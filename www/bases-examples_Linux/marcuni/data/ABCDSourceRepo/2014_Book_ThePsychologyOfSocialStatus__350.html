<p>There has never been a more exciting time to study social status and hierarchy. 
Over the past several decades, researchers from across the social sciences have 
come to recognize the importance, complexity, and ubiquity of individual differ-
ences in social rank. These scholars have made great strides in shedding light on 
such fascinating yet long perplexing questions as: Why are societies everywhere 
structured hierarchically? What function might hierarchy serve, for individuals and 
for groups? How do rank differences emerge, and what determines who rises to the 
top? What are the psychological, neural, and hormonal mechanisms that underlie 
status attainment? What are the consequences of high and low rank on relationships, 
mating, and reproductive success? Psychologists, neuroscientists, health research-
ers, sociologists, anthropologists, and management scientists are working together 
to seek answers to these questions, and to build a comprehensive and interdisciplin-
ary science of the psychological underpinnings of social status.
</p>
<p>This volume was conceived several years ago when we were attending the an-
nual Society for Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP) conference, the single 
largest annual meeting place for social and personality psychologists. As research-
ers broadly interested in the psychology of social status and rank dynamics, we were 
naturally attracted to many symposia sessions and presentations themed around the 
topic of power and status. One thing we noticed, however, was that the research 
agenda seemed to be dominated, to a certain extent, by power&mdash;or institutionally 
driven rank differentials (exemplified by a boss/employee relationship)&mdash;to the ne-
glect of research on social status and dominance&mdash;or naturally emerging hierarchi-
cal differences that arise in everyday interpersonal relationships. Further reflecting 
this state of affairs, an excellent volume reviewing the extant literature on power 
was published several years ago (Guinote and Vescio 2010), but the present volume 
marks the first comprehensive review of research on the psychology of status and 
broader rank-attainment processes.
</p>
<p>Although there are important similarities between power and status, the two 
concepts are quite notably distinct. Whereas status refers to a form of influence 
and control that arises spontaneously in everyday social situations, power involves 
formally endowed control over valued resources, often resulting from institution-
ally legitimized positions in the workplace, politics, or broader society. As a result, </p>

</p>
<p>while many of the consequences may be similar, the psychological underpinnings 
of status and related processes are unique from those that lead to power. Given this 
distinction, we believed that the field was in need of a book dedicated to the large 
bodies of research that have emerged on status and naturally occurring social rank.
</p>
<p>With this volume, our goal was to showcase the major foundational insights that 
have emerged to date on the psychology of social status. The scientific study of 
status&mdash;which began over 40 years ago with classic studies in sociology by Berger, 
Ridgeway, Driskell, and others&mdash;has grown tremendously in recent years. Many 
of the most influential psychology papers on the topic&mdash;such as those by Tiedens, 
Anderson, and Willer, to name a few&mdash;were published within the last 15 years. 
Moreover, the study of status has become an interdisciplinary enterprise, crossing 
the boundaries of sociology, psychology, organizational science, anthropology, and 
other fields. Essential to this volume is the inclusion and synthesis of these inter-
disciplinary approaches. Among the 16 chapters included are the latest perspectives 
and cutting-edge empirical findings from across these disciplines; contributors in-
clude social, personality and evolutionary psychologists, organizational scientists, 
sociologists, and anthropologists. Furthermore, all of these contributors are leading 
experts in the field, whose work has broken theoretical and empirical ground. It 
is our hope that this collection will provide a one-stop shop for those who wish to 
learn about the latest and most important developments in this flourishing area of 
research.
</p>
<p>This volume is divided into five sections. The first section provides an over-
view of prominent overarching theoretical perspectives that have shaped much of 
the current research agenda on social status. These chapters lay out the theoretical 
foundations for much of the rest of the work presented in the volume, and address 
core questions about the nature of social status and hierarchy. In Chap. 1, Cheng 
and Tracy explore the evolutionary origins of human status hierarchies, and review 
a large body of evidence supporting the Dominance-Prestige theoretical account. 
According to this model, there are two fundamental pathways to social rank attain-
ment in human societies: dominance (inducing fear in others) and prestige (gain-
ing others&rsquo; respect). In Chap. 2, Barkow explores the evolutionary emergence of 
prestige, and discusses the pivotal role of culture and cultural transmission in the 
rise of complex, socially stratified groups and societies, from an anthropological 
perspective. Complementing these chapters on the distal forces that favor the emer-
gence of hierarchical relationships, in Chap. 3 Anderson and Willer offer a broad 
account of the proximal drivers of status allocation. They argue that, although hu-
mans are motivated to develop hierarchies based on prestige&mdash;by allocating social 
rank only to the most skilled and committed group members&mdash;their ability to do so 
is constrained by a number of interesting psychological biases and traps. Finally, 
in Chap. 4 Blader and Chen synthesize across these distinct theoretical perspec-
tives to explore the multidimensional nature of hierarchical relationships, with a 
close review of the conceptual overlap and distinctions among these diverse forms 
of hierarchy. This chapter helps to explain the different ways in which researchers 
have conceptualized each of the key constructs relevant to the central topic of this </p>

</p>
<p>volume: status, power, influence, socioeconomic status, leadership, dominance, and 
prestige.
</p>
<p>The second section of the volume examines the personality, demographic, situ-
ational, psychological, emotional, and cultural underpinnings of status attainment. 
This section, in essence, addresses questions about who attains status, and why. 
In Chap. 5, Anderson and Cowan survey the extant empirical research on the per-
sonality determinants of status attainment. They find that high status individuals 
consistently exhibit lower neuroticism but greater extraversion, dominance, and 
self-monitoring, and, in some group contexts, greater conscientiousness, narcis-
sism, and openness to experience. Moving beyond personality, in Chap. 6 Blaker 
and van Vugt examine the link between physical stature and social status. Their re-
view indicates that physical attributes such as height and muscularity promote rank, 
but through different mechanisms. Whereas tall individuals acquire status via both 
dominance and prestige, the high rank of muscular individuals results from domi-
nance. In Chap. 7, Kafashan, Sparks, Griskevicius, and Barclay explore the com-
plex bidirectional associations between prosocial behavior and status attainment. 
Certain forms of prosocial behavior, they suggest, both influence and is affected by 
status gains to a greater extent than others.
</p>
<p>In Chap. 8, Leary, Jongman-Sereno, and Diebels offer insights into the psycho-
logical processes that underpin individuals&rsquo; pursuit of status, and focus specifically 
on the role of impression management&mdash;the attempt to shape and influence one&rsquo;s 
reputation and public perception. Their theoretical analysis shows that acts of self-
presentation are not only pervasive in status pursuits, but also entail a delicate and 
difficult balance between the often conflicting goals of getting ahead and getting 
along. In Chap. 9 von Rueden addresses the universality of social hierarchy from a 
cultural anthropological perspective. As his review of ethnographies and recent em-
pirical work in small-scale societies reveals, hierarchy is a human universal, found 
even in highly egalitarian foraging and horticultural societies. Interestingly, status 
in these populations is largely determined by a similar suite of factors observed in 
industrial societies&mdash;such as skill and generosity, or prestige more broadly, as well 
as physical stature. He shows that men&rsquo;s status bears important consequences for his 
reproductive success. Finally, in Chap. 10 Steckler and Tracy provide an in-depth 
overview of the distinct emotional underpinnings of status hierarchy. They highlight 
the critical functions that basic emotions&mdash;such as happiness, sadness, anger, dis-
gust, and fear&mdash;and more complex social emotions&mdash;pride, shame, envy, contempt, 
and admiration&mdash;serve in facilitating hierarchy navigation.
</p>
<p>The volume&rsquo;s third section focuses on the intra- and inter-personal benefits and 
costs of possessing and lacking status, examining the downstream consequences of 
high and low status on cognition, self-perception, and interpersonal and inter-group 
relations. In Chap. 11 Fast and Joshi explore two fundamental cognitive forces&mdash;
subjective sense of control and role expectations&mdash;that are triggered by high rank, 
and examine the benefits and barriers that these forces present in organizational 
settings. They argue that these rank-related cognitions are not always advantageous, 
and in fact often create surprising barriers for those atop the social hierarchy in 
domains such as decision-making, task performance, social relationships, and well-</p>

</p>
<p>being. Broadening the scope to status hierarchies that exist at a societal level, in 
Chap. 12 North and Fiske discuss prevailing sociological and psychological in-
sights into social inequality. Their review highlights the socio-structural forces, cul-
tural stereotypes, and other psychological biases that jointly create and sustain so-
cial inequality and prejudice among groups who differ in race, gender, age, weight, 
sexuality, and social class.
</p>
<p>The volume&rsquo;s fourth section reviews emerging research on the biological and 
bodily manifestation of status attainment, identifying specific endocrinologies, neu-
ral systems, and nonverbal behaviors that create and reflect status differences. In 
Chap. 13, Knight and Mehta review the mounting empirical findings on the neuroen-
docrinologies that underpin hierarchical differences. This body of research provides 
compelling evidence for complex reciprocal relations between status attainment and 
a number of hormones&mdash;namely testosterone, cortisol, estradiol, and oxytocin&mdash;in 
both humans and nonhuman animals. In Chap. 14 Pornpattananangkul, Zink, and 
Chiao provide an overview of research on the neural networks and patterns that 
encode status-related information in the human brain. Their review indicates that 
the serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems&mdash;which are regulated 
by intricate gene-by-environment interactions&mdash;play pivotal roles in facilitating the 
perception, recognition, and expression of dominance and submission patterns in 
humans and other species. In Chap. 15, Hall, Latu, Carney, and Schmid Mast sum-
marize the large bodies of research on the nonverbal expression of status. As they 
show, high and low relative rank are each associated with distinct nonverbal cues 
emitted from the face, eyes, body, and voice. By signaling one&rsquo;s rank position to 
others and activating rank-related cognitions and behavioral patterns, these cues 
both shape and reflect individuals&rsquo; rank in complex yet predictable ways.
</p>
<p>Finally, the fifth section of the volume is comprised of a single stand-alone chap-
ter by Cheng, Weidman, and Tracy, which provides a broad review of available 
research methods for measuring and experimentally manipulating social status. The 
goal of this review is to provide researchers with an easy-to-access means of de-
termining how best to measure or manipulate the status-related constructs in which 
they are interested. Together, these 16 chapters collectively form what we hope to 
be a useful resource for researchers, students, policy-makers, and others interested 
in learning about the remarkable proliferation of knowledge that has accumulated 
across many decades of research, along with the latest and most exciting theoretical 
and empirical insights into human social status dynamics.

<p>A volume of this scope would not have been possible without the help of many 
individuals. First and foremost, we are extremely grateful to each and every one of 
the volume&rsquo;s contributors, who generously devoted their time and energy to this 
project. Our heartfelt appreciation also goes to the editors at Springer, in particular 
Morgan Ryan and Anna Tobias, for their encouragement and support throughout 
this project. Finally, we thank our publisher, Springer, without whom this effort 
would not be possible.

<p>Although affiliative and cooperative interactions form the primary fabric of human 
social relationships, group living necessarily entails conflict over divergent goals and 
competition over scarce resources. The formation of social hierarchies, an organiza-
tional structure observed across many species in the animal kingdom and ubiquitous 
to human groups, presents a solution to these conflicts. Although the bases on which 
humans form hierarchies and allocate rank are diverse, hierarchies are fundamentally 
social structures in which high-ranking individuals reliably receive greater influence, 
deference, attention, and valued resources than low-ranking others (Homans 1950, 
1961; Magee and Galinsky 2008; Mazur 1973, 1985; Strodtbeck 1951; Zitek and 
Tiedens 2012). By affording high-ranking individuals privileged influence and access 
to valued resources such as mates and food, mutually accepted hierarchical relation-
ships minimize costly agonistic conflicts, establish order, and facilitate coordination 
and cooperation among individuals in groups (B&aacute;les 1950; Berger et al. 1980). In-
deed, a substantial body of evidence indicates that stable social hierarchies, in which 
subordinates defer to rather than dispute or contest their high-ranking counterparts, 
generally result in better group coordination and performance and more satisfying 
relationships (e.g., Halevy et al. 2011; Kwaadsteniet and van Dijk 2010; Ronay et al. 
2012; Tiedens and Fragale 2003; Tiedens et al. 2007; see also Anderson and Willer, 
Chap. 3, this volume).
</p>
<p>Despite the fundamental importance of social hierarchies to human relation-
ships, however, questions remain about the processes that allow individuals to attain 
rank and the factors that determine rank allocation. Although an extensive literature 
has documented a wide range of micro-level attributes and behaviors that influence 
rank attainment, these findings lack a coherent, unifying framework integrating the 
various data points into a comprehensive and theoretically supported understanding 
of rank differentiation. To address this disparity, we have adopted a parsimonious </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4 J. T. Cheng and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>and empirically supported evolutionary model, the Dominance-Prestige Account 
(Cheng et al. 2010, 2013a; Henrich and Gil-White 2001), which we believe can 
unify the diverse extant findings. This account proposes that differences in hierar-
chical rank within human social groups are the result of both: (a) coerced deference 
to dominant others who induce fear by virtue of their ability to inflict physical or 
psychological harm (i.e., Dominance) and (b) freely conferred deference to presti-
gious others who possess valued skills and abilities (i.e., Prestige).
</p>
<p>This chapter provides a broad review of the extant research regarding rank allo-
cation processes, by surveying findings from the major disciplines that have studied 
human rank dynamics empirically, including psychology, sociology, management 
science, and anthropology. We argue that the Dominance-Prestige Account can be 
fruitfully applied to organize these diverse empirical findings&mdash;including those that 
appear, at first glance, to be conflicting. The Dominance-Prestige Account not only 
allows for and predicts the diversity of results that have emerged in the prior lit-
erature, but also goes beyond many prior descriptive accounts to provide a deep 
theoretical explanation for the extant body of work.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that, in contrast to many other chapters in this volume that 
focus more specifically on one particular dimension of social rank involving respect 
and admiration (often referred to as status; e.g., Anderson and Kilduff 2009a), our 
focus is on the determinants of social rank broadly construed, a concept that reflects 
the degree of influence one possesses over resource allocation, conflict resolution, 
and group decisions (Berger et al. 1980; for further discussion of hierarchy-related 
conceptual terms, see Blader and Chen, Chap. 4, this volume; Cheng et al. 2013e).
</p>
<p>The present review is organized into three sections. First, we discuss the key te-
nets of the Dominance-Prestige Account, outlining the selection pressures theorized 
to favor the evolution of these two distinct forms of social rank inequalities in hu-
mans, and the psychological processes that underpin them. Second, we discuss find-
ings from our own recent work that directly support this account, by demonstrating 
(a) the co-existing effectiveness of Dominance and Prestige in promoting social 
rank and (b) the distinction between Dominance and Prestige as separate rank-at-
tainment processes, wherein each is underpinned by a distinct suite of personality 
profiles, emotional mechanisms, behavioral patterns, cognitions, neuroendocrine 
profiles, and fitness outcomes. Third, we summarize a number of predictions that 
the Dominance-Prestige Account entails regarding the relevance of a wide range of 
narrow, lower-order traits, and attributes to rank attainment, and examine the fit of 
these predictions to the prior empirical literature. Taken together, this substantial 
body of research converges to suggest that intimidation and respect co-exist as two 
fundamental yet distinct bases of rank differentiation in human societies.
</p>
<p>The Dominance-Prestige Account of Social Rank 
</p>
<p>Differentiation
</p>
<p>The Dominance-Prestige Account (Henrich and Gil-White 2001) holds that social 
hierarchies are multidimensional, arising from two systems of rank allocation. In 
contrast to prior accounts of hierarchy differentiation (e.g., Anderson and Kilduff </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>51 Toward a Unified Science of Hierarchy
</p>
<p>2009a; Berger et al. 1972; Lee and Ofshe 1981; Magee and Galinsky 2008; Mazur 
1973), the Dominance-Prestige Account argues explicitly, on the basis of evolution-
ary logic, that both avenues persist in contemporary human groups, and produce 
patterns of behaviors and tactics that effectively promote influence over others, 
even when wielded within the same social group.
</p>
<p>First, Dominance entails the induction of fear, through intimidation and coer-
cion, to attain or maintain rank and influence, and is thought to be homologous 
with dominance hierarchical systems in nonhuman primates that result from ago-
nistic contests (Chase et al. 2002; Rowell 1974). In humans, Dominance can be 
observed in dyadic social relationships based on coercion, such as those between 
police and citizen, bully and victim, or boss and employee, as well as in larger 
social structures. Dominant individuals effectively instill fear in subordinates, typi-
cally through threats that are more psychological than physical. For example, those 
with formal institutional power, such as employers, can evoke fear in subordinates 
by threatening to provide or withhold resources. Subordinates respond by comply-
ing with the demands of Dominant individuals to safeguard their well-being and 
resources. Consequently, Dominance begets substantial social influence, rooted in 
coercive compliance. It is theorized that Dominance arose in evolutionary history 
in response to agonistic conflicts over material resources (e.g., food, mates), which 
were common among nonhuman species, but also persist in contemporary human 
societies in the form of psychological conflicts. By regulating patterns of domi-
nation-deference, Dominance hierarchies facilitate coordination and minimize the 
frequency of agonistic encounters and associated costs, and, as a result, enhance the 
fitness of all parties involved. It is noteworthy that numerous others have previously 
argued for the importance of Dominance-related processes in hierarchy formation, 
typically pointing to the prevalence of agonistic contests in human social life, as 
well as the tendency for competitive outcomes to govern patterns of domination 
and subordination in virtually all animals species (e.g., Chagnon 1983; Mazur 1973, 
1985; Lee and Ofshe 1981; Mazur and Booth 1998). In contrast to prior models, 
however, the present account proposes that coercion and intimidation are not the 
only means to human social-rank attainment; rather, a secondary pathway, termed 
Prestige, is thought to co-exist and operate concurrently.
</p>
<p>Prestige refers to influence that is willingly granted to individuals who are recog-
nized and respected for their skills, success, or knowledge. Subordinates seek out the 
opinions and company of Prestigious individuals in efforts to imitate and learn their 
superior skills or knowledge. As a result, the Prestigious are conferred with influence 
and rank, which in their cases rests on freely conferred deference and genuine persua-
sion, rather than forced compliance. Prestige-based rank is thought to be unique to hu-
mans, because it relies on cultural learning, which is considered to be less developed 
in other animals (Boyd and Richerson 1985; Laland and Galef 2009). Learning from 
the most skilled group members is a low-cost way of acquiring fitness-maximizing 
knowledge, so the emergence of cultural learning in early human evolutionary his-
tory likely generated selection pressures to preferentially identify, attend to, and copy 
knowledge from highly skilled or successful others. These selection pressures would 
favor a psychological machinery capable of differentiating and ranking individuals 
along the dimension of skill (and, thus, Prestige), such that the highest quality cultural 
models with the greatest expertise are elevated to the top of the hierarchy.</p>
<p/>

<p>6 J. T. Cheng and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>The assumption that earned respect represents a fundamental path to rank attain-
ment in humans is consistent with the predominant view of rank attainment within 
social psychology, which assumes that hierarchical differences result from groups 
members&rsquo; rational and freely chosen decisions to confer rank upon those individu-
als who possess and offer the greatest skills and ability to contribute to the group 
(e.g., Anderson and Kilduff 2009a; Berger et al. 1972; Blau 1964; Thibaut and Kel-
ley 1959; Ridgeway and Diekema 1989). In contrast to the Dominance-Prestige 
Account, however, this perspective holds that social influence is acquired only via 
this merit-based route, and cannot be acquired via force or coercion (e.g., Anderson 
and Kilduff 2009a; Barkow 1975; Ridgeway 1987; Ridgeway and Diekema 1989).
</p>
<p>The distinction between Dominance and Prestige parallels Krackle&rsquo;s (1978) 
delineation of two kinds of leadership in simpler societies: &ldquo;forceful&rdquo; leaders, or 
domineering headmen who maintain their position and power through the induc-
tion of fear, threat, and compulsion, versus &ldquo;persuasive&rdquo; leaders, who lack formal 
authority but nevertheless exercise substantial influence that is dependent on the 
consent of their followers. Similar contrasts have also been observed by scholars 
distinguishing between &ldquo;agonic&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;hedonic&rdquo; behavior (Chance and Jolly 1970) 
and &ldquo;resource-holding potential&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;social attention holding power&rdquo; (e.g., Gilbert 
et al. 1995).
</p>
<p>However, unlike these prior descriptive taxonomies, the Dominance-Prestige 
Account was theoretically derived and provides an evolutionarily based explana-
tion of why these widely observed patterns occur. The strong theoretical basis of this 
account allows for the formulation of precise yet broad predictions regarding the 
suites of traits, emotions, cognitions, and behaviors expected to propel and underpin 
these two avenues to rank. Furthermore, this account is unique, in that it incorpo-
rates both our species&rsquo; shared heritage with other primates who resolve conflicts 
through domination-subordination coordination, and our unique human nature as 
cultural beings who depend heavily on cultural learning (Henrich and Gil-White 
2001). The account&rsquo;s breadth also gives it the potential to unify prior theoretical ef-
forts and to integrate the somewhat scattered extant literature on power, status, and 
leadership into a coherent account, by parsing these prior results into Dominance- 
or Prestige-based processes.
</p>
<p>Evidence Supporting the Dominance-Prestige Account
</p>
<p>The account outlined above generates two key predictions about social-rank dy-
namics. First, Dominance and Prestige should concurrently promote social rank in 
groups. Second, because these two strategies are the products of distinct selection 
pressures, they should be associated with distinct underlying psychological pro-
cesses and patterns of behavior. Here, we review findings from recent studies that 
directly tested these two predictions.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Dominance and Prestige Both Promote Social Rank
</p>
<p>We recently tested the central theoretical prediction of the Dominance-Prestige Ac-
count&mdash;that both these pathways effectively promote social rank&mdash;by examining 
the impact of these broad-level status-attainment strategies on rank attainment in 
small groups (Cheng et al. 2013e). In the first of two studies, we assigned par-
ticipants to small same-sex groups. These individuals independently completed 
a survival exercise (Bottger 1984), which involved rank-ordering 15 items (e.g., 
oxygen tanks, heating unit) in order of their utility for surviving a disaster. They 
next worked collectively as a group for 20 min on the same task. Upon completing 
the group task, participants privately rated each other (in a round-robin design) on 
perceived social influence, Dominance, and Prestige; peer-rated Dominance and 
Prestige were assessed via previously validated scales, which capture the extent to 
which group members experience fear and admiration, respectively, toward each 
other group member (see Cheng et al. 2010). We also obtained a behavioral measure 
of influence by computing the degree of similarity between each participant&rsquo;s pri-
vate response on the survival task and the group&rsquo;s final response, under the assump-
tion that influential members would more effectively sway the group toward adopt-
ing their opinions. Finally, upon the completion of all sessions, outside observers 
watched video-recordings of the group interactions and rated all participants on the 
same dimensions as the in-lab peers. In a second study, na&iuml;ve observers watched 
these same video recordings while their gaze was monitored with an eye-tracking 
device, and subsequently rated each group member on Dominance and Prestige. 
Together, this approach generated four separate indices of social rank: (a) group 
member-ratings of social influence, (b) outside observer-ratings of social influence, 
(c) decision-making impact, and (d) visual attention received&mdash;which has been de-
scribed as &ldquo;the best framework for analyzing social rank as it takes into account all 
leadership styles&rdquo; (Hold 1976, p. 179).
</p>
<p>Results provided convergent support for the two proposed pathways to social 
rank: Individuals who adopted either a Dominance or Prestige strategy attained 
higher social rank. Specifically, not only were these individuals seen as more influ-
ential by both group members and outside observers, but they in fact exerted greater 
behavioral influence, as indexed by the measures of decision-making impact and 
attention. Furthermore, two other sets of findings provided evidence for the inde-
pendence of these two rank-attainment pathways and their divergent psychological 
underpinnings. First, Dominance and Prestige were statistically independent, and 
the rank-promoting effect of each emerged even when controlling for shared vari-
ance with the other&mdash;suggesting that dominant individuals&rsquo; ability to gain influence 
cannot be attributed to a tendency among group members to (incorrectly) perceive 
them as more competent or admirable (and by implication, Prestigious; cf., Ander-
son and Kilduff 2009b).
</p>
<p>Second, findings from our more recent study provide direct evidence that&mdash;in 
contrast to Prestigious individuals, whose influence is predicated upon perceived 
competence and value&mdash;Dominant individuals&rsquo; elevated rank results from others&rsquo; 
</p>

</p>
<p>fear and not from a perception that they are contributing value to the group (Cheng 
et al. 2013a). Although Dominants tended to forcefully dominate group discussions 
by speaking longer and occupying the floor to a greater extent than Prestigious indi-
viduals in small task groups (Cheng et al. 2013e), in a recent study examining simi-
lar group interactions, we found that group members&rsquo; perceptions of each other&rsquo;s 
contribution was much more strongly associated with Prestige ( r = .70; p &lt; .001) 
than with Dominance ( r = .29; p &lt; .001; Z = &minus; 6.102, p &lt; .001). Moreover, replicat-
ing our previous finding, both Dominance and Prestige predicted greater group-
member-rated influence ( rs = .48 and .52; ps &lt; .001). However, when perceived con-
tribution was statistically controlled (using partial correlations), only the relation 
between Dominance and influence remained strong and significant ( r = .41), and did 
not show a significant reduction in its magnitude ( Z = .97, p = .33); the association 
between Prestige and influence after controlling for contribution ( r = .10, p = .13), 
on the other hand, was substantially reduced ( Z = 5.27, p &lt; .0001). Furthermore, 
consistent with our account, when fear experienced toward each individual (&ldquo;I am 
afraid of him/her&rdquo;) was controlled for, the relation between Dominance and influ-
ence was not only significantly reduced in magnitude, but also no longer different 
from zero ( r = .09, p = .16; Z = 3.73, p &lt; .001). In contrast, accounting for fear did 
not significantly alter the relation between Prestige and influence ( r = .56, p &lt; .001; 
Z = &minus; .66, p = .51). These results indicate that while the apparent value and contribu-
tion provided by Prestigious individuals are vital to, and account almost entirely 
for, their rank attainment, these attributes do not explain the social influence of 
Dominant individuals, who gain and maintain rank not by contributing value to the 
group, but by inducing fear.
</p>
<p>More broadly, these findings offer first evidence supporting the claim that Domi-
nance leads to increased social rank, a contentious notion that has been the topic of 
considerable theoretical debate (see Anderson and Kilduff 2009a; Carli et al. 1995; 
Lee and Ofshe 1981; Ridgeway and Diekema 1989). Over two decades ago, in a 
series of methodologically similar studies (e.g., Carli et al. 1995; Copeland et al. 
1995; Driskell et al. 1993; Ridgeway 1987; Ridgeway and Diekema 1989), the 
opinions advocated by confederates who displayed domineering behaviors&mdash;such 
as dismissive and contemptuous speech, or a looming posture and angry tone&mdash;were 
consistently found to be no more readily adopted than those of confederates who 
appeared more neutral or submissive. Although these results have been interpreted 
to demonstrate the futility of Dominance for ascending social hierarchies, two im-
portant aspects of the study design raise concerns about this inference.
</p>
<p>First, these studies (inadvertently) examined the consequences of failed attempts 
at invoking fear. Despite their display of aggressive and threatening behaviors, con-
federates either posed no real threat to participants because they were present only 
via video-recording (e.g., Carli et al. 1995; Copeland et al. 1995; Driskell et al. 
1993; Ridgeway 1987), or were actively resisted and challenged with reciprocal 
aggressive acts (e.g., Copeland et al. 1995; Ridgeway and Diekema 1989), indicat-
ing the absence of fear and thus an ineffective adoption of the Dominance strategy 
(Chase et al. 2002).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9
</p>
<p>Second, all of these studies (e.g., Carli et al. 1995; Driskell et al. 1993; Ridgeway 
1987; Ridgeway and Diekema 1989) assessed persuasion&mdash;a unique component of 
influence that entails private, internalized shifts in behaviors, ideas, values, or opin-
ions (Wood 2000)&mdash;but not other forms of deference or influence. Importantly, our 
theory predicts a priori that, unlike Prestigious individuals whose influence is based 
on genuine persuasion and imitation, the influence of Dominant individuals is mo-
tivated by subordinate appeasement, and is thus a matter of compliance rather than 
actual persuasion (i.e., subordinates submit to the wishes of Dominants because 
they fear the consequences of nonsubmission, not because they come to genuinely 
adopt the Dominants&rsquo; opinions; see Henrich and Gil-White 2001, p. 186). In our 
studies, which were designed to circumvent these limitations, we examined general-
ized influence more broadly (incorporating both compliance and persuasion), and 
found that it is heavily determined by the effective pursuit of Dominance (opera-
tionalized as group members&rsquo; subjective reports of experienced fear, intimidation, 
and related perceptions).
</p>
<p>As a final point on this matter, although research on organizational effectiveness 
has found that &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; tactics&mdash;which involve the use of demands, threat, and 
intimidation to influence others (and thus are akin to Dominance)&mdash;generally result 
in less successful and productive leadership, these findings address the effects of 
Dominance-based leadership on performance and other work outcomes, and should 
not be taken as direct evidence against or for the question of whether Dominance 
promotes social rank. The Dominance account holds that force and intimidation 
leads to submission and the conferral of influence and rank, but inherently makes 
no strong predictions about the quality of the behavior enacted out of coercion. It 
can be speculated, however, that because subordinates of Dominant leaders comply 
with their requests out of fear and harm avoidance, rather than genuine commit-
ment, their influence will be met with resistance and the task behavior enacted by 
subordinates will generally be of poorer quality and performance. Consistent with 
this, a growing body of evidence appears to suggest that not only is Dominance-
based leadership seen as an ineffective approach and frequently resisted by sub-
ordinates (e.g., Falbe and Yukl 1992; Kipnis and Schmidt 1988; Yukl and Tracey 
1992), but it can also bear counterproductive effects on workplace performance and 
subordinate commitment (e.g., Falbe and Yukl 1992; Higgins et al. 2003; Yukl et al. 
1996). Nevertheless, these findings address a distinct question, and do not directly 
indicate the basic efficacy of Dominance for acquiring rank and influence.
</p>
<p>Dominance and Prestige are Distinct
</p>
<p>If Dominance and Prestige indeed form the dual core foundations of human so-
cial hierarchies, they should not only concurrently promote social rank, but should 
also represent distinct pathways to high rank. The theoretical distinction between 
the two pathways&mdash;Dominance predicated upon fear and intimidation, and Prestige 
upon obtaining respect and admiration&mdash;leads to the prediction that the two avenues 
</p>

<p/>
</div>

<p>10 J. T. Cheng and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>should be underpinned by distinct psychological and behavioral patterns, which 
would allow their adopters to effectively intimidate (in the case of Dominance), or 
garner respect and admiration (in the case of Prestige). This prediction has received 
support from several recent lines of research, which have directly assessed and con-
trasted Dominance and Prestige by examining their associated behavioral patterns 
and fitness-related outcomes.
</p>
<p>Distinct Personality and Emotional Profiles First, the pursuit of Dominance and 
Prestige are associated with different suites of interpersonal behaviors, personal-
ity traits, competencies, and emotional mechanisms. Consistent with evolutionary 
reasoning about the freely conferred versus coercive nature of their acquired rank, 
Prestigious individuals are perceived by group members as highly likeable, whereas 
Dominant individuals are not particularly well liked (Cheng et al. 2013e). Further-
more, the two pathways diverge in their associated interpersonal behaviors, based 
on correlations with traits that comprise the interpersonal circumplex framework 
(i.e. agency and communion; Bakan 1966; Wiggins 1979). Whereas Prestigious 
individuals are perceived by peers as highly agentic and highly communal, Domi-
nants are perceived as highly agentic but low in communion (Cheng et al. 2013b). 
These findings suggest that, as a result of their contrasting communal orientations, 
Dominance and Prestige represent distinct ways of exerting agency. Further sup-
porting this interpersonal distinction, individuals predisposed to pursue Dominance 
tend to rate themselves as aggressive, disagreeable, narcissistic, and manipulative, 
whereas those predisposed to pursue Prestige tend to rate themselves as conscien-
tious, agreeable, and possessing high self-esteem (Buttermore 2006; Cheng et al. 
2010). Prestigious individuals also demonstrate lower-levels of basal Testosterone 
(Johnson et al. 2007), an androgenic hormone linked to aggression (Giammanco 
et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>In addition, Prestigious individuals demonstrate locally valued competencies 
and skills, but this is not the case for Dominants. For example, in the context of 
collegiate varsity teams, peer-rated Prestige is positively related to each teammate&rsquo;s 
level of academic achievement and athletic, social, intellectual, and advice-giving 
abilities (Cheng et al. 2010). Likewise, in the context of a small-scale Amazonian 
society, perceived prestige is positively related to hunting ability, skill in food pro-
duction, generosity, number of allies, and nutritional status (Reyes-Garcia et al. 
2008, 2009; von Rueden et al. 2008). Furthermore, other prosocial traits that effec-
tively broadcast one&rsquo;s expertise and social attractiveness (i.e., his/her viability as a 
cultural model), such as altruism, cooperativeness, helpfulness, ethicality, concern 
for the public good, are positively related to Prestige, but negatively to Dominance 
(Cheng et al. 2010; Maner and Mead 2010, 2012).1
</p>
<p>1 Although altruism and generosity increase perceived Prestige (Cheng et al. 2010; Willer 2009), 
in times of conflict unconditional prosociality&mdash;altruism directed toward out-groups as well as 
one&rsquo;s own in-group&mdash;can reduce perceived Prestige, as such behaviors undermine perceptions of 
group commitment and loyalty (Halevy et al. 2012). However, invoking unnecessary harm upon 
an out-group (without benefiting in-group members) increases perceived Dominance.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11
</p>
<p>In contrast, Dominance is associated with a selfish disregard for the well-being 
of one&rsquo;s group. For example, when presented with a choice between personal bene-
fits and collective success, Dominant leaders prioritize their own gains over those of 
others (Maner and Mead 2010, 2012). Furthermore, individuals who pursue Domi-
nance tend to be fueled by the arrogant, conceit-based &ldquo;hubristic&rdquo; pride, whereas 
those who pursue Prestige are fueled by a more pro-social, competence-based &ldquo;au-
thentic&rdquo; pride (Cheng et al. 2010).
</p>
<p>Distinct Behavioral Patterns Second, we have found that Dominance and Pres-
tige are associated with distinct characteristic verbal, nonverbal, and vocal behav-
ioral patterns. During social interactions, Dominant individuals tend to engage in 
an intimidating and self-entitling verbal style that evokes fear and coercion (e.g., 
teasing others in a dominant way, forcefully pushing one&rsquo;s own ideas or opinions). 
In contrast, Prestigious individuals demonstrate a socially attractive verbal style 
that entails displaying warmth and self-deprecation (e.g., teasing others in a flatter-
ing way, seeking the group&rsquo;s approval on matters; Cheng et al. 2013b). Similarly, 
Dominant individuals tend to show spatially expansive postural displays (e.g., wide 
postures) in group situations, whereas Prestigious individuals display more subtle, 
nonthreatening movements that communicate confidence and competence, such as 
the pride display (e.g., small smile, head tilt up, chest expansion; Tracy and Robins 
2004; Cheng et al. 2013b). Finally, Dominant individuals tend to deepen their vocal 
pitch in the initial minutes of an unscripted social interaction (Cheng et al. 2013d), 
which likely serves to increase their perceived threat potential and formidability 
(Puts et al. 2012). In contrast, Prestige is not associated with systematic changes in 
vocal pitch, consistent with the expectation that pitch deepening amplifies threat but 
does not influence perceived competence or respect.
</p>
<p>Distinct Fitness-Related Outcomes Third, several other lines of work suggest 
that the pursuit of these two-rank pathways may entail distinct fitness-related con-
sequences. For example, Prestigious villagers in Tsimane&rsquo;, a small-scale forager-
farmer society, tend to more healthy than the average group member (on the basis of 
current nutritional status), whereas no effect was observed for Dominance (Reyes-
Garcia et al. 2009). This distinction may result from the theoretical expectation that 
Dominance depends on frequent assertions of intimidation and threat which would 
entail greater biological costs (including increased stress) compared to Prestige&mdash;
given that Prestigious individuals acquire access to resources and privileges through 
freely conferred deference. These biological costs might wash out the nutritional 
benefits that should accompany the greater flow of resources to those who effec-
tively invoke Dominance.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, both forms of rank appear to facilitate success in mate attraction 
and reproduction, albeit via different mechanisms. Although women generally in-
dicate a preference for male targets described as Prestigious over those described 
as Dominant, highly Dominant men (relative to less Dominant men) are deemed no 
less&mdash;and in some contexts (such as in a competition) even more&mdash;attractive and 
desirable as short-term mates (Sadalla et al. 1987; Snyder et al. 2008). In addition, 
research among the Tsimane&rsquo; found that Dominance and Prestige both predict great-

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 J. T. Cheng and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>er reproductive success in men, though in different ways: Dominant and Prestigious 
men both have higher fertility (i.e., greater number of children), but Prestigious men 
additionally exhibit lower offspring mortality (von Rueden et al. 2011).
</p>
<p>Overall, the theoretical distinction between Dominance and Prestige has been 
supported by a diverse range of findings, which, together, indicate that the two path-
ways to rank are underpinned by distinct suites of personality traits, emotional and 
neuroendocrine mechanisms, behavioral displays, and fitness-related outcomes.
</p>
<p>The Dominance-Prestige Account Helps Integrate Prior 
</p>
<p>Findings on Social Rank
</p>
<p>The recognition that Dominance and Prestige form the core foundations of social 
rank in humans implies that these dynamics should jointly account for a vast range 
of previously observed rank-related phenomena. Specifically, we propose that the 
constellation of narrow lower-order traits and attributes that have been empirically 
linked to social rank can be best understood within the Dominance-Prestige frame-
work. In the remainder of this chapter, we review this fairly large literature, and, for 
each finding, briefly explain how it can be understood as a Dominance- or Prestige-
related process. In doing so, we devote greater attention to evidence supporting 
Dominance-based rank-attainment processes, given relatively greater controversy 
on this issue within the social psychological and management literatures (see An-
derson and Kilduff 2009a).
</p>
<p>Dominance Promotes Social Rank
</p>
<p>Numerous lines of research indicate that hierarchical relationships in humans are, 
to a large extent, shaped by interactions involving threat and intimidation. Indeed, 
six separate lines of work have demonstrated associations between an actual or 
perceived ability to inflict harm and elevated social influence. Specifically, studies 
have linked increased rank to each of the following Dominance-linked behaviors 
and attributes: (a) coercion and aggression, (b) personality dominance, (c) physical 
size and strength, (d) facial structure, (e) vocal pitch, and (f) spatially expansive 
nonverbal displays.
</p>
<p>Coercion and Aggression According to the Dominance-Prestige Account, direct 
or indirect displays of physical, psychological, or verbal aggression are the pri-
mary routes through which Dominant individuals attain influence. Consistent with 
this prediction, studies have found that acts of aggression, coercion, threats, der-
ogation, debasement, and manipulation are frequently reported ways of &ldquo;getting 
ahead&rdquo; and influencing others (Buss et al. 1987; Howard et al. 1986; Kyl-Heku 
and Buss 1996). Conversely, the experimental induction of rank-attainment motives 
or assignment to a leadership role leads individuals to report increased aggressive </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13
</p>
<p>intentions (Griskevicius et al. 2009). Interestingly, other studies have found that the 
highest-level of abusive behavior is displayed by those who feel incompetent (i.e., 
who lack Prestige), suggesting that aggression may provide a means of attaining 
influence when the Prestige pathway is inaccessible (Fast and Chen 2009; Fast et al. 
2012). Moreover, studies on hierarchical relationships suggest that the enactment of 
these aggressive behaviors are effective in promoting increased rank: Those who 
behave in a bullying, rude, demeaning, and anti-social manner in both experimen-
tal contexts (e.g., Van Kleef et al. 2011) and real-world relationships (e.g., roman-
tic couples, fraternity members) tend to be the more highly ranked and influential 
members of the relationship (Keltner et al. 1998; Kipnis et al. 1976).
</p>
<p>Developmental studies have also demonstrated that aggressive behaviors are ef-
fective in boosting influence in child and adolescent social groups. Preschoolers 
who display coercive and aggressive behaviors (e.g., taking away a toy, insulting, or 
physically aggressing against others) are more effective at acquiring control over a 
valued resource (e.g., a desired toy; Hawley 1999, 2002, 2003). These children are 
also the recipients of greater eye gaze and visual attention from other children&mdash;a 
conceptual indicator of social rank (Abramovitch 1976; Chance 1967; Fiske 1993; 
Hold 1976; La Freniere and Charlesworth 1983; Vaughn and Waters 1981). Further-
more, consistent with our account of aggression as instrumental for acquiring rank 
and influence (Pellegrini and Long 2002; Veenstra et al. 2007; Rodkin and Berger 
2008), not only are adolescents who are most desirous of high rank more aggressive 
(Faris and Ennett 2012), but the display of aggression among adolescents tracks the 
availability of rank-improvement opportunities. Bullying and other aggressive acts 
increase in frequency during children&rsquo;s initial transition from primary to middle 
school, a period when the formation of new social groups provides ample opportu-
nities to establish a new social hierarchy. Aggression subsequently desists after rank 
differences are established (Pellegrini and Bartini 2000), or when aggressors reach 
the pinnacle of the hierarchy and no opportunities for further rank gains are avail-
able (Faris and Felmlee 2011).
</p>
<p>Personality Dominance Given that Dominance is predicated upon threat and 
aggression, personality traits such as dispositional dominance&mdash;defined as a ten-
dency to behave in assertive and forceful ways (though not necessarily aggressively, 
as our concept of Dominance implies; Wiggins 1979)&mdash;are expected to promote 
threat-based relationships with others and consequently result in a high level of 
social influence for those who exhibit the trait.
</p>
<p>Supporting this expectation, a substantial body of evidence indicates that per-
sonality dominance is associated with higher rank and leadership attainment. Meta-
analyses of over 30 studies and 7,000 individuals demonstrate that trait dominance 
is one of the most robust predictors of leader emergence, outperforming a myriad 
of other traits including conscientiousness and intelligence (Judge et al. 2002; Lord 
et al. 1986). Moreover, individuals with dominant personalities acquire influence 
in groups because they are seen as intimidating, as well as competent (although 
they are not, in fact, particularly skilled) by other group members, suggesting that 
trait dominance promotes influence at least partially via perceptions of Dominance 
(Anderson and Kilduff 2009b; Cheng et al. 2013a).

<p>Physical Formidability Paleoanthropological records suggest that aggressive con-
flicts were sufficiently widespread and substantial in human ancestral environments 
to exert a selection pressure (Manson and Wrangham 1991). The ubiquity of ago-
nistic contests in this environment likely favored the emergence of a disposition to 
aggress and intimidate, alongside a decreased willingness to compete with physi-
cally more formidable individuals who engage in aggression and intimidation. As a 
result, physical attributes that either confer or track their carriers&rsquo; fighting prowess 
and ability or willingness to inflict costs in violent contests&mdash;such as physical size 
(e.g., height) and strength, testosterone-linked morphological features such as wider 
facial structure and lower vocal pitch, and spatially expansive nonverbal displays&mdash;
should be associated with increased rank and influence. Considerable evidence 
for associations along these lines exists; here, we review findings demonstrating 
that social rank is systematically linked to each of four classes of formidability-
conveying attributes: physical size and strength, spatially expansive nonverbal dis-
plays, facial structure, and vocal pitch (see also Blaker and van Vugt, Chap. 6, this 
volume).
</p>
<p>Physical Size and Strength Physical size and strength are the primary determinants 
of who prevails in aggressive competitions, across a diverse range of species includ-
ing humans (Archer 1988). Larger and stronger individuals generally prevail in ago-
nistic encounters, and smaller and weaker individuals are likely to sustain injuries 
or risk death during conflicts, so selection should not only favor aggression among 
the large and strong, but also a readiness to submit and defer to these individuals 
among those who are physically smaller and weaker. As a result, size and strength 
are expected to predict rank. A large body of work examining diverse human societ-
ies has supported the first part of this prediction: that larger and stronger individuals 
tend to be more aggressive (e.g., Archer and Thanzami 2007; Felson 1996; Gallup 
et al. 2007; Pellegrini et al. 2007; von Rueden et al. 2008; Sell et al. 2009; Tremblay 
1998). Here, we focus on evidence supporting the second part of this prediction: 
that size and strength predict higher rank and influence.
</p>
<p>Both men and women who are taller in stature consistently occupy a dispropor-
tionate number of leadership positions in organizations, and have a higher income 
(see Judge and Cable 2004). Moreover, the human mind is biased toward intuitively 
associating larger size with greater formidability, power and influence, and leader-
ship capacity (Fessler et al. 2012; Marsh et al. 2009; Schubert et al. 2009; Stulp 
et al. 2013). Observers tend to overestimate the height of powerful others (Dannen-
maier and Thumin 1964; Wilson 1968), and systematically overestimate the height 
of a target individual when feeling powerless, but underestimate this individual&rsquo;s 
height when feeling powerful (Yap et al. 2013). This perceptual bias emerges early 
in life and is seen even among 10-month-old infants, who expect larger agents to 
prevail in conflicts with smaller agents (Thomsen et al. 2011).
</p>
<p>Facial Structure Facial width-to-height ratio (WHR)&mdash;a sexually dimorphic trait 
influenced by testosterone (e.g., Andersson 1994; Lefevre et al. 2013; Verdonck 
et al. 1999)&mdash;has been shown to systematically predict men&rsquo;s fighting ability, physi-
cal prowess, and rates of violence and aggression in both the lab and the real-world </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15
</p>
<p>(Carr&eacute; and McCormick 2008; Carr&eacute; et al. 2009, 2010; Christiansen and Winkler 
1992). From the Dominance account, then, facial WHR should predict perceived 
formidability and resultant rank attainment. Supporting this prediction, men with 
greater facial WHR demonstrate an increased propensity to cheat and exploit others 
(Haselhuhn and Wong 2012; Stirrat and Perrett 2010), and are less likely to die from 
contact violence (Stirrat et al. 2012). Most importantly, wider-faced men are viewed 
as more dominant, forceful, and assertive by others (Alrajih and Ward in-press; 
Valentine et al. in-press), report a heightened sense of power and influence (Hasel-
huhn and Wong 2012), and achieve superior leadership performance, as evidenced 
by the financial earnings of CEO&rsquo;s firms (Wong et al. 2011).
</p>
<p>Vocal Pitch Like facial WHR, lower vocal pitch is associated with higher levels of 
circulating testosterone (Dabbsand Mallinger 1999; Evans et al. 2008; Puts et al. 
2012), and thus may serve as another cue to threat potential and aggression (Mor-
ton and Page 1992). Vocal pitch is thus also expected to promote perceptions of 
formidability and, as a result, increased success in rank competitions. Consistent 
with this expectation, listeners consistently rate deeper voices as conveying greater 
physical size, strength, masculinity, and dominance (e.g., Feinberg et al. 2005; Puts 
et al. 2006, 2007). Moreover, individuals who perceive themselves as physically 
stronger than a rival strategically (but likely unconsciously) lower their voices in 
competitive contexts, whereas those who view themselves as weaker tend to raise 
their pitch (Puts et al. 2006). Finally, in studies directly linking vocal pitch to suc-
cess in rank attainment, lower pitched political candidates were found to receive 
more votes than higher-pitched candidates (Anderson and Klofstad 2012; Klofstad 
et al. 2012; Tigue et al. 2012), and to manage larger companies and have higher 
income (Mayew et al. 2013). In addition, participants instructed to deepen their 
pitch report a greater subjective sense of power (Stel et al. 2012), and individuals 
in a social interaction who spontaneously lower their pitch over the course of the 
interaction are perceived as higher in Dominance, and attain greater social influence 
as a result (Cheng et al., 2013d).
</p>
<p>Spatially Expansive Nonverbal Displays Spatially expansive nonverbal postural 
displays increase one&rsquo;s apparent size, which should also convey formidability 
and thus promote high rank through the Dominance pathway (see also Hall et al. 
Chap. 15, this volume). Consistent with prediction, numerous studies have dem-
onstrated that spatially expansive, open postures&mdash;such as pride displays and open 
arm and leg gestures&mdash;not only increase the perceived influence and rank of their 
displayers across cultures (Carney et al. 2005; Marsh et al. 2009; Shariff and Tracy 
2009; Tracy and Matsumoto 2008), but also tend to be spontaneously adopted by 
powerful leaders or winners of physical fights (Tracy and Matsumoto 2008; for 
a review, see Hall et al. 2005). In contrast, losers of such battles, and followers, 
tend to adopt complementary constricting postures, which signal their deference 
and subordination (Tiedens and Fragale 2003; Weisfeld and Beresford 1982). Fur-
thermore, in addition to promoting rank by increasing perceived formidability, 
expansive postures also activate rank-related cognitions and hormones, which in 
turn motivate rank-seeking behaviors. For example, adopting expanded postures

</p>
<p>induces subjective feelings of power and control (Huang et al. 2011; Riskind and 
Gotay 1982; Tiedens and Fragale 2003) and associated increases in testosterone 
and decreases in cortisol (Carney et al. 2010)&mdash;a unique neuroendocrine profile 
that underpins dominance and rank-seeking behaviors (Mehta and Josephs 2010).
</p>
<p>In summary, findings from these diverse programs of research converge to sup-
port a number of specific predictions that emerge from the Dominance account 
of social rank. Together, these findings underscore the formidability-enhancing as-
pect of certain attributes and traits that, by virtue of facilitating individuals&rsquo; ability 
to wield dominance, are fundamentally linked to attaining and maintaining high 
rank. By recognizing the centrality of threat and coercion in human life, particularly 
in shaping patterns of influence and rank (alongside admiration and respect), the 
Dominance-Prestige Account thus allows us to explain and unite these previously 
disconnected lines of research.
</p>
<p>Prestige Promotes Social Rank
</p>
<p>Paralleling the findings reviewed above, a large body of evidence suggests that many 
of the narrower behaviors and psychological processes that underpin the attainment 
of respect and admiration (i.e., Prestige) also lead to increased rank and influence in 
humans. Here, we review these prior findings and focus on two major classes of traits 
and attributes that predict social influence via freely conferred deference: (a) the 
demonstration of locally valued skills and expertise and (b) altruism and generosity.
</p>
<p>Locally Valued Skills and Expertise Imitating or learning from highly skilled 
individuals provides significant advantages over learning from less skilled others 
(Henrich and Gil-White 2001), making it adaptive for learners to effectively discrim-
inate and mentally rank potential models according to their skills and expertise, and 
selectively determine whom to observe and imitate on that basis. Most importantly, 
learners should demonstrate a preference to imitate highly ranked models, and pay 
deference to these individuals in exchange for proximity and access to information. 
As a result, demonstrated expertise should be associated with higher social rank.
</p>
<p>Supporting this prediction, a large body of research from across the social scienc-
es has documented links between perceived competence in locally valued domains 
and rank attainment. Technical and task-relevant skills and expertise are among 
the most frequently nominated qualities important to leadership (Stogdill 1974), 
and their possessors generally emerge as most influential members of task-focused 
groups (Anderson and Kilduff 2009a; Bottger 1984; Laughlin et al. 1975; Littlepage 
et al. 1995; Miner 1984; Palmer 1962). Moreover, meta-analyses reveal that intelli-
gence&mdash;a trait that presumably gives rise to diverse skills and abilities emphasized in 
modern societies&mdash;consistently predicts leadership emergence (Lord et al. 1986). In 
addition, individuals who view themselves as competent and capable prefer higher 
ranks and display greater rank-seeking behavior, whereas those who perceive them-
selves as less competent generally prefer lower ranks (Anderson et al. 2012b).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17
</p>
<p>The ethnographic record also supplies numerous examples of the association be-
tween expertise and rank. Hunting skill, in particular, seems to be a primary means 
to both respect and societal influence in many foraging, horticultural, and pasto-
ral societies (Gurven and von Rueden 2006; Kelly 1995; Wiessner 1996). Among 
the Kuna, an indigenous island-living population that hunts and plants crops on 
Panama&rsquo;s Caribbean coast, each man keeps a lifetime record of tapir kills. Men 
with the most tapir kills receive respect and exert substantial influence over others 
(Ventocilla et al. 1995). Among the Meriam, a Melanesian people of Torres Strait, 
Australia, success in turtle hunting&mdash;an extremely dangerous and financially costly 
activity that requires knowledge about turtle resting and feeding patterns&mdash;confers 
prestige, including from respected village elders who selectively support the opin-
ions of younger skilled hunters in public meetings or private disputes (Smith and 
Bird 2000). Among the Western Apache, all men actively participate in hunting but 
only good hunters are accorded the highest prestige (Buskirk 1986). Beyond hunt-
ing, expertise in other valued domains&mdash;such as ethnomedicinal knowledge, story-
telling, healing or supernatural knowledge, combat, farming and herding skills&mdash;are 
also associated with respect and influence in small-scale societies (see von Rueden, 
Chap. 9, this volume).
</p>
<p>Importantly, Prestige is largely accorded on the basis of perceived, rather than 
actual, competence and expertise, which explains why Prestige and rank allocation 
tend to be strongly influenced by competence cues. The detection of true com-
petence is often difficult, especially in circumstances that are noisy (i.e., models 
often fail before succeeding at difficult tasks), costly (i.e., careful observation over 
multiple occasions is needed), and offer limited information (i.e., it is not always 
obvious how competence should be judged; Minson et al. 2011). Learners therefore 
come to rely on superficial cues and symbols of competence and success, despite an 
often imperfect link between these cues and actual skill. For example, assessments 
of competence are often based on observable cues of confidence, such as degree 
of certainty expressed and amount of talking (Anderson and Kilduff 2009b; Lit-
tlepage et al. 1995), and nonverbal displays of pride (Steckler and Tracy, Chap. 10, 
this volume). Individuals incentivized to correctly answer trivia questions tend to 
imitate the answers of models displaying pride, regardless of these models&rsquo; actual 
knowledge (Martens and Tracy 2013), likely due to the expression&rsquo;s function as a 
cross-cultural signal of high rank (Tracy et al. 2013). Similarly, hunter-gatherers 
gauge Prestige from signs of success such as wealth, ornamentation, and larger 
yams (Kaberry 1941; Malinowski 1922). Another well-documented cue is age, 
which indicates a lifetime of experience and accumulated skills and knowledge; the 
Samai, an indigenous Malaysian population, for example, seek out elders for their 
opinions and grant them disproportional influence over the society, despite their 
lack of power or authority to enforce decisions (Dentan 1979).
</p>
<p>Research on children&rsquo;s learning preferences indicate a similar reliance on Pres-
tige-related cues, suggesting that these biases are rapidly acquired in development, 
or may be innate, in the sense of reliably emerging across diverse environmental 
variations. Children as young as two years old prefer to learn from models who dis-
play confidence, compared to those who appear uncertain (Birch et al. 2009; Jaswal 
</p>
<p>1 Toward a Unified Science of Hierarchy</p>
<p/>

<p>18 J. T. Cheng and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>and Malone 2007; Rakoczy et al. 2009; Sabbagh and Baldwin 2001). Similarly, 
3- and 4-year-old children make inferences of Prestige on the basis of bystanders&rsquo; 
visual attention to potential models (a Prestige cue), and subsequently choose to 
learn from the most apparently Prestigious models (Chudek et al. 2012).
</p>
<p>The appeal of confidence as a marker of skill and knowledge is so potent that 
adults demonstrate a propensity to confer Prestige and deference to overconfident 
individuals, whose metacognitive assessment of their ability exceeds their actual 
performance; such individuals consistently attain higher rank than their skills merit 
(Anderson et al. 2012a). This bias, toward granting influence to group members 
who may not in fact deserve it, is similar to that described by status characteristics 
theory (Berger and Conner 1969; Driskell 1982; Driskell and Mullen 1990; Webster 
and Driskell 1978), which argues that rank differentiation in newly formed groups 
is partly influenced by members&rsquo; personal characteristics&mdash;such as race, age, sex, 
and occupation. In this view, these characteristics have become stereotypically (if 
often incorrectly) associated with perceived task competence (see also North and 
Fiske, Chap. 12, this volume). These stereotypical expectations are imported into 
new and pre-existing group contexts, and shape expectations of relative skill and 
rank allocation (for a review, see Berger et al. 1980).
</p>
<p>Altruism and Generosity The Prestige Account predicts that altruism and generos-
ity, when coupled with competence in valued domains, should promote Prestige 
and social rank. Apart from marking excellence in the valued domain of moral-
ity, these pro-social behaviors&mdash;which typically benefit the group at a cost to the 
self&mdash;provide another means of conveying and widely broadcasting the generous 
individual&rsquo;s skills and ability to accrue valuable resources (i.e., Prestige). Large 
charitable donations, for example, serve as signals of the donor&rsquo;s wealth (Cheng 
and Tracy 2013). Such costly advertisements attract more learners and further ele-
vate the Prestige of the displayer. In addition, social learners&rsquo; tendency to imitate 
skilled individuals creates an extra incentive for the Prestigious to act prosocially. 
If a prestigious individual behaves prosocially (e.g., contributes to the group) others 
are likely to follow suit, thereby increasing the Prestigious individual&rsquo;s payoff. In 
contrast, if a prestigious individual defects, others are likely to defect, reducing any 
potential free-riding benefits for the Prestigious. In contrast, Dominants&rsquo; behaviors 
are not copied, so any pro-social behaviors they display will not only mitigate their 
ability to evoke fear, but also fail to result in increased group-wide prosociality 
(Henrich 2005).
</p>
<p>A large body of evidence from psychology, sociology, anthropology, and behav-
ioral economics supports an association between altruism, generosity, and social 
rank. For example, groups tend to elect the most altruistic members as leaders (Hardy 
and van Vugt 2006; Milinski et al. 2002), and confer them with greater respect, ad-
miration, as well as influence (Willer 2009). When rank-seeking motives are made 
salient, individuals express an increased desire for environmentally friendly yet 
costly products&mdash;but only when their purchase of these products is made publicly 
known to others, suggesting that certain altruistic acts are motivated by reputational 
concerns (Griskevicius et al. 2010; see Kafashan et al., Chap. 7, this volume). In-
deed, the anthropological literature documents cross-cultural links between costly </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19
</p>
<p>displays of altruism and reputational gains. For example, in a Melanesian tribe the 
ability to share turtle meat&mdash;a highly prized commodity&mdash;signals the high quality 
(of the sharer), because turtle hunting is a time-consuming activity which requires 
substantial knowledge and skill (Smith and Bird 2000). Among the Semai, the most 
generous men are also the most popular and sought out for advice (Dentan 1979). 
In Lamalera, a sea-hunting village in Indonesia, those who hold official leadership 
positions tend to be the most excessive sharers (Nolin 2012; for more ethnographic 
accounts, see Hardy and van Vugt 2006).
</p>
<p>In summary, the Prestige account&mdash;which was developed from theoretical mod-
els of cultural evolution and social learning, and in isolation from these empirical 
research efforts&mdash;provides an explanatory account for these prior findings demon-
strating the importance of skill, talent, altruism, and generosity to rank attainment. 
The key insight that emerges from our empirically grounded theoretical approach is 
that humans allocate social rank on the basis of respect and admiration, in addition 
to force and coercion.
</p>
<p>Concluding Remarks
</p>
<p>Theoretical and empirical research programs from across the social sciences are 
converging to suggest that Dominance and Prestige form the dual foundations of 
human hierarchical relationships. Unlike prior psychological theories that specify 
proximate explanations for specific findings (e.g., competent individuals emerge as 
leaders because group members view them as best able to contribute to group func-
tioning), the Dominance-Prestige Account provides a broader ultimate explanation 
for all of these findings, by proposing that human hierarchies are the product of 
our species&rsquo; evolved tendency to submit to those who wield force and intimidation, 
and to follow and learn from those who garner respect and admiration. In this view, 
these two systems of rank allocation are underpinned by distinct psychological pro-
cesses, behaviors, and neurochemistry which were selected for distinct evolutionary 
pressures.
</p>
<p>More generally, we argue that this approach is not only a useful framework for 
organizing and understanding the extensive and rapidly emerging body of research 
on social rank dynamics, but also unifies these efforts into a single cumulative re-
search program. As we have demonstrated, the Dominance-Prestige framework of-
fers a unified explanation for why people who are coercive and aggressive, high in 
personality dominance, tall or strong, have wide faces and deep voices, and assume 
spatially expansive postures, tend to rise to the top of hierarchies; and why other 
highly-ranked individuals gain influence by instead demonstrating skills, expertise, 
and generosity. These diverse rank-related phenomena are best understood as phe-
notypic manifestations of one of two fundamental rank processes. Importantly, al-
though not all predictions sketched above are unique to this account&mdash;in fact, other 
proximate explanations have been generated for each isolated finding&mdash;collectively 
they cannot be better explained by any competing model.

<p>Prestige, Culture, and Cultural Transmission
</p>
<p>Because these terms will be used throughout this chapter, it will be useful to begin 
with some of their complexities and simplifications.
</p>
<p>What is &ldquo;Prestige&rdquo;?
</p>
<p>Human beings hierarchize, defined as the tendency for social interaction to gener-
ate a social hierarchy. Hierarchies are usually conceptualized (depending on the 
language) either as composed of individuals who are &ldquo;higher/lower than&rdquo; or &ldquo;in 
front of/behind&rdquo; others. Thus, in the 1960s, in a study of self-esteem, I could show 
Hausa-speaking farmers in northern Nigeria a sheet of paper with a horizontal line 
on it and tell them that the Emir was at one end and a leper at the other. They 
immediately understood and, given a pencil, had no difficulty marking their own 
position (Barkow 1973). Hausa farmers, being human, hierarchize. In English, we 
have a rich vocabulary for describing relative standing (a term which itself implies 
in front of or behind) and status or rank. A commonly used term in discussion of 
relative standing is &ldquo;prestige,&rdquo; defined by Barkow (1989, p. 203) as &ldquo;respect and 
approbation accorded to one by others.&rdquo; Henrich and Gil-White (2001) add &ldquo;freely 
conferred&rdquo; to this definition, but the addition brings the difficult philosophical is-
sue of &ldquo;free will&rdquo; to a discussion already sufficiently complex. Can respect and 
approbation be other than freely conferred? &ldquo;Coerced prestige&rdquo; is apparently an 
oxymoron. Or is it?
</p>
<p>What do we make of the Stockholm syndrome, in which hostages come to re-
spect, sympathize with, and even bond with their captors so that the fear and hatred 
initially &ldquo;freely accorded&rdquo; becomes freely accorded prestige? Human relationships </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>30 J. H. Barkow
</p>
<p>are characterized by complexity and ambivalence. Respect and approval may mask 
or even include, for example, fear, sexual attraction, or envy. The initial emotion 
attached to a relationship is not necessarily permanent, and we may come to respect 
and regard as prestigious individuals whom we previously had feared or even de-
spised, or vice versa. As celebrities and lovers know, we are a fickle species.1 Be 
that as it may, &ldquo;prestige&rdquo; may only be one component in a shifting mix of sentiments 
involving multiple and likely complex psychological mechanisms, as exemplified 
by the Stockholm syndrome.
</p>
<p>Hierarchical relationships in particular tend to include much ambivalence&mdash;one 
frequently both respects and fears one&rsquo;s superior, and often there is little enough of 
respect. For example, in situations in which hierarchy is formal&mdash;the boss in a work 
environment, for example&mdash;there is often a conflict between the amount of prestige 
attached to the position and the extent to which the individual occupying the posi-
tion is capable of eliciting respect/prestige from the &ldquo;underlings.&rdquo; In simple terms, 
one&rsquo;s boss may lack charisma, defined as the ability to nonverbally and paralinguis-
tically win respect from others (Barkow 1989). Charismatic individuals are readily 
identifiable by their ability to (apparently) automatically draw positive attention 
from others. Promotion and political success, especially in societies in which status 
is more achieved than ascribed, may depend on personal charisma, but may also be 
due to accident of birth or doing well on civil service examinations. Thus, it is not 
uncommon to have little respect for one&rsquo;s formal superior: Formal rank is not pres-
tige. (The US Army deliberately seeks to work around this problem. As Col. George 
E. Reed [2004, p. 68] writes, &ldquo;The Army inculcates an attitude that one must respect 
the rank, even if one does not respect the person.&rdquo;)
</p>
<p>Culture
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Culture&rdquo; has any number of definitions and has even been contested within its 
originating discipline, anthropology (Aunger 2000). Here is what culture means, 
for present purposes: All species adapt to environment or go extinct. Over the long 
term, that adaptation is genetic&mdash;species evolve. Over the short term, however, 
members of a species may adapt to environment through behavioral changes some 
of which are learned from conspecifics, that is, they are products of social learning. 
In our own species, groups over time very often accumulate information of vary-
ing degrees of utility. When this learned information is considered as a socially 
</p>
<p>1 Barkow (1978) has argued that the Stockholm syndrome reflects the inappropriate triggering 
of mechanisms that evolved to help young children internalize norms crucial for survival. The 
triggering takes place because the extraordinary amount of power the kidnappers have over their 
captives is comparable to the power parents have over young children. The triggered mechanisms 
cause the victims to sympathize with, respect, and even (at times) admire their captors and to 
believe in their cause. Fear is replaced by or at least joined with admiration that may be construed 
as &ldquo;freely conferred&rdquo; because it can endure even after captivity ends. The problem here is that 
&ldquo;freely conferred&rdquo; is a simplistic folk concept that is incompatible with modern understanding of 
the complexities of human psychology.</p>

<p>312 Prestige and the Ongoing Process of Culture Revision
</p>
<p> transmitted information pool associated with a particular population or populations, 
we can speak of a culture. A culture&rsquo;s population(s) may be geographically local-
ized or distributed over noncontiguous geographic areas. Any particular informa-
tional item may occur in multiple cultures, resulting in what is often substantial 
cross-cultural overlap. A society is an organized collectivity of people, a culture is 
an information pool whose information is lodged in the brains of the individuals 
who participate in it. Anglophone Canada and the USA are distinct societies whose 
cultural information pools largely (but certainly not entirely) overlap. A society may 
include populations with different cultures, provided these cultures share rules for 
social and political organization (otherwise the society will be politically unstable).
</p>
<p>Culture Is Not Necessarily Adaptive
</p>
<p>Our own species has a hypertrophied reliance on culture. This extreme reliance is 
surprising because unfiltered, unedited pools of cultural information accumulate 
maladaptive items while missing out on new, potentially adaptive ones (Barkow 
1989; Barkow et al. 2001, 2012; Boyd and Richerson 1985; Enquist and Ghirlanda 
2007; Richerson and Boyd 2004). Barkow (1989, pp. 296&ndash;297) presents a general 
discussion of maladaptive cultural traits that (with possibly excessive alliteration) 
situates the problem of cultural misinformation in the context of four processes: (1) 
Environments alter. Cultural information that once was adaptive may have outlived 
its usefulness. For example, efforts may continue to grow a particular crop even 
after climate change or a new plant disease has rendered the cultivar unsuitable 
for the area. Similarly, successful fishing techniques may lead to overfishing and 
the collapse of the fishery so that the cultural fishing knowledge becomes inef-
fective. (2) Expenses emerge. Moving from hunting&ndash;gathering to farming, for ex-
ample, may result in a larger but much less varied food supply, causing nutritional 
deficiency diseases. Thus, our hunting&ndash;gathering ancestors probably never suffered 
from scurvy (vitamin C deficiency), unlike some cultivators. (3) Errors accumulate. 
Irrelevant or false information can enter the culture. Perhaps young people fail to 
learn a technique accurately or misunderstand a belief and then teach the error to 
the next generation, or perhaps the few individuals holding certain information die 
before others have learned it from them. Erroneous information may or may not be 
corrected: Generations of young people in North America were taught that toma-
toes, which belong to the same family (Solanaceaea) as does Belladonna or &ldquo;deadly 
nightshade,&rdquo; are poisonous. (4) Elites appropriate. High-status groups may encour-
age beliefs in their own interest. In medieval Christianity, the poor were taught that 
obedience to authority was a virtue and that they would be rewarded after death. 
Among the Kimam-Papuans of South Irian Jaya (described by Serpenti [1984]), 
young men were taught by their elders that sexual contact with women was ritually 
very dangerous, permitting the older men to monopolize the young women (Barkow 
1989, pp. 361&ndash;362). Culture is not just an information pool automatically &ldquo;transmit-
ted&rdquo; by &ldquo;enculturation&rdquo; or &ldquo;socialization,&rdquo; as social scientists once imagined: it is an </p>
<p/>

<p>32 J. H. Barkow
</p>
<p>arena for informational conflict, filled with error and missed ecological opportuni-
ties. It must constantly be revised, filtered, and edited. As will be shortly discussed, 
preferential attention to the prestigious can help edit out erroneous information 
when that prestige is based on real-world success; but it can also &ldquo;transmit&rdquo; irrel-
evant practices while affording an opportunity for the prestigious to spread cultural 
information that is in their own interest but not necessarily that of others.
</p>
<p>The Need for Cultural Revision
</p>
<p>Successful cultures are those that, at least in part, can rid themselves of maladaptive 
information. Barkow (1989) refers to this process as &ldquo;culture revision&rdquo; or &ldquo;filter-
ing,&rdquo; and more recently (Barkow et al. 2012, 2013) as &ldquo;culture editing.&rdquo; Enquist and 
Ghirlanda (2007) speak of &ldquo;adaptive filtering&rdquo; for discarding maladaptive informa-
tion while accepting the adaptive. Revision is always highly problematic and of 
limited accuracy. This is in part because the same mechanisms may be responsible 
both for cultural &ldquo;transmission&rdquo; and for editing. For example, it has been argued 
that, if one assumes that high-status (prestigious) people are doing at least some 
things right, preferentially attending to and learning from them may increase useful 
practices at the expense of less effective techniques (Barkow 1989, p. 312; Barkow 
et al. 2001, pp. 138&ndash;139; Boyd and Richerson 1985; Henrich and Gil-White 2001; 
Richerson and Boyd 2004), within a given cultural information pool. (Members 
of the gene-culture coevolution school of thought usually refer to this as &ldquo;prestige 
bias,&rdquo; following the practice of Boyd and Richerson (1985)). As will be discussed 
shortly, preferential learning from the high-in-status may be as likely to introduce 
into a culture adaptively neutral/maladaptive traits as useful information. This point 
is readily apparent when we consider what, in contemporary Western society, young 
people are learning from our highly prestigious celebrity-entertainers and sports 
figures. (This topic, too, will be revisited at greater length below.)
</p>
<p>The editing of cultural information is a highly uncertain process. Ethnographic 
records exaggerate the effectiveness of cultural knowledge because ethnographies 
can be written only for societies that are at least somewhat successful, that is, so-
cieties that still exist, or did until very recently: As with animal species, the vast 
majority of earlier cultures and societies are now extinct, with the failure of cul-
tural editing probably having contributed, in many cases, to that extinction. But 
the ethnographic record suggests that even successful cultures are studded with 
misinformation. It could not be otherwise. For example, how does a parent dis-
tinguish a child&rsquo;s ill health caused by a heavy parasite load from ill health due to 
poor nutritional practices (Barkow et al. 2001)? Informational domains in which 
corrective feedback is lacking tend to be populated with ineffective and even mal-
adaptive beliefs and practices (e.g., the formerly widespread practice of denying 
the infant the colostrum [Barkow and Hallett 1989]). The editing and filtering of 
cultural information is as hit-or-miss a process as it is essential to human survival 
and reproduction. As with other evolutionary processes, there is no requirement for </p>

</p>
<p>perfection in cultural editing, only that it be more effective than the cultural editing 
occurring in rival societies.
</p>
<p>Michael Chance, Attention, and Fear  
</p>
<p>and Non-Fear-Based Social Hierarchies
</p>
<p>Cultural transmission and revision begin and end with social learning, and social 
learning begins with attention. The primatologist/ethologist Michael Chance and 
his collaborators (Chance 1967, 1988; Chance and Jolly 1970; Chance and Larsen 
1976) argued that primate social hierarchy is not a simple matter of dominance (fear-
based) relationships but, rather, is a structure of social attention: the higher ranking 
receive preferential attention from the lower in status. The nature of the social hier-
archy depended on the type of attention involved. For Chance, primate &ldquo;hedonic&rdquo; 
attention contrasted with &ldquo;agonistic&rdquo; or threat/danger attention and were associated 
with hedonic and agonistic hierarchies, respectively. Chimpanzees tended to have 
hedonic attention, he (and some of his collaborators) argued, while the social hier-
archies of the baboon-macaque group were agonistic. Chance, who for many years 
studied macaque monkeys at his laboratory at the University of Birmingham (UK), 
of course understood that agonistic elements were common in hedonic hierarchies 
and hedonic elements in agonism-based rank systems. For example, he described 
chimpanzee subordinates fleeing from a threatening higher-ranked individual only 
to return to the same individual for a reassuring hug. However, Chance believed 
that, in any one species, either hedonic or agonistic relationships would be pre-
dominant, and that the different kinds of relationship and attention led to different 
types of learning. Agonistic relationships were associated with fear-based learning, 
learning about how to avoid punishment. Hedonic relationships were associated 
with unobstructed channels of communication in which a very broad range of infor-
mation could be conveyed. In our own species, both hedonic and agonistic attention 
and social hierarchy could exist.
</p>
<p>It is not clear exactly what &ldquo;hedonic&rdquo; means, other than signaling the occurrence 
of hugs, embraces, and mutual grooming; &ldquo;agonistic,&rdquo; however, clearly refers to 
displays of threat on the part of one individual and a fearful response on the part 
of the other. It is now well-established that fear learning is quite different, even at 
a neurological level, from other than kinds of learning (e.g., &Ouml;hman and Mineka 
2001; Sigurdsson et al. 2007); neuroscientists even speak of a &ldquo;fear module&rdquo; asso-
ciated with the amygdala that operates with fear-associated learning. It is probably 
best to think of Chance&rsquo;s dichotomy in terms of fear-based attention versus non-
fear-based attention. Current discussions of this fear versus non-fear dichotomy in 
systems of social rank tend to cite not Chance but the overlapping ideas of Henrich 
and Gil-White (2001).2 Like Chance, they argue for two different kinds of hierarchi-
</p>
<p>2 While these authors themselves do not cite Chance directly they do cite Barkow (1975), who 
summarizes Chance&rsquo;s ideas, and they do appear&mdash;in my opinion&mdash;to have been influenced by his 
thinking.</p>
<p/>

<p>34 J. H. Barkow
</p>
<p>cal relationships, their labels being &ldquo;prestige&rdquo; and &ldquo;dominance.&rdquo; The latter appears 
to be similar to Chance&rsquo;s &ldquo;agonistic&rdquo; mode. Henrich and Gil-White argue that high 
rank (i.e., priority of access to resources, influence, etc.) is a direct result of greater 
skill or prestige, and it is by virtue of using better techniques that these individuals 
have gained their rank.
</p>
<p>Henrich and Gil-White believe that prestige-linked learning is the product of 
selection for cultural transmission (a topic not explicitly discussed by Chance, who 
does, however, write extensively about social learning). Their position overlaps 
with that of Barkow (1989, p. 312, Barkow et al. 2001, pp. 138&ndash;139), who argues 
that preferential attention to the prestigious tends to revise culture by editing out in-
effective knowledge in favor of practices that work. Henrich and Gil-White (2001) 
and Barkow (Barkow 1989; Barkow et al. 2001) are certainly at least in part cor-
rect&mdash;Chance&rsquo;s brilliant insight into primate preferential attention to and learning 
from the high-in-status helps to explain how we could have evolved so strong a 
dependence on culture without its advantages being wiped out by the accumulation 
of maladaptive &ldquo;information.&rdquo; There is now experimental research establishing that 
we do learn preferentially from the high-in-status and/or successful (Atkisson et al. 
2012) and that, as Chance argued, we also attend to them preferentially (Cheng 
et al. 2013). We are also more likely to imitate those who nonverbally communicate 
&ldquo;pride&rdquo; than from those who do not (Martens and Tracy 2012). Presumably, prefer-
ential attention to the high-in-status, a part of primate social hierarchy, served as an 
exaptation3 for culture-filtering social learning (though we have no way of knowing 
if the chimpanzee and humans share preferential learning from the high in rank and 
success as a result of common ancestry [parallel evolution] or whether they inde-
pendently evolved the trait [convergent evolution]).
</p>
<p>Prestige, Sexual Selection, and Cooperation
</p>
<p>Human societies have numerous systems of non-agonistic, prestige-related rank, all 
based on different sets of symbolic criteria. A symbol is something that stands for 
something else, and, in this case, the &ldquo;something else&rdquo; is a criterion for assessing 
relative standing. Cultures provide multiple sets of such symbolic criteria; partici-
pants in a particular culture may evaluate themselves and others in terms of, for ex-
ample, various kinds of skills in production and entertainment, membership in a kin 
or other type of hereditary network, speaking ability, sexual attractiveness, the num-
ber of their healthy children and grandchildren, or the degree of prestige accorded 
to those children and grandchildren4. Individuals tend to weigh competing criteria 
sets in the service of their own self-esteem: The avid footballer &ldquo;knows&rdquo; that that 
</p>
<p>3 &ldquo;Exaptation&rdquo; refers to the fact that the selection pressures which originated a trait may subse-
quently be replaced by others, so that the trait changes in form and function.
4 For example, among some groups the stereotype exists of the proud parent who speaks not of 
&ldquo;my son/daughter&rdquo; but of &ldquo;my son/daughter the doctor,&rdquo; the profession of physician being consid-
ered highly prestigious.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>352 Prestige and the Ongoing Process of Culture Revision
</p>
<p>sport outranks basketball, the owner of a Maserati and the self-consciously &ldquo;green&rdquo; 
bicycle owner may have very different ideas about their relative standing. Some 
sets of criteria may be age and gender specific, so that, pre-teens and teenagers may 
compete in terms of quite different criteria, and, depending on the culture, success 
among women may be evaluated in ways distinct from that of success among men.
</p>
<p>Many sets of prestige evaluation criteria can be placed along a situational versus 
overweaning axis. At the overweaning extreme are criteria that imply that prestige 
is inherent in the individual and always relevant regardless of circumstances, at 
the situational end are prestige criteria that apply only under very specific circum-
stances. For example, prestige as a cook is mostly situational, as when my guests 
thank me for the excellent meal I have served them. In contrast, criteria for the rank 
of monarch have to do with ancestry; being the monarch is always overweaning 
and never situational. Prestige as a physician is somewhere between these two, the 
doctor ranks high in the confines of the hospital but not in the police station when 
accused of a serious crime. In contrast to the multitude of ways in which members 
of our own species can attract prestige, nonhuman primate societies appear to have 
only one system of rank, producing a single social hierarchy (though it would not 
be surprising if primatologists found some degree of nonagonistic situational rank, 
particularly among the anthropoid apes). Presumably, our distant ancestors, too, had 
essentially a single hierarchy. How then did we move from primate social hierarchy 
to human multiple systems of symbolic rank?
</p>
<p>Barkow (1989, p. 187) answers this question in terms of sexual selection: &ldquo;Selec-
tion would have favored females who preferred not just males with high agonistic 
rank but [also] males with high investment ability. It would also have favored males 
who, finding themselves unsuccessful in competing in agonistic dominance, instead 
emphasized the procurement of resources. An alternative path to reproductive suc-
cess was now opened for males, one emphasizing not agonistic competition but 
competition for resources and in the tool skills associated with resource competi-
tion&hellip; .&rdquo; To this, it should be added that selection equally would have favored males 
who chose to mate with females who exhibited greater skill in resource acquisition 
and tool skills. Females would, therefore, have been selected to compete in the 
ability to procure resources (and, possibly, in mothering skills). Thus, for both fe-
males and males, there would have been competition not just for agonistic rank but 
for rank (and therefore, reputation) in terms of skills and abilities: symbolic rank, 
prestige. The capacity for culture no doubt was the evolutionary product of mul-
tiple sets of selection pressures that varied over time, and no single process should 
ever be considered in isolation; in the context of these multiple selection pressures, 
however, &ldquo;primate agonistic dominance would have gradually broadened into the 
modern multiple-criteria sets of human prestige&rdquo; (Barkow 1989, p. 187).
</p>
<p>Once hominins began to compete in areas other than agonistic dominance, the 
way was opened to competition in numerous other domains. Geoffrey Miller (Miller 
1998, 2000a, b) argues that much of human psychology&mdash;a sense of humor, art, mu-
sic, verbal skill, indeed, almost any skill domain&mdash;are products of sexual selection. 
They are all reliable indicators of &ldquo;good genes,&rdquo; of genetic fitness, argues Miller. 
Thus, we find, in human societies, what appears to be an incredible number of cul-</p>

</p>
<p>turally varying ways of competing, unified because all involve competition with a 
standard of excellence. Where Barkow (1989) focuses on sexual selection for skills 
in resource acquisition, Miller&rsquo;s focus is much broader and emphasizes the self-
accelerating, positive feedback process of runaway sexual selection. Combining 
the two approaches presents a reasonable account of how it is that human societies 
are today typified by multiple sets of criteria for the allocation of prestige, each set 
defining an arena for competition and an identity. (To get prestige as a chef I must 
compete with other chefs in terms of prestige criteria associated with cooking, to 
get prestige as a philanthropist I must compete with other philanthropists in terms 
of a set of criteria for prestige allocation specific to philanthropists, and so forth.)
</p>
<p>Without symbolic prestige, it is difficult to see how complex societies could have 
developed. Symbolic prestige permits individuals to be relatively comfortable with 
their lot in life because their arena of competition is sharply curtailed: As a farmer, 
I need not directly compete for status with the blacksmith or the aristocrat, just 
with other farmers. While prestige doubtless plays a role in filtering maladaptive 
information from culture, it is the sine qua non of complex society. Symbolic pres-
tige curtails status competition and thus enables social organization above the level 
of the troop of nonhuman primates. Only with the relative encapsulation of social 
strata made possible by symbolic prestige could complex societies have evolved. 
However, symbolic prestige potentially leads to more social competition for relative 
standing within each stratum of society, even if it entails less competition among 
strata. It is the latter that is more likely to produce social disintegration, after all. As 
will shortly be argued, symbolic prestige also promotes human cooperation.
</p>
<p>No matter how complex the society and no matter how many the different sets 
of criteria for prestige allocation available, agonism lurks in our social hierarchies 
(Barkow et al. 2012). Challenging another&rsquo;s prestige can spark anger and an impulse 
towards violence (suppressed, one hopes). Control over resources and the capacity 
for physical violence seem to be the bottom line of human social hierarchy. When 
societies disintegrate, or when colonial conquest destroys existing sets of prestige 
criteria, these remain. The news media may refer to the new leaders as &ldquo;warlords&rdquo; 
or &ldquo;gang leaders,&rdquo; but it is these figures, who control resources and violence, who 
become the respected, the prestigious, the people from whom children learn. The 
Stockholm syndrome, discussed previously, may reflect a primordial link between 
power/resource control on the one hand and respect and prestige on the other. From 
an evolutionary perspective, of course, none of this is surprising: We did not evolve 
in the psychologist&rsquo;s laboratory where clever experimental design may permit the 
separation of the agonistic vs. non-agonistic aspects of our relationship to another, 
we evolved in situations in which the neurophysiological bases of our relationship 
behavior were always in flux, and agonism was and is our last resort when all other 
efforts for us to maintain our relative standing fail. Experimental findings in psy-
chology are of immense importance but need to be understood in the context both 
of ordinary life and of human evolution.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>372 Prestige and the Ongoing Process of Culture Revision
</p>
<p>Cooperation
</p>
<p>Non-agonistic (&ldquo;hedonic,&rdquo; &ldquo;prestige&rdquo;) attention facilitates cooperation. Larsen 
(1976, p. 263) explains how hedonic attention permits individuals to spend more 
time learning from and cooperating with one another: &ldquo;Increased reliance on a 
hedonic mode of interaction enhances cooperative behavior and social learning as 
actors are able to move easily in close contact and jointly explore and manipulate 
the environment. The overall survival value of a net increase in the time spent on 
nonsocial attention paying is fairly obvious as considerably more time can be spent 
on initiating environmental manipulation.&rdquo; The time saved can also be spent in 
cooperative resource-accrual endeavors such as gathering, hunting, and farming, as 
well as in competing with rival groups or coalitions.
</p>
<p>The development of multiple sets of symbolic criteria for the allocation of pres-
tige further promotes cooperation because it mutes competition. This is because 
the evolution of diverse prestige allocation criteria permitted individuals to believe 
themselves to be as high or higher in prestige than many of those around them. We 
see this often among friends, in our own society: I recognize that you make more 
money than I do but I know that I am superior to you because of my many volunteer 
activities. You may have more expertise in cuisine than I do, but my body is in better 
physical shape. You may beat me in tennis but I am better-looking, or have the more 
desirable spouse, or whatever. If there is no actual sphere in which I am your supe-
rior then I can always resort to believing that I am morally superior to you (Barkow 
1989). So long as we do not speak of these things we may be friends or at least able 
to cooperate with one another. As early hominins became increasingly able to evalu-
ate relative standing symbolically, cooperation in hunting, gathering, tool-making 
and sharing, and defense/offense against other bands would have increased. Thus, 
prestige likely played a role not just in filtering mistaken information from culture 
but also in promoting cooperation among individuals.
</p>
<p>Prestige and Strategic Cultural Learning
</p>
<p>If there are multiple criteria for prestige allocation in our society, and we learn 
preferentially from the prestigious, how do we choose which prestigious person we 
should attend to and learn from? From an evolutionary perspective, we would ex-
pect that the receipt and filtering of cultural information would be strategic and thus 
dependent on the current status of the &ldquo;recipient,&rdquo; that is, our age, gender, social 
class, group membership, relative rank within a group, and likely other factors. If 
I am a child, then the most prestigious older child in my group is likely to provide 
the most immediately useful cultural information for me. If I am being trained as a 
physician, then I will pay preferential attention to practicing physicians5. If I am a

known to complain that the students pay little attention to them, despite their often considerable </p>

<p>heterosexual around puberty, then theory predicts that I pay preferential attention 
not just to those prestigious in general but to those who appear to be highly suc-
cessful in intrasexual competition: The actors depicted in films and in the media as 
having full and successful romantic lives will be the prestigious figures to whose 
activities I pay close attention.
</p>
<p>We choose our competitive arenas strategically because not all spheres of pres-
tige are equal: they themselves are often ranked. In general, the more complex 
and populous the society, the more spheres of symbolic rank exist. In which arena 
should I choose to seek prestige and respect? Barkow (1989) argues that the ado-
lescent&rsquo;s problem in our own society is not precisely to find one&rsquo;s &ldquo;identity,&rdquo; as 
Erikson (1950) believed, but to choose the arena for competition in which one will 
do best&mdash;it is the choice of arena that sets the identity. Should one be a footballer or 
a good student, should one seek popularity or a reputation for wildness and daring? 
The relative standing of different arenas can often be questioned: Who is higher, a 
chess expert or someone who rebuilds their car from the ground up? Is the profes-
sor more prestigious than the banker or the real estate developer, the construction 
worker more respected than the soldier? Is wealth the ultimate form of prestige or 
does how one obtains it and what one does with it determine its prestige value? We 
tend to see the arenas in which we ourselves do well in competition as being of 
greater value or higher rank than the arenas in which we strategically do not com-
pete. If I was always picked last for the ball team then I will not compete for prestige 
as an athlete and will tend to withhold respect for athletes as a group. Familiarity 
also plays a role in my choice of domain of competition: If I have family members 
in the legal field but none in medicine then I may choose law school over medical 
school. If no one I know has a military career then I am less likely than the children 
of military families to seek admission to West Point.
</p>
<p>Because we each participate in multiple prestige arenas, we may strategize in our 
daily interactions. For example, when I meet a stranger, I may mention the garden 
I am proud of; on finding that the other has a far larger and more beautiful garden 
than my own, I may move the competition from skill and knowledge of gardening 
to golf or to cuisine. We remain primates, however: lurking beneath all competi-
tion in symbolic spheres is agonism (Barkow 1975; Barkow et al. 2012). If I lose 
in symbolic competition with you, I may grow angry and physically assault you, 
or at least want to. In organized sports (soccer, ice hockey, and American football, 
for example), the symbolic competition of a game with clear rules often breaks 
down, resulting in actual physical violence. Cultures clearly differ in the extent to 
which recourse to violence, or at least threat, is compatible with respect and pres-
tige. Honor cultures, as described by Nisbett and Cohen (1996), appear to link rank, 
prestige, and capacity for effective violence, as do the Ya̧nomam&ouml; (Chagnon 1977). 
Fessler (2006) shows how the &ldquo;male flash of anger&rdquo; can be used strategically, in 
social interaction. In real life, seeking prestige as opposed to seeking to dominate 
</p>
<p>eminence as researchers; professors who are practicing physicians seem to find it easier to attract 
the attention of the students.</p>

<p>392 Prestige and the Ongoing Process of Culture Revision
</p>
<p>through fear are often tactics with the same strategic goal, that of achieving high 
rank in the hierarchy.
</p>
<p>Both mathematical models and experimental design necessarily and legitimately 
simplify complex social reality. Thus, hierarchical relationships based on fear (ago-
nism, dominance) may be treated by researchers as separate and distinct from those 
based on respect and affection (hedonic or prestige-related). But it is important not 
to confuse how social learning and cultural transmission occur in the real world 
with models and experiments&mdash;these supplement but can never replace naturalistic 
observation and ethnographic fieldwork. In the real world, the world in which we 
evolved, ambivalence rules, and &ldquo;hedonic&rdquo; and &ldquo;agonistic&rdquo; attention are likely to be 
intertwined, perhaps along with envy or even sexual attraction.
</p>
<p>Begged Questions in Cultural Learning
</p>
<p>Even to argue that &ldquo;we choose our competitive areas strategically&rdquo; begs a host of 
questions. To begin with a major theoretical issue, all social learning starts with so-
cial attention, and any attentional mechanism could, in principle, have served as an 
exaptation for some aspect of the social learning/filtering that is involved in culture 
&ldquo;transmission.&rdquo; Prestige is not necessarily the only filter there is for filtering the 
transmission of cultural information, leading to the following questions:
</p>
<p>1. Are there non-prestige related mechanisms for some kinds of cultural learning 
which play a role in cultural transmission/editing? For example, a mother&ndash;infant 
pair strongly attract our attention. Is child-care information learned through 
attention to mother&ndash;infant pairs regardless of the prestige of the mother and 
infant? Similarly, danger is an attention attractor: Is danger-related learning inde-
pendent of the prestige (or other index of relative standing) of the individual(s) 
from whom we learn about the danger? Finally, we tend to pay close attention 
to our rivals: does rivalry lead to cultural learning and therefore information 
transmission?
</p>
<p>2. Alternatively, is prestige/relative standing the primary gateway for cultural learn-
ing/editing? In that case, we would expect to find conceptually simple evolved 
mechanisms&mdash;switches&mdash;that merely determine to which individuals in which 
situations, given our current age, our gender, and our self-evaluation, we accord 
prestige and therefore from whom we learn.
</p>
<p>3. Are there evolved algorithms that cause us to act as if we were weighing our 
past history of success in various domains against the local relative standing of 
each domain vis-&agrave;-vis one another? For example, does the prestige of medicine 
outweigh the difficulty I have in studying it, as opposed to the ease with which I 
can learn the lower-ranked field of automobile mechanics? (This is what Barkow 
[1989] refers to as the size-of-frog versus size-of-puddle problem.)
</p>
<p>4. Do high-ranked individuals abuse their prestige power by deliberately putting 
self-serving information into the cultural information pool? This possibility was 
previously discussed under the &ldquo;Culture is not necessarily adaptive&rdquo; subhead-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40 J. H. Barkow
</p>
<p>ing of &ldquo;Elites appropriate.&rdquo; Certainly, cultural information often seems to favor 
some groups at the expense of others, e.g., the Hindu caste system, the privileges 
of the aged in gerontocracies, or the genital mutilation of women and the various 
other efforts to control female sexuality that are common, cross-culturally: Is it 
possible to experimentally investigate self-serving cultural transmission on the 
part of the prestigious?
</p>
<p>5. Do the criteria in terms of which we accord prestige to others change in a predict-
able manner, over the life course?
</p>
<p>6. Does the apparent promise of high-value sexual partners affect our choice of 
domain of competition (and therefore strongly affect cultural learning)? The ter-
rorist recruiters who created websites guaranteeing 72 virgins to male &ldquo;martyrs&rdquo; 
(that is, suicide bombers) obviously thought it did. Sexuality and current mating 
preferences may strongly influence the behavior and cultural learning of younger 
humans. This influence may be the product of specialized evolved mechanisms, 
as suggested in begged question #1, above; or it may be that sexuality influences 
our choices of whom we find prestigious, in accordance with begged question 
#2.
</p>
<p>7. Did human intelligence in part evolve as a way to filter the filter, that is, to per-
mit us to consciously decide which aspects of a high-status person&rsquo;s behavior 
are worth acquiring, and which aspects should be ignored?6 That is, does intel-
ligence mitigate our tendency to learn preferentially from the prestigious?
</p>
<p>All of these questions merit further discussion but let us focus on the last: Prestige 
may filter cultural information but the filter needs a filter, otherwise we would be 
acquiring more useless than useful information from the high ranking. How do we 
determine which traits associated with a high-status figure are relevant to attaining 
that status, and which are irrelevant? That is, how do we isolate adaptive signal 
from useless (or even maladaptive) noise? One possibility, as was suggested, is that 
human intelligence in part evolved as a way to do this required secondary filtering. 
Intelligence may permit us to decide consciously which aspects of a high-status 
person&rsquo;s behavior to learn about and perhaps acquire ourselves, and which aspects 
are best ignored. If so, then intelligence and preferential learning from the high-in-
status must have evolved in tandem. Support for this hypothesis would require ex-
perimental evidence establishing that we are highly discriminating in what we learn 
from a high-status person, limiting the information acquired or behavioral traits 
adopted to those likely to enhance our own relative standing. (The marketing indus-
try&rsquo;s use of celebrity spokespeople suggests they are assuming that this hypothesis 
would not be supported empirically.)
</p>
<p>6 If much of cultural capacity and, indeed, human psychology itself, was indeed produced by 
sexual selection, then it was our biological &ldquo;Big Bang;&rdquo; a constant concern with sex is apparently 
our species&rsquo; equivalent of Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.</p>

<p>412 Prestige and the Ongoing Process of Culture Revision
</p>
<p>Subverting Cultural Transmission by Debasing Local Prestige
</p>
<p>Our ancestors lived in small bands of hunter&ndash;gatherers; even with the coming of 
agriculture, 10,000&ndash;12,000 years ago, until very recently most of us still lived in 
small communities. In such settings, prestige as a filter for the transmission of cul-
tural information works well. There is little ambiguity, in small communities, about 
who has which skills, about which people can keep their babies alive and healthy 
and which cannot, about who makes the best tools or brings back or grows the 
most food, about who is the best tracker and who can make people laugh or tell 
stories and who can settle disputes. Cultural transmission was largely face-to-face, 
for almost all of human history, and knowledge of relative standing and skill-level 
was public and largely accurate: Much of cultural learning was directly relevant to 
everyday experience.
</p>
<p>Of course, human communities have rarely been totally isolated. In the past, the 
occasional traveler, trader, raider, or refugee would have potentially brought new 
knowledge. Those who gave them respect or fear might learn from them.7 Local 
dignitaries, however, could still be respected, permitting the transmission of rel-
evant, local/indigenous knowledge to continue.
</p>
<p>In my own field experience (Barkow 1982), upon arriving in the town of Dudu-
guru (near Lafia, in Nigeria&rsquo;s Middle Belt), during the 1970s, my host took me on 
a tour. He pointed out a woman to me and recited how many children she had had 
(18) and proudly told me that almost all of them were alive and well. He took me to 
see a young man playing with his toddler and spoke in awe of the number of hills 
for yam-planting this man had heaped in a single day. These were local successes, 
local highly respected individuals. In a society experiencing only slow to moderate 
change, it would have been adaptive indeed to learn from these people.
</p>
<p>But Duduguru and its Migili people were experiencing change at a furious rate. 
Many of the young men had joined the Nigerian Army and had been shocked to 
learn that their revered elders, who followed Migili traditional, geography-bound 
religion (I was shown precisely where the gods live), were held in contempt by the 
dominant, non-Migili, Moslem population. Shortly before I began fieldwork, many 
of the young men had withdrawn from the traditional religion and the traditional 
age-grade social organization and even physically assaulted the elders, resulting in 
immediate and dramatic change. The religious, political, and economic organiza-
tion of their society, a gerontocracy, collapsed.
</p>
<p>Modern media, first the movies and now the internet, arguably may be turning 
the whole planet into Duduguru by breaking the ancient chain of cultural transmis-
sion. This is because the media present to us figures who apparently have more 
prestige than do our locally respected characters. They appear to be physically 
beautiful, in wonderful health, wealthy and powerful, feared or desired by other 
</p>
<p>7 Respect or prestige should not be confused with affection or even the absence of enmity. The 
USA has been hated in much of the world by people who nevertheless readily adopt its entertain-
ers and some of its cultural practices. American-style rap music and fast food, for example, are 
popular in many places in which America itself is not.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>42 J. H. Barkow
</p>
<p>high-status people. Our local politician or police officer, hockey coach or business 
person, shrinks in standing when compared to the Hollywood or Bollywood star or 
the gold medal Olympic athlete or the bling-covered rapper with an entourage of 
attractive people. All over the world, children are learning preferentially not from 
members of their own community but from media figures whom they perceive as 
prestigious. Thus, they want to have their own bands, or to be rappers, or to learn 
kung fu, or to join political and religious movements. Local prestige is debased, and 
with it, local knowledge and the local path to prestige. When the baker is respected, 
or the man who can heap 300 hills of earth for yams in a day, or the careful mother 
who watches over her children and follows modern nutritional and medical prac-
tices, those according them prestige can learn readily what to do to achieve compa-
rable success. Local figures provide locally relevant, useful, accessible knowledge. 
Films about superheroes do not. When the superwealthy are constantly in the news, 
the locally respected person of moderate means may cease to be a prestigious figure 
whom young people attend to and learn from. Even worse, proselytizing websites 
designed to recruit may glorify alien but apparently prestigious figures, deliberately 
detaching a young person from family and friends and teaching to kill. The world 
over, many parents are wondering who their children are.
</p>
<p>Of course, this jeremiad is overblown. We know surprisingly little about the 
mechanisms of cultural transmission per se but we do know that they can differ 
from one knowledge domain to another (e.g., language is not learned the way in 
which we learn to cook or to do coiled basketry), and they likely change throughout 
the life course. At different ages, we presumably find different people with different 
attributes prestigious. Moreover, the change brought by prestigious media figures is 
not necessarily a bad thing. Larkin (1997, 2008), for example, discusses how Hausa 
women of the Nigerian city of Kano have, after a diet of Bollywood films, been 
demanding more romance from their partners! It may be, however, that prestige-
based social learning is most salient during adolescence, when choice of identity 
and prestige criteria&mdash;that is, career&mdash;appears to be made. It is this group that may 
be most vulnerable to diversion from the transmission of local knowledge. (These 
hypotheses are presented here as suggestions for future research.)
</p>
<p>Conclusions
</p>
<p>Our tendency to hierarchize is vastly important for an understanding of human psy-
chology and society. For the social scientist, social hierarchy can lead to social 
stratification, the castes and classes that form the scaffolding of large-scale soci-
ety. Each social class then seeks to keep itself distinct from the classes beneath it, 
which is why the wealthy happily pay enormous prices for everyday objects&mdash;not 
in spite of their price but because of their price (Saad 2007)&mdash;and why profes-
sors who cannot compete on the basis of wealth may do so, for example, on the 
basis of knowledge of ethnic cuisine (Bourdieu 1984). For the marketing expert, 
understanding the search for prestige and distinction is the royal road to sales. For 
the psychologist, social hierarchy&mdash;rank&mdash;is intimately related to self-esteem, and </p>

</p>
<p>prestige can certainly boost self-esteem. We have seen, in this chapter, how prestige 
enables cooperation and, importantly, how it is a significant aspect of the process of 
cultural editing or filtering.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prestige&rdquo; is of course an ordinary English/French term and it is always risky 
to seek to remake such a word into a precise, scientific concept (as does Barkow 
1975, 1989). Prestige means according respect or approval but it is confusing to 
apply it to someone as a whole because we may approve of some of what another 
does but despise other aspects of their behavior: Approval of everything another 
does is not giving them prestige but adulation, a rather different phenomenon. For 
research purposes, it may be better to begin by contrasting agonistic with nonago-
nistic relative standing, and then to analyze the components of the latter; prestige 
is likely to be a large but probably not the sole element in this category; the cur-
rent rather global approach to &ldquo;prestige&rdquo; may be leading us to pay less attention to 
other nonagonistic factors that may influence hierarchizing (such as age, gender, 
physical attractiveness, and verbal facility). We may also find that we need to speak 
of &ldquo;domain-specific&rdquo; respect or prestige, with the term referring not to dedicated 
evolved mechanisms but to specific spheres of information or skills. Within estab-
lished groups, there may also be situation-specific social rank (the most respected 
person when we go hunting may trade places with another when we are talking 
about investment opportunities). True, contrasting &ldquo;prestige&rdquo; with &ldquo;dominance&rdquo; has 
thus far worked reasonably well in the laboratory (e.g., Cheng et al. 2013) and 
even in field settings (e.g., von Rueden et al. 2011; Reyes-Garc&iacute;a et al. 2009). We 
must never forget, however, that both at the individual and collective level, they are 
typically intermingled. Human relationships are componential, after all, and may 
include (for example) fear, affection, respect, envy, sexual attraction, and disgust, 
the dominant sentiment possibly shifting from moment to moment; with each shift 
a corresponding change in the amount of attention we are paying to a particular 
individual or to their current activities may take place.
</p>
<p>Perhaps even more interesting than how we attend to and learn preferentially 
from the high-ranking is the consequences for the low: They become invisible. 
Even Chance, who first understood that we pay preferential attention to the high-in-
status, failed to theorize about inattention to the low-in-status. It is embarrassing to 
realize just how much we know about high-ranking media celebrities, for example, 
even celebrities whom we profess to despise: We simply cannot take our attention 
away from them, while it takes a determined effort of will to pay attention to the 
poor, the lame, the homeless, or the guy who asks us for &ldquo;spare change&rdquo; (Barkow 
et al. 2012). This behavior looks like a lack of compassion but to some extent may 
simply be a product of evolved inattention. Presumably, our ancestors became our 
ancestors in part because they paid attention to the individuals who were potentially 
good mates, reciprocity partners, sources of resources or useful knowledge; or were 
dangerous. Paying attention to those who fit in none of these categories did not reli-</p>

<p>Do Status Hierarchies Benefit Groups?  
</p>
<p>A Bounded Functionalist Account of Status

</p>
<p>Status hierarchies are said to emerge in all human social groups, in that some in-
dividuals inevitably develop more respect, prominence, and influence than others 
(Bernstein 1981; Davis and Moore 1945; Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989; Hogan 1983; Leavitt 
2005; Magee and Galinsky 2008; Mazur 1973; Parsons 1940; Schjelderup-Ebbe 
1935; Tannenbaum et al. 1974; Van Vugt et al. 2008). But while status inequality 
may be ubiquitous in groups, this does not necessarily mean that this inequality is 
beneficial to them. Here we address the question of whether or not groups benefit 
from the presence of status hierarchies.
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there exist two prevailing views of the effects of status hier-
archies on group outcomes. Functionalist accounts view status hierarchies as vi-
tal organizing structures of social order. Scholars associated with this view note 
important ways in which status hierarchies support groups, for example, reducing 
intragroup conflict over influence and control (Barnard 1938) and motivating in-
dividual sacrifice for the collective good (Willer 2009). Much evidence supports 
this functionalist account, for example, by demonstrating that clear hierarchies are 
associated with more peaceful and effective interactions among group members 
(Bendersky and Hays 2012) and that the lure of higher status can promote group-
oriented behavior (Griskevicius et al. 2010).
</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, critical accounts of status hierarchies see them as divisive sourc-
es of inequality at the microlevel. Scholars of this view often note that such hierarchies 
allocate important social rewards like respect and influence not on the basis of indi-
vidual competence, but instead based on characteristics assigned value arbitrarily by 
the larger culture (e.g., race, gender, social class; Berger et al. 1972). Consistent with 
this view, much empirical evidence demonstrates that status hierarchies can wreak 
severe damage on groups, for example, impairing collective performance (Anderson

<p>and Brown 2010), lowering morale (Smith and Tannenbaum 1963), and undermining 
group members&rsquo; satisfaction and well-being (Pfeffer and Langton 1993). How can 
these findings be reconciled with those supporting functionalist accounts?
</p>
<p>We see merit in both perspectives and here seek an integrated view that acknowl-
edges the evidence and logic supporting each perspective.1 Specifically, we believe 
an appropriate way to understand the social impact of status hierarchies is through 
a bounded functionalist perspective. Similar to the notion of bounded rationality 
(Simon 1957), which argues individuals strive to be rational but are limited in their 
ability to do so, we propose that group members strive to form functional hierar-
chies that will serve group goals, but are similarly limited in their ability to do so. 
Individuals aim to allocate status in a merit-based fashion that will benefit groups 
and their members, but their efforts are constrained by a number of critical obstacles 
such as the opacity of individual merit and the resisting force of self-interest among 
members. While group members&rsquo; intentions to allocate status on the basis of merit 
result in hierarchies that are based on individuals&rsquo; perceived value to the group, they 
are also challenged by the many difficulties in assessing merit and various undesir-
able behaviors that are encouraged by the lure of status incentives.
</p>
<p>In the review below, we first outline the basic tenets of functionalist models 
of status and summarize empirical evidence supporting this broad perspective. We 
then discuss wide-ranging evidence that hierarchies often fail to live up to the ide-
als suggested by functionalism. Finally, we outline a bounded functionalist model 
of status and summarize evidence to support its claims. By doing so we describe 
how such a model might integrate and synthesize the many complex and seemingly 
contradictory findings within the status literature.
</p>
<p>Functionalist Perspectives of Status
</p>
<p>Many scholars across social scientific disciplines have adopted a functionalist view 
of status processes (e.g., Anderson et al. 2006; Blau 1964; Gruenfeld and Tiedens 
2010; Homans 1950; Magee and Galinsky 2008; Simpson et al. 2012; Thibaut and 
Kelley 1959; Willer 2009). These scholars vary in some of their specific hypotheses 
or intellectual traditions, but converge on the idea that status facilitates group wel-
fare by serving numerous social functions. More specifically, status hierarchies are 
thought to help groups solve some of their most fundamental problems.
</p>
<p>One of these problems is collective decision making. Group members pos-
sess different perspectives and motivations, and therefore often disagree over the 
</p>
<p>1 Note that here we specifically analyze the group-level effects of status hierarchies, setting aside 
the equally important individual-level effects of status hierarchies. Research is divisive on this 
issue as well, with some work suggesting that status-striving undermines individual well-being 
(Nickerson et al. 2003) and that much discrimination on the basis of characteristics like race, class, 
and gender occurs through status processes in groups. At the same time, other work emphasizes 
that status striving motivates collectively minded behavior (Willer 2009) and status attainment 
fosters happiness (Anderson et al. 2012) and health (Marmot 2004).</p>

</p>
<p>group&rsquo;s collective goals and the appropriate strategies to pursue those goals. Group 
members must find a way to make decisions in a peaceful, effective, and efficient 
manner (e.g., Cartwright and Zander 1953; Levine and Moreland 1990; Van Vugt 
et al. 2008). A second problem is group locomotion or collective action. Groups 
must motivate individual members to behave in ways that contribute to the group&rsquo;s 
success, even when such behavior might require personal investment and individ-
ual sacrifice (e.g., Hardin 1982; Kerr and Tindale 2004; Latane et al. 1979; Willer 
2009). A third problem is the coordination of individual behavior. It is not enough 
for groups to have a clear vision and for members to act on it. They must also 
coordinate members&rsquo; behavior so that they work in concert toward collective suc-
cess&mdash;for example, by allocating complementary tasks and responsibilities to each 
individual, maintaining effective communication among members, and minimizing 
intragroup conflict (e.g., Blau and Scott 1962; Cartwright and Zander 1953; Hinsz 
et al. 1997; Levine and Moreland 1990).
</p>
<p>Collective Decision Making
</p>
<p>Hierarchies are thought to help groups solve problems with collective decision 
making by giving disproportionate control to higher-ranking members (Van Vugt 
et al. 2008). High-status individuals are granted greater control over decisions and 
allowed to direct others&rsquo; actions, whereas lower-ranked individuals are expected to 
defer to others and keep their opinions to themselves (Bales et al. 1951; Berger et al. 
1980; Goffman 1967; Keltner et al. 2003). This concentration of control at the top 
of the hierarchy is thought to help groups make decisions more efficiently and avoid 
conflict (Cartwright and Zander 1953; Van Vugt et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>As evidence, Bales&rsquo; classic studies of small groups found that the top-ranking 
group members spoke 15 times more frequently than the lowest-ranking group mem-
bers and nearly five times more than the next highest-ranking members (Bales et al. 
1951). Buzaglo and Wheelan (1999) found that higher-status members of a team 
dominated team discussions, speaking more than 75 % of the time, even though they 
represented only 30 % of the team&rsquo;s membership. Anderson and Kilduff&rsquo;s (2009) 
study of four-person teams found that 94 % of the time, teams chose the first propos-
al offered by any member as their final answer&mdash;and that the top-ranking members 
were nearly three times more likely to provide the first proposal than anyone else.
</p>
<p>Empirical evidence also supports the argument that a clear hierarchy reduces 
intragroup conflict. When individuals agree over their relative status, groups have 
lower levels of conflict, higher levels of cohesion, and increased trust among their 
members (Anderson et al. 2006; Bendersky and Hays 2012; Kilduff et al. 2013). 
For example, Greer et al. (2011) found that teams with clearer hierarchies engaged 
in less process conflict, performing better on joint tasks as a result. In Tiedens and 
Fragale&rsquo;s (2003) studies hierarchical dyads (wherein one person behaved dominant-
ly and the other behaved submissively) were more cohesive than egalitarian dyads 
(wherein both people behaved dominantly or both submissively).</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>In facilitating collective decision making, hierarchies are also thought to increase 
the quality of group decisions by giving disproportionate control to the individuals 
perceived to be the most competent. Decisions about a group&rsquo;s goals or strategies 
are often fraught with ambiguity and intimidating complexity. Competent individu-
als presumably make better decisions for the group than would those with lesser or 
average acuity (Berger et al. 1980; Davis and Moore 1945; Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989; 
Ridgeway and Diekema 1989). Accordingly, groups strive to put their most com-
petent members in charge by allocating influence to those who seem most expert.
</p>
<p>Much evidence shows that groups accord higher status to individuals believed to 
possess greater competence, intelligence, and expertise (e.g., for reviews, see Bass 
1981; Berger et al. 1980; Driskell and Mullen 1990; Lord et al. 1986; Van Vugt 
2006). In fact, perceived competence may be the most consistent predictor of status 
across social groups, and the effects of perceived competence can be quite large. For 
example, Anderson and colleagues have found peer-rated competence in groups to 
predict status with correlations in the .60&rsquo;s and .70&rsquo;s (Anderson and Kilduff 2009; 
Anderson et al. 2012). Further, groups perform better when they put their most 
competent members in charge (Maier 1967; Roby et al. 1963).
</p>
<p>Group Locomotion
</p>
<p>In addition to collective decision making, groups also face the challenge of moti-
vating their members to make costly contributions to group efforts. Groups must 
motivate individual members to set aside their personal motives and agendas and 
contribute to the group&rsquo;s collective endeavors. Status hierarchies are believed to 
provide social, material, and psychological incentives that help accomplish this goal 
(Barnard 1938; Blau 1964; Davis and Moore 1945; Frank 1985; Hardy and Van 
Vugt 2006; Homans 1950; Keltner et al. 2008; Thibaut and Kelley 1959; Willer 
2009). For example, higher status involves greater respect and admiration (Berger 
et al. 1972) and provides higher levels of autonomy (Bales et al. 1951), power (An-
derson et al. 2012), self-esteem (Leary et al. 1995), subjective well-being (Tay and 
Diener 2011), lower physiological stress (Gruenewald et al. 2006), and material 
resources (Willer 2009).
</p>
<p>Groups allocate higher status to members perceived as contributing to the group&rsquo;s 
goals. Those perceived as making important contributions are granted higher sta-
tus, whereas those seen as making fewer contributions, or even as undermining a 
group&rsquo;s success, are assigned lower status. By rewarding group-oriented behavior, 
status compels individual members to work toward the group&rsquo;s goals, facilitating 
collective success (Barnard 1938; Blau 1964; Thibaut and Kelley 1959). Individual 
members are driven to sacrifice and contribute to the group&rsquo;s welfare in order to 
earn the myriad rewards that come with being on top of the ladder.
</p>
<p>Much empirical evidence validates these arguments. Field studies of organiza-
tions show employees who help their fellow coworkers are accorded higher status at 
work (Blau 1964; Flynn 2003; Flynn et al. 2006; Roethlesberger and Dickson 1939; 
Sutton and Hargadon 1996). Laboratory research has also found that individuals </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>513 Do Status Hierarchies Benefit Groups? A Bounded Functionalist Account of Status
</p>
<p>who give more generously in social dilemmas are accorded a more &ldquo;positive image 
score,&rdquo; reflecting their reputation as prosocial (Fehr and Fischbacher 2003; Nowak 
and Sigmund 1998). Researchers also find that individuals who contribute more 
to (or take less from) a group fund attain higher status because they are viewed as 
valuing the group (Hardy and van Vugt 2006; Willer 2009).
</p>
<p>Moreover, research demonstrates that the lure of status encourages self-sacrifice 
for group ends (Willer et al. 2010). When individuals face the possibility of attain-
ing higher status, such as when their behavior is more public, they tend give more 
generously (Fehr and Fischbacher 2003; Milinski et al. 2002a, b, 2006; Nowak 
and Sigmund 1998). Baumeister&rsquo;s (1982) review of the self-presentation literature 
found that when people believe their behavior is public, they give more to charities 
(e.g., Satow 1975) and help those in immediate danger (Gottlieb and Carver 1980). 
Therefore, people behave in a more group-oriented fashion when it will benefit 
their status the most. Studies of &ldquo;competitive altruism&rdquo; show that status motives 
can heighten individuals&rsquo; generosity (Hardy and van Vugt 2006; Barclay and Willer 
2007). Many tribes in the Pacific Northwest Coast engage in the ritual of potlatch-
ing, wherein tribal chiefs compete to give away their possessions in order to at-
tain the most respect and prestige (Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989). Griskevicius et al. (2010) 
also found status concerns can drive communally minded behavior: When they ex-
perimentally boosted participants&rsquo; desire for status they preferred environmentally 
friendly products over better performing, more luxurious products. Further, consis-
tent with prior work, this effect was more pronounced when purchases were made in 
a public setting, such as in a store, as opposed to shopping online at home.
</p>
<p>In addition to promoting generosity and helpfulness, studies have shown that 
status can motivate stronger effort and performance. Research on social facilita-
tion has long shown that in front of an audience (where status gains are at stake), 
people work harder and perform better on tasks at which they are well practiced 
(Zajonc 1965), and that these audience effects are driven by concerns over social 
evaluation of their competence (e.g., Bond 1982; Cottrell et al. 1968), suggesting 
status concerns might be key to the effect. Kilduff and colleagues&rsquo; work on rivalry 
shows that when individuals compete with someone they deem a rival, they feel 
their status is at stake (Kilduff et al. 2012). These feelings of rivalry in turn motivate 
people to work harder to perform better (Kilduff et al. 2010). Research on Tesser&rsquo;s 
(1988) Self-Evaluation Maintenance model also shows that individuals work harder 
and perform better when their friends outperform them on a laboratory task or in 
school&mdash;especially when they feel personally invested in that domain (and thus 
likely feel their status is at stake).
</p>
<p>Finally, by providing higher status to individuals who contribute more, groups 
also keep their strongest contributors committed to the collective and dissuade those 
individuals from leaving the group. Thibaut and Kelley (1959) argued groups use 
status to compensate individuals who provide a great deal of value to the collective, 
and who might have alternative groups they could join: &ldquo;The status system consti-
tutes a form of currency with which members upon whom the group is highly depen-
dent may be paid off.&rdquo; (p. 232). This commitment mechanism has been proposed by 
a number of scholars (e.g., Barnard 1938; Homans 1950; Frank 1985; Willer 2009).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>52 C. Anderson and R. Willer
</p>
<p>As evidence, many studies have found that when individuals are accorded 
higher status they are more committed to their group. Huo et al. (2010) found that 
when people felt they had higher status in their group they were more committed 
to it and less likely to leave. Helping establish the causal role of status on group 
commitment, Willer (2009) as well as Kennedy and Anderson (2013) led randomly 
selected individuals to believe their laboratory group accorded them high status 
and led others to believe their group accorded them low status. As expected, fol-
lowing this feedback, those in the high-status condition were more committed to 
the group.
</p>
<p>Intragroup Coordination
</p>
<p>Making decisions and motivating members is not the only problem groups must 
address to be successful. It is also critical for groups to coordinate their members&rsquo; 
behavior so that their contributions combine in a maximally effective and efficient 
way. Hierarchies are thought to help groups address this challenge in a number 
of ways. As previously mentioned, hierarchies putatively facilitate an orderly di-
vision of resources and influence among group members (Barnard 1938; Berger 
et al. 1980; Chance 1967; Durkheim 1893/1997; Katz and Kahn 1966; Keltner et al. 
2008; Leavitt 2005; Magee and Galinsky 2008; Marx 1844/1964; Mintzberg 1979; 
Parsons 1961; Tiedens et al. 2007). Differential allocation of responsibilities and 
control helps mitigate the common problem of having &ldquo;too many cooks in the kitch-
en,&rdquo; wherein too many individuals try to take on a leadership role.
</p>
<p>Hierarchies are also believed to allow information to flow between members 
more efficiently and for the integration of this information to occur more easily 
(Bavelas 1950; Leavitt 2005; Scott 1998; Vroom 1969; Williamson 1975). For ex-
ample, in the prototypical pyramidal hierarchy, information travels up through hi-
erarchical levels until it reaches group leaders. The leaders integrate this diverse 
information and make relevant decisions. Their decisions then flow down to each 
respective hierarchical level and are implemented according to leaders&rsquo; plans.
</p>
<p>Supportive evidence for these arguments can be found in classic laboratory stud-
ies of communication structure by Bavelas and colleagues (e.g., Bavelas 1950; 
Leavitt 1951; Christie et al. 1952). These studies experimentally manipulated the 
communication channels between different group members while they worked on a 
joint task, allowing some members to directly communicate with each other while 
precluding others from communicating. For example, in a four-person group with a 
&ldquo;wheel&rdquo; structure, one person was allowed to communicate with all others, while all 
other members could only communicate with this central person, and all messages 
thus had to flow through that central person. In contrast, in a &ldquo;comcon&rdquo; configura-
tion, all members could communicate with each other, and a priori, no member was 
more central in the communication flow than any other. These different communi-
cation structures determined the steepness of the group&rsquo;s hierarchy (e.g., Bavelas 
1950; Leavitt 1951; Shaw 1954). Structures such as the wheel tended to have a </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>533 Do Status Hierarchies Benefit Groups? A Bounded Functionalist Account of Status
</p>
<p>more hierarchical structure, with the central members receiving more leadership 
nominations and having more control over the decisions made by the group (Mulder 
1960). Shaw&rsquo;s (1964) review of this literature found that more hierarchical struc-
tures were advantageous for simple tasks, leading to faster solutions 78 % of the 
time and to fewer errors 90 % of the time.
</p>
<p>Finally, hierarchies are thought to coordinate group activity by providing a sys-
tem in which individual members model their behavior after high-status individuals. 
A large body of work has shown that individuals pay inordinate amount of attention 
to those with high status (Chance 1967; Fiske 1993; Keltner et al. 2003). In fact, 
some have considered attention and status to be so closely intertwined that attention 
should be viewed as a defining feature of status (Chance 1967). As evidence, Cheng 
et al. (2013) used eye-tracking techniques and found participants spent more time 
visually attending to high-status group members than low-status group members, 
even after they controlled for differences in how much the group members spoke. 
In fact, status accounted for 46 % of the variance in where individuals directed their 
attention.
</p>
<p>Attention to those with high status likely reflects a general preoccupation with 
status, but it also likely arises from a drive to model those at the top of the hierar-
chy (Eibl-Eibesfelt 1989; Festinger 1954; French and Raven 1959). By mimicking 
high-status individuals&rsquo; behavior, individuals conform to group norms and behave 
in ways valued by the group. Anderson et al. (2003), for example, used laboratory 
procedures to induce and assess emotional responses in college roommates over the 
course of an academic year. They found roommates became emotionally similar 
over time; yet it was the roommates with lower status in the dormitory that made 
virtually all of the change necessary for this convergence to occur. In fact, high-
status roommates&rsquo; emotions at the beginning of the year strongly predicted low-
status roommates&rsquo; emotions at the end of the year ( r = 0.69). By contrast, low-status 
roommates&rsquo; initial emotions did not significantly predict high-status roommates&rsquo; 
later emotions ( r = 0.19).
</p>
<p>Hierarchies also help to solve collective action problems by coordinating both 
sequences and amounts of contributions via status processes. In a laboratory study 
in which participants could contribute to a group fund, Simpson et al. (2012) found 
that higher-status individuals tended to be the first contributors, overcoming the 
collective action start-up problem. Further, once they have contributed, high-status 
individuals exert influence over other group members regarding how much they 
should give to group efforts. Kumru and Vesterlund (2010) randomly assigned par-
ticipants to be high or low status in a social dilemma game context. In half the 
groups, high-status participants were designated to make the first decision as to how 
much they would contribute; in the remaining half, the low-status participant made 
the first decision. First-movers&rsquo; contribution decisions were relayed to the second 
contributor, who then decided how much of his or her private endowment to con-
tribute to the public good. They found lower-status second movers mimicked the 
contributions of high-status first movers far more than higher-status second movers 
mimicked first movers.</p>

<p>Status Hierarchies and Group Performance
</p>
<p>Additional evidence supporting the functionalist perspective of status stems from 
studies examining the effects of hierarchy on overall group performance. For exam-
ple, Carzo and Yanouzas (1969) examined 15-person groups tasked with estimating 
how much demand existed for a product in various markets and, accordingly, how 
much of the product they should order from suppliers. They found that groups per-
formed better in a taller (three-level) than in a flatter (two-level) hierarchy. Maier 
and Solem (1952) found that groups working on a math task performed better when 
they had a leader than when they did not. Main et al. (1993) found a positive rela-
tion between pay disparity within executive teams and firm performance. Ronay 
et al. (2012) found that teams whose members differed in their power &ldquo;mindset&rdquo; 
or in their testosterone levels performed better in laboratory tasks. Halevy et al. 
(2013) found that pay disparities among members of professional basketball teams 
predicted winning percentages and a host of individual-level performance metrics 
(e.g., assists, defensive rebounds, field goal percentages).
</p>
<p>Evidence of Dysfunction Wrought by Status Differences
</p>
<p>The evidence cited thus far suggests that the case for functionalism is quite strong. 
A large number of scholars from diverse intellectual traditions have espoused argu-
ments consistent with the functionalist view of status hierarchies. In addition, some 
evidence supports many of functionalism&rsquo;s basic claims, showing that clear status 
hierarchies can mitigate intragroup conflict and that status can promote group-ori-
ented behavior. However, the above arguments and evidence notwithstanding, there 
is also considerable empirical support for the critical view of the effects of status 
hierarchies in which status differences have primarily deleterious effects on groups. 
Indeed, the empirical record paints a much more complicated picture than the func-
tionalist ideal would suggest. It shows, for example, that status hierarchies are often 
not based on individual competence and commitment, and that hierarchical groups 
often fare worse than groups with flatter structures. We review this evidence below.
</p>
<p>Breakdowns in the Status Organizing Process
</p>
<p>Functionalists argue that groups strive to give higher status to individuals who are 
more competent and committed to the group&rsquo;s goals. By doing so, groups allo-
cate influence and leadership on the basis of relevant skills, motivate individuals 
to make greater contributions to the group, and help retain their most talented and 
group-oriented individuals as members. However, much research suggests that 
groups often fail to accord status meritoriously, placing incompetent or less com-
mitted individuals in positions of high status. Failures of status allocation give the </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>553 Do Status Hierarchies Benefit Groups? A Bounded Functionalist Account of Status
</p>
<p>wrong individuals disproportionate control over the group and its decisions, thereby 
decreasing the group&rsquo;s effectiveness (Barnard 1938). In this review, we focus on 
two individual characteristics on which groups strive to base status differences: task 
competence and commitment to the group. We do not mean to imply these are the 
only individual characteristics relevant to status (e.g., Anderson et al. 2001); but use 
them as examples because they are highly related to status standing in most group 
settings (Van Vugt 2006).
</p>
<p>Task Competence High-status group members&rsquo; duties and responsibilities can be 
social in nature; for example, they are often expected to inspire their group, keep 
the peace among its members, and facilitate communication between individuals 
(Van Vugt et al. 2008). However, in most group settings they also must understand 
the technical problems faced by the group. Having task competent people in charge 
helps groups perform better (for a review, see Bass 1981). Therefore, many groups 
prioritize task competence over other factors like social skills when allocating influ-
ence (Lord et al. 1980). On a team of engineers, for example, technical ability would 
likely be seen as more important than the ability to communicate.
</p>
<p>However, groups often fail to base their status hierarchies on differences in task 
competence. For example, much research in the Status Characteristics Theory tradi-
tion finds that group members base status allocation on characteristics like gender, 
race, social class, and physical attractiveness, assuming that these characteristics 
are associated with general competence, even when they are not (Berger et al. 1972, 
1980). Similarly, individuals higher in self-confidence are also more likely to be 
selected leaders (Edinger and Patterson 1983; Stogdill 1948), though self-confi-
dence is not highly predictive of actual abilities (Dunning et al. 2004; Harris and 
Schaubroeck 1988).
</p>
<p>One particularly telling case concerns the personality trait of dominance. An 
abundance of research shows that individuals higher in trait dominance tend to at-
tain higher status than others in groups (Anderson and Kilduff 2009; Gough et al. 
1951; Judge et al. 2002; Lord et al. 1986; Mann 1959; Megargee 1969). In fact, one 
meta-analysis found trait dominance to predict status in groups more consistently 
than any other individual difference variable, including intelligence (Lord et al. 
1986). Another meta-analysis including 73 independent samples found dominance 
to have the strongest relation to status in groups of all personality dimensions ex-
amined (Judge et al. 2002).
</p>
<p>However, dominance is unrelated to many of the competencies putatively re-
quired to attain status. For example, in prior research, individuals high in trait domi-
nance attained status in groups that discussed an ethical dilemma (Aries et al. 1983), 
worked on mechanical tasks (Megargee et al. 1966; Smith and Foti 1998), and allo-
cated funds to employees in a hypothetical company (Anderson and Berdahl 2002). 
It is difficult to believe that dominant individuals possessed any special expertise in 
ethical issues, mechanical tasks, or organizational compensation systems. Further, 
evidence suggests that trait dominance is largely unrelated to general cognitive abil-
ities (Dodge 1937; Donahue and Sattler 1971; Gough 1949; Schippmann and Prien 
1989; Smith and Foti 1998). Of course, dominance might be related to social skills </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>56 C. Anderson and R. Willer
</p>
<p>such as the ability to persuade others, but these social skills are often insufficient 
for successful leadership in the absence of technical abilities (Van Vugt 2006). The 
empirical evidence thus suggests that groups allocate status in part on the basis of 
differences in characteristics unrelated to competence, like gender, race, attractive-
ness, and dominance.
</p>
<p>Commitment to the Group&rsquo;s Success A second individual characteristic on which 
groups strive to allocate status is group orientation (e.g., Ridgeway 1982). Groups 
are thought to have a greater chance of success when those at the top of the status 
hierarchy are committed to the group&rsquo;s well-being rather than their personal agenda. 
Examples abound of selfish high-status individuals in corporations, politics, and 
religious organizations who led their groups to disastrous consequences, and empir-
ical research has documented the benefits of having prosocial people in high-status 
positions. A large meta-analysis covering over 85 years of research showed that 
agreeableness, which involves a greater concern for others (John and Srivastava 
1999), is a significant predictor of leaders&rsquo; effectiveness (Judge et al. 2002). In 14 
samples that included leaders from over 200 organizations, Judge and Bono (2000) 
also found that agreeableness was consistently related to more effective leadership 
styles. Bass (1981) also summarizes a range of evidence that groups are more likely 
to thrive with collectively minded leaders and fail with selfish leaders.
</p>
<p>However, despite the benefits of basing status on group orientation, studies sug-
gest that much of the time groups fail to accord high status to prosocial individuals. 
For example, a meta-analysis showed that agreeableness has the weakest effects on 
leader emergence of all Big Five personality traits (Judge et al. 2002). Similarly, 
researchers have found null effects for agreeableness on status in diverse kinds of 
organizations (Anderson et al. 2008) and in social-living groups like dormitories, 
fraternities, and sororities (Anderson et al. 2001). McClelland and Boyatzis (1982) 
even found that individuals lower in the need for affiliation&mdash;which involves less 
of a desire for close and friendly interpersonal relationships&mdash;were more likely to 
ascend their organization&rsquo;s hierarchy. A recent study also found that groups tend 
to select more &ldquo;social&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;prosocial&rdquo; leaders, despite their intentions to 
select prosocial leaders (Livingston et al. 2010). And, even though women tend 
to be more prosocially minded and have more concern for others than men (for 
a review, see Feingold 1994), there is vast evidence that women are selected as 
leaders less often than men (for a review, see Eagly and Karau 1991). Not only do 
groups often fail to accord prosocial individuals higher status, they even sometimes 
systematically place more selfish individuals at the top of the status order. Recent 
research has shown that the desire for higher social rank is associated with selfish-
ness (Willer et al. 2013), and studies have consistently shown that individuals who 
desire higher rank tend to achieve it (Flynn et al. 2006; McClelland and Boyatzis 
1982; Winter 1988). Thus, while experiments find that, all things being equal, more 
prosocial individuals tend to be viewed as higher status (Willer 2009), other traits 
correlated with low prosociality (e.g., desire for status, dominance, gender) may 
often reverse this effect in field settings, with less prosocial people earning high 
rank as a result.</p>

</p>
<p>Status Hierarchies and Group Welfare
</p>
<p>Another test of the functionalist view of status hierarchies is whether groups fare 
better when they have a more hierarchical status structure than when they have a 
flatter status structure. Groups with a steeper status hierarchy&mdash;that is, those with 
larger asymmetries in members&rsquo; status&mdash;should function better than groups with a 
flatter structure. Above, we described a few studies showing that more hierarchical 
groups sometimes outperform flatter groups. However, much evidence also shows 
that groups with steeper status hierarchies can fare worse than those with flatter 
and more egalitarian structures, both in terms of performance and group members&rsquo; 
attitudes.
</p>
<p>In terms of group performance, Torrance (1955) examined three-person Air 
Force flight crews and found &ldquo;real&rdquo; crews (that had been actually working together 
for a long time) performed worse on a math task than crews of strangers constructed 
temporarily for the sake of the experiment&mdash;and that this effect emerged because 
the real crews were more hierarchical than the temporary crews. For example, when 
lower-ranked members of real crews knew the correct answer to the problem they 
were less able to convince the others to accept it. Becker and Blaloff (1969) also 
manipulated whether three-person groups had an appointed leader or not and had 
them perform a task in which group members estimated the demand for products 
based on a series of dimensions, finding that more hierarchical groups performed 
worse than flatter groups. Berdahl and Anderson (2005) measured the degree to 
which undergraduate student teams who worked on a group project together natu-
rally formed more centralized leadership structures (i.e., leaders with more control 
over group activities), and found that more centralized groups performed worse 
on the team project and received lower project grades. Ivancevich and Donnelley 
(1975) examined 295 salespeople in marketing departments of three large organiza-
tions and found that those working in a more hierarchical organization performed 
worse (i.e., received fewer orders per client visited) than those working in a flatter 
organization.
</p>
<p>Studies of compensation systems are relevant as well. Pay differences often sig-
nify asymmetries in status (Davis and Moore 1945; Desai et al. 2010; Frank 1985; 
Bloom and Michel 2002). For example, individuals use their relative pay as a sign 
of how respected and valued they are relative to coworkers&mdash;and thus as a sign of 
where they fall in the workplace status hierarchy (Desai et al. 2010). Studies of 
compensation systems also place doubt on the benefits of status differences, show-
ing that greater discrepancies in pay across employees of organizations are associ-
ated with lower performance (Bloom 1999; Cowherd and Levine 1992; Hambrick 
and D&rsquo;Aveni 1992; Pfeffer and Langton 1993).
</p>
<p>Status hierarchies can also dampen group members&rsquo; attitudes and affect. Shaw&rsquo;s 
(1964) review of communication structure studies found that in 89 % of the relation-
ships he reviewed, there was a negative effect of hierarchy steepness on member 
satisfaction. Therefore, while more hierarchical structures facilitated better per-
formance when the task was simple, they almost always predicted worse group </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>58 C. Anderson and R. Willer
</p>
<p>member satisfaction. Becker and Blaloff&rsquo;s (1969) aforementioned research found 
that groups working in a hierarchical structure were more frustrated than groups 
working in egalitarian structures. In Pierce et al. (1989), managers worked on or-
ganization simulation tasks in which their company was more or less hierarchical. 
In the more hierarchical organization, individuals had lower levels of organization-
based self-esteem. Meltzer and Salter (1962) found that steeper hierarchies were 
related to lower job satisfaction, and this relationship emerged across organizations 
of different sizes. Smith and Tannenbaum (1963) found that more hierarchical chap-
ters of the League of Women Voters had lower member loyalty; they also found 
that more egalitarian decision making in divisions of a delivery company predicted 
better morale. In a study of 2976 managers outside the United States, Porter and 
Siegel (1965) found that employees of organizations with steeper hierarchies were 
less satisfied than those in flatter organizations. Carpenter&rsquo;s (1971) study of school-
teachers found that teachers were less satisfied when working in a more hierarchical 
organizational structure; in particular they reported lower satisfaction with their 
autonomy and authority levels. Tannenbaum et al. (1974) found that less hierarchi-
cal organizations had higher worker motivation; though this effect did not extend 
to satisfaction. Ivancevich and Donnelley&rsquo;s (1975) study of salespersons found that 
working in an organization with a steeper hierarchy was related to being less satis-
fied and experiencing more anxiety and stress than working for a flatter organiza-
tion. Again, studies of discrepancies in pay across employees show similar results 
for attitude-related outcomes (Bloom and Michel 2002; Pfeffer and Langton 1993; 
Trevor and Wazeter 2006; Wade et al. 2006). In sum, therefore, there is an abun-
dance of evidence that status hierarchies can lead to worse group outcomes rather 
than better.
</p>
<p>A Bounded Functionalist Account of Status
</p>
<p>The above-reviewed body of research suggests that the links between status hierar-
chies and group welfare are complex. On the one hand, many studies support basic 
claims espoused by functionalists, suggesting that status differences can facilitate 
collective decision making, encourage costly contributions to group efforts, and co-
ordinate group members&rsquo; behavior. On the other hand, many studies portray status 
hierarchies as dysfunctional, placing the wrong individuals in high-status positions, 
basing influence on characteristics unrelated to actual competence, and dampening 
groups&rsquo; overall morale and productivity.
</p>
<p>What conclusions can be made from these contradictory findings? Should we 
eschew the functionalist view entirely? Some scholars believe so, arguing that sta-
tus hierarchies do not emerge to serve any social function and instead are mere by-
products of individual status striving and competition (Lee and Ofshe 1981; Mazur 
1985). According to this perspective, status differences emerge because individuals 
compete for status, and some win these contests while others lose. The bases upon 
which rank is accorded are unrelated, or only loosely related, to individuals&rsquo; ability </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>593 Do Status Hierarchies Benefit Groups? A Bounded Functionalist Account of Status
</p>
<p>and willingness to benefit the group. The putative &ldquo;functions&rdquo; of hierarchies, such 
as reduced intragroup conflict and group member coordination are mere byproducts 
of resolved status contests. Once status competition has been decided, individual 
members tend to stop fighting (Bernstein 1981), and those higher in status take 
charge of allocating tasks and responsibilities.
</p>
<p>However, based on the available evidence, we believe it is inappropriate to throw 
out functionalism entirely. Instead, we propose that a more accurate way to view 
status hierarchies is from a bounded functionalist perspective. This perspective is 
akin to Simon&rsquo;s (1957) notion of bounded rationality, which argues that individu-
als are not perfectly rational in maximizing their utility, as classic economic theory 
might suggest. Rather, they are constrained in a number of ways, including cogni-
tive limitations and unavailable information. Individuals thus strive to make deci-
sions rationally, but fall short given these constraints.
</p>
<p>In a similar way, we believe group members generally intend to form functional 
hierarchies that will serve their goals effectively, but are limited in their ability to do 
so. Group members strive to place the individuals at the top of the status hierarchy 
who offer the most value to the group and to overcome problems of individual self-
interest by offering status as a reward for costly contributions that benefit the group. 
However, group members often fail to arrive at status hierarchies that serve the 
functions they are intended to, precisely because of factors cited by scholars critical 
of status inequalities. In the following section, we outline some basic ideas of this 
bounded functionalist perspective and discuss some of the obstacles groups face in 
developing functional status hierarchies. In doing so, we outline why bounded func-
tionalism might be the most accurate and useful view of status hierarchies.
</p>
<p>The Difficulty in Discerning Individual Merit
</p>
<p>Although groups might often allocate high status to people who are not the most 
competent or committed to the group&rsquo;s success, studies suggest that group members 
consistently strive to do so. As mentioned earlier, there tend to be very strong corre-
lations between individuals&rsquo; perceived competence and group orientation and their 
status in a group (e.g., Anderson and Kilduff 2009; Ridgeway 1982). That is, groups 
accord higher status to individuals they believe to be more expert or knowledgeable 
and to those they believe are committed to the group&rsquo;s success&mdash;even if in fact 
they often fail to allocate status to the people who actually are more competent or 
group-oriented. Similarly, when group members allocate greater status to individu-
als on the basis of factors like gender, race, and social class, they generally do so 
because they view these characteristics as markers of greater competence (Berger 
et al. 1972). Reliance on such characteristics often weighs more heavily on the 
group&rsquo;s status hierarchy than information on task-specific competence, leading to 
diminished group performance (e.g., Thomas-Hunt and Phillips 2004).
</p>
<p>Evidence also suggests that group members have negative views of individu-
als who try to grab status in the group, but who may not be the most competent or 
group-oriented (Keltner et al. 2008; Ridgeway and Diekema 1989). For example, in </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>60 C. Anderson and R. Willer
</p>
<p>a study by Ridgeway and Diekema (1989), confederates attempted to attain higher 
status in a group through aggression and domination and not necessarily well-rea-
soned ideas and arguments. Those confederates were met with strong resistance by 
their group and failed to attain status. Anderson et al. (2006) also found individuals 
who claimed higher status than their group believed they deserved were rejected 
and ostracized (see also Anderson et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>However, to successfully allocate status to those who are actually the most com-
petent or group-oriented, groups must be able to discern those characteristics accu-
rately in each individual member. As prior work has shown, this process is quite dif-
ficult. Individuals&rsquo; levels of competence and group-orientation reside within them, 
hidden from others. In most group settings, there is little objective evidence of how 
talented or prosocial an individual is. Groups are thus forced to judge individuals&rsquo; 
inner characteristics based on external observable cues such as outward appearance, 
nonverbal behavior, or style of speaking.
</p>
<p>Take competence for example. As discussed earlier, groups use static character-
istics such as gender, race, age, and physical attractiveness as cues of competence, 
even when those characteristics are wholly unrelated to actual knowledge or ability 
(e.g., Berger et al. 1972, 1980; Ridgeway et al. 1998; Thomas-Hunt and Phillips 
2004). In addition, group members tend to use nonverbal behaviors to infer com-
petence, such as whether the person uses more certain vocal tone (Driskell et al. 
1993; Paulhus and Morgan 1997; Ridgeway 1987), speaks more often and in a 
fluid and assertive way (Carli et al. 1995; Driskell et al. 1993; Paulhus and Morgan 
1997; Reynolds and Gifford 2001; Ridgeway 1987), speaks in a lower vocal pitch 
(Klofstad et al. 2012), uses more direct eye contact (Driskell et al. 1993; Imada and 
Hakel 1977; Mehrabian and Williams 1969; Ridgway 1987), and exhibits a relaxed 
and expansive posture (Carli et al. 1995; Imada and Hakel 1977; Ridgeway 1987). 
These behaviors, however, may not be related to actual competence either (e.g., 
Anderson et al. 2012). Thus, in trying to accurately discern individual competence, 
groups frequently misuse the cues available to them, thereby contributing to mis-
alignment between merit and status.
</p>
<p>In sum, the opacity of inner individual characteristics leads groups to sometimes 
accord high status to the wrong members. This misallocation of status likely helps 
explain the weak linkage between merit and status observed in many groups. More-
over, it might also help explain why steeper hierarchies often predict worse group 
outcomes. After all, if incompetent individuals are given a particularly disproportion-
ate level of control in a group, one would expect that group to fare particularly poorly.
</p>
<p>Individual Desire for Status
</p>
<p>An additional obstacle to functional hierarchies is the human desire for status. Sta-
tus strivings lead people to engage in a range of goal-oriented behaviors aimed at 
attaining and maintaining high status in their groups. Many of these behaviors can 
help promote group welfare, as described above; for example, the desire for status 
can spur prosocial behavior and contributions to the collective (e.g., Griskevicius </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>613 Do Status Hierarchies Benefit Groups? A Bounded Functionalist Account of Status
</p>
<p>et al. 2010; Sutton and Hargadon 1996). At the same time, however, the desire for 
status can lead individuals to behave in ways that hamper group success. As many 
scholars have argued, humans have a powerful drive for status and the rewards 
it brings (Barkow 1975; Frank 1985; Hogan 1983; Lind and Tyler 1988; Maslow 
1943). It appears that this strong motive can lead not only to prosocial acts but also 
self-interested, even antisocial, behavior.
</p>
<p>For example, evidence suggests individuals take advantage of groups&rsquo; reliance 
on external &ldquo;competence cues&rdquo; by behaving in ways that make them appear more 
competent or committed to the group&rsquo;s success than they actually are. The self-
presentation and impression management literatures have widely documented the 
tendency to &ldquo;self-promote&rdquo; or signal one&rsquo;s competence to others (for reviews, see 
Baumeister 1982; Leary and Kowalski 1990; Schlenker 2012). People tend to pub-
licly portray their competence in disproportionately positive ways, highlight their 
abilities and downplay weaknesses, and take credit for successes while blaming 
others for failure (Baumeister 1982). People also often defend past failed decisions, 
and even invest further in those decisions, rather than admit error (e.g., Staw 1976; 
Tetlock 2005).
</p>
<p>The desire for status also appears to promote competitive behavior that is un-
helpful to groups. For example, in a study by Godfrey et al. (1986), individuals 
trying to appear more competent avoided behaving positively toward others. Blau 
(1964) as well as Flynn et al. (2006) found that the desire for status led individuals 
to avoid asking others for help and assistance, requests that would be good for the 
group, but which individuals believe have the effect of granting higher status to 
others (Blau 1964; Flynn 2003; Flynn et al. 2006). Moreover, seeking help risks ex-
posing one&rsquo;s own incompetence. As Tessler and Schwartz (1972) found, individuals 
were hesitant to seek help when failing on a laboratory task, except when they could 
blame their failure on external causes&mdash;thereby avoiding attributions of incompe-
tence. The desire for status might also prevent people from agreeing with others&rsquo; 
opinions, regardless of the strength of that person&rsquo;s argument (for a review, see Bau-
meister 1982). Therefore, the individual drive for higher status can diminish a range 
of interpersonal behaviors that would help the group, such as expressing positivity 
toward others, asking for help, and agreeing with and supporting valid ideas.
</p>
<p>Some evidence suggests that people sometimes undermine others in pursuit of 
status, thereby harming relationships between individual group members. Kyl-
Heku and Buss (1996) found that people exclude and derogate others in order to get 
ahead. Much research suggests that status motives can even drive aggressive behav-
ior toward others deemed a threat (Borden 1975; Cohen et al. 1996; Griskevicius 
et al. 2009; Miller 2001). Research on Tesser&rsquo;s Self-Evaluation Maintenance model 
suggests people specifically undermine the performance of others who pose more 
of a status threat (Tesser and Smith 1980), and even distort others&rsquo; performance 
downward (Tesser et al. 1984). Kilduff&rsquo;s work shows that people resort to unethical 
and cheating tactics to beat rivals who challenge their status (Kilduff et al. 2012).
</p>
<p>In sum, the empirical evidence suggests that the human desire for status might 
impede the formation of merit-based hierarchies. While the lure of status can 
promote many behaviors that facilitate collective success, it also seems to promote </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>62 C. Anderson and R. Willer
</p>
<p>a host of behaviors that can dampen group functioning. Individuals seeking status 
often behave in ways that make them appear more competent or group-oriented than 
they actually are, they avoid interactions with others that might boost others&rsquo; status, 
and they even can derogate others and act hostilely toward them.
</p>
<p>Summary and Discussion
</p>
<p>The evidence reviewed in this section suggests that while groups strive to form 
functionalist status hierarchies, they are constrained in their ability to do so by con-
siderable obstacles. For example, while groups strive to base status differences on 
individual differences in merit, they are limited by the opacity of individuals&rsquo; inner 
characteristics. It is quite difficult to know which individuals are more competent or 
group-oriented than others, and therefore groups make mistakes in allocating status 
across individuals. To make matters more complicated, group members&rsquo; efforts to 
reward competence and group orientation create rewards for those individuals who 
can effectively feign these characteristics, leading them to jockey for status by mak-
ing themselves appear more talented or group-oriented than they actually are. In 
fact, the individual desire for status appears to promote many behaviors that work 
against the putative functions of status hierarchies.
</p>
<p>The bounded functionalist view suggests potentially fruitful avenues for future 
research. For example, future work could study which factors affect the degree to 
which group hierarchies are functional for the group. Based on the above review, we 
might expect hierarchies to benefit the group most when group members&rsquo; relevant 
skills are more visible, the distribution of relevant abilities is unequal, and where 
group coordination is especially important, e.g., where group activities are highly 
interdependent (e.g., Halevy et al. 2013). Conversely, status hierarchies will likely 
be less beneficial, or even dysfunctional, in groups where task-relevant skills are 
unknown, difficult to perceive, or easy to feign, where relevant abilities are equally 
distributed, where status ambitions and task competence are negatively or uncor-
related across the group membership, and where group performance depends on 
eliciting high levels of participation from all group members.
</p>
<p>Future research could also investigate various empirical implications of this 
bounded functionalist view. For example, our model may help explain why even 
very flawed status hierarchies are often stable and legitimate. Because group mem-
bers largely intend to assign status on the basis of real merit, inaccuracies in the 
status hierarchy are largely invisible to them. Further, while many bases of status 
are generally unrelated to competence or group commitment (e.g., gender, race, 
dominance), other bases of status are relevant (e.g., specific skills, training, proven 
willingness to help the group), meaning that status hierarchies will often be &ldquo;semi-
functional.&rdquo; Hierarchies based on a mix of factors relevant and irrelevant to indi-
vidual merit likely results in hierarchies that are positively, if imperfectly, correlated 
with individuals&rsquo; value to the group. Such a positive correlation may be enough to 
create the impression that a given hierarchy is working to benefit the group, cloak-
ing their imperfections, and helping them persist over time.</p>

<p>633 Do Status Hierarchies Benefit Groups? A Bounded Functionalist Account of Status
</p>
<p>Conclusion
</p>
<p>In trying to understand the ubiquity of status differences in human groups, many 
theorists have adopted the functionalist view that status helps social groups solve 
some of their most important problems. Much empirical evidence supports this 
perspective, showing that status facilitates collective decision making, encourages 
individual contributions to the group, and coordinates diverse members&rsquo; behaviors. 
At the same time, however, much evidence also demonstrates that status hierarchies 
can undermine group functioning.
</p>
<p>To synthesize these seemingly contradictory findings, we proposed a bounded 
functionalist view of status. According to this view, group members intend to al-
locate status in a way that encourages effective group functioning. However, groups 
are constrained in their ability to do so by a number of limitations and obstacles. 
These obstacles help explain why hierarchies are often not strongly related to merit, 
and why groups with larger status differences among members can outperform hier-
archical groups with larger status differences among members: if less competent but 
highly self-interested individuals attain high status and others have far lower status, 
the group will likely fare worse overall.
</p>
<p>This perspective is meant to provide an alternative to strictly functionalist or 
strictly critical accounts of status hierarchies. That is, status differences do not ap-
pear wholly beneficial for groups as strong versions of functionalism might imply. 
At the same time, status differences do not appear to always assign status arbi-
trarily, foster undesirable intragroup competition, and undermine group functioning 
as critical accounts might imply. Instead, status hierarchies appear to emerge from a 
flawed process originating from largely group-oriented intentions. Groups strive to 
form status hierarchies based on competence and merit, which would help facilitate 
their overall success, but are simply limited in their ability to do so.

<p>This is an exciting time to be a researcher with a &ldquo;social status&rdquo; focus. Indeed, this 
book serves as a testament to the energy that currently surrounds the topic of social 
status (hereafter referred to simply as &ldquo;status&rdquo;). There is an enormous amount of ac-
tivity on the topic, with much of the most recent and innovative work coming from 
psychology researchers. These recent developments are rather intriguing in light of 
the fact that status is, by no means, a new topic. Discussions about status have quite 
a long history within the social sciences (particularly in anthropology and sociol-
ogy), consistent with the reality that status hierarchies emerge in all social settings 
and that status issues permeate social life (e.g., Anderson and Kilduff 2009; Blader 
and Chen 2012; Fiske 2010; Podolny 2005). Given these realities, why have psy-
chology researchers not historically paid more attention to status, and, moreover, 
why have related research areas such as organizational behavior and management 
not paid more attention to this truly fundamental issue?
</p>
<p>One possible factor might be cultural&mdash;some norms in the US, as well as in most 
Western countries, tend to proscribe the notion that individuals should (or even 
can) be rank-ordered on perceived levels of esteem and worthiness. Instead, norms 
maintain that everyone is unique and worthy&mdash;even if only in their own &ldquo;special&rdquo; 
way (Brewer and Chen 2007). This perspective is reflected in emerging work that 
shows the stigma attached to status striving (Kim and Pettit 2013). Another factor 
contributing to the lack of attention to status may be the interest in other hierarchical 
dimensions&mdash;power, in particular. That is, research has tended to focus on alternate 
ways of thinking about rank and hierarchy. Of course, it may well be that the flurry 
of work on the psychology of power has sparked recent interest in related concepts, 
and status research may be a beneficiary of that trend.
</p>
<p>A third likely contributing factor&mdash;one that serves as a critical basis for this chap-
ter&mdash;is that there has historically been relatively weak conceptual clarity around </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>72 S. L. Blader and Y.-R. Chen
</p>
<p>status and its distinction from other dimensions of hierarchy. Researchers have been 
inconsistent in defining status, often equating it with power, influence, dominance, 
prestige, and rank, to name a few. Confusion with other hierarchy-related notions 
may have stymied the development of a distinct literature on status. With no con-
sensus about exactly what status is, it has not been possible for a progression of 
research on status in which new findings develop on the shoulders of prior findings. 
Note that this is not simply a measurement or methodological issue, although it cer-
tainly affects those. Rather, questions about how to best conceptualize status&mdash;and 
whether/how to distinguish it from related constructs&mdash;are high-level issues that lie 
at the heart of any future theorizing about status. We argue that this is a major issue 
for status researchers&mdash;the field&rsquo;s impact will be seriously limited if consensus is 
not reached about these issues. Such consensus is critical to the legitimacy and the 
development of the field.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, we recognize a trend toward greater consensus around the appropri-
ate and distinct conceptualization of status. We believe that this trend, which we will 
elaborate on below, has partially paved the way for the current surge of research 
on status. More importantly, current research builds on recent findings rather than 
ignoring or dismissing them, as has historically been the case with a great deal of 
status research. We hasten to add, however, that the trend toward greater consen-
sus about how to conceptualize status is at a nascent stage; in fact, many remain 
skeptical not only about this emerging definition but also, more crucially, about 
whether status is distinguishable from other terms used to describe social hierarchy. 
Indeed, there may well be more skeptics than believers at this point. As with any 
such tensions in the literature, this equates to both an opportunity and a challenge. 
Convincing those skeptics should be a primary goal for status scholars, as it will 
bring broader recognition of the legitimacy of social status as a construct in its own 
right. This will, in turn, not only advance the study of status but will also facilitate 
integration of the insights of status research into other domains.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we explore in depth the conceptualization of status&mdash;and its dis-
tinction from related dimensions of social hierarchy. We outline what we regard as 
the current thinking about how to conceptualize status and how this conceptualiza-
tion distinguishes status from related constructs. We focus largely on presenting em-
pirical evidence that tests and supports these distinctions. Moreover, we will present 
a framework that organizes the many related, yet distinct constructs that describe 
social hierarchy. As we present this material, we feel it is important to also grapple 
with a fundamental question: Why does distinguishing status from these related 
aspects of social hierarchy matter&mdash;both for research and for a better understanding 
of social life?
</p>
<p>Before jumping in, we feel it is worth taking a moment to expand on that last point 
and to explain why we place such importance on efforts to distinguish status from 
related constructs. To do so, we borrow an example from a different research area, 
namely research on the psychology of justice. Early justice research was squarely 
focused on distributive justice&mdash;on the finding that people are concerned about the 
perceived fairness of the outcomes they receive (Walster et al. 1978). An extraor-
dinary amount of research was conducted around this fundamental insight about </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>734 What&rsquo;s in a Name? Status, Power, and Other Forms of Social Hierarchy
</p>
<p> distributive justice. As that work progressed, an intriguing finding emerged&mdash;people  
seemed to care not only about the fairness of their outcomes but also about the 
fairness of how those outcomes were decided and implemented (Lind and Tyler 
1988; Thibaut and Walker 1975). This is the concept of procedural justice. This 
finding sparked a debate&mdash;was procedural justice really a distinct form of justice, or 
was it merely an elaboration on what was already known about distributive justice? 
(Tyler et al. 1997). Initial arguments attributed concerns over procedural justice 
to the instrumentality that procedures have for achieving preferred (i.e., fair) out-
comes (Thibaut and Walker 1975). This reasoning essentially argues that procedural 
justice is simply part of the story about people&rsquo;s concerns over outcomes and, in 
particular, over distributive justice. Therefore, this line of reasoning argues against 
the distinctiveness of procedural justice and diminishes its value as a concept in its 
own right. While processes and outcomes can be defined differently, the difference 
between them does not matter because they are inextricably related to one another 
and because they are both rooted in the same fundamental concern (an instrumental 
concern over outcomes).
</p>
<p>As many readers likely know, this was not the end of the story for procedural 
justice research. A subset of justice researchers pursued the notion that procedural 
justice is, in fact, distinct from distributive justice and that the emphasis people 
place on processes represents a different set of underlying concerns (Lind and Tyler 
1988; Tyler et al. 1998). Those researchers emphasized that while procedural justice 
and distributive justice may covary, covariation should not be taken to indicate that 
they represent the same psychological dynamics; nor should it be interpreted as 
meaning that their distinction is not worthwhile. Early on, this was a provocative 
stance in a literature that had been developed entirely around the preeminence of 
distributive justice. Skepticism was widespread. Yet, through persistent and com-
pelling empirical demonstrations, it became clear that procedural justice does, in-
deed, represent a concept distinct from distributive justice and, moreover, that the 
distinction is a notable one. Indeed, efforts to distinguish procedural justice have 
fundamentally impacted our understanding of what people seek from their groups 
(Blader and Tyler 2009, in press; Tyler and Blader 2000, 2002), emphasizing that 
they are seeking more than favorable or fair outcomes. In other words, researchers, 
who pushed forward and pursued the initially unpopular idea that procedural justice 
is distinct facilitated the development of a different model of the psychology of 
group membership.
</p>
<p>The lesson from the trajectory of procedural justice research should inform 
current discussions about the distinctiveness of status from other dimensions of 
social hierarchy. Indeed, in many respects, it seems that we are embarking on 
a similar path, given the emerging but limited evidence that status is a distinct 
construct and the presence of many skeptics to this argument. Yet, the lesson of 
procedural justice research clearly indicates that it is important to pursue such 
questions since they can bear important fruit and, indeed, can even fundamentally 
alter our understanding of the psychology of social hierarchy. With this histori-
cal case analysis in mind, we now turn our attention to the question of how we 
conceptualize status.</p>

</p>
<p>What is Status? And How Does It Differ From Other 
</p>
<p>Dimensions of Social Hierarchy?
</p>
<p>The emerging consensus among many status researchers is to define social status 
as the prestige, respect, and esteem that a party has in the eyes of others (Anderson 
and Kilduff 2009; Blader and Chen 2012; Fiske 2010; Fiske and Berdahl 2007; 
see also Henrich and Gil-White 2001; Goldhamer and Shils 1939; Ridgeway 2001; 
Ridgeway and Walker 1995; Zelditch 1968). Status is an index of the social worth 
that observers ascribe to an individual or a group (Chen et al. 2012), and, as such, it 
is the outcome of observers&rsquo; subjective evaluative process, which constitutes a criti-
cal part of the status conferral process (Ridgeway and Erickson 2000). As a result, 
status is wholly reliant on the views of these observers&mdash;individuals cannot have 
status if others do not regard them as high status. Status does not speak directly to 
the particular basis of evaluation, and, indeed, across contexts and across individu-
als, the basis for respect and esteem may vary dramatically. In some cases, status 
may emanate from competence, while in other cases, it may emanate from demo-
graphic characteristics such as race, age, and gender (Berger et al. 1972). Or it can 
be simultaneously determined by multiple factors, including these factors as well as 
others. Regardless, status refers to the evaluation of where a given target stands with 
regard to whatever the bases of respect or esteem may be.
</p>
<p>This definition makes clear how social status relates to (and, in most cases, 
differs from) other dimensions of social hierarchy, such as power, socioeconomic 
status (SES), dominance, prestige, influence, and leadership. All of these are dimen-
sions for rank-ordering actors in a given social context, but we argue that each is 
distinct from the others and, moreover, that each has some distinction from status. 
In particular, power refers to control over critical resources&mdash;i.e., outcome control 
(D&eacute;pret and Fiske 1993; Fiske 2010; Galinsky et al. 2003; Georgesen and Harris 
1998, 2000; Gruenfeld et al. 2008; Keltner et al. 2003; Overbeck and Park 2001). 
Socioeconomic status (SES) refers to an individual&rsquo;s (or a family&rsquo;s) social posi-
tion in relation to others, based on wealth, education, and occupation (Kraus and 
Keltner 2009). Dominance and prestige have been described in various ways. Hen-
rich and Gil-White (2001) describe dominance as those approaches to achieving 
high social rank that are characterized by induction of fear in others (for instance, 
through aggression, coercion, and withholding resources). Prestige, in contrast, re-
fers to approaches to achieving high social rank that are characterized by gaining 
respect from others for one&rsquo;s skills and competence, particularly when these help 
achieve collective goals (Henrich and Gil-White 2001). Prestige is, perhaps, the 
social hierarchical dimension most closely tied to status, and some researchers have 
explicitly described the two constructs as equivalent (Cheng et al. 2013); we more 
fully consider this issue later in this chapter. Finally, influence refers to the ability 
to shape and alter others&rsquo; views and/or behavior. As we discuss in more detail later 
in the chapter, we subscribe to the view that it is critical to recognize influence as 
a downstream consequence of any of these social hierarchy-related constructs. In-
deed, individuals may have influence, but that does not tell us whether they are seen </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>754 What&rsquo;s in a Name? Status, Power, and Other Forms of Social Hierarchy
</p>
<p>as dominant, prestigious, or of high SES. They may also have the potential to wield 
influence but choose not to do so; this restraint does not diminish their dominance, 
prestige or SES (and, indeed, may help maintain it; Magee and Galinsky 2008). 
Moreover, sources of social influence are not restricted solely to hierarchy-related 
forces. For instance, the mere presence of another individual may lead them to have 
influence on a target without any regard to hierarchy (Zajonc 1965).
</p>
<p>Note that these have not always been the accepted definitions of these constructs 
and that many prior studies on &ldquo;status&rdquo; have actually been&mdash;according to these 
definitions&mdash;about one or another of these alternate dimensions of social hierarchy. 
For instance, some prior studies about &ldquo;status&rdquo; have actually either manipulated or 
measured what we refer to above as power, with much of that work describing the 
concepts of status and power interchangeably (e.g., Brewer and Brown 1998). Other 
studies about &ldquo;status&rdquo; have actually manipulated or measured what we refer to as 
influence. Thus, it is important to examine the details of prior work&mdash;the precise 
measures used, manipulations implemented, etc.&mdash;to figure out which construct is 
the true focus of the work. We cannot emphasize this point enough. Prior work that 
is ostensibly about status, but that manipulates status as resource control or hierar-
chical position, may well find different results than studies that manipulate status 
as esteem or social regard. This, in turn, can make it seem as if status does not have 
reliable effects on outcome variables when, in fact, it is the inconsistency in the 
operationalization of status that drives those differences.
</p>
<p>The importance of definitions and conceptual precision is reflected in a question/
critique that we often encounter when discussing status as a distinct social hierarchi-
cal dimension. In particular, it is often noted that the distinction between status and 
power is already addressed by French and Raven&rsquo;s (1959) taxonomy of the bases 
of power. In particular, as described in that taxonomy, referent power seems to map 
on to our conceptualization of status. This suggests that status is simply a basis for 
power&mdash;that it is not a distinct hierarchical dimension but, rather, a pathway to being 
highly ranked on the power dimension. Yet, if we use the definitions provided above 
to reflect on French and Raven&rsquo;s seminal theorizing, we have a new lens through 
which we can understand this foundational work. In particular, the French and Ra-
ven theorizing is best described as analyzing the bases of potential for influence, not 
power per se. Their work equates the two constructs. Yet, like others, we feel that it 
is critical to unpack influence and to describe it as an outcome of several possible so-
cial hierarchical dimensions. When we apply our perspective to French and Raven&rsquo;s 
theorizing about the bases of influence, it becomes clear that their work actually rep-
resents one of the earliest efforts to stress the importance of distinguishing between 
social hierarchical dimensions. Indeed, the various bases they outline may be con-
strued as presenting a rather granular understanding of the various social hierarchi-
cal dimensions we describe above. For instance, our definition of power as resource 
control is reflected in a more fine-grained manner by French and Raven&rsquo;s (1959) 
articulation of coercive, reward, and expert bases. We regard this early work as quite 
consistent with our efforts to distinguish between status and power, though confu-
sion around definitions and terminology may superficially obscure that consistency.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>76 S. L. Blader and Y.-R. Chen
</p>
<p>One common argument&mdash;even among those who accept the distinct definitions 
of the dimensions of social hierarchy listed above&mdash;is that while distinctions can be 
drawn, those distinctions are not meaningful. According to this perspective, because 
covariation among these distinctions is very strong&mdash;e.g., status invariably leads to 
power, or vice-versa&mdash;the distinctions are not worth making. In other words, status 
and power are so tightly coupled that distinguishing them is an esoteric academic 
task, not an exercise that will shed light on real-world issues or problems. We firmly 
disagree with this perspective. First, as already discussed, if this same logic were 
applied to other research areas, critical insights would have been missed. This is a 
primary lesson from the history of procedural justice research. The legitimacy and 
insights of these areas would have been undermined by assuming that covariation is 
absolute and tantamount to an inability to disentangle two discrete concepts.
</p>
<p>Second, when it comes to the various dimensions of social hierarchy, the strength 
of the covariation should not be overstated. The dimensions are distinct, and there 
are many cases of &ldquo;off-diagonals&rdquo;&mdash;e.g., individuals who wield power (or are of 
high SES) but have little status or individuals who have great status but little power 
(or are of low SES). Most people can all too easily think of supervisors or group au-
thorities who hold tremendous resource control but who are not highly regarded by 
their subordinates and others with whom they interact. This same tension between 
possessing power in the absence of status is often seen in certain roles, such as 
the oft-noted Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) employees and airport security 
(TSA) agents (e.g., Fast et al. 2012). Conversely, highly regarded supervisors or 
group authorities may have a very limited budget and a small group of subordinates 
under their supervision and control.
</p>
<p>Armed with these definitions of the various dimensions of social hierarchy&mdash;
as well as an understanding of the importance of distinguishing among them&mdash;we 
will consider empirical evidence that supports these distinctions. Our primary focus 
will be on empirical work that distinguishes between status and power. Given the 
predominance of work on the psychology of power, this is a particularly important 
distinction to draw in arguing for distinct consideration of status. Moreover, power 
is the dimension with which status is most often conflated. The empirical work we 
will discuss focuses on showing that status and power exert different effects on 
cognition and behavior. We will also briefly consider the distinction between domi-
nance and prestige, an issue we more fully explore in the following section, where 
we posit a model for organizing all these various dimensions of hierarchy. Through-
out, it is important to note that our interest is in examining the effects of one&rsquo;s sense 
of one&rsquo;s own status and/or power (or other basis of social hierarchy). Therefore, our 
attention is not on structural or objective dimensions of social hierarchy, but, rather, 
on individuals&rsquo; awareness and perception of where they stand on these dimensions. 
This is, of course, consistent with the focus of this entire volume on the psychologi-
cal experience of status.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>774 What&rsquo;s in a Name? Status, Power, and Other Forms of Social Hierarchy
</p>
<p>Comparing Status versus Power
</p>
<p>Although status and power are often confused with one another, individuals derive, 
experience, and utilize them differently. This insight is not new (see Emerson 1962; 
Fiske 2010; Goldhamer and Shils 1939; Hall et al. 2005; Henrich and Gil-White 
2001; Ridgeway 2001; Ridgeway and Walker 1995; Sachdev and Bourhis 1985). 
However, empirical work testing this insight is generally lacking, which may ex-
plain why consensus about their distinction remains elusive.
</p>
<p>One critical difference between status and power is that status, relative to power, 
is more reliant on the judgments and evaluations of others. It relies more on a con-
ferral process, as discussed earlier. Therefore, power is relatively more of a property 
of the actor (i.e., the power-holder), while status is relatively more of a property of 
co-actors and observers (Fragale et al. 2011; Magee and Galinsky 2008). That is not 
to say that power is wholly independent of co-actors and observers; if others do not 
agree that a target has power, they will not engage in acts&mdash;such as deference&mdash;that 
can be important in reinforcing the target&rsquo;s power position. Moreover, others may 
challenge the value of the resource that the power-holder target controls, again giv-
ing co-actors and observers a significant role even in power dynamics. Yet, these 
are relatively more distal influences on power conferral since they are indirect. That 
is, they rely on cases where lack of deference will actually diminish one&rsquo;s power 
position, or where alternate resources enable challenges to the value of a power-
holder&rsquo;s resources. Status conferral, in contrast, involves a more direct role for co-
actors and observers. Moreover, while there are means by which power-holders can 
compensate for lack of power conferral from their interaction partners, there are no 
such substitutes when it comes to status. If interaction partners and observers do not 
bestow status on a target, then that target does not have status. This differentiation 
is reflected in power and status dynamics among national leaders: Countries&rsquo; presi-
dents can build and maintain power through the infusion of financial or military 
support from foreign countries, but they must rely on the views of their own people 
in order to build and maintain high status among their constituents.
</p>
<p>We argue that this critical difference between status and power can be the source 
of important differences in how they affect those possessing each of these bases of 
social hierarchy. For instance, since status relies on others, concerns about main-
taining one&rsquo;s status will orient status-holders outward, as they will be focused on 
monitoring where they stand vis-&agrave;-vis the status-conferral process. That is, status 
concerns may orient individuals to focus on their interaction partners and other indi-
viduals in their environment (Blader and Chen 2012; Blader et al. 2013; Flynn et al. 
2006). This would be due to a concern over the status-conferral process (Blau 1964; 
Emerson 1962; Homans 1961; Magee and Galinsky 2008; Ridgeway and Erickson 
2000) and, in particular, the conferral of respect and esteem (Blau 1964; Fragale 
et al. 2011; Henrich and Gil-White 2001; Van Vugt et al. 2008). This concern is par-
ticularly well founded since findings from a variety of research streams suggest that 
high status and, more generally, highly prominent parties may receive more atten-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>78 S. L. Blader and Y.-R. Chen
</p>
<p>tion and scrutiny from those with less status or prominence (e.g., Anderson and Shi-
rako 2008; Graffin et al. 2013). As such, high-status parties (who presumably wish 
to maintain their high-status position) will not only be vigilant about monitoring 
status-conferral processes but will also be particularly vigilant about maintaining 
social relations in a manner that prompts continued respect and esteem from others. 
That is, they will strive to fulfill others&rsquo; expectations that high-status parties show 
consideration and act in a manner that warrants their high-status position (Blader 
and Chen 2012; Ridgeway 1978, 1982).
</p>
<p>Note that this is consistent with arguments from several streams of status re-
search. For instance, consider that feelings of respect and pride&mdash;feelings that ac-
company holding a higher-status position and that are &ldquo;highly socially defined&rdquo; 
(and thus depend on others)&mdash;can lead to increased attention to and understanding 
of others. This is because increased attention to others can help perpetuate others&rsquo; 
admiration and conferral of status to the high-status individual (Cheng et al. 2010: 
Henrich and Gil-White 2001). Critical, however, is the point that status-mainte-
nance concerns prompt high-status parties not only to be oriented and attentive 
toward social targets but also to act in ways that these targets find respectable and 
commendable. Consider, for example, findings that those who achieve higher sta-
tus in a group actually escalate their generosity to the group once they achieve a 
higher-ranked position (Willer 2009). Rather than selfishly reaping the benefits that 
come with their elevated position and thus reducing their contributions, they instead 
increase their contributions. While this increase may result from an enhanced sense 
of connectedness to the group after achieving a high-status position, it may also be 
due to a concern with maintaining one&rsquo;s position since this heightened generosity 
may help ensure that the high-status individual continues to be respected and held 
in high esteem.
</p>
<p>This description of the effects of status stands in stark contrast to the effects 
of power, which liberates people from social and normative pressures and enables 
them to shift their focus inward, toward their own goals and dispositions (Galinsky 
et al. 2008; Guinote 2007; Keltner et al. 2003). Indeed, power can prompt an ego-
centric orientation to social encounters (Fiske 2010; Galinsky et al. 2006; Lee and 
Tiedens 2001). As such, power makes people less attentive to and concerned about 
others (Galinsky et al. 2006) and thus may also make them less concerned about 
others&rsquo; impressions of them.
</p>
<p>Several recent studies have tested this fundamental argument, exploring whether 
status and power have differential effects on a) attentiveness toward others and b) 
behavior toward others that reflects a concern for how others will view the status- 
versus the power-holder. We consider these lines of research below, focusing on the 
emerging story they tell about the dynamics of status and power.
</p>
<p>Status, Power, and Perspective Taking In one recent line of work, Blader et al. 
(2013) compared the effects of status and power on perspective taking. Perspec-
tive taking&mdash;the ability to take others&rsquo; vantage point and to understand their feel-
ings, concerns, and perceptions&mdash;is a rather direct index of attentiveness toward 
others. Thus, these studies provide an ideal test of the argument that status and 
power prompt differential attentiveness toward others. Moreover, prior research has </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>794 What&rsquo;s in a Name? Status, Power, and Other Forms of Social Hierarchy
</p>
<p>demonstrated that power is negatively associated with perspective taking (Galinsky 
et al. 2006; Lammers et al. 2008a; Tjosvold and Sagaria 1978). This is because, as 
described earlier, increased power creates a heightened egocentric focus (cf. Over-
beck and Park 2001, 2006). This diminishes the likelihood that high-power parties 
will adopt others&rsquo; perspectives.
</p>
<p>Blader et al. (2013) sought to examine whether status has the opposite effect of 
power on perspective taking and, in particular, whether status actually increases 
perspective taking. Their reasoning was based on the argument outlined above, 
which indicates that status will prompt an outward focus (i.e., a focus on others) in 
contrast to power&rsquo;s tendency to prompt inward focus (i.e., a focus on the self). In 
particular, they argued that status-holders try to cultivate social relations in a man-
ner that prompts continued respect and esteem from others. This relational focus 
requires that status-holders focus on others and that they fulfill others&rsquo; expectations 
that high-status parties show consideration and act in a manner consistent with one 
holding high status (Blader and Chen 2012; Ridgeway 1978, 1982; Willer 2009). 
Perspective taking is inherent in this process since it facilitates understanding oth-
ers, monitoring others&rsquo; reactions, and anticipating what others will regard as re-
spectable. Note how this stands in contrast to high-power parties&rsquo; egocentric focus. 
Moreover, it also contrasts with those possessing a low-status position, who may be 
relatively less concerned about social relations in general or who may be relatively 
more focused on efforts to achieve status. Both of these characteristics of low-status 
parties would prompt them to have a relatively reduced focus on perspective taking 
(as compared with their high-status counterparts). This latter point warrants further 
explanation: Prior research has emphasized that low-status parties striving to attain 
status will be relatively more focused on demonstrating competence and value to 
the collective (Anderson and Kilduff 2009; Magee and Galinsky 2008), rather than 
on understanding and showing consideration for others. As such, high-status parties 
should be more likely to perspective-take as compared to both their high-power and 
their low-status counterparts.
</p>
<p>The results across four studies provided strong support for these predictions 
about the effects of status versus power on perspective taking. One of their studies 
that provides a clear illustration of these effects was based on prior perspective-
taking research (Todd et al. 2011; Tversky and Hard 2009), in which participants 
were provided a photograph of a scene that included an individual seated at a table, 
with a book located off to one side of the table. The key dependent variable in this 
study asked participants to report which side of the table the book is on. This was an 
index of perspective taking since participants spontaneously adopting the perspec-
tive of the individual in the photograph would describe the position of the object 
from that individual&rsquo;s perspective (e.g., &ldquo;to the person&rsquo;s left&rdquo;). In contrast, those 
who described the position of the object from their own perspective (e.g., &ldquo;to my 
right&rdquo;) were not adopting the target individual&rsquo;s perspective.
</p>
<p>Participants were randomly placed into one of five experimental conditions 
(high-status, high-power, low-status, low-power, and control). These conditions 
were manipulated using the recall paradigm that has been prevalent in recent power 
research (e.g., Galinsky et al. 2003, 2006). This paradigm cued participants to re-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>80 S. L. Blader and Y.-R. Chen
</p>
<p>call a prior incident in which they had high (or low) power or status and, in doing 
so, provided a way to instill a low- versus high-power or a low- versus high-status 
mindset. The results confirmed the preceding predictions about the differential ef-
fects of status and power on perspective taking. Replicating prior work (Galinsky 
et al. 2006), participants in the high-power condition were less likely than their 
counterparts in the control or low-power conditions to perspective take. More im-
portantly, the findings indicated that participants in the high-status condition were 
more likely to perspective take than their counterparts in the control or low-status 
conditions. In other words, high levels of status and power had opposite effects 
from one another on perspective taking (as compared to the control condition and to 
low levels of each of these dimensions of social hierarchy).
</p>
<p>These findings were corroborated by several other studies that detected the same 
pattern of effects of status and power on perspective taking. For instance, in another 
study in Blader et al. (2013), the same pattern was found for a different class of 
perspective taking&mdash;namely, affective perspective taking (often conceptualized as 
emotion recognition (Denham 1986; Galinsky et al. 2006; Gonzaga et al. 2008; 
Moeller et al. 2011). In this case, the researchers found that high status increased 
accuracy in reading others&rsquo; emotions, while high power had the precisely opposite 
effect. Overall, this set of studies provide initial support for the argument that the 
dynamics related to possessing high status spur a distinct psychology from those 
related to possessing high power, insofar as they appear to prompt differential at-
tentiveness toward others.
</p>
<p>Status, Power, and Justice Another recent series of studies (Blader and Chen 2012) 
tested an argument related to that tested in Blader et al. (2013). In particular, Blader 
and Chen (2012) examined the differential effects of status and power on justice 
enacted toward others. This represents an extension of the perspective- taking find-
ings just described since the enactment of justice toward others reflects not only 
perspective taking but also a concern for others and the impressions that one creates 
with others. That is, while perspective taking is a necessary part of the mechanism 
that underlies justice enactment (since justice enactment requires an understanding 
of the justice recipient&rsquo;s perspective), justice also involves a more general concern 
toward the other party and relations with the other party. It also represents a more 
behavioral outcome than perspective taking, enabling a more direct examination of 
the impact that status and power differences may have on social relations.
</p>
<p>Based on the same reasoning outlined above for how status-conferral processes 
prompt attentiveness toward others and a concern for how one is viewed by others, 
Blader and Chen (2012) tested whether possession of a high-status position was as-
sociated with greater justice enacted in an interpersonal interaction. Moreover, they 
reasoned that power would have the opposite effects on justice enactment and thus 
that power would be negatively related to justice enactment. This is because power-
holders are characterized by decreased attention toward others, less individuation, 
and less concern for others and for how others view them (Lammers et al. 2008b), 
all of which would diminish the likelihood of treating others fairly. These predic-
tions about the opposite effects of status and power on justice enactment were tested </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>814 What&rsquo;s in a Name? Status, Power, and Other Forms of Social Hierarchy
</p>
<p>in five experimental studies, covering a wide range of situations, forms of justice, 
and operationalizations of status and power.
</p>
<p>Blader and Chen&rsquo;s (2012) key findings about the differential effects of power and 
status on justice are exemplified in study 3 of their paper. That study had partici-
pants role-play a leader who was charged with the task of laying off one of their sub-
ordinates via a written memo. Participants received role descriptions that included 
the status and power manipulations (i.e., status: &ldquo;you are one of the most respected 
individuals in the company&rdquo;; power: &ldquo;you are personally given control over a great 
deal of the organization&rsquo;s resources&rdquo;; or neither&mdash;i.e., the control condition). While 
enacting their roles, participants wrote their layoff memos, which were subsequent-
ly coded by independent raters for the procedural justice of the memo. Moreover, 
participants completed measures indicating a) their concern about fairness with re-
gard to the memos and b) their general degree of attentiveness to the target.
</p>
<p>The results indicated strong support for differentiating status and power. Layoff 
memos written by those in the status condition were rated as significantly fairer 
than those written by participants in the control or power conditions; moreover, 
those in the power condition were rated as significantly less fair than those in the 
control condition. In addition, the same pattern of findings emerged with regard to 
participants&rsquo; self-reported focus on fairness and their general attentiveness to the 
target. Thus, both self-reported and behavioral indices demonstrated that high status 
made participants more concerned about the (fictitious) target affected by the layoff, 
while power had the opposite effect on concern about the target.
</p>
<p>Blader and Chen (2012) adopted a somewhat different approach in their study 
5, which orthogonally crossed power and status in a 2 (power: low, high) &times; 2 (sta-
tus: low, high) experimental design. This method enabled an examination not just 
of high power versus high status, but also of their main and interactive effects on 
procedural justice enacted toward others. Examination of the interactive effects be-
tween status and power explicitly put the distinction between the two to the test, as 
it orthogonally crossed these dimensions of social hierarchy with one another&mdash;and, 
in the process, provided insight into the psychology associated with each.
</p>
<p>This study utilized a negotiation role-playing paradigm, with status and power 
manipulated in the role materials provided to one negotiator. Procedural justice was 
rated by the other negotiator. As expected, there were positive main effects of status 
and negative main effects of power on procedural justice. This supports our general 
argument about the effect of status and power on other- and self-concern as re-
flected in justice enacted toward others. Moreover, there was an interaction between 
status and power, such that the positive effect of status did not emerge when power 
was high. This intriguing finding highlights the point that while status and power 
may well represent distinct constructs, it is important to consider their combined, 
interactive effects. We hasten to note, however, that the specific form that their in-
teraction may take will be highly context-dependent. In highly competitive contexts 
in which economic norms and concerns dominate (such as the negotiation context 
of the study just described), power may &ldquo;wash out&rdquo; the effects of status. In contrast, 
in contexts in which reputational and relational considerations carry more impor-
tance, status may &ldquo;wash out&rdquo; the effects of power. The pattern of interactive effects </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>82 S. L. Blader and Y.-R. Chen
</p>
<p>between status and power may likewise vary as a function of the bases of status and 
power, which are also highly variable across contexts.
</p>
<p>One additional element of the studies presented in Blader and Chen (2012) war-
rants discussion. Several of the studies explored whether dispositional measures of 
other-orientation (e.g., relational interdependent self-construal; empathic concern) 
moderated the effects of power on justice. These studies reasoned that disposition-
al bases of other-orientation would attenuate the tendency for power to be nega-
tively associated with fairness, arguing that those dispositions serve as bases for 
other-focus in much the same way that status serves as a situational basis for other-
orientation. This perspective is consistent with the emerging recognition that high 
power sets the stage for individual differences to exert more influence, liberating 
power-holders from normative pressures and situational constraints and enabling 
the self and one&rsquo;s traits to exert more influence on their behavior (Chen et al. 2001; 
Fiske and Berdahl 2007; Galinsky et al. 2008; Schmid Mast et al. 2009). Findings 
throughout Blader and Chen (2012) corroborate this general pattern, demonstrat-
ing that dispositional other-orientation moderates the effect of power. Among those 
high in dispositional other-orientation, high power produces effects on justice that 
more closely resemble the effects found in the high-status conditions. The similarity 
in effects between dispositional bases of other-orientation and the high-status con-
ditions supports our fundamental reasoning that status prompts other-orientation.
</p>
<p>An intriguing series of studies differentiates status and power in the context 
of justice dynamics from a different angle. In particular, Rothman et al. (2013) 
examined how an individual&rsquo;s enactment of justice or injustice shapes third par-
ties&rsquo; inferences of that individual&rsquo;s status or power. That is, this work examined 
the reverse causal dynamic as compared with the pattern examined in Blader and 
Chen&rsquo;s (2012) research. Their findings indicate that perceived justice has opposite 
effects on perceptions of status and power. In particular, they found that fairness is 
positively associated with status but negatively associated with power. Unfairness 
enhances perceived power because it is seen as an indication that the actor has little 
relational concern for others, and this lack of concern is interpreted as meaning that 
the actor must possess high power. In contrast, fairness enhances perceived status 
because it is seen as showing that the actor has high relational concern for others, a 
characteristic associated with being held in high esteem. This work reinforces the 
differentiation of status and power and, moreover, confirms that the effects of status 
and power on justice found in Blader and Chen (2012) are consistent with perceiv-
ers&rsquo; notions about how status, power, and justice interrelate.
</p>
<p>Status, Power, and Demeaning Behaviors Related research has looked at the other 
side of the coin, examining antisocial behaviors rather than prosocial behaviors 
such as justice. In particular, Fast et al. (2012) examined the interactive effects of 
status and power on demeaning behaviors toward others. Participants in this study 
were asked to select interpersonal behaviors for their counterparts in the experiment 
to perform; the key focus was on the number of demeaning behaviors (e.g., bark-
ing like a dog) that participants selected. Results indicated&mdash;as might be expected 
based on the power literature&mdash;that high-power participants selected more demean-
ing tasks for their counterparts. However, this was only true for those high-power </p>

</p>
<p>participants that had low status. High-status/high-power participants did not show 
this propensity, suggesting that their high status may have oriented them to be more 
considerate toward their counterparts. Note that this interaction pattern is somewhat 
different from that found in Blader and Chen (2012), where high power negated 
rather than enabled the positive consequences of status. This may be due to differ-
ences in the nature of the dependent variables (prosocial versus antisocial behavior) 
or the experimental paradigms. A great deal of additional research is needed to fully 
understand the interactive effects of status and power.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, Kuwabara (2013) used a very different paradigm but replicated the 
same general finding on a different type of negative behavior. This study examined, 
among other things, the extent of punishment (which is notably different from, but 
has some linkages to, demeaning behavior) meted out in public goods games as a 
function of both power and status. Consistent with the various studies discussed 
thus far, this study likewise found that power is positively associated with punish-
ment toward others. However, this effect was attenuated by high status, an effect 
that the author attributed to the relational focus spurred by status and, in particular, 
the heightened sensitivity to how one is viewed by others. As such, the results of 
this study provide converging support for the interactive effects of status and power 
reported in Fast et al. (2012). More generally, the interactive effects found in both 
studies (and others) attests to the distinct natures of status and power.
</p>
<p>Status, Power, and Social Judgment The studies we have cited thus far have dis-
tinguished status from power by examining their differential effects on those pos-
sessing them. Fragale et al. (2011) took a different approach, examining how status 
and power differentially impact the social judgments made by those evaluating 
status- and power-holders. In particular, they examined how a target&rsquo;s power and 
status impact observers&rsquo; judgments of that target&rsquo;s dominance and warmth. They 
presented participants with depictions of target individuals that signaled either role-
based or person-based power and status, and they asked participants to rate the 
targets on a variety of dominance and warmth-based traits. The results indicated that 
both power and status enhance perceived dominance. Power and status are, thus, 
not differentiable in terms of perceived dominance. However, participants indicated 
that power had a negative effect on warmth, but that this was attenuated when sta-
tus was high. To the extent that warmth is a reflection of relational dynamics and, 
in particular, perceived other-orientation, these results are intriguing because they 
indicate that observers&rsquo; reactions are quite consistent with the relational orienta-
tion taken by high-status individuals. That is, results discussed earlier show greater 
other-orientation among those possessing high status, while the Fragale et al. (2011) 
results (and, in some respects, the Rothman et al. (2013) results discussed above) 
show that observers regard those possessing high status as warmer and thus more 
other-oriented. As such, there is convergent evidence about the distinct effects of 
power and status in how individuals actually orient themselves toward others and in 
how they are perceived as orienting themselves toward others.
</p>
<p>Differential Preferences for Status and Power Still another approach to distinguish-
ing status and power is to examine differences in the factors that lead people to seek </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>84 S. L. Blader and Y.-R. Chen
</p>
<p>one or the other. A key example of such work is that by Hays (2013), who consid-
ered the role of gender in shaping the extent to which power versus status is desired 
and sought. Hays (2013) hypothesized that given gender differences in the need 
for power, affiliation, independence, and interdependence, men will desire power 
more than women. In contrast, women will desire status more than men. Results 
strongly confirmed these predictions. In all three studies, men desired power more 
than women did, and women desired status more than men did. In two of three stud-
ies, men desired power more than status, and in all three studies, women desired 
status more than power.
</p>
<p>Hays (2013) also explored a different issue with regard to preferences for status 
or power. Namely, he hypothesized about the role of legitimacy in preferences for 
power or status. He predicted that legitimacy would have a greater effect on the 
desirability of status (vs. power) since status is voluntarily conferred. His study 
3, which tested these predictions regarding legitimacy, confirmed that legitimacy 
significantly influenced the desirability of having status, whereas it had no effect on 
the desirability of having power.
</p>
<p>These findings provide additional support for the differences between power and 
status outlined above. Directly consistent with the argument that status leads to an 
outward orientation, Hays (2013) associated the preference for status with char-
acteristics such as high need for affiliation and high interdependence, traits more 
commonly found among women (who corresponding with the results of Fragale 
et al. (2011), are typically seen as having more warmth). Likewise, also directly 
consistent with our reasoning that power differs from status insofar as it prompts 
more of an inward (i.e., self-focused) orientation, Hays (2013) found that prefer-
ences for power are associated with characteristically male traits of high need for 
power and high independence. These findings show that the power and status differ-
ences of our focus emerge not only when people find themselves in either a highly 
ranked power or status position but that they also emerge with regard to the desire 
for power or status. That is, power and status are differentially attractive to people 
as a function of people&rsquo;s dispositional inward vs. outward orientation. These find-
ings serve as strong testament to our overall model of the fundamental differences 
between status and power&mdash;differences that we ascribe to the inherent outward ori-
entation that is prompted by the status-conferral process.
</p>
<p>Differential Effects of Status versus Power Hierarchies The final approach we con-
sider for examining differences between status and power is research that shows 
differential effects of status and power hierarchies on competition (Hays and Bend-
ersky 2013). This work takes the status-conferral process as its starting point and 
reasons that one consequence of the process is that status hierarchies are more 
mutable than power hierarchies. That is, since status is the result of an informal and 
continual conferral process, status hierarchies are more dynamic and more strongly 
impacted by the behaviors of those who are a part of the hierarchy. Hays and Bend-
ersky (2013) took this logic and developed an intriguing and somewhat counter-
intuitive insight from it: that the enhanced mutability of status hierarchies means 
that people will act more competitively in the context of those hierarchies than they 
will in the context of power hierarchies. In other words, opportunities for upward </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>854 What&rsquo;s in a Name? Status, Power, and Other Forms of Social Hierarchy
</p>
<p>mobility are greater in status hierarchies than in power hierarchies, and this leads 
individuals to be more competitive as they try to achieve upward mobility.
</p>
<p>Their work presented several empirical studies testing the differential effects of 
status vs. power hierarchies on competition and explored the mediating role of the 
hierarchy&rsquo;s perceived mutability. As a set, the studies provided compelling support 
for the authors&rsquo; argument that status hierarchies are perceived as more mutable than 
power hierarchies and that this leads individuals to engage in competitive behaviors 
that are dysfunctional for the group&rsquo;s goals. Overall, this work provides a rather 
different perspective on the status vs. power distinction since it takes as its starting 
point the observation that status is more interdependent, yet it finds that this can 
prompt more pro-self/less pro-social consequences.
</p>
<p>Prestige versus Dominance A dichotomy that is different from, but somewhat 
related to, the status vs. power dichotomy is the distinction between prestige and 
dominance. Henrich and Gil-White (2001) first articulated these concepts (defined 
above), describing them as two routes to attaining social status. Originally, this line 
of research used the term &ldquo;status&rdquo; to refer to what is essentially generalized influ-
ence or social rank. Subsequent work in this tradition clarified that point (Cheng 
et al. 2013), highlighting that what had originally been referred to as status was 
meant to refer to social rank and influence. Moreover, this subsequent work argued 
that prestige is conceptually analogous to the social psychological definition of 
status as respect and esteem (dominance, in contrast, is not seen as analogous to 
power; see Cheng et al.). Definitions and labels aside, this line of work highlights 
that prestige and dominance are two avenues to achieving high social rank. Since 
prestige is seen as equivalent to status, but dominance is not seen as equivalent to 
power, work that attempts to distinguish between prestige and dominance repre-
sents an interesting complement to the status vs. power research outlined above. 
Thus, we briefly consider some of the most recent work in this tradition, though we 
direct interested readers to Chap. 1 in this volume by Cheng and Tracy, which pro-
vides a more thorough treatment of the distinction between prestige and dominance.
</p>
<p>The key insights of this work are reflected in two sets of studies that empiri-
cally differentiate prestige from dominance. In one of these sets of studies, Cheng 
et al. (2010) differentiate between prestige and dominance by considering their as-
sociation with two distinct forms of pride. Hubristic pride refers to pride marked by 
feelings of arrogance and conceit, while authentic pride refers to pride marked by 
feelings of accomplishment, confidence, and success (Tracy and Robins 2004). Hu-
bristic pride is highly antisocial, whereas authentic pride is socially valued. Thus, 
Cheng et al. reasoned that if dominance and prestige were, in fact, distinct dimen-
sions of social hierarchy in the way that prior theorizing has predicted, then domi-
nance should be associated with hubristic pride and prestige with authentic pride. 
That is, hubristic pride should serve as the impetus for dominance-like behaviors, 
while authentic pride should motivate prestige-like behaviors. Their results pro-
vided strong support for these predictions. Indeed, their study went well beyond 
an examination of these two forms of pride and demonstrated differences between 
dominance and prestige on a whole host of psychological traits, emotions, and abili-
ties. Overall, the consistent message of this research is that prestige and dominance </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>86 S. L. Blader and Y.-R. Chen
</p>
<p>represent dramatically different dimensions of social hierarchy&mdash;with prestige pri-
marily associated with prosocial and socially-valued psychological traits and emo-
tions, and dominance primarily associated with antisocial and socially-undesirable 
traits and emotions. Cheng et al. helped to differentiate between social hierarchy 
that is fear and power focused and social hierarchy is that prosocial and respect 
focused (with the latter form of social hierarchy closely matching our conceptual-
ization of status).
</p>
<p>In a more recent set of studies, Cheng et al. (2013) further built on the prestige 
versus dominance dichotomy and found additional evidence that they both repre-
sent distinct, yet viable, means to attaining influence and prominence. They did so 
by tracking the effects of dominance versus prestige strategies in both actual and 
observed groups. This work contributes to efforts to distinguish the dimensions of 
social hierarchy since it shows that prestige and dominance represent dramatically 
different and easily recognizable tactics for attaining high social rank (see also Ha-
levy et al. 2012, who likewise found divergent antecedents of prestige and domi-
nance). Prior research on prestige and dominance validates our argument that it is 
critical to differentiate the dimensions of social hierarchy and, moreover, that one 
cannot simply look to a single dimension of social hierarchy in order to understand 
where a given target stands on other dimensions. In other words, knowing a given 
individual&rsquo;s standing with regard to influence or prominence would not be infor-
mative about their standing on other dimensions, such as prestige and dominance 
(which map on to status and power, respectively).
</p>
<p>Toward an Integrative Model of the Dimensions of Social 
</p>
<p>Hierarchy
</p>
<p>The foregoing review of work distinguishing between status and power demon-
strates the emerging empirical support for&mdash;and confirms longstanding arguments 
in favor of&mdash;differentiating these two dimensions of social hierarchy. In addition, 
the related empirical work that distinguishes prestige from dominance also sup-
ports the overall argument that precision is important when it comes to the various 
dimensions on which actors in a given social context can be rank-ordered against 
one another. Those dimensions greatly differ from one another in terms of their 
antecedents, mechanisms, and consequences. As such, our understanding of social 
life demands an appreciation for the various dimensions along which social actors 
can attain high rank.
</p>
<p>Yet, recognition of the various dimensions of social hierarchy should be the be-
ginning, not the end, of researchers&rsquo; efforts to gain a better understanding of hierar-
chy. It is not enough to simply advance the argument that it is important to distin-
guish among status, power, prestige, dominance, influence, and other dimensions 
on which social actors can be rank-ordered. While distinct, these dimensions are not 
wholly independent of one another, and thus we need an integrative framework for 
seeing how they relate to one another. How do all these related (and, unfortunately, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>874 What&rsquo;s in a Name? Status, Power, and Other Forms of Social Hierarchy
</p>
<p>often confounded) dimensions fit together? Given the nascent stage of efforts to 
distinguish these dimensions, there is relatively little existing work and thus little 
guidance on this issue. In light of the importance of developing such a framework&mdash;
and in recognition of the fact that there is little work on this issue to date&mdash;below 
we put forward a proposal for one such integrative framework. However, we fully 
recognize that our framework is highly tentative and that our primary goal is to 
stimulate thinking on the matter rather than to provide the final word.
</p>
<p>Our proposed framework distinguishes among three different &ldquo;categories&rdquo; of 
the dimensions of social hierarchical rank: (a) antecedents of social rank; (b) di-
mensions of social rank; and (c) consequences of social rank. In other words, it 
advocates unpacking the various dimensions of social hierarchical differentiation 
according to their role or function, emphasizing three particular roles: antecedents, 
social rank itself, and consequences. Antecedents of social rank refer to those di-
mensions of social hierarchy that describe how or why a particular actor achieves 
high social rank in the first place. These antecedents can include characteristics of 
the actors themselves or types of behaviors that they may engage in. Regardless, 
antecedents refer to the foundation of a given social actor&rsquo;s social standing.
</p>
<p>Consequences, on the other hand, capture downstream effects of one&rsquo;s social 
rank, such as one&rsquo;s influence or prominence. This leaves the middle category&mdash;di-
mensions of social standing, which are the hierarchical dimensions that account 
for the impact of antecedents of social rank on the downstream consequences of 
social rank. This middle category highlights the hierarchical dimensions that mat-
ter; the consequences explain why they matter, while the antecedents explain how 
they develop. Thus, we essentially propose thinking about the many bases of social 
hierarchical differentiation in terms of a mediation model, with distinct categories 
of antecedents, mediating processes/constructs, and consequences.
</p>
<p>Antecedents of Social Rank Prior research and theorizing has noted many anteced-
ent factors that result in people attaining high social rank. These factors include: 
(a) demonstrating value to the group (Anderson and Kilduff 2009; Willer 2009) 
(which includes prestige (Henrich and Gil-White 2001), as described in the previ-
ous section); (b) dominance and aggression (Buss and Duntley 2006; Henrich and 
Gil-White 2001); (c) status characteristics (Berger et al. 1972); (d) SES (Krauss 
et al. 2009); (e) emotion (Tiedens 2001); and (f) personality (Cheng et al. 2013). 
Each of these has been examined in prior research as a dimension on which social 
actors&rsquo; standing is predicated. Moreover, several of these have also been described 
as dimensions of social hierarchy themselves. Consider, for instance, SES a dimen-
sion that arrays social actors according to their wealth. Rather than considering this 
hierarchical dimension (i.e., wealth) as equivalent to all others, we instead think 
it is valuable to recognize wealth as an antecedent that, in combination with other 
antecedents, shapes social rank.
</p>
<p>Of course, several of these antecedents can be further deconstructed into more 
specific factors. Consider, for instance, demonstrating value to the group. There are 
multiple ways in which actors can demonstrate their value to the group (Anderson 
and Kilduff 2009)&mdash;i.e., there are multiple factors that determine where a given so-
cial actor ranks on this dimension. People can demonstrate their value to the group </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>88 S. L. Blader and Y.-R. Chen
</p>
<p>by being highly motivated and helping fellow group members complete challenging 
group-relevant tasks. They can also demonstrate their value by having great compe-
tence in skills that are critical for the group&rsquo;s success, as per the prestige approaches 
to attaining high social rank (Henrich and Gil-White 2001). Demonstrating com-
mitment to the group is yet another factor that will shape one&rsquo;s perceived value to 
the group. Moreover, these various factors may not combine in an additive manner. 
For example, competence and helping may well combine interactively in determin-
ing one&rsquo;s overall perceived value to the group. So the antecedents themselves may 
represent quite complex constructs.
</p>
<p>Some antecedents have been described as dimensions of social hierarchy (e.g., 
prestige, dominance, SES), while others have been more explicitly described as 
antecedents of social standing (e.g., emotions, status characteristics, commitment 
to the group). Regardless, the factor common to all of the antecedents listed above 
(and others that have yet to be investigated) is that they shape individuals&rsquo; social 
rank on some valued dimension. They are characteristics of the individual or behav-
ioral displays by the individual that, when perceived by others, impact how those 
observers evaluate and rank the individual on dimensions of social rank.
</p>
<p>It is worth briefly considering this last point and how it relates to the prestige 
construct described above. Cheng et al. (2013) noted that prestige&rsquo;s focus on respect 
makes it closely related to the definition of status that we adopt above, and, in fact, 
Cheng et al. indicate that they regard prestige and status as synonymous. We take a 
slightly different approach to this issue and question whether prestige and status are 
best defined as synonymous constructs. Cheng et al. defined prestige as referring to 
a suite of factors (i.e., associated emotions, cognitions, and behaviors) that a social 
actor may use to cultivate respect and admiration from others (whereas dominance 
refers to a suite of factors that a social actor may use to cultivate fear in others). We 
distinguish such tactics from the subjective evaluations that they actually prompt 
in others. In this way, we distinguish prestige from status. That is, we regard pres-
tige as an antecedent in our proposed model, since prestige (as conceptualized in 
Cheng et al. and in Henrich and Gil-White 2001) refers to a range of approaches and 
strategies that can ultimately lead one to achieve status through status-conferral pro-
cesses. Based on the same reasoning, dominance is likewise an antecedent. A key 
implication of our approach is that both prestige and dominance can, in theory, be 
related to either status or power evaluations. The extent to which these two distinct 
approaches impact status or power will depend on the group&rsquo;s culture, norms, and 
values. That is, context will play a large part in determining the impact of any given 
antecedent on any given dimension of social rank. More generally, any of the ante-
cedents of hierarchical differentiation that we outlined above can shape either of the 
dimensions of social rank (e.g., in some contexts dominance can prompt status, and 
in others prestige can prompt power).
</p>
<p>Dimensions of Social Rank The dimensions of social rank refer to dimensions along 
which social actors are ranked that explain the effect of the antecedent factors just 
described on downstream consequences. In other words, they describe the mecha-
nism by which antecedent factors such as value to the group, dominance, emotions 
such as anger, and personality characteristics such as extraversion have downstream </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>894 What&rsquo;s in a Name? Status, Power, and Other Forms of Social Hierarchy
</p>
<p>consequences for a given individual. This is the category in which we locate status 
and power, which we reviewed extensively above. Status and power both describe 
critical dimensions of social rank, but do not describe the antecedent factors that led 
to them or the downstream consequences of holding them.
</p>
<p>Each of the antecedent factors we described above can impact a given actor&rsquo;s 
status and/or power. In some cases, the effect of a given antecedent may be the same 
for status and power (e.g., conscientiousness may have a positive association with 
both, whereas membership in a stigmatized group may be negatively associated 
with both). Other antecedents may have opposite effects on status and power (e.g., 
anger may enhance power but diminish status; subservient helping may enhance 
status but diminish power). And still other antecedents may impact status or power 
but have no effect on the other dimension of social standing (e.g., commitment to 
the group may impact status while having no effect on power).
</p>
<p>Consequences of Social Rank Distinct from the antecedents and dimensions of 
social rank are its downstream consequences. These refer to the effects that one&rsquo;s 
social rank can have on any of a variety of outcomes. Such outcomes can include 
individuals&rsquo; influence on other group members; their prominence within a group; 
their leadership in the group; and the extent to which other group members defer to 
them, a sub-class of influence.
</p>
<p>Prior research has not consistently conceptualized these as outcomes of social 
rank, but, rather, has often considered them dimensions of social rank on par with 
status, power, and other dimensions we have categorized as antecedents. As an ex-
ample, influence has often been (and continues to be) rolled into definitions and op-
erationalizations of power and status. Like others (Fiske and Berdahl 2007; Magee 
and Galinsky 2008), we regard influence as a downstream outcome of status and 
power, i.e. as a consequence of status and power but not an element inherent in the 
constructs themselves. Differentiating the consequences of social rank is essential 
to efforts to distinguish among the various dimensions of social hierarchy. For ex-
ample, if influence is embedded in conceptualizations of status and power, then any 
evidence of influence cannot be differentiated from its basis. As such, relying on 
influence as an index for people&rsquo;s status makes it impossible to differentiate their 
status from their power.
</p>
<p>Consequences of social rank include many of the outcome variables in the stud-
ies described earlier, in the section on differentiating power and status. For instance, 
justice enacted toward others, perspective taking, demeaning behaviors, and so-
cial judgments are all outcomes that we described earlier as being differentially 
shaped by power and status. Our approach highlights the mechanism by which these 
outcomes are linked to the antecedents of social rank and thus suggests intriguing 
avenues for future research. Consider, perhaps, that there is a negative relation-
ship between dominance and justice, or between anger and perspective taking. Our 
approach suggests that these effects may be (at least partially) mediated by power. 
Or, perhaps, perceived warmth is positively related to helping, or extraversion is 
positively related to justice enacted toward others. These relationships may be (at 
least partially) mediated by status. There are extraordinary possibilities that emerge 
from drawing the distinctions made in our proposed framework, possibilities that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>90 S. L. Blader and Y.-R. Chen
</p>
<p>present the opportunity to enrich our understanding of the role that social hierarchy 
plays in explaining a wide variety of phenomena.
</p>
<p>What is the Value of such a Framework? The underlying premise of our proposed 
framework is quite straightforward&mdash;we simply argue for differentiating anteced-
ents and consequences of social rank from the critical dimensions of social rank. 
We have noted that this simple premise opens up a wide range of possibilities for 
studying the mediating effects of status and power on group phenomena. Moreover, 
the premise of our framework directs greater attention to the strategies by which 
social actors can gain status or power (by bringing greater attention to the anteced-
ent factors), as well as to the consequences of doing so. Categorizing the various 
dimensions of social hierarchy in terms of this causal model can go a long way in 
advancing the study of social hierarchy, as compared with maintaining a model in 
which everything is grouped into a single bucket of social hierarchical constructs 
with little to differentiate them. Moreover, efforts to distinguish between status and 
power are advanced by focusing on their respective antecedents and consequences. 
Doing so makes clear that different patterns of relationships exist between (a) the 
antecedents to social rank and status versus power and (b) status versus power and 
the consequences of social rank.
</p>
<p>Our framework also highlights a critical difference between research on status 
and research on power. Power research, to date, has focused primarily on studying 
its consequences for the power-holder. For example, prior research has emphasized 
that power enhances approach tendencies (Keltner et al. 2003); increases social 
distance (Magee and Smith 2013); elevates positive affect (Anderson and Berdahl 
2002); and leads to biased perception, selective framing, or inattention to details 
(Guinote 2007). In contrast, status research has focused mainly on studying its an-
tecedents, such as competence, commitment, generosity, and demographics (i.e., 
the variables discussed in our framework as antecedents). Relatively less power re-
search has examined its antecedents. Moreover, to the extent that status research has 
examined consequences, they have been consequences that emerge among those 
interacting with status-holders rather than psychological consequences for the sta-
tus-holders themselves. For instance, prior work has explored consequences of high 
status such as receiving support (Van der Vegt et al. 2006) or receiving extra credit 
for performance and successes (Fan and Gruenfeld 1998; Poldony 2005), both of 
which are bestowed on high-status individuals by their lower-status counterparts. 
Due to this different focus in the power and status literatures, we know relatively 
less about the factors that lead to resource control and thus power; and we know rel-
atively less about the intra-psychic consequences that follow for an individual who 
holds a position of respect and prestige. Yet, these are critical issues for developing 
a comprehensive understanding of social hierarchy. Our framework highlights these 
gaps both in prior research and in our understanding of the full range of dynamics 
related to status and power.
</p>
<p>Finally, we wish to highlight that these dynamics become more complicated 
when the interrelationship between power and status is considered. Indeed, respect 
(i.e., status) can lead to resource control, and resource control (i.e., power) can 
lead to status. In other words, status and power are themselves antecedents of so-</p>
<p/>

<p>914 What&rsquo;s in a Name? Status, Power, and Other Forms of Social Hierarchy
</p>
<p>cial rank. Do the consequences that follow from power shift when one&rsquo;s power is 
gained through status as opposed to through dominance? Do the consequences that 
follow from status shift when one&rsquo;s status is gained through resource control rather 
than through demonstrated value to the group? Moreover, by what mechanism do 
status and power lead to one another? For example, does the effect of status on 
deference enable status-holders to enact plans that result in resource acquisition for 
themselves? This is just one of a myriad of reciprocal relationships that may exist 
between status and power. While analyzing these relationships is beyond the scope 
of our effort to simply distinguish these constructs, it is certainly important for 
future research to keep these complex relations in mind. Our proposed framework 
offers a language and a structure for doing that.
</p>
<p>Conclusion
</p>
<p>Our goal in this chapter has been to bring greater attention to the various dimensions 
of social hierarchy and, in particular, to raise awareness about the importance of 
differentiating among these dimensions. As we noted in the beginning of the chap-
ter, lessons from other research areas provide testament to the importance of such 
differentiation. Yet, to date, remarkably little work has focused on empirically dif-
ferentiating the various dimensions of social hierarchy. The development of research 
on social hierarchy stands to benefit from the conceptual clarity that can come from 
differentiating these dimensions. Moreover, the framework we propose for catego-
rizing the dimensions of social hierarchy highlights an incredibly fruitful range of 
research questions and projects. But on a more general level, our very understanding 
of social life stands to be enhanced by a deeper appreciation of the variety and types 
of dimensions of social hierarchy. Indeed, social hierarchy is a truly fundamental 
element of all contexts in which multiple social actors gather. Thus, understanding 
those contexts demands a deeper understanding not only of the psychology of social 
status but also of the psychology of all dimensions of social hierarchy.

</p>
<p>Status hierarchies, a ubiquitous and fundamental feature of social life, have profound 
implications for individual welfare. Individuals with higher status are accorded more 
respect and influence, enjoy more influence and control in their social environment, 
more freedom and autonomy in determining their own behavior, higher subjective 
well-being, better health, and longer lifespans (for a review, see Anderson et al. 
2013). Individuals with lower status, in contrast, are given less respect and social at-
tention, have less control, face more constraints on their behavior, experience lower 
self-esteem and happiness, and suffer more from mental and physical illness.
</p>
<p>Given the importance of status, it is critical to understand how status differences 
develop. That is, why are some people accorded higher status whereas others are 
relegated to the bottom of the social order? Are there certain personal characteris-
tics that make some people more likely to rise in status and others fall? Research 
on these questions has traditionally focused on demographic characteristics such as 
gender, ethnicity, and age (e.g., Berger et al. 1972). More recently, however, schol-
ars have begun to examine the role of personality. This recent work has shown that 
status-organizing processes are multifaceted and complex, and that diverse kinds 
of individual differences play an important role in determining status hierarchies in 
groups and face-to-face interactions.
</p>
<p>The current chapter has two primary aims. First, we review studies of the ef-
fects of personality on status attainment. We specifically focus our attention on the 
personality dimensions that have been most consistently examined in studies of 
status&mdash;namely, the Big Five personality dimensions, trait dominance, self-mon-
itoring, and narcissism. Second, we seek to help explain the findings that emerge 
from the literature, or why some personality traits facilitate status attainment 
whereas others do not. To do so we use a recently proposed Micropolitics theory of 
status-organizing processes (Anderson and Kennedy 2012). As we describe in the 
following section, the Micropolitics theory argues that an individual&rsquo;s status is a </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>100 C. Anderson and J. Cowan
</p>
<p>product of both a group&rsquo;s judgments of which individuals deserve higher status, and 
of the individual&rsquo;s motivation and ability to seek higher status.
</p>
<p>At the core of status is the respect and admiration individuals achieve in the eyes 
of others (Anderson et al. 2001; Magee and Galinsky 2008). Individuals with higher 
status tend to be more socially prominent and receive more attention from others 
(Chance 1967), and to be given more influence and control (Willer 2009).
</p>
<p>Micropolitics Theory of Status
</p>
<p>The Role of the Group in Determining Status
</p>
<p>In line with functionalist views of status, the Micropolitics theory proposes that 
status is ultimately a function of the group&rsquo;s collective judgments and decisions 
about which individuals deserve social status (Bales et al. 1951; Berger et al. 1972; 
Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989; Emerson 1962; Goldhamer and Shils 1939). That is, groups 
develop an implicit consensus as to which individual characteristics are valuable to 
the collective, and allocate high- and low-status positions according to whether the 
individual possesses relatively more of those characteristics. Individuals who pos-
sess characteristics that allow them to make important contributions to the group are 
afforded high-status positions, whereas individuals who possess fewer characteris-
tics that would provide social value are allocated low-status positions.
</p>
<p>The characteristics viewed as socially valuable can vary from group to group 
(Anderson et al. 2008b); but in general, two kinds of attributes are important. First, 
individuals must appear to possess competencies central to the group&rsquo;s primary 
goals and challenges (Driskell and Mullen 1990; Ridgeway 1987). For example, 
superior athletic abilities will help an individual attain higher status on a soccer 
team because such abilities help the team win games; superior leadership skills will 
help an individual attain higher status on a work project team because such skills 
will help him or her manage the team&rsquo;s process and coordinate members&rsquo; activities.
</p>
<p>Second, individuals must also appear to be collectively minded, or willing to use 
their competences to benefit others and contribute to the group&rsquo;s success as a whole 
(Ridgeway 1982; Willer 2009). As Blau (1964) explained, &ldquo;To earn the deference as 
well as the respect of others, it is not enough for an individual to impress them with 
his outstanding qualities; he must use these abilities for their benefit&rdquo; (p. 162). In-
deed, accumulating evidence suggests individuals who appear collectively minded 
are given higher status than those who seem solely self-interested (Griskevicius 
et al. 2010; Hardy and Van Vugt 2006; Ridgeway 1982; Willer 2009).
</p>
<p>It is important to note that status is given to individuals who are perceived to 
provide value to the group&mdash;not necessarily those who actually provide social val-
ue. For example, much research has shown that groups can mistakenly perceive 
members with certain demographic characteristics as more competent and, as a re-
sult, accord those individuals higher status, even when those members are actually </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1015 Personality and Status Attainment: A Micropolitics Perspective
</p>
<p>no more competent than others (for a review, see Berger et al. 1980). In short, per-
ceptions of social value, not actual value, drive status conferral.
</p>
<p>The Role of Individual Pursuit of Status
</p>
<p>While groups might ultimately decide who is afforded high or low status, the 
Micropolitics theory also argues that individuals proactively pursue higher status. 
Individuals are not mere passive recipients of status, but instead behave in ways to 
increase or maintain their current level of status. Specifically, because status is af-
forded to individuals who are perceived to provide value, individuals jockey for sta-
tus by striving to enhance their value to the group in the eyes of others&mdash;for instance 
by highlighting their competencies or their collective-mindedness to others, or by 
establishing important relationships and alliances. For example, individuals work 
to improve their abilities in socially valuable domains (Sutton and Hargadon 1996), 
engage in self-presentational strategies to portray their abilities in the best possible 
light (see Leary et al. in this volume, Chap. 8), or make more public contributions 
to the collective to convey their generosity and commitment to the group&rsquo;s success 
(e.g., Hardy and Van Vugt 2006).
</p>
<p>In this way, status-organizing processes in social groups can be seen as a &ldquo;micro&rdquo; 
analogue of electoral politics. Just as in political elections, group members are cho-
sen by the collective to occupy high status, influential positions. Individual mem-
bers, just like political candidates, are selected according to whether they exhibit 
the right characteristics&mdash;competencies such as decision-making skills, leadership 
abilities, etc.&mdash;as well as whether they exhibit a commitment to others&rsquo; welfare. 
Further, individual group members, just like political candidates, &ldquo;win&rdquo; high-status 
positions if they are more skilled at enhancing their general reputation of providing 
social value (regardless of whether they actually provide social value).
</p>
<p>In many ways, the Micropolitics theory of status builds from research on self-
presentation (see Leary et al., in this volume, Chap. 8). Similar to self-presentation-
al accounts, the Micropolitics theory argues that people pursue higher status in part 
by managing their impression and social image. However, the Micropolitics theory 
also goes a bit further in incorporating behaviors unrelated to self-presentation, such 
as the development of friendships and alliances throughout a social network and the 
derogation of status competitors that diminishes their value in the eyes of others.
</p>
<p>The Micropolitics theory also avoids the controversy surrounding dominance 
theories of rank. That is, some theorists have proposed that individuals can attain 
higher rank in groups through a &ldquo;dominance&rdquo; path, which involves coercing oth-
ers to defer based on intimidation and fear (e.g., Cheng and Tracy, this volume, 
Chap. 1; Lee and Ofshe 1981; Mazur 1985). Although this account has received em-
pirical support (Cheng et al. 2013, 2010), several researchers have raised questions 
regarding whether dominance promotes influence solely by virtue of fear induction 
(see commentaries following Lee and Ofshe 1981; also Anderson and Kilduff 2009; 
Ridgeway 1987; Ridgeway and Diekema 1989). The Micropolitics theory does not </p>
<p/>

<p>102 C. Anderson and J. Cowan
</p>
<p>propose that individuals pursue higher status through coercion and inducing fear in 
others alone; rather, it proposes that individuals pursue higher status by conveying 
to others that they provide social value.
</p>
<p>The Role of Personality in Status Attainment
</p>
<p>Through this Micropolitics lens, personality traits can contribute to status attain-
ment for a number of reasons. First, personality traits might involve skills or abili-
ties that are important to the group&rsquo;s success. Individuals with particular traits might 
tend to possess superior social and leadership skills, for example, and thus be more 
likely to attain higher status. Second, personality traits might correlate with a stron-
ger desire to pursue status. Prior research has shown that individuals who are more 
motivated to attain higher status are in fact more likely to attain it, suggesting they 
engage in a variety of &ldquo;micropolitical&rdquo; behaviors that help them ascend the social 
order (Anderson and Kilduff 2009). Third, personality traits might correlate with 
the ability to signal one&rsquo;s value to the group more effectively. For example, some 
traits might allow people to engage in the right self-presentational strategies or to 
draw more attention to their important competences. It is important to note that 
these behaviors are not necessarily consciously enacted (e.g., Schlenker 2012). For 
example, individuals might draw attention to their expertise in a given area without 
any conscious intent to attain higher status among peers.
</p>
<p>Research Review
</p>
<p>The current review focuses on the personality traits that have been most consis-
tently studied as predictors of status. This includes the Big Five personality dimen-
sions&mdash;extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness 
to experience. It also includes trait dominance, which is viewed as part of the broad-
er extraversion factor in the Big Five framework; but that has been examined sepa-
rately from extraversion in a multitude of studies and therefore warrants its own 
discussion. Finally, the review includes studies of self-monitoring and narcissism, 
two personality traits that have been increasingly linked to status in recent years.
</p>
<p>The review includes studies of ad hoc groups&mdash;that is, individuals experimental-
ly assigned to groups that exist only for short periods of time and that work together 
on a specific task&mdash;as well as studies of more typical groups, or groups that exist 
for extended periods of time, in which members spend a good deal of time togeth-
er, and have a wide range of interactions. It includes studies of status differences 
per se as well as studies of emergent leadership structures and of emergent differ-
ences in influence within groups. Status can be conceptually distinguished from 
constructs such as leadership and influence (Magee and Galinsky 2008), within the 
context of task groups the three constructs correlate so strongly as to be virtually </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>1035 Personality and Status Attainment: A Micropolitics Perspective
</p>
<p>indistinguishable (e.g., Bales et al. 1951). Therefore, we felt it appropriate to in-
clude studies of emergent leadership and of differences in influence.
</p>
<p>Extraversion
</p>
<p>Summary of Findings Extraversion implies an &ldquo;energetic approach to the social 
and material world and includes traits such as sociability, activity, assertiveness, 
and positive emotionality&rdquo; (John and Srivastava 1999, p. 121). An abundance of 
research has shown a strong and consistent relation between extraversion and status. 
Multiple reviews of the emergent leadership literature have shown that extraverts 
tend to emerge as leaders in groups more than introverts (Bass 2008; Judge et al. 
2002; Mann 1959; Stogdill 1948). Recent research has continued to observe similar 
effects: Deuling et al. (2011) found that extraversion predicted peer-rated influence 
in project teams of psychology freshman. Colbert et al. (2012) found that self- and 
peer-rated extraversion predicted emergent leadership in teams comprised of under-
graduate and Master of Business Administration (MBA) students. Bendersky and 
Shah (2013) similarly found that extraversion predicted status in the early stages of 
student project teams.
</p>
<p>Moreover, the status benefits of extraversion extend beyond teams to larger 
groups. Anderson et al. (2001) found extraversion predicted peer-rated status in 
college fraternities, sororities, and dormitories. Indeed in the dormitories, extraver-
sion measured at the beginning of the academic year predicted status attainment 9 
months later. Similarly, Harms et al. (2007) also found that extraverts were rated by 
their peers in fraternities and sororities as having more influence. Anderson et al. 
(2008) found that extraversion predicted peer-rated influence in a consulting firm. 
Finally, Ames et al. (2012) found that MBA students higher in extraversion were 
rated by former coworkers as having more influence in their prior job.
</p>
<p>Even longitudinal studies that assess the attainment of status over long periods of 
time have found similar results. George et al. (2011) found in sample of women who 
graduated from Mills College that extraversion measured at age 21 predicted status 
of job they attained at age 52. Judge and Kammeyer-Mueller (2012) also found that 
self- and peer-rated extraversion predicted participants&rsquo; occupational prestige in a 
longitudinal study that spanned several decades.
</p>
<p>Why Do Extraverts Attain Status? Building from the Micropolitics theory of 
status, there are several possible reasons why extraverts attain higher status so con-
sistently. First, extraversion is associated with the actual possession of social and 
leadership skills that are useful in almost all group settings (Akert and Panter 1988; 
Riggio 1986). For example, extraverts are more verbally expressive (Ames et al. 
2012) and tend to use a &ldquo;transformational&rdquo; leadership style (Judge and Bono 2000), 
which is highly effective in leading groups (Bass 2008).
</p>
<p>Second, extraverts are often perceived by others as being highly task competent. 
For example, Paulhus and Morgan (1997) found individuals who were less shy (i.e., 
more extraverted) were perceived as more intelligent. In the aforementioned study </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>104 C. Anderson and J. Cowan
</p>
<p>by Anderson et al. (2008), extraverts attained higher status in a consulting firm but 
not in an engineering department of a telecommunications firm, presumably be-
cause extraverts were viewed as more competent in the team-focused culture of the 
consulting firm, but not in the engineering department where individuals worked 
alone on technical problems.
</p>
<p>Third, some evidence suggests extraverts desire status more strongly than intro-
verts (Brunell et al. 2008; Judge and Kammeyer-Mueller 2012; Olson and Weber 
2004). Consistent with this notion, extraverts tend to engage in more &ldquo;micropo-
litical&rdquo; behaviors. For example, they signal their value to the group by drawing 
attention to themselves and to their positive attributes, such as their skills and abili-
ties (Kyl-Heku and Buss 1996), and their valued resources (Buss 1996). They also 
develop a wider set of relationships, which is particularly important in larger social 
groups where it is easy for individuals to get &ldquo;lost in the crowd&rdquo; (Anderson and 
Shirako 2008).
</p>
<p>Of course, extraverts do not always attain higher status. For example, extraver-
sion can of course be independent from competences important to the group; when 
this is the case, extraversion does not predict status (Anderson et al. 2008). Some 
work suggests extraverts who appear competent at first can be &ldquo;found out&rdquo; by peers 
over time as having unimpressive task abilities. For example, in the study by Paul-
hus and Morgan (1997), the link between extraversion and peer-perceived intel-
ligence diminished over time as group members became more familiar with each 
other. Similarly, in Bendersky and Shah (2013), extraverts&rsquo; status decreased in work 
teams over time because the team viewed their contributions as being less than what 
was expected of them initially.
</p>
<p>Trait Dominance
</p>
<p>Summary of Findings The personality trait dominance involves the tendency to 
behave in assertive, forceful, and self-assured ways (Buss and Craik 1980; Gough 
1987; Wiggins 1979). It is important to note that trait dominance is distinct from 
the &ldquo;dominance&rdquo; construct articulated by Cheng, Tracy, and Henrich (e.g., Cheng 
et al. 2010; Cheng and Tracy, this volume, Chap. 1), which they define as entailing 
the induction of fear through intimidation and coercion to attain higher influence 
and rank in a social hierarchy. First, trait dominance is a personality trait, whereas 
Cheng and Tracy&rsquo;s dominance construct is an evolutionary strategy for attaining or 
maintaining influence. Second, trait dominance does not necessarily include induc-
ing fear or intimidating others (Gough 1987), but instead centers on assertive and 
self-assured behavior.
</p>
<p>Similar to extraversion, vast evidence links trait dominance to the attainment of 
status in groups. Large-scale reviews have shown that dominant individuals emerge 
as leaders more than timid or meek individuals (Bass 2008; Judge et al. 2002; Mann 
1959; Stogdill 1948). One meta-analysis of 85 years of research found trait domi-
nance to predict who emerges as the leader in groups more consistently than any </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1055 Personality and Status Attainment: A Micropolitics Perspective
</p>
<p>other individual difference dimension examined, including intelligence (Lord et al. 
1986).
</p>
<p>More recent evidence also provides similar results. Foti and Hauenstein (2007) 
found that in freshman corps of cadets in the military, trait dominance predicted 
emergent leadership in group tasks. Anderson and Kilduff (2009) found trait domi-
nance to strongly predict emergent influence in task-focused groups. And these ef-
fects also extend beyond teams as well: Harms et al. (2007) found trait dominance 
to predict peer-rated influence and the attainment of leader positions in fraternities 
and sororities. Ames and Flynn (2007) found that peer-rated assertiveness predicted 
peer-rated leadership abilities. Interestingly, however, they also found a curvilinear 
relation: while being too low in assertiveness led to lower leadership ratings, so 
did being too high in assertiveness. Presumably, individuals too high in dominance 
provide less social value because they impose their own will on others too much.
</p>
<p>Why Do Individuals Higher in Trait Dominance Attain Status? The personality 
trait dominance involves, almost by definition, a preference for higher-status posi-
tions (Gough 1987). Therefore, one reason why individuals higher in dominance 
tend to attain high status is that they are more likely to pursue it than others.
</p>
<p>Yet trait dominance is also related to being perceived by others as more compe-
tent socially and technically, and therefore as contributing more value to the group. 
For example, Anderson and Kilduff (2009) found that individuals higher in trait 
dominance were viewed by other group members as more verbally skilled and more 
competent at the group task. Strikingly, this occurred even though dominant indi-
viduals were actually no more competent than others. For example, among teams 
working on math problems, dominant individuals did not have higher scores on 
standardized math tests, nor did they provide more accurate answers during the 
group task. Yet they were still perceived as more quantitatively skilled by team-
mates.
</p>
<p>To examine how individuals higher in trait dominance conveyed superior com-
petence even when they lacked it, Anderson and Kilduff (2009) examined videotape 
of the group sessions and analyzed each person&rsquo;s behavior. They discovered two 
things. First, individuals higher in trait dominance were more engaged in the group 
tasks, spoke more, and displayed more of a commitment to the group&rsquo;s success. 
Second, they exhibited more outward signals of competence, such as volunteering 
answers and providing problem-relevant information. Therefore, although domi-
nant individuals were not actually any more competent than others in their group, 
they came across as more competent because they took initiative and conveyed 
confidence in their abilities.
</p>
<p>Trait dominance not only leads individuals to be mistakenly perceived as more 
competent, it also allows the competences and talents that individuals do actually 
possess to be noticed by others. Because individuals&rsquo; abilities are typically hidden 
from others, sometimes highly competent and talented individuals fail to be seen as 
such by others (e.g., Berger et al. 1972; Driskell and Mullen 1990; Lord 1985). Trait 
dominance increases the chances that an individual&rsquo;s abilities will shine through. 
For example, a meta-analysis by Judge et al. (2004) found that for more &ldquo;directive&rdquo; </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>106 C. Anderson and J. Cowan
</p>
<p>individuals (who are more dominant), intelligence predicted emergent leadership, 
yet for less directive individuals, their intelligence had no impact on the leadership 
role they attained. These findings suggest that for more dominant individuals, their 
skills and abilities are more likely to become known by others. For individuals who 
are more timid and meek in contrast, their competence might remain hidden and 
undetected by the group.
</p>
<p>Agreeableness
</p>
<p>Summary of Findings The relationship between agreeableness and status pres-
ents a puzzle. Agreeableness involves altruism, trust, modesty, and a tender-minded 
concern for others (Graziano and Eisenberg 1997; Hampson et al. 1987). Therefore, 
theoretically one would expect agreeable individuals to attain higher status because 
they tend to be more collectively minded; they care more about others&rsquo; welfare and 
are more selfless and generous with others (Graziano and Eisenberg 1997; Hamp-
son et al. 1987), traits that should lead to status attainment (e.g., Blau 1964). How-
ever, the empirical evidence suggests agreeableness is typically unrelated or even 
negatively related to status attainment.
</p>
<p>For example, agreeableness and traits related to agreeableness do not emerge as 
predictors of emergent leadership (for reviews, see Bass 2008; Judge et al. 2002; 
Mann 1959; Stogdill 1948). In fact, Judge et al. (2002) found that agreeableness 
was the only Big Five dimension that did not predict emergent leadership. Similarly, 
in the aforementioned study by Anderson et al. (2001), agreeableness did not pre-
dict status in college social-living groups of any kind or at any time in the group&rsquo;s 
development. In the study by Colbert et al. (2012) agreeableness did not predict 
emergent leadership in MBA and undergraduate student task groups when taking 
into account other personality traits. Brunell et al. (2008) found that agreeableness 
did not predict emergent leadership in task groups after controlling for other person-
ality dimensions. Anderson et al. (2008) study found no link between agreeableness 
and peer-rated influence in a consulting firm or an engineering department. One 
study did find a positive effect: Ames et al. (2012) found that individuals viewed 
by their former coworkers&rsquo; as being agreeable were also viewed by them as being 
influential. However, it is difficult to know whether this effect was due to shared 
method variance.
</p>
<p>Some studies have even found a negative relation between agreeableness and 
status attainment. Neubert and Taggar (2004) examined intact manufacturing teams 
that had worked together for an extended period of time and found agreeable in-
dividuals were less likely to be nominated by coworkers as a leader. Cheng et al. 
(2010) found that agreeableness negatively predicted peer-rated &ldquo;dominance&rdquo; in 
college athletic teams. Bendersky and Shah (2013) found that agreeableness nega-
tively predicted status in the early stages of student project teams.
</p>
<p>Why Would Agreeable Individuals Fail to Attain Higher Status? We propose 
agreeable individuals refrain from engaging in the &ldquo;micropolitical&rdquo; behaviors that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1075 Personality and Status Attainment: A Micropolitics Perspective
</p>
<p>would signal their social value to the group. Therefore, while agreeable individuals 
might actually possess socially valued characteristics and engage in more coopera-
tive behavior, they do not develop a reputation as such because they do not behave 
in ways that draws attention to those characteristics or behaviors. Indeed, Anderson 
and Shirako (2008) found that many individuals who consistently behaved coopera-
tively and selflessly in their interactions with others still did not gain a reputation 
for being cooperative; their behavioral pattern needed to be visible to others for 
others to develop positive perceptions of the individual.
</p>
<p>In support of this argument, some evidence suggests agreeable individuals desire 
higher status less than others (Olson and Weber 2004). Moreover, while extraverts 
and dominant individuals are willing to engage in a wide range of behaviors to at-
tain higher status, agreeable individuals are not (Kyl-Heku and Buss 1996). For ex-
ample, while extraverts are willing to boast about their accomplishments, work hard 
to impress others, display their knowledge to others, and engage in social situations 
to attain higher status, agreeable individuals are unwilling to do so; in fact, the av-
erage correlation between extraversion and status-pursuing behaviors was r = 0.36, 
whereas the average correlation between agreeableness and those same behaviors 
was r = 0.00 (Kyl-Heku and Buss 1996). In short, therefore, the evidence suggests 
that status attainment requires engaging in micropolitical behaviors, and that agree-
able individuals are unwilling to do so.
</p>
<p>Why would agreeableness predict the attainment of lower status? Otherwise 
stated, why would disagreeable individuals sometimes attain high status if they are 
colder, more aloof, and less concerned about others&rsquo; welfare? One possibility is that 
disagreeable individuals are more willing to engage in some of the more deceptive 
and manipulative tactics to get ahead, such as derogating others, boasting, and ag-
gression (Kyl-Heku and Buss 1996). Similarly, disagreeable individuals are more 
willing to engage in conflict with others (Graziano et al. 1996), a willingness that 
can be important to status in some contexts (Cohen et al. 1996). It is also possible 
that agreeable people are simply more willing to conform and submit more to oth-
ers&rsquo; concerns and wishes.
</p>
<p>Conscientiousness
</p>
<p>Summary of Findings Conscientiousness refers to &ldquo;socially prescribed impulse 
control that facilitates task- and goal-directed behavior&rdquo; (John and Srivastava 1999, 
p. 121); thus, conscientious individuals are dutiful, hardworking, and organized. 
The research literature that has examined conscientiousness and status has found 
that conscientious individuals attain higher status in task-focused contexts such as 
project teams or workplaces, but not necessarily in other contexts.
</p>
<p>In the aforementioned review by Judge et al. (2002), conscientiousness predicts 
emergent leadership in task groups. Neubert and Taggar (2004) found that con-
scientiousness predicted peer-nominated leadership in intact manufacturing teams 
(though the finding was marginally significant). Anderson et al. (2008) found con-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>108 C. Anderson and J. Cowan
</p>
<p>scientiousness to predict peer-rated influence in an engineering department of a 
telecommunications firm. Cheng et al. (2010) found that conscientious members of 
college athletic teams were rated by teammates as higher on the &ldquo;prestige&rdquo; compo-
nent of status. Ames et al. (2012) found coworker-rated conscientiousness predicted 
peer-rated influence in the workplace. And Judge and Kammeyer-Mueller (2012) 
found that conscientiousness predicted occupational prestige in a longitudinal study 
of careers.
</p>
<p>However, in social-living groups such as fraternities, sororities, and dormito-
ries, conscientiousness did not predict status attainment (Anderson et al. 2001). 
Moreover, while conscientiousness predicted peer-rated influence in an engineer-
ing department it did not predict peer-rated influence in a consulting firm, where 
teamwork was viewed as contributing to performance relatively more than technical 
skills (Anderson et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>Why Do Conscientious Individuals Attain Status in Some Contexts but Not 
</p>
<p>Others? As mentioned above, the Micropolitics theory argues that groups develop 
an implicit consensus as to which individual characteristics are valuable to the col-
lective, and allocate high- and low-status positions according to whether the indi-
vidual possesses relatively more of those characteristics. In many project teams 
and workplaces, conscientiousness is valuable to the group because conscientious 
individuals work hard and focus their energies on task accomplishment. Therefore, 
in those contexts conscientious individuals are given higher status.
</p>
<p>However, in other contexts that value task performance less, conscientiousness 
will have little to no impact on status attainment. For example, in many college fra-
ternities, hard work, diligence, and good grades are likely irrelevant to the group&rsquo;s 
function and success and therefore irrelevant to status attainment as well. Therefore, 
conscientiousness would seem less central and valued in these groups, suggesting 
that it will not predict status attainment. (It is interesting to note that Harms et al. 
[2007] found conscientiousness to predict peer-rated influence in fraternities and 
sororities; perhaps these organizations put more emphasis on good grades). Simi-
larly, in the consulting firm studied by Anderson et al. (2008), conscientious indi-
viduals&rsquo; task focus was viewed as less important than the ability to work together 
with colleagues in a team-oriented culture. As conscientious individuals were seen 
as providing less important characteristics, they were not afforded higher status.
</p>
<p>Neuroticism
</p>
<p>Summary of Findings The neuroticism dimension of the Big Five reflects individ-
ual differences in negative emotionality, including vulnerability to stress, anxiety, 
depression, and negative self-conscious emotions, such as guilt, shame, and embar-
rassment (Costa and McCrae 1992). Research has consistently shown neuroticism 
relates to lower status.
</p>
<p>As with many other personality traits mentioned above, neuroticism consistently 
emerges as a predictor of emergent leadership in large-scale reviews&mdash;except in this </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1095 Personality and Status Attainment: A Micropolitics Perspective
</p>
<p>case, it predicts a lower likelihood of emerging as a leader (Judge et al. 2002; Stog-
dill 1948). Similarly, Deuling et al. (2011) found that in project teams of psychology 
freshman, neuroticism predicted lower peer-rated influence a full 8 months after the 
teams had been working together. Judge and Kammeyer-Mueller (2012) found that 
self- and peer-rated neuroticism predicted lower occupational prestige in a longitu-
dinal study. Further, Bendersky and Shah (2013) found neuroticism to predict lower 
status in the beginning stages of student project teams.
</p>
<p>There have been a number of nuances found in the link between neuroticism and 
status, however. Anderson et al. (2008) did not find any relation between neuroti-
cism and peer-rated influence in two organizations, for example, suggesting it might 
not always predict lower status. It is possible these null effects were due to strong 
display rules in both organizations that prevented the expression of negative emo-
tion. In that case, coworkers would have a more difficult time detecting neuroticism 
in others. Two studies have also found that neuroticism is far more damaging to 
men&rsquo;s than women&rsquo;s status: Anderson et al. (2001) found this in college social-liv-
ing groups, and Neubert and Taggar (2004) found this in the leadership nominations 
within intact manufacturing teams. In Bendersky and Shah&rsquo;s (2013) study, while 
individuals higher in neuroticism began low in status, they rose in status over time. 
However, the bulk of studies have typically found a simple main (negative) effect 
of neuroticism on status.
</p>
<p>Why Do Individuals High in Neuroticism Attain Lower Status? On the surface, 
it is not entirely clear why neuroticism is such a consistent predictor of lower status 
in groups. Negative emotionality would not seem to harm group performance or 
success in any direct way, as long as the person was still competent on important 
tasks and was willing to contribute his or her abilities for the collective. We believe 
neuroticism leads to lower status because it leads to the perception of lower social 
value, however. Specifically, individuals high in neuroticism are viewed by others 
as being less able to make important contributions to the collective, regardless of 
whether they actually are less capable of doing so.
</p>
<p>For example, in Bendersky and Shah&rsquo;s (2013) study, the student project teams 
expected individuals high in neuroticism originally to contribute less to the team. 
Over time however, these expectations rose as the group members got to know 
each other better, presumably because they relied less on negative emotionality as 
an indicator of individual contribution. Accordingly, those high in neuroticism rose 
in status over time as well. Similarly, men high in neuroticism are likely viewed 
as providing less social value because negative emotionality is viewed more nega-
tively in men than in women (Brody 2000), which is likely why men consistently 
score lower on neuroticism measures (Benet-Martinez and John 1998), and men ex-
press these emotions much less than women even in controlled laboratory settings 
(e.g., Kring and Gordon 1998). Therefore, men in particular might be perceived as 
providing less social value when they exhibit negative emotionality.
</p>
<p>In sum, these findings suggest that neuroticism, perhaps particularly in men, 
might signal to others one&rsquo;s inability to provide social value. Regardless of whether 
the experience of emotions like stress, anxiety, and depression indicate any actual </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>inability to contribute to the group, people might believe that it does, and accord-
ingly give individuals high in neuroticism lower status.
</p>
<p>Openness to Experience
</p>
<p>Summary of Findings Openness describes &ldquo;the breadth, depth, originality, and 
complexity of an individual&rsquo;s mental and experiential life&rdquo; (John and Srivastava 
1999, p. 121). This final dimension of the Big Five taxonomy has been linked to 
status attainment, though the evidence is weaker and less abundant than for other 
personality traits.
</p>
<p>In a review by Judge et al. (2002), openness predicted emergent leadership al-
though it was the second-weakest predictor, behind only agreeableness, which had 
a null effect on leadership. Colbert et al. (2012) presented evidence for relatively 
strong relationships between openness and emergent leadership in student laborato-
ry task groups. Bendersky and Shah (2013) also found openness to predict status in 
student teams at the beginning and 10 weeks into the group&rsquo;s development. George 
et al. (2011) found that openness measured at age 21 predicted the status of the job 
women attained at age 52.
</p>
<p>However, classic reviews of leadership research did not find openness to be a con-
sistent predictor of leader emergence (e.g., Mann 1959; Stogdill 1948). Anderson et al. 
(2001) did not find a single significant relationship between openness and status attain-
ment in college social-living groups. Similarly, a study of organizations by Anderson 
et al. (2008) did not find any effect of openness on peer-rated influence either.
</p>
<p>Why Is Openness to Experience a Weaker and Less Consistent Predictor of 
</p>
<p>Status? Though it is difficult to discern from the existing studies exactly why open-
ness to experience matters somewhat less to status attainment than other dimen-
sions, and matters more in some groups than others, we believe the answer again 
lies in the social value open individuals are perceived by others to provide. Openness 
correlates with creativity and divergent thinking (McCrae 1987) as well as pursu-
ing intellectual and artistic endeavors (Kyl-Heku and Buss 1996). These talents and 
tendencies are likely valued in some group contexts more than others, in particular 
those where the group needs to generate innovative solutions to problems. However, 
even in groups that value divergent thinking and openness to new ideas, it is possible 
that many groups fail to detect which of their members are actually higher in open-
ness to experience. Clearly, more research is needed to address these possibilities.
</p>
<p>Self-Monitoring
</p>
<p>Summary of Findings Snyder (1974) characterizes an individual high in self-
monitoring as someone &ldquo;who, out of a concern for social appropriateness, is partic-
ularly sensitive to the expression and self-presentation of others in social situations 
and uses these cues as guidelines for monitoring his own self-presentation&rdquo; (p. 528). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1115 Personality and Status Attainment: A Micropolitics Perspective
</p>
<p>Otherwise stated, self-monitors care a great deal about the social appropriateness 
of their behavior, are sensitive to social cues, and have the ability to control their 
behavior in response to what is seen as appropriate (Briggs et al. 1980).
</p>
<p>Although the relation between self-monitoring and status has been examined 
relatively less frequently than the traits discussed above, studies suggest self-moni-
toring does play an important role in status attainment. First, self-monitors are more 
likely to emerge as leaders in task groups: Garland and Beard (1979) found self-
monitors emerged as leaders more often in brainstorming teams. Ellis (1988) and 
also Ellis et al. (1988) examined MBA student groups and found self-monitoring 
predicted emergent leadership. Zacaro et al. (1991) used a round-robin design and 
found that self-monitors emerged as leaders in several laboratory task groups. Flynn 
and Ames (2006) found self-monitors were peer-rated as more influential in MBA 
project teams. Extending beyond leader emergence in teams, Flynn et al. (2006) 
found that self-monitors attained higher status in MBA cohorts. It is worth noting 
that studies have found gender differences in the effect of self-monitoring; however, 
these effects are inconsistent across studies, with some showing stronger effects for 
men (Ellis 1988) and some for women (Flynn and Ames 2006; Garland and Beard 
1979).
</p>
<p>Why Do Self-Monitors Attain Higher Status? Of all the personality traits 
reviewed in this chapter, self-monitoring is probably the most relevant to the Mic-
ropolitics theory of status. As argued earlier, the attainment of status stems from 
being perceived as socially valuable. Individuals thus engage in micropolitical 
behavior in part by proactively striving to signal their value to the group&mdash;either by 
conveying their competencies or their collective-mindedness to others. High self-
monitors have the ability to ascertain which characteristics are socially valuable, 
and then modify their behavior to convey those characteristics.
</p>
<p>Specifically, research has shown that self-monitors desire status a great deal 
(Flynn et al. 2006; Fuglestad and Snyder 2010). They pay more attention to their 
social environment and are more accurate at reading it (e.g., Costanzo and Archer 
1989; Flynn et al. 2006; Funder and Harris 1986; Ickes et al. 1990). Their accuracy 
extends to characteristics that provide status; for example, Flynn et al. (2006) found 
that self-monitors understood the importance of generosity to status attainment. 
Furthermore, self-monitors are better able to modify their behavior to signal their 
social value to others (Lippa 1978; Snyder 1974). Flynn et al. (2006) also found that 
self-monitors establish a reputation of being generous by helping out others more 
and by refraining from requesting help from others.
</p>
<p>In addition to managing their impressions in a way that enhances their apparent 
social value, research suggests that self-monitors also tend to occupy positions in a 
social network that provide them with higher visibility and control over resources 
such as information and access to others. For example, Mehra et al. (2001) found 
self-monitors were more central in the social network of a high-tech firm. Oh and 
Kilduff (2008) also found that among Korean expatriate entrepreneurs in a Canadi-
an urban area, self-monitors tended to occupy positions of brokerage in their social 
network; that is, they had formed relationships with individuals who did not know 
each other. Much research has shown that occupying central, brokerage positions </p>

</p>
<p>enhances individuals&rsquo; visibility (Anderson and Shirako 2008) and provides the indi-
vidual with socially valuable information (Burt 1997).
</p>
<p>Narcissism
</p>
<p>Summary of Findings Narcissism is a complex of personality traits and processes 
that involve a grandiose yet fragile sense of self and entitlement as well as a preoc-
cupation with success and demands for admiration (see Morf and Rhodewalt 2001 
for a review). Studies that have begun investigating the effects of narcissism on 
status have found somewhat mixed results. On the one hand, some studies have 
suggested narcissists attain higher status than others: Paulhus (1998) examined 
student teams and found narcissism to predict peer-ratings of contributions to the 
group, performance, and effectiveness (all ratings highly associated with status) at 
the beginning of the group&rsquo;s formation. Similarly, Brunell et al. (2008) found nar-
cissism to predict emergent leadership in a group task.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, some studies have suggested narcissists do not attain higher 
status than others. In the aforementioned study by Paulhus (1998), narcissism did 
not predict those same peer-ratings 6 weeks later into the group&rsquo;s development. 
John and Robins (1994) found that narcissism was unrelated to peer-ratings of per-
formance in a group task. Anderson et al. (2008) also found that in a group task, 
narcissists did not achieve higher peer-rated status.
</p>
<p>Why Is Narcissism an Inconsistent Predictor of Status? As mentioned earlier, 
narcissism is not considered a single personality trait but rather a complex of per-
sonality traits. We believe narcissism has mixed effects on status attainment because 
some of the traits within the narcissism cluster help individuals attain higher status, 
while other traits hinder individuals&rsquo; ability to attain status.
</p>
<p>For example, narcissism involves a desire for status (Brunell et al. 2008), which 
drives many of the micropolitical behaviors that help achieve status (Anderson and 
Kilduff 2009). Perhaps more important, narcissism also involves a high degree of self-
confidence (e.g., John and Robins 1994), and self-confidence has been consistently 
linked with emergent leadership (for reviews, see Bass 2008; Judge et al. 2002; Stog-
dill 1948). In fact, studies have shown that confident individuals attain higher status 
regardless of whether their confidence is justified (Anderson et al. 2012; Kennedy 
et al. 2013). Why would self-confidence play a key role in status attainment? Research 
has shown that confident individuals engage in one important type of micropolitical 
behavior: they display more of the behavioral cues that signal competence to others, 
for example they speak more, use a confident and factual vocal tone, exhibit a calm 
and relaxed demeanor, and jump into group discussions early (Anderson et al. 2012). 
As a result, they are seen as more intelligent and competent (Kennedy et al. 2013).
</p>
<p>However, narcissism also involves behavioral habits that can harm status. As 
Paulhus (1998) notes, &ldquo;narcissists have an interpersonal style characterized by a 
competitive and domineering social presence (Morf and Rhodewalt 1993), which 
may be increasingly offensive over time.&rdquo; Indeed, narcissists tend to be more self-</p>

</p>
<p>focused and less concerned about others&rsquo; welfare. Because status is accorded to 
individuals who are more collectively oriented, narcissists&rsquo; selfishness likely harms 
their status.
</p>
<p>In support of this &ldquo;mixed blessing&rdquo; account of narcissism and its effects on status 
attainment, Paunonen et al. (2006) found that military cadets who possessed the 
&ldquo;brighter&rdquo; side of narcissism (i.e., self-confidence) were more often rated as leaders 
by peers. In contrast, cadets who possess more of the &ldquo;darker&rdquo; side of narcissism 
(e.g., manipulativeness) were not rated as leaders. Similarly, Cheng et al. (2010) 
found that narcissism predicted peer-rated dominance in college athletic teams, 
which involved a selfish, aggressive style of behavior aimed at furthering one&rsquo;s own 
goals. However, narcissism was unrelated to peer-rated prestige, which was focused 
on the respect and admiration individuals achieved in the eyes of peers based on 
their competence and value to the group (i.e., status).
</p>
<p>Summary and Conclusions
</p>
<p>The findings reviewed in this chapter provide strong evidence that personality traits 
are an important determinant of status attainment. Specifically, extraversion, domi-
nance, neuroticism, and self-monitoring appear to consistently predict status attain-
ment across diverse social and group contexts. Conscientiousness and narcissism 
can also facilitate status attainment, but their effects appear to be context depen-
dent. Some evidence suggested that openness to experience can sometimes be a 
determinant of status, though this evidence was somewhat weaker. Agreeableness, 
however, was not found to predict status attainment.
</p>
<p>How can we make sense of these findings? Why do some personality traits pre-
dict status attainment whereas others do not, and yet others predict status incon-
sistently? We sought to shed light on this literature using a recently proposed Mi-
cropolitics theory of status (Anderson and Kennedy 2012). In short, the evidence 
suggests that the personality traits that more strongly and consistently predict status 
attainment do so because individuals with those traits possess characteristics that 
provide value to the group, or because they engage in the micropolitical behaviors 
that enhance their value to the group in the eyes of others. For example, individuals 
with some personality traits tend to have better social and leadership skills; they 
engage in social activities more and develop a wider range of relationships with 
others; or they engage in behaviors that make them appear more competent, even 
when they are not.
</p>
<p>One broader take away from the current review is that personality should play a 
more critical role in theories of status. As was shown, personality traits&mdash;especially 
some traits&mdash;predict status attainment consistently and strongly. Alongside intel-
ligence and demographic characteristics such as race and gender, personality ap-
pears to be a driving force behind status-organizing processes. We hope the current 
review sparks interest in this intersection between personality and status so that we 
can better understand their important relationship.</p>

<p>Every winter, northern elephant seals living on the West coast of the United States 
and Mexico get ready for breeding season by establishing their rank. Pairs of males 
push themselves up on their front flippers and vocalize individually distinct calls 
to each other. If neither male accepts a submissive position following this con-
frontational display, a physical contest ensues. The winner of this fight receives a 
valuable reward; privileged access to mate with female seals. Such physical con-
tests occur on land and mostly consist of pushing and shoving each other, thereby 
utilizing their own bodyweight. Larger seals are more successful at winning these 
confrontations, as smaller seals are more likely to retreat or lose an ensuing physical 
fight. The loser of the contest recognizes his lower rank, and usually for the rest of 
the breeding season acts subordinately toward the winner (Haley et al. 1994). This 
process, which occurs to a certain degree in many species, establishes a hierarchy 
where some individuals obtain low status or rank, and others obtain high status or 
rank. Status or rank refers to the position in a hierarchy where those higher in status 
have relatively privileged access to fitness-enhancing resources, most notably food, 
mates, and territory (Henrich and Gil-White 2001).
</p>
<p>In humans, status hierarchies are sometimes formed by winning or losing antag-
onistic physical confrontations yet more often by less violent means. The biggest, 
baddest alpha may successfully enjoy high status in some specialized groups&mdash;for 
instance in violent gangs (Campbell 1984)&mdash;but in general our world leaders and 
billionaires did not get where they are by literally beating up their rivals. Humans 
have evolved various strategies to climb the ranks, many of which do not involve 
force, intimidation, and threat. High status is often granted freely to individuals who 
can somehow benefit the group by for instance sharing culturally relevant special-
ized knowledge or skill. The result is a status hierarchy based on prestige rather than 
on dominance as with the elephant seals (cf. Henrich and Gil-White 2001; Cheng 
et al. 2013; see Cheng and Tracy, Chap. 1, this volume). Despite the fact that human 
hierarchies seem more flexible we appear to share something in common with other </p>

</p>
<p>species. Across the human and animal world, bigger seems to be better, at least in 
terms of status. We refer to the association between cues of physical size and status, 
either real or perceived, as the status-size hypothesis and believe this connection 
may partially have a biological basis.
</p>
<p>In past research, physical stature or height has often been linked to status. Re-
search has shown that taller individuals are seen as higher in status, more dominant 
(Melamed 1992), and more leader like (Blaker et al. 2013). The reverse is also 
true: High status individuals are judged as taller (Wilson 1968). In terms of actual 
outcomes height has several status benefits, and it even provides an advantage in 
the US presidential elections (Stulp et al. 2013). In this chapter, we review the 
status&ndash;size relationship in several domains of human social interaction, and extend 
this research by discussing important moderators. The status&ndash;size connection de-
pends on what size cues are relevant, how status has been obtained, the sex of the 
targets, and finally on contextual cues. Some questions we address are: Do height 
and strength&mdash;both aspects of human size&mdash;differently affect status perception? Are 
dominant high status individuals perceived differently from prestigious high status 
individuals in terms of perceived size? Do children also associate status with size? 
Finally, is bigger always better in terms of status in both competitive and coopera-
tive environments?
</p>
<p>This chapter will focus strongly on perceptions of low and high status individ-
uals. We will begin by defining social status, explaining why humans are likely 
equipped with a mechanism which facilitates automatic and accurate assessment 
of others&rsquo; social status relative to their own, and shortly explain prestige and domi-
nance-based status. Secondly, we review literature on height and strength, two ele-
ments of human size. What status-related information do these size cues convey 
to the perceiver? Thirdly, we discuss how size relates to dominance, prestige, and 
to an important proxy of status, namely leadership. Additionally, we explore how 
contextual cues influence how status and leadership relate to physical size. In our 
discussion of status and size, we review much existing literature but also share some 
of our own recent findings from several experiments. We end with a discussion of 
the practical implications of a generic status&ndash;size perceptual bias, and propose av-
enues for future research on this topic.
</p>
<p>Status Assessment as Evolved Psychological Adaptation
</p>
<p>Living in groups brings many advantages for people. For instance, being in a group 
means that each individual is not completely reliant on him or herself for finding 
food and water, fighting off predators, or rearing offspring (reviewed in Rubenstein 
1978; Van Vugt et al. 2008). Yet group living also comes with the challenge of 
managing conflicts, building alliances, coordinating social activities, and negotiat-
ing status hierarchies (Van Vugt and Kameda 2012). To reap the benefits and avoid 
the costs of sociality, animal groups tend to form relatively stable status hierarchies, 
where some individuals have lower or higher &ldquo;ranking&rdquo; than others. In a social </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1216 The Status-Size Hypothesis: How Cues of Physical Size and Social Status &hellip;
</p>
<p>hierarchy, high ranking is typically reflected in increased privileges such as pref-
erential access to more or higher quality resources like food, territory, and sexual 
mates. Ranking within the hierarchy is also reflected in how individuals behave 
toward each other. Those with high status receive more submissive displays from 
lower ranking members (for instance grooming), whereas lower status members are 
more likely to be exposed to dominant displays from higher-status members.1 The 
consistent affording of privileges and showing of submissive or dominant displays 
reinforces and maintains relatively stable status hierarchies, where the individuals 
recognize their own and others&rsquo; rank. Such knowledge about individuals&rsquo; relative 
status facilitates group cohesion by suppressing conflicts over resources.
</p>
<p>Resources such as food, territory, and mates are not infinitely available or of the 
same quality, and dividing these resources among group members is a dilemma con-
sistently faced by many species, including humans (Van Lange et al. 2013). In the 
absence of a social hierarchy there would be disagreement and conflict each time a 
resource needs to be shared. Indeed, in the formation stage of a hierarchy there is a 
lot more conflict than in later stages, when ranking stabilizes and individuals to a 
large extent accept their own and others&rsquo; places (Long and Pellegrini 2003; Pellegri-
ni et al. 2007). Think of receiving a salary at work. Almost every organization has a 
hierarchy, where lower ranking employees are paid a lower salary than higher rank-
ing employees. This system is generally accepted by the employees, and conflict 
does not break out every time an employee sees that he or she is receiving a smaller 
share of money than certain others, perhaps because the employees recognize that 
some should receive more than others. For instance, it is seen as fair that those in 
leadership positions generally are afforded a higher salary, or that older employees 
receive more money because they have more experience. In short, members of a 
group have a general sense of who ranks where in a hierarchy and this functions as 
a stabilizing mechanism to facilitate social cooperation and group cohesion.
</p>
<p>In order to function in groups with status hierarchies, it is imperative that indi-
viduals agree to a certain extent who is ranked where. It is thus a requirement that 
individuals can make informed decisions to assess their own and other&rsquo;s social sta-
tus and to behave in ways appropriate for their status position. We suggest that in the 
same way as humans are equipped to make decisions about who to trust (i.e., cheat-
er detection) or which individuals are genetically related (i.e., kin detection) they 
have also evolved mechanisms to manage status hierarchies (Van Vugt and  Kameda 
2012). This status detection system includes mechanisms to extract relevant cues in 
the environment to assess their status and that of other individuals, mechanisms to 
behave in ways that are afforded by their status, mechanisms to improve their own 
relative status, and mechanisms to undermine the status of competitors. Like other 
</p>
<p>1 In human hierarchies these may not just be submissive-dominant displays, but also respectful 
displays. For instance some languages have different pronouns which are used to address indi-
viduals with more respect, such as older or high ranking individuals. In French, &ldquo;tu&rdquo; means &ldquo;you&rdquo; 
and is used to address peers and can be seen as disrespectful when used to address certain others, 
while &ldquo;vous&rdquo; also means &ldquo;you&rdquo; but is used to convey respect or is used in formal situations. This 
is related to prestige-based status, and will be discussed later on.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>mechanisms, status detection likely has a universal component which has evolved 
in response to certain selection pressures related to social life.
</p>
<p>Humans are of course not the only species with a status hierarchy, and status 
hierarchies evolved a long time before our species did. It thus seems reasonable to 
conclude that, at least to some degree, the human ability to gauge social status is 
the result of evolution and should be viewed as a biological adaptation. This does 
not necessarily mean that we are all simply born with a common knowledge of who 
is low or high status, but it at least means that we have evolved specific learning 
mechanisms which allow us to develop a reasonably accurate judgment of oth-
ers&rsquo; social status in adaptively relevant environments. As psychological adaptations 
are generally the result of complex gene&ndash;environment interactions we expect that 
different status cues will be relevant across different situations and even cultures 
(Tooby and Cosmides 1992).
</p>
<p>We recognize that for humans there are multiple strategies to obtain high  ranking 
within the hierarchy of a group, most notably via dominance or via prestige (Henrich 
and Gil-White 2001). In a dominance hierarchy, status is obtained through force, 
intimidation, and inducing fear. Individuals accept others&rsquo; dominant high status 
 because they are afraid of the consequences if they do not submit to the individual in 
the high status position. Dominance hierarchies are thought to be functional in set-
tling disputes over resources with the minimum amount of physical conflict (which 
can be very costly in terms of injury or death). Conversely, in a prestige hierarchy, 
those high in prestige-based status attain their ranking by so-called free  deference, 
which means that lower ranking individuals voluntarily accept their place and will-
ingly afford the higher-status individual their ranking. Usually prestige-based status 
is afforded because the prestigious individual has the potential to confer signifi-
cant benefits on individuals or groups, for instance, because they have a special 
 talent, skill or knowledge which can be transferred to others and used to the advan-
tage of others. Unlike dominance hierarchies, prestige hierarchies are thought to 
have evolved because they facilitate cultural transmission and social coordination. 
Those higher in prestige are leaders or role models who are more likely to be copied 
than those lower in prestige (Chudek et al. 2012).
</p>
<p>Since dominance and prestige are distinct evolved strategies for attaining high 
status in human groups and may be adaptive in different situations, it is reasonable 
to assume that their evolved social psychology also differs. Being able to accu-
rately assess an individual&rsquo;s dominance is imperative to avoiding physical harm, 
as it enables you to act submissively toward more dominant individuals who have 
the potential to overpower you. On the other hand, it also enables you to effectively 
seize opportunities to gain more or higher quality resources by coercing individuals 
whom you have the ability to successfully intimidate or beat in a physical confron-
tation. Accurately detecting highly prestigious individuals is just as important, but 
for a very different reason. Following prestigious conspecifics implies that you can 
gain culturally relevant knowledge or pick leaders of the highest available quality.
</p>
<p>Accurately assessing others&rsquo; status is thus an important ability which facilitates 
group coordination. In this chapter, we develop some specific predictions about the 
relationship between size and status perception, distinguishing between different </p>
<p/>

<p>1236 The Status-Size Hypothesis: How Cues of Physical Size and Social Status &hellip;
</p>
<p>aspects of size and whether status is obtained through dominance or prestige. We 
also look at different contexts to see if the bias holds in different settings and across 
samples of different ages.
</p>
<p>Two Components of Physical Size: Height and Muscularity
</p>
<p>An effective method for rapidly determining others&rsquo; position in a hierarchy is to 
draw information from directly observable morphological traits. Research has 
shown that we use an array of cues to determine someone&rsquo;s social status, which 
include voice pitch (Puts et al. 2007), facial appearance (Keating and Doyle 2002), 
body posture (Cashdan 1998), non-verbal emotional expressions (Tiedens 2001; 
Shariff and Tracy 2009), and physical attractiveness (Anderson et al. 2001; Kalick 
1988). Another important status cue is physical size; a contribution of this chapter 
is to recognize that physical size consists of various components that may convey 
different status information to perceivers. Humans come in different shapes and 
sizes, and when we refer to someone as &ldquo;big&rdquo; or &ldquo;small&rdquo; we can mean several dif-
ferent things. First, humans differ in vertical size&mdash;also known as stature or height. 
Secondly, size can refer to how broad (shoulder to shoulder), muscular, or robust an 
individual is. Height and muscularity are independent: Given two individuals with 
the same height, the one with more fat free muscle mass (FFM) will be perceived as 
bigger. Thirdly, size can refer to the amount of body fat, which we will not discuss 
in the current chapter for lack of empirical data.
</p>
<p>What does height signal and why do humans vary in height&mdash;what causes some 
individuals to be tall and others to be short? The simple answer is that someone&rsquo;s 
height is mostly determined by how tall their parents are, but the circumstances 
they grew up in also have a significant influence (Silventoinen 2003). Height has 
a heritability estimate of approximately 0.8&mdash;meaning that 80 % of the variation in 
height is due to genetic influences, whereas the remaining 20 % is determined by 
environmental factors. High quantity and quality of nutrition during development 
contribute to increased height, whilst disease during development generally stunts 
growth (Silventoinen et al. 2000; McEvoy and Visscher 2009). Thus, individuals 
growing up in wealthy, privileged environments generally have a better chance of 
growing to their full height potential than those who grow up in impoverished envi-
ronments. Height may therefore be an honest signal of status in general.
</p>
<p>Much research has shown that height is positively correlated with actual social 
status (controlling for gender as men are significantly taller than women across cul-
tures). For instance, height is positively associated with income (for a meta analysis 
and review see, Judge and Cable 2004). It is positively related to military rank 
(Masur et al. 1984) and authority status in the workplace (Gawley et al. 2009). 
Furthermore, individuals in managerial positions are on average taller than indi-
viduals in non-managerial positions (Egolf and Corder 1991), American science 
professors tend to be taller than the general public (Hensley 1993), and even the 
US  presidential election outcome is partially predicted by height of the winning 
candidate (McCann 2001; Stulp et al. 2013). There is also evidence that being tall </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>124 N. M. Blaker and M. van Vugt
</p>
<p>facilitates an individual&rsquo;s upward social mobility (Bielicki and Charzewski 1983; 
Bielicki and Waliszko 1992). There is also evidence that an individual&rsquo;s own power 
position affects their perceptions of height; individuals who were made to feel more 
powerful over-estimated their own height (Duguid and Goncalo 2012). Moreover, 
feeling more powerful leads to estimating other people as shorter than oneself, 
whereas feeling relatively powerless leads to estimating other people as taller than 
oneself (Yap et al. 2013).
</p>
<p>Like height, muscle strength has a strong genetic component, though heritabil-
ity estimates differ greatly between studies&mdash;some report an estimate lower than 
height&rsquo;s 0.8 and some show a similar heritability to height (see Perusse et al. 1987; 
Thomis et al. 1998; Huygens et al. 2004). However, its phenotypic expression is 
strongly dependent on current environmental factors. Muscle mass is determined 
predominantly by nutrition (specifically the amount of protein in an individual&rsquo;s 
diet; Deibert et al. 2004), hormonal influences (higher testosterone levels are related 
to more muscle mass; Griggs et al. 1989), and physical exercise (Jones et al. 1989). 
Like height, muscularity can serve as a signal of status, as high quality and quantity 
nutrition is necessary to sustain a large amount of FFM. Yet whereas height cannot 
be actively manipulated by the individual, muscularity can. Thus, height is perhaps 
a more honest signal of someone&rsquo;s fitness and social status, whereas muscularity 
mostly reflects someone&rsquo;s current status as its expression is highly susceptible to 
environmental influences throughout adult life.
</p>
<p>Unlike height, research on muscularity and actual social status is harder to find. 
There is some evidence that FFM is positively correlated with wages for males&mdash;
and in some cases females&mdash;which is attributed in the literature to a positive corre-
lation of muscle mass with physical health (B&ouml;ckerman et al. 2010; Wada and Tekin 
2010; Bozoyan and Wolbring 2011). However, while we can conclude to a certain 
degree that being tall positively affects social status, correlational studies on muscle 
mass and income do not show that being more muscular leads to actually obtaining 
higher status. Also, while there have been numerous studies over the past decades 
on the relationship between perceptions of height and (proxies of) social status for 
men and women (e.g., Dannenmaier and Thumin 1964; Wilson 1968; Lindeman 
and Sundvik 1994; Murray and Schmitz 2011; Blaker et al. 2013), literature on how 
muscle mass and perceived social status relate to each other appears to be scarce.
</p>
<p>In sum, both height and muscle mass are thus likely to convey status-related 
information to perceivers, as taller and more muscular individuals have likely been 
exposed to resource rich environments which are associated with high rank. Next, 
we break status down into prestige and dominance, and discuss how height and 
muscularity may relate differently to these status types.
</p>
<p>Physical Size and Dominant Status
</p>
<p>Dominance hierarchies&mdash;hierarchies where rank is established by intimidation, 
threat, and force&mdash;exist in many animal species and evolved long before humans 
did. We would therefore expect to see certain similarities in human dominance </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1256 The Status-Size Hypothesis: How Cues of Physical Size and Social Status &hellip;
</p>
<p> hierarchies and the dominance hierarchies of other species. Physical size has been 
linked to dominant status in many species. For example, larger male baboons tend 
to hold a higher dominance rank than smaller male baboons (Johnson 1987); moor-
hen that are relatively heavier than conspecifics living near them are more likely 
to control a larger territory (Petrie 1984); and larger size predicts winning a dyadic 
contest in for instance jumping spiders (Taylor et al. 2001) and crayfish (Pavey and 
Fielder 1996). The examples provided aim to illustrate the wide spectrum of species 
that show a correlation between size and dominance-based status.
</p>
<p>A general reason why size and dominant status are closely related is because 
physical size is a proxy of an animal&rsquo;s physical formidability and its resulting 
 Resource Holding Potential (RHP) (Parker 1974). Physical formidability is the rela-
tive ability for an individual to win a contest; either by winning an actual physical 
conflict or by a display of superior physical dominance which causes the opponent 
to retreat. Such contests are generally over valued resources, such as food, territory, 
and ultimately mates&mdash;hence the term Resource Holding Potential. If larger size 
contributes to fighting ability, and valuable resources are contested over by several 
individuals in a group, we can expect a hierarchy to form where the larger individu-
als gain privileged access to those valuable resources. Subsequently, the members 
of that hierarchy recognize other individuals&rsquo; status (partially) on the basis of their 
size, and act accordingly to prevent incurring costs such as physical injury.
</p>
<p>As noted above, physical size has been linked to dominance in numerous spe-
cies and we therefore should expect, based on arguments of evolutionary consis-
tency (either through convergent evolution and/or by homology) that size also 
predicts dominance perceptions in humans. Research has shown that humans have 
the ability to accurately gauge physical formidability&mdash;operationalized as physical 
strength and fighting ability&mdash;by judging photos of strangers&rsquo; bodies and faces. 
 Morphological cues that were used to obtain this information are related to physi-
cal size. Both height and muscularity predicted physical formidability ratings and 
actual physical performance (Sell et al. 2009). Because physical size is a highly 
 sexually dimorphic human trait (meaning that it differs greatly between the sexes, 
and in humans is much higher in males), height and muscle mass may be a more 
salient cue of status when exhibited by males than by females (Sell et al. 2012). 
Puts (2010) has pointed out the importance of male&ndash;male contest in shaping hu-
man psychology during our evolutionary history, and shows evidence that human 
males likely (physically) contested each other over access to females in ancestral 
environments. Even if physical contests are relatively rarely used today to settle dif-
ference and to decide rank, it could still possibly have an influence on social status 
(cf. mismatch hypothesis; Van Vugt and Ahuja 2010; Van  Vugt and Ronay 2013).
</p>
<p>There are many examples of research showing that height and muscularity are 
related to perceived physical dominance. For instance, men holding weapons are es-
timated taller and more muscular (Fessler et al. 2012). Additionally, a study among 
a small-scale Amazonian society in Bolivia showed that physical size&mdash;a composite 
variable containing height and bicep circumference among other things&mdash;was re-
lated to assessments of who would win in a dyadic fight (Von Rueden et al. 2008). 
There is some evidence taller people also behave more dominantly&mdash;Stulp et al. 
(2013) recently showed that taller men and women are less likely to yield to shorter </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>126 N. M. Blaker and M. van Vugt
</p>
<p>same-sex  individuals coming their way on a narrow path. Muscular individuals ad-
ditionally show higher levels of aggression (Gallup et al. 2010), act less egalitar-
ian (Price, Kang, Dunn, and Hopkins), and act more self-interested (Petersen et al. 
2013). Muscularity&rsquo;s association to testosterone may explain such effects.
</p>
<p>Physical Size and Prestige
</p>
<p>The above evidence shows that height and muscularity are related to dominance, 
but could taller and more muscular people also be seen as higher in prestige-based 
status? Some researchers argue that the so-called height premium&mdash;the fact that 
taller people earn more&mdash;is not caused by perceptions of dominance but by a posi-
tive correlation between height and cognitive ability. Height has been associated 
with intelligence, IQ, and cognitive ability in several studies (for an overview of 
this topic, see Case and Paxson 2006) and these are all desirable, high status quali-
ties in Western industrialized societies. This effect is partially explained by the fact 
that environmental factors leading to increased height also lead to increased cog-
nitive ability&mdash;for example, low exposure to disease and a sufficient quality and 
quantity of nutrition during development. Apparently this association is something 
 perceivers pick up on.
</p>
<p>We conducted an online study in which participants had to rate pictures of men 
and women dressed in formal business wear. Half of the participants saw pictures of 
a short man and woman, and the other half saw pictures of a tall man and woman&mdash;
the people shown on the pictures were identical except for their height, which was 
manipulated with digital imaging software. Participants were asked to judge the 
short and tall targets on intelligence, dominance, health, and leadership (e.g., &ldquo;This 
person looks like a leader). We found that taller men and women are judged to be 
more intelligent than their shorter counter-parts&mdash;as well as more dominant, healthy 
and leaderlike (Blaker et al. 2013). Another study also showed that taller women are 
seen as more intelligent (Chu and Geary 2005).
</p>
<p>Research on height and person perception suggests that people (in Western 
 countries) tend to attribute several positive traits to taller individuals. These include 
competence (Young and French 1996), charisma (Hamstra 2013), and intelligence; 
such traits are desirable qualities that may give individuals more prestige. Most 
research has been focused on perceptions of men, but positive traits are also attrib-
uted to tall women, such as being assertive, affluent, and ambitious (Chu and Geary 
2005). A gender difference concerning such positive perceptions is that taller men 
are seen as more physically attractive, whereas taller women are not ( Kurzban and 
Weeden 2005). Additionally, Schumacher (1982) showed that stereotypes people 
hold about successful individuals in Western society overlap strongly with stereo-
types of taller people, suggesting that we generally expect taller individuals to be 
more successful in society. These results strongly suggest that height may be a sig-
nal of prestige, at least in Western societies.
</p>
<p>Unlike height, muscularity appears to be unrelated to cognitive ability, whereas 
it predicts aggression and antisocial behaviour (Gallup et al. 2010; Price et al. 2011; </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1276 The Status-Size Hypothesis: How Cues of Physical Size and Social Status &hellip;
</p>
<p>Petersen et al. 2013). Muscularity may thus produce behaviors which are not always 
appropriate for high status individuals in a prestige hierarchy in which status is 
freely conferred. Studies have shown a negative correlation between prestige-based 
status and testosterone and aggression (Johnson et al. 2007). In most situations, we 
would not expect muscularity to correlate with prestige, or at least to have a stronger 
relationship to perceptions of dominance than prestige.
</p>
<p>To examine this we conducted two scenario studies in which we described low 
and high status targets to participants. The targets we described in the study had 
either attained their status via dominant tactics (force, intimidation, threat) or via 
prestige (having valuable knowledge and skills, and were freely afforded status by 
others). In one experiment&mdash;conducted in our psychology lab with 74 Dutch under-
graduate participants&mdash;we used a political setting where the low status individual 
supposedly worked as an assistant whereas the high status individual was a member 
of a political party (who either used dominance or prestige tactics to gain his sta-
tus). In a second online study using 179 US participants recruited via MTurk, we 
used a more abstract representation of status. We described groups of individuals 
playing a game where valuable points were distributed amongst the players, which 
could be earned through force (dominance) or offered to them by other players to 
help the group (prestige). Two players were described as having earned very few 
points, whereas two other players were described as having earned a high amount of 
points&mdash;one by being dominant and the other by having high prestige in the group.
</p>
<p>The results confirmed the status&ndash;size hypothesis. In both experiments, high sta-
tus individuals (both dominant and prestigious) were generally rated taller and more 
muscular than those with lower status, but there were clear differences between the 
highly dominant and prestigious individuals regarding estimated muscularity. The 
high status individual who had used a dominance strategy was estimated more mus-
cular than the high status individual who used a prestige strategy. However, as we 
expected, both prestige-based high status and dominance-based high status equally 
increased height estimations in comparison to the low status individual. Thus, in 
these studies height was positively related to prestige and dominance in an equal 
manner, but muscularity was more strongly related to dominance than to prestige.
</p>
<p>While previous research suggests a relationship between height and prestige, 
which our results conducted with Western samples support, there is reason to doubt 
that this is a universally occurring phenomenon. For instance, a study conducted 
among people of the Tsimane&mdash;a relatively egalitarian farming-foraging society in 
the Bolivian Amazon&mdash;shows that although individuals agree that taller adults are 
physically stronger, they do not perceive taller people as socially more dominant&mdash;
that is, when two people have conflicting interests, whose interests are acted upon&mdash;
or as more knowledgeable (Undurraga et al. 2012). Another study conducted in 
the Bolivian rain forest showed that physical size did not predict community-wide 
influence, a sign of prestige (Von Rueden et al. 2008). Considering that these null 
effects were found in relatively egalitarian societies, which reflects the conditions in 
our ancestral past, they suggest that perhaps a certain level of experience with  social 
inequality is required to associate height with prestige and good socioeconomic 
outcomes (cf. Stulp 2013). Perhaps in cases where inequality is less pronounced 
and variation in height is lower&mdash;as was presumably the case in ancestral human </p>
<p/>

<p>128 N. M. Blaker and M. van Vugt
</p>
<p>societies&mdash;individuals do not automatically associate height with prestige and so-
cial influence (although they may still associate height with physical dominance).
</p>
<p>This suggests that size&ndash;prestige perceptions are more malleable than size&ndash;domi-
nance perceptions. This may not be surprising because different cultures value dif-
ferent qualities in people. For instance, among the Inuit being a good fisherman 
might give someone social status, whereas among the Bedouin it might be an ability 
to move the group to a waterhole, in the Yanomamo being a good fighter, and in 
Western Europe having a high IQ. This suggests that unlike dominance cues, many 
cues of prestige are culturally learnt over time with implications for the relationship 
between size and prestige.
</p>
<p>To test this idea, in another set of studies, we gave participants descriptions of low 
and high status individuals (both high in dominance and prestige). Only this time the 
participants were not adults but Dutch primary school pupils aged 6&ndash;12. The children 
were asked to guess how tall low and high status characters in a story were by picking 
an illustration from a line-up of men with differing height and muscle mass&mdash;much 
like the adults did in our previous studies. We told the children a short story about 
an island where two kings lived in their respective castles at each end of the island, 
along with other people who lived in a few villages in between. The kings each ruled 
parts of the island. One king was feared by the people on the island and became king 
because no one dared stand up to him (this character represented high dominance), 
whereas the other king was supported by the people on the island and they wanted this 
king to rule (this character represented high prestige). The low status characters were 
a postman (study 1&mdash;with 59 participants aged 6&ndash;8) and a baker (study 2&mdash;with 237 
participants aged 6&ndash;12), and the high status individuals were the kings.
</p>
<p>Consistent with the adult samples we reported on before, children also rated the 
dominant high status target as taller and more muscular than the low status target. 
However, overall the results indicated that the children did not rate the highly pres-
tigious person as taller than the low status target&mdash;as adults had done in our two pre-
vious studies. Looking at the results per age group we found that two grades (grades 
3 and 5) showed a small effect of prestige on estimated height. Yet even in these 
cases the effect was small and was much weaker than the effect of dominance on 
estimated height. These results suggest that while dominance is something humans 
automatically connect to size and from an early age onward&mdash;as previously dem-
onstrated in infants aged 10&ndash;13 months (Thomsen et al. 2011)&mdash;the relationship 
between height and prestige develops later in life, presumably based on cultural 
learning and socialization.
</p>
<p>The Status-Size Effect in Context: Height and Muscularity 
</p>
<p>Predict Leadership Perception
</p>
<p>As indicated, unlike dominance traits, prestigious traits are at least to some degree 
culturally malleable. A researcher is likely highly esteemed for her intelligence by 
peers in the academic community, because she has relevant skills to be successful </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1296 The Status-Size Hypothesis: How Cues of Physical Size and Social Status &hellip;
</p>
<p>in that particular environment. However, this does not mean that everyone per-
ceives her as high in prestige. For instance, avid football fans will probably attribute 
higher prestige to the most skilled football player even if his intelligence turns out 
low&mdash;skills relevant in one domain do not necessarily transfer to others. Children 
learn who they should give prestige to. They are able to identify models with skills 
relevant only to a particular context, and pay more attention to them in order to pick 
the high prestige models to learn from as their &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; (Chudek et al. 2012).
</p>
<p>Does context determine who we give prestige to and are likely to follow as leaders 
and does that influence the relationship with physical size? Humans have evolved 
to function under circumstances of intense competition between groups as well as 
close cooperation within groups&mdash;two scenarios which require different behaviors. 
 Neuropsychological research has shown that we indeed show different patterns of 
neural activity when we cooperate with someone compared to when we compete 
with them (Decety et al. 2004). Generally, in order to be successful in a highly 
competitive intergroup environment it may be adaptive to follow a more physically 
dominant individual as leader. In contrast, when cooperation is required following 
a dominant leader may be counterproductive (Little and Roberts 2012). Previous 
research showed that voters prefer a more dominant masculine looking leader during 
war, and a more feminine looking leader during peace (Spisak et al. 2012).
</p>
<p>In line with such findings, we predict that physical size might affect who we 
pick as leaders during war or peace. Since muscularity appears to be a salient cue 
for physical strength, more muscular individuals may be seen as higher in prestige 
in conflict scenarios and may therefore be seen as appropriate war leaders. Taller 
individuals, due to their higher dominance and prestige, might be preferred as both 
war and peace leaders.
</p>
<p>The link between physical size and leader perception is theoretically grounded 
in implicit leadership theories which posit that we have a cognitive schema of what 
constitutes a typical leader. By repeatedly seeing that leaders tend to share certain 
characteristics we form this cognitive schema, and we categorize others as leaders 
to the degree that their traits overlap with those in our schema of a leader (Lord et al. 
1984). Evolutionary leadership theories (Van Vugt and Ronay 2013) further suggest 
that we may have evolved prototypes of leaders for different adaptive problems such 
as warfare and peacekeeping (King et al. 2009). Based on these ideas, we wanted 
to test the status&ndash;size hypothesis in cooperative versus competitive environments.
</p>
<p>We gave a description of a presidential election in a fictional country, Isilia, 
to an online sample of 418 US participants (average age: 34.85), and asked them 
to rate the potential leader candidates in the upcoming election on certain quali-
ties&mdash;these included ratings of prestige, dominance, and to what degree they looked 
like a typical leader (we used the peer prestige and dominance scales adapted from 
Buttermore 2006, by Cheng et al. 2010). These candidates differed in their height, 
muscularity, and gender. We used the free avatar-creating software MakeHuman to 
manipulate these traits, and turned the avatars into silhouettes using digital imaging 
software. Examples of the resulting stimulus materials can be found in Fig. 6.1. At 
the time of the election, the fictional country was either in conflict with its neigh-
bouring country over valuable natural resources or it was cooperating closely with </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>130 N. M. Blaker and M. van Vugt
</p>
<p>its neighbouring country to extract valuable natural resources&mdash;in this case the 
valuable resource was oil. Figure 6.2 depicts the general model we tested. Overall, 
the results showed that taller and more muscular candidates were seen as higher 
in status (dominance and prestige), and more suitable as leaders across the war 
and peace scenarios. However, interesting differences emerged between the male 
and female targets, and between the cooperative and conflict scenarios&mdash;especially 
concerning muscularity and prestige. We found that more muscular male candidates 
were seen as more prestigious in the war scenario, and subsequently were more 
likely to be seen as typical leaders. This effect was not found for males in the co-
operative scenario, and also not for females in either scenario. Height&rsquo;s effect on 
perceived status and leadership was far less specific, and in this particular sample 
occurred across scenarios and gender.
</p>
<p>In sum, height and muscularity increase perceptions of status and leadership 
which confirms the status&ndash;size hypothesis. Yet the size&ndash;prestige relationship de-
pends upon the nature of the situation. This is especially the case for muscular 
people whose prestige increased only during war for male targets, presumably be-
cause physical strength of a leader is a valuable instrument in intergroup conflict, 
certainly in ancestral times.

<p>1316 The Status-Size Hypothesis: How Cues of Physical Size and Social Status &hellip;
</p>
<p>Discussion and Future Research
</p>
<p>Previous literature and our own findings suggest that height and muscularity, 
though both cues of size and physical formidability, may signal different status-
related information to the perceiver. Whereas height is related to attributions of 
dominance- and prestige-based status across a number of situations, muscularity is 
much more a dominance indicator. However, in a situation where physical formida-
bility is helpful to the group&mdash;for instance in a conflict situation&mdash;muscularity may 
also signal prestige. Finally, whereas size&rsquo;s relation to dominance-based status may 
be a universal phenomenon, height&rsquo;s relationship to prestige (which we identified in 
several Western samples) may not be. Although we found that Dutch children aged 
6&ndash;12 associated dominance with increased height and muscularity like our adult 
samples do, we failed to replicate the effect of prestige-based status on estimated 
height among that sample.
</p>
<p>Individuals may only attribute prestige to taller individuals if they are exposed 
to an environment where inequality has caused a strong association between socio-
economic status and height (and a relatively high variation in height), like in most 
Western industrialized societies. This hypothesis could be tested in a fairly straight-
forward manner&mdash;we would expect to find that in populations with more varia-
tion in height there would be a stronger relationship between height and perceived 
prestige-based status. Also, we would expect to find a positive correlation between 
indicators of a population&rsquo;s inequality (measured by for instance the Gini coeffi-
cient, as used in Brooks et al. 2011), and the variation of height in that population.

</p>
<p>Almost 50 years ago, Haviland (1967) suggested that inequality can affect height 
in a population, using skeletal remains from burial sites at Tikal, Guatemala, pre-
viously home to an ancient Mayan society. As the structure of this Mayan society 
evolves from relatively egalitarian, to a division between rulers and commoners, 
and further into a society with individuals on a continuum from poor to rich, there 
is a marked change in height variation. In the oldest burial sites of pre-classical 
times around 50 B.C. where the oldest tomb burials were found, there was no dif-
ference in the stature of individuals buried in a tomb (which reflects a burial of 
someone important) and those individuals buried at regular sites. Then in early clas-
sical times, around 1 A.D., a marked difference in stature starts to emerge between 
those buried in tombs and those buried outside, likely reflecting the propagation of 
a hereditary ruling class. In later classical times this difference persists, and we also 
see increased variation in height among the &ldquo;commoners&rdquo; (i.e., those not buried in 
tombs), possibly reflecting increased complexity of Mayan society. This study of-
fers a nice example of how height variation can change depending on the level of 
inequality in a population.
</p>
<p>If an association between height and prestige is something individuals learn by 
experience, an interesting question is when exactly they start associating height and 
prestige. In our child sample, we found a small effect of high prestige on estimated 
height (though still much weaker than the effect of dominance on estimated height) 
in grades 3 and 5. One of our next experiments will look at how adolescents aged 
12&ndash;18 perceive highly prestigious individuals, and we would expect to see an in-
creasingly strong association between perceived height and prestige with age. Of 
course, a next important step would also be a cross-cultural examination of this 
development.
</p>
<p>By only discussing height and muscularity as indicators of physical size, we have 
currently ignored a third important size cue, namely amount of body fat. In the cur-
rent discussion, we excluded this size cue because we focused on something height 
and muscularity have in common, but does not necessarily apply to body fat&mdash;
height and muscularity are a proxy of physical formidability and therefore predict 
future resource attainment, while body fat is a reflection of past food intake but does 
not necessarily predict future Resource Holding Potential. The amount of body fat 
is a direct outcome of the amount of food taken in and therefore is indicative of easy 
access to food in a resource rich environment&mdash;by this logic body fat could possibly 
be a signal of high status. However, in industrialized societies where calorie-rich 
food is relatively abundant and easy to access, excess body fat has actually become 
associated with lower status&mdash;obesity is negatively related to  socioeconomic status 
in high-income societies. On the other hand, in low and middle income countries, 
obesity tends to be positively related to socioeconomic status (for a review on this 
topic, see McLaren 2007). It would be interesting to see whether body fat also leads 
to different perceptions of status across those different populations.
</p>
<p>We have touched on how the environment can influence how size and status 
are related to each other, by looking at the differential effects of cooperation and 
conflict. However, there may be many more situations where we show an adaptive 
response to by preferring bigger, stronger leaders. We could see in which other situ-
ations more muscular individuals are seen as higher in prestige and are  preferred </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1336 The Status-Size Hypothesis: How Cues of Physical Size and Social Status &hellip;
</p>
<p>as leaders. First, we would like to find out whether competition in general already 
 elicits an association between prestige and muscularity, or whether an element of 
specifically physical competition needs to be present (as was the case in the sce-
narios we used&mdash;i.e., war). If competition in general elicits the same response, this 
would have implications for corporations which operate in a very competitive en-
vironment, though not characterized by physical conflict. Another example of a 
context which may influence how perceptions of status and muscularity relate to 
each other is an environment exhibiting cues of resource scarcity, as for instance in 
the current economic crisis. In the face of scarcity and uncertainty, humans show an 
adaptive response in terms of mate choice (Little et al. 2007); an adaptive response 
to such environmental conditions could also be expected in terms of status and lead-
ership perceptions and preferences.
</p>
<p>Results from our own studies showed that people tend to attribute increased 
height to high status individuals regardless of which strategy that high status person 
used to obtain his position, but that muscularity is attributed more to those who use 
a dominance-based strategy rather than a prestige-based strategy. To test whether 
this effect exists outside the carefully controlled lab experiments, we could compare 
perceptions of existing leaders who use fear and intimidation to rule (for instance, 
dictators) versus existing democratically elected leaders. If the same mechanism is 
at work in this applied case, we should expect that both types of leaders are esti-
mated taller than the general public and as equally tall compared to each other, but 
that the dictator will also be estimated more muscular than the democratic leader.
</p>
<p>There are several other possible avenues of research. For instance, are leaders in 
certain traditional societies&mdash;who are often referred to as &ldquo;Big Men&rdquo;&mdash;really physi-
cally bigger than their followers? There have been suggestions this is the case (e.g., 
Sahlins 1963; Ellis 1992), but systematic data is scarce or non-existent. Also, is the 
disproportionate representation of Caucasian males in leadership positions partially 
due to the fact they are on average taller than other sub-populations in the United 
States and other Western countries? Although undoubtedly more powerful forces 
are at play which propagate this phenomenon, it is likely not helpful to women and 
ethnic minorities that they tend to be shorter on average than their Caucasian male 
counterparts in many Western countries.
</p>
<p>Height and muscularity are salient size cues which are related to attributions 
of status and leadership. We have tried to point out through a discussion of our 
own and others&rsquo; research that this status&ndash;size relationship is quite complex, and 
invites many novel and interesting research questions. The fact that many species 
share a similar connection between status and size suggests that this phenomenon 
is partially the result of evolution, which is further supported by research showing 
that infants and children already connect dominance with size. However, the con-
nection between height and prestige-based status may not be universal as there are 
examples of societies where increased prestige is not attributed to taller people, and 
our data additionally shows that children in the Netherlands do not estimate high 
status prestigious individuals taller than low status individuals. The environment 
can change how size and status influence each other, as can the gender of the target. 
We conclude that height and muscularity both contribute to perceptions of status 
and leadership, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Prosocial Behavior and Social Status
</p>
<p>Among the Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island, chiefs actively compete with one another 
for prestige by hosting elaborate feasts known as potlatches (Piddocke 1965). At 
potlatches, items of wealth like canoes and blankets are generously donated to other 
tribes, and &ldquo;rival&rdquo; chiefs must in turn host an equally elaborate or more expensive 
feast to avoid losing prestige. This example is far from unique: people across the 
globe use generosity as a route to social status, either directly as in the Kwakiutl or 
indirectly as a means of acquiring the material or social capital necessary for social 
success including status competition (reviewed by Barclay 2010a).
</p>
<p>By contrast, recent research suggests that high status people are less likely to 
be generous in several situations than low status people. Compared to low status 
people, high status people give less in experimental games, are less endorsing of 
charitable donations, and are more likely to endorse a number of unethical behav-
iors (Piff et al. 2010, 2012). Such results seem to contradict the suggestion that 
prosocial behavior is positively related to social status. What&rsquo;s going on?
</p>
<p>Social status and prosocial behavior are ubiquitous in human interactions, but it is 
not necessarily obvious how and why they should interact. Does prosocial behavior 
affect one&rsquo;s social status, and if so, when and to what extent? Or does one&rsquo;s social 
status affect one&rsquo;s prosocial behavior, and if so, does it increase or decrease pro-
sociality? The current chapter examines the interactions between social status and 
prosocial behavior, in both directions of causation: how prosocial behavior affects 
the acquisition of status, and how possession of status affects prosocial behavior. We

</p>
<p>will also discuss how (and why) the effects of status on prosociality depend on how 
status changes the costs and benefits of prosociality by affecting factors like people&rsquo;s 
(in)dependence, vested interest in group members, ability to be prosocial, and desire 
to maintain status. Before diving into the details, we must first define &ldquo;status&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;prosociality&rdquo; and explain why we should predict that they will affect each other.
</p>
<p>What is Status? Why Connect Social Status  
</p>
<p>and Prosociality?
</p>
<p>Social status includes, but is not limited to, constructs such as socioeconomic status 
(SES), social class, resource-holding potential, and social influence. Broadly de-
fined, it refers to the influence one has over group decisions and over the distribution 
and use of valuable resources, such as food, territories, mates, and coalition partners 
(reviewed in Cheng et al. 2010). These resources are essential for survival and re-
production, so controlling them results in higher-status individuals having higher 
reproductive fitness in humans and other primates (e.g., Mealey 1985; Nettle and 
Pollet 2008; Pusey et al. 1997). Natural selection &ldquo;designs&rdquo; organisms to strive 
for and desire things that positively impact reproductive success (e.g., food, sex, 
and safety), so it should be no surprise that the pursuit of status is pervasive in hu-
man (and nonhuman) social life (see the other chapters in this volume). Of course, 
people need not be aware of any link between status and reproduction: status mo-
tives are a proximate mechanism that triggers behavior within the individual, but the 
ultimate function of possessing those motives (i.e., the reason why those motives 
evolved in primates) is because possessing high status brings survival and repro-
ductive benefits (see Tinbergen 1963 for this distinction between proximate and 
ultimate causes, see also Scott-Phillips et al. 2011).
</p>
<p>Prosocial behavior refers to acts that increase the well-being of other individu-
als, often at a cost to oneself. Why connect this with status? There are at least two 
reasons. Firstly, prosocial behavior can be used to help achieve status. Researchers 
distinguish between two types of status: dominance, which typically involves the 
imposition of costs on others; and prestige, which typically involves the distribution 
of benefits to others (Henrich and Gil-White 2001; Cheng et al. 2013; see Cheng 
and Tracy, Chap. 1, this volume). We will argue that prosocial behaviors like gen-
erosity, public service, and enforcement of group norms can be used to increase 
or maintain status by either: (1) leading directly to prestige-based status, and (2) 
directly resulting in material gains which will later affect how successful one is at 
either type of status competition (dominance or prestige). Table 7.1 outlines some 
of these ways that prosociality results in material gains.
</p>
<p>A second reason to connect status and prosociality is that possessing status can 
change the costs and benefits of engaging in prosocial behavior. For example, some 
forms of cooperation can help the cooperator avoid punishment; if high status 
individuals are able to avoid punishment due to their status, they may have less 
need to engage in those forms of cooperation. One specific case of this is with tax </p>

<p>Table 7.1  People who help others can benefit in a number of ways, as outlined by the theoretical 
concepts below (reviewed by Barclay and Van Vugt in press). These can all affect the acquisition 
of status either directly (e.g. acquisition of prestige), or because the return benefits from helping 
others will put the helper in a better position later when competing over status in more traditional 
ways. People need not be aware of these benefits when they help. The explanations below are not 
mutually exclusive, because more than one concept may be involved in the explanation for a given 
phenomenon. For each of the theoretical rationales below, we also outline potential connections 
with status, especially ways in which the possession of status could change the costs and benefits 
for helping

</p>
<p>avoidance: paying taxes contributes to group benefits, and failing to pay taxes can 
result in fines and punishment, but for rich individuals or corporations it is more 
cost-effective to avoid both taxes and punishment by hiring accountants to find tax 
loopholes, lawyers to defend against legal charges, and/or lobbyists to influence tax 
legislation. Table 7.1 outlines a variety of ways that status can alter the relevant costs 
and benefits for different kinds of prosociality (see also Barclay and Reeve 2012).
</p>
<p>These two links between prosociality and status&mdash;using prosociality to achieve 
status and status affecting the cost/benefit ratio for prosociality&mdash;can help explain 
the apparently discrepant findings described at the outset of this chapter. Let us 
examine each of these links in turn.
</p>
<p>Helping in Order to Gain Status
</p>
<p>Evolutionary theory identifies many ways that those who help others may benefit 
from doing so (see review in Barclay and Van Vugt in press). For example, those 
who help others are more likely to receive help when in need themselves (Trivers

<p>1971; Nowak and Sigmund 2005). Helping may also communicate information 
about the helper&rsquo;s ability or willingness to confer benefits upon others, such that 
people choose helpers as partners and allies and/or avoid them as enemies (e.g., 
Barclay 2013; Smith and Bird 2000). Alternately, helpers may have a vested interest 
in the well-being of those who they help, perhaps because they rely on the recipients 
in some way (e.g., Roberts 2005; Tooby and Cosmides 1996). Table 7.1 outlines 
various ways in which helpers could benefit from their actions (for a full review, 
see Barclay and Van Vugt in press). These returns put helpers in a better position to 
compete with others over status, and sometimes directly lead to an increase in pres-
tige. Do these strategies work, and do people who help more tend to receive higher 
status? Below we review laboratory and field data from various disciplines, such as 
economics, psychology, and anthropology, which suggests that they do.
</p>
<p>Field Data
</p>
<p>Big game hunters from diverse traditional societies receive more reproductive ben-
efits than nonhunters (e.g., Hill and Kaplan 1988; Smith et al. 2003; Smith 2004). 
For instance, the Ache, who hunt big game in Paraguay, share their hunted meat 
with members of the tribe, and the best hunters have more sexual partners than 
other men do (Hill and Kaplan 1988). Similarly, among the Meriam turtle hunt-
ers from the Torres Strait, hunters who share turtle meat have higher reproductive 
success: Hunters, compared to age-matched nonhunters, have earlier first mating 
experiences, more children, and have access to more desirable females (Smith et al. 
2003; Smith 2004). Hunters even purposefully aim their hunting efforts toward dif-
ficult targets to advertise desirable qualities (i.e., physical and resource-acquisition 
abilities), and compete among each other for the title of best hunter, to gain status 
within the community (Hawkes and Bliege Bird 2002; Smith and Bird 2000).
</p>
<p>Much like the Kwakiutl potlatches, various other traditional societies regularly 
engage in ceremonies to showcase a tribe&rsquo;s status. Numerous New Guinean tribes, 
such as the Metlpa, Enga, and Gawil, perform elaborate exchanges during rituals 
known as mokas (Brown 1978). In order to signal a tribe&rsquo;s wealth and status, large 
pigs are exchanged. Pigs must be in mint condition to avoid humiliation and de-
crease in status: A tribe able to give away several large and fattened pigs effectively 
advertises their access to highly indispensable resources. Such exchanges are ex-
tremely important not only for the group but also for the individual (Brown 1978). 
After the exchange, pigs are cooked and served in a large feast where males often 
propose marriage to females of neighbouring tribes. If a male&rsquo;s tribe contributes too 
few pigs, or small pigs, to the moka exchange, then the loss of a tribe&rsquo;s reputation 
could result in the rejection of marriage initiations. Thus, generosity during elabo-
rate ceremonies, such as mokas and potlatches, can serve as a means for tribes to 
boost, or maintain high, social status.
</p>
<p>The previous three examples have focused on prosocial actions signalling re-
sources and/or physical ability as a means to status. Actions that simply signal 
one&rsquo;s good character can also result in reputational benefits. For example, the Shuar </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>144 S. Kafashan et al.
</p>
<p>people of Ecuador highly value helpful contributions to community engagement 
(Price 2003). In fact, the more one gives to the community (via attendance of com-
munity meetings, offered labour for community based needs, and years worked in 
the community public office), the more the individual is perceived to have high so-
cial status. These high status individuals relish in their ability to place sanctions on 
those who fail to contribute a fair share to the community, and are deemed kind and 
altruistic for their generous role in collective action (Price 2003). Altogether, these 
various field examples show that people can gain status and reputational benefits by 
signal access to resources, physical abilities, or simply one&rsquo;s good character.
</p>
<p>Laboratory Evidence
</p>
<p>Across the globe, generosity is not only prominent in the field but also within labo-
ratory settings. Henrich et al. (2001), for example, conducted a cross-cultural study 
that examined prosocial behavior in fifteen small-scale societies, including herders, 
horticulturalists, and agriculturalists from twelve countries across five continents. 
Participants played an anonymous one-shot ultimatum game, whereby one partici-
pant (a &ldquo;proposer&rdquo;) was given a set amount of money equivalent to one or two 
days&rsquo; wages, and was asked to divide this amount with another participant (the 
&ldquo;responder&rdquo;). A &ldquo;proposer&rdquo; could offer any amount to his/her partner, and if that 
&ldquo;recipient&rdquo; were happy with the offer, he/she would accept it and both participants 
were allowed to keep the money. If the recipient deemed the offer unfair, however, 
he/she could reject it and both parties would leave empty handed. Instead of acting 
out of rational self-interest, whereby the &ldquo;proposer&rdquo; would offer the least amount 
possible and the recipient would accept any amount of money (because any amount 
of money would be better than leaving with nothing), participants across societies 
consistently made nontrivial offers to their partners. Additionally, participants in 
some societies made hyper-generous offers. Follow-up studies have shown similar 
results with other measures of prosocial behavior (Henrich et al. 2006, 2010). Such 
results initially appear to be irrational, but could be expected when viewed in light 
of evidence of the status benefits associated with prosociality (e.g., Barclay 2004; 
Hardy and Van Vugt 2006; Price 2003; Van Vugt and Hardy 2010; Willer 2009).
</p>
<p>Multiple laboratory studies show that prosocial people tend to receive social 
benefits from others. One way to demonstrate this is to give people the opportunity 
to act positively or negatively toward helpers. For example, Barclay (2004, 2006) 
had participants play a cooperative game where people could contribute money 
toward a group fund which benefited all group members, and then allowed partici-
pants to entrust money to other participants based on their reputations. People who 
contributed more to the group fund were entrusted with more money than people 
who contributed less. Similar results have been found by other researchers (e.g., 
Clark 2002; Milinski et al. 2002a; Semmann et al. 2004; Van Soest and Vyrastekova 
2004). People who contribute toward their groups are also chosen more often as in-
teraction partners (Barclay and Willer 2007; Sylwester and Roberts 2010), preferred 
as leaders (Milinski et al. 2002b), rated as more desirable partners for long-term </p>

<p>1457 Prosocial Behavior and Social Status
</p>
<p>relationships (Barclay 2010b), and are perceived to be trustworthy and have high 
social status (e.g., Barclay 2004; Hardy and Van Vugt 2006; Price 2003; Van Vugt 
and Hardy 2010; Willer 2009). Uncooperative people tend to receive verbal criti-
cism or even more tangible punishment (e.g., Barr 2001; Fehr and G&auml;chter 2002; 
Yamagishi 1986).
</p>
<p>For helping to be a useful means of acquiring status, other people must be aware 
of the help. If status motives underlie helping behavior, we should expect people to 
be more cooperative when information about their actions will be available to oth-
ers. Indeed, the tendency for generosity or cooperativeness to decline as anonymity 
increases is well established by theory and evidence from economics (Hoffman 
et al. 1994; Andreoni and Petrie 2004; Rege and Telle 2004), psychology (Kurzban 
2001; Barclay 2004), biology (Barclay and Willer 2007; Milinski et al. 2002a, b; 
Sylwester and Roberts 2010; Wedekind and Milinski 2000), and political science 
(Bixenstine et al. 1966).
</p>
<p>Even exposure to a subtle cue of observation, an image of watching eyes, has 
been shown to increase generosity (Haley and Fessler 2005; Mifune et al. 2010; 
Oda et al. 2011; Rigdon et al. 2009; Nettle et al. 2013), contributions to publicly 
shared resources (Burnham and Hare 2007), and condemnation of theft and decep-
tion (Bourrat et al. 2011). This &ldquo;eyes effect&rdquo; seems to be motivated by a concern 
for reputation (Oda et al. 2011) and has also been shown to affect various forms 
of real world cooperation, including charitable donations (Ekstr&ouml;m 2011; Powell 
et al. 2012), garbage clean-up (Ernest-Jones et al. 2011; Francey and Bergm&uuml;ller 
2012), and donations to a public good (Batson et al. 1997). The eyes effect emerges 
most reliably when there are fewer real observers around (Ernest-Jones et al. 2011; 
Ekstr&ouml;m 2011; Nettle et al. 2013) and may not last very long (Sparks and Barclay 
2013). Despite these limits, strategic placement of reputation cues may be an ef-
fective way to increase cooperation in otherwise anonymous settings (see Barclay 
2012 for a discussion).
</p>
<p>People can gain status not only by giving or helping others but by enforcing 
norms of cooperation. Many researchers have noted that people contribute more 
to their groups when noncontributors can receive punishment. But why expend the 
cost and effort to punish others? Barclay (2006) used a cooperative group game 
to show that people readily paid to punish those who do not contribute toward a 
group fund that benefited all group members, and that the people who paid such 
costs were perceived by other participants as being more respected, trustworthy, and 
group-focused than nonpunishers. Those who punished noncontributors were also 
entrusted with more money, demonstrating a tangible benefit for enforcing norms 
(see also Nelissen 2008).
</p>
<p>With the benefits gained from a prosocial reputation, it is not surprising that re-
cent evidence has shown individuals actively competing to be more generous than 
others, a notion known as competitive altruism (e.g., Barclay and Willer 2007; Rob-
erts 1998; Sylwester and Roberts 2010). Barclay and Willer (2007) found evidence 
of competitive altruism by having participants complete a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma game 
in groups of three. In the first round, two of the three participants (i.e., participant 
A and B) engaged in a one-time cooperative task where each could donate money 
to the other at a cost to oneself, with any donations increasing in value (a &ldquo;simul-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>146 S. Kafashan et al.
</p>
<p>taneous gift-exchange&rdquo;). In the second round, the third participant (i.e., participant 
C) did this same cooperative task with one of the other two (i.e., with either par-
ticipant A or B) in one of three experimental conditions: Participant C was either 
(1) randomly assigned a partner and given no information of the partner&rsquo;s behavior 
in the previous round, (2) randomly assigned a partner and informed of the part-
ner&rsquo;s behavior in the first round, or (3) allowed to choose a partner after gaining 
knowledge of the behaviors of potential partners in the previous round. Barclay and 
Willer (2007) showed that participants A and B escalated their levels of prosocial 
behaviors when participants C were able to choose partners. Using an almost identi-
cal experimental design, Sylwester and Roberts (2010) found similar results in that 
participants were less prosocial when individuals were randomly assigned partners, 
and most generous when interaction partners were explicitly chosen. These studies 
show that individuals will compete to be more generous than others whenever it 
will affect their reputation and their access to social partnerships (for a review, see 
Barclay 2013).
</p>
<p>Priming Status Motives
</p>
<p>Some research has also examined how people behave when status motives are ac-
tivated experimentally (e.g., Griskevicius et al. 2009). Consistent with the idea of 
competitive altruism, this research finds that a desire for status can lead people to 
become more prosocial and self-sacrificing, such as by choosing prosocial products 
(Griskevicius et al. 2010). For example, consider the reason why over a million 
Americans have bought a Toyota Prius, a popular Hybrid gas-electric car. In one 
study Prius owners were asked &ldquo;What was your primary motivation for buying the 
Prius?&rdquo;, and the overwhelming majority&mdash;66 %&mdash;said they bought a Prius because 
they wanted to be environmentally friendly (Topline 2007). But while many people 
say they purchase green products such as the Prius to do good for the environment, 
a consideration of competitive altruism suggests that rather than seeking to help 
Mother Nature, consumers might instead be seeking to help themselves&mdash;by going 
green to be seen.
</p>
<p>To test this idea, researchers had people choose between two cars&mdash;a luxurious 
nongreen model and an equivalently priced but less luxurious green Hybrid; the 
latter sported an enticing &ldquo;H&rdquo; (for Hybrid) to publicly proclaim the owner&rsquo;s pro-en-
vironmental concern and awareness. Before people made their choices, though, the 
researchers activated status motives in half of the participants. These subjects read a 
short story in which they imagined arriving for their first day at a high-powered job, 
where they would be competing with several others for an opportunity to move up 
into a prestigious corner office; this story had been used in previous experiments to 
cause people to seek the things that would get them status (Griskevicius et al. 2009). 
The study revealed that status motives had a dramatic influence on people&rsquo;s car 
choices (Griskevicius et al. 2010). Without a desire for status (in the control condi-
tion), most people chose the top-of-the-line combustion car model over the dinkier 
Hybrid. But when status was activated, people&rsquo;s choices reversed. More than half of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1477 Prosocial Behavior and Social Status
</p>
<p>the status-minded people chose the Hybrid. In fact, these go-getters also preferred 
other green products such as ecologically friendly dishwashers and recycled back-
packs over their conventional counterparts.
</p>
<p>Why did a desire for status lead people to forgo luxury and go green? Is it be-
cause these upward-bound risers were somehow inspired to be altruistic and self-
sacrificing for the environment? Not exactly. Instead, a second study found that a 
status motive led people to go green only if they could show off their green wares 
to others (Griskevicius et al. 2010). If your neighbors could not easily see the sac-
rifices you&rsquo;re making to help the planet, then it was not worth it. The &ldquo;going green 
to be seen&rdquo; studies suggest that many choices that appear altruistic often belie a 
deeper desire for status that comes from appearing altruistic. From this perspective, 
a Prius is essentially a mobile billboard conspicuously advertising the owners&rsquo; pro-
social green concerns. Other studies have found similar results in different domains 
of helping: for example, being primed with romantic motives causes women to 
report more willingness to engage in prosocial behavior like volunteering to help 
others, and causes men to report more willingness to engage in heroic helping such 
as rescue others from dangerous situations, but this only appears when such acts are 
conspicuous (Griskevicius et al. 2007).
</p>
<p>Applications
</p>
<p>Consideration of competitive altruism suggests that people are particularly moti-
vated to compete for status through prosocial and environmental behaviors that can 
signal self-sacrifice. A key component of harnessing the desire for status to benefit 
the environment (for example) is that environmental acts need to be visible to others 
(e.g., Barclay 2012). For example, recall that status desires motivated people to seek 
green products only when someone was around to see it. This suggests that firms or 
organizations should provide people with visible signs or tags for choosing proso-
cial options, so that people can clearly display their self-sacrificing acts.
</p>
<p>Competitive altruism also suggests that a particularly effective strategy to 
facilitate prosocial behavior is to publicize lists that rank the greenest or most phil-
anthropic companies, celebrities, or ordinary citizens. Media mogul Ted Turner, for 
example, once bemoaned the influence of the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans, 
pointing out that this publicized list discouraged the wealthy from donating to char-
ity for fear of slipping down in the rankings. Perhaps it was not a coincidence that 
a public list of top philanthropists&mdash;the Slate 60&mdash;was established the very same 
year that Turner publicly pledged 1 billion $ to humanitarian relief. Similar types 
of publicized lists of &ldquo;least polluting companies&rdquo; in India have been remarkably 
effective at motivating firms to voluntarily reduce pollution (Powers et al. 2008), 
suggesting that people worldwide are willing to engage in self-sacrificing behavior 
to avoid appearing at the bottom of a status hierarchy.
</p>
<p>Consideration of competitive altruism also has implications for the pricing of 
green and other types of prosocial products. This perspective suggests that some-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>148 S. Kafashan et al.
</p>
<p>times increasing the price of a green product can lead that product to become more 
desirable because it signals that purchasers are prepared to incur costs. For example, 
after US tax credits for the pro-environmental Toyota Prius expired, sales increased 
by 68.9 % (Toyota 2008). Although this increase might have been even larger had 
the tax incentive remained, pundits were similarly bewildered by Lexus&rsquo;s decision 
to begin selling a hybrid sedan priced at more than $ 120,000. Yet again, sales of 
the pro-environmental and ultra-expensive Lexus LS600h exceeded projections by 
more than 300 % (Ramsey 2007).
</p>
<p>When green products are cheaper than their nongreen counterparts, their desir-
ability can decrease because such products might convey to peers that their owners 
cannot afford more expensive alternatives (Griskevicius et al. 2010). This means 
that making some green products cheaper, easier to buy, and more time-saving might 
undercut their utility as a signal of environmentalist dedication. A similar argument 
holds for all other types of socially responsible products. There is a careful balance 
between making such products expensive enough to serve as conspicuous signals 
of status, yet cheap enough to be usable by more than just the elite. For example, 
companies may wish to develop two lines of green products: an expensive line to 
appeal to the wealthy, and a cheaper line to appeal to as many others as possible (es-
pecially for privately consumed products). When it comes to applications, the idea 
of competitive altruism presents many fruitful directions. Whereas competition for 
status has often been viewed as an unsavoury endeavour, the same thirst for status 
can be channelled to facilitate socially beneficial rather than wasteful behavior. For 
example, encouraging competition on pro-environmental outcomes might motivate 
people and firms to voluntarily adopt more sustainable practices.
</p>
<p>Helping (or Not-Helping) as a Consequence of Status
</p>
<p>Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost 
always bad men.&mdash;Lord Acton
</p>
<p>The previous section described how prosocial behavior can be a means of accessing 
the material and social rewards that accompany elevated status, and how status-
seeking can motivate prosocial behavior. Having already examined how prosocial 
behavior affects status, we now reverse the causal arrow and examine how status 
affects prosocial behavior.
</p>
<p>Does achieving higher status change people&rsquo;s behavior? Experimental econo-
mists Ball and Eckel (1998) artificially conferred high status on half of their par-
ticipants by presenting them a gold star in an award ceremony. After this simple 
manipulation, higher status players received better offers in bargaining simulations. 
In market games, higher status buyers paid lower prices and higher status sellers 
received higher prices. Ball and Eckel (1998) concluded: &ldquo;the economic value of 
status is that it changes everyone&rsquo;s expectations about what is a reasonable outcome 
of an economic game&hellip; a mere star induces subjects to behave differently, even 
when it is awarded based on transparently random criteria.&rdquo; (p. 511) (see also Ball 
et al. 2001).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1497 Prosocial Behavior and Social Status
</p>
<p>Why would a mere star change someone&rsquo;s behavior, let alone change behavior 
so reliably that everyone expects it? Such a simple cue probably changes people&rsquo;s 
expectations about what others will demand and will grant, and helps form a focal 
point for people to coordinate their behavior around (a focal point is any salient 
point that people naturally converge on when solving coordination problems; see 
Schelling 1960). Status differentials may be a common way to solve coordination 
problems (Eckel et al. 2010). On a deeper level, this simple manipulation is a win-
dow into a psychology that is powerfully designed for negotiating status relations 
and their effects on what one can and cannot do. In this section, we discuss how 
status changes the costs and benefits of social behaviors, and along the way we 
review and integrate evidence from several disciplines about the effects of status 
on prosocial behavior. The literature shows that possessing status can increase or 
decrease prosocial behavior, depending on how it affects the costs and benefits of 
prosociality.
</p>
<p>We will discuss four examples of ways in which possessing status can affect 
the costs and benefits of prosociality (and thus affect levels of prosociality): by af-
fecting people&rsquo;s dependence on others, their vested interest in others, their ability 
to be prosocial, and their need for status maintenance. There are many other ways, 
however, that possessing status could change the costs and benefits and benefits 
of prosociality. For example, unstable status hierarchies create greater opportunity 
costs for investing in prosociality instead of status competition, and thus increase 
high-ranking people&rsquo;s tendencies to manipulate group members (Barclay and Be-
nard 2013). The costs and benefits of prosociality may also be different for status 
based on prestige versus dominance.
</p>
<p>Conceptual Links Between Status and Social Behavior
</p>
<p>(In)dependence
</p>
<p>Greater resource access affords high status individuals more freedom and indepen-
dence in the pursuit of their goals. By contrast, limited control of material and social 
resources leaves low status people more dependent on others to fulfill their needs 
and wants. As such, status-based differences in social dependence are associated 
with differences in social cognition, social emotion and social behavior, including 
prosocial behavior.
</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s outcomes depend on forces outside of his/her direct control, then 
he/she would benefit from being more aware of social situations (and the influence 
of situations on behavior). Accordingly, lower-status people are more attentive to 
context and are more likely to favour contextual explanations of outcomes than are 
high-status people, who tend to endorse dispositional explanations (Krauss et al. 
2009). Social context is especially important, because with heightened vulnerability 
to external forces and dependence on others comes a greater need to understand 
others&rsquo; goals and feelings. Psychologists employing a variety of correlational and 
experimental methods have shown that lower status people are better at gauging the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>150 S. Kafashan et al.
</p>
<p>emotional and mental states of others (Snodgrass 1985, 1992; Galinsky et al. 2006; 
Thomas et al. 1972; Rutherford 2004). Krauss et al. (2010) found that low socio-
economic status was significantly associated with greater accuracy in identifying 
the emotions experienced by another participant during a mock job interview. The 
extent to which each participant used contextual explanations on an unrelated task 
was an even better predictor of their accuracy in identifying emotions than their 
socioeconomic status, which supports the contention that differences in empathetic 
accuracy associated with status are caused by differential attention to the social 
environment (Krauss et al. 2010).
</p>
<p>So, material circumstances and personal control influence social cognition and 
emotion such that higher status people tend to be more self-oriented, and lower status 
people more other-oriented, in their thoughts and feelings (Krauss et al. 2011). Piff 
et al. (2012) hypothesized that these tendencies would lead to predictable differences 
in antisocial behavior as a consequence of status. A series of experimental and cor-
relational studies confirmed that higher class individuals are more likely to perform 
or endorse unethical behaviors including lying in negotiations, cheating to win cash, 
cutting off other drivers in violation of traffic laws, taking candy from children, and 
engaging in unethical business practices. Similar logic may explain why men with 
dominant facial and vocal characteristics are more unethical and aggressive (Hasel-
huhn and Wong 2012; Puts et al. 2012): those more capable of pursuing their goals in-
dependently derive less benefit from considering and acting on the interests of others.
</p>
<p>Antisocial behavior does not necessarily imply a lack of prosocial behavior, so 
we need to explicitly ask: do the same patterns hold for prosocial behavior as for an-
tisocial behavior? Because high status individuals are generally more independent, 
we should expect they&rsquo;ll be less attentive to the needs of others and thus engage 
in less helping behavior. Piff et al. (2010) found support for this hypothesis in a 
series of four studies, finding (1) people reporting lower subjective SES gave more 
money to an anonymous partner, (2) those who were experimentally made to feel of 
a lower social rank more strongly endorsed charitable donations than those made to 
feel higher ranking, (3) lower educational attainment and annual household income 
was significantly associated with more egalitarian social values and more trusting 
behavior in an economic game, and (4) people reporting lower past and current in-
comes assigned less work to a distressed partner (taking on more of it themselves) 
than wealthier individuals. These studies establish a clear association between high 
status and reduced prosocial behavior.
</p>
<p>Vested Interest
</p>
<p>Being part of a social group is valuable, and so people directly benefit from efforts 
to preserve the existence of their groups (Barclay and Benard 2013; Kokko et al. 
2001; Lahti and Weinstein 2005; Reeve and H&ouml;lldobler 2007). Within groups, those 
of higher status claim a disproportionate share of group benefits by definition (Hen-
rich and Gil-White 2001; Reeve and Shen 2006) and thus are disproportionately 
harmed by threats to the group. As a consequence, they may benefit more than low </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1517 Prosocial Behavior and Social Status
</p>
<p>status individuals from helping behaviors that preserve group stability and viability, 
such as vigilance, group defense, and enforcement of group norms. In addition to 
receiving disproportionate benefits, high status individuals may have more kin in 
their groups, either because those kin helped them to attain status (Chagnon 1997) 
or because they used their status to produce more offspring (Mealey 1985; Nettle 
and Pollet 2008). This higher relatedness to group members&mdash;when present&mdash;could 
also cause high status individuals to be more prosocial than low status individuals. 
We look forward to tests of these predictions.
</p>
<p>This prediction&mdash;that greater vested interests will cause high status people to 
help more than low status people&mdash;might seem to contradict the evidence presented 
earlier that high status people help less because the former are more independent. 
There is no theoretical contradiction here. Instead, we are pointing out how two 
different forces&mdash;vested interests versus independence&mdash;can push in opposite di-
rections (Barclay and Reeve 2012). The relative importance of vested interests and 
independence will vary across situations and with different kinds of prosociality. If 
cooperation is the only way to manage threats to the group, threat conditions will re-
duce or eliminate the relative independence of goal-pursuit that higher status people 
normally enjoy; the champ might have many more ways to feed himself or find a 
mate than the chump, but the only way either can survive an impending massive 
attack by their hostile neighbors is through highly coordinated collective defense. 
Also, the tendency for high status people to be less considerate of the interests 
of others and more self-focused is less of an obstacle to helping when everyone&rsquo;s 
interests are aligned. The interaction of such forces requires more theoretical and 
empirical investigation.

<p>By definition, people with higher status enjoy privileged access to money, educa-
tion, and valuable social institutions. Those who control more resources can deliver 
the same objective quantity of help at a lower personal cost (i.e., a lower percentage 
of their total resources), which may make them more likely to provide that help 
(Barclay and Reeve 2012). For example, if a person pays lower costs for providing 
a public good because of a greater ability, then that person is more likely to provide 
the public good (Diekmann 1993). Also, high status primates are more likely to 
intervene in others&rsquo; conflicts than low status primates, because the former are less 
likely to get hurt doing so (Silk et al. 2004). We should predict that whenever pos-
sessing status results in a greater ability to help others at a lower personal cost, we 
should predict that high status people will provide more help (all else being equal).

<p>Status Maintenance

<p>We&rsquo;ve discussed how prosocial behavior can be a means to increase one&rsquo;s status. 
Similarly, dispensing valued help can aid high status individuals maintain their  </p>

</p>
<p>privilege. Group leaders who are insufficiently generous are often criticized by 
group members, which can lead to a loss of status (Boehm 1999). After all, subor-
dinates will only follow a leader if they gain by doing so (Van Vugt 2006), so if a 
leader does not share then it will reduce others&rsquo; willingness to follow him/her.
</p>
<p>Noblesse oblige refers to a social norm obliging powerful people to act benevo-
lently toward those less privileged. Fiddick et al. (2013) conducted a cross-cultural 
study investigating the noblesse oblige phenomenon. Their experiment asked par-
ticipants to imagine themselves in a hypothetical carpooling arrangement between 
a (high status) factory boss and his (low status) employee in which one of the indi-
viduals was withholding the agreed-upon fuel contribution. Participants who were 
asked to the take the boss perspective were more tolerant of the noncompliance and 
more willing to continue the arrangement than those taking the employee perspec-
tive. Another study paired German children attending schools of varying levels of 
prestige for a &ldquo;Dictator Game&rdquo; (i.e., one person is given money and decides how 
much to share with a recipient). The naturally occurring status differences were 
highly predictive of generosity: the students of the highest status schools displayed 
noblesse oblige toward students of less prestigious schools; ingroup favoritism also 
occurred but was less evident in pairings with less pronounced status differences 
(Liebe and Tutic 2010; Fiddick et al. 2013).
</p>
<p>Earlier we showed evidence that high status people were less generous (because 
their independence makes them less attentive to the needs of others). The noblesse 
oblige phenomenon involves more generosity (e.g., tolerance of noncompliance, fi-
nancial donations) by high-status individuals, but only in situations where status dif-
ferentials are clearly invoked. Once again, higher status people seem to be more dis-
criminating helpers. That noblesse oblige serves a status maintenance function seems 
consistent with other anthropological findings. If this noblesse oblige only comes out 
when pre-existing status differentials are clearly invoked, then we should also pre-
dict that reactions to noblesse oblige will depend on how clear the status differentials 
are. People should resent it when others attempt to inappropriately display noblesse 
oblige if there is no clear pre-existing status differential, given that one person&rsquo;s gain 
in status is someone else&rsquo;s loss in relative status (Barclay 2013). Refusing others&rsquo; 
generosity may be a strategy for resisting the unwarranted imposition of inferior sta-
tus (Henrich et al. 2005; see also Nadler and Halabi 2006; Zahavi and Zahavi 1997).
</p>
<p>Summary, Conclusions and Applications
</p>
<p>We started with the question of whether prosociality affects social status, or vice 
versa. The evidence shows that the causation is bidirectional. Laboratory and field 
evidence both show that prosociality can be used to gain or maintain prestige, or 
to acquire the material and social capital necessary for status competition. Once 
acquired, possessing status then changes the costs and benefits for engaging in pro-
social behavior, for example because possessing status will affect one&rsquo;s level of 
independence and vested interests in fellow group members, one&rsquo;s need for recip-</p>

<p>1537 Prosocial Behavior and Social Status
</p>
<p>rocation from others, or one&rsquo;s ability to be prosocial. When we see how possessing 
status can increase some benefits of prosociality (e.g., by increasing vested inter-
ests) while reducing others (e.g., less dependence on others means less to gain from 
helping), it becomes clear that status will be positively associated with prosociality 
in some contexts and for some types of prosociality, yet negatively related with pro-
sociality in other contexts. We should predict that when a particular type of benefit 
is particular salient in a given context, then it will carry more weight in terms of af-
fecting behavior. We must also remember that there are many types of prosociality, 
each with different benefits, performance costs, and opportunity costs, so variables 
like status can affect them all differently (Barclay and Reeve 2012).
</p>
<p>How can we use this knowledge? Two possibilities are immediately obvious. 
The first is to alter the cost-benefit ratio for prosocial behavior for all individuals, 
not just high status persons, as possessing status is just one way to affect costs and 
benefits. The second is to provide opportunities for people to gain a good reputa-
tion for prosocial behavior, as this increases prosociality. For example, we can use 
status motives to promote sustainable products and responsible consumerism. This 
will require greater visibility and branding of such products, and finding the fine 
balance between status symbols for the wealthy and products available to the most 
people possible. We may even try to incite competitive altruism by explicitly com-
paring the generosity of different individuals, giving the most recognition to the 
most generous individuals (e.g., expanding the Slate 60 list of philanthropists), and 
allowing opportunities for the most generous individuals to selectively assort with 
each other. When status is based on prestige, we can demand noblesse oblige from 
those of high status as a condition of granting them prestige. There are of course 
risks and unknowns with harnessing the power of reputation (see Barclay 2011, 
2012), and these require careful consideration and further study, but the possible 
gains are immense.

<p>Many theorists in psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and other 
disciplines have viewed social status as a fundamental feature of social life not 
only among human beings but among other social species as well. In fact, several 
perspectives view status as one of the two basic dimensions that characterize social 
behavior, personality, and interpersonal relationships (Leary 1957; Wiggins 2003).
</p>
<p>Most research on status has examined the implications of high and low status 
for behavior, reactions of other people, interpersonal relationships, and various out-
comes, starting at the point at which a person already has or does not have status 
(Anderson and Kilduff 2009; Fiske 2010; Fiske and Berdahl 2007). Some work has 
examined social and personal factors that predict whether people have low vs. high 
status, but far less attention has been devoted to how people who desire to have 
status pursue it. The focus of this chapter is on the ways in which people who wish 
to increase their status seek it in their interactions with other people.
</p>
<p>Our analysis of the pursuit of status begins with a discussion of the nature of sta-
tus and its social psychological underpinnings. We then discuss the central role that 
self-presentation plays in the pursuit of status, the primary ways in which people 
enhance their status self-presentationally, and the features of social situations that 
moderate the ways in which people manage their status-relevant public images. We 
then turn to the dilemma that people sometimes face in balancing status and accep-
tance and discuss reactions to having low status.

<p>The Nature of Social Status
</p>
<p>Conceptualizations of status are as muddled as almost any in psychology. At vari-
ous times, writers have conceptualized status as having power, being esteemed or 
respected by other people, ranking high in a status hierarchy or pecking order, hav-
ing authority over other people, being dominant, or having prestige (Anderson and 
Kilduff 2009; Fiske 2010; Fiske and Berdahl 2007; Henrich and Gil-White 2001; 
Magee and Galinsky 2008). Although one can see the connections among these con-
cepts, they are by no means the same thing. For example, a person may have power 
over others by virtue of possessing the capacity to harm or destroy them, yet those 
individuals would not necessarily consider such a diabolically powerful person to 
have high status. Similarly, high-ranking people are sometimes detested and their 
efforts resisted, so they lack esteem, respect, and even influence.
</p>
<p>Part of the difficulty in conceptualizing status has arisen from the fact that so-
cial and behavioral scientists have approached status in quite different ways. So-
ciological perspectives have generally taken a structural approach in which status 
is regarded as a property that is conferred on people by virtue of their position 
in a social structure or hierarchy. Some people&mdash;such as those who are educated, 
wealthy, belong to certain racial or ethnic groups, or inhabit a formal position of 
authority&mdash;have greater status than those who are uneducated, poor, members of 
marginalized groups, or have no authority. In contrast, psychological perspectives 
have taken an interpersonal approach, asking why certain people in any group are 
accorded greater status than other people. Of course, structural factors provide part 
of the answer, but from a social psychological standpoint, status dynamics are as-
sumed to play out in the interpersonal relations among people. Thus, status arises 
from an interaction of social context, relationship variables, and the individual&rsquo;s 
personality. As a result, a particular person might be accorded high status by certain 
members of a group but not by other members for reasons that have nothing to do 
with structural considerations.
</p>
<p>Instrumental Social Value
</p>
<p>In our view, the essential foundation of status lies in what we will call instrumental 
social value (or, more precisely, perceived instrumental social value). People are ac-
corded status to the extent that others believe that they possess resources and/or per-
sonal characteristics that are important for the attainment of collective goals. People 
who, for whatever reason, are seen as promoting collective outcomes&mdash;and thus ben-
efitting both the group as a whole and its individual members&mdash;are accorded greater 
status than people who are not seen as promoting collective outcomes to the same 
degree. Thus, status is not a property of an individual but rather a consequence of be-
ing perceived as having instrumental social value. A person may be perceived to have 
high value&mdash;and thus high status&mdash;in one group but low value and status in another. 
Nor is status a property of a particular position in a group or society because people 
who occupy what might appear to be a &ldquo;high status&rdquo; position might not, in fact, be </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1618 The Pursuit of Status: A Self-presentational Perspective on the Quest &hellip;
</p>
<p>viewed by other people as providing valuable outcomes for the group. Such people 
might have a high rank or high power without high status. Even so, people who hold 
high status positions are often accorded higher status either because they earned their 
position by promoting collective outcomes or because mere possession of a high sta-
tus position leads others to infer that the person possesses resources or characteristics 
that reflect instrumental social value, whether or not that is actually the case.
</p>
<p>The unit of analysis for ascribing status can be as large as a society (even a global 
society) or as small as a dyad. People who are widely recognized as playing impor-
tant roles in the affairs of a society often enjoy wide-ranging status. War heroes, 
highly effective political leaders (particularly in times of crisis), astronauts and oth-
er explorers, great scientists and inventors, and other luminaries are often accorded 
status wherever they go. To a lesser extent, people in so-called high status profes-
sions&mdash;such as being a physician or judge&mdash;are likewise accorded status because 
they are seen as being broadly important to society. In organizations, teams, and 
task-oriented groups, status is directly related to the degree to which members are 
perceived to contribute to collective outcomes. (And, again, this is only indirectly 
related to members&rsquo; formal positions or titles.) Even in dyadic relationships&mdash;such 
as friendships and romantic relationships&mdash;one person may have more status than 
the other by virtue of playing a more important role in the dyads&rsquo; positive outcomes. 
Although most people may wish their closest relationships to be free of status dif-
ferences, many close relationships show status effects that are due to the relative 
instrumental social value of the two individuals.
</p>
<p>Conceptualizing status in terms of instrumental social value helps to clarify the 
relationship between status and the concepts with which it has been confused. For 
example, status is not the same as power, influence, or authority even though people 
with higher status generally do have greater social power and influence. As we de-
scribe in detail momentarily, people may be seen as important to a collective cause 
for many reasons&mdash;by virtue of possessing important competencies and skills, 
owning important resources, displaying a high degree of effort and loyalty, and 
so on. Such people are viewed as having greater status&mdash;and given greater influ-
ence&mdash;because of an implicit norm indicating that people whose skills, resources, 
and personal characteristics benefit the group should be accorded greater respect 
and influence. Whether the high status person is an effective leader, the most skilled 
member of an athletic team, or the member of the local garage band who owns the 
band&rsquo;s equipment, norms dictate that those who benefit from the person&rsquo;s contribu-
tions accord him or her respect and influence.
</p>
<p>In addition, some of the same characteristics and resources that confer status are 
also directly related to the person&rsquo;s ability to exert power. The rest of the band must 
obviously defer to the member who owns the equipment when decisions regarding 
practices and performances are being made; the possession of resources can give 
one status and power simultaneously. Likewise, when status is based on leadership 
effectiveness, as it often is in business organizations and military units, the person 
often reached a formal position of authority by virtue of the same traits that lead 
followers to accord him or her status. Thus, conceptualizing status in terms of per-
ceived instrumental social value helps to explain the myriad factors that predict the 
emergence of status.</p>

<p>162 M. R. Leary et al.
</p>
<p>Relational Value
</p>
<p>Instrumental social value must be distinguished from another form of positive social 
evaluation. Relational value refers to the degree to which a person regards his or 
her relationship with another individual as personally valuable and important (Leary 
2001). People regard their many interpersonal relationships&mdash;with friends, family 
members, co-workers, acquaintances, romantic partners, or whoever&mdash;as differen-
tially valuable. Some of our relationships are exceptionally valuable and important 
to us. We put a great deal of effort into these treasured relationships, are strongly 
affected by the good and bad fortunes of the people whose relationships we value, 
and are distressed when problems arise in those relationships or, worse, they come 
to an end. Other relationships are less valuable. Although we may enjoy certain 
relationships, we do not make a special effort to sustain them and would not be par-
ticularly troubled if they ended. Some of our relationships have no relational value 
whatsoever; although we may have an ongoing, interdependent connection with a 
person, we may not regard our relationship with him or her as important or valuable.
</p>
<p>Relational value is based on the psychological and emotional importance of a 
relationship almost without regard for the person&rsquo;s instrumental usefulness in help-
ing us to accomplish goals. Of course, friends, romantic partners, and family mem-
bers&mdash;classes of people who generally have the greatest relational value&mdash;often 
provide positive tangible outcomes and help us achieve various goals and, thus, 
they may have instrumental value. Yet, our relationships with such people are usu-
ally not predicated on their ability to help us attain those goals. In fact, many people 
who have very high relational value&mdash;such as one&rsquo;s children&mdash;do not provide any 
instrumental outcomes and sometimes exact considerable personal costs.
</p>
<p>Relational value and instrumental social value differ in several ways. First, 
they are based on different criteria. Relational value is based on personal socio-
emotional importance; instrumental social value is based on the person&rsquo;s value in 
achieving collective outcomes. Second, their affective and evaluative concomitants 
differ. Whereas relational value is associated with liking, instrumental social value 
is associated with respect. Third, in most cases, people whom we relationally value 
are not easily interchangeable with others who could serve their instrumental func-
tions, whereas someone with high instrumental value may be quickly replaced by 
another person who has the same instrumental characteristics or resources. And, 
finally, high and low relational value is relevant to the degree to which people are 
accepted vs. rejected, whereas high and low instrumental social value is relevant to 
the degree to which people have high versus low status.
</p>
<p>The Interplay of Instrumental Social Value and Relational Value
</p>
<p>The distinction between instrumental social value and relational value maps on 
to the interpersonal circumplex popularized by numerous social, personality, and 
clinical psychologists (Kiesler 1983; Leary 1957; Moskowitz 1994; Wiggins 1982). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1638 The Pursuit of Status: A Self-presentational Perspective on the Quest &hellip;
</p>
<p>Circumplex models specify that two fundamental dimensions underlie a number of 
social and psychological phenomena, including social relationships. These dimen-
sions have been characterized in slightly different ways by various theories, yet they 
share a common theme. One dimension has been characterized in terms of status, 
dominance, control, or power, and the other has been characterized in terms of love, 
affection, affiliation, or warmth (see Kiesler 1983). From our standpoint, any social 
encounter or interpersonal relationship can be characterized in terms of the degree 
to which each individual is perceived as having instrumental social value (status, 
respect) and relational value (acceptance, liking).
</p>
<p>According to Blau (1960), these two dimensions are fundamentally important 
because they reflect the two primary routes to social integration. People are at-
tracted to those who facilitate collective goals (i.e., have high instrumental social 
value) on one hand and those who are warm, likeable, and personally responsive 
(high relational value) on the other. Thus, having either instrumental social value 
(status) or relational value (acceptance) increases the likelihood that a person will 
be sufficiently rewarding to be included in others&rsquo; activities, groups, and other af-
fairs. But, although they are both routes to social integration, the basis of status and 
acceptance are different.
</p>
<p>Of the two dimensions, acceptance is arguably the more important overall be-
cause one&rsquo;s relational value to another person generally spans specific contexts and 
provides more broadly essential resources (such as companionship, support, and 
care) than status, which is usually tied to particular contexts and provides less vital 
outcomes. A person who was widely liked and accepted but who had low status 
would typically fare better in life overall than a highly respected person with high 
status who was not relationally valued, liked, or accepted by anyone. Of course, be-
ing both liked and respected usually provides greater benefits than either one alone, 
so people are inclined to pursue both acceptance and status.
</p>
<p>The Centrality of Self-Presentation in the Pursuit of Status
</p>
<p>As noted, we do not view status as either a property of a person or a position but 
rather as an inference that others draw or a social designation that they confer. Based 
on their judgments of an individual&rsquo;s contributions to collective outcomes&mdash;his or 
her instrumental social value&mdash;people accord the person a certain amount of status.
</p>
<p>Status sometimes accrues without the person intending to accumulate it. As peo-
ple contribute to collective outcomes, they may passively accrue status because of 
their instrumental social value. For example, a particularly fair-minded, judicious, 
and loyal group member may accrue status as other members come to recognize 
the important role that he or she plays in the group. Similarly, a particularly skilled 
member of an athletic team will gain status among other team members without 
making any special effort to do so.
</p>
<p>At other times, however, people actively pursue status and purposefully engage 
in behaviors to show others that they possess characteristics or resources that entitle </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>164 M. R. Leary et al.
</p>
<p>them to status. For example, a group member may volunteer to do certain tasks or 
participate in group discussions specifically to gain status rather than to help the 
group per se. Similarly, a member of an athletic team may show off his or her skills 
in ways that may increase his or her perceived instrumental social value. A person 
may inform others of (or even lie about) characteristics or resources that have im-
plications for his or her value to the group.
</p>
<p>Given that people attain status only to the extent that other people believe that 
they have instrumental social value, people who desire to increase their status attend 
to how their value is perceived by others and occasionally try to convey impressions 
of themselves that will bolster it. As Blau (1960, p. 546) observed, &ldquo;a person who is 
motivated to attain an integrated position in a group has strong incentives not simply 
to wait until others discover his good qualities but to exert effort to prove himself an 
attractive associate&rdquo; (p. 546). Thus, the pursuit and maintenance of status necessar-
ily require attention to one&rsquo;s image in the eyes of other people as well as occasional 
efforts to manage one&rsquo;s impressions with respect to instrumental social value.
</p>
<p>Self-presentation&mdash;the intentional effort to control the impressions that other 
people have of an individual&mdash;has often been portrayed as a deceitful and manipu-
lative effort to convey public images of oneself that one knows are not true, and 
sometimes it is (Buss and Briggs 1984). Yet, although people sometimes project 
public images that do not reflect how they see themselves, more often, they manage 
their impressions in order to show others that they possess certain characteristics 
that they actually do possess (Schlenker 1980, 2012). Just as advertisers accurately 
describe the properties of a product that might not otherwise be discernible by con-
sumers (&ldquo;&hellip;has half the calories of regular beer&rdquo;), people often take steps to make 
their characteristics known. Because other people may not have information about 
them that would create the desired impression, people work to ensure that relevant 
personal information is public knowledge. Thus, self-presentations are often tacti-
cal, but they are not necessarily deceitful (Schlenker 2012).
</p>
<p>As noted, people who wish to increase their status often monitor and control how 
they are viewed with respect to attributes that qualify and disqualify them for status. 
To consider the role that people&rsquo;s public images, and thus self-presentations, play 
in the pursuit of status, let us consider the image-relevant dimensions that are most 
relevant to status. The particular images that lead others to confer status on a person 
differ across groups and contexts, but a few broad dimensions underlie most instanc-
es in which people are viewed as having instrumental social value and, thus, status.
</p>
<p>Competence
</p>
<p>First, status is often based on judgments of the person&rsquo;s competence in domains that 
are important to the observer. No matter what domain of ability one might imagine, 
those who value competence in that domain will accord higher status to those who 
are particularly skilled than to those who are not. All other things being equal, more 
highly skilled athletes have higher status&mdash;both among teammates and fans&mdash;than 
those who are less skilled. Highly accomplished, widely published scientists have </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1658 The Pursuit of Status: A Self-presentational Perspective on the Quest &hellip;
</p>
<p>higher status than less accomplished ones. Among gang members, more skilled fight-
ers are accorded higher status than poor fighters, and so on. Experimental research 
clearly shows that people&rsquo;s beliefs about another person&rsquo;s competence predict the 
degree to which they believe that the person has high status (Anderson et al. 2012c)
</p>
<p>In light of the importance of competence to status in many contexts, people who 
desire greater status not only want to possess relevant knowledge and skills but 
they also want to ensure that their skills and successes are known by others and that 
their shortcomings and failures remain hidden. Thus, self-presentations involving 
knowledge, competence, and skill&mdash;what Jones and Pittman (1982) referred to as 
&ldquo;self-promotion&rdquo;&mdash;figure prominently in the pursuit of status. No one who desired 
status would make a point of advertising his or her ineptitude in areas that were 
important to the audience.
</p>
<p>An indirect route to being viewed as competent is to convey an air of confi-
dence. Because competent people are, on average, more confident than less com-
petent ones, observers sometimes use confidence as a proxy for competence (Areni 
and Sparks 2005; Price and Stone 2004). In fact, when people are induced to be 
overconfident, observers infer that they have higher status (Anderson et al. 2012c). 
Thus, people who speak more in group discussions, use a confident tone of voice, 
speak first, display a calm and confident demeanor, and provide more information 
that is relevant to the discussion are viewed as more confident and of higher status 
(Anderson et al. 2012c). In general, anxious, insecure, and introverted people are 
probably accorded less status because they are (unfairly) perceived to be less com-
petent than calm, secure, outspoken people (Anderson et al. 2001).
</p>
<p>This effect may be partly responsible for the relationship between dominance 
and status. More dominant people may tend to have greater status because they are 
viewed as more competent than less dominant people (Anderson and Kilduff 2009). 
For example, perceptions of status are influenced by nonverbal behaviors such as 
eye contact, initiating touch, and facial expressions that indicate confidence and 
dominance (Edinger and Patterson 1983; Hall et al. 2005). Evidence suggests that 
this pattern arises because people ascribe greater competence to dominant people.
</p>
<p>Obtaining and Displaying Resources
</p>
<p>Second, instrumental social value is higher for people who possess resources that 
promote desired collective outcomes. These resources may be almost anything that 
benefits&mdash;or might potentially benefit&mdash;other people. The family with the only 
swimming pool in the neighborhood accrues status from allowing neighbors to take 
a dip. The kids with the coolest toys and videogames derive status from sharing 
their playthings. The teenager with a car gains status over peers without one. Hav-
ing money to spend on other people or to facilitate group outcomes can buy status. 
One study showed that people who contributed more money to a group were per-
ceived as having higher status than people who contributed less. Not surprisingly, 
they were also more influential and engendered more cooperation on the part of 
other group members (Willer 2009).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>166 M. R. Leary et al.
</p>
<p>Because possessing certain resources can help people attain status, people some-
times seek possessions explicitly to increase their perceived instrumental social 
value. Many such things are directly relevant to status because they provide benefits 
to other people or to groups. For example, certain personal possessions can directly 
benefit other people in one&rsquo;s groups. Owning a printing shop that can produce need-
ed material for the group, having a large house where the group can meet, or owning 
other possessions that facilitate the group&rsquo;s goals can increase status.
</p>
<p>Other status-enhancing possessions do not benefit other people directly, but they 
demonstrate that the person possesses resources that might benefit others in the fu-
ture. The mere possession of money or luxury possessions may not have instrumen-
tal value to others at the present time, yet people who display signs of wealth often 
have status because they have the potential to benefit others. People appear to be 
willing to accord wealthy people a certain amount of status as an investment toward 
the possibility of attaining desired outcomes from them in the future. As a result, 
people who foster the image of having instrumental social value may not actually 
behave in ways that provide instrumental social value.
</p>
<p>Along these lines, Van Vugt and Hardy (2010) demonstrated that, even when 
people&rsquo;s contributions to a public good were not actually useful, people gave more 
when their contributions were public than private, presumably to be viewed as the 
kind of person who could have instrumental social value when needed. Further-
more, observers rated those who contributed more as having higher status and in-
fluence even when their contribution was not actually useful to the group. The link 
between being seen as having the potential for instrumental social value and being 
accorded status helps to explain why people sometimes display their wealth and 
engage in conspicuous consumption.
</p>
<p>Promoting Collective Goals
</p>
<p>Third, people can increase their status by directly benefitting groups and their mem-
bers. For example, people increase status by serving on the boards of universities, 
nonprofit agencies, and community groups; organizing events; volunteering for 
tasks; sacrificing their time; donating money; tutoring or helping others. Directly 
helping a group to achieve its goals contributes to perceived instrumental social 
value in two ways. First, it promotes collective outcomes, thus benefitting the group 
and its members, which by definition is the crux of instrumental social value. In 
addition, performing duties on behalf of the group demonstrates that one is a loyal 
group member who devotes effort on behalf of the group (to be discussed below).
</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, members who feel peripheral in a group try to demonstrate 
their instrumental social value in public ways rather than helping in private ways 
that are not known by other group members (Okimoto and Wrzesniewski 2012). 
People who are marginal group members are less likely to volunteer for the good 
of the group if their efforts will not be made known to the group than if their ef-
forts will be known publicly. Thus, peripheral group members&rsquo; self-presentational 
concerns manifest primarily in public contexts in which they can demonstrate their </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1678 The Pursuit of Status: A Self-presentational Perspective on the Quest &hellip;
</p>
<p>social instrumental value to fellow group members by promoting the collective 
goals of the group.
</p>
<p>Likewise, leaders who more effectively address the needs of other people foster 
perceptions of competence and credibility, enhance trust, and gain power (Blass 
and Ferris 2007). In addition to the specific knowledge and skills required to pro-
mote collective goals, people who possess &ldquo;political skill&rdquo; (e.g., social astuteness, 
behavioral flexibility, adaptability) more effectively address a variety of individual 
needs and promote individual and group goal accomplishment. Thus, political skill 
may contribute to perceptions of status both because it is valued by others in its own 
right and because the politically astute leader is able to discern how to facilitate the 
attainment of group goals and promote his or her instrumental social value.
</p>
<p>Effort, Sacrifice, and Loyalty
</p>
<p>Fourth, status is facilitated by indications that the person is a loyal and devoted 
group member who has the best interests of the group at heart and will occasionally 
sacrifice his or her personal interests for the benefit of the group or relationship. 
People who work especially hard for the group are accorded higher status than those 
who do not. Although a competent group member will usually have higher status 
than an incompetent one, the status of both more and less competent members will 
be augmented by indications that they are loyal and devoted members who work 
hard and are interested chiefly in the common good. For that reason, employees 
who put extra effort into their jobs are often accorded higher status (Allen and Rush 
1998; Podsakoff and MacKenzie 1997).
</p>
<p>Because perceived effort, sacrifice, and loyalty enhance status, not only do peo-
ple who seek status put a great deal of effort toward group affairs, but they also 
work to be sure that others are aware of how much time and effort they invest. For 
example, employees have been known to delay leaving work until most of their co-
workers have gone home. Trying to always appear busy with work, talking about 
working extra hours (overtime, on weekends), and volunteering to take on addi-
tional tasks increase perceived instrumental social value and status. Jones and Pitt-
man (1982) refer to such self-presentational tactics as instances of exemplification.
</p>
<p>Trappings and Signals of Social Status
</p>
<p>A final way in which people pursue status self-presentationally is by displaying 
symbols that connote status. People who have high status often possess certain 
objects that are associated with high status roles (such as larger offices, member-
ship in exclusive groups) or that are the fruits of having high social instrumental 
value (such as nicer houses, cars, and clothing), and may use those possessions as a 
means to symbolize their achievements (Richins and Dawson 1992). Because status 
is associated with such possessions, people can lead others to infer that they have 
status by displaying these status cues (Carr and Vignoles 2011; Leary 1995).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>168 M. R. Leary et al.
</p>
<p>In an analysis of tactics for increasing one&rsquo;s power in work organizations, Korda 
(1975) described how employees increase their apparent status through their choic-
es of clothing, office furniture, work-related artifacts, and workplace behaviors. 
For example, people are known to enhance their apparent importance at work by 
walking in a purposeful manner (even if they are only going to the water cooler), 
displaying multiple clocks that display the time in cities around the world (to imply 
that their work activities span the globe), always carrying a folder as they walk 
around their workplace (to show that they are on-task rather than wasting time), and 
communicating in a direct, sophisticated, confident manner (to connote authority 
and intelligence) (Fiske 2010; Korda 1975). In each case, the goal is to convey the 
impression that one has high instrumental value which, if believed by others, may 
enhance one&rsquo;s status and power within the organization.
</p>
<p>Similarly, in personal life, people can appear to be important (i.e., to have in-
strumental social value) through an array of self-presentations. In addition to the 
use of possessions that connote status as discussed earlier, people foster images of 
being important through what they say about themselves. When people talk about 
their skills, knowledge, and accomplishments, they are often trying to increase 
others&rsquo; judgments of their instrumental social value and status. Of course, people 
rarely make explicit claims that they are important, instrumentally valuable people. 
Rather, they do so off-handedly by mentioning their roles, responsibilities, compe-
tencies, and experiences in the course of ordinary conversations. People may even 
embed their instrumental value within an otherwise mundane or even deprecating 
self-disclosure, a tactic that has become known as &ldquo;humblebragging&rdquo; (&ldquo;I stupidly 
forgot to set my alarm clock and almost missed my meeting with the Governor&rdquo;) 
(Alford 2012). Likewise, when people share gossip, they are often trying to dem-
onstrate their instrumental social value by providing inside information about third 
parties (McAndrew and Milenkovic 2002).
</p>
<p>Avoiding Status
</p>
<p>Of course, most people do not go through life consistently trying to bolster their status, 
and some people may show little interest in status whatsoever. In one study, over 65 % 
of participants did not want the highest status rank in a group (Anderson et al. 2012b).
</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, having high status is associated with a variety of costs. 
Rarely is status itself problematic, but the attainment and maintenance of status 
can be accompanied by undesired outcomes. As will be discussed, efforts to at-
tain status may undermine liking and acceptance, partly because people who want 
status may focus on &ldquo;getting ahead&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;getting along.&rdquo; Moreover, norms 
may preclude high status people from forming friendships with lower status people, 
particularly within organizations or in instances in which the higher status person 
has authority over the lower status one. In such cases, high status can interfere with 
people&rsquo;s desire for social inclusion. Also, higher status often brings weightier re-
sponsibilities, more work, and thus more stress. For these and other reasons, people 
sometimes manage their impressions in ways that attenuate their status.</p>

<p>1698 The Pursuit of Status: A Self-presentational Perspective on the Quest &hellip;
</p>
<p>Situational Moderators of Tactics for Pursuing Status
</p>
<p>To be effective, all self-presentations must be tailored to the specific social context 
and the characteristics of the target individuals whose impressions one is hoping to 
influence. Public images that would achieve one&rsquo;s goals in one situation or with re-
spect to one audience may produce disastrous results when used in other situations 
or with other audiences. In this section, we explore features of situations and audi-
ences that moderate the effectiveness of self-presentational efforts to attain status.
</p>
<p>Target Preferences
</p>
<p>As we have seen, people who are motivated to pursue status must convey that they 
possess attributes that lead to desired outcomes for a group and its members. We 
have already noted that competence, the possession of material and financial re-
sources that help the group, the willingness to assist others, and displays of effort 
and loyalty are important in increasing status. Of course, the specific competencies, 
resources, assistance, and efforts that benefit a group differ greatly across groups 
and roles. Being good in hand-to-hand fighting would probably enhance the status 
of a gang member or Marine but not that of a priest or premier ballerina.
</p>
<p>Because the specific public images that promote status differ across audiences, 
people are sometimes caught in a multiple audience situation in which they interact 
simultaneously with two or more audiences that view the bases of instrumental 
social value differently (Leary and Allen 2011). Middle managers sometimes get 
caught in such situations because the instrumental behaviors that increase their sta-
tus in eyes of subordinates are different from those that increase their status in the 
eyes of their superiors. Likewise, politicians face multiple audience problems as 
they try to promote their status to groups of voters who want them to pursue dif-
ferent actions. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney&rsquo;s claim that 47 % of Americans 
do not take personal responsibility for their lives probably increased his status in 
the eyes of many of those who attended the private fund-raising event at which he 
spoke but lowered his status among many others when it was leaked to the press.
</p>
<p>Task Demands, Roles, and Norms
</p>
<p>The attributes that are associated with instrumental social value depend, in part, on 
the demands of the current situation. Those who wish to gain or retain status must 
promote their instrumental social value in different ways depending on what the 
group values at a particular time.
</p>
<p>In one study, participants who were assigned to be the leader of a laboratory 
group changed how they presented themselves to other group members depending 
on the nature of the task that the group faced (Leary et al. 1986). Leaders described 
themselves to group members as more task-oriented when they were told that a </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>170 M. R. Leary et al.
</p>
<p>task-oriented leader would be most effective (i.e., of greater instrumental value to 
the group), whereas leaders who were led to believe that a relationship-oriented 
leader would be most effective described themselves in more relationship-oriented 
terms.
</p>
<p>The role in which a person finds him- or herself also impels certain self-pre-
sentations. Most roles carry with them expectations, if not prescriptions, regarding 
the kinds of images that those who inhabit those roles must maintain (Leary 1995). 
Failure to maintain a public image that is prescribed for a role may result in loss 
of status, diminish one&rsquo;s effectiveness in the role, or compromise one&rsquo;s right to 
exercise the role altogether. Interestingly, observers may recognize that these role-
based images are not a strictly accurate or authentic representation of the person&rsquo;s 
characteristics and that the images are not necessarily an essential aspect of the role. 
Yet, people in the role must convey the appropriate image in order to maintain or 
enhance their status.
</p>
<p>For example, most people who regularly face danger in the course of their jobs&mdash;
such as police officers, fire fighters, and many members of the military&mdash;are not as 
confident and calm in the face of danger as their visage may suggest. And everyone 
realizes that, as normal human beings, people in these roles are sometimes uncertain 
and afraid. Yet, to openly display uncertainty or fear to the public would likely re-
sult in a loss of status because, from the public&rsquo;s standpoint, the instrumental social 
value of an uncertain or fearful police officer, fire fighter, or soldier is arguably 
lower than that a confident and fearless one. Thus, role demands require that people 
in such fields maintain a public image of confidence, fearlessness, and strength no 
matter how they may actually feel. Similarly, everyone knows that teachers some-
times become fed-up with their students, but a teacher who fails to maintain an 
image of imperturbability by screaming at students or complaining to parents will 
suffer a loss of status.
</p>
<p>However, people often forego certain role-based self-presentations when with 
others who also occupy the role, with no loss of status. Police officers may share 
their fears with other cops, teachers complain vociferously about students among 
themselves, and ministers are known to act up when they are alone with other mem-
bers of the clergy. Employing a dramaturgical metaphor, Goffman (1959) observed 
that a person who is &ldquo;backstage&rdquo; with others who share the role can &ldquo;drop his front, 
forego speaking his lines, and step out of character&rdquo; (p. 112). Observing the role-
inappropriate and often regressive behaviors that occur in backstage areas shows 
how much of people&rsquo;s role-based behaviors are maintained by self-presentational 
pressures to convey an image appropriate to one&rsquo;s role.
</p>
<p>Informational Constraints
</p>
<p>Norms dictate that people are who and what they claim to be, and people who mis-
represent their personal characteristics lose face and are sometimes negatively sanc-
tioned (Goffman 1959; Schlenker 1980). Thus, people are constrained in the images 
that they can present to others by what others know or might find out about them.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1718 The Pursuit of Status: A Self-presentational Perspective on the Quest &hellip;
</p>
<p>In established groups and relationships, people are often limited in the images 
that they can reasonably claim because others have information about their abili-
ties, characteristics, resources, and personal history based on both direct observa-
tion of their actions and reputational information, including gossip. Thus, people 
who desire to increase their status may have more difficulty pursuing it self-presen-
tationally&mdash;as opposed to behaving in ways that demonstrably have instrumental 
value&mdash;when others have information about them. People know this, of course. 
Research shows that people avoid presenting public images that they cannot sustain 
because other people have information that would discredit the image (Baumeister 
and Jones 1978; Schlenker 1975). For example, people avoid accepting a high sta-
tus ranking if they believe that their fellow group members will be informed about 
their ostensible poor performance on a previous activity (Anderson et al. 2012b). 
In such situations, people must demonstrate their instrumental social value directly 
through actions that benefit the group rather than simply through self-presentational 
posturing.
</p>
<p>Balancing Status and Acceptance
</p>
<p>As noted, people gain positive outcomes both by being liked (and accepted) and by 
being respected (and having status). However, in their everyday lives, people some-
times conflate acceptance and status and erroneously use tactics to seek status that 
are actually more appropriate for seeking acceptance, and vice versa. For example, 
in many instances in which people attempt to impress casual acquaintances with 
their skills, knowledge, and accomplishments, they are using self-presentations 
that are relevant to status when, in fact, they are trying to be liked and accepted. 
Similarly, people who try to increase their relational value by being successful or 
working hard may become hurt or disappointed when such efforts do not automati-
cally endear other people to them. Such actions may increase relational value (and 
acceptance) at times, but they are more relevant to status than to acceptance.
</p>
<p>Conversely, people may try to increase their status by being likeable people with 
high relational value. In work groups, for example, people may try to increase sta-
tus and respect through behaviors that are more relevant to acceptance and liking; 
such behaviors may win friends and affection without affecting status. The tension 
between status and acceptance is also seen when successful people who are widely 
respected for their accomplishments nonetheless question whether anyone actually 
likes or cares about them. Successful actors and actresses, athletes, models, musi-
cians, and other celebrities sometimes wonder whether their fame says anything 
about how people feel about them as a person. Although it is certainly rewarding to 
be admired for one&rsquo;s appearance, talent, or accomplishments, the public&rsquo;s adoration 
is often based on the person&rsquo;s instrumental social value and says nothing about his 
or her relational value.
</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s efforts to seek status are further complicated by the fact that some of 
the criteria for winning status clash with those for attaining acceptance. In an early </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>172 M. R. Leary et al.
</p>
<p>analysis of this issue, Blau (1960) suggested that an inverse relationship exists be-
tween obtaining respect versus affection from other people. Along these lines, one 
study in which people interacted in small groups over 4 weeks found that people 
who enhanced their status were less socially accepted by other group members than 
those who did not enhance their status (Anderson et al. 2006). Such effects may 
occur because certain self-presentational tactics for gaining status, such as touting 
characteristics or resources that reflect one&rsquo;s social instrumental value, may appear 
highly self-promoting (which they are), and convey that one is superior to other 
people in certain respects, generate competitiveness with other group members, or 
evoke envy. Such reactions may undermine the person&rsquo;s perceived relational value, 
along with liking and acceptance.
</p>
<p>The classic &ldquo;pratfall&rdquo; study by Aronson et al. (1966) may also be an example of 
this effect. Aronson et al. showed that a highly competent individual was liked bet-
ter if he made a mistake (spilling coffee on himself) than if he did not. The canonical 
explanation of the pratfall effect suggests that being seen as fallible makes highly 
competent people seem more human, approachable, and likeable, which is certainly 
true. Yet, this study also reflects the trade-off between acceptance and status. The 
competent person was liked less than the mediocre one unless the competent one 
performed a clumsy, humanizing behavior. Thus, competence, which presumably 
confers status, appeared to undermine liking in this instance.
</p>
<p>Thus, people who desire both status and acceptance from the same audience 
sometimes face a dilemma, and people seem to know this. In fact, the more that 
people want to be accepted, the more they underestimate their status in their own 
mind (Anderson et al. 2006). This finding again suggests that people recognize a 
trade-off between social acceptance and social status and that people&rsquo;s desire for 
acceptance and belonging can sometimes attenuate their desire for status.
</p>
<p>An early study by Jones et al. (1963) demonstrated one version of the status-
acceptance dilemma and its resolution. Pairs of low- and high-status ROTC cadets 
were instructed to exchange information about themselves. Half of the participants 
were told to convey accurate information, and half were told to try to get the other 
person to like them. When instructed to get the low-status cadet to like them, high-
status cadets became more modest in their self-presentations, particularly on unim-
portant attributes. In this way, they could appear likeable and approachable without 
undermining the positive image needed to maintain status. Low-status cadets, on 
the other hand, became more self-enhancing on unimportant attributes when they 
were trying to get the high-status cadet to like them. This tactic allowed them to 
make a positive impression without the risk of appearing self-aggrandizing or seem-
ing to seek greater status.
</p>
<p>Of course, people differ in the degree to which they value status versus accep-
tance and thus approach the status-acceptance trade-off differently. One case in 
point involves narcissism. The core features of narcissism involve a grandiose self-
image, coupled with the belief that one is entitled to special treatment by virtue of 
one&rsquo;s specialness, and research suggests that people who score high in narcissism 
are also particularly motivated to seek status (Raskin et al. 1991; Vangelisti et al. 
1990). In fact, much of the interpersonal behavior of people who are high in narcis-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1738 The Pursuit of Status: A Self-presentational Perspective on the Quest &hellip;
</p>
<p>sism seems designed to lead others to recognize their social value and importance. 
For example, they seek excessive recognition for their accomplishments, fantasize 
about fame and glory, are motivated to be dominant and powerful, have a strong 
desire to be recognized for their agentic characteristics, and are focused on status 
and power (see Campbell et al. 2006, for a review). At the same time, people high 
in narcissism appear far less concerned with relational value that is based on being 
a likeable, communal person (Campbell et al. 2002). In fact, they regularly be-
have in ways that are abrasive and off-putting, if not insensitive and offensive. The 
self-presentations of narcissists seem specifically designed to promote their status. 
And, their self-presentational efforts to achieve status are not tempered by a normal 
concern about being liked, which helps to account for why other people are often 
irritated by their interpersonal style.
</p>
<p>Whereas people high in narcissism emphasize status and deemphasize accep-
tance, people who score high in approval motivation are often caught in a status-ac-
ceptance dilemma when they wish to increase their status. Unlike the narcissist who 
single-mindedly pursues status even at the price of garnering disapproval, people 
who are high in approval motivation seek status in ways that are unlikely to jeop-
ardize the degree to which they are liked and accepted (Grams and Rogers 1990).
</p>
<p>One way in which people can achieve this balance is to demonstrate their in-
strumental social value in terms of relational and communal outcomes. People can 
contribute to collective outcomes not only through their competence and provi-
sion of material resources but also by fostering positive relationships among group 
members. Not only do people enjoy memberships in groups in which they have 
positive relationships but cohesive groups tend to perform better than noncohesive, 
conflicted ones (Anderson et al. 2006). Thus, people who foster a positive group 
climate often have instrumental social value. Because those who promote positive 
relationships are usually viewed as warm and likeable people, people who desire so-
cial approval can attain both status and approval by being relational experts within 
a group. People who prefer relationship-oriented leadership styles (Fiedler 1978) 
may fall in this category. The downside of this tactic is that contributing to col-
lective outcomes relationally may be both less valued and more difficult to detect 
than contributing directly to group performance. As a result, group members whose 
instrumental social value is based on relational behaviors may have lower status 
than those whose value is based on direct and observable contributions to group 
outcomes.
</p>
<p>Although a tension sometimes exists between efforts to seek status and accep-
tance, they sometimes work in concert. For instance, some qualities, such as social 
skill and charisma, increase perceptions of influence, innovation, credibility, re-
sponsibility for success, and effectiveness (thereby contributing to perceived instru-
mental value and status), while also increasing perceptions of trustworthiness and 
warmth, thereby enhancing relational value and acceptance (Gardner and Avolio 
1998). For example, being seen as someone who donates large amounts of money 
to charities might convey the impression of being a nice person (with an increase 
in relational value and liking) as well as being a person with resources that could 
facilitate collective outcomes (with an increase in instrumental social value and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>174 M. R. Leary et al.
</p>
<p>status). In addition, people seem to value having personal relationships with those 
who have high status, even if the high status person&rsquo;s instrumental social value is 
irrelevant to his or her personal relationships. All other things being equal, people 
seem to prefer that their friends, acquaintances, partners, and family members have 
high rather than low status in other people&rsquo;s eyes. Thus, high status can promote 
one&rsquo;s relational value even when it is irrelevant.
</p>
<p>Reactions to Having Low Acceptance Versus Low Status
</p>
<p>Because acceptance was vital to survival throughout human evolution, people ap-
pear to possess a designated system for monitoring the environment for signs of ac-
ceptance and rejection (Leary et al. 1995). This sociometer responds to indications 
of low or declining relational value by alerting people to the possibility of rejection 
and motivating behaviors that deal with the threat (for a review, see Leary 2006). 
People respond quickly and strongly to exceptionally minor indications of rejec-
tion, even when the rejection has no meaningful consequences (MacDonald and 
Leary 2005; Williams and Zadro 2005). The question arises of whether people also 
possess a comparable system for monitoring status. Although some theorists have 
proposed the existence of such a system (see Barkow 1980), much less attention has 
been devoted to how people monitor and react to status than to acceptance. Thus, 
our thoughts on this question are admittedly speculative.
</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, people are sometimes attuned to status concerns and may react 
emotionally to indications that they do not have as much status as they desire. 
Having high status is associated with greater positive affect than low status, and 
people may react strongly when they believe that others have not accorded them 
the status they deserve (Anderson et al. 2012a). However, having low status does 
not appear to evoke strong reactions across the number and variety of situations 
as does being rejected. People are rarely indifferent to being relationally deval-
ued and respond emotionally to signs of disinterest, avoidance, rejection, or os-
tracism even under conditions of zero-acquaintance and even when the rejector 
belongs to a despised outgroup (Bourgeois and Leary 2001; Gonsalkorale and 
Williams 2007; Leary et al. 1995; Snapp and Leary 2001; Williams and Zadro 
2005). People act as if they should be relationally valued and accepted by virtu-
ally everyone they meet. In contrast, people spend much of their daily lives in 
contexts in which their instrumental social value (and, thus, status) is low, but 
they do not appear to have strong reactions to most of these situations. Rather, 
people generally react to having low status primarily when they believe that they 
are not being accorded the status they deserve by virtue of their self-perceived 
instrumental value.
</p>
<p>We also speculate that acceptance can buffer the effects of low status more 
effectively than high status can buffer low acceptance. Compare two individu-
als: Person A perceives that he or she is regarded as valuable to his or her groups 
(i.e., instrumental social value and status are very high) but that no one values </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1758 The Pursuit of Status: A Self-presentational Perspective on the Quest &hellip;
</p>
<p>having a relationship with him or her on a personal level (i.e., his or her relational 
value is near zero, and he or she is chronically rejected outside of the contexts in 
which he or she has instrumental value). In contrast, Person B perceives that he 
or she is not especially valuable to the groups to which he or she belongs (i.e., 
instrumental social value and status are low) but believes that many people value 
their personal relationships with him or her a great deal (i.e., relational value 
is high). Our hunch is that Person A&mdash;the one with high status but low accep-
tance&mdash;would likely experience stronger reactions and potentially more psycho-
logical problems than Person B, who enjoys broad acceptance despite not having 
high instrumental value. Although both acceptance and status confer benefits, 
deficits in acceptance may have stronger negative consequences than comparable 
deficits in status.
</p>
<p>Conclusions
</p>
<p>People establish most of their connections with other people through one of two 
routes&mdash;by having high relational value as interaction and relationship partners, 
and by having high instrumental social value as members of dyads and groups. 
Much has been written about how people pursue relational value in order to be 
accepted by others (Baumeister and Leary 1995; Leary 2001), but far less at-
tention has been paid to how people seek instrumental social value in order to 
have status (Fiske 2010). People often accrue status in the eyes of other people 
automatically as they behave in ways that others regard as having instrumental 
value for collective concerns. However, people often make a concerted effort to 
maintain or enhance their status through an array of self-presentational tactics. 
Sometimes, status-oriented self-presentations are inaccurate or duplicitous, but 
more often, they are honest efforts to demonstrate that one possesses character-
istics or resources that are relevant to one&rsquo;s ability to contribute to collective 
outcomes.
</p>
<p>To understand more fully the ways in which people pursue status (and balance 
those efforts against their desire to be accepted), research needs to examine lay 
people&rsquo;s beliefs about the nature of their connections with other people. We get the 
sense that most people have a rather vague, if not mistaken, understanding of the 
difference between being liked and being respected, between being accepted and 
having status, and between being valued as a relational partner and being valued 
because of one&rsquo;s instrumental contributions to a collective goal. As a result, they 
do not facilitate their connections to other people as successfully as they could 
and, in fact, sometimes mismanage, if not jeopardize, important social relation-
ships. Research on people&rsquo;s reasons for wanting acceptance and status, beliefs about 
the reasons that other people like and respect them, and understanding of how to 
behave in ways that convey relevant information to other people will lead to more 
fully developed theories regarding the pursuit of status.</p>

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>Since humans have lived in small-scale societies for the majority of their existence, 
investigation of the determinants and reproductive outcomes of status acquisition in 
these societies can help elucidate the origins of status psychology. In this chapter, 
I argue that in even the most egalitarian foragers and horticulturalists, interindi-
vidual differences in physical size, production skill, generosity, or social support 
produce disparity in men&rsquo;s political influence and mating opportunity. The repro-
ductive advantages of status not only include higher fertility from privileged access 
to marriage partners and extramarital affairs but also better survival of offspring. 
These benefits to status in small-scale societies have become more apparent over 
the past several decades, as quantitative ethnography has challenged prior concep-
tions about the extent of human egalitarianism.
</p>
<p>Small-scale societies have often been caricatured to suit particular political 
philosophies. In Leviathan (1651), Thomas Hobbes described the lives of humans 
without formal government as &ldquo;nasty, brutish, and short&rdquo;. He contrasted human na-
ture with the harmonious behavior of bees and ants: &ldquo;men are continually in compe-
tition for Honour and Dignity, which these creatures are not&rdquo;. Anthropologist Lewis 
Henry Morgan countered the Hobbesian view, claiming that many hunter-gatherer 
societies are noncompetitive and nonhierarchical to the point that even spouses are 
communally shared (1877). Friedrich Engels was happy to agree, writing that hunt-
er-gatherer societies exhibit a primitive communism (1884). In the 1960s, nomad-
ic hunter-gatherers were declared the &ldquo;original, affluent society&rdquo; (Sahlins 1968), 
based in part on the egalitarianism and short working day observed by Richard Lee 
among the !Kung of the Kalahari (1968). In academia and in the public eye, the 
!Kung were heralded as a foil to the conflict, capitalism, and social injustices of the 
Vietnam War era.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>The Dobe !Kung of the 1960s certainly were one of the most egalitarian societ-
ies studied by anthropologists, but in no small-scale society do children and women 
have equal status, on average, with adult men. Formal political influence of women 
across societies is rare, due to subjugation, the sexual division of labor (including 
care of multiple dependents), and sex differences in coalition-building (Low 1992). 
By &ldquo;egalitarian&rdquo;, anthropologists generally mean equal rights and privileges among 
adult men. In his comparison of human political systems, Fried (1967) argued that 
in most small-scale societies lacking formalized hierarchy, men may be able to co-
erce women and children, but adult male status is neither differentially ascribed nor 
achieved through competition. Based on his reading of the existing ethnographies, 
Fried famously wrote of egalitarian societies: &ldquo;there are as many positions of pres-
tige in any given age-sex grade as there are persons capable of filling them.&rdquo; (p. 33). 
According to Fried and others (e.g. Knauft 1991), differences in strength, skill, or 
knowledge do not typically cause certain men in these societies to gain greater favor 
or deference from group members.
</p>
<p>Both ecological and institutional forces help maintain the egalitarianism com-
mon to many hunter-gatherer societies. In the absence of storable or predictable 
food packages, widespread resource sharing emerges to buffer risk in production 
and creates interdependence among families (Cashdan 1980; Winterhalder 1986; 
Wiessner 1996; Kaplan and Gurven 2005). In some societies, such as the Ache of 
Paraguay and Hadza of Tanzania, it was often taboo for hunters to consume portions 
of their own kills (Clastres 1972; Woodburn 1982). To express commitment to food 
sharing, individuals criticize those who brag and successful hunters deprecate their 
own achievements (Lee 1969). Humility is not optional but is normative. There are 
also checks on individuals acquiring coercive influence over others. Coalitions of 
subordinates will ostracize or, more rarely, execute individuals who display aggran-
dizing behavior (Boehm 1999). These leveling coalitions (i.e. coalitions in which all 
partners rank below the target of aggression) are sometimes observed in nonhuman 
primates (Pandit and van Schaik 2003), but in comparison with small-scale hu-
man societies they are generally risky, of small size, less effective, and short-lived 
(Boehm 1999). Additionally, communities within egalitarian societies often exhibit 
fluid membership, preventing larger kin groups from dominating other community 
residents, who can &ldquo;vote with their feet&rdquo; in the face of oppression (Knauft 1991). 
Since the major input into production in most hunter-gatherer societies is voluntary 
skilled labor rather than monopolizable material resources or land, the opportunities 
for coercion are limited (Boone 1992; Kaplan et al. 2009).
</p>
<p>However, egalitarianism does not preclude hierarchy among adult men. Boehm 
(1999) has described small-scale, egalitarian societies as &ldquo;reverse dominance hier-
archies&rdquo; where those who would be dominant have the least power relative to the 
subordinates allied against them. But this description is misleading. The ability of 
certain men to dominate others via greater physical size or coalitional support may 
be limited or suppressed, but status-leveling is better characterized as &ldquo;counter-
dominant&rdquo; behavior than an actual reversal in hierarchy (Erdal and Whiten 1994). 
Furthermore, the focus on dominance ignores prestige as an alternate route to social 
status. Status hierarchies result from both the relative power of individuals to inflict </p>

</p>
<p>costs (i.e. dominance) and to confer benefits (i.e. prestige) on other group mem-
bers (Russell 1938; Hamilton 1976; Henrich and Gil-White 2001; see Cheng and 
Tracy, Chap. 1, this volume). Group members acquiesce to higher-status individu-
als because they believe they will avoid harm and/or gain some benefit from their 
deference. For example, dominance and prestige jointly promoted increased social 
influence among North American undergraduates interacting in a lab (Cheng et al. 
2013). Humans have greater scope for prestige-based hierarchies due to their ex-
tensive sharing of food, information, and labor (Kaplan and Gurven 2005) and the 
technology and material wealth made available by cumulative cultural evolution, 
i.e., learned improvements that accumulate across generations (Boyd and Richerson 
1996; Tomasello 1999).
</p>
<p>In this chapter, I argue that status hierarchy among adult men is a human uni-
versal, found even in highly egalitarian societies with widespread food-sharing 
and status-leveling norms. I then evaluate (1) the determinants and (2) the repro-
ductive consequences of male status acquisition in relatively egalitarian, small-
scale foragers and horticulturalists. Forager and horticultural political systems 
vary tremendously, but the modal pattern of their social organization is much 
more egalitarian and devoid of material wealth inequality compared to pastoral-
ists and agriculturalists (Borgerhoff Mulder et al. 2009). Most horticulturalists are 
best described as forager-horticulturalists because they tend to supplement their 
small-scale agricultural production with hunting and gathering. A minority of for-
agers from the ethnographic record possessed intergenerationally transmitted so-
cial class distinctions among adult men (e.g. Kwakiutl of the Pacific Northwest), 
and many island horticulturalists from Oceania are similarly stratified (e.g. resi-
dents of the Trobriand Islands off New Guinea). In this chapter, I also summarize 
ecological and institutional forces that contributed to the emergence of stratified 
human societies.
</p>
<p>Status Hierarchy is a Human Universal
</p>
<p>Social status can mean different things. Status is ego-centric when it changes from 
dyad to dyad, e.g. &ldquo;father&rdquo;, and is socio-centric when it is independent of context, 
e.g., Roman Catholic &ldquo;Father&rdquo; (Service 1962). The common usage of social status 
invokes its socio-centric meaning and refers to an individual&rsquo;s relative access to 
contested resources within their social group (Weber 1922; Davis and Moore 1945; 
van den Berghe 1978). These resources include material goods, knowledge, and the 
deference or favor of peers and potential sexual partners. Social status has meaning 
only when the allotment of contested resources is somewhat stable. If individuals 
have to fight over contested resources with every social encounter, there is no sta-
tus hierarchy, only moment-to-moment winners and losers. Hierarchies represent 
agreements, maintained by deference signals, to facilitate exchange or to avoid the 
costs of repeated contest competition, as modeled by the war of attrition (Maynard 
Smith and Price 1973).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>182 C. von Rueden
</p>
<p>In small-scale societies, status hierarchy is most salient with respect to political 
influence. Service (1975) describes the self-effacing, &ldquo;first among equals&rdquo; role of 
leaders in small-scale societies, who lack coercive authority but act as arbitrators 
of conflicts and who have differential influence over their peer&rsquo;s opinions and the 
group consensus-seeking process. Of the !Kung, Shostak (1981) writes:
</p>
<p>Each group has individuals whose opinions carry more weight than those of others&mdash;because 
of age, of having ancestors who have lived in the area longer, or of personal attributes such 
as intelligence, knowledge, or charisma. These people tend to be more prominent in group 
discussions, to make their opinions known and their suggestions clear, and to articulate the 
consensus once it is determined. Despite their lack of formal authority, they function very 
much as group leaders. (p. 245)
</p>
<p>Across foragers, leadership typically emerges when multiple households must co-
ordinate foraging and camp moves. When the Yahgan of Tierra del Fuego congre-
gated to feast on whale, a leader emerged who coordinated the proceedings and 
appointed a constable to enforce order (Gusinde 1937); whaling among Inuit off the 
Alaskan coast required coordination among a crew overseen by a captain (Spencer 
1959); and Iglulik Inuit in northern Canada identified a leader who instigated camps 
moves, decided when group hunts were to be started, and who oversaw the division 
of spoils (Weyer 1932). Leadership is also potentiated by warfare: 74 % of forag-
ers in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample show informal leadership during war 
(Hooper et al. 2010).
</p>
<p>With their influence, informal leaders can occasionally steer outcomes of col-
lective action to favor themselves, their allies, or their kin. Betzig (1986) provides 
examples from small-scale societies where members of powerful coalitions differ-
entially benefit from arbitration of conflicts (e.g. Copper Inuit: Jenness 1922).
</p>
<p>The Determinants of Social Status in Small-Scale Foraging 
</p>
<p>and Horticultural Societies
</p>
<p>Social status is granted to those individuals widely perceived as best able to inflict 
costs or confer benefits on others (Henrich and Gil-White 2001). Attempts to influ-
ence these judgments of dominance or prestige often take the form of conspicuous 
consumption (Bourdieu 1984; Veblen 1899) or public displays of strength, skill, and 
generosity (Harbaugh 1998; Roberts 1998). Status acquisition strategies need not 
be consciously motivated; they calculate the expected gains in status based on such 
factors as the opportunity costs and the expected strategies of conspecifics.
</p>
<p>I subdivide status-conferring traits into embodied, material, and relational capi-
tal. Embodied capital refers to wealth that is stored as tissue in the body, such as 
muscle mass or neural tissue (Kaplan 1996). In a functional sense, embodied capi-
tal may include strength, health, personality, intelligence, and knowledge. Material 
capital refers to tangible assets external to the body, which include land, shelter, 
food, tools, etc. Relational capital refers to an individual&rsquo;s network of social part-
ners (Lin 1999) that includes mates, relatives, friends, followers, or cooperative </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1839 The Roots and Fruits of Social Status in Small-Scale Human Societies
</p>
<p>partners. Changes in status may then feedback on individuals&rsquo; wealth in these three 
types of capital (see Fig. 9.1).
</p>
<p>The traits that possess the greatest utility for imposing costs or conferring ben-
efits on others in a particular population should best correlate with social status. 
Size, strength, and skill in physical combat are components of embodied capital that 
are valued in leaders of Amazonian societies with histories of intergroup raiding, 
such as the Mekranoti (Werner 1982), the Xavante (Maybury-Lewis 1974), the Ya-
nomamo (Chagnon 1983), and the Achuar (Patton 2000). However, even in small-
scale societies lacking warfare or a warrior culture, influential individuals are often 
taller and stronger than their peers, as among the Tsimane forager-horticulturalists 
of Bolivia (von Rueden et al. 2008). Dominant individuals can facilitate collective 
action in food production or camp moves, by more easily capturing the joint atten-
tion of group members and by discouraging defection. A responsibility that often 
falls to influential individuals among the Tsimane and in other small-scale societies 
is dispute resolution (von Rueden 2011), and dominant individuals can be more 
persuasive as arbitrators. Height and muscle mass also signal health, attractiveness, 
athletic performance, and resource production, which will all increase the value of 
an individual to potential mates or coalition partners. Dominance can be difficult to 
disentangle from prestige.
</p>
<p>Hunting prowess is the archetypal male skill in foraging societies and is a ubiq-
uitous correlate with social status (Gurven and von Rueden 2006; Smith 2004; 
 Wiessner 1996). Good hunters who generously share meat signal not only their 
production skill but also their cooperative intent (Frank 1988; Gintis et al. 2001)

</p>
<p>and phenotypic quality as a mating partner (Hawkes et al. 2001a; Bird and Smith 
2005). Generous meat-sharing is likely to vary as a source of prestige, depending 
in part upon the level of group-wide sharing and the opportunity to recruit addi-
tional political allies or mates through gift giving (Patton 2005). Since the gains to 
generous meat-sharing can spur competition over who is the most generous, many 
societies implement norms to prevent conflict over the signaling of prestige via 
meat distribution. Among the !Kung, delineation of large game carcass ownership is 
usually attributed to the arrow owner irrespective of who actually killed the animal 
(Dowling 1968).
</p>
<p>Other elements of embodied capital important to status acquisition include expert 
knowledge of healing or supernatural forces. Spiritual healing among the !Kung 
is practiced by approximately half of men and a third of women (Shostak 1981) 
while in less egalitarian small-scale societies, shamans tend to monopolize healing 
power. In some Amazonian societies, the village headman is also the shaman (e.g. 
 Tapirape: Wagley 1977), while in others these roles are filled by different individu-
als (e.g. Pemon of Venezuela: Thomas 1982). Oratory skill is typically requisite for 
gaining political influence within a community, as has been noted with the !Kung 
(Lee 1969) and the Semai of Malaysia (Dentan 1979). Rhetoric is perhaps most use-
ful to aspiring leaders as a means of shaping the degree to which they are perceived 
as sharing a common identity with group members.
</p>
<p>Since material capital is relatively absent and is traditionally unimportant to pro-
duction in many small-scale societies, it is not as frequently associated with status 
as is embodied capital. For example, Mekranoti chiefs of Brazil do not differ sig-
nificantly from their peers in the number of personal ornaments and tools they own 
(Werner 1981). On the other hand, most small-scale societies are now part of a mar-
ket economy, which enables conspicuous consumption of market goods. Among 
the Tsimane, men who earn more money from wage labor and sales of horticultural 
produce devote a greater percentage of their income to the purchase of conspicu-
ous leisure items, such as watches and radios (Godoy et al. 2006). Access to novel 
material wealth is a source of status in both the Tsimane (von Rueden et al. 2008) 
and the Ache of Paraguay (Hill and Hurtado 1996). Interaction with outside politi-
cal bodies has also granted influence to individuals whose linguistic skills enable 
them to act as culture brokers, as in the Mekranoti (Werner 1981) and Tsimane (von 
Rueden et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>Influential men in small-scale societies tend to have more relational capital in the 
form of kin ties. Yanomamo men with larger intravillage kinship networks are more 
likely to gain political influence (Chagnon 1988a), and Efe men from the Congo 
form affiliative bonds with consanguineal male kin to generate allies in the face of 
competitive social situations (Bailey and Aunger 1989). Among the Martu of the 
Western Desert of Australia, men with coresident fathers achieved earlier initia-
tion into manhood (Scelza 2010). Marriage is a common strategy for constructing 
alliances. Hughes (1988) documents several ethnographic examples, including the 
Nuer of Sudan and Toba of South India, where high-status men are individuals 
on whom both affinal and consanguineal relatedness are concentrated. Among the 
Coast Salish of the Pacific Northwest, a man&rsquo;s social status was associated with his </p>

</p>
<p>intervillage alliances, established through marriage (Elmendorf 1971). In Amazo-
nian horticulturalists from Conambo, Ecuador, women occasionally broker faction-
al disputes, and men&rsquo;s social support benefit from their wives&rsquo; roles as mediators 
(Bowser and Patton 2010).
</p>
<p>Whether due to kin or non-kin, men&rsquo;s social support is paramount to status ac-
quisition. The contributions of embodied and material capital to status acquisition 
are largely due to their effects on relational capital. People seek social proximity to 
the strong, skilled, generous, and wealthy because of the knowledge and material 
goods they might acquire (Henrich and Gil-White 2001) and because of the indirect 
social value of association with powerful individuals. One of the first quantitative 
tests of the relative contributions to status of embodied, material, and relational 
capital is from the Tsimane. Status among the Tsimane was evaluated in different 
contexts, including dyadic fight outcomes, getting one&rsquo;s way in small groups, and 
influence over outcomes of community-wide meetings (von Rueden et al. 2008). 
Tsimane men who are larger and stronger are most likely to win dyadic fights, but 
influence within small groups and at the level of the community is principally due 
to social support from both kin and non-kin. Furthermore, social support mediates 
the positive effects of physical size, generosity, education, and income on influence. 
In other words, men who are strong, generous, skilled, or materially wealthy ac-
crue more political influence in large part because these attributes attract allies and 
supporters. Longitudinal data confirms the cross-sectional result: larger and more 
skilled Tsimane men gained more social support over a 4-year period, and increase 
in social support (but not increase in size or skill per se) associated with increased 
political influence over that same period (von Rueden 2011). The prominence of 
social support to status acquisition among the Tsimane accords with other ethno-
graphic reports. For example, Maybury-Lewis (1974) observes that Xavante men 
achieve higher status due to the in-group social support engendered by their athleti-
cism, oratory skill, hunting ability, sense of humor, and other attributes. According 
to Barth (1959), &ldquo;political action&hellip;is the art of manipulating&hellip;various dyadic rela-
tions so as to create effective and viable bodies of supporters, in other words, so as 
to create corporate political followings.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In most small-scale societies, older men (but not necessarily the oldest men) re-
ceive the most deference (Silverman and Maxwell 1978; Simmons 1945). Strength 
in male foragers peaks in the 20s (Walker et al. 2002), but older individuals retain 
prestige because they are more likely to be sought after for advice and they have 
more relational capital in the form of direct descendants. On the other hand, older 
males lose prestige as their production skill wanes. Hunting returns peak in the late 
30s to early 40s (Walker et al. 2002; Gurven et al. 2006). In many modernizing 
small-scale societies like the Tsimane, older individuals have had limited access 
to market-related skills, which are an increasingly important predictor of prestige. 
Maxwell and Silverman (1970) conjecture that rapid institutional change, leading 
to information obsolescence, translates into reduced prestige for the elderly. Among 
the Tsimane, community-wide influence peaks in the late 40s in more remote com-
munities but in the late 30s in communities closer to the market town of San Borja 
(von Rueden 2011).</p>

<p>The Fitness Payoffs to Social Status in Small-Scale 
</p>
<p>Societies
</p>
<p>The patterning of individuals&rsquo; investments in embodied, material, and relational 
capital over their lives is the result, in part, of naturally selected physiological and 
behavioral strategies for status acquisition. Comparison of social status and fertility 
in small-scale societies can provide insight into how natural selection may have act-
ed on status acquisition strategies in ancestral human environments. Modern small-
scale societies are instrumental in understanding human evolution not because they 
are analogues of any original human society but because they reveal how human ad-
aptations operate in the absence of modern healthcare and contraception, significant 
material wealth, and large, dense populations comprised principally of non-kin.
</p>
<p>The reproductive gains to social status may have reached their height in premod-
ern empires, kingdoms, and sultanates, where high social status included sexual 
access to a large number of women (Betzig 1986). Approximately 8 % of Asian men 
living between the Pacific Ocean and the Caspian Sea can trace their Y chromosome 
to Genghis Khan and his relatives (Zerjal et al. 2003). In small-scale societies, so-
cial status is not as clearly associated with reproductive advantages and can appear 
more costly than rewarding. Acquiring and maintaining status is demanding of time 
and resources, and not just due to generous food-sharing. For example, Yanomamo 
headmen are constantly involved in dispute resolution, which has the potential to 
drag them into others&rsquo; conflicts. They also take responsibility for patrolling the vil-
lage perimeter for raiders, putting themselves in frequent danger (Chagnon 1983).
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the relationship between status and reproductive success in small-
scale societies is often positive. One of the first quantitative investigations of the 
status-fertility relationship in a small-scale society, among the pastoralist Yomut 
Turkmen of Iran, revealed that materially wealthy men have more offspring for 
their age (Irons 1979). Subsequent studies in other small-scale societies found simi-
lar evidence of fertility gains to status-determining traits, including hunting skill 
among the Ache (Kaplan and Hill 1985a) and warriorship among the Yanomamo 
(Chagnon 1988a).
</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, Table 9.1 lists all published studies from small-
scale foragers and horticulturalists that have quantitatively investigated the relation-
ship between a measure associated with male social status (hunting ability, physical 
formidability, or political influence) and lifetime fitness (fertility, offspring mortal-
ity, or surviving offspring). The studies control for men&rsquo;s age or report completed 
reproductive histories. Across the societies represented, traits associated with male 
status correlate positively with higher lifetime fertility fourteen times out of eigh-
teen (78 %). Of the other four relationships, three produce a near significant posi-
tive relationship and one, warriorship among the Waroani (Beckerman et al. 2009), 
produces a significant negative relationship. In only four populations is offspring 
mortality evaluated as an independent contributor to total surviving offspring. Ache 
men who are better hunters, taller and heavier !Kung men, and Tsimane men with 
more influence (but not more dominant Tsimane men) produce offspring who are </p>

<p>less likely to die as children. There is suggestive evidence that the children of bet-
ter Hadza hunters and Lamelera whale harpooners are also less likely to die, based 
on their growth rates and body mass indices, respectively. In contrast, children of 
acclaimed Waorani warriors experience higher mortality. For ten results out of four-
teen (71 %), traits associated with status correlate with more surviving offspring, 
whether the result of higher fertility, lower offspring mortality, or both. Again, the 
Waorani data alone indicates an opposite effect. Beckerman et al. (2009) suggest 
that, unlike the Yanomamo, the Waorani have no cultural restriction on the timing 
of raids as revenge for previous homicides. A lack of downtime between raids, they 
argue, precludes successful warriors from translating their status into reproductive 
gains. In addition, women were more likely to be killed during raids than abducted, 
relative to the Yanomamo.
</p>
<p>While cross-cultural evidence from small-scale societies suggests that traits con-
ducive to male status acquisition often experienced positive selection throughout 
human history, the means by which high-status men achieve higher fitness remains 
under-investigated. Most of the studies listed in Table 9.1 are selective in their 
analysis of the factors responsible for increases in fertility or offspring survivor-
ship among high-status men. For example, few studies report extramarital affairs. 
Whether the fitness gains to status are concentrated within the nuclear family or 
within the context of extramarital affairs is important to debates about the evolu-
tion of human pair-bonding and male parental investment (Gurven and Hill 2009; 
Hawkes et al. 2010). Identifying the proximate pathways by which status generates 
current fitness sheds light on the kinds of social relationships evolution has moti-
vated men to maintain.
</p>
<p>Figure 9.2 illustrates the potential pathways by which status is translated into 
fitness gains. These pathways include: (1) the length of a man&rsquo;s reproductive career 
and his number of mates, (2) the age, fecundity, health, and productivity of his 
mates, (3) alliances and exchange partnerships, and (4) resources gained as a result 
of others&rsquo; deference or acquiescence. These pathways may interact in more complex 
ways than depicted. For example, the quality of a wife with respect to offspring sur-
vival may depend on the allies (including affinal kin) a man expects to gain through 
the marriage. Alliances also facilitate mate acquisition. Humans use kin and allies 
to create, manipulate, or circumvent marriage rules (Chagnon 1988b), to coercively 
acquire women from neighboring groups (Chagnon 1983), and to acquire women 
via trade or tribute (Betzig 1986).
</p>
<p>Pathways (5) and (6) in Fig. 9.2 represent alternative explanations for the status-
fitness relationship. Social status may play a minimal role in a man&rsquo;s number of 
surviving offspring if they result more from his individual productivity and inher-
ited kinship network than from his ability to procure quality mates, engender oth-
ers&rsquo; deference, or recruit cooperative partners. Furthermore, status may result from 
having more offspring, rather than the reverse, due to incentives to increase one&rsquo;s 
productivity and social support with increasing child dependency.
</p>
<p>Pathway 1 High-status men typically have greater mating opportunity, but they 
accomplish this differently across small-scale societies. While polygyny is observed 
at low frequencies in most of the societies in Table 9.1, only four studies  explicitly </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1899 The Roots and Fruits of Social Status in Small-Scale Human Societies
</p>
<p>linked polygny to status. Influential Aka and Yanomamo men are more likely to 
be polygynous while Waorani warriors and influential Mekranoti men are not. 
Acclaimed Meriam hunters have more serial wives but not so for the best hunters 
among the Hadza or the !Kung. Age at first reproduction (AFR) is more commonly 
associated with status. In four of six societies, high-status men marry wives with an 
earlier AFR, and in the two societies where they do not, the men themselves have 
an earlier AFR. Among the Tsimane, a wife&rsquo;s first pregnancy usually follows a year 
or two after marriage, so a later AFR by low-status men and their wives is due more 
to late marriages than longer waiting time to first birth.
</p>
<p>Men are motivated to pursue status because of fitness gains both within and 
outside of marital unions. Extramarital affairs are reported for three societies: the 
reservation Ache, Mekranoti, and Tsimane. Better Ache hunters, more influential 
Mekranoti men, more physically formidable Tsimane, and more influential Tsimane 
have higher intramarital offspring survivorship and more extramarital affairs. The 
reproductive measures reported for the other societies in Table 9.1 are not explicitly 
tied to within-marriage reproduction, but the fertility they report is not likely to 
be concentrated within extramarital liaisons. While women should prefer husbands 
who exhibit resource accruing power and commitment, they may place more weight 
on indicators of &lsquo;good genes&rsquo; when considering extramarital affairs. Masculinized 
traits such as muscle mass may be costly signals of genetic quality in the face of

<p>testosterone-linked immune-suppression (Folstad and Karter 1992) and other trad-
eoffs due to increased mating effort (Gangestad and Simpson 2000). Women may 
prefer dominant, physically robust men as short-term mates due to the developmen-
tal stability and &lsquo;good genes&rsquo; these traits signal. Women may not prefer dominant 
men as marital partners if dominant men are more likely to commit partner-directed 
aggression or provide unreliable paternal investment. A study of US undergradu-
ate women found they preferred prestigious men over dominant men as romantic 
partners, particularly in the context of long-term relationships (Snyder et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>Pathway 2 High-status men do not always marry higher quality wives, whether 
in terms of their fecundity (as proxied by interbirth interval) or productivity. The 
wives of high-status Tsimane and Lamelera men do not have lower interbirth inter-
vals while the wives of influential Ifalukese men do. Controlling for the numbers 
of consumers and producers within families, wives of dominant or influential Tsi-
mane men neither spend more time in food production nor produce more calo-
ries per day than other men&rsquo;s wives. These results contrast with data from the 
Hadza (Hawkes et al. 2001b), where the effects of male productivity and status 
on intramarital reproduction were mediated by wife&rsquo;s productivity. The wives of 
high-status men may not have to increase their productivity to improve offspring 
survivorship when their husbands are better providers and receive more social sup-
port from allies, both kin and non-kin. Wives might have better support networks 
themselves.
</p>
<p>Pathway 3 Greater social support in the form of trading partners and allies is a 
ubiquitous covariate with measures of social status. In Table 9.1, six of six soci-
eties demonstrate this relationship. However, investment in social support is not 
always beneficial for men&rsquo;s families, at least in the short term. Sharing decisions 
which optimize food consumption via reciprocal altruism may trade off with shar-
ing decisions which optimize alliance formation or mating display. Influential Tsi-
mane men have reputations for sharing meat more widely but they do not have more 
food-sharing partners nor do their families receive more calories per day from other 
households (von Rueden et al. 2011). Likewise among the Achuar (Patton 2005), 
Ache (Kaplan and Hill 1985b), Meriam (Smith et al. 2003), Martu (Bird and Bird 
2010), and Lamelera (Alvard and Gillespie 2004), generous food sharing or greater 
contribution to collective food production is not often reciprocated in kind. In only 
two of ten cases (from Table 9.1) are high-status men better direct providers for 
their families. Investments in social support via generosity may only pay off to men 
and their families over the long term, as a form of insurance. Generous Ache hunters 
are more likely to be provisioned when sick (Gurven et al. 2000), and better !Kung 
hunters have more hxaro exchange partners (Wiessner 2002), who are long-term 
sources of not only food but also mates and political support. The magnanimity of 
the best Martu hunters of western Australia gives them access to ritual power as 
older adults (Bird and Bird 2010). Men in one Tsimane village were interviewed 
concerning the help they received after occasional crop loss. Only five men, all in 
the top 25 % of political influence within the community, reported aid to their fami-
lies from non-kin (von Rueden 2011).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1919 The Roots and Fruits of Social Status in Small-Scale Human Societies
</p>
<p>Pathway 4 Exchange between higher- and lower-status men does not always 
involve a bidirectional flow of benefits. During disputes, physically formidable or 
politically influential Tsimane men receive more deference from their peers (von 
Rueden et al. 2011), who may be ceding resources simply to avoid the costs of 
contest competition.
</p>
<p>Pathways 5 and 6 Most studies of status and reproductive success do not test for 
confounding variables. Influential Tsimane men tend to be more productive and 
draw on a larger intravillage consanguineal kin network (pathway 5), but these vari-
ables alone do not account for their fitness gains. Better hunting ability and more 
numerous consanguineal kin increase Tsimane men&rsquo;s total surviving offspring in 
part because of their effects on political influence. Evidence from the Tsimane also 
discredits current offspring dependency as a principal motivator of status acquisi-
tion (pathway 6). The ratio of consumers to producers within men&rsquo;s households in 
2005 is not associated with change in men&rsquo;s influence over the subsequent 4 years 
(von Rueden 2011), suggesting that status begets more surviving offspring rather 
than the reverse.
</p>
<p>The Tsimane study (von Rueden et al. 2011) is the first to directly compare all the 
pathways from Fig. 9.2 to unravel the status-fitness relationship. Physically domi-
nant Tsimane men produce more surviving offspring in large part because dominant 
men are also more likely to be influential. Political influence results in more surviv-
ing offspring because it begets social support and marriage to a younger wife. The 
latter result begs the question of how women or their kin discriminate among men 
as prospective husbands. Tsimane men&rsquo;s influence does not peak until two decades 
after marriage age. It may be that young men&rsquo;s future gains in community-wide 
influence are highly predictable based on their embodied, material, and relational 
capital as adolescents. In small-scale societies, adolescence is likely a critical win-
dow for acquiring status, akin to the critical period for language acquisition in early 
childhood. Among the Aka, the cooperative partnerships forged in adolescence are 
maintained into adulthood (Hewlett and Hewlett 2013). Teenage angst in industri-
alized, large-scale societies may be the product of a psychology, shaped in small-
scale societies, that believes the social status of our middle school years determines 
our status as adults. Testing this hypothesis requires more study of adolescence in 
small-scale societies, particularly as part of longitudinal studies that assess changes 
in status and fitness across the lifespan.
</p>
<p>The Origins of Stratification
</p>
<p>A minority of hunter-gatherers from the ethnographic record are stratified by so-
cial class. Most famous are foragers from the Pacific Northwest, whose econo-
mies were based on highly productive salmon runs, whose leaders inherited their 
political titles, and who practiced warfare and slavery (Ames 2003). A number of 
ecological factors have been linked to stratification in hunter-gatherers, including </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>192 C. von Rueden
</p>
<p>resource abundance (Gould 1982), seasonal food storage (Testart 1982), seden-
tism (Kelly 1995), and population density (Johnson and Earle 1987; Keeley 1988; 
 Testart 1982). With more abundant and predictable resources, households are less 
dependent on sharing to buffer risk in food production. For example, Ache living 
on reservations have access to horticultural and store-bought goods, and they share 
food less widely compared to Ache on forest treks (Gurven et al. 2002). Less inter-
dependence across families de-emphasizes status-leveling norms. In the Kalahari, 
access to water-storing melons and domestic animals led to wealth inequality and 
increased polygyny among the //Gana !Kung (Cashdan 1980). The //Gana not only 
tolerated resource accumulation but offered respect to the wealthy rather than ridi-
cule. In contrast, the Dobe !Kung experienced much greater variation in their food 
supply and were much more egalitarian (Cashdan 1980). Egalitarianism is not to be 
viewed as a natural state, a baseline upon which layers of stratification are added 
as progressive evolutionary stages. Rather, egalitarianism is a social contract main-
tained by norms and sanctions and an ecology in which food production is risky and 
sharing necessary, even for the best hunters.
</p>
<p>The distribution of resources across the landscape, in addition to their abundance 
and predictability, is integral to the emergence of stratification. Where resources are 
heterogeneously distributed, profitable resource patches can be defended by advan-
taged individuals or kin groups (Dyson-Hudson and Smith 1978). This privatization 
of resource patches potentiates patron-client systems (Boone 1992; Smith and Choi 
2007). Clients accept their subordinate economic position due to disincentives to 
dispersal, including lower concentration of productive habitat elsewhere and so-
cial (e.g., unfriendly neighboring groups) or environmental (e.g., mountains, ocean, 
desert) circumscription (Carneiro 1970; Kennett et al. 2009). With the intergenera-
tional transmission of property, inequality ratchets up with each generation (Bowles 
2005; Borgerhoff Mulder et al. 2009).
</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, chiefs and subchiefs inherited their titles and the rights 
to salmon runs via primogeniture, and they determined when and how commoners 
conducted salmon harvests. Chiefs were also entitled to a share of their followers&rsquo; 
harvest (Boas 1921). Control of surplus food is the lifeblood of chiefly power, en-
abling them to subsidize warfare and infrastructure and to build political support 
via generosity (Clark and Blake 1994; Hayden 1995). The potlatches of the Pacific 
Northwest were grandiose, ceremonial displays of chiefs&rsquo; embodied, material, and 
relational capital, meant to shore up political support at home and endebt the neigh-
boring chiefs who were in attendance. At the potlatch, the seating arrangement, 
order of distribution of food and property, and the size or worth of gifts all reflected 
relative positions of the assembled guests (Drucker and Heizer 1967). Among the 
Gitkasan, individuals would move to new settlements after potlatches where they 
felt their leader was not as generous, hence powerful, as others (Adams 1973).
</p>
<p>Growing populations add fuel to stratification. Productive resource patches sup-
port large, dense populations, which foster technological innovation and occupa-
tional specialization (Henrich and Boyd 2008). Elites can underwrite and exploit 
new technology to expand their power. Among the Chumash of the central Cali-
fornia coast, hereditary chiefs financed the construction of seagoing tomal canoes, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1939 The Roots and Fruits of Social Status in Small-Scale Human Societies
</p>
<p>which they used to expand trade up and down the California coast. Chumash groups 
who lacked tomals also lacked hereditary chiefs (Arnold 2010).
</p>
<p>Large, dense populations also increase intragroup conflict and the difficulty of 
collective action. Group members may prefer stratification when more formal lead-
ership helps solve the problems of life in large groups and facilitates collective 
action in production, trade, defense, or aggression (Steward 1955; Service 1962; 
Hooper et al. 2010). The Paiute occupying the rich habitat of Owens Valley were 
more stratified than their neighbors, partly because their irrigation systems ben-
efited from central management (Steward 1933). To coordinate production and 
maintain social order, Plains Indian bands elected a chief and a constable when they 
coalesced for the annual buffalo hunt (Lowie 1948). Among prestate indigenous 
North Americans in general, the number of bureaucratic tiers of decision-making 
and the number of leadership functions (e.g. military, religious, judicial, productive) 
increase with a society&rsquo;s maximal community size (Feinman and Neitzel 1984). 
A nested hierarchy of offices facilitates communication and coordination in large 
groups (Johnson 1982) while reducing political dissatisfaction by maintaining the 
face-to-face leadership of more egalitarian societies (Richerson et al. 2003).
</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, high status carries greater reproductive rewards in stratified for-
agers. Throughout western North America, the privatization of resource patches 
was associated with increased levels of polygyny (Sellen and Hruschka 2004). 
Among the Chumash, polygyny was largely restricted to chiefs (Priestley 1937). 
Chiefs from the Pacific Northwest were also more likely to be polygynous due to 
bridewealth expenses, and they obtained female slaves through trade or the spoils 
of war (Barnett 1938). Australian aborigines are an exception to this pattern, with 
gerontocracies and high levels of polygyny despite egalitarianism in access to food 
resources and low population density (Hiatt 1996). More than 50 % of all marriages 
among the Tiwi were older, polygynous men marrying younger women (Hart and 
Pilling 1960). Hawkes (2000) has suggested that this &ldquo;Australian paradox&rdquo; can be 
tied to the extinction of megafauna in Australia with the arrival of modern humans, 
limiting the prestige young men can acquire as hunters. On the other hand, generous 
sharing of kangaroo or monitor lizard meat is key to acquiring ritual power among 
aborigines, such as the Martu of the Western Desert (Bird and Bird 2010).
</p>
<p>Like foragers, horticultural societies vary tremendously in political organization. 
At one end of the spectrum is the relative egalitarianism of Amazonian horticultur-
alists like the Tsimane and at the other is the ranked lineage system of hereditary 
political offices found among Polynesian chiefdoms (Kirch 1984). Land is more of 
a limiting factor in food production in Polynesia and in other Oceanic societies, pro-
moting property rights, greater wealth disparity, and conflict (Kaplan et al. 2009). 
In highland New Guinea, Big Men performed military and diplomatic leadership in 
the face of intra- and intergroup conflict (Meggitt 1977). Big Men of the Mt. Hagen 
area engaged in competitive exchanges of pigs that served a function similar to the 
potlatch of the Pacific Northwest (Strathern 1971). Even though Big Men did not 
formally inherit their positions, their offspring were more likely to become leaders 
themselves due to inheritance of their fathers&rsquo; material capital, skill, and social con-
tacts (Wiessner 2010). Where leadership was formally inherited, as in the Trobriand </p>

</p>
<p>Islands, chiefs enjoyed rights denied to other men, including the right to multiple 
wives (Weiner 1988).
</p>
<p>In pastoral small-scale societies, polygyny is common and variance in male sta-
tus and reproductive success is increased relative to most foragers and horticul-
turalists (Betzig 2012). Men&rsquo;s status depends primarily on their material capital, 
specifically the number of cattle they own. Among the Kipsigis (Borgerhoff Mulder 
1987), Mukogodo (Cronk 1991), and Gabbra (Mace 1996) of East Africa, cattle 
wealth is the biggest determinant of men&rsquo;s number of wives and lifetime reproduc-
tive success. Across human societies in general, the more that defensible material 
capital determines men&rsquo;s production, the greater the status and reproductive dispari-
ties (Kaplan et al. 2009).
</p>
<p>Conclusion
</p>
<p>Social status is a ubiquitous motivator of human behavior. From the most egalitar-
ian to the most hierarchical human society, individuals who acquire more domi-
nance or prestige receive privileged access to contested resources, including greater 
political influence and mating opportunity. In small-scale societies, status-leveling 
coalitions and household mobility restrict the opportunity for physically dominant 
individuals to coerce their way to power. Nevertheless, greater height or weight is 
sometimes a characteristic of leaders in these societies, which may be due to the 
greater efficacy with which large leaders can arbitrate disputes, coordinate collec-
tive action, or represent their peers&rsquo; interests when negotiating with outside groups. 
Probably for similar reasons, individuals in industrialized states prefer leaders who 
are taller (Ellis 1994; Murray and Schmitz 2011).
</p>
<p>Production skill and generosity are important determinants of status across small-
scale societies because they attract political allies, trading partners, and mates. At-
tractiveness as a husband and extramarital sex partner enable high status men in 
small-scale societies to produce a greater number of offspring. However, men do 
not pursue status simply to increase their number of mates. Support from allies, 
particularly during times of conflict or sickness, can be instrumental to the health of 
men and their families (von Rueden 2011; Gurven et al. 2012).
</p>
<p>The frequency with which high-status men in small-scale societies achieve 
higher lifetime fitness suggests status conferred similar reproductive advantages 
in ancestral human societies. Why then is variance maintained in traits conducive 
to status acquisition, such as physical size or prosociality, if these traits have been 
subject to such long-term selection pressure? One possibility is that the genotypes 
of high-status individuals represent a fitness peak which mutation and sexual re-
combination break down in successive generations. Among Indonesian foragers, 
horticulturalists, and agriculturalists, high fertility along patrilines rarely persists 
for more than a few generations (Lansing et al. 2008). While most heritable genetic 
variation particular to status achievement will be associated with autosomal genes 
and not the few nonrecombining genes on the Y chromosome, the more polygenic </p>

</p>
<p>the status-conferring trait the more likely mutation will check the effects of selec-
tion and maintain genetic variation. A related possibility is that status achievement 
results from conditional behavioral responses to uncorrelated genetic variation 
(Smith 2011), such as ontogenetic calibration of one&rsquo;s level of extraversion in re-
sponse to anticipated adult height and muscle mass (Lukaszewski and Roney 2011). 
Balancing selection may also operate if the fitness advantage to status-conferring 
traits differs by sex or depends on their frequency in the population. Future studies 
in small-scale societies will be instrumental in testing these theoretical possibilities.

<p>Emotions are critically important for navigating the social hierarchy. Emotions 
motivate people to seek and retain high status, and the nonverbal expressions that 
are typically displayed as part of an emotional experience communicate important 
status-related information to others. In this chapter, we examine the ways in which 
a number of distinct emotions influence status-related behaviors and outcomes.
</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, we use the terms status and rank interchangeably, to 
describe one&rsquo;s relative position on the social ladder (i.e., the social hierarchy), re-
gardless of how he or she got there. In all human societies examined thus far, there 
are individual differences in social rank, such that some individuals have greater 
opportunities for resource and mate acquisition than others, or receive greater def-
erence than others (Brown 1991; c.f. Ellis 1995). This hierarchical social structure 
results in clear benefits for those at the top of the hierarchy, but those at the bottom 
also benefit from the hierarchical system, more so than they would from abandon-
ing social living all together (see Alexander 1974; Williams 1966). As a result, dif-
ferences in social rank are a reliably occurring part of human social life.
</p>
<p>Three Ways in Which Emotions Influence Social Status
</p>
<p>Emotions facilitate individuals&rsquo; navigation of the social hierarchy in three distinct 
yet interrelated ways. First, the experience of a given emotion (i.e., how the emotion 
feels subjectively, and its associated cognitive and motivational impact) promotes 
behaviors oriented toward navigating the hierarchy. Emotions influence status-
related behaviors through both informational (i.e., affect-as-information; Schwarz 
and Clore 1983, 1988) and motivational means. According to the &ldquo;affect as infor-
mation&rdquo; hypothesis, emotional feelings function, in part, to inform individuals of 
changes in their environment, and thereby allow them to respond knowingly and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>202 C. M. Steckler and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>flexibly to significant events. At its most fundamental core, affect-as-information 
suggests that people use their perceptions of internal states (i.e., their feelings) to 
figure out what they think about the world around them. In contrast, motivational 
views suggest that emotions have direct motivational force, urging people to behave 
in certain ways regardless of what knowledge is gleaned by their feelings. Emotion 
experiences can affect status-related behaviors both by providing individuals affec-
tive information about their relative social worth, and by directly motivating them 
to behave in ways that improve their rank. For example, feeling positive emotion 
about the self (i.e., pride) can inform an individual that he or she has high social 
value, and also directly motivate him or her to behave in ways that promote the 
maintenance of this high rank (e.g., by persevering at a challenging, status-relevant 
task; Weidman et al. 2014; Williams and DeSteno 2008).
</p>
<p>Second, nonverbal displays of emotion influence social status by communicat-
ing status-relevant information, such as one&rsquo;s current rank or a shift in rank, to 
others. This can occur both through status signals, which evolved specifically for 
the purpose of status communication, and through cues, which yield status infor-
mation but evolved to serve some other function. In other words, what sets signals 
and cues apart is whether they were designed by natural selection to communicate 
some information (in the case of a signal), or were designed to serve some other 
function but information is incidentally communicated as a byproduct of that other 
function (in the case of a cue). As an example, chewing food is a reliable cue that 
one is eating, but chewing did not evolve to communicate this information, in the 
way that an infant&rsquo;s distress cry evolved as a signal to communicate the child&rsquo;s 
needs (see Smith and Harper 2003). For human emotion expressions, in most cases 
the extant empirical evidence does not warrant drawing firm conclusions regarding 
whether a particular expression that communicates status is a signal or cue, so we 
largely avoid making this distinction when discussing the relevant findings, but this 
is an important area for future research (Shariff and Tracy 2011). In general, by 
communicating status information emotion expressions may help individuals avoid 
costly disputes that can arise when rank levels of the various parties are unknown. 
Given that those who know they are lower status tend to defer to higher status oth-
ers, signaling one&rsquo;s knowledge of his or her relative status may allow both parties to 
quickly know how the social interaction should proceed. Thus, nonverbal displays 
of status likely allow for less tumultuous social interactions, compared to disagree-
ments that must be settled through aggression or other costlier means.
</p>
<p>Third, emotions influence hierarchical relationships when they are perceived in 
others who show status-related emotional displays. By recognizing distinct emo-
tion expressions in others, and automatically interpreting the meaning conveyed by 
those expressions, perceivers can adjust their behavior in an adaptive manner, by, 
for example, deferring to a high-status individual (e.g., Tiedens and Fragale 2003). 
The processes of displaying and perceiving emotion expressions are closely con-
nected, but we discuss them here as distinct (for the most part), to emphasize the 
separate benefits accrued to displayers and observers.</p>

<p>20310 The Emotional Underpinnings of Social Status
</p>
<p>Which Emotions Influence Status Attainment  
</p>
<p>and Hierarchy Negotiation?
</p>
<p>In this section, we discuss empirical findings on each distinct emotion that is par-
ticularly relevant to status, and, for each, examine how that emotion influences 
status-relevant behaviors and outcomes via its experience, nonverbal display, and 
perception in others, to the extent that each of these pathways is relevant for the 
given emotion. We focus on distinct emotions, typically defined as momentary pro-
cesses that often&mdash;though not always&mdash;include subjective feelings, physiological 
changes, cognitive appraisals, and motivated action tendencies or behaviors (see 
Roseman 2011; Tracy and Randles 2011). Many of the emotions discussed here 
are particularly relevant to the social domain, given that the most social emotions 
(i.e., emotions critically involved in the regulation of social behavior) tend to be 
particularly relevant to navigating social relationships, in general, and status-based 
relationships, in particular. These socially complex emotions include pride, shame, 
envy, contempt, and admiration. However, we also examine several other emotions 
that are linked to status in important ways, but are typically considered to be more 
&ldquo;basic,&rdquo; in that they are shared with nonhuman animals and emerge early, both on-
togenetically and phylogenetically (see Panksepp 1992). These status-relevant basic 
emotions are: happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear.
</p>
<p>Socially Complex Emotions
</p>
<p>Pride
</p>
<p>Using Experienced Pride to Navigate the Social Hierarchy Pride is experienced 
in response to socially valued successes caused by the self (Tracy and Robins 2004), 
and it is the emotion that, more than any other, likely evolved largely for the purpose 
of enhancing and maintaining social status. There is evidence linking pride to the 
attainment of high status through all three pathways: experience, display, and per-
ception (see Tracy et al. 2010, for a review).
</p>
<p>First, the pride subjective experience motivates individuals to strive for achieve-
ments in socially valued domains. Pride feelings are pleasurable and thus reinforcing; 
there is no other emotion that not only makes individuals feel good, but good about 
themselves. Through socialization, children come to experience pride in response 
to praise for socially valued achievements, and, eventually, individuals experience 
pride in response to these accomplishments without needing others&rsquo; evaluations. 
The reinforcing properties of pride motivate them to seek future achievements; so, 
without any need for external evaluations, people strive to develop an identity that 
coheres with social norms. Individuals who are successful in this pursuit are, in 
turn, rewarded with social approval, acceptance, and increased status. Supporting 
this account, studies have shown that that salespeople who respond to work  success </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>204 C. M. Steckler and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>with pride tend to work harder and perform better at their jobs (Verbeke et al. 2004), 
and that feelings of pride directly promote increased persistence, effort, and task 
performance (Williams and DeSteno 2008; Herrald and Tomaka 2002; Pekrun et al. 
2009). These outcomes likely have downstream consequences for rank attainment, 
but pride has also been shown to directly influence status-related outcomes; indi-
viduals experimentally induced to feel pride behave in a more dominant manner in 
social situations (Williams and DeSteno 2009).
</p>
<p>However, the link between pride and status is complicated by the fact that pride 
is not simply one phenomenon. Individuals reliably distinguish between the pride 
that promotes hard work and achievement motivation and is based on accomplish-
ments and confidence, and a pride that is based on arrogance and egotism, associ-
ated with self-aggrandizement and a sense of superiority (Tracy and Robins 2007a, 
2014). Given that the former form of pride, which has been labeled &ldquo;authentic 
pride&rdquo; (Tracy and Robins 2007a), is associated with achievement striving, but the 
latter form&mdash;&ldquo;hubristic pride&rdquo;&mdash;is not, these findings raise the question of whether 
both pride facets function to promote high status. Indeed, hubristic pride is linked 
to a range of antisocial behavioral tendencies and psychopathologies, such as ag-
gression, manipulativeness, and anxiety (Tracy et al. 2009). Could this antisocial 
emotion be functional in social domains?
</p>
<p>To address this question, researchers have turned to the theory that humans 
evolved to seek and attain two distinct forms of high status: Dominance, achieved 
through force, threat, and intimidation (i.e., fear-based status), and Prestige, granted 
on the basis of demonstrated knowledge, skills, and altruism (i.e., respect-based sta-
tus; Henrich and Gil-White 2001). According to this perspective, these two distinct 
forms of status are attained through divergent behavioral patterns, and were selected 
for by distinct evolutionary pressures (Cheng et al. 2013; Henrich and Gil-White 
2001; see also Cheng and Tracy, Chap. 1, this volume). Building on this account, 
we have argued that authentic pride evolved to motivate the attainment of prestige, 
whereas hubristic pride evolved to motivate the attainment of dominance (Cheng 
et al. 2010; Tracy et al. 2010).
</p>
<p>When individuals experience hubristic pride, they evaluate themselves as better 
in some way than others, and experience a subjective sense of dominance, superior-
ity, and power. Not surprisingly, hubristic pride is positively associated with nar-
cissism&mdash;a personality profile that often characterizes individuals who seek power 
at the expense of others&mdash;and has been hypothesized to be the emotion that most 
strongly drives this personality process (Tracy et al. 2009). Narcissism and hubris-
tic pride are both characterized by a lack of empathy toward others, including less 
fortunate others, which can even result in prejudice against those who are different 
(Ashton-James and Tracy 2012; Watson et al. 1984). This extreme self-focus, arro-
gance, and willingness to ignore others&rsquo; needs, associated with hubristic pride, may 
equip its experiencers with the mental preparedness to aggress against and even hurt 
others in their quest for power. It may be for this reason that researchers have found 
positive correlations between dispositional hubristic pride and hostility, aggression, 
and a tendency toward interpersonal conflict (Tracy et al. 2009). These behaviors, in 
turn, are precisely what allow dominant individuals to retain their power.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20510 The Emotional Underpinnings of Social Status
</p>
<p>In contrast, in order to retain subordinates&rsquo; respect, prestigious individuals must 
avoid succumbing to feelings of power and superiority. Competition for prestige 
would likely favor individuals who demonstrate knowledge and a willingness to 
share it but do not arrogate their authority or lash out at subordinates; aggressive in-
terpersonal behaviors would in some sense &ldquo;raise the price&rdquo; subordinates must pay 
to attain the valued knowledge (Cheng et al. 2013). Authentic pride thus may have 
evolved to facilitate the attainment of prestige by promoting a focus on one&rsquo;s ef-
fort and accomplishments (i.e., making internal, unstable, controllable attributions 
for success; Tracy and Prehn 2012; Tracy and Robins 2007a), fostering a sense of 
humility (Cheng et al. 2014), and inhibiting aggression and hostility. Studies dem-
onstrating associations between authentic pride and prosocial behavior, empathy, 
agreeableness, conscientiousness, and moral action (Ashton-James and Tracy 2012; 
Hart and Matsuba 2007; Tracy et al. 2009; Tracy and Robins 2007a; Verbeke et al. 
2004) are consistent with this account. Furthermore, recent findings suggest that 
authentic pride might promote achievement and consequent status shifts through a 
more informational means; several samples of participants were found to respond 
to low feelings of authentic pride, experienced in response to failure, by changing 
their achievement-oriented behaviors (i.e., working harder), and these behavioral 
changes had the effect of improving downstream performance outcomes (Weidman 
et al. 2014).
</p>
<p>Other findings provide more direct support for this account of authentic and 
hubristic pride as having evolved to promote distinct status-attainment strategies. 
First, individuals high in trait levels of authentic pride tend to describe themselves 
as prestigious, whereas those high in trait hubristic pride are more likely to describe 
themselves as dominant. Second, this pattern was replicated in a study examining 
hierarchical relationships among individuals on varsity-level athletic teams. Indi-
viduals who rated themselves as high in trait authentic pride were viewed by their 
teammates as prestigious but not dominant, whereas those who rated themselves 
high in trait hubristic pride were viewed as dominant but not prestigious (Cheng 
et al. 2010). That these findings emerged in peer-ratings from teammates points to 
their ecological validity; varsity teams are real-world groups where status hierar-
chies play a major role in shaping intragroup behaviors and emotions.
</p>
<p>Displaying Pride as an Indication of Status Pride also enhances status through 
its cross-culturally recognized nonverbal expression (Tracy and Robins 2008). This 
expression informs observers&mdash;typically other social group members&mdash;of the proud 
individual&rsquo;s achievement, indicating that he or she deserves higher status. Support-
ing this account, Tiedens et al. (2000) found that individuals who are believed to be 
experiencing pride are assumed by others to be high status, suggesting an intuitive 
association between perceptions of pride and status. Furthermore, both children and 
adults respond to socially valued success&mdash;an event that should boost status&mdash;by 
displaying pride, and this behavioral tendency holds across a wide range of cultures 
and among the congenitally blind, suggesting that displaying pride may be a uni-
versal human response to success (Belsky et al. 1997; Lewis et al. 1992; Tracy and 
Matsumoto 2008).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>206 C. M. Steckler and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>A series of recent studies provide direct evidence for an association between 
pride displays and status gains (Shariff and Tracy 2009; Shariff et al. 2012; Tracy 
et al. 2013). Using several measures of implicit responding, these studies show that 
the pride expression is rapidly and automatically perceived to communicate high 
status, and that pride displays are more strongly associated with high status than a 
range of other positive and negative emotion expressions&mdash;including happiness and 
anger (Shariff and Tracy 2009). Furthermore, the pride expression communicates 
high status even when the person showing the expression is otherwise known to be 
low in status&mdash;such as when displayed by a homeless person (Shariff et al. 2012). In 
fact, in this research a homeless man displaying pride was automatically perceived 
to be equally high in status as a business man displaying shame, testifying to the 
strength of these emotional displays.
</p>
<p>In addition, this finding, that pride displays send unavoidable messages of high 
status, generalizes across cultures. Individuals living in a traditional, small-scale 
society in Fiji were found to respond to the pride expression with the same high-
status inferences, despite the fact that Fijian culture strongly prohibits overt status 
signaling (Tracy et al. 2013). In other words, pride displays are automatically as-
sociated with high status in a cultural context that is entirely separated from Western 
cultural knowledge, and where it is unlikely that a socially constructed, visually 
obvious display of high status would spontaneously emerge, if it were not part of 
human nature.
</p>
<p>Perceiving Others&rsquo; Status Through the Pride Display Perceiving pride in others 
is also likely to provide status-related benefits to observers, who can more effec-
tively navigate the hierarchy by showing appropriate deference, knowing whom to 
emulate, forming productive alliances, and facilitating their own status jockeying. 
For example, pride displayers may be particularly likely to respond aggressively to 
status challenges. As a result, perceivers may benefit from recognizing and interact-
ing with such individuals cautiously, to avoid agonistic encounters. More broadly, 
the knowledge that a pride-displaying individual is high status provides a quick 
and efficient means of identifying individuals who may be worthy of admiration. 
Indeed, if the pride displayer achieved a high-status feat, perceivers may benefit 
from closely watching, and perhaps copying his or her actions. Supporting this 
account, studies have shown that individuals seeking knowledge acquisition tend 
to copy the judgments and decisions of those who display pride, more so than those 
who display other emotion expressions (Martens and Tracy 2013).
</p>
<p>Shame
</p>
<p>Using Experienced Shame to Navigate the Social Hierarchy Shame arises when 
individuals experience failure in achievement or social contexts, and attribute their 
failure to something stable about who they are (that is, to dispositional factors; 
Tangney and Tracy 2012; Tracy and Robins 2004). The experience of shame can 
lead to feelings of inferiority or a sense of being valued less than others (Tangney </p>

<p>et al. 1996; Fessler 2004; Gilbert 2003; Brown and Weiner 1984; Jagacinski and 
Nicholls 1984; Dickerson et al. 2004). Shame feelings thus may influence status 
outcomes by providing affective information to the experiencer that his or her rank 
has dropped.
</p>
<p>Although it may seem potentially maladaptive (i.e., costly) to experience 
shame&mdash;an emotion that lowers self-esteem and can promote anger, resentment, 
and even addictive behaviors (Randles and Tracy 2013; Tangney et al. 1992)&mdash;these 
costs must be weighed against the alternative: not experiencing shame in typical 
shame-eliciting situations. In other words, what might be the consequences of a def-
icit in the capacity to experience shame? Like physical pain, which is aversive but 
highly adaptive by virtue of promoting injury avoidance, shame experiences may 
be a kind of alarm system. Although chronic dispositional proneness to shame may 
be maladaptive, in certain situations momentary shame is likely to be functional, by 
warning individuals that they are about to suffer a drop in status, and thus should 
change their behavior (or run away; cf. Nesse 1991). Shame experiences may be 
a large part of what motivates transgressors to behave in accordance with social 
norms (Fessler 2007). In the same way that pride&rsquo;s pleasurable affective properties 
reinforce success, a single episode of shame&rsquo;s displeasurable properties may serve 
to prevent future failure (Barrett 1995; Ferguson and Stegge 1995).
</p>
<p>Displaying Shame as an Indication of Status Studies have shown that shame 
displays are automatically perceived as communicating low status (Shariff et al. 
2012; Shariff and Tracy 2009). Although perceptions of low status can reduce the 
displayer&rsquo;s fitness in a number of ways (e.g., Barkow 1975; Cowlishaw and Dunbar 
1991; Leary et al. 1995), nonverbal displays of shame may nonetheless provide 
certain benefits to displayers, by appeasing onlookers after a social transgression 
(Keltner and Buswell 1997; cf. Fessler 2004). Appeasement is essential to the long-
term survival of interpersonal relationships, and to the maintenance of one&rsquo;s place 
within a social group (i.e., avoiding social rejection). Keltner et al. (1997) defined 
appeasement as &ldquo;the process by which individuals placate or pacify others in situa-
tions of potential or actual conflict&rdquo; (p. 360). Specifically, when individuals violate 
social norms, they risk unpleasant reactions from others (e.g., anger, retaliation, 
ostracism), which can be dangerous (Gilbert 2007). By signaling to others their 
recognition and regret regarding unfavorable actions, transgressors&rsquo; shame displays 
can effectively minimize the severity of others&rsquo; negative responses.
</p>
<p>Appeasing others is a cost-efficient way of reducing the potential for such un-
pleasant reactions; though it may cost a rung or two on the social ladder, appease-
ment is likely to conserve more resources than leaving the social group altogether, 
or being forced to leave. In part, this is because the time and energy saved by sub-
mitting and appeasing rather than risking conflict or social exclusion can be used 
for other pursuits that can enhance fitness, such as resource and mate acquisition 
and retention (Gangestad and Simpson 2000). Furthermore, it is important to keep 
in mind that the capacity for shame evolved in a time that was considerably more 
violent than today (Pinker 2011), and where ostracism and conflict likely had seri-
ous consequences, so while it is perhaps not as critically important to appease in </p>

</p>
<p>many contemporary cultural contexts, in most of human history displaying shame 
at the right time may have provided a large survival advantage.
</p>
<p>A growing body of research is consistent with this account.1 First, behaviors 
 associated with the human shame expression have been observed in a number of 
nonhuman species during situations of submissive appeasement, suggesting that 
shame displays may have originated as submission displays shown by our nonhu-
man ancestors. Indeed, appeasement displays in nonhuman primates have received 
a good deal of research attention (e.g., de Waal 1989); these behaviors are thought 
to prevent or reduce aggression in others and help re-establish social ties. In hu-
mans, submissive postures characteristic of shame are displayed spontaneously in 
response to others&rsquo; expansive, dominant postures (Tiedens and Fragale 2003). Like-
wise, shame behaviors such as head tilted downward and slumped posture or nar-
rowed shoulders have been documented in response to failure or loss of a fight in 
human children as young as 2.5&ndash;3-years old (Belsky et al. 1997; Lewis et al. 1992; 
Stipek et al. 1992), older children aged 3&ndash;10 (Ginsburg 1980; Strayer and Strayer 
1976), high-school students (Weisfeld and Beresford 1982), and adult Olympic 
athletes from numerous countries (Tracy and Matsumoto 2008). One interesting 
finding that emerged from the last study was that although athletes were found 
to reliably display shame in response to Olympic defeat, this was the case only if 
they were from countries outside of North America and Western Europe. This cul-
tural difference&mdash;the absence of failure-based shame displays by individuals from 
the most individualistic and self-expression valuing nations&mdash;suggests that, just as 
 Fijian cultural norms may discourage the expression of pride, other cultural groups 
may impose strict &ldquo;display rules&rdquo; on the appeasing but status-lowering expression 
of shame. The finding that congenitally blind athletes across cultures&mdash;including 
several from Western nations&mdash;did reliably display shame in response to loss at the 
Paralympics, in this same research, supports this emotion-regulation interpretation, 
and suggests that shame displays may be an innate behavioral response to failure 
or social transgression, situations where an appeasing communicative signal would 
be adaptive.
</p>
<p>In sum, the shame expression may have evolved as a functional social sig-
nal, to inform onlookers of: (a) a transgressing individual&rsquo;s awareness that social 
norms have been violated and (b) his or her respect for those norms. This latter 
 communication likely increases perceptions of trustworthiness; the transgressor is 
choosing to acknowledge his or her error, rather than hide it, and thus indicating his 
or her sincere acknowledgment of, and respect for, the transgressed norm. This is 
an important message to send after a transgression, as those who break a social rule 
without communicating an admission of norm violation may be perceived as disre-
spectful of the group&rsquo;s norms, and likely to violate other norms in the future (Gilbert 
2007). Individuals who are perceived as trustworthy will, in contrast, be included in 
social groups, and will benefit from this membership by acquiring access to shared 
</p>
<p>1 Some researchers have posited a similar appeasement function for embarrassment (e.g., Keltner 
1995), but due to relatively less research attention and limited space, we do not review that work 
here.</p>

</p>
<p>social and material resources. It may be for this reason that shame displays increase 
the sexual attractiveness of both the men and women who display them, at least in 
North American cultural contexts where the low-status message sent by male shame 
displays is not as problematic for male mate value (Beall and Tracy 2014; Tracy and 
Beall 2011).
</p>
<p>Perceiving Others&rsquo; Status Through the Shame Display By perceiving shame 
displays in others, observers learn which group members are relatively lower in 
status, and can adjust their behavior accordingly, by deferring less to these individu-
als or being more assertive and demanding of them. Supporting this account, in a 
recent study we gave participants the opportunity to divide a shared resource with a 
partner who, unbeknownst to participants, was a confederate displaying a particular 
emotion expression. We found that participants allocated less of the resource to 
confederates who displayed shame compared to other expressions, yet judged these 
decisions to be equally fair (Steckler and Tracy 2014). This finding suggests that 
perceivers judge shame displayers as less deserving of a shared resource, given their 
reported sense that the fairest division was one that left them with the greater share 
than the shamed partner.
</p>
<p>More broadly, by communicating a social interactant&rsquo;s willingness to accept less, 
shame displays may be critical to the formation of adaptive social bonds. The ben-
efits of cooperation are often multiplicative, not merely the sum of the efforts of 
those involved, making this a highly adaptive social strategy for each separate indi-
vidual involved, including those who receive a smaller share (Fessler 2007; Boesch 
2005). Consequently, there may be numerous survival-related benefits to effectively 
observing shame in others, using it to infer their level of commitment to the group, 
and choosing relationship partners on this basis.
</p>
<p>Envy
</p>
<p>Using Experienced Envy to Navigate the Social Hierarchy When individuals 
view others as high in competence but low in warmth, they tend to feel envy (Fiske 
et al. 2002), a negative emotion experienced in response to another&rsquo;s higher status 
or costly possessions. Given that envy requires a comparison between the self and 
another individual, it can be quelled by bringing the envier and envied individuals&rsquo; 
relative ranks closer (Smith and Kim 2007; Hill and Buss 2008; Parrott and Smith 
1993).This can be accomplished in two ways. First, the envier can seek to attain 
items or skills associated with the envied individual&rsquo;s high status for him or herself, 
allowing the envier to &ldquo;keep up with the Joneses&rdquo; (Crusius and Mussweiler 2012; 
van de Ven et al. 2011). In this way, envy directly motivates status-seeking behav-
iors. Second, the envier can seek to reduce the status, resources, or well-being of 
the envied. This can occur through derogation (Salovey and Rodin 1984), or even 
behaviors that come at a cost to the envier, such as paying money to ensure that oth-
ers with more money lose some of theirs, or simply by being uncooperative (Parks 
et al. 2002; Zizzo and Oswald 2001). These behaviors may partly stem from the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>210 C. M. Steckler and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>envier&rsquo;s perception that the envied individual&rsquo;s advantages are unfair; Smith et al. 
(1994) showed that perceived injustice predicts feelings of hostility in response to 
an experience of envy (Smith et al. 1994). Thus, envy appears to motivate people 
to change a status quo they do not like or perceive as unjust, either by seeking to 
increase their own status or reduce the status of another.
</p>
<p>To some extent, envy is similar to shame, in that both involve feelings of inferi-
ority. However, while those who feel ashamed tend to accept defeat and engage in 
behavior withdrawal, those who experience envy are typically unwilling to accept 
their relatively lower status, and instead seek to improve it. It may be for this reason 
that people do not like to admit to feeling envy (Smith and Kim 2007); acknowl-
edgement of envy would mean acknowledgement of an unwanted status differential 
(Hill and Buss 2008). This suggests an important contrast between these two low-
status emotions: Envy drives competition and behaviors aimed at altering the exist-
ing status order, whereas shame involves the acceptance of one&rsquo;s lower status. As 
far as we are aware, there is no known nonverbal expression of envy, and so no prior 
research on the status-related effects of expressing envy or perceiving it in others.
</p>
<p>Contempt (i.e., Scorn)
</p>
<p>Using Experienced Contempt to Navigate the Social Hierarchy Contempt, also 
referred to as scorn, is an emotion that occurs in response to another&rsquo;s failure to uphold 
his or her duties to the group or to properly respect the social order by, for example, 
demonstrating disloyalty to a superior (Rozin et al. 1999). At a broader level, contempt 
is experienced when individuals perceive others as low in competence and warmth 
(classic examples of groups perceived this way are the poor and drug addicts; Fiske 
et al. 2006), or, at least, lower in competence than oneself (Hutcherson and Gross 2011; 
Matsumoto and Ekman 2004). Contempt thus may function to provide affective infor-
mation to the experiencer that the target of his or her contempt deserves lower status. 
In this way, contempt may serve an informational function opposite to that of shame.
</p>
<p>Displaying Contempt as an Indication of Status To our knowledge, prior research 
has not examined whether nonverbal displays of contempt, known to be cross-
culturally recognizable (Ekman and Friesen 1986), influence status judgments or 
status-related behaviors in either displayers or perceivers. Several researchers have 
suggested that contempt displays function to signal an intention to acquire higher 
status (Matsumoto 2008; see also Keltner and Haidt 1999), but the only empiri-
cal support for this account comes from a study testing whether head tilt upward 
influenced perceptions of dominance (Mignault and Chaudhuri 2003). Results dem-
onstrated an effect of this nonverbal behavior on dominance judgments (of the dis-
player), but this may have been due to the communication of pride, which is more 
reliably associated with head tilt up than is contempt (Tracy and Robins 2007b). To 
address this issue, future studies might examine the status implications of display-
ing a unilateral lip raise&mdash;a unique component of contempt (Ekman and Friesen 
1986)&mdash;without the addition of head tilt.</p>

<p>21110 The Emotional Underpinnings of Social Status
</p>
<p>Admiration
</p>
<p>Using Experienced Admiration to Navigate the Social Hierarchy When individ-
uals perceive others as high in competence and high in warmth, they tend to respond 
with admiration (Cuddy et al. 2008), an emotion that may motivate them to seek 
out the admired target. By increasing one&rsquo;s proximity to the admired, the admirer 
increases his or her likelihood of imitating or learning valuable skills from this 
competent group member, currying his or her favor, and, ultimately, attaining higher 
status for him or herself (Sweetman et al. 2013; Algoe and Haidt 2009;  Henrich 
and Gil-White 2001). Admiration also motivates people toward self-improvement 
in domains in which the admired target is successful (Algoe and Haidt 2009), thus 
serving as a carrot to status attainment.
</p>
<p>As far as we are aware, there is no known nonverbal expression of admiration, so 
no prior research on the status-related effects of expressing admiration or  perceiving 
it in others.
</p>
<p>Basic Emotions
</p>
<p>Happiness
</p>
<p>Using Experienced Happiness to Navigate the Social Hierarchy Several studies 
have examined the relation between experienced happiness and status, but find-
ings are mixed, perhaps in part because of the different ways in which both dimen-
sions have been conceptualized and assessed. Studies that have used socioeconomic 
status (SES) as a proxy for status have documented only a weak positive relation 
between SES and happiness (or, subjective well-being; e.g., Diener et al. 1999; see 
also Myers and Diener 1995). However, before concluding that the experience of 
happiness is only slightly relevant to the navigation of status hierarchies, we need 
to consider three other sources of evidence. First, the desire to attain happiness 
may motivate status seeking, under the assumption that increased status will lead to 
increased happiness, even if this is not entirely the case. Indeed, research suggests 
that individuals adjust to various life circumstances fairly rapidly, such that even 
very positive experiences produce a happiness that is fairly short lived ( Brickman 
et al. 1978). If this is the case, then studies that measure forecasted happiness, 
rather than experienced happiness, should find a substantial relation with forecasted 
rank increases. This view is consistent with evolutionary accounts suggesting that 
humans evolved not to experience happiness as an end point, but rather as a moti-
vational force; people seek happiness, at an ultimate level, because in doing so they 
are motivated to do things that facilitate their survival and reproduction, such as 
seeking out status-attainment opportunities (Nesse 2004; Buss 2000).
</p>
<p>Second, the weak relation between SES and happiness is belied by a stronger 
correlation between local status (i.e., sociometric status) and happiness. Given </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>212 C. M. Steckler and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>that SES captures one&rsquo;s overall status within the broader society, but not one&rsquo;s 
status within his or her local social group (as people tend to socialize with others 
who are similar to them in SES), measures of SES may fail to capture the true 
relation between social rank and subjective well-being. In fact, when status is 
measured at the level of the local group, happiness is more strongly associated 
with rank; studies show that respect and admiration within one&rsquo;s local group, but 
not socioeconomic status, predict subjective well-being, and manipulations of 
sociometric status lead to greater increases in subjective well-being (Anderson 
et al. 2012).
</p>
<p>Finally, there is evidence for a causal relation in the opposite direction; sub-
jective experiences of happiness can promote status increases. According to 
 Fredrickson&rsquo;s (2001), &ldquo;broaden and build&rdquo; theory of positive emotions, happiness 
informs individuals that they do not need to devote resources to problem solving, 
so can instead seek out opportunities to broaden and build their social worlds, in-
cluding taking advantage of opportunities for status attainment. Supporting this 
view, a longitudinal study found that subjective well-being  positively predicted 
occupational attainment years later (Roberts et al. 2003). However, experimental 
studies addressing this issue have produced more mixed findings. Several studies 
have found that induced positive affect leads individuals to become less inter-
ested in solving conflicts competitively, and more interested in collaborations 
and concession making (Baron et al. 1992; Baron 1990). This behavioral pattern, 
while consistent with the broaden-and-build social pattern, does not seem ideal 
for status attainment, but a focus on collaboration might promote the attainment 
of prestige (Henrich and Gil-White 2001). In fact, participants in this study who 
became more likely to concede also set higher performance goals, suggesting a 
link from happiness to achievement behaviors, which should ultimately promote 
status.
</p>
<p>Displaying and Perceiving Happiness as an Indication of Status Nonverbal 
displays of happiness can, in certain situations, promote perceptions of high status. 
Tracy et al. (2013) found that both North American college students and  Fijians 
living in a small-scale traditional society judged individuals who displayed hap-
piness to be high in status, though these judgments were weaker when they were 
made implicitly, suggesting that the association between status judgments and 
happy displays is not a strongly automatic one. Other studies using Western stu-
dent samples have found that happy displays are judged as indicating high domi-
nance (Knutson 1996), and that high-status individuals are expected to display 
happiness more than those low in status (Conway et al. 1999; Knutson 1996). One 
explanation for these findings, as well as the general view that happy displays 
evolved to communicate friendliness, receptivity, and lack of threat (Mehu et al. 
2007; Shariff and Tracy 2011), is that happy displays did not evolve to signal 
status-related information, but rather came to communicate high status through 
cueing&mdash;information implied by the more direct communication of positive mood 
or willingness to befriend.</p>

<p>21310 The Emotional Underpinnings of Social Status
</p>
<p>Sadness/Melancholia/Depression
</p>
<p>Using Experienced Sadness to Navigate the Social Hierarchy The experi-
ence of sadness may allow for effective navigation of the social hierarchy in at 
least two related ways that de-motivate the experiencer. First, sadness can serve 
as an intrapersonal status attainment brake. In this account, sadness and associ-
ated fatigue occur in response to unattainable goals, and provide psychological and 
 physiological encouragement to desist goal pursuit. More specifically, individuals 
may experience a sad or dejected mood when they struggle to achieve a socially 
valued goal that is beyond their reach. In such cases, sad mood is functional because 
it dissuades individuals from wasting resources by continuing to pursue the unat-
tainable. In support of this view, Keller and Nesse (2005) found that participants 
who had experienced sad mood within the past year were more likely to report 
fatigue&mdash;a possibly functional component of sadness, from this perspective&mdash;if the 
sad mood was preceded by goal failure than if it was preceded by other causes, such 
as loss of a loved one.
</p>
<p>Second, sadness may function as an interpersonal yielding strategy. In this ac-
count, sadness follows directly from a status loss and works to keep the low-status 
individual submissive (Price et al. 1994; Price and Sloman 1987). Supporting this 
view, Fournier (2009) found that adolescents who occupied low ranks in the eyes 
of their classmates tended to report higher levels of depression. Like the intrap-
ersonal brake account, this view suggests that sadness functions by virtue of be-
ing demotivating; correlates such as anhedonia may prevent low-status individuals 
from seeking out opportunities that would put them within high-status individuals&rsquo; 
radars, and also allow for the conservation of energy to best cope with the reduced 
opportunities imposed by low status. Supporting this account, McGuire and Raleigh 
(1985) found a positive association between serotonin&mdash;a neurotransmitter strongly 
negatively associated with depression in humans&mdash;and social rank in vervet mon-
keys, suggesting a possible association between sad mood and status in humans. 
Furthermore, vervet monkeys given selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 
which increase brain levels of serotonin and are used to treat depression in humans, 
became more dominant in response, suggesting a possible causal relation between 
the neurochemistry of sad mood and social rank (Raleigh et al. 1991). Likewise, 
humans taking serotonin agonists (which increase brain levels of serotonin) have re-
peatedly shown decreases in quarrelsomeness and increases in affiliation, coopera-
tion, and status (Moskowitz et al. 2001; Tse and Bond 2002; Knutson et al. 1998).
</p>
<p>Displaying Sadness as an Indication of Status Sadness displays are shown fol-
lowing the potential for loss in status-relevant domains (Tiedens 2001) and domains 
less closely linked to status, such as the loss of a loved one (Gross et al. 1994). Indi-
viduals who display sadness are perceived as low in dominance (Knutson 1996), 
and individuals known to be low status are expected to display sadness in negative 
situations (Tiedens et al. 2000). However, it is unclear whether sadness displays are 
signals of status loss or cue low status for culture-specific reasons, such as gender 
norms about the appropriateness of certain displays. For example, one study found </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>214 C. M. Steckler and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>that male displays of negative emotions (including sadness) led to reduced status for 
the displayers; according to the study&rsquo;s authors, this finding was due to the norma-
tive belief that men should not display sadness (Anderson et al. 2001). However, 
others argue that sadness displays in fact signal low threat (see Gilbert 2006, for a 
review), in which case the low-status judgments of sad men may result from some-
thing intrinsic to the expression, relevant to its evolved function. Given that shame 
displays are more likely to be low-status signals (see above; also see Martens et al. 
2012), it seems more probable that any status information communicated by sad-
ness results from other messages more inherent to the emotion.
</p>
<p>Perceiving Others&rsquo; Status Through Their Sadness Displays It is not entirely 
clear how observers use the status-related information garnered from others&rsquo; sad-
ness displays, but one possibility is that they acquire the knowledge that these 
 individuals need not be considered serious status competitors, at least while they are 
displaying (and thus presumably experiencing) sadness. Depending on the observ-
er&rsquo;s relationship with the displayer, the display may also indicate an opportunity 
to help the individual, and thereby strengthen the interpersonal relationship. This 
could have downstream status-relevant consequences, such as allowing individuals 
to forge alliances that benefit future status conquests. Alternatively, the message 
that the displayer is in a weakened or needy position may allow opportunistic per-
ceivers to aggressively take advantage of the displayer&rsquo;s current low status.
</p>
<p>Anger
</p>
<p>Using Experienced Anger to Navigate the Social Hierarchy Lazarus (1991) saw 
&ldquo;[t]he basic motive to preserve or enhance self-esteem against assault&rdquo; (p. 222) as 
a crucial component leading to the experience of anger. Others view anger as a 
response to a violation of justice or fairness (Rozin et al. 1999). Drawing on both 
these accounts, anger may function, in part, to inform individuals that their current 
social ranking is unjust and should be changed or fought (see Tyler 1994).
</p>
<p>Unfair treatment&mdash;for example, being given a disproportionally small amount 
of a shared resource&mdash;can be a sign that one is being subordinated. By feeling an-
ger in response, individuals become motivated to punish the individual subjecting 
them to unfairness, or otherwise indicate that they do not accept the suggested sta-
tus quo. This effect has been observed in experiments using the Ultimatum Game, 
where a Proposer must divide a shared pool of money with a Responder, but the 
Responder must accept the offer in order for either participant to acquire any mon-
ey. Responders who are offered low amounts report feeling anger, and respond by 
rejecting these unfair offers, even though this means punishing themselves (as well 
as the Proposer) by forgoing money they would otherwise receive (Sanfey et al. 
2003; Pillutla and Murnighan 1996). Although this may seem like a maladaptive 
response, this tactic can ultimately deter being taken advantage of or subordinated 
in future exchanges (e.g., Yamagishi et al. 2012; but see Henrich et al. 2001 for 
cross-cultural variation in Ultimatum Game rejection behavior). This view of anger </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21510 The Emotional Underpinnings of Social Status
</p>
<p>and status can be understood from the &lsquo;recalibration theory of anger&rsquo; (Sell 2011). 
From this perspective, anger functions to resolve conflicts of interest to the benefit 
of the experiencer by motivating behaviors, such as aggression, that cause others to 
&lsquo;recalibrate&rsquo; and treat the angry individual better (e.g., giving into the angry indi-
vidual&rsquo;s demands). Critically, those in a better position to inflict costs or withhold 
benefits should be more prone to using this strategy for their benefit. Supporting 
this  account, Sell and colleagues found that physically stronger men (who are more 
capable of inflicting harm when angry) are more likely to experience anger, and 
report greater success at resolving social conflicts in their favor (Sell et al. 2009).
</p>
<p>Displaying and Perceiving Anger as an Indication of Status Nonverbal displays 
of anger have been found to communicate high status (Tiedens 2001). Specifically, 
individuals who display anger are perceived as more deserving of status than those 
who display certain other emotions, such as sadness; however, anger displays are 
not as strongly associated with high status as are pride displays (Shariff and Tracy 
2009). Similarly, verbal displays of anger can be an effective negotiation tactic 
(Sinaceur and Tiedens 2006). Communicating one&rsquo;s anger to others, verbally or 
nonverbally, may influence status for several reasons. Tiedens (2001) found that 
status conferral was mediated by perceptions of competence, suggesting that anger 
displays influence judgments of status-relevant traits. In addition, Sinaceur and 
Tiedens (2006) found that, in the context of a negotiation, anger displayers were 
perceived as tougher and thus less likely to budge. However, there is some evidence 
that the lowered brow component of the anger expression conveys dominance in 
Western cultures but not in several non-Western populations (Keating et al. 1977, 
1981). If this is the case, anger may be particularly relevant to status perceptions in 
the Western part of the world, where perceivers judge anger displayers as high in 
status and competence (Tiedens 2001). These judgments likely benefit both display-
ers and perceivers, the latter of whom quickly learn which interaction partners are 
likely to engage in costly conflicts to assert or maintain their status.
</p>
<p>Disgust
</p>
<p>Using Experienced Disgust to Navigate the Social Hierarchy Disgust likely 
</p>
<p>originated to dissuade individuals from ingesting poisonous or noxious substances, 
but later became co-opted as an emotional response to social events that are per-
ceived to be metaphorically nauseating (Chapman et al. 2009; Rozin and Fallon 
1987). Supporting this account, Chapman et al. (2009) found that facial muscles 
associated with disgust were activated in response to the taste of bitterness, pictures 
of feces, and unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game. Disgust thus may function simi-
larly to anger in the domain of status hierarchies, by dissuading individuals from 
assenting to a suggested status quo or providing information that tracks unfairness.
</p>
<p>Disgust is also similar to contempt, in that it is experienced toward individu-
als who are low in competence and warmth (Fiske et al. 2006), and can motivate 
avoidance of those individuals, who are typically low on the social ladder (e.g., the </p>
<p/>

<p>216 C. M. Steckler and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p>homeless). From a strategic vantage, there is little to gain from interacting with 
individuals at the very bottom of the hierarchy, so disgust may allow individuals to 
save social resources needed for more valuable status-relevant interactions.
</p>
<p>Displaying and Perceiving Disgust as an Indication of Status Given that dis-
gust is experienced toward those who are perceived to be lower in status, it is not 
surprising that those who display disgust are perceived as high in status (Knutson 
1996). Like anger, though, disgust displays are not as strongly associated with high 
status as are pride displays (Shariff and Tracy 2009). Like happy displays, any sta-
tus-relevant communication function of disgust likely occurs as a result of cueing 
rather than signaling&mdash;disgust displays presumably evolved to communicate other 
pertinent social information (typically about the target of the disgust), and may be 
perceived to indicate the displayer&rsquo;s relatively higher status as a byproduct of that 
other information.
</p>
<p>Fear and Anxiety
</p>
<p>Using Experienced Fear and Anxiety to Navigate the Social Hierarchy Fear 
and anxiety are considered together here as they likely play similar roles in status 
navigation, given that fear is typically considered a more intense or shorter-lived 
version of anxiety (but, see Perkins et al. 2012). The experience of fear or anxiety 
may promote monitoring of social situations in which the threat of a status loss or 
social exclusion is possible (Marks and Nesse 1994). In support of this view, lower-
rank individuals tend, on average, to be more fearful (Plutchik and Landau 1973). 
The experience of fear may function to prevent these individuals from transgress-
ing in social situations where mistakes would be costly. Low-status individuals are 
relatively devalued by other group members, so their social transgressions are likely 
to be more costly&mdash;as they are more likely to result in expulsion. By chronically 
experiencing fear, or being more prone to experience fear in complicated social situ-
ations, individuals low in status may be particularly motivated to behave cautiously 
in situations that could result in punishment.
</p>
<p>Displaying and Perceiving Fear/Anxiety as an Indication of Status Displaying 
</p>
<p>fear as a signal of one&rsquo;s relatively lower status is common among some nonhuman 
animals (e.g., Bauman et al. 2006). Fear displays may also serve this communica-
tive function in humans, at least in social hierarchies based on dominance, where 
there is a frequent threat of violence and intimidation by high-status individuals. 
Indeed, a validated measure of perceived dominance includes items such as, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 
afraid of him/her&rdquo; (Cheng et al. 2010). By displaying fear in the presence of domi-
nant group members, individuals may effectively communicate their relatively 
lower dominance, and willingness to defer (Knutson 1996). As is the case for other 
nonverbal displays of low status, these cues can spare both parties from potentially 
costly conflicts.</p>

<p>21710 The Emotional Underpinnings of Social Status
</p>
<p>Limitations of the Reviewed Research and Remaining 
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>Are the Status-Related Functions of Emotions Universal?
</p>
<p>Many of the studies reviewed here were based on samples typical of psychological 
research: undergraduate students from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and 
Democratic (WEIRD) societies (Henrich et al. 2010). As a result, in many cases we 
cannot know whether the link between these emotions and status generalizes across 
cultures, as would be expected of an evolved process. Future cross-cultural studies 
are needed to address this issue, and to provide insights into how cultural and learn-
ing processes influence associations between emotions and status.
</p>
<p>It is important to note, in this context, that evidence of cross-cultural variation is 
not necessarily evidence of an absence of universality, though it can be suggestive. 
Culture builds upon and modifies naturally selected tendencies, and can thus mask 
an underlying universal behavior or association (see Tooby and Cosmides 1990). 
For example, Tracy and Matsumoto (2008) found that sighted North Americans 
tend not to display shame after losing a judo match, yet congenitally blind ath-
letes, who have never seen a shame expression, tend to do so, suggesting that the 
shame response to failure is unlikely to be learned (at least not through processes 
of visual modeling). Together, these two findings point to the conclusion that North 
Americans suppress the display or experience of shame, at least in the highly public 
situation of loss at the Olympic Games. It would be incorrect to infer from these 
results that North Americans do not experience shame in response to failure (par-
ticularly given evidence that young children in North America do display shame in 
such situations; Lewis et al. 1992). For this reason, an ideal approach is to combine 
cross-cultural methods with other approaches, such as studying populations who 
are unlikely to have learned the association of interest or cultural rules about this 
relation, such as infants. Studies using this approach have, in fact, demonstrated 
that very young infants can mentally represent and &ldquo;understand&rdquo; social dominance, 
suggesting early origins of the perception of status-related concepts (Mascaro and 
Csibra 2013; Thomsen et al. 2011), and opening the door for future research exam-
ining the origins of the associations between emotions and status.
</p>
<p>Status and Emotion Among Nonstrangers and with Repeated 
</p>
<p>Interactions
</p>
<p>Another limitation of much of the research examining the impact of emotion dis-
plays on status perceptions is a tendency to rely on unknown emotion displayers 
(i.e., photos of unfamiliar targets; e.g., Shariff and Tracy 2009). Most real-world 
status-relevant interactions occur between coworkers, friends, family members, 
or acquaintances, raising questions about the extent to which the prior findings </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>218 C. M. Steckler and J. L. Tracy
</p>
<p> generalize to the real world. In real-world relationships, individuals typically have 
a pre-existing sense of each other&rsquo;s relative rank, independent of the information 
conveyed by an emotion display. Studies are thus needed to examine the relevance 
of emotion expressions on hierarchy in more ecologically valid contexts. Studies 
that examine the emotional underpinnings of real-world hierarchies, such as mem-
bers of a university athletic team (e.g., Cheng et al. 2010; see also Tiedens 2001) 
have taken important steps in this direction, but more work is needed, particularly 
on the impact of emotion expressions within longer-term relationships. Studies are 
also needed to examine interrelations among the three major ways in which emotion 
influences status (i.e., experience, display, perception). How, for example, does one 
person&rsquo;s display influence another&rsquo;s perception and subsequent experience?
</p>
<p>Conclusion
</p>
<p>A great deal of progress has been made in understanding the nuanced ways in which 
major facets of emotions&mdash;their experience, nonverbal display, and perception in 
others&mdash;are involved in navigating social hierarchies. Together, the reviewed re-
search suggests that a rich layer of emotions underlie an ever-changing social asym-
metry. Though these findings provide numerous insights about the importance of 
emotion for navigating the status hierarchy, much remains to be explored. We hope 
this review can serve as a foundation for future research examining these issues 
from functionalist and evolutionary perspectives.

<p>Making sound decisions is paramount to effectiveness in nearly any social arena. 
For this reason, judgment and decision making has become a prominent research 
topic in a number of disciplines, including psychology, economics, and organiza-
tional behavior. Furthermore, the relationship between one&rsquo;s placement in social 
hierarchies and decision making is particularly important. As individuals move to-
ward the top of a hierarchy, there is increasingly more to gain from wise decisions 
about how to invest one&rsquo;s time, money, and effort, as well as more to lose from poor 
choices. Additionally, the decisions made by those at the top tend to affect a wider 
array of people, which means that their choices carry more weight than those of 
less prominent members in the group. Consequently, it is important for behavioral 
researchers to more fully understand and illuminate how one&rsquo;s placement in a social 
hierarchy shapes judgment and decision making. In this chapter, we aim to further 
this goal by examining the following question: When and why does having a posi-
tion of elevated power and status relative to others facilitate versus hinder effective 
decision making?
</p>
<p>Recent findings in the power and status literature provide some insight into the 
relationship between hierarchical positioning and decision making. Before exam-
ining existing findings, however, it is necessary to first acknowledge a key point: 
although related, power and status are distinct constructs (Blader and Chen 2012; 
Fast et al. 2012a; Fragale et al. 2011; Magee and Galinsky 2008). Power is typically 
defined as the possession of disproportionate control over valued resources whereas 
status refers to the respect and admiration one has in the eyes of others (Magee and 
Galinksy 2008). Thus, it is important to acknowledge this difference as well as 
highlight when power and status are likely to produce similar effects and when they 
are likely to diverge.
</p>
<p>Although power and status are distinct, it is also the case that they are often posi-
tively correlated and tend to be mutually reinforcing (Magee and Galinsky 2008). 
Given this, until recently, researchers have not made a distinction between power 
and status and, in many cases, often lumped the two together in their studies. This </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>228 N. J. Fast and P. D. Joshi
</p>
<p>makes it difficult to identify findings in the literature that are solely about either 
power or status. Given our interest in the consequences of hierarchy on decision 
making combined with the current state of the literature, we will review findings 
that examine the state of possessing high levels of power and/or status and high-
light the effects of this state on decision making. We do so based on the assumption 
that, in many cases, the effects of power and status will be similar. For the sake of 
simplicity, we have elected to use the term power throughout the chapter to refer to 
position at the top of the social hierarchy unless the research being described was 
specifically about status. At the conclusion of the chapter, we explicitly address the 
distinction between power and status and discuss when a set of findings is likely to 
emerge only in relation to either one or the other.
</p>
<p>Decision Making at the Top
</p>
<p>Powerful individuals&mdash;those who have access to critical resources, such as national 
leaders, CEOs, and high-ranking officials in organizations&mdash;are often thought to 
have an ability to make good decisions. However, one can easily think of occasions 
in which those at the top of social hierarchies made poor decisions. For instance, the 
financial crisis of 2008 may have been prevented if measures were taken to prevent 
the excesses on Wall Street. The US financial crisis inquiry commission reported 
that the crisis could have been avoided if regulators who had power to interfere in 
the situation had noticed and responded to the &ldquo;tide of toxic mortgages, breakdowns 
in corporate governance, and excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall 
Street&rdquo; (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission 2011). There are many additional in-
stances in which top management and CEOs of organizations have turned a blind eye 
to changing markets, growing competition, and flaws in their manufacturing pro-
cesses. For instance, Firestone, the leading tire and rubber manufacturer, underwent 
huge losses in 1978 after consumers filed lawsuits against the company for selling 
defective tires resulting in millions of dollars spent by the company in order to com-
pensate victims and recall defective tires. It was later revealed that quality control 
managers at Firestone had raised issues about the safety of the newly launched tires 
but their warnings were ignored by top management, resulting in their downfall.
</p>
<p>In short, although powerful individuals routinely make good decisions, they are 
also susceptible to influential psychological processes that can cause them to make 
bad decisions. In this chapter, we review research on power and decision making 
and discuss factors that facilitate or hinder decision making among those at the top 
of social hierarchies. In particular, we will focus on how having or lacking power 
affects decisions about how to spend one&rsquo;s time, money, and effort by exploring two 
key mechanisms: (1) subjective sense of control, and (2) prescriptive role expecta-
tions that increase the need for competence. We draw on existing findings to empha-
size benefits and costs associated with each of these two mechanisms and conclude 
the chapter with a section on implications and future directions for research, includ-
ing a discussion of the similarities and differences between power and status.</p>

<p>22911 Decision Making at the Top: Benefits and Barriers
</p>
<p>Power and the Sense of Control
</p>
<p>A review of the literature on power makes one thing very clear: Relative placement 
in the hierarchy has important consequences for cognitive and behavioral tendencies 
(for reviews see, e.g., Fiske 2010; Keltner et al. 2003; Magee and Galinsky 2008). 
Among other things, power&mdash;typically defined as the ability of an individual to con-
trol outcomes in an interdependent relationship (Keltner et al. 2003)&mdash;is associated 
with greater perceived control over one&rsquo;s environment and future outcomes (Fast 
et al. 2009). For instance, participants who were primed with power by being ran-
domly assigned to a manager role perceived heightened levels of perceived control, 
an effect that mediated optimism about future outcomes in an unrelated task (Fast 
et al. 2009; experiment 2). Furthermore, participants who were primed with power 
via a recall task, experienced an exaggerated sense of control which, in turn, medi-
ated higher scores on a self esteem measure and enhanced action orientation (Fast 
et al. 2009; experiment 3). These findings, along with others (see, e.g., Anderson and 
Berdahl 2002), indicate that power produces the subjective perception&mdash;whether  
accurate or inaccurate&mdash;that one has control over things that matter. This mecha-
nism had the potential to lead to a number of benefits as well as costs when it comes 
to decision making. We will begin by examining the former.
</p>
<p>Benefits Associated with the Elevated Sense of Control
</p>
<p>Enhanced Goal-Directed Action An enhanced sense of control over one&rsquo;s environ-
ment allows the power holder to attend more closely to rewards in the environ-
ment (Anderson and Berdahl 2002; Keltner et al. 2003) and, as a result, engage in 
more goal directed action (e.g., Guinote 2007). An elevated sense of control causes 
power-holders to experience social situations as less constraining (Galinsky et al. 
2008; Whitson et al. 2013), enabling the power holder to take action to meet goals 
and achieve desired outcomes. For instance, when primed with power, participants 
were more likely to turn off or move a disturbing fan placed in the laboratory (Galin-
sky et al. 2003) or indicate plans to vote in an upcoming national election (Fast et al. 
2009). Other work has shown that experiencing power in a negotiation situation 
leads individuals to make the first move, a tendency that results in a bargaining 
advantage (Magee et al. 2007). These findings are consistent with the approach/
inhibition theory of power, which asserts that power leads to behavioral approach 
tendencies whereas powerlessness fosters behavioral inhibition tendencies (Keltner 
et al. 2003). A mindset that fosters goal-directed action can aid decision making in a 
number of ways. First, it leads to increased goal setting and pursuit, which has been 
shown to improve performance across multiple situations (Locke and Latham 2002, 
2006). Secondly, power leads people to make judgments and decisions quickly and 
with certainty, which improves performance in situations that call for quick and 
decisive action. Finally, an increased goal orientation can focus people&rsquo;s attention </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>230 N. J. Fast and P. D. Joshi
</p>
<p>on what action or actions are necessary, leading to improved performance on par-
ticular tasks (Guinote 2007; Overbeck and Park 2001, 2006).
</p>
<p>Reduced Perceptions of Threat The elevated sense of control that comes with power 
also reduces perceptions of threat relative to those who lack power (Anderson and 
Berdahl 2002; Keltner et al. 2003; Scheepers et al. 2012). For example, Anderson 
and Berdahl (2002, Study 2) examined the effects of dispositional power on par-
ticipants&rsquo; tendency to perceive partners in a threatening manner. Participants who 
scored higher on personality dominance as well as those assigned to a high-power 
position tended to perceive their relationship with their interacting partner in a posi-
tive light (i.e., that their partner liked them and had fewer threatening emotions) 
as compared to participants scoring lower on personality dominance and those 
assigned to the lower-power position. The tendency to be free from perceived threat 
may be advantageous to those with power, as threat often clouds decision making 
and leads to sub-optimal choices (Gladstein and Reilly 1985; Staw et al. 1981). 
For example, threat tends to hinder the ability to learn from mistakes (Edmondson 
1999) and hinders executive functioning abilities (Smith et al. 2008). Supporting 
the notion that power may lead to some of these benefits, the powerful, relative to 
the powerless, have been shown to demonstrate superior executive functioning, in 
part because they are free from the need to monitor their actions vigilantly in order 
to avoid negative consequences (Smith et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>Reduced Temporal Discounting One of the barriers to effective decision making 
is a tendency to discount the future. Temporal discounting refers to the tendency 
to make decisions based on present considerations rather than considerations for 
how the decision would impact one in the future. For example, people tend to pre-
fer to take a smaller sum of money in the present rather than wait for a larger sum 
of money in the future (Frederick et al. 2002; Kirby and Marakovic 1995). This 
tendency occurs, in part, because people feel high levels of uncertainty about and 
disconnection with their future selves (e.g., Ersner-Hershfield et al. 2009; Griskevi-
cius et al. 2013). However, to the degree that power elevates a sense of control, it 
should reduce this uncertainty and, in so doing, help one feel more connected with 
one&rsquo;s future self. Recent findings support such an idea. In a series of studies, Joshi 
and Fast (2013b) found that power holders experience greater connection with their 
future selves, resulting in a greater willingness to wait for future rewards and sacri-
fice immediate rewards for long term benefits. For instance, when participants were 
primed to feel powerful, they were more willing to delay gains, opting for larger 
sums of money in the future ($ 120 in a year) in lieu of smaller sums of money in 
the present ($ 100 now). Further, in a field study, participants who experienced 
power in their workplace on a routine basis were more likely to delay immediate 
consumption and accumulated greater savings for their future. Additional findings 
by Griskevicius et al. (2013) demonstrate that high levels of socioeconomic status 
serve as a buffer against temporal discounting during times of economic hardship. 
In short, experiencing power, and thus control over one&rsquo;s outcomes, reduces the 
tendency to fall prey to temporal discounting.</p>

</p>
<p>Costs Associated with the Elevated Sense of Control
</p>
<p>Illusory Control and Risk Taking The reduced sense of situational constraints expe-
rienced by power holders may result in an illusion of control, where power hold-
ers exaggerate the extent to which they have control over the environment, being 
excessively proactive in seeking rewards, even when they are beyond their control. 
For instance, Fast et al. (2009) informed participants that they would receive a $ 5 
reward for correctly predicting the outcome of a single die and asked participants 
to indicate whether they would prefer to roll the die themselves or allow the experi-
menter to do so. Participants who were primed to feel powerful were more likely 
to choose to role a die themselves than allow the experimenter to do so. Similarly, 
participants primed to feel powerful were more likely to perceive a sense of illusory 
control over outcomes that were hard to control, such as the economy, than those 
who were not primed with power. Such illusory perception could prove damaging 
in certain decision making contexts.
</p>
<p>Indeed, research findings suggest that power holders&rsquo; tendency to overestimate 
their control results in greater risk taking propensity. For instance, participants 
primed with power reported being more willing to engage in unprotected sex (An-
derson and Galinsky 2006). Participants primed with power were also more will-
ing to reveal interests in a negotiation context because they perceived lower risks 
(Anderson and Galinsky 2006). The optimism and risk taking tendencies among the 
powerful may help explain why CEOs and top management teams frequently make 
bad decisions, such as pushing for ill advised mergers and acquisitions (Hayward 
and Hambrick 1997) or engaging in career-ending unethical behaviors that turn into 
public scandals (Thompson 2000). In sum, although an elevated sense of control is 
often adaptive, it brings with it several risks.
</p>
<p>Social Misperception As noted earlier, not only do those high in power feel more 
optimistic about situations and outcome possibilities, they also feel more positive 
about interpersonal relationships (Anderson and Berdahl 2002). More recently, 
researchers found that participants who scored high on general sense of power or 
those who were primed to feel powerful were more likely to perceive that group 
members were allied to them, a phenomenon referred to as &ldquo;the illusion of alli-
ance&rdquo; (Brion and Anderson 2013). This illusion of alliance was further associated 
with negative consequences for the power holder including losing power and social 
exclusion. In related work, Petit and Sivanathan (2012) found that experiencing 
elevated status leads people to perceive more applause and more favorable facial 
expressions in relation to their own performance. These types of perceptual tenden-
cies are psychologically appealing, yet they can lead to faulty decision making, 
especially when accurate assessment of one&rsquo;s social network is necessary.
</p>
<p>Overconfident Decision Making Power holders also tend to be overconfident about 
the accuracy of their decisions. For instance, participants primed to feel powerful 
were more confident about their responses to general knowledge questions than par-
ticipants primed with low power; even when there was no difference in the accuracy </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>232 N. J. Fast and P. D. Joshi
</p>
<p>of their responses. In addition, participants who experienced greater power in their 
workplace and whose roles were made salient were willing to bet more money on 
their responses to trivia questions, a tendency which resulted in monetary losses 
(Fast et al. 2012b). The experience of power and the associated optimism has also 
been associated with reduced perceptions of threats and losses in the environment. 
Inesi (2010) shows that participants who are primed to feel powerful are less likely 
to be loss averse, such that they place greater emphasis on obtaining gains rather 
than avoiding losses as compared to participants primed to feel powerless. For 
instance, priming participants to feel powerful resulted in reduced motivation to 
avoid losses such as poor grades (Inesi 2010, study 2). Participants primed with 
power are less motivated to avoid undesirable outcomes as compared to participants 
who are primed with low power, even though power does not influence the motiva-
tion to seek desirable outcomes.
</p>
<p>One can even think of real world examples where individuals in power such as 
the CEO of a company may turn a blind eye to threats in their environment result-
ing in losses for the organization. For instance, Kodak, the film and photographic 
equipment company, was slow to transition to digital photography, even when the 
technology involved in digital photography was invented by one of its own engi-
neering teams. In spite of adequate market research data to suggest that the film 
photography business may soon be sidelined by digital photography, the top man-
agement team at Kodak ignored the potential threat to its core business and did not 
make changes to its technology. In 2012, this once leading photographic equipment 
manufacturer filed for bankruptcy.
</p>
<p>This elevated confidence also leads the powerful to reject the advice of others 
(See et al. 2011; Tost et al. 2012). For instance, participants who were primed to feel 
powerful in experimental situations were more likely to ignore advice given by oth-
ers than participants primed with low power or those in the control condition. Ad-
ditionally, participants primed with power were less likely to modify their original 
estimations based on advice provided by others, irrespective of whether the advice 
was provided by expert or novice advice givers (Tost et al. 2012).
</p>
<p>Thus, having power may predispose the individual to overconfident and risky 
decisions, particularly when the threats and risks in the environment are not salient. 
Yet, in many real world scenarios, the power holder may be forced to attend to 
threats and risks, which low power members of a team may be particularly aware 
of. To the extent that high power members of a team are getting inputs from other 
group members, they may be less prone to make inaccurate decisions. Furthermore, 
situational factors as well as individual level characteristics of power holder may 
moderate the relationship between power and risky decision making.
</p>
<p>Power and Prescriptive Role Expectations
</p>
<p>In the previous section, we examined a mechanism&mdash;subjective sense of control&mdash;that  
has received a fair amount of attention in the literature on social hierarchy. In 
this section, we examine a mechanism that has received less attention but, in our </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23311 Decision Making at the Top: Benefits and Barriers
</p>
<p>estimation, is just as important: role expectations. The term social role refers to the 
set of expectations people have for a particular position (e.g., manager, administra-
tive assistant) or social category (e.g., gender, race) (Ashforth 2000; Biddle 1979; 
Eagly 1987). When enacting a role, people tend to experience a great deal of pres-
sure to fulfill the expectations associated with the role (Biddle 1979, 1986; Stryker 
and Statham 1985). Such expectations can be both descriptive, indicating people&rsquo;s 
beliefs about how most role holders behave, and prescriptive, indicating the behav-
iors people demand of role holders. Research and theoretical work on the psychol-
ogy of power and status has indicated that social role expectations represent an 
important mechanism that can influence the behavior of individuals at the top of the 
hierarchy (Fast and Chen 2009; Fast and Gruenfeld 2013; Fiske and Berdahl 2007; 
Joshi and Fast 2013a). We review relevant findings here and discuss the potential 
benefits and costs of role expectations for decision making.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that, in contrast to the idea that power increases pressure 
to fulfill expectations, power holders often behave in a liberated manner. For ex-
ample, researchers have found that power increases feelings of authenticity and, and 
as a result, leads to psychological well being (Kraus et al. 2011; Kifer et al. 2013). 
Related to the research summarized in the previous section on the elevated sense of 
control, power often provides freedom from situational pressures (Galinsky et al. 
2008) and fosters behaviors that stem from one&rsquo;s own internal goals and values 
(e.g., Bargh et al. 1995; Chen et al. 2001). Taken together, these findings seem to 
suggest that power liberates people from prescribed expectations. However, a grow-
ing body of research shows that having power can also focus individuals on the 
pursuit of situationally relevant goals, leading to behavior that is more consistent 
with the demands of the situation (Guinote 2008; Guinote et al. 2012; Overbeck and 
Park 2001). Thus, it appears that there are certain pressures and/or situation-based 
expectations that the powerful are more, rather than less, likely to internalize.
</p>
<p>Recent findings indicate that one set of expectations the powerful are particu-
larly likely to embrace are the expectations that are connected to their high-power 
roles (Fast and Chen 2009; Joshi and Fast 2013a). Consistent with the notion that 
people tend to feel pressure to meet the expectations associated with their social 
roles&mdash;especially when these roles have desirable attributes&mdash;Joshi and Fast found 
that infusing roles with power, while holding the actual role expectations constant, 
led to increased identification with the roles as well as behavior that was consistent 
with the role expectations. In short, to the degree that those at the top of the hierar-
chy perceive that there are expectations for their behavior, there is reason to believe 
that they will be influenced by these expectations.
</p>
<p>One nearly universal expectation associated with high-power roles is that of the 
need for competence (Fast and Chen 2009; Fast and Gruenfeld 2013). Here, com-
petence is defined as a general capacity to be effective and influential (Cuddy et al. 
2008; Fiske et al. 2002; White 1959). To illustrate, in one study, individuals at the 
top of their organizational hierarchies reported feeling a stronger need to demon-
strate that they had high levels of competence, but this effect only emerged in a 
condition where participants&rsquo; high (or low) power roles were made salient (Fast 
and Gruenfeld 2013). In other words, it is not simply the case that people with a </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>234 N. J. Fast and P. D. Joshi
</p>
<p>high need for competence seek out and gain power (an alternative account for a 
correlation between power and the need for competence)&mdash;instead, or additionally, 
having power increases the need to demonstrate that one is a good fit for one&rsquo;s role 
(i.e., has high competence). Moreover, these authors found that experiencing a lack 
of competence when in a high-power role was threatening (also see Cho and Fast 
2012; Fast and Chen 2009).
</p>
<p>In this section, we will examine the impact of the need for competence on deci-
sion making. As in the previous section, we first focus on some of the positive con-
sequences of this expectation and will then turn to some of the potential detriments.
</p>
<p>Benefits Associated with High-Power Role Expectations
</p>
<p>Increased Effort on Competence-Related Tasks One of the most important decisions 
people face is how to allocate their time and energy. As noted previously, emerging 
research suggests that individuals high in the hierarchy experience a greater need 
for competence relative to others and we suggest that this need will influence peo-
ple&rsquo;s decisions about how much time and effort to give various tasks in an adaptive 
way. One such decision is whether or not to exert effort on tasks that demonstrate 
and/or improve competence. For example, workers often face the need to influence 
others. This could include pitching a new idea at work, persuading one&rsquo;s colleagues 
about the best course of action, or encouraging others to work harder. We suggest 
that, due to the increased need to demonstrate competence, high-power individuals 
will exert greater effort on these types of persuasive tasks. This is consistent with 
early work by Kipnis (1972) which showed that managers with power were signifi-
cantly more likely than those without power to make active attempts to influence 
their subordinates.
</p>
<p>There are ways in which increased effort to demonstrate competence will bring 
benefits to actors. Not only will the extra effort cause them to be more influential in 
the moment, it will also likely increase their overall persuasion skills and influence 
over others, which adds to performance and elevates social status over time. Relat-
edly, to get better at something, one must remain motivated to persist in the face of 
difficulties. These are often the instances where people and organizations learn the 
most (Sitkin 1992). We suggest that the expectations for elevated competence leads 
individuals at the top of the hierarchy to continue to exert effort, rather than give 
up, when tasks become especially difficult, leading to improved performance and 
abilities over time.
</p>
<p>More Likely to Seek to Add Value to Group One of the ways people gain power and 
status in group settings is to add value to the group (Anderson et al. 2006; Willer 
2009). In this way, making choices with the aim of demonstrating competence can 
help one to climb to the top of a hierarchy. Following this logic, one might expect 
that those at the bottom of the hierarchy would try to add more value to the group 
as a way to gain power and status. However, we suggest just the opposite: Placing 
someone in a position of power will result in greater pressure to benefit the group, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23511 Decision Making at the Top: Benefits and Barriers
</p>
<p>leading to decisions that result in more success for the group. For example, a group 
or organizational leader may be more likely than others to allocate long hours of 
personal time toward projects as a way to experience success. Additionally, group 
leaders must often face the decision of whether to avoid distasteful organizational 
politics or embrace them as a means of bringing more resources on his or her own 
department or division. The expectation that he/she must demonstrate competence 
increases the likelihood of making decisions to engage in political behavior, lead-
ing to more power and status as a result. Consistent with these ideas, Willer (2009) 
found that providing group members with status led those individuals to become 
more committed and give more to their group members in a social dilemma.
</p>
<p>In a similar way, the need to appear competent may also influence how one 
chooses to treat others, at least to the degree that the performance of these others 
has implications for how others will view the power holder. Recent work by Fer-
guson, Ormiston, and Moon (2010), for instance, showed that participants primed 
with powerful roles were more likely to select proactive methods of training and 
confrontation when dealing with a poor performer in their team as compared to 
participants who were assigned to a low power role. Similarly, in a field study, indi-
viduals who had higher power in their organization were more likely to train a poor 
performer in order to help them improve their performance. They were also more 
likely to confront the poor performer than individuals who did not have power.
</p>
<p>Importantly, the sets of group enhancing behaviors described above lead to ben-
efits not only for the group but also the individual, who boosts individual perfor-
mance and gains additional power and status in the process.
</p>
<p>More Motivated to Learn and Grow Another way in which the prescriptive need 
for competence may beneficially influence decision making is to increase the likeli-
hood of choosing to spend one&rsquo;s time on learning and growth activities. In particu-
lar, people in positions of power may become more likely to pursue educational and 
training experiences, as doing so would help them to establish greater competence. 
Similarly, they may be more likely to adopt and pursue challenging goals, such 
as stretch goals (Sitkin et al. 2011). Goal setting research shows that when people 
pursue challenging goals, they tend to gain new skills and perform at higher levels 
(Locke and Latham 2002, 2006). In sum, it is likely that the role expectation that 
one be competent when at the top of the hierarchy leads to new knowledge and new 
skills and abilities that aid in performance and serve to provide even more power 
and status.
</p>
<p>Costs Associated with High-Power Role Expectations
</p>
<p>There are also costs associated with role expectations. In fact, many have writ-
ten about the stress and demands associated with being at the top (e.g., Mintzberg 
1973, 2009; Pfeffer 2010). The same is likely true for the expectation that one have 
a high degree of competence. One key factor that can turn expected competence 
from a positive into a negative is whether or not one feels personally capable of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>236 N. J. Fast and P. D. Joshi
</p>
<p>demonstrating such competence. As noted above, having power likely encourages 
</p>
<p>those at the top to allocate their personal resources in ways that lead to learning, 
</p>
<p>growing, and increased status in the group. However, when one feels incompetent, 
</p>
<p>unable to learn, or that the environment blocks growth, expected competence may 
</p>
<p>lead to negative consequences.
</p>
<p>Ego Threat One potential detriment associated with prescriptive competence 
</p>
<p>expectations is the tendency to experience ego threat when unable to meet the 
</p>
<p>expectations. According to self-discrepancy theory (Higgins 1987), a failure to 
</p>
<p>meet one&rsquo;s ought-related self standards is threatening and leads to anxiety. Consis-
</p>
<p>tent with these ideas, Fast and Chen (2009) found that power holders who lack self-
</p>
<p>perceived competence respond with ego defensive aggression (also see Cho and 
</p>
<p>Fast 2012). When people are blinded by ego threat they often make decisions that 
</p>
<p>are sub-optimal because they are more focused on assuaging the aversive state than 
</p>
<p>they are on making sound decisions. For example, a recent field study showed that 
</p>
<p>managers in a large multi-national company who lacked managerial self-efficacy 
</p>
<p>were less likely than others to solicit and receive helpful input from subordinates 
</p>
<p>(Fast et al. in press). This tendency to suppress voice has been associated with a 
</p>
<p>number of maladaptive consequences (Edmondson 1999; Morrison and Milliken 
</p>
<p>2000). Another possible tendency among power holders with &ldquo;something to prove&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>may involve attempts to expand their divisions or organizations so that they appear 
</p>
<p>more powerful and competent. As noted earlier, such decisions to merge with and/
</p>
<p>or acquire other companies are often maladaptive. In sum, lacking the perceived 
</p>
<p>ability to meet the competence expectations associated with high-power roles can 
</p>
<p>be threatening and, as a consequence, can hinder effective decision making.
</p>
<p>Stress and Decision Making Beyond ego threat, the need to possess and demon-
</p>
<p>strate competence on a daily basis can create feelings of stress among the power-
</p>
<p>ful, and this could lead to negative consequences. Existing research indicates that 
</p>
<p>demands associated with one&rsquo;s role, although often positive, can produce stress 
</p>
<p>(Meijman and Mulder 1998), which in turn often leads to negative consequences 
</p>
<p>for health and well being (e.g., Sheldon and Wills 1985). Particularly relevant to 
</p>
<p>the present chapter, researchers have demonstrated that stress also influences deci-
</p>
<p>sion making. For example, stress reduces deliberative thought processes and leads 
</p>
<p>to more automated decision making (Evans 2003; Kahneman and Frederick 2002; 
</p>
<p>Reyna 2004) including increased risk-taking in loss domains and increased conser-
</p>
<p>vatism in gain domains (Porcelli and Delgado 2009). Given the need for reflective 
</p>
<p>deliberation in the decision making process, this can lead to negative consequences. 
</p>
<p>Although some research has shown that powerful leaders experience lower levels of 
</p>
<p>stress than others (Sherman et al. 2012), other work has shown that the expectations 
</p>
<p>associated with high-power roles can lead to heightened levels of stress (see Mintz-
</p>
<p>berg 2009; Pfeffer 2010). Given these conflicting accounts, further research on the 
</p>
<p>effects of stress on decision making among the powerful&mdash;when are the powerful 
</p>
<p>most and least likely to experience stress, and with what effects&mdash;is warranted.
</p>
<p>Effects of Decisions on Relationships Another possible challenge associated with 
</p>
<p>increased demands and expectations is an increased difficulty in maintaining </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23711 Decision Making at the Top: Benefits and Barriers
</p>
<p>positive relationships with others. The elevated pressure to demonstrate compe-
tence through their work-related performance may lead power holders to make 
decisions that involve &ldquo;using&rdquo; other people as a means to an end. As noted, research 
suggests that the powerful have a tendency to objectify others when pursuing goals 
(Gruenfeld et al. 2008). Other work indicates that the powerful tend to view people 
through the lens of agency (Cislak 2013). These tendencies can increase efficiency 
and bottom line results in the short-term, but they can also damage relationships, 
hinder trust, and reduce morale. In this way, the tendency to objectify and use other 
people as a means to the end of improving group or organizational performance can 
lead to negative interpersonal and organizational consequences.
</p>
<p>Conclusion
</p>
<p>The experience of being at the top of the hierarchy both provides individuals with 
a sense of control over the environment as well as creates a press for meeting role 
demands. These two factors associated with power influence decision making, re-
sulting in a number of potentially positive and negative consequences. In this chap-
ter, we have highlighted how these two mechanisms&mdash;sense of control and role 
expectations&mdash;influence decision making among power holders and indicate when 
and why power holders are likely to make good or bad decisions.
</p>
<p>The experience of control as well as lower perceptions of social constraint ex-
perienced by the power holder may provide confidence to take action and pursue 
rewards in the environment. In addition, power holders are more flexible in their 
goal pursuit, being able to adapt flexibly to changing goals and reward sources. Yet, 
at the same time, they are likely to experience a sense of overconfidence and the 
tendency to ignore losses and situational constraints resulting in risky decisions and 
financial loss. Power holders may ignore threats in the environment, particularly 
when these threats are not salient, resulting in inadequate weighing of costs and 
benefits of decisions. Their tendency to ignore advice as a result of being overconfi-
dent in their own abilities may further perpetuate risky decision making.
</p>
<p>As noted, power holders also tend to identify more strongly with the power-
providing roles, leading to an increased need to meet role demands. A universal 
expectation associated with high-power roles is the need for competence, a demand 
that can have both positive and negative consequences. For example, power holders 
may seek to learn, grow, and add value to their groups in order to demonstrate com-
petence and gain status in the eyes of others. However, the press for competence 
among power holders can also induce feelings of threat and stress, especially when 
one feels unable to meet one&rsquo;s role expectations.
</p>
<p>The effects of power on decision making are moderated by situational factors, 
such as the extent to which the power hierarchy is perceived as stable as well as the 
perceived legitimacy of the power (Lammers et al. 2008). When power hierarchies 
are unstable, a factor that is likely to cause high power holders to be more sensitive 
to threats in the environment, high power individuals make less risky decisions than </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>238 N. J. Fast and P. D. Joshi
</p>
<p>low power holders (Sligte et al. 2011; Maner 2012). In addition, the personality of 
the power holder also influences the extent to which having objective power influ-
ences decision making. For instance, participants high in power motivation made 
less risky choices when given a high power role as compared to participants who 
had a low power motivation (Maner 2012). Along similar lines, participants with a 
high need for power are more likely to behave in ways consistent with role expecta-
tions associated with high power roles than participants with a low need for power 
(Joshi and Fast 2013). Thus, both individual and situational factors influence the 
effect of power on decision making.
</p>
<p>Understanding the extent to which the effects of power on decision making are 
moderated by individual level and situational variables in real world organizations 
may allow researchers to provide clearer recommendations about ways in which 
people can shield against negative effects of power. Using survey methods and field 
studies, future research may benefit from examining the decision making of indi-
viduals who have power in work settings. It is also important to examine whether 
status and power differ in the extent to which they influence decisions and whether 
status moderates the effects of power on decision making.
</p>
<p>Future research can also examine role expectations associated with high power 
roles and their influence on decision making. Competence is only one type of ex-
pectation associated with high-power roles. We chose to focus on this variable be-
cause it is perhaps the most universally held expectation for those in positions of 
privilege. However, future research should also consider how other expectations 
associated with elevated power and status that might be context and culture driven 
influence decision making. For example, if having a high-power role causes one to 
become aware of expectations that one behave ethically (such as in a well regulated 
environment or organization), it could lead to more ethical decision making. In con-
trast, if one has power in a domain in which power is associated with expectations 
that one act selfishly (such as in competitive environments or cultures characterized 
by corruption), power may lead to unethical decision making. These ideas have not 
been examined in the literature, but we think this type of question could lead to 
fruitful advances in the field.
</p>
<p>Finally, future research should also seek to make a stronger empirical distinc-
tion between power and status. We have intentionally used the term power in this 
chapter to refer to the state of holding a position that is high in the social hierarchy. 
However, it is possible to have power without status and status without power (Ma-
gee and Galinsky 2008). Furthermore, the effects of power and status often interact 
to produce unique effects (Blader and Chen 2012; Fast et al. 2012a ; Fragale et al. 
2011). The first mechanism we examined in this chapter&mdash;the sense of control&mdash;is 
likely to emerge under conditions of high status. Thus, we would expect status and 
power to lead to similar effects associated with an elevated sense of control. Simi-
larly, because of the link between competence and status, it is likely that high-status 
roles come with the need to demonstrate competence. Thus, high status roles likely 
produce some of the same positive and negative tendencies associated with the need 
for competence. Where we would expect to see some interesting effects is when 
power and status are incongruent. In particular, when power holders lack status, we </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23911 Decision Making at the Top: Benefits and Barriers
</p>
<p>would expect to see the sense of control diminished, thus eliminating the effects 
we described in the present chapter. In the case of competence, we would expect 
power holders who lack status to feel more threatened, leading to greater tenden-
cies to treat others in negative ways (e.g., Fast and Chen 2009; Fast et al. 2012a). In 
sum, future research should further investigate both the main effects as well as the 
interactive effects of power and status on decision making.

<p>Social Categories Can Create and Reflect Inequality
</p>
<p>As much as we might resist, we are often quickly reduced to categories. In inter-
personal impressions, frequently one is what one does: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an investment banker&rdquo; 
connotes something distinct from, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a construction worker.&rdquo; Sometimes there 
is utility in categorization, such as when police narrow their suspect search based 
upon a description of age, gender, and race. Nevertheless, rapid interpersonal cat-
egorization creates simplistic, unindividuating consequences, reducing us to a mere 
fraction of our intrinsic complexity, treated as interchangeable with other members 
of that cluster. And clusters differentiate by social status, which is one of the main 
reasons we resist them.
</p>
<p>This chapter emphasizes this latter, unfortunate side of social categories. After 
all, not all categories are created equal: Tall and attractive people enjoy well-docu-
mented benefits. Overweight and quiet people tend to be underappreciated. Women 
and minorities have faced historical uphill battles to equal societal benefits. How do 
we make sense of these power and status imbalances? How do macro, overarching 
forces, and individual, perceiver biases each contribute?
</p>
<p>In discussing these issues, we focus on perspectives deriving from two branches 
of social psychology: classic sociological social psychology and prevailing psy-
chological social psychology. Both fields delineate how inequalities result from 
deindividuating people into broad social categories. At the same time, the fields 
diverge: Whereas sociologically-oriented social psychologists have long focused 
primarily on how categories foster &ldquo;inequality&rdquo; for specific social targets, psycho-
logically-oriented social psychologists tend to focus on the &ldquo;prejudices&rdquo; inside the 
mind of social perceivers. Clearly understanding both perspectives allows the most 
robust understanding of category-based disparate social outcomes. Fortunately, </p>

</p>
<p>researchers in both fields have begun to recognize the potential benefits of drawing 
from one another, issuing a call for increased collaboration (Eagly and Fine 2010). 
Moreover, existing work has already begun to draw from both sides, as we discuss 
in this chapter.
</p>
<p>The chapter starts by noting some classic sociology relevant to inequality, and 
then some related classic (and recent) psychology on prejudice-based inequality, 
focusing on mechanisms of interpersonal fluidity and cognitive economy. Then we 
turn to social (Fiske et al. 2002) categories that often yield inequality, introducing 
the stereotype content model as a conceptual framework, and then describing the 
psychology of reactions to the most salient categories (race, gender), as well as less-
studied ones (age, disability, sexuality, social class, and weight). We then note some 
broader psychological perspectives about who uses these categories, drawing from 
individual differences in societal attitudes, as well as from social cognition (auto-
maticity, ambiguity, ambivalence, complexity). We close with future opportunities 
for studying social categories.
</p>
<p>Classic Sociology: Categories (Indirectly)  
</p>
<p>Foster Structural Inequality
</p>
<p>To this day, sociological and psychological social psychology each are fundamen-
tally concerned with how people get categorized and sorted, both by inherent char-
acteristics (such as race and gender) as well as those that are more controllable 
(Foner 1979; Lieberson 2001).
</p>
<p>But whereas the construction of social categories has a formative history in so-
ciological social psychology, the idea that social sorting fosters inequalities came 
about indirectly, as inequality was not the primary concern of the field&rsquo;s theoreti-
cal innovators. Perspectives on category-based inequalities do date back to at least 
the late 1800s, when the French sociologist Emile Durkheim (1893/1964) first in-
troduced the notion of collective/common conscience, underscoring how societies 
maintain social order by shared thinking. For industrialized societies, a major part 
of common understanding centers on labor division among citizens, and the shared 
understanding that certain work will be rewarded more than others. Although this 
has the consequence of strengthening society as a whole, status inequalities may 
emerge, due to inevitable differences in valuing labor.
</p>
<p>Later sociological theories built upon the seminal idea that groups need shared 
values systems to flourish&mdash;again, showing indirectly how status imbalances can 
result from these systems. Resembling Durkheim&rsquo;s perspective, Moscovici&rsquo;s (1963) 
social representation theory proposes that social groups (including the larger soci-
ety) use a simplified, shared system of particular values, ideas, and practices to es-
tablish order, facilitate group member communication, and make sense of novel or 
troubling events. Whereas this implies the collective ability to simplify a complex 
world, inequality and exclusion (e.g., racism) can result from oversimplification of 
outgroup images (Potter and Wetherell 1998).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24512 Social Categories Create and Reflect Inequality
</p>
<p>Other classic works focus on the importance of societal roles, once again demon-
strating indirectly how they foster unequal categories. Dahrendorf&rsquo;s (1968) concep-
tion of homo sociologicus de-emphasizes narrow self-interests, instead emphasizing 
people&rsquo;s motive to fulfill roles in a broader social framework. This role orientation 
inevitably creates inequalities, given the fundamental unevenness of industrialized 
roles. As a more specific example, Talcott Parsons&rsquo; depiction of the nuclear fam-
ily includes the complementary roles of industrious men versus nurturing women; 
though designed to alleviate competition, these functions nevertheless foster gender 
stratification (Parsons and Bales 1955). Admittedly, people sometimes attempt to 
dissociate themselves from stereotypes associated with their own role, implement-
ing role distancing (such as a surgeon who jokes at the operating table to separate 
him/herself; Goffman 1972), especially if they perceive role-based inequalities as 
inhibiting their interpersonal relationships. Nevertheless, sometimes one&rsquo;s social 
role is too powerful to overcome, as reflected in the influential concept of the self-
fulfilling prophecy (Merton 1948). All this is to say that sociologists have long con-
sidered categories and inequality.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most currently influential classic theory of categories is status char-
acteristics theory (e.g., Berger et al. 1972; Ridgeway 1991), which argues that cer-
tain categories (e.g., being white, male, middle-aged) create expected competencies 
that create dynamics making self and others respond with dominance and deference 
accordingly, thereby perpetuating category-based status inequalities in prestige and 
resources. This approach fits well with psychological approaches that emphasize 
social categorization.
</p>
<p>Classic (and Recent) Psychology:  
</p>
<p>Prejudice-based Inequality
</p>
<p>Psychologists have long considered categories but only more recently considered 
their status per se. Psychologists seldom use the term inequality directly. Instead, 
the psychological conversation on social discrepancies often begins with Gordon 
Allport&rsquo;s classic definition of prejudice: &ldquo;an antipathy based on faulty and inflexible 
generalization [&hellip;] directed toward a group or an individual of that group&rdquo; (1954, 
p. 9). To this day, social psychologists continue to grapple with how social catego-
ries foster the antipathies (and other, more mixed emotions) that permeate particular 
intergroup perceptions and interactions. Although prejudice is not the only psy-
chological explanation for status inequalities, it is often implicated as the primary 
one&mdash;with theories of group-based power relations a close sibling.
</p>
<p>Various elements of psychological social psychology utilize functional perspec-
tives to explain how people&rsquo;s prejudices hold apparent psychological utility. This 
explains not only how inequalities form, but also how they persist. Two types of 
functional theories are particularly elucidating: early interpersonal fluidity theories, 
and later cognitive economy theories.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Interpersonal Fluidity
</p>
<p>The first contribution of psychological experimental social psychology was to 
demonstrate how flexible people are, both in the categories they expect others to 
fit&mdash;despite objective reality&mdash;and in how they influence others to respond accord-
ingly&mdash;despite their own individuality. That is, people misperceive others to fit cat-
egories more than they do, and then influence those others to fit those categories, 
showing that both perceivers and targets are flexible. All this categorical flexibility 
can be explained without recourse to motivation, namely, by the perceiver saving 
mental effort and by targets not bothering to resist. (These cognitive-economy prin-
ciples are elaborated next.)
</p>
<p>Reminiscent of self-fulfilling prophecy, but more psychology-specific, the role 
of expectations in fostering inequality is apparent in the idea of behavioral confir-
mation&mdash;the surprising impact of perceiver expectations on target behavior in an 
upcoming interaction. For instance, if a perceiver expects a target to be hostile, this 
can subtly cue the target actually to act in more hostile ways (Snyder and Swann 
1978). This is often conveyed nonverbally. Expectancies, based for example on 
race, can cause a White interviewer to exhibit less nonverbal immediacy; this in 
turn undermines the performance of the interviewee, causing both to feel that the 
interaction did not go well and that the other performed inadequately, confirming 
mutual racial stereotypes (Shelton and Richeson 2006; Word et al. 1974). Whether 
a perceiver&rsquo;s expectancy ultimately shapes a target&rsquo;s behavior depends upon a host 
of factors, including both the perceiver&rsquo;s and target&rsquo;s separate interpretations of the 
target&rsquo;s behaviors (Darley and Fazio 1980).
</p>
<p>Cognitive Economy
</p>
<p>Later functional theories focused on how category-based responses emerge from 
the preference for cognitive economy&mdash;in other words, people are cognitive misers 
who strive to conserve mental resources when navigating the social world (Fiske 
and Taylor 2013). By default, this conserving priority spurs people to pigeonhole 
others into broad categories, fostering inequalities. Nevertheless, sometimes peo-
ple can override these automatic biases if sufficiently motivated to do so. In psy-
chological social psychology, these two sides of the coin have given rise to a series 
of influential dual-process models of interpersonal perception, comprising both 
automatic biases and more deliberate, controllable processes that allow people to 
override them (e.g., Brewer 1988; Brewer and Harasty Feinstein 1999; Devine 
1989).
</p>
<p>As an example, the Continuum Model (Fiske et al. 1987; Fiske and Neuberg 
1990) theorizes that people form impressions on a continuum ranging from basic, 
automatic categories (age, gender, race) to elaborated, deliberate combination of 
aspects (individuating data). Beginning at the automatic end, people decide how 
far along the continuum they do go based upon their particular information and </p>

<p>24712 Social Categories Create and Reflect Inequality
</p>
<p>motivation, with evolving elaboration of processing. Thus, both Gestalt config-
ural processes (category-based impressions) and piecemeal, algebraic processes 
(individuating impressions) are at work.
</p>
<p>Physical features matter as well in automatic, interpersonal categorization, from 
ethnic characteristics to clothing (Stangor et al. 1992). Perceivers generally attune 
most to the most informative physical aspect, such as clothing style over color, or 
the combination of race and gender as opposed to either on its own. Other factors 
also matter in which categories are most saliently activated, such as the perceiver&rsquo;s 
availability of attentional resources and general pre-existing attitudes (Macrae and 
Bodenhausen 2000).
</p>
<p>Social Categories Often Yield Inequality
</p>
<p>The role of categorization&mdash;Allport&rsquo;s &ldquo;nouns that cut slices&rdquo;&mdash;is clear from both 
sociology and psychology, but the societal structure and comparison of common 
categories was incomplete. Appearing next is progress in understanding stereotype 
contents, their origins in social structure, their emotional concomitants, and the 
downstream discrimination.
</p>
<p>Stereotype Content Model
</p>
<p>Psychological research using the stereotype content model (SCM; Fiske et al. 2002) 
indicates that the dimensions of perceived warmth and competence are fundamental 
in people&rsquo;s perceptions of social groups. The warmth dimension answers the ques-
tion: &ldquo;How friendly and trustworthy are this other&rsquo;s intentions?&rdquo; which is the more 
immediate judgment that people make. The competence dimension answers the sec-
ondary question: &ldquo;How well can this other enact those intentions?&rdquo; From a simple 
classification along these two dimensions, four distinct clusters emerge, categoriz-
ing different social groups, with associated emotional prejudices (see Table 12.1): 
pride (high warmth, high competence, e.g., middle class), pity (high-low, e.g., older 
people), envy (low-high, e.g., rich people), and contempt (low-low, e.g., homeless 
people). This framework generates a society&rsquo;s social category map, applicable to 
the societal, interpersonal, and even neural level (Fiske et al. 2007). This perspec-
tive is similar to sociological social psychology, in its focus on the sociostructural 
origins of categories and the power of societal stratification systems (Massey 2007).
</p>
<p>From the SCM&rsquo;s two dimensions, different forms of inequality emerge. General-
ly, warmth is dictated by groups&rsquo; interdependence, or how cooperative-competitive 
groups appear. On the other hand, perceived competence correlates highly with 
status (in other words, people believe that &ldquo;you get what you deserve&rdquo; in society). 
Status of course speaks to inequality, but interdependence does too, as when one 
prioritizes the cooperative ingroup over the competitive outgroup, regardless of 
status.</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>Moreover, the SCM clusters predict different types of behavioral tendencies, 
as a result of emotional prejudices (see Table 12.1): Warmth stereotypes (asso-
ciated with pride, pity) determine active behavioral tendencies, eliciting active 
facilitation (helping, defending). Low warmth (cold stereotypes, associated with 
either envy or disgust) trigger the opposite active harm behaviors (harassing, 
bullying). Competence stereotypes (associated with either pride or envy) deter-
mine passive behavioral tendencies, eliciting passive facilitation (associating, 
complying). Low-competence stereotypes (associated with either pity or disgust) 
elicit passive harm (neglecting, excluding). Although themselves predicted by the 
stereotypes, the emotions are the proximate cause of the behavior (Cuddy et al. 
2007).
</p>
<p>Most relevant here, societies differ in their usage of the mixed, ambivalent clus-
ters (low on one dimension and high on the other) (Cuddy et al. 2009; Durante 
et al. 2012). In 3 dozen societies, greater societal income inequality predicts more 
ambivalently stereotyped societal groups, consistent with an unequal society&rsquo;s need 
to justify group advantage or advantage (allegedly, &ldquo;older people are poor but nice&rdquo;; 
&ldquo;investment bankers are rich but cold&rdquo;). Ambivalent stereotypes may sustain sys-
temic inequality.
</p>
<p>Drilling Down to the Dynamics of Particular Categories
</p>
<p>Referring, where relevant, to the stereotype dimensions warmth/interdependence 
x competence/status, we next identify several specific categories that social psy-
chologists have implicated in social inequality. We start with the two that have gar-
nered the most focus (race and gender) and then less-studied ones (age, disability, 
sexuality, social class, and weight). Afterward, we return to broader perspectives on 
individual determinants of category usage.

<p>24912 Social Categories Create and Reflect Inequality
</p>
<p>Race
</p>
<p>Primarily, psychological social psychology has focused on Black and White catego-
ries of inequality. In fact, some of the first studies in social psychology measured 
self-reported stereotypes of and attitudes toward different racial and ethnic groups 
(e.g., Bogardus 1933; Katz and Braly 1933; Thurstone 1928). This is similar to 
sociological social psychology, which has focused on race essentially since its in-
ception (Winant 2000).
</p>
<p>Later psychological work became more nuanced, in distinguishing between sub-
tle forms of racism and its more blatant manifestations. Typically, old-fashioned 
forms of race prejudice are overt; by contrast, the Dovidio&ndash;Gaertner idea of aversive 
racism (Dovidio et al. 1986; Gaertner and Dovidio 1986) speaks to a more com-
mon, subtle form of prejudice that may go unnoticed even by its perpetrators. Aver-
sive racism combines negative feelings and beliefs toward the outgroup along with 
paternalistic sympathy and denial of one&rsquo;s underlying negative attitudes (see also 
Katz et al. 1986). Even in the absence of blatant racism, more aversive forms create 
deleterious consequences, such as inhibiting voluntary interracial contact (Dovidio 
et al. 2002) and fostering pro-White-biased hiring decisions (Dovidio and Gaertner 
2000). Covert-overt prejudice distinctions have emerged in studies of other types of 
ethnic prejudice, too, and across multiple countries (Pettigew and Meertens 1995).
</p>
<p>Sociologists have similarly unearthed the powerful impact of subtle racial preju-
dices. One recent, landmark field experiment sent pairs of equally qualified job ap-
plicants (White versus Black or Latino) to seek low-wage jobs; not only were Black 
candidates half as likely to receive a callback or job offer, but minority applicants 
were equally likely as Whites with prison records (Pager et al. 2009). Such experi-
mental field research is a likely future direction for sociologists and psychologists 
alike, as both share an interest in real-world consequences of racial discrimina-
tion&mdash;which typically manifests in ways more covert than overt (Pager 2007).
</p>
<p>From the perspective of stereotype content, low-wage African Americans appear 
in the low-low part of the warmth x competence space, but so do poor Whites (Cud-
dy et al. 2007; Fiske et al. 2002). Likewise, Black professionals appear between 
generic competent-but-cold (presumably White) professionals and warm, compe-
tent genre middle class (also presumably White). Increasingly, the intersection of 
class and race will trump the simple category of race, and research will increasingly 
recognize the importance of subtypes (e.g., African Americans&rsquo; own subtypes for 
Blacks, see Fiske et al. 2009). Nevertheless, recent work offers hope for combat-
ing race-based identity threat in various domains (e.g., Cohen et al. 2012; Sherman 
et al. 2013).
</p>
<p>Gender
</p>
<p>Long after the race studies came investigations of sexism, which continues to be the 
second most frequent form of prejudice studied in psychology (APA 2012). Classic </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>social psychological studies of gender prejudice uprooted long-held beliefs about 
innate gender inequalities. Until the late 1960s, the most prevalent explanations 
treated masculinity and femininity as polar opposites and assumed that biologi-
cal gender differences solely accounted for gender inequalities. Then came others 
proposing a more nuanced approach, treating the two gender concepts as socially 
defined and complementary, rather than innate and opposing (Deaux 1984; Deaux 
and Major 1987).
</p>
<p>These influential, novel perspectives resulted in one of the earliest sexism mea-
sures, the Attitudes toward Women scale (ATW; Spence et al. 1973). Along with 
acting as a systematic, psychometric evaluation of gender stereotypes, the ATW 
also identified factors involved in how people come to endorse traditional sex roles 
and related inequalities. For instance, traditional male-female power hierarchies 
tend to be endorsed by particularly masculine men and feminine women, rather 
than more androgynous individuals (Spence et al. 1975).
</p>
<p>Later work on gendered roles and resulting inequalities emerged from Eagly&rsquo;s 
(e.g., 1987) social role theory. Similar to sociologists&rsquo; classic emphasis on social 
roles, and expectations states theory in particular, Eagly&rsquo;s approach stated that per-
ceptions of social groups derive from the societal parts that they each disproportion-
ately play. From this standpoint, perceptions fostered by traditional gender roles can 
appear to legitimize gender imbalances. For instance, because traditional gender 
division of labor more often places women inside the home, they are consequently 
perceived as low in agency. Such perceptions are surprisingly powerful in dictating 
gender-based behavioral expectations, even impacting the perceived effectiveness 
of leaders (depending on the extent to which job descriptions are framed in mascu-
line terms; Eagly et al. 1995).
</p>
<p>Gender prejudice investigations were also integral in revising Allport&rsquo;s original 
definition from pure antipathy to incorporate mixed reactions that include allegedly 
benign intent&mdash;as reflected in ambivalent sexism, which comprises both subjective-
ly benevolent and openly hostile forms (Glick and Fiske 1996). Ambivalent sexism 
results from the tension between male societal dominance and male-female intimate 
interdependence. As such, some forms of sexism derive from subjectively benevo-
lent intent&mdash;for instance, chivalrous behaviors (e.g., a contextually inappropriate 
compliment on attractiveness, subtly undermining competence) that nonetheless 
paternalize women as inferior. On the other hand, a negative, hostile side emerges 
if women are perceived as violating their prescriptive gender roles (Rudman and 
Glick 2001). Indeed, the endorsement of low-competence female stereotypes, tradi-
tional gender roles, and differential gender-based treatment reflects a modern neo-
sexism similar to its race-based counterpart (Swim et al. 1995; Tougas et al. 1995). 
The domain of feminist sociology has touched on many of the same themes (e.g., 
Ingraham 1994).
</p>
<p>What underlies the ambivalence are &ldquo;should&rdquo;-based, prescriptive gender stereo-
types, which attempt to dictate how women ought to behave, fulfilling traditional 
gender roles (Burgess and Borgida 1999; Prentice and Carranza 2002; Rudman 
1998). When women behave according to role-based expectations, they face de-
fault, benevolent sexism; when women do not comply, they put themselves at risk </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25112 Social Categories Create and Reflect Inequality
</p>
<p>for hostile backlash. For instance, when women act in threateningly agentic ways 
(countering expectations for being nice), they risk being passed over for jobs (Carli 
and Eagly 1999; Eagly and Karau 2002; Rudman and Glick 2001).
</p>
<p>Prescriptions tend to arise when groups are deeply interdependent (as men and 
women are); when groups need each other and interact regularly, and when the 
subjugation of one group directly benefits the other, the potential beneficiary has a 
vested interest to employ controlling stereotypes (Burgess and Borgida 1999; Pratto 
et al. 1997; Snizek and Neil 1992). The predominant contrasts in female stereo-
types&mdash;traditional and subordinate versus nontraditional and competitive&mdash;also fit 
the stereotype content data showing these types as respectively nice but incompetent 
versus competent but cold (Eckes 2002; Fiske et al. 2002). Again, the recognition 
of intersections and subtypes will likely move research closer to lived experience.
</p>
<p>Less-Studied Categories
</p>
<p>More rarely, psychological investigations center on age, disability, sexuality, social 
class, and weight.
</p>
<p>Age Though Robert Butler originally coined the term &ldquo;ageism&rdquo; in 1969, empirical and 
theoretical investigations are surprisingly sparse. Moreover, the majority of theoretical 
perspectives on the subject are general theories to explain a wide variety of other biases 
(North and Fiske 2012). One of the most common such approaches to ageim is terror 
management theory (Becker 1973), which focuses on people&rsquo;s reactions to death anxi-
ety and consequent motivation to maintain physical and psychological distance from 
older people (Greenberg et al. 2002). Another prominent social psychological theory 
used to explain ageism, social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner 1979), characterizes 
age prejudice as a means of maintaining self-esteem (i.e., identifying more strongly 
with young, ingroup members and pushing away older, outgroup members).
</p>
<p>Other general perspectives adapted for ageism focus on physical characteris-
tics in driving age-based stigma. One example of such stigmatizing trait inferences 
is negative halo effect, in which older people&rsquo;s perceived unattractiveness taints 
other trait judgments; another involves overgeneralization, in which certain traits 
are mistakenly inferred from mannerisms, such as loneliness from stooped posture. 
Yet another physical behavior-driven stigma derives from social affordances; in 
this sense, elders&rsquo; slow gait might signal low-interaction potential (Palmore 2003).
</p>
<p>Other general theories apply more broadly at the group level. An intragroup re-
lations-based, sociofunctional perspective posits older people as nonreciprocating, 
which may foster anger and resentment among other group members (Cottrell and 
Neuberg 2005). Sociohistorical accounts cite historical causes that have rendered 
older people as a relatively useless social group (e.g., the advent of the printing 
press, the industrial revolution, improved education, and better medical care; Cuddy 
and Fiske 2002; Nelson 2005). Similarly, the already-noted social-role perspective 
(Eagly 1987) would link older people&rsquo;s predominant societal roles (e.g., retired) 
with stereotypes (e.g., low agency; Kite and Wagner 2002).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>252 M. S. North and S. T. Fiske
</p>
<p>Also taking into account the role of social structure in fostering elder percep-
tions is the stereotype content model (SCM; Fiske et al. 2007; Fiske et al. 2002). As 
a group, older people are a social group spurring pity: perceived as high in warm 
intentions (friendly, trustworthy) but low in competence (unable to enact those in-
tentions). These perceptions stem from older people&rsquo;s default social standing as 
low-status and noncompetitive (Cuddy et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>The default pity response presupposes the predominant structure of age groups, 
which fosters expectations for age-group turn-taking. Typically, younger and old-
er people take a low-status backseat to middle-agers, whose relative prosperity is 
both recognized and legitimized across age groups (ESS 2008; Garstka et al. 2004, 
2005). We implicate this progression in driving prescriptive expectations among 
the young for older people to step aside and make way for younger generations 
(North and Fiske 2012). Thus, like the SCM, this kind of multilevel psychological 
perspective takes into account how structural relationships between groups predict 
psychological downstream reactions, and how interdependence and status are ma-
jor drivers of stereotypes, emotional prejudices, and discriminatory behavior (e.g., 
Fiske et al. 2007).
</p>
<p>Recent developments in ageism propose a more &ldquo;should&rdquo;-based, prescriptive 
form, which subtly nudges older people aside to make way for younger genera-
tions (North and Fiske 2012, 2013a). These tensions comprise at least three distinct 
domains: active Succession of enviable resources (wealth, employment), passive 
Consumption of shared resources (government funding, public space), and avoid-
ance of symbolic Identity resources (activities or roles traditionally reserved for 
younger people). When older people do not conform to expectations concerning 
these practical and figurative resources, they risk facing resentment from aspiring 
younger people eager to maintain or enhance their own social standing.
</p>
<p>Like many groups in the stereotype content space, age-based prejudice is com-
monly ambivalent, deriving from the perception that older people are high in warmth 
but low in competence (Cuddy et al. 2005), typically relegating them to a low-status 
societal position. Similar to ambivalent sexism, this default, subjectively benevo-
lent perception has the potential to transform into something more hostile if elders 
are perceived as violating prescriptive age stereotypes (such as delaying retirement 
and blocking younger people from entering the workforce) or something more be-
nevolent, if elders cooperate with stereotypic injunctions to step aside (North and 
Fiske 2012, 2013a).
</p>
<p>Disability Research on disability prejudice has often been closely linked with 
stigma. In one classic study, participants were assigned to interact with another 
person&mdash;a confederate&mdash;who either ostensibly was missing a leg (thanks to a spe-
cially constructed wheelchair) or was not. People were far more likely to choose 
to cut short the interaction with the ostensibly handicapped person, and indicated a 
greater level of discomfort (Kleck 1966).
</p>
<p>One explanation for people&rsquo;s uneasiness with the physically disabled is the nov-
elty associated with the disability (Langer 1976). However, an important mediating 
factor in this perception is whether or not the disability is perceived as control-
lable (Weiner et al. 1988); similar to physical illness-based stigma, ailments that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25312 Social Categories Create and Reflect Inequality
</p>
<p>are viewed as controllable are most likely to yield social rejection (Crandall and 
Moriarty 1995). In the stereotype content space, people with physical disabilities 
land in the pity quadrant, as do people with developmental delays or dementia, 
consistent with a bad outcome that is not their fault (Weiner et al. 1988), but drug 
addicts (arguably a mental disability) land in the disgust quadrant, consistent with 
blaming them for their condition (Cuddy et al. 2007; Fiske et al. 2002).
</p>
<p>Sexuality Sexuality often drives inequalities, as anyone following the current 
political climate can attest. Until recently, the majority of American adults have 
believed that homosexuality is wrong and unnatural (Herek and Capitanio 1996; 
Herek and McLemore 2013). In fact, a common explanation for such prejudice 
is perpetrators&rsquo; underlying discomfort with their own sexual impulses or gender 
(non)conformity (particularly among men; Herek 2000). Holding prejudice toward 
homosexuals may also serve a self-esteem purpose of reinforcing a positive sense 
of oneself as a &ldquo;good Christian&rdquo; (Herek 1987).
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, various indicators suggest that sexuality-based prejudices are on 
the decline. The political zeitgeist of the early 2000s has resulted in a massive in-
crease in states allowing gay marriage. Heterosexuals who believe in the immuta-
bility of sexual orientation tend to be less prejudiced toward homosexuals, feeling 
that they cannot change the way they are (Hegarty 2002). In the stereotype content 
space, generic gay men are rated neutrally on both dimensions, but a closer ex-
amination suggests this to be an averaging across common subtypes (Clausell and 
Fiske 2005). Lesbians are generally rated as cold but competent, along with other 
women who challenge traditional gender roles (Eckes 2002). Whereas sexuality 
studies have predominantly emerged in psychology, a call for increasing sociologi-
cal approaches has emerged as well, given the field&rsquo;s closely related focus on gen-
der (Stein and Plummer 1994).
</p>
<p>Social Class Despite boasts of the United States&rsquo; classless society (characterized by 
American Dream ideals that anyone can be successful by working hard), social class 
categories undoubtedly maintain social inequalities. For instance, recent psycho-
logical research has found that first generation college students demonstrate greater 
interdependent motives for attending college (e.g., &ldquo;bring honor to my family&rdquo;) 
than do continuing generation college students. On the other hand, the latter seek to 
fulfill more independent motives (e.g., &ldquo;explore potential in many domains&rdquo;). Nev-
ertheless, colleges tend to focus disproportionately on independence, presenting a 
cultural mismatch that fosters subtle inequalities (Stephens et al. in-press).
</p>
<p>Even though Americans do not overwhelmingly identify as middle class (con-
trary to popular belief, people split equally between working and middle class), 
Americans do broadly endorse work-ethic values to explain social-status dispari-
ties (Fiske 2011). Applied to perceptions of poor people, these shared values miti-
gate the default prejudices against poor people, who are normally viewed as hav-
ing uncooperative, exploitative intent, as well being generally incompetent (Fiske 
et al. 2002; Russell and Fiske 2008). Homeless people in particular are especially 
viewed with disgust (Harris and Fiske 2006). However, when a low-income person 
is specifically described as hard-working, that person is given more credit than a </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>254 M. S. North and S. T. Fiske
</p>
<p>hard-working rich person (Russell and Fiske, under review). Social class too has its 
subtypes.
</p>
<p>A neglected topic is images of the rich, who universally land in the competent-
but-cold quadrant of stereotype content; they elicit envy, which leads too Schaden-
freude, malicious glee at their misfortunes (Cikara and Fiske 2012). Although psy-
chologists are just beginning to investigate social class as an important phenomenon 
driving social inequalities, sociology has an established tradition of doing so. In 
particular, sociologists have spent considerable focus on the rise in concentrated 
disadvantage in the inner cities, which has resulted in a loss of upward mobility for 
many in the lower class (Wilson 1987).
</p>
<p>Weight Also under psychology&rsquo;s radar is the role of people&rsquo;s body mass in fos-
tering antifat prejudice (Crandall 1994). Weight bias permeates various sectors&mdash;
even healthcare circles specializing in obesity (Schwartz et al. 2003)&mdash;and spans at 
least five continents (Crandall et al. 2001). Common correlates of antifat beliefs are 
blame, conservative political attitudes, and belief in a just world, suggesting that 
people legitimize weight-based inequalities as righteous punishment of social devi-
ants (Crandall and Biernat 1990). Although never to our knowledge studied in the 
stereotype-content space, obese people elicit disgust reactions consistent with the 
default being to blame them for their condition (Krendl et al. 2006).
</p>
<p>Who Uses Categories and When?
</p>
<p>Thus far, this chapter has noted general sociological and psychological approach-
es to category-based status differentiation, as well as describing general societal 
dimensions of specific outgroup stereotypes that differ on status/competence and 
warmth/interdependence, both within the stereotype content model and within the 
respective category literatures. We now turn to moderator variable: individual dif-
ferences and circumstances that encourage or discourage category use.
</p>
<p>Individuals Differ in Endorsing Structural,  
</p>
<p>Group-based Hierarchy
</p>
<p>Certainly the SCM is not the only example of psychology successfully examin-
ing the social structure of hierarchy. Another example is social dominance theory, 
which we here limit to social dominance orientation (SDO; Sidanius and Pratto 
1999), identifying how people&rsquo;s beliefs about group hierarchies legitimate systemic 
inequalities. Going beyond mere ingroup-outgroup factors, the theory explains how 
certain people are more predisposed than others to endorse the mere idea that some 
groups are better and more deserving than others (encapsulated by measurement 
items such as &ldquo;Some groups of people are simply inferior to other groups&rdquo; and &ldquo;If 
certain groups stayed in their place, we would have fewer problems&rdquo;; Pratto et al. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25512 Social Categories Create and Reflect Inequality
</p>
<p>1994). Thus, the theory takes into account both the sociostructural elements (how 
groups are organized), and their impact on individual worldviews. SDO moderates 
beliefs that status and competence are virtually equivalent (Oldmeadow and Fiske 
2007).
</p>
<p>Individuals Differ in Justifying the System
</p>
<p>In a similar vein, system justification theory (Jost and Banaji 1994; Jost et al. 2004) 
posits that people prefer sociostructural, organizational (&ldquo;system&rdquo;) stability, rather 
than equality between social groups, and thus explain societal rank accordingly. 
System justification endorsement differs across individuals. System justification 
may relate to one part of SDO, opposition to equality beliefs (the other part, general 
&ldquo;group-based dominance,&rdquo; is closely tied to one&rsquo;s social identity beliefs that spur 
ingroup favoritism; Kugler et al. 2010). System justification theory predicts that, 
although ingroup favoritism is typical, low-status groups may actually favor high-
status ones, to perpetuate system stability.
</p>
<p>When Do People Categorize? Perspectives  
</p>
<p>from Social Cognition
</p>
<p>Social cognition research specializes in gauging how social actors perceive the so-
cial world. Getting inside the heads of social perceivers, as they are making sense 
of the social world, suggests when people use categories: when they are often auto-
matic, sometimes ambiguous, and ultimately complex.
</p>
<p>Automaticity of Social Categories
</p>
<p>As noted earlier under general psychological theories, dual-process frameworks 
conceptualize people&rsquo;s tendency to prefer automatic impressions of others. Indeed, 
when we first encounter another person, we immediately infer race, gender, and age 
(e.g., Fiske 1998; Kite et al. 1991; Kunda 1999), the first step in status divides. Al-
though this categorical ability helps people make quick sense of their social world, 
it also has the unfortunate consequence of triggering status-maintaining stereotypes 
and prejudices. Nevertheless, depending on their individually and contextually 
primed goals and motives, people can overcome these automatic categories under 
certain circumstances.
</p>
<p>General Automaticity Target people belong to several social categories, and 
automatic processes determine when perceivers use which ones. Particular catego-
ries may seem more or less relevant in the mind of the social perceiver; ones that 
are frequently primed are chronically accessible (Bargh et al. 1986; Higgins et al. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>256 M. S. North and S. T. Fiske
</p>
<p>1977). Individual differences factor heavily in which categories become chronically 
accessible; for instance, different people value different traits (e.g., intelligence) in 
evaluating others and thus more likely remember and describe other people in those 
terms (Higgins and King 1981). Chronically accessible social categories matter too 
(Z&aacute;rate and Smith 1990); for example, given limited information, some people rely 
on existing, chronic gender schemas when judging advertisements for female politi-
cal candidates (Chang and Hitchon 2004).
</p>
<p>More recent work uses event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to underscore how 
quickly people differentiate among social categories. For instance, people spontane-
ously attune particularly to other people, reacting more rapidly than to nonhuman 
counterparts (Ito and Cacioppo 2000; Ito et al. 1998). Related work shows that 
people make similarly rapid Black-versus-White and male-versus-female distinc-
tions from the first moments of perception (Ito and Urland 2003). The automatic 
categorizations evidently occur regardless of individual motives because of shared 
cultural context.
</p>
<p>Automatic categorization is one process; spontaneous bias is another. Perhaps 
the most powerful demonstration of how accumulated cultural experience makes 
people associate other groups with certain (often negative) evaluation is the implicit 
association test (IAT; Greenwald et al. 1998, 2002; Nosek et al. 2007). For an array 
of social categories, this prominent method has shown how people more readily as-
sociate certain social groups with positive words (e.g., Whites and nice) and others 
with negative words (e.g., Blacks and hostile)&mdash;though this effect is stronger for 
White participants than Black ones (Nosek et al. 2002). Although some have criti-
cized the IAT as simply assessing widely-known cultural beliefs, and others have 
questioned whether it truly measures attitudes (as opposed to mere cognitive asso-
ciations), arguably no other individual paradigm has spurred as much work on the 
unconscious processes linked to social category information. And the IAT predicts 
interpersonal feelings, decisions, and behavior, so it behaves as attitudes do.
</p>
<p>Race-Specific Automaticity Part of social psychology&rsquo;s &ldquo;dual-process&rdquo; move-
ment, Devine&rsquo;s dissociation model (1989) distinguishes between automatic and 
controlled processes in stereotyping. On the automatic side, stereotype activation 
does not require conscious attention&mdash;and seems inevitable whenever a White per-
ceiver encounters a Black person or a symbolic representation of one, due to shared 
cultural knowledge of racial stereotypes. However, the other half of the model 
acknowledges that individual personal beliefs that can overcome stereotype activa-
tion if the individual were sufficiently motivated and able to do so.
</p>
<p>Recent studies of implicit racial bias corroborate Devine&rsquo;s model. For example, 
demonstrating the automaticity of culturally held, racial stereotypes, people more 
rapidly identify guns and more readily misidentify tools as guns when primed with 
Black faces than White ones (Payne 2001). However, demonstrating the more con-
trolled side of the model, over time people can learn to override implicit biases. 
For example, in a simulated decision-to-shoot task involving Black and White tar-
gets, highly trained police officers are less trigger-happy than ordinary civilians in 
identifying the correct targets to shoot, despite being similarly prone to automatic 
racial bias (Correll et al. 2007). Such work shows that motives and goals do matter.</p>

<p>25712 Social Categories Create and Reflect Inequality
</p>
<p>Face-Specific Automaticity Underlying most social categories, the human face is 
one source of interpersonal categorization. Even with exceptionally short exposures 
to emotionally neutral faces (as little as 38 ms; Bar et al. 2006), people automati-
cally evaluate faces on multiple trait dimensions, composing two overall dimen-
sions: trustworthiness and dominance (Oosterhof and Todorov 2008). Spontaneous 
face judgments portend a variety of social ramifications, including criminal sen-
tencing decisions, where faces with more stereotypically Black features are more 
likely to receive a death sentence (Eberhardt et al. 2006). Facial judgments of 
(male) competence predict political election outcomes with almost 70 % accuracy 
(Ballew and Todorov 2007; Todorov et al. 2005), though such judgments can also 
be skewed depending on skin tone (Maddox and Gray 2002). Despite little evi-
dence that facial judgments reliably predict abilities (apparent face-based compe-
tence does not predict actual competence), these often arbitrary judgments foster 
real social inequalities.
</p>
<p>Even within the face, eye gaze direction influences automatic interpersonal cat-
egorical judgments. People more rapidly gender categorize targets with direct eye 
gaze (Macrae et al. 2005). That is, people most rapidly discern the gender of those 
most likely to be relevant to immediate interaction, namely, someone looking at 
them.
</p>
<p>The face is a source of spontaneous categorization for race processing as well. 
Resembling IAT work, people primed with concepts typically associated with cer-
tain racial groups (e.g., basketball) more readily identify faces belonging to the 
associated categories (i.e., Black males; Eberhardt et al. 2004). Altogether sponta-
neous categorizations anchor most interactions, though motives and goals do mod-
erate their effects.
</p>
<p>Ambiguity in Categories
</p>
<p>Categorization has ambiguous effects. For example, ingroup-outgroup distinctions 
magnify the effects of categories. That is, people&rsquo;s views of ingroup members are 
more detailed than those of outgroup members; this yields the consequence of more 
extreme, polarized views of outgroup members (Linville and Jones 1980). For in-
stance, Black prospective law school applicants garner more favorable views than 
comparable White applicants when armed with strong credentials, but harsher views 
when possessing weak credentials. Thus, the role of race is ambiguous; Blacks are 
not always more negative, but more extreme under some conditions.
</p>
<p>Still, also ambiguous is that the general tendency to favor the ingroup does not 
necessitate outgroup derogation (Brewer 1999). Favoring the ingroup has the zero-
sum consequence of disadvantaging people not &ldquo;like us.&rdquo; But preferring one&rsquo;s own 
kind is a more ambiguous prejudice than unabashed rejection of the outgroup. Sta-
tus perpetuates through ingroup favoritism.
</p>
<p>Uncovering the social construction of categories has further muddied the am-
biguity of social categories, once thought to be definitively biological. For in-
stance, acknowledging the symbolic, cultural meanings of race and gender avoids </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>258 M. S. North and S. T. Fiske
</p>
<p>oversimplified, unindividuating perspectives; this allows better understanding of 
how inequalities are socially constructed and not predetermined by biology (Glenn 
1999). Given the repeated absence of conclusive biological, genetic markers (e.g., 
Nisbett 2009), social determinants of race in particular mark its undeniable social 
inequalities (Smedley and Smedley 2005). Overall, with globalization, intermar-
riage, intersectional identities, and social change, social categories are becoming 
more volatile (dynamic), uncertain (incomplete), complex (indeterminate), and am-
biguous (unclear) (Bodenhausen and Peery 2009). Perhaps categories are also dilut-
ing, ambiguating, subtyping, and contextualizing as a result.
</p>
<p>Complexity of Categories
</p>
<p>Though originally stereotypes seemed rigid and resistant to change, later work 
showed that categories can get complicated, yielding multiple subtypes. For in-
stance, though as noted the default perception of older people typically combines 
warmth and incompetence, people recognize the kindly &ldquo;grandmother,&rdquo; the dis-
tinguished &ldquo;elder statesman,&rdquo; the lonely &ldquo;senior citizen,&rdquo; the &ldquo;John Wayne con-
servative,&rdquo; and the wise &ldquo;sage&rdquo; (Brewer et al. 1981; Schmidt and Boland 1986). 
Moreover, people distinguish the relatively healthy and active &ldquo;young-old&rdquo; and the 
&ldquo;old-old,&rdquo; despite the common tendency to group &ldquo;senior citizens&rdquo; as one group 
(Neugarten 1974; North and Fiske 2013b). Similar subdistinctions for gender in-
clude the &ldquo;athletic woman&rdquo; and the &ldquo;blue-collar working man&rdquo; (Deaux et al. 1985; 
Eckes 2002).
</p>
<p>How does subtyping fit into changing categories? One description of the psy-
chology of stereotype change suggests three different, possible models: (1) a book-
keeping process, in which extant stereotype content modifies gradually over time, 
(2) a more rapid, conversion whereby stereotype changes suddenly in the presence 
of a dramatic instance, and (3) a subtyping mechanism that adds subcategories to 
the existing stereotype content to apply it to more instances (Weber and Crocker 
1983).
</p>
<p>Future Opportunities
</p>
<p>Clearly much remains for social psychologists interested in hierarchy. Psycholo-
gists may need to regain their &ldquo;sociological imagination,&rdquo; reincorporating the struc-
tural perspectives that at one point developed hand-in-hand with individual-level 
psychological inquiry (Oishi et al. 2009). On both sides, bridging the two sides has 
become something of a lost art, with each increasingly specializing with their own, 
both in theme (distal societal influences versus proximal individual behavior) and 
in primary methodology (quantitative versus mixed approaches). But it does not 
have to be that way.</p>

</p>
<p>Until now, however, intergroup biases have been by some indicators the social 
psychology field&rsquo;s top topic (Fiske 2002). Social psychologists have much to offer, 
serving as a citation hub, a discipline that translates more biological approaches 
(health outcomes, social neuroscience, social evolution) to more macro sociological 
approaches (Fiske and Molm 2010).

<p>Status hierarchies are a pervasive feature of human and animal societies, organizing 
individuals along a shared understanding of respect and influence. Group mem-
bers at the top of a hierarchy are afforded several benefits, including greater access 
to valued resources (e.g., food, money, mating opportunities) and greater power 
over lower-ranking members. But hierarchies have broader benefits for the entire 
group as well, improving group efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity (Halevy 
et al. 2011; Ronay et al. 2012). These dynamics are evident in the status hierarchies 
of modern, democratic political systems. Hierarchical order within politics allows 
those with high status to determine the course of laws, presumably improving the 
effectiveness of the decision-making process. Meanwhile, earning the respect and 
votes of a majority of citizens brings with it specific benefits. High-status politi-
cians surround themselves with a legion of staffers and interns who cater to their 
needs. Politicians also leverage their political sway to reap financial benefits for 
their constituents and for themselves. Compare this to a low-status position, like an 
intern who instead must do as he is told in order to gain access to his bosses&rsquo; control 
of laws and finances, and is most likely underpaid, if paid at all.
</p>
<p>But if you ask a politician why he wants an elected position, neither the perks 
of high status nor the hassles of low status will be mentioned. Instead, the politi-
cian will likely rely on an assertive, confident behavioral style to accentuate some 
verbal answer that emphasizes his many strengths and his opponent&rsquo;s weaknesses. 
In political settings, these dominant behaviors may be further evident in public fo-
rums like impassioned speeches or fiery head-to-head debates. These displays of 
social dominance and competitive behaviors represent one important route to attain-
ing high status in both human and animal societies (Anderson and Kilduff 2009a; 
Cheng et al. 2013; Mazur and Booth 1998). Similar responses occur in many animal 
social groups where competitions for status often take the form of overtly aggres-
sive behaviors when status is challenged (Mazur and Booth 1998). The nascent field 
of social endocrinology, which studies the intersection of behavioral endocrinology </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>270 E. L. Knight and P. H. Mehta
</p>
<p>and social-personality psychology, provides insights into the role of dynamic, hor-
monal systems in regulating these behaviors in pursuit of not just political status, 
but of status in any hierarchy.
</p>
<p>For over 150 years, hormones&mdash;chemical messengers secreted from endocrine 
glands that communicate with systems throughout the body including the central 
nervous system&mdash;have been studied in animals as effectors of physiological and be-
havioral change. The earliest experimental work demonstrated that some unknown 
chemical from reimplanted testes could prevent the loss of typical male morphology 
(e.g., combs and waddles) and behavior (e.g., crowing) in a castrated rooster (Ber-
thold 1849; Soma 2006). Later work identified this chemical as the hormone testos-
terone and showed that it is responsible for these and other forms of virility, like the 
development of specialized anatomy (e.g., deer&rsquo;s antlers; Lincoln et al. 1972) and 
the propensity to behave aggressively during the mating season (Wingfield et al. 
1990). From these early roots, the field has expanded to explore other hormones, 
increasingly complex behaviors, and most recently has begun examining hormones 
and social processes in humans (Mehta and Josephs 2011).
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we review the neuroendocrine systems that influence and respond 
to the behaviors that govern status. We focus on hormones and status in human hier-
archies, but we rely on animal work to inform our discussion. We selectively review 
separate lines of research on testosterone and cortisol before turning to recent evi-
dence on the interaction between these two hormones in status hierarchies. Sections 
on estradiol and oxytocin follow, and we conclude by examining future directions 
for research on the interplay between hormones and hierarchies.
</p>
<p>Testosterone
</p>
<p>Testosterone (T), a steroid hormone derived from cholesterol, is primarily produced 
in the testes in males, the ovaries in females, and in the adrenal glands in both 
sexes. T belongs to a class of hormones called androgens, which are those hormones 
that are responsible for the development and maintenance of masculine character-
istics (Wu and Shah 2011). Secretion of T results from the coordinated action of 
the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
(GnRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) 
and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. LH and FSH then 
stimulate secretion of T from the gonads (Payne and Hales 2004). Higher levels of 
circulating testosterone are associated with increased dominant behaviors in several 
animal species. This relationship is strongest when social rank within the hierarchy 
is unstable. Sapolsky&rsquo;s (1991) research on wild baboons showed that during periods 
of social instability, due in part to an injured, alpha male within the baboon troop, 
T was positively related to aggressive and dominant behaviors. In times of stability, 
there was no relationship between T and these behaviors, a pattern seen in several 
other species as well (cichlid fish, Oliveira et al. 1996; lamb, Ruiz-de-la-Torre and 
Manteca 1999; birds, Wingfield et al. 1990). The animal literature thus suggests </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27113 Hormones and Hierarchies
</p>
<p>that high-T levels motivate individuals to seek out higher status when social status 
is up for grabs.
</p>
<p>The association between T and status pursuit also extends to humans. Social 
dominance tends to be associated with higher-basal T levels in both men and wom-
en (reviewed in Archer 2006; Mazur and Booth 1998; Carre et al. 2011; Eisenegger 
et al. 2011). T also influences affective and attentional processes related to status, 
increasing vigilance and emotional reactivity toward dominance cues, such as an-
gry, threatening faces (Hermans et al. 2008; Terburg et al. 2012; van Honk et al. 
1999; Wirth and Schultheiss 2007) and decreasing vigilance toward submissive 
cues such as fearful faces (van Honk et al. 2005). These effects of T on attention are 
thought to be unconscious, given that the effects of T are strongest when dominant 
and submissive faces are presented outside of conscious awareness (van Honk et al. 
2005; Terburg et al. 2012; Wirth and Schultheiss 2007).
</p>
<p>Basal Testosterone&rsquo;s Role in Status Seeking
</p>
<p>The findings reviewed above are consistent with the hypothesis that T levels influ-
ence status-seeking motivation. To provide more direct tests of T&rsquo;s role in the desire 
for status, several studies were conducted in which social status was experimentally 
manipulated, primarily in dyadic competitive social interactions. In eight different 
studies, basal T was measured in saliva before a status manipulation, after which 
various affective, cognitive, physiological, and behavioral outcomes were measured 
(Jones and Josephs 2006; Josephs et al. 2003, 2006; Mehta et al. 2008; Newman 
et al. 2005). In all of these studies, the interaction between basal T and status pre-
dicted the outcomes under investigation. For example, high-T individuals who lost 
status performed poorly on complex cognitive tasks, paid more attention to status 
cues, and exhibited increases in negative affect (Josephs et al. 2006). High-T indi-
viduals who gained status showed the opposite pattern of response, performing well 
on complex cognitive tasks, paying less attention to status cues, and showing no 
signs of increased negative mood. Mehta et al. (2008) further showed that high-T 
individuals who lost status rose in cortisol, a neuroendocrine marker of psycho-
logical stress. Meanwhile, high-T individuals who gained status dropped in cortisol. 
Taken together, these results suggest that high-basal T levels are linked to a drive for 
high status. High-T individuals who achieve high-status experience psychological 
comfort (e.g., low negative affect) and adaptive functioning (e.g., strong cognitive 
performance). High-T individuals who fail to achieve high-status experience psy-
chological distress (e.g., cortisol increases, high negative affect) and maladaptive 
functioning (e.g., poor cognitive performance).
</p>
<p>Low-T individuals in these same studies reacted differently to changes in status. 
In some studies low-T individuals reacted to low and high status similar to individu-
als in control conditions in which status level was not experimentally manipulated 
(Newman et al. 2005) or was not threatened (Josephs et al. 2003). These results 
suggest that low-T individuals lack the strong drive for high status found in high-T </p>
<p/>

<p>272 E. L. Knight and P. H. Mehta
</p>
<p>individuals. In other studies, low-T individuals found high-status positions aver-
sive. When placed in high-status positions, low-T people were hypervigilant to sta-
tus cues, showed elevated physiological arousal, and performed worse at cognitive 
tasks compared to low-T individuals placed in low-status positions (Josephs et al. 
2006). These results suggest that when thrust into high-ranking positions, low-T 
individuals may experience arousal and maladaptive functioning out of a desire to 
return to a more comfortable low-status position. Thus, T may orient individuals 
toward or away from high status and influence psychological and behavioral re-
sponses within a hierarchy.
</p>
<p>Women have approximately one-third the concentrations of T in saliva relative 
to men, but there were no sex differences in the predictive power of basal T on 
reactions to changes in status in these studies. Men and women high in T relative 
to other individuals of the same sex reacted negatively to a drop in status (Josephs 
et al. 2003, 2006; Mehta et al. 2008; Newman et al. 2005). Men and women low in 
T relative to other individuals of the same sex showed neutral (Josephs et al. 2003; 
Mehta et al. 2008; Newman et al. 2005) or negative reactions (Josephs et al. 2006) 
to a rise in status. These findings suggest that basal T is a biological marker of 
chronic status-seeking motivation in both men and women.

<p>Basal T&rsquo;s role in behavior within status hierarchies is not limited to dyadic social 
interactions. Other work indicates that a group&rsquo;s specific composition of basal T and 
social rank may help (or undermine) group cohesion and effectiveness. In one study 
of 579 students enrolled in an introductory organizational behavior course, students 
provided saliva samples and were randomly assigned to small work groups. The 
groups worked on various projects over the course of a semester (Zyphur et al. 
2009). Group members rated one another on status, and measures of overall group 
effectiveness were collected (group efficacy). There was no direct association be-
tween basal T and social status, but the (mis)match between T and status was asso-
ciated with group functioning. Those groups in which high-T individuals had high 
status and low-T individuals had low status reported greater group efficacy than 
those groups in which low-T individuals had high status and high-T individuals had 
low status. These findings provide further evidence that high-T individuals are more 
comfortable in high-status positions than low-T individuals, which in turn impacts 
group functioning. When there is a match between basal T and status attainment 
(high-T individuals with high status, low-T individuals with low status), the group 
functions well. But when there is a mismatch between basal T and status attainment 
(low-T individuals with high status, high-T individuals with low status), the group 
functions poorly (c.f., Josephs et al. 2006) (see Ronay et al. 2012 for findings on 
prenatal testosterone exposure and group effectiveness).

<p>Acute Changes in Testosterone and Status Seeking
</p>
<p>The studies reported above examined basal T as a stable trait and demonstrated 
its association with status-seeking behaviors. However, not only does T influence </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>27313 Hormones and Hierarchies
</p>
<p>behavior, but behavior and the social environment influence T levels. Specifically, 
T concentrations fluctuate around basal levels in status-relevant social settings. Ac-
cording to the reciprocal model of T and status, a rise or drop in status should influ-
ence T levels, and these rapid T fluctuations should produce a reciprocal effect by 
influencing subsequent status-seeking behaviors (Mazur and Booth 1998). In par-
ticular, scholars have speculated that T increases may encourage further attempts at 
gaining status, while T decreases may lead individuals to flee the situation to avoid 
any further loss of status.
</p>
<p>Empirical support for this reciprocal model comes from research in competi-
tions, modeled in real-world sporting events and rigged laboratory settings. Several 
studies have shown that winners&rsquo; T concentrations increase relative to losers for a 
few hours following a competition (reviewed in Archer 2006; Mazur and Booth 
1998; Salvador and Costa 2009; van Anders and Watson 2006). Intriguingly, this 
win-lose effect can occur in vicarious experiences of winning or losing as well, 
such as in sports fans or in supporters of political candidates. In a study of soccer 
fans watching a match, fans of the winning team increased in T compared to fans 
of the losing team (Bernhardt et al. 1998). And in the 2008 Presidential Election, 
supporters of losing candidates (John McCain or Robert Barr) dropped in T relative 
to supporters of the winning candidate (Barack Obama) in the hours following the 
announcement of the election results (Stanton et al. 2009).
</p>
<p>These effects of victory and defeat on T responses are not always found, sug-
gesting a role for other psychosocial and physiological variables in modulating 
the post-competition T response. For example, implicit power motivation&mdash;an in-
dividual difference factor associated with an unconscious desire to obtain high-
status positions&mdash;moderated the effects of victory and defeat on changes in T in one 
study (Schultheiss et al. 2005). High-power individuals rose in T after victory and 
dropped in T after defeat; low-power individuals showed the opposite pattern of 
T changes. Presumably, people high in power motive are chronically motivated to 
gain status. Thus, when their status drops, these individuals react strongly by drop-
ping in T. When their status rises, they react strongly by rising in T. Other modera-
tors of the win-lose effect on T changes include the cognitive and affective response 
to the competition (Salvador and Costa 2009), biological factors such as basal hor-
mone profiles (Mehta and Josephs 2010), personality traits (trait anxiety, Maner 
et al. 2008), and environmental factors (home versus away game, Carr&eacute; 2009).
</p>
<p>Although this literature has uncovered several factors that predict T changes 
after changes in status, researchers had assumed that status-induced fluctuations 
in T influenced future status-seeking behaviors. Mehta and Josephs (2006) con-
ducted the first empirical study in humans that examined the relationship between 
postcompetition T changes and subsequent social behavior. Status was experimen-
tally manipulated with a rigged laboratory competition, and saliva samples were 
collected before and after the competition to measure changes in T (Mehta and 
Josephs 2006). After competing and after providing the second saliva sample, par-
ticipants were given the option of competing against the same opponent in a second 
competition or completing an alternative, noncompetitive task (Mehta and Josephs 
2006). Individuals who lost the competition and whose T concentration rose were </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>274 E. L. Knight and P. H. Mehta
</p>
<p> significantly more likely to choose to compete again than individuals who lost and 
whose T concentration dropped. Another study showed the same pattern of findings 
with measures of aggressive behavior (Carr&eacute; et al. 2009; see also Carr&eacute; et al. 2011). 
These findings are consistent with the reciprocal model and suggest that a rise in T 
after a drop in status motivates further attempts at gaining status, while a drop in T 
after a drop in status motivates individuals to avoid any further loss of status.
</p>
<p>All together, the research on T in humans suggests that basal T taps into a per-
son&rsquo;s chronic status-seeking motivation, analogous to a personality trait, whereas 
short-term changes in T tap into a person&rsquo;s state status-seeking motivation, analo-
gous to mood (cf. Mehta et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>Cortisol
</p>
<p>Cortisol, a steroid hormone of the glucocorticoid family, is produced in the adre-
nal glands and released as the end product of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis (HPA-axis). Physical and psychological stress stimulates a hormonal cascade, 
wherein the hypothalamus secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which 
stimulates adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to be released from the anterior 
pituitary, which finally stimulates cortisol release (see Fig. 13.1). The primary func-
tion of cortisol is to mobilize glucose to fuel the &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; response to stress 
and enhance cardiovascular functioning (Sapolsky 1999). Cortisol also acts as a 
signal to inhibit further HPA-axis activity, forming a negative feedback loop that 
helps attenuate the stress response. Thus, cortisol release is a useful and adaptive 
response to stress in the short term that physiologically prepares the body for the 
rigors of reacting to a stressful experience.
</p>
<p>But overexposure to cortisol due to chronic stress disrupts the negative feedback 
loop, leading to cyclically increasing cortisol concentrations and a generally dys-
regulated physiological response to stress. Continual cortisol secretion reduces the 
quantity and efficacy of glucocorticoid receptors in the brain and along the HPA-ax-
is, resulting in an overall attenuation of glucocorticoid receptor activity in response 
to cortisol (Sapolsky et al. 1985; Cohen et al. 2012). This reduction in glucocor-
ticoid receptor activity leads to an inability to effectively suppress the endocrine 
stress response, resulting in sustained activation of the HPA-axis. In fact, when 
impairment of the negative feedback loop results in excess secretion, cortisol itself 
becomes a liability, with its deleterious effects including neural atrophy (Sapolsky 
1996), poor immune functioning (Cohen et al. 2012), and cardiovascular disease 
(Sapolsky 2004).
</p>
<p>Cortisol typically increases sharply each morning shortly after awakening&mdash;
termed the cortisol awakening response (CAR)&mdash;followed by a decline throughout 
the day&mdash;referred to as the diurnal cortisol slope (Fries et al. 2009). Chronic stress 
dysregulates this cycle, attenuating the awakening response and flattening the di-
urnal cortisol slope (Dowd et al. 2009; Miller et al. 2007). In summary, cortisol 
concentration rises in response to stressors and, if the stress is chronic, leads to </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>27513 Hormones and Hierarchies
</p>
<p>increasingly stronger cortisol responses to subsequent stressors as well as further 
exposure to cortisol through the dysregulation of the daily cycle of release. Cortisol 
is thus an integral part of the body&rsquo;s physiological reaction to stress exposure. Be-
low we review the evidence linking cortisol to status processes in humans.
</p>
<p>Correlational Evidence for a Status-Cortisol Link
</p>
<p>Basal Cortisol and Status Socioeconomic status, a broad measure of individual 
or familial wealth and education within society or a community (Adler and Ostrove 
1999), correlates negatively with basal cortisol concentrations in several human 
studies (Cohen et al. 2006a; Evans and English 2002; Evans and Kim 2007; Garcia

<p>et al. 2008; Li et al. 2007; Lupien et al. 2000; Steptoe et al. 2003; Kapuku et al. 
2002). This inverse relationship between status and basal cortisol has been found in 
other status-relevant domains as well. Leaders had lower-basal cortisol compared 
to nonleaders in a unique sample of military and business personnel (Sherman 
et al. 2012). The higher cortisol levels seen in lower-status individuals is typically 
attributed to cortisol dysregulation that results from exposure to increased quantity 
or severity of stressors inherent to low ranking within a status hierarchy (Sapol-
sky 2005). Alternatively, if low-status individuals are more frequently stressed, 
increased cortisol may simply represent more recent contact with an acute stressor 
(Gersten 2008).
</p>
<p>While these results illustrate that lower status is linked to high-basal cortisol, 
other studies examining basal cortisol concentrations and status found no relation-
ship (Goodman et al. 2005; Gersten 2008; Gadinger et al. 2011). But it may be that 
low-hierarchical rank is linked to the daily pattern of cortisol secretion, not just 
basal cortisol concentrations.
</p>
<p>Diurnal Cortisol Slope and Status Status does indeed relate to differential pat-
terns of daily cortisol secretion. As described above, healthy diurnal cortisol secre-
tion consists of the sharp, CAR-related increase in cortisol concentration followed 
by the day-long decline measured by the diurnal cortisol slope (Fries et al. 2009). In 
several studies, the diurnal cortisol slope appears flattened in lower SES individu-
als compared to higher-SES individuals (Agbedia et al. 2011; Kumari et al. 2010; 
Li et al. 2007; Ranjit et al. 2005; Do et al. 2011; Hajat et al. 2010). Following the 
cortisol awakening response, low SES individuals&rsquo; cortisol concentrations decline 
at a slower rate throughout the day, which may result in greater exposure to corti-
sol. Chronic stress is thought to lead to this abnormal diurnal cortisol pattern, but 
an exact psychosocial mechanism linking status, stress, and cortisol is still under 
investigation (discussed below).
</p>
<p>Mere dysregulation of the HPA-axis is not the end of the potentially detrimental 
consequences of low status. Abnormal diurnal cortisol patterns have been studied as 
contributing to several pathologies that occur at higher rates among low-SES indi-
viduals, including high blood pressure (Phillips et al. 2000), strokes, cardiovascular 
disease, and Type 2 diabetes (Rosmond and Bj&ouml;rntorp 2000a). Flatter diurnal cor-
tisol slopes are also associated with increased all-cause mortality, especially due to 
cardiovascular disease (Kumari et al. 2011), and with earlier mortality due to breast 
cancer (Sephton et al. 2000).
</p>
<p>Cortisol Reactivity and Status The previous work implicates low status in high-
basal cortisol and blunted cortisol rhythms throughout the day. Some evidence also 
links low status to cortisol increases in response to acute physical and psychosocial 
stress. Lower-SES individuals show a greater rise in cortisol in response to labora-
tory psychosocial stressors than high-SES individuals (Fiocco et al. 2007; Kristenson 
et al. 1998; Adler et al. 2000). In another study low-SES individuals showed cortisol 
hyperactivity compared to high-SES individuals following a pharmacological chal-
lenge of HPA-axis functioning (Rosmond and Bj&ouml;rntorp 2000b). In response to a 
dexamethasone suppression test&mdash;a test of the ability of the HPA-axis to suppress </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27713 Hormones and Hierarchies
</p>
<p>cortisol secretion in response to dexamethasone, a cortisol agonist&mdash;low-SES indi-
viduals did not reduce cortisol concentrations as effectively as high-SES individu-
als (Rosmond and Bj&ouml;rntorp 2000b). Taken together, these studies suggest that a 
given stressor will result in stronger activation of the HPA-axis and a slower return 
to baseline for a low-status individual. Repeated over the course of a day or life, 
this augmented reaction and prolonged recovery will expose the individual to more 
cortisol and to the concomitant negative effects of cortisol.
</p>
<p>Mediators of the Status-Cortisol Link
</p>
<p>The body of research reviewed above suggests that status is negatively related to 
cortisol concentrations in humans as measured in basal concentration, diurnal pat-
terns, and acute fluctuations of cortisol concentration. Several variables have been 
proposed as putative mechanisms of this relationship, of which we will review four: 
Health behaviors, sense of control, hostility, and social support.
</p>
<p>Health Behaviors Health behaviors have been investigated as an explanation for 
the relationship between status and cortisol, specifically within the context of SES. 
Several health behaviors were found to explain the relationship between measures 
of cortisol dysregulation and SES, including increased alcohol and tobacco use 
(Cohen et al. 2006a, b). Tobacco directly stimulates cortisol secretion in the short-
term and increases basal cortisol concentrations in current smokers compared to 
ex- and non-smokers (Badrick et al. 2007). Alcohol use also raises basal cortisol 
concentrations (Thayer et al. 2006; Bernardy et al. 1996).
</p>
<p>The psychological relationship between alcohol/tobacco use and status is less 
well understood. These behaviors exist at higher rates in low-SES environments, 
but it is unclear whether they are a response to or product of the environment, 
or some combination of both (Krueger and Chang 2008). Increased alcohol and 
tobacco use may reflect stress-induced derailment of impulse control or self-regu-
latory processes (Muraven and Baumeister 2000; Hull and Slone 2004). Or perhaps 
alcohol and tobacco consumption reflect a coping mechanism for dealing with low-
SES stress, as both products are believed (by the users) to relieve tension and im-
prove negative affect (Pampel et al. 2010; Hull and Slone 2004). Alternatively, the 
increased usage could result from environmental cultural norms, lower-education 
levels, or simply having less reason to invest in the future (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 
2008; Pampel et al. 2010).
</p>
<p>Sense of Control In stressful situations, lacking control over the stressor is known 
to produce substantial increases in cortisol compared to stressors that are directly 
controlled or predictable by an individual (Dickerson and Kemeny 2004). Being in 
a position at the top of a hierarchy lends itself to being or feeling in control, even 
over variables one could not possibly control such as the outcome of a roll of a die 
(Fast et al. 2009). So when a stressor is experienced by a high-status individual, she 
may be more likely to feel in control or actually be in control of that stressor, which </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>278 E. L. Knight and P. H. Mehta
</p>
<p>in turn attenuates the cortisol response. Consistent with this idea, self-reported sense 
of control accounts for the attenuating effect of status on cortisol when measured 
broadly as control over life circumstances and outcomes (Cohen et al. 2006b) and 
as interpersonal control over subordinates (Sherman et al. 2012). Indeed, instilling 
a sense of control has been suggested as an intervention for combating the negative 
effects of low SES. The &ldquo;shift and persist&rdquo; intervention proposes to improve stress 
coping of low-SES individuals by shifting attention toward what can be controlled 
within a stressful situation (Chen and Miller 2012). Redirecting attention to maxi-
mize one&rsquo;s sense of control may reduce the stress response, minimizing exposure 
to cortisol and the negative effects associated with increased cortisol concentra-
tion. The &ldquo;persist&rdquo; half of the proposed intervention relates to maintaining optimism 
and resiliency in the face of life&rsquo;s stressors. These traits have been found to pre-
dict lower-basal cortisol in individuals, even at lower SES (Lindfors and Lundberg 
2002; Ryff et al. 2004).
</p>
<p>Hostility Hostility is defined as an individual&rsquo;s proneness to anger and aggressive 
behavior based on a distrustful view of others (Kubzansky et al. 1999). Hostility is 
negatively related to SES, likely as a response to the difficult circumstances inher-
ent to being at the bottom of a hierarchy (Elovainio et al. 2001). Hostile individuals 
tend to respond antisocially to stressors, which in turn begets further interpersonal 
hostility (Smith 1994; Gallo et al. 2006). Hostility may underlie the cyclic and detri-
mental nature of stress and low status: Continual stress may lead to the development 
of a hostile nature that in turn invites additional provocation from others, becom-
ing an added stressor in itself. High-trait hostility also affects HPA-axis function, 
associating with increased daytime cortisol secretion and flattened cortisol slope 
(Pope and Smith 1991; Ranjit et al. 2009). Yet, while hostility has not been found 
to explain the relationship between SES and cortisol specifically, it does account 
for the relationship between SES and a summative measure of stress physiology, 
referred to as allostatic load, which incorporates cortisol as one of several physi-
ological markers of stress (Hawkley et al. 2011; Kubzansky et al. 1999). Hostility 
explains the physiological repercussions of low-status stress, but more research is 
necessary to clarify if hostility relates directly to cortisol functioning or only to 
broader stress physiology.
</p>
<p>Social Support The social networks of nonhuman primates provide several routes 
for high-status members of the hierarchy to cope with encountered stressors, for 
example, by being groomed by or aggressing toward subordinates (Sapolsky 2005). 
Likewise, humans generally benefit from social support, which has been shown to 
relate to lower-basal cortisol concentrations (Pinquart and S&ouml;rensen 2000; Uchino 
2006; Taylor et al. 2000) and to reduce the cortisol response to acute laboratory 
stressors (Heinrichs et al. 2003). Unreliable social networks and perceptions of 
social isolation meanwhile are stressors in themselves (Uchino 2006; Hawkley et al. 
2012).
</p>
<p>Since one&rsquo;s status is dependent on the opinions of others, having high status 
may provide more social capital to buffer one&rsquo;s stress response, while low status 
may not provide as rich of social networks on which to rely. Accordingly, low SES </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27913 Hormones and Hierarchies
</p>
<p> correlates with weaker social connections and less diverse social networks, which 
then accounts for increased cortisol concentration (Cohen et al. 2006a, b). The rea-
sons for this negative relationship between SES and social support may stem from 
distrusting one&rsquo;s neighbors in low-income neighborhoods (Subramanian et al. 2003; 
Brehm and Rahn 1997) or from an inability to provide or seek support due to the 
chronic stressors inherent to low SES (Cattell 2001). Future work that elucidates the 
exact aspect of social support that mediates this relationship could provide targets to 
ameliorate some of the negative consequences of low SES.
</p>
<p>Experimental Evidence for Status-Cortisol Link
</p>
<p>The reviewed work indicates that status correlates negatively with cortisol in natu-
ralistic studies, but the correlational nature of the evidence prohibits making causal 
statements of the direction of the effect for cortisol and status in human hierarchies. 
Although few experiments have focused on cortisol and status, recent work has 
begun to investigate causal explanations of the relationship between status and cor-
tisol.
</p>
<p>Status Causally Alters Cortisol Low status causally dysregulates HPA-axis activ-
ity in experimentally manipulated status hierarchies of nonhuman primates and 
other social animals, with results suggesting lower status leads to increased cortisol 
concentrations. In female rhesus macaques, subordination disrupts normal HPA-
axis functioning, decreasing the cortisol awakening response and prolonging cor-
tisol release following a stressor (Michopoulos et al. 2012). The relentless stress 
of low status causes diurnal and acute cortisol dysregulation in the lower-ranking 
macaques, an effect that has been found in experiments with several other species 
of social animals (cynomolgus monkeys: Jayo et al. 1993; mice: Avitsur et al. 2001; 
domestic pigs: Mendl et al. 1992; zebrafish: Filby et al. 2010).
</p>
<p>While status appears to alter cortisol activity in the species of various social ani-
mals, this experimental hypothesis has not been extensively tested in humans. The 
few studies that have experimentally tested the effects of status in humans show that 
status inversely affects cortisol concentrations, similar to the results seen in longitu-
dinal and cross-sectional studies. Cortisol increased following social stressors when 
low status was randomly assigned in an experimental hierarchy, while cortisol re-
activity was attenuated when high status was assigned (Carney et al. under review). 
A separate study found that adopting postures typically associated with nonverbal 
displays of high and low rank in a hierarchy affected cortisol concentrations. The 
so-called &ldquo;power positions&rdquo;&mdash;which include an open, expansive posture for high 
rank and a diminutive posture for low rank&mdash;decreased cortisol for high-rank body 
postures and increased cortisol for low-rank postures (Carney et al. 2010). This 
evidence indicates that experimental manipulations of social rank in a hierarchy 
affect cortisol concentration and cortisol reactivity to stressors in humans. In addi-
tion to long-term effects on the HPA-axis, social status seems to have immediate 
consequences for cortisol functioning.</p>

<p>280 E. L. Knight and P. H. Mehta
</p>
<p>Cortisol Causally Alters Status While this experimental research indicates that 
status causally influences cortisol concentrations, some evidence suggests the 
reciprocal relationship may be true as well. Animal studies have shown that gluco-
corticoids affect the formation of hierarchies as part of dominance contests. Admin-
istering corticosterone (the rodent analog to cortisol) to subordinate rats following 
defeat in a social interaction improves the memory for and maintenance of the hier-
archy (Timmer and Sandi 2010). In a study on rainbow trout, cortisol implanted 
under the animals&rsquo; skin affected the results of competitive interactions with similar-
sized fish and smaller conspecifics (DiBattista et al. 2005). Compared to a con-
trol condition, cortisol significantly decreased the likelihood of the treated trout to 
become the dominant fish in both the similar- and smaller-sized pairing. This lim-
ited evidence from animal research suggests that glucocorticoids may affect both 
the establishment of and memory for a status hierarchy through dominance con-
tests. These results have not been tested in humans per se (who are unable to hold 
their breath long enough to replicate these results), but cortisol may affect psycho-
logical variables relevant to hierarchical behavior. For example, cortisol disrupts 
social approach and avoidance behaviors (Roelofs et al. 2005; van Peer et al. 2007), 
which are theoretically important to earn and maintain status (Anderson and Ber-
dahl 2002). An exact role for cortisol in causally determining status within human 
hierarchies awaits future experimental research.
</p>
<p>Cortisol Responses to Competition
</p>
<p>Research on SES and status often studies status within static hierarchies, but the 
negative relationship between status and cortisol is found when the stepwise prog-
ress of obtaining high or low status in competitive settings is examined as well. As 
reviewed in the T section above, a dynamic model of status is found in naturalistic 
dominance contests like sporting events, laboratory competition, and political elec-
tions. Correlational studies of competitions show that gaining or maintaining status 
by winning a competition or supporting the winning side of a competition is associ-
ated with a drop in cortisol, while losing a competition or supporting the losing side 
is associated with a rise in cortisol (Stanton et al. 2010; Jimenez et al. 2012; Bateup 
et al. 2002).
</p>
<p>Yet several studies have found a null relationship between competition outcome 
and cortisol (e.g., Oliveira et al. 2009), or even increased cortisol after winning 
(Suay et al. 1999). The inconsistent nature of this association suggests that fac-
tors other than competition outcome play a role in determining the relationship 
between dynamic changes in status in competition and cortisol. Similar to the re-
search reviewed earlier on testosterone (Schultheiss et al. 2005), implicit power 
motive&mdash;a measure of a person&rsquo;s unconscious motivation to dominate others&mdash;is 
linked to cortisol responses to victory and defeat (Wirth et al. 2006). Individuals 
high in implicit power motive experienced rises in cortisol after losing a dominance 
contest and drops in cortisol after winning, whereas those low in implicit power </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28113 Hormones and Hierarchies
</p>
<p>motive showed the opposite pattern of cortisol changes (Wirth et al. 2006). These 
findings suggest that being relegated to low-status positions (losing a competition) 
may cause cortisol to increase only for those individuals motivated to achieve high 
status (individuals high in power motive). For those individuals who do not desire 
high-status positions (individuals low in power motive), achieving high status may 
actually be stressful resulting in cortisol increases (Wirth et al. 2006). The role of 
individual differences and social factors in moderating the relationship between 
status and cortisol is an important topic for future research, a point we expand upon 
toward the end of the chapter.
</p>
<p>The Dual-Hormone Hypothesis: Testosterone &times; Cortisol 
</p>
<p>Interactions and Status
</p>
<p>Social endocrinology research&mdash;and this chapter, so far&mdash;typically examines in-
dependent effects of hormones on behavior. While this approach has been fruitful 
for identifying some hormone-behavior relationships relevant to status, it may also 
contribute to inconsistent findings. For example, many studies find null associations 
between testosterone and status-related behaviors such as aggression (Archer 1998), 
and other studies find null associations between cortisol and status (Gadinger et al. 
2011). These inconsistencies may arise because testosterone and cortisol may work 
interactively&mdash;not independently&mdash;to affect social behaviors linked to status. Ac-
cording to the dual-hormone hypothesis (Mehta and Josephs 2010), testosterone and 
cortisol should jointly regulate behavior such that testosterone should be positively 
related to status-seeking behaviors&mdash;and in turn, higher status&mdash;only when cortisol 
concentrations are low (Mehta and Josephs 2010). When cortisol concentrations are 
high, testosterone&rsquo;s effect on status-seeking behaviors should be blocked. A series 
of recent studies provide strong empirical support for the dual-hormone hypothesis 
(Edwards and Casto 2013; Mehta and Josephs 2010; Popma et al. 2007). For ex-
ample, one study collected afternoon saliva samples to measure basal testosterone 
and cortisol and then videotaped participants in a position of leadership (Study 1, 
Mehta and Josephs 2010). Seven judges rated the leaders on nineteen social behav-
iors linked to dominance (e.g., engaged, gave clear instructions, directive, leader-
like, confident, nervous, uncomfortable). All nineteen behaviors were aggregated 
to create an overall dominance factor (items such as nervous and uncomfortable 
were reverse scored prior to aggregation). As shown in Fig. 13.2a, dual-hormone 
profiles of T and C interactively predicted dominant leadership behaviors. Basal T 
was positively related to dominance only among leaders low in basal C (Fig. 13.2a, 
solid line), but basal T was unrelated to dominance among leaders high in basal C 
(Fig. 13.2a, striped line).
</p>
<p>Social dominance is a key behavioral route to attaining high status across spe-
cies (Anderson and Kilduff 2009b; Mazur and Booth 1998). Thus, the dual-hor-
mone interaction may not only be related to dominant behaviors, but also to who 
attains high status. Two recent studies linked the testosterone-cortisol interaction </p>

<p>to social  status. Edwards and Casto (2013) measured basal hormone levels in ap-
</p>
<p>proximately 90 female collegiate female athletes (on soccer, softball, volleyball, 
</p>
<p>and tennis teams) and collected measures of status within their teams. As shown 
</p>
<p>in Fig. 13.2b, there was a dual-hormone interaction that closely matched Mehta 
</p>
<p>and Josephs (2010). Higher testosterone was positively related to social status only 
</p>
<p>among athletes low in basal cortisol (Fig. 13.2b, solid line), but basal testosterone 
</p>
<p>and status were unrelated among athletes high in basal cortisol (Fig. 13.2b, striped 
</p>
<p>line). A third study measured dual-hormone profiles, dominance, and status in MBA 
</p>
<p>students at an elite business school. Students provided afternoon saliva samples 
</p>
<p>and were randomly assigned to small work groups several weeks later (Mehta et al. 
</p>
<p>2013). The groups were videotaped performing a group decision-making task. At 
</p>
<p>the end of the task, all participants ranked their fellow group members on leader-
</p>
<p>ship. These leadership rankings were aggregated to create an overall measure of 
</p>
<p>status. Research assistants watched the videos and coded for dominant behaviors. 
</p>
<p>Consistent with Mehta and Josephs (2010) and Edwards and Casto (2013), the tes-
</p>
<p>tosterone-cortisol interaction predicted leadership rank (Fig. 13.2c) and dominant 
</p>
<p>behaviors. Moreover, dominance partially mediated the association between the 
</p>
<p>dual-hormone interaction and leadership rank. Overall, these studies demonstrate 
</p>
<p>that the testosterone-cortisol interaction predicts the attainment of status through 
</p>
<p>dominant behaviors. Higher testosterone is positively related to social dominance 
</p>
<p>and in turn higher status only among individuals with low cortisol, but testosterone 
</p>
<p>is unrelated to social dominance or status among individuals with high cortisol.
</p>
<p>The underlying physiological mechanisms for dual-hormone effects on behav-
</p>
<p>ior remain unknown. Mehta and Josephs (2010) speculate that these dual-hormone 
</p>
<p>interactions may occur through an inhibitory effect of cortisol on the pathway be-
</p>
<p>tween testosterone and behavior. When cortisol is low, the pathway between tes-
</p>
<p>tosterone and behavior functions efficiently, and higher testosterone should have a 
</p>
<p>strong effect on behaviors such as dominance. When cortisol is high, the pathway 
</p>
<p>between testosterone and behavior may be blocked (e.g., by down-regulating andro-
</p>
<p>gen receptors, cf. Mehta and Josephs 2010). Testosterone and cortisol may also in-
</p>
<p>teract on a psychological level given testosterone&rsquo;s association with status-seeking 
</p>
<p>motivation and cortisol&rsquo;s association with social approach-inhibition. A combina-
</p>
<p>tion of high status-seeking motivation (high testosterone) and social approach (low 
</p>
<p>cortisol) may lead to social dominance and higher status, whereas a combination of 
</p>
<p>high status-seeking motivation (high testosterone) and social inhibition (high corti-
</p>
<p>sol) may cause submissive behaviors and lower status. These mechanisms fit within 
</p>
<p>a broader evolutionary approach to understanding the roles of the stress (HPA) and 
</p>
<p>reproductive (HPG) axes in modulating complex social behavior (Carr&eacute; and Mehta 
</p>
<p>2011). High environmental stress (high cortisol) may inhibit the effect of testoster-
</p>
<p>one on reproductively relevant behaviors such as competitive behavior and domi-
</p>
<p>nance, because such behaviors are metabolically costly and potentially dangerous. 
</p>
<p>Only when environmental stress is low (low cortisol) might behaviors relevant to 
</p>
<p>the pursuit of status be expressed. Nevertheless, these proposed mechanisms are 
</p>
<p>highly speculative and lack direct empirical support. Delineating the precise path-
</p>
<p>ways that give rise to testosterone-cortisol interactions awaits further research.</p>

</p>
<p>Estradiol
</p>
<p>Estradiol is the most prevalent and potent molecule of the class of steroid hormones 
known as estrogens, which are typically thought of as the female sex hormones (Mc-
Carthy 2008; Stanton and Edelstein 2009). The set of biochemical reactions neces-
sary to produce estradiol is complex: Estradiol starts as a molecule of cholesterol, 
the precursor to all steroid hormones, which is then converted to a glucocorticoid. 
An androgen molecule is produced next before it is finally converted to estradiol. 
This process occurs primarily in the ovarian granulosa cells of human and nonhu-
man females, as well as in the adrenal cortices in females and males (McCarthy 
2008). Stimulation of estradiol secretion, like testosterone, is the end product of a 
cascade of hormones from the HPG-axis and mainly relates to female reproductive 
processes. As part of the menstrual cycle, the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-re-
leasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and follicle-stimulating hormone 
(FSH) from the pituitary stimulates a surge of estradiol. When this rapid increase on 
estradiol reaches a certain threshold, estradiol increases luteinizing hormone (LH) 
secretion from the pituitary, which in turn induces ovulation (Plant 2012). Sustained 
increases of estradiol during puberty are responsible for the development of female 
secondary sex characteristics and for skeletal growth in males and females (Rogol 
et al. 2002). Placental tissue also secretes estradiol, which contributes to maintain-
ing pregnancies (Albrecht et al. 2000).
</p>
<p>While testosterone relates to concern for status in men and women, the role of 
T in female status-relevant behavior is tenuous (Mazur and Booth 1998). But this 
may be due to the important role estradiol, and not testosterone, plays in fertility and 
reproductive behavior in women such that estradiol underlies female status-seeking 
and dominant behavior (Stanton and Schultheiss 2009; Schultheiss 2007). An evo-
lutionary perspective suggests that during the fertile period of the menstrual cycle, 
gaining a high-status position might improve fitness since high status would garner 
access to benefits like the best mates, most food, and social support (c.f. Stanton 
and Edelstein 2009). Thus, because ovulation is induced by a surge of estradiol, this 
hormone may promote competitive or dominant behaviors in females in response to 
the advantages high status holds for fertile females.
</p>
<p>In line with this theory, early research on female chimpanzees has shown that 
administering estradiol enhances status by increasing dominant behavior within a 
small, female hierarchy (Birch and Clark 1946). In humans, higher-basal estradiol 
concentrations relate to higher measures of implicit dominance motives, an indi-
cation of a preference for power and higher ranking in hierarchies (Stanton and 
Schultheiss 2007; Stanton and Edelstein 2009). In fact, as further evidence of the 
evolutionary link between estradiol and status, the relationship between estradiol 
and implicit dominance is stronger in single women than women in romantic rela-
tionships (Schultheiss et al. 2003; Stanton and Schultheiss 2007; Stanton and Edel-
stein 2009). Lacking a sexual partner, single women theoretically have a greater 
incentive to compete for status in response to the endocrine signal of ovulation 
and consequently show a stronger correlational relationship between estradiol and 
implicit dominance.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28513 Hormones and Hierarchies
</p>
<p>Changes in estradiol concentration are also associated with dominance and status 
in laboratory studies, much like men&rsquo;s testosterone fluctuations in competition. In 
women who scored high on implicit dominance, winning a competition was as-
sociated with an influx of estradiol while losing resulted in diminished estradiol 
concentration (Stanton and Schultheiss 2007; Stanton and Edelstein 2009). Women 
low in implicit dominance did not show this pattern of estradiol response. Estradiol 
thus relates to an implicit drive for dominance and status in females and responds to 
changes in status for individuals with high implicit dominance.
</p>
<p>Some evidence suggests that the effects of estradiol on status are only found 
in interfemale competition. Theoretically, female primates in the fertile phase of 
their menstrual cycle are only in competition with other females for status and 
mates; males are competed over, not usually competitors in this regard. Estradiol 
then may only augment female dominance or status in same-sex hierarchies. The 
literature cited above all relied on female-female hierarchies and competitions but 
did not test for effects of competitor gender. One recent study supports the concept 
that estradiol specifically alters female-female competition by demonstrating that 
women with high-estradiol levels are more competitive in negotiations with other 
women, but not men (Severance 2011). Future work should continue to explore 
the role of estradiol in competition while examining social moderators like com-
petitor gender.
</p>
<p>Oxytocin
</p>
<p>Oxytocin is a neuropeptide hormone produced in the hypothalamus and secreted 
from the posterior pituitary that has recently received significant attention as a neu-
roendocrine modulator of social behavior and social cognition (Bartz et al. 2011). 
Early work with the hormone showed its importance in peripheral physiology, es-
pecially in regards to maternal processes and parturition. For example, oxytocin 
produces uterine and cervical contractions, stimulates the milk let-down reflex in 
the mammary glands, and is used clinically to induce labor (Salonia et al. 2005; 
Bethlehem et al. 2013). In animal studies, oxytocin additionally induces maternal 
behaviors like maternal care in rodents and maternal bonding in sheep which, when 
coordinated with the oxytocin-induced maternal physiology, aid in the survival of 
offspring (Ross and Young 2009). Human oxytocin similarly relates to parental be-
haviors, with plasma and saliva concentrations predictive of postpartum, parent-
child bonding, attachment, and infant monitoring (Feldman et al. 2007, 2010, 2011; 
Galbally et al. 2011). Oxytocin also positively relates to levels of bonding and inter-
personal attraction in romantic relationships (Grewen et al. 2005; Tops et al. 2007), 
though some work indicates that oxytocin may actually signal relationship distress 
and a concomitant desire for more social contact (Turner et al. 1999; Taylor et al. 
2006).
</p>
<p>While oxytocin alters peripheral physiology and seems to relate to parental and 
interpersonal bonding in humans, associating peripheral oxytocin concentration to </p>

</p>
<p>social behavior remains controversial. The oxytocin molecule does not readily pass 
through the blood-brain barrier, the restrictive capillary anatomy that prevents cer-
tain molecules from entering the extracellular space of the central nervous system 
(Churchland and Winkeilman 2012). Unlike other hormones reviewed in this chap-
ter, oxytocin secreted from the pituitary does not diffuse into the central nervous 
system, and thus peripheral basal concentration (i.e., measured in saliva or blood) 
does not correlate with cerebral spinal fluid concentrations (Kagerbauer et al. 2013). 
Instead, oxytocin is released into the central nervous system from neurons that proj-
ect from the hypothalamus to limbic and other neural regions at concentrations that 
are distinct from peripheral levels (Bethlehem et al. 2013; Ross and Young 2009; 
Bartz et al. 2011; Fig. 13.3).
</p>
<p>Oxytocin and Intergroup Status
</p>
<p>Research on the prosocial effects of oxytocin in humans has accelerated in the past 
decade due to the development of an inhalable form of the hormone (Bartz et al. 
2011). Intranasal administration of oxytocin deposits the hormone directly in the 
</p>
<p>Fig. 13.3  Oxytocin is produced in the hypothalamus. Neural projections release oxytocin to lim-
bic regions and other areas of the brain. Oxytocin is also released into the pituitary, where it is then 
secreted into the peripheral blood stream and carried to the rest of the body (Bethlehem et al. 2013)

</p>
<p>cerebrospinal fluid where it can alter central neural physiology (Born et al. 2002). 
Initial work pointed to oxytocin directly increasing prosocial behaviors, earning 
oxytocin the monikers &ldquo;love drug&rdquo; and &ldquo;cuddle chemical&rdquo; (de Dreu 2012; Bartz 
et al. 2011). Broadly, oxytocin increases trust, generosity, and cooperation in eco-
nomic decision-making games (Kosfeld et al. 2005; Zak et al. 2007) and increases 
interpersonal perceptions of trustworthiness and attractiveness (Zak et al. 2005; 
Theodoridou et al. 2009). Exogenous oxytocin also affects social cognition, im-
proving memory for positively valenced faces (Guastella et al. 2008; Rimmele et al. 
2009; Marsh et al. 2010) and improving empathic accuracy when the task is difficult 
(Bartz et al. 2011).
</p>
<p>Yet, when examined in a social context, oxytocin appears to only promote pro-
social behaviors directed toward in-group members (de Dreu 2012). So rather than 
affecting an individual&rsquo;s status like testosterone or estradiol, oxytocin affects be-
haviors related to improving the status of one&rsquo;s in-group. For example, oxytocin 
increased the likelihood for men to self-sacrifice economically for the benefit of an 
experimentally assigned in-group in a competition (de Dreu et al. 2010), especially 
when an in-group member is perceived to be threatened or vulnerable (de Dreu et al. 
2012b). The men given oxytocin also reported a higher level of trust that their in-
group members would reciprocate the self-sacrificial behavior, but did not exhibit 
an increase in distrust in or derogatory behavior toward the out-group.
</p>
<p>The costly, prosocial behaviors found in these studies may signal an individual&rsquo;s 
unselfishness, generosity, and resource wealth to the other members of the group, 
who may then confer greater status to the altruistic individual (Hardy and Van Vugt 
2006; Willer 2009). For example, donators to a public fund were rated as having 
higher status compared to nondonators and, in a second experiment, individuals who 
donated to in-groups but not competing out-groups were granted higher status than 
individuals who donated equally to in-groups and out-groups (Halevy et al. 2012). 
So while oxytocin-altered, altruistic behaviors directed toward in-group members 
(e.g., De Dreu et al. 2010) may result in individual status gains, the direct relation-
ship between oxytocin and individual status has not yet been experimentally tested.
</p>
<p>Exogenous oxytocin also affects unconscious cognitive processes that alter 
moral decisions and promote positive associations with the in-group. Oxytocin de-
creased the likelihood to sacrifice a member of a cultural in-group to save an un-
named group of individuals from impending doom (e.g., a runaway trolley in the 
moral choice dilemma problems; de Dreu et al. 2011). After administering oxytocin, 
men also responded more quickly to stimuli that paired in-group members&rsquo; names 
with positively valenced words on the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald 
et al. 2009) and more slowly to out-group members&rsquo; names as an implicit sign of 
preference for in-group members and disdain for out-group members, respectively 
(de Dreu et al. 2011). All together, these exogenous administration studies demon-
strate oxytocin&rsquo;s influence on behaviors and psychology that benefit the in-group in 
competitive and noncompetitive settings, which result in promoting an in-group&rsquo;s 
status over an out-group.
</p>
<p>Oxytocin also improves group dynamics, specifically altering behavior related to 
the process of forming a group and to cohesiveness within a group. When picking </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>288 E. L. Knight and P. H. Mehta
</p>
<p>teams, for example, dominant-looking individuals may prove more useful on one&rsquo;s 
own team rather than on an opposing team. Accordingly, oxytocin increases the 
preference for alliances with men with threatening, dominant facial features as op-
posed to less threatening, trustful features in an intergroup competition (De Dreu 
et al. 2012a). And once a team is formed, cohesion among a group&rsquo;s members is 
an important predictor of the performance of the group (Evans and Dion 1991). 
Oxytocin improves this aspect of in-group functioning as well, biasing subjective 
judgments towards agreement with the in-group and disagreement with the out-
group (Stallen et al. 2012). When in-group and out-group members&rsquo; ratings of the 
attractiveness of inanimate objects were at odds, males given oxytocin more often 
conformed to in-group ratings, an effect not seen in participants given placebo.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the effects of oxytocin on group-level status do not depend on the 
extent of the differences between in-group and out-group or on the inherent impor-
tance of the in-group to an individual. Instead, oxytocin stimulates these prosocial, 
in-group behaviors across a variety of in- and out-groups. De Dreu et al. (2011) 
showed that oxytocin produced prosocial effects directed towards the in-group 
when the out-group was defined in terms of two different cultural out-groups (i.e., 
names of German or undefined Arabic descent for Dutch participants). Oxytocin 
even bolstered in-group status in arbitrarily defined, experimental groups that do 
not contain implicit cultural importance (Stallen et al. 2012; de Dreu et al. 2010, 
2012a, b). In light of these findings, oxytocin seems to amplify in-group bias in 
minimal groups (Tajfel 1982), meaning that any grouping&mdash;experimentally or cul-
turally defined&mdash;is enough for oxytocin to affect the promotion of the in-group&rsquo;s 
status over the out-group.
</p>
<p>In sum, elevated levels of oxytocin seem to promote group-level status by in-
creasing altruistic, protective behaviors toward an in-group and positive cognitive 
associations and decisions with in-group members. One caveat from this literature 
is the dependence on male participants in these intranasal oxytocin administration 
experiments. Safety concerns for women (e.g., the potential to induce labor) and 
the degree to which oxytocin concentration fluctuates during the menstrual cycle 
(Salonia et al. 2005) make males a convenient sample to study. Yet a recent study 
suggests exogenous oxytocin differentially affects males and females. Intranasal 
oxytocin improves the ability to label ambiguous social interactions but this effect 
was only true for women viewing kinship interactions and for men viewing com-
petitive interactions (Fischer-Softy et al. 2013). Future research must determine if 
similar effects on group-level status emerge in women given oxytocin, or if these 
effects are only found in males.
</p>
<p>Effects of Status on Oxytocin
</p>
<p>Little work has focused on the effects of status on endogenous oxytocin concentra-
tions due to the problems of inferring central effects from peripheral oxytocin and 
due to the safety concerns of measuring oxytocin in cerebrospinal fluid. But it is </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28913 Hormones and Hierarchies
</p>
<p>possible that oxytocin is generally increased in well-regarded, high-status individu-
als as they may experience more prosocial interactions and positive attention from 
lower-ranking members due to the esteem associated with high-status positions. 
Consistent with this idea, high status in experimentally determined, female rhesus 
macaque hierarchies boosts oxytocin concentration compared to low-status posi-
tions (Michopoulos et al. 2011). In this case, grooming and submissive behaviors 
directed toward the high-status members increased as a result of their position in 
the hierarchy, which in turn augmented oxytocin concentration for the high but not 
low-status members. Although work in humans has so far focused on the effects of 
oxytocin on group status, one&rsquo;s individual status may affect oxytocin concentra-
tions, especially within stable, decorous hierarchies.
</p>
<p>Future Directions
</p>
<p>Moving forward, research on the social endocrinology of status will benefit from 
considering the effects of social and biological moderators, neural mechanisms, 
health implications, other hormones, and greater attention to the diverse ways in 
which humans attain status. Considering these factors will produce a more compre-
hensive model of the influence of hormones within hierarchies.
</p>
<p>Social and Biological Moderators
</p>
<p>More work on social moderators within hierarchies will expand our understand-
ing of the biosocial mechanisms of status. For example, most work on humans 
has focused on the negative association between status and cortisol within stable 
status hierarchies where there is no potential to gain or lose status. But in unstable 
hierarchies, high-status individuals may fear losing their status (Jordan et al. 2011), 
undermining their sense of control and increasing their psychological stress. Low-
status individuals may hope for a better position in the hierarchy, and a &ldquo;nothing-
to-lose&rdquo; perspective may result in lower stress. Hence, cortisol and stress may be 
higher in high status compared to low-status individuals in unstable hierarchies. 
Evidence supports this possibility in animals (Sapolsky 2005), but the effects of 
hierarchical instability on endocrine function and status in humans remain unclear.
</p>
<p>Genes that affect hormone receptor and neurotransmitter function also present 
interesting avenues for future research on hormones and hierarchies. Testosterone 
influences social behaviors by binding to androgen receptors, implying that tes-
tosterone should have a stronger effect on status-relevant behaviors in individuals 
with heightened androgen receptor function. One study linked variability in the 
androgen receptor gene to status-seeking behaviors in men (i.e., self-reported domi-
nance and prestige; Simmons and Roney 2011). This study failed to find evidence 
for an interaction between the androgen receptor gene and basal testosterone levels, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>290 E. L. Knight and P. H. Mehta
</p>
<p>but the possibility remains that fluctuating levels of testosterone may interact with 
androgen receptor genes to influence social status. Other research shows that basal 
testosterone interacts with the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) to regulate 
status-related processes. Individuals with high testosterone showed a stronger cor-
tisol response to status-related stressors when these individuals were also carriers 
of the short allele of 5-HTTLPR (Josephs et al. 2012). Although untested, it is pos-
sible that this serotonergic gene by testosterone interaction may underlie behavioral 
responses to status threats as well.
</p>
<p>Neural Mechanisms
</p>
<p>Another aspect of the social endocrinology of status that needs further attention is 
the neural correlates of hormones and hierarchies. Studies utilizing hormones and 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have documented neural networks 
associated with testosterone (H&ouml;fer et al. 2013), oxytocin (Bethlehem et al. 2013), 
estradiol (Maki and Resnick 2001; Craig et al. 2008), and cortisol (Dedovic et al. 
2009; Lovallo et al. 2010) that may underlie the effects these hormones have on 
status-relevant behavior. While some studies have begun to elucidate neural net-
works important for the perception of status (Chiao et al. 2009; Zink et al. 2008), the 
next leap forward for social endocrinology is to isolate neural networks that explain 
the relationship between hormones and behaviors related to dominance and status-
seeking (e.g., reduced orbitofrontal cortex activity as a mediator of the association 
between testosterone and status-seeking behavior, Mehta and Beer 2010).
</p>
<p>Health
</p>
<p>Several decades of research have demonstrated that low status is associated with 
increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, Type-2 diabetes, 
and obesity (Li et al. 2007; Rosmond and Bj&ouml;rntorp 2000a), even in a continu-
ously employed sample with universal access to healthcare (Chandola and Marmot 
2010). Cortisol dysregulation has been implicated in leading to these poor health 
outcomes (Adler et al. 1994; Li et al. 2007), but future work should examine the 
causal relationships between acute stress, cortisol, and poor health outcomes inher-
ent to low status. Other hormones should be investigated as well. For example, 
oxytocin and polymorphisms in its receptor gene reduce the cortisol (Chen et al. 
2011) and cardiovascular (Norman et al. 2012) responses to stress. Thus, oxytocin 
could represent a pathway by which social connections alter health within a status 
hierarchy. Estradiol and testosterone are also thought to relate to cardiovascular 
health through subtle alterations of cardiovascular functioning (P&eacute;rez-L&oacute;pez et al. 
2010), though more research on these hormones is needed in the context of status 
hierarchies and health.</p>

<p>29113 Hormones and Hierarchies
</p>
<p>Vasopressin and other Hormones
</p>
<p>Arginine vasopressin, or just vasopressin, is a neuropeptide hormone that has at-
tracted attention as a potential modulator of status and dominant behavior in animal 
studies, but little is known about vasopressin&rsquo;s role in human social status. Like the 
molecularly similar hormone oxytocin, vasopressin improves social memory and 
cooperation (Benarroch 2013) but, unlike oxytocin, vasopressin augments the corti-
sol response to social stressors (Shalev et al. 2011). Additionally, the effects of tes-
tosterone on certain aspects of status may depend on an interaction with vasopres-
sin. Flank marking and territorial aggression in Syrian hamsters, both indicators of 
status, depend on interactions between testosterone and vasopressin concentrations 
(Koolhaas et al. 1990; Albers and Cooper 1995). In humans, testosterone&rsquo;s role in 
coordinating a response to status threat likely works through vasopressin-mediated 
neural pathways (Bos et al. 2012), though few human studies have examined va-
sopressin in this context. Future work should focus on the effects of vasopressin 
in human hierarchies, particularly in relation to its interaction with testosterone. 
Other steroid hormones such as dehydrepiandrosterone (DHEA, and its sulfate form 
DHEA-S) may also be involved in behaviors implicated in status, possibly by buff-
ering emotional responses to social stressors (Akinola and Mendes 2008).
</p>
<p>Multiple Routes to Status
</p>
<p>Social endocrinology research has focused almost exclusively on dominance as a 
behavioral route to individual status attainment, but humans rise in social hierar-
chies not only through dominance but also through prosocial behaviors such as 
building social connections and sharing expertise (Anderson and Kilduff 2009b; 
Cheng et al. 2013). More research is needed on the social and neuroendocrine 
mechanisms for these other routes to status. Although some research suggests that 
testosterone suppresses cooperative behaviors (Mehta et al. 2009), a recent study 
showed that testosterone enhances prosociality in contexts in which such behav-
iors may be beneficial for status. Testosterone administration decreased prosocial 
behavior when there was a threat in the social environment (the threat of betrayal), 
but testosterone boosted prosocial behavior when there was no threat (a benevolent 
social interaction) (Boksem et al. 2013). The authors speculate that testosterone 
may have increased prosociality in the nonthreatening situation because building 
social connections may be more important than dominance for achieving status in 
this context. Oxytocin and progesterone are other candidate hormones that may help 
an individual gain status through affiliative behaviors (Bartz et al. 2011; Wirth and 
Schultheiss 2006), but no research to date has studied these hormones in the context 
of individual-based (as opposed to group-based) status hierarchies. Future research 
should continue to examine the biosocial mechanisms that regulate prosocial routes 
to gaining and maintaining status in human hierarchies.</p>

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>Social status hierarchy refers to social relations between individuals and groups 
of individuals that rely on a differential rank or social roles, such as dominant or 
high status and submissive or low-status roles that affect access to resources neces-
sary for survival (Fiske 1992; Sidanius and Pratto 2001). Across the animal king-
dom, individuals and groups who are high in social status are more likely to receive 
preferential access to or quantity of resources, compared to those who are low in 
social status. Social status may refer to both situational and dispositional attributes 
of people and groups. For instance, African cichlid fish when in a high dominance 
or territorial social role, typically display phenotypic features, such as larger gonad 
size, that resembles masculinity, whereas those in a submissive or low territorial 
social role, show phenotypic features, such as smaller gonad size, that resembles 
femininity (Fernald 2012). Moreover, people with high social dominance orienta-
tion (SDO) refer to a personality preference for hierarchical social relations, where-
as people with low social dominance orientation (SDO) prefer egalitarian social 
relations (Pratto et al. 1994; Sidanius and Pratto 2001). Groups, such as cultures 
and organizations, may similarly vary in preference for social status hierarchy, a 
cultural dimension known as power distance (Hofstede 2001). Cultures that are 
high in power distance expect or accept that social power will be distributed in a 
hierarchical fashion, whereas cultures low in power distance strive for social power 
to be distributed in an egalitarian fashion (Hofstede 2001).

<p>Hierarchical social relations refer to a core dimension of social relations that define 
groups and individuals. Both in historical and contemporary human society, the abil-
ity to gather or create resources necessary for survival, such as primary and secondary 
rewards (e.g., food, land, social reputation, currency, close social bonds, technology, 
knowledge), may vary depending on social hierarchy (Fiske 1992; Sidanius and Pratto 
2001). Stable social hierarchies typically refer to an expectation of social roles across 
individuals that refer to an unequal distribution of resources, depending on motivation 
or skill. High-status individuals may expect preferential access to increased quantity 
or quality of resources, and in return low-status individuals may expect parental care 
or to receive resources from those who are higher in social-status roles.
</p>
<p>The ability to recognize, maintain, and navigate social-status signals in the en-
vironment is often crucial for individual and group&rsquo;s survival. Without proper un-
derstanding of the social role expectations and rules for one&rsquo;s self and other group 
members, the rituals of obtaining and distributing necessary resources from the en-
vironment may become compromised. Due to the evolutionary significance of so-
cial dominance, detection of hierarchical social interactions emerges during infancy 
(Mascaro and Csibra 2012; Thomsen et al. 2011), with acquisition of psychological 
capacities and neurobiological structures for adhering to cultural and societal norms 
of social status occurring throughout childhood and adolescence (Hawley 1999). 
The development of the ability to regulate one&rsquo;s behavior is likely a crucial mile-
stone for social status cognition, as impulses and habits of the individual become 
more controlled, sensitized, and responsive to environmental or cultural demands. 
The physiological and psychological risks and benefits of occupying a low or high 
status within the group also change across development as neural circuitry neces-
sary for fulfilling social roles and social status abilities mature and subsequently 
decline in later life (Hackman et al. 2010; Noble and Farah 2013).
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we review interdisciplinary evidence for the neurobiological ba-
sis of social status hierarchy, primarily in humans. In the following sections, we 
provide a comprehensive overview of (a) neural systems of social status hierarchy, 
including those associated with stable and unstable hierarchies, (b) neurotransmitter 
systems of social status hierarchy, (c) gene-environment interaction of social status 
hierarchy, and (d) cultural neuroscience of social status hierarchy. In the final sec-
tion, we discuss the existing gaps in the literature and the implications of the neural 
basis of social status hierarchy for improving human health.

<p>Neural Encoding of Social Status Within Stable  
</p>
<p>and Unstable Hierarchies
</p>
<p>In order to appropriately process and react to hierarchical information surrounding 
others within a social hierarchy, neural systems must exist that distinguish between 
high and low-social ranks in both stable and unstable hierarchical settings. In stable </p>

</p>
<p>hierarchies, where hierarchy-related conflicts are minimal, social ranks are estab-
lished and unchanging. Alternatively, periods of hierarchical unrest resulting from 
fluctuation of group members or group conflict render the hierarchy unstable; and 
during this time, a subordinate can overtake the dominant position and vice versa. 
Generally, in primates, dominant individuals may recruit more neural resources 
than subordinates by virtue of being more significant determinants of behavior 
(Cummins 2000). Researchers have begun to identify particular brain regions that 
differentially respond to the relative high and low social status of individuals within 
stable and unstable hierarchy settings. In one such investigation (Zink et al. 2008), 
an experimental human social hierarchy was established based on incidental skill 
in the context of a simulated, interactive game with others. Under stable condi-
tions, the initial hierarchical ranks were static and unchanging, whereas an unstable 
condition was introduced by allowing social ranks to update based on performance 
(i.e., skill) throughout the game. By implementing this paradigm during functional 
MRI, Zink and colleagues determined four brain regions that preferentially activate 
when viewing someone of relatively higher compared to lower status in both stable 
and unstable hierarchies: parahippocampal cortex, occipitoparietal cortex, ventral 
striatum, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Each of these regions is involved in a distinct 
cognitive process which is influenced by social status, and is particularly engaged to 
a great extent during interactions with higher-rather than lower-ranked individuals.
</p>
<p>Recognition of others&rsquo; relative ranks within a hierarchy depends on one&rsquo;s ability 
to contextually encode the association between hierarchical status and the particular 
person to whom it pertains. The parahippocampal cortex is central to the media-
tion of contextual associations (Aminoff et al. 2007; Bar et al. 2008); in humans, 
its activity increases in response to faces that are highly associated with a context 
(e.g., famous faces) compared to faces that lack contextual association (Bar et al. 
2008). Within both stable and unstable interactive hierarchies, the human parahip-
pocampal cortex is preferentially activated by viewing a relatively superior indi-
vidual (Zink et al. 2008), suggesting that the neural processing of the contextual 
association between status and person is greater for high status compared to low-
status individuals.
</p>
<p>For primates, social information is most readily acquired via visual observation 
(Haude et al. 1976) and within a hierarchy, dominant animal demand the visual at-
tention of subordinate animals more so than vice versa (Chance 1967; Deaner et al. 
2005; Foulsham et al. 2010). Such increases in the attentional and/or perceptual 
processing of a dominant figure are likely driven by activation in the occipitopa-
rietal cortex (Bradley et al. 2003), a brain region preferentially engaged in human 
hierarchy when one is faced with someone of higher rank compared to lower rank 
(Zink et al. 2008). This is the case in nonhuman primates as well. Event-related 
potentials (ERPs), specifically the N2 ERP component, measured over occipital/
parietal sites are larger when monkeys view photographs of familiar dominant con-
specifics than when viewing corresponding low-status pictures (Pineda et al. 1994). 
Furthermore, intraparietal neurons increase firing when a monkey is presented with 
and makes the choice to view a dominant monkey (the preferred option) but only 
in the context of making a decision whether or not to orient to it (Klein et al. 2008). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>306 N. Pornpattananangkul et al.
</p>
<p>This suggests that rather than coding social value per se, lateral intraparietal neu-
rons may integrate value with the decision to orient, thus facilitating the direction of 
attention to important stimuli, such as those individuals with high status.
</p>
<p>While activity in the occipitoparietal cortex does not directly represent social 
value, the increased attention paid to those of higher rank likely corresponds with 
greater value placed on high-status primates. Top-ranked individuals in a hierarchy 
may be considered behaviorally aversive due to their threatening nature; however, 
they still carry more salience than low-ranked individuals by providing valuable 
information to guide behavior (Deaner et al. 2005; Klein et al. 2008). The social 
value associated with higher status is likely coded in the increased ventral striatal 
response that manifests when facing a higher-status individual compared to lower 
status within a human interactive hierarchy (Zink et al. 2008). Activity in the ven-
tral striatum has been strongly implicated in the processing of motivational value 
and salience, irrespective of hedonics (Blitzer et al. 2013; Jensen et al. 2006; Zink 
et al. 2003, 2006). This interpretation of the ventral striatal status-related response 
is supported behaviorally using a choice selection paradigm in monkeys. Monkeys 
prefer to gain access to higher status compared to low-status monkeys and are even 
willing to sacrifice getting a juice reward to do so (Deaner et al. 2005). Interest-
ingly, the preferential desire to view dominant monkeys is dependent on one&rsquo;s own 
social rank. While dominant monkeys favor viewing other high-ranked monkeys 
over low-ranked, subordinate monkeys will also attend to conspecifics of low status 
(Shepherd et al. 2006). Complimentary to these findings, in humans, one&rsquo;s socio-
economic status (SES) influences the ventral response to SES information about 
others. For people of high SES, the ventral striatum is preferentially activated by 
exposure to information regarding a high-status individual, which is not the case 
for people of low SES (in whom the ventral striatum is activated by information 
about low-status individuals) (Ly et al. 2011). The value placed on dominance in 
a hierarchy, and hence the striatal response to status information, is influenced by 
one&rsquo;s rank in a hierarchy.
</p>
<p>Much of the value surrounding dominant figures in primate hierarchies stems 
from their ability to guide advantageous behavior and promote social norm compli-
ance. Social norms that determine &ldquo;permitted, obligated, or prohibited&rdquo; behaviors 
are defined and maintained by hierarchies, and importantly, dominant individuals 
are typically responsible for punishing social norm violators. Activity in the dorso-
lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with the degree of social norm com-
pliance in the presence of an agent who can punish social norm violations (Spitzer 
et al. 2007), and DLPPC can possibly integrate contextual information and exert 
cognitive control over behavior via anatomical connections to the parahippocampal 
cortex (Bar et al. 2008; Goldman-Rakic et al. 1984) and motor system structures 
(Miller and Cohen 2001), respectively. The DLPFC is another brain region more ac-
tivate when interacting with a higher-ranked as opposed to lower-ranked individual 
in experimentally created human stable and unstable hierarchies (Zink et al. 2008). 
Therefore, the DLPFC possibly exerts greater cognitive control over behavior se-
lection in the context of interacting with a hierarchically superior person because 
of the pertinence of appropriate behavior in the presence of high-status individuals.</p>
<p/>

<p>30714 Neural Basis of Social Status Hierarchy
</p>
<p>Activity in the aforementioned brain regions (namely, parahippocampal cortex, 
occipitoparietal cortex, ventral striatum, and DLPFC) is preferentially heighten by 
exposure to a higher-rank individual compared to lower-ranked individual in both 
stable and unstable hierarchical settings. Differential social status-related activation 
in several other brain regions, however, occurs only during periods of hierarchical 
instability, when change in rank is possible. In the paradigm created by Zink et al. 
(2008), human hierarchical instability was induced by allowing relative ranks to re-
peatedly change according to performance. Specifically, viewing a person of partic-
ular status occurred just prior to playing a skill-based game with that individual, the 
outcome of which impacted future status rankings. Motor-related brain areas (sen-
sorimotor cortex and supplementary motor area [SMA]), medial prefrontal cortex 
(MPFC) and the amygdala were all more engaged when facing a person of higher 
status than a person of lower status in this unstable human hierarchy setting. Sen-
sorimotor cortex and SMA are not only activated by actual movement but also by 
imagined movement, indicative of involvement in motor preparation (Lotze et al. 
1999). Therefore, activation of these motor-related areas evoked by viewing a su-
perior individual may represent an increase in motor preparation driven by greater 
behavioral motivation when interacting with someone of higher status as opposed to 
lower status in an unstable hierarchy. The MPFC plays a critical role in recognizing 
and reasoning about the intentions of others (&ldquo;mentalizing&rdquo;), forming judgments of 
others (&ldquo;person perception&rdquo;) and understanding how others view us (&ldquo;reputation&rdquo;) 
(Amodio and Frith 2006). As such, the preferential MPFC response to someone of 
higher rank in an unstable hierarchy implies greater encoding of the agenda of that 
individual, which is beneficial for predicting his/her future actions (Amodio and 
Frith 2006). The amygdala plays a central role in recognizing emotional salience in 
social environments (Amaral 2002). In an unstable hierarchical setting, activation 
in the amygdala elicited by viewing an individual in the coveted superior position 
as opposed to the inferior position speaks to a heightened emotional arousal to the 
higher-ranked individual. Indeed, this status-related amygdala response is correlat-
ed with one&rsquo;s self-reported desire to occupy the top hierarchical position (Zink et al. 
2008). Similarly, in nonhuman primates, jealousy induced by social hierarchical 
challenge is accompanied by an increase in amygdala activity (Rilling et al. 2004).
</p>
<p>The amygdala is also critically involved in the production of appropriate emo-
tionally driven reactions (Amaral 2002) that are important during periods of social 
hierarchical instability. Neurotoxin lesions of the monkey amygdala (which spare 
adjacent cortical areas and passage fibers) have been shown to increase social fear 
and decrease aggression, resulting in an inability to achieve dominant status during 
the formation of hierarchy in a group of unfamiliar monkeys (Bauman et al. 2006). 
These effects of amygdala lesion, however, may be dependent on age at the time of 
lesion or group familiarity (Bachevalier and Malkova 2006); in another study, neu-
rotoxin amygdala lesions in adolescent monkeys did not affect hierarchical ranks 
when the lesioned monkeys were reintroduced back into a familiar group with a pre-
viously established hierarchy. Rather, after reintroduction, monkeys regained their 
original status, despite the amygdala-lesioned monkeys displaying abnormal social 
behaviors (e.g., increase social fear) (Machado and Bachevalier 2006). Addition </p>

</p>
<p>investigations are therefore necessary to gain a full understanding of the influence 
of amygdala lesions on social behaviors and consequential social rank during hier-
archical instability.
</p>
<p>Neural Processing of &ldquo;Hierarchically Valuable&rdquo; Events
</p>
<p>During periods of hierarchy instability, social ranks within a hierarchy can be rede-
fined based on particular competitive performance-based outcomes or circumstan-
tial incidents. Such a &ldquo;hierarchically valuable&rdquo; event can be either positive or nega-
tive for a given individual depending on the impact it has on one&rsquo;s current social 
standing. For example, within an unstable hierarchy, outperforming a superior can 
increase one&rsquo;s status and thus such an event is associated with positive hierarchical 
value. On the other hand, being outperformed by an inferior can cause a drop in 
one&rsquo;s social ranking and is associated with negative hierarchical value (Marr and 
Thau 2013). Alternatively, outperforming an inferior or being outperformed by a 
superior are events that do not carry hierarchical value because such outcomes do 
not change one&rsquo;s status but rather reinforce the current hierarchical ranking (Zink 
et al. 2008). Using an experimentally created unstable hierarchy, in which ranks 
adjust according to performance in a skill-based hierarchy (described in the previ-
ous section) during functional MRI, Zink and colleagues were able to isolate hu-
man neural responses to both positive and negative hierarchically valuable events  
(Zink et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>Certain brain regions appear to respond to hierarchical value irrespective of va-
lence. Specifically, activity within the occipitoparietal cortex and striatum is in-
creased during both positive and negative hierarchically valuable outcomes com-
pared to nonvaluable outcomes (Zink et al. 2008). As described in the previous 
section, striatal activations convey valence-independent motivational value and 
salience (Blitzer et al. 2013; Jensen et al. 2006; Zink et al. 2006; Zink et al. 2003). 
The occipitoparietal activation in response to events associated with hierarchical 
value likely represents heightened perceptual and attentional processing (Bradley 
et al. 2003) of hierarchically valuable outcomes due to their consequential nature. 
While hierarchical value-related activity in the occipitoparietal cortex and striatum 
does not discriminate between positive and negative valence, the activation patterns 
in other brain areas are specific to particularly valenced (positive or negative) hier-
archically valuable events.
</p>
<p>The anterior insula, part of the brain&rsquo;s pain network, is activated when a lower-
ranked individual outperforms another (Zink et al. 2008). Activity in this brain re-
gion is not only related to physical pain but also emotional pain as evident by its 
response to social rejection (Eisenberger et al. 2003), frustration (Abler et al. 2005), 
and empathically watching a loved one in physical pain (Singer et al. 2004). There-
fore, the anterior insula response to negative hierarchical value likely represents 
frustration and emotional pain evoked by a lower-status individual when he/she 
performs at a relatively superior level. Intuitively, highly ranked individuals in a hi-
erarchy are pegged with the ability to inflict pain (physical and emotional) on those </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>30914 Neural Basis of Social Status Hierarchy
</p>
<p>of lower status; however, during periods of hierarchical instability, the individuals 
in superior positions are the ones with something to lose. A lower-ranked individual 
is capable of eliciting emotional pain by virtue of the threat to overtake the more 
superior position. Additionally, the emotional pain felt by a higher-ranked person 
when outperformed by someone of lower status should be greater in individuals 
who most wish to remain in the superior position. In fact, Zink et al. (2008) demon-
strated a positive correlation between anterior insula activity levels during negative 
hierarchically valuable outcomes and the self-reported degree to which one enjoys 
occupying the top position in the hierarchy (Zink et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>Within an unstable hierarchical setting, several brain regions have been shown 
to increase activity during positive hierarchically valuable events, namely, anterior 
cingulate, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and motor areas such as dorsal premotor 
cortex and pre-SMA (Zink et al. 2008). The primate anterior cingulate gyrus is 
critical for mediation the valuation of social stimuli. In nonhuman primates, ante-
rior cingulate gyrus specific lesions induce a social devaluation of dominant rank 
(Rudebeck et al. 2006). The anterior cingulate activation to positive hierarchical 
value, therefore, may convey the high social importance of outperforming a superi-
or. A sense of retaliation can also accompany the outperforming of a superior figure, 
which is coded in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, as this region has previously 
been shown to play an important role in social retaliation (Lotze et al. 2007). Activ-
ity in the dorsal premotor cortex and pre-SMA has previously been associated with 
higher-order action disposition (Lotze et al. 1999; Picard and Strick 1996), which 
raises the intriguing possibility that positive hierarchically valuable outcomes 
which can lead to acquiring a more superior position activate brain regions that 
evoke a bias towards an abstract &ldquo;active,&rdquo; as opposed to passive, state (Zink et al. 
2008). These activation patterns that are evoked by positive, as well as negative, 
hierarchically valuable events were all determined in a performance-based context. 
It is unclear whether the same or different neural activity would emerge in response 
to circumstantial incidents that can alter ranks within a hierarchy.
</p>
<p>Neural Basis of Perception and Representation  
</p>
<p>of Hierarchy Knowledge
</p>
<p>The ability to accurately infer social status within a hierarchy is critical to survival 
and may occur by decoding distinct kinds of nonverbal cues, such as facial and 
body postures (Chiao et al. 2008; Marsh et al. 2009). The capacity to both express 
and recognize social status from nonverbal cues represents a core social cognitive 
capacity supported by a number of distinct brain regions. For instance, unlike moral 
cognition, patients with ventromedial prefrontal brain damage show intact social 
status recognition, despite the inability to make typical moral judgments or under-
stand social norms, suggesting the importance of understanding social status cues 
(Karafin et al. 2004). Convergent evidence from neuroimaging studies of social 
status inference show that a network of brain regions, specifically the inferior pari-
etal lobe (IPL), dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, VLPFC), </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>as well as posterior regions of the occipitotemporal lobe, such as the fusiform and 
lingual gyrus, are recruited during the inference of social status or dominance from 
nonverbal cues (Fig 14.1).
</p>
<p>Across the animal kingdom, physical cues, such as body size, provide important 
information about the status of others within a given hierarchy. Facial and body pos-
tures that expand perceived or actual body size are often inferred as dominance dis-
plays, whereas facial and body postures that constrict or restrict actual body size and 
inferred as submissive displays. Additionally, facial features such as direct gaze that 
signal approachability and mature facial features that signal older age provide im-

<p>portant cues of social status. Perceiving social status from the face occurs rapidly, 
approximately 170 ms, after the initial percept is shown within occipitotemporal 
regions of the face, including the fusiform and lingual gyrus (Chiao et al. 2008). 
Furthermore, neural response within the fusiform and superior temporal gyrus in-
creases when perceiving directly compared to averted eye gaze, suggesting that 
enhanced attention toward high status cues modulates neural bases of social per-
ception (Chiao et al. 2008). Lateral prefrontal cortex is engaged when inferring 
social dominance and submission from nonverbal cues, such as expanded or re-
stricted body postures, likely due to the importance of retrieving and maintaining 
knowledge of social rules in accordance and in response to appropriate social status 
signals (Marsh et al. 2009). During more complex social tasks such as watching 
social interactions that involve authority rank compared to communal relations, the 
anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus is also recruited, suggesting that neu-
rons within this brain region codes for rank relations to a greater extent compared to 
horizontal social relations (Iacoboni et al. 2004), possibly due to the variability of 
social attention and gaze following during hierarchical social interactions (Allison 
et al. 2000; Ellyson and Dovidio 1985) and possibly experience of cognitive fluency 
when learning social hierarchical information (Zitek and Tiedens 2012).
</p>
<p>In order to determine the relative status of people and objects, the brain requires 
machinery that enables comparison as well as representation of features or dimen-
sions by which the social status of information can be inferred. Numerical compari-
son, or determining the relative amount of space, time, size or quantity, of a person&rsquo;s 
appearance or belongings appears to be crucial to social status inference (Chiao 
et al. 2004, 2009). People take longer time to compare two objects or numbers 
that are closer in numerical value compared to those farther in numerical value, a 
phenomenon known as the numerical distance effect (Deheane et al. 2009; Cohen-
Kadosh et al. 2008; Walsh 2003). In behavioral studies of the mental representation 
of social status, Chiao et al. (2004) showed that naval Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training 
Corps (ROTC) cadets were slower to compare not only numbers but also naval 
ranks, closer together in quantity and status, respectively, relative to those farther 
apart. These findings suggest that mental representations of social status share spa-
tial properties similar to those of number.
</p>
<p>Several neuroimaging studies have sought to identify the neural mechanisms re-
sponsible for the representation of social status knowledge. One putative mechanism 
is the inferior parietal sulcus (IPS) due to the important role that this brain region 
plays in the representation and manipulation of quantitative information (Cohen-
Kadosh et al. 2008; Walsh 2003). Supporting this hypothesis, Chiao et al. (2009) 
found that activity within the IPS was higher when judging social and physical sta-
tus cues, such as faces and objects, that were closer in social rank compared to those 
farther in rank, demonstrating that neural magnitude is a predictor of status distance 
(Chiao et al. 2009). Status may be achieved not only with the acquisition of mate-
rial resources but also with the acquisition of moral resources, such as spiritual or 
divine respect. When inferring social status in both the financial and moral domains, 
Cloutier et al. (2012) recently found that IPS was recruited similarly during finan-
cial and moral status judgments, demonstrating that both perceptual and conceptual </p>

</p>
<p>representations of social status are stored within the IPS. Future research with a 
multimethod approach, including transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, lesion 
studies, and neuroimaging studies using multivoxel pattern analysis, are needed to 
determine whether neural representations within the IPS are necessary to compute 
social status judgments as well as the relative distinctiveness or overlap in neu-
ral representations within social status and nonstatus judgments related to number, 
space, and time, which have been previously demonstrated as stored within the IPS.

<p>In several species, the serotonergic system is implicated in the determination and 
maintenance of social status within a hierarchy. Serotonin is critical for the regu-
lation and expression of social aggression (Lucki 1998), serving to dampen ag-
gressive behaviors and enhance affiliative behaviors toward others (Carrillo et al. 
2009; Raleigh et al. 1991). The importance of aggression or affiliative interactions 
to establish social status varies by species. Therefore, the directionality of the as-
sociation between serotonergic activity and social rank is dependent on the species-
specific preponderance of aggressive versus affiliative behavior to establish status.
</p>
<p>For some species, including lizards, rats, and certain primates, dominance is 
largely determined and maintained by successful aggressive interactions and fight-
ing prowess. In such species, enhanced serotonin activity has been associated with 
diminished social status. For example, pharmacological enhancement of serotonin 
neurotransmission in dominant lizards and rats&mdash;via the use of selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (e.g., femoxetine and sertraline), serotonin receptor agonists 
(e.g., quipazine), and serotonin precursors (e.g., tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryp-
tophan)&mdash;negates or reverses dominant status, i.e., the dominant animals become 
subordinate (Kostowski et al. 1984; Larson and Summers 2001). On the other hand, 
pharmacological dampening of serotonergic function&mdash;via serotonin synthesis 
blockage with p-chlorophenylalanine, administration of the serotonin receptor an-
tagonist, metergoline, or by lesioning the ralphe nucleus where serotonergic neurons 
originate&mdash;transformed subordinate rats into dominant rats (Kostowski et al. 1984). 
Furthermore, female cynomolgus monkeys with lower baseline cerebral spinal fluid 
(CSF) concentration levels of the major serotonin metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic 
acid (5-HIAA)&mdash;an indicator of serotonin activity&mdash;become dominant rather than 
subordinate during hierarchy formation, and CSF 5-HIAA remains remain lower in 
dominant animals in stable hierarchies (Riddick et al. 2009). Also, it has been dem-
onstrated that talapoin monkeys with higher levels of CSF 5-HIAA during hierarchy 
formation occupy subordinate positions (Yodyingyuad et al. 1985). Moreover, sub-
ordinate rats have higher brain tissue levels of 5-HIAA in the preoptic area, amyg-
dala, hippocampus, spinal cord, and entorhinal cortex compared to dominant and 
individually housed rats (Blanchard et al. 1991, 1993). While the aforementioned </p>

</p>
<p>findings provide strong evidence for a negative correlation between activation of the 
serotonergic system and dominant status, such directionality appears to be specific 
to those species that rely on aggression for dominant-status achievement.
</p>
<p>In several primate species, including vervet monkeys, rhesus macaques, and 
humans, high status is predominantly established by the ability to form affiliative 
relationships and by the ability to recruit allies during conflict, rather than an in-
dividual&rsquo;s fighting ability (de Waal 1986; Higley et al. 1996; Raleigh et al. 1991). 
Within such species, increased serotonin activity has been associated with height-
ened social hierarchical rank. For example, during hierarchical instability, in vervet 
monkeys, occupation of the dominant position can be prevented by pharmacologi-
cal dampening of central serotonergic activity via administration of cyprohepta-
dine, a serotonin receptor antagonist, or fenfluramine, an amphetamine derivative 
which decreases serotonin function when given chronically. Alternatively, phar-
macological enhancement of central serotonin activity&mdash;via administration of the 
serotonin precursor, tryptophan, or serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine&mdash;leads 
to obtainment of high social status (Raleigh et al. 1991). Furthermore, it has been 
demonstrated in male vervet monkeys that whole-blood serotonin concentrations 
are significantly greater in dominant individuals than subordinate, and these lev-
els are altered during status change; status changes from subordinate to dominant 
are accompanied by a rise in blood serotonin concentration, while changes from a 
dominant to a subordinate position or to social isolation are accompanied by a de-
cline in serotonin concentration (Raleigh et al. 1984). Enhanced serotonin activity 
being associated with heightened social status has been shown in rhesus macaques. 
Specifically, higher baseline CSF 5-HIAA (a major serotonin metabolite) predicts 
acquisition of higher rank during hierarchy formation (Higley et al. 1996), and CSF 
5-HIAA levels remain significantly elevated in the individuals holding the domi-
nant compared to subordinate position in stable social hierarchies (Higley et al. 
1996; Westergaard et al. 1999). Similar evidence in humans is scarce because the 
situation in humans is complicated by the fact that people simultaneously occupy 
different social ranks in multiple different hierarchies (Raleigh et al. 1984); how-
ever, it has been shown that healthy individuals treated with citalopram, a selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor, are judged by their peers to be less submissive, display 
dominant patterns of eye-contact in social interactions, and engage in more affilia-
tive and cooperative behaviors with others (Tse and Bond 2002).
</p>
<p>Dopamine Neurotransmitter System
</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that the position one holds in a social hierarchy can have pro-
found consequences on the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system. Using positron 
emission tomography (PET), researchers have shown that uptake of striatal [18F]4-
fluoroclebopride ([18F]FCP), a radioligand that binds to available dopamine D2 
receptors with high affinity (Mach et al. 1996), is greater in dominant female cyno-
molgus monkeys compared to subordinate counterparts (Grant et al. 1998). A strik-
ingly similar effect has also been determined in humans. In men and women, the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>314 N. Pornpattananangkul et al.
</p>
<p>availability of striatal D2 receptors&mdash;as measured by PET [11C] raclopride-binding 
potential&mdash;is strongly correlated with one&rsquo;s social rank and levels of social support 
(Martinez et al. 2009). In animals, it has been established that this change in striatal 
D2 receptor availability occurs in the dominant rather than subordinate animal; the 
ligand uptake measured in subordinates is not different than measurements taken dur-
ing social isolation, whereas dominant monkeys demonstrate a significant increase 
in ligand uptake relative to isolation (Morgan et al. 2002). Once an original rank 
and corresponding alterations to the dopaminergic system have been established, it 
appears that the dopaminergic neurochemical profile cannot be altered or updated 
corresponding modifications in the dopaminergic system require more time to ma-
terialize than following original hierarchy formation. Nader and colleagues have 
found that 3 months following experimentally induced hierarchical rearrangement, 
newly dominant cynomolgus monkeys (some of which were previously subordinate) 
do not have higher levels of D2 receptor availability compared to newly subordinate 
monkeys (some of which were previously dominant) (Nader et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>The higher levels of striatal [18F]FCP uptake in dominant animals may occur 
because of increased D2 receptor levels and/or a decrease in synaptic dopamine 
levels, possibly due to enhanced environmental enrichment experienced in the high-
status position (Morgan et al. 2002). Deprivation of environmental enrichment, i.e., 
isolation, is associated with elevated striatal dopamine levels and decreases in stria-
tal receptor density (Hall et al. 1998; Rilke et al. 1995). It follows, therefore, that 
acquiring dominant rank, which allows animals to be in more control of environ-
mental enrichment, may result in neurochemical changes that decrease basal stria-
tal dopamine levels in high-status individuals resulting in the observed increase in 
ligand uptake (Morgan et al. 2002). Interestingly, this effect may be specific to the 
striatum; dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex, as measured by levels of 
the dopamine metabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), is reduced in iso-
lation (Blanc et al. 1980). In fact, contrary to what would be expected based on the 
direction of the status-dopamine relationship demonstrated in the striatum, CSF lev-
els of the dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA)&mdash;an indirect measure of 
dopamine neural activity&mdash;are greater in dominant cynomolgus monkeys than sub-
ordinate monkeys (Kaplan et al. 2002). CSF measures lack regional specificity, and 
these CSF HVA levels may be reflecting dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex 
rather than the striatum. Future research is required, however, to conclusively ex-
plain directionality inconsistencies and to elucidate the exact neural mechanisms 
underlying status-related alterations of the dopaminergic system.

<p>Gene-by-Environment Interaction in Social  
</p>
<p>Status Hierarchy
</p>
<p>The importance of gene-by-environment (GxE) models of human behavior and psy-
chopathology has become more understood; however, little is known about how 
genetic and environmental factors interact to produce and maintain social status </p>

</p>
<p>hierarchies. Regulation of one&rsquo;s behavior and emotion appears to play an important 
role in establishing and maintaining a social status hierarchy. In chimpanzees for 
instance, subordinate apes are more likely to regulate their responses when going 
for food in the presence of dominant apes, especially when they know that the domi-
nant can see where the food is placed (Tomasello et al. 2003). In humans, people 
often vary in their behavioral regulation as a function of social status hierarchy. 
Those who have lower social power and status often display inhibited, constricted 
postures (Ellyson and Dovidio 1985; Hall et al. 2005), suggesting high regulation 
of behavior (Keltner et al. 2003). Additionally, a recent ERP study provided con-
vergent evidence on the influence of social status hierarchy on regulation by look-
ing at neurocognitive components underlying performance monitoring processes, 
namely, feedback related negativity (FRN) (Boksem et al. 2012). In this study, an 
experimental paradigm that was designed for establishing social status in an fMRI 
context, discussed earlier (Zink et al. 2008), was adapted for an ERP context. Low-
status, compared to high status, individuals were found to elicit higher FRN, reflect-
ing enhanced neurocognitive processes for performance evaluation when they saw 
the outcome of their task. This elevated FRN suggests that people have a higher ten-
dency to regulate their behaviors, possibly through enhanced monitoring processes, 
when they are in a low-social status hierarchical situation.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this increase in behavioral regulation seems to be targeted specifi-
cally at stimuli that are relevant in a social status hierarchical situation, and fur-
thermore, may impair regulation toward nonstatus-relevant stimuli, possibly due to 
the increase in distractibility from nonstatus-relevant environmental cues (Boksem 
et al. 2012a). This has been demonstrated in behavioral experiments where partici-
pants were assessed in their ability to regulate during nonstatus-relevant tasks after 
being primed with social status hierarchy using tasks such as completing a scram-
bled-sentences priming task consisting of social status hierarchical words (e.g., sub-
ordinate and authority) (Smith and Trope 2006) or writing an essay about a situation 
where they had higher social power than others (Galinsky et al. 2003). The essay 
prime on social status hierarchy was recently found to induce brain activity related 
to approach and withdrawal motivational systems, as indicated by EEG frontal al-
pha asymmetry indexes (Boksem et al. 2012b). After being primed with low-social 
status hierarchy, people&rsquo;s regulatory ability toward nonstatus-relevant stimuli wors-
ened (Smith et al. 2008), as suggested by poorer inhibiting and by poorer planning 
performance in Stroop Color Naming (Stroop 1935) and Tower of Hanoi (Goel 
and Grafman 1995) tasks, respectively. High-social status hierarchy priming, on the 
other hand, was associated with an enhancement in regulation during subsequent 
attention tasks (Guinote 2007), such as Frame-Line (Kitayama et al. 2003) and No-
von&rsquo;s Focal-Local (Navon 1977) tasks. Similar to these lines of research, SES, as 
a chronic social status hierarchy, has also been shown to influence neurocognitive 
processes of regulation in a similar fashion (for review see Hackman et al. 2010). 
For instance, 8&ndash;12 year-old children from low-SES families performed worse in 
inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility tasks than their high-SES counterparts 
(Sarsour et al. 2011). In addition, ERP studies have shown impairment in selective 
attention ability among low-SES children. This group of children usually has poorer </p>

<p>suppression ability for nonrelevant stimuli when compared to high-SES children 
(e.g., Kishiyama et al. 2009; Stevens et al. 2009).
</p>
<p>Genetic and cultural factors seem to interact with regulatory process in social 
status hierarchy. Genotypes of some polymorphisms, such as those of serotonin 
transporters 5-HTTLPR and oxytocin receptor OXTR genes, have been identified 
as being associated with regulation, especially in the case of emotion (Canli et al. 
2009; Hariri and Forbes 2007; Kim and Sasaki 2012; Murakami et al. 2009). These 
genes, in turn, may influence how organisms react and regulate their behaviors in 
a social hierarchical environment. For example, in rhesus macaques, Macaca mu-
latta, short&ndash;long allele carriers (SL) of 5-HTTLPR spent less time gazing at the eye 
region of face images and showed larger pupil dilation when looking at the pictures 
of dominant moneys than submissive monkeys (Watson et al. 2009). These effects 
were weaker among monkeys who carried the long&ndash;long allele (LL), perhaps im-
plying the influence of 5-HTTLPR on intensified or attenuated aversion to social 
status hierarchical cues. This eye-movement pattern of S-allele macaques toward 
faces is similar to that which was found among human subjects from East Asia, 
where a high proportion of S-allele carriers was found (Chiao and Blizinsky 2010) 
and where social hierarchical power is often unequally distributed, as reflected in 
high scores in power distance index (PDI) (Hofstede 2001) (Fig. 14.2). Specifi-
cally, Blais et al. (2008) demonstrated that East Asian participants from Japan and 
China spent less time fixating on the eyes of face pictures than Westerner partici-
pants from Scotland. East Asian participants tended to avert the eyes and instead 
focused on the nose region of the images. Additionally, Jarrell et al. (2008) con-
ducted an experiment with the same species of rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta. 
In this experiment, the researchers reorganized female monkeys into a new group 
of five that consisted of different carriers of the 5-HTTLPR genotype. Hence, these

<p>monkeys were forced to establish a new social status hierarchy within the newly 
formed group. It was found that S-allele carriers expressed the highest levels of 
both submissive and aggressive behaviors toward other group members. This pat-
tern of behavior among S-allele carriers is similar to what one would expect from 
human societies in which cultural values are high in PDI (Hofstede 2001), where 
high-power inhabitants have a tendency to be aggressive to others while low-power 
inhabitants are often submissive. Consistent with this view, comparing across all 
species of rhesus monkeys, Chiao (2010) found that species whose societies are 
more tolerant with a lenient hierarchy and a relaxed dominance usually carry only 
the L-allele of 5-HTTLPR. However, species that are intolerant and have a strict 
hierarchy, including Macaca mulatta, carry at least one S-allele. Additionally, Burt 
(2008) found evidence of gene-environment correlation or evocative rGE whereby 
individuals elicit or select experiences consistent with their genotypes. Specifically, 
Burt (2008) found evidence that the serotonin receptor gene 5-HT2A is correlated 
with social popularity, suggesting that this gene predisposes people to particular 
social status outcomes
</p>
<p>.
Altogether, these lines of evidence suggest a complicated 
</p>
<p>interplay between genes and cultures in the regulation of one&rsquo;s behavior in a social 
status hierarchy, thus opening many interesting questions for future research.
</p>
<p>Cultural Neuroscience of Social Status Hierarchy
</p>
<p>Cultural norms differ in the extent to which social hierarchy or egalitarianism is 
reinforced in social interactions, as well as the relative social value of traditional 
social status cues (Hofstede 2001). Understanding how cultural and biological fac-
tors independently and interactively maintain and reproduce social hierarchies is 
necessary for understanding the evolutionary origins of status hierarchies. Recent 
evidence from cultural neuroscience indicates that cultural values of social dom-
inance hierarchy modulate neural response during social cognition. Cheon et al. 
(2011) showed that people living in cultures that strongly prefer hierarchy, such as 
Korea, show increased left temporoparietal junction (L-TPJ) response when view-
ing group members in emotional pain, compared to people living in cultures that 
strongly prefer egalitarianism, such as the United States. People living in hierarchi-
cal cultures are more likely to recruit regions associated with conceptual processing 
of others, such as theory of mind, when responding to their distress cues, whereas 
people living in egalitarian cultures are more likely to recruit regions associated 
with simulative processing of others (Chiao et al. 2009; Mathur et al. 2010). Fur-
thermore, Freeman et al. (2009) found cultural variation in the right caudate and 
medial prefrontal cortex to nonverbal status cues, such as bodily postures, as a func-
tion of interindividual variation of dominance. Taken together, these findings indi-
cate that the preference for social hierarchy modulates brain regions important for 
social cognition as well as empathy and altruism.
</p>
<p>Cultural norms reinforce social status signaling not only from nonverbal cues, 
such as body postures, but also from symbolic cues, such as money. However, the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>318 N. Pornpattananangkul et al.
</p>
<p>relative importance of money or intrinsic reward associated with money and finan-
cial status varies across cultures, due to cultural influences on processing within 
the ventral striatum. Kim et al. (2012) recently found that Americans show greater 
delay in discounting of financial rewards and stronger ventral striatum response 
to immediate rewards compared to Koreans. Furthermore, rewards elicited greater 
ventral striatum response in Koreans when presented with delay, indicating corre-
spondence between the neural and cultural valuation of reward. These findings indi-
cate that when people from a short-term orientation culture are exposed to monetary 
rewards, the ventral striatum shows increased response compared to when people 
from a culture of long-term orientation are shown monetary rewards, which is likely 
due to the lack of cultural emphasis on experiencing gain in the immediate context.
</p>
<p>Cultural variation in emphasis on family obligation also affects the social val-
ue of financial status. Telzer et al. (2010) recently found that whereas Caucasian-
Americans show increased mesolimbic response when receiving a monetary reward 
themselves, by contrast, Latinos showed greater activity in neural reward regions 
when donating to family, rather than when receiving monetary reward. Growing up 
a cultural community that emphasizes social harmony with others, Latino adoles-
cents may find monetary rewards less rewarding than social bonds with or fulfill-
ment of social obligations to close others. In turn, showing strong observance of 
family obligation may neurally be computed as greater in social status or social 
value compared to financial status or monetary gain.
</p>
<p>Importantly, while the brain may not compute gains in SES as intrinsically re-
warding compared to fulfillment of social obligations or demonstrations of cultural 
competence more generally, nevertheless, SES affects how the brain processes in-
formation. For instance, people with high SES are more likely to show increased 
ventral striatum response to high-status information about others, whereas people 
with low SES are more likely to show increased ventral striatum response to low-
status information, indicating that processing social information about others in 
one&rsquo;s SES is rewarding (Ly et al. 2011). After perceiving others in pain, people with 
high SES are more likely to show a positive association between neural response 
within empathic pain regions and charitable donation, whereas people with low 
SES show a negative association (Ma et al. 2011). People of lower-social status are 
more likely to recruit neural response within neural regions associated with mental-
izing, specifically dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial prefrontal cortex 
(MPFC), precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (Muscatell et al. 2012). 
Hence, perceived and actual SES play a key role in modulating neural response 
within social and affective brain regions. While evolutionarily our brains may have 
intrinsic mechanisms for maintaining and transmitting social status signals, culture 
defines and reinforces what kinds of behaviors constitute social status signals as 
well as the relative fitness value of social status sensitivity as a behavioral pheno-
type.
</p>
<p>Notably, an individual&rsquo;s perception of their relative social status or power can 
modulate how the brain performs cognitive tasks, such as mathematics. Harada et al. 
(2012) recently showed that females who were primed with high or low-social pow-
er showed differences in neural response when solving approximate math problems </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>31914 Neural Basis of Social Status Hierarchy
</p>
<p>(e.g., is 3 + 4 closer to 6 or 9?). Females primed with high-social power performed 
better compared to people primed with low-social power. Neural response within 
the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a region previously associated with cognitive 
interference, was reduced for females in the HP compared to LP group, suggesting 
that even temporarily heightening a person&rsquo;s sense of social power increases math 
performance, possibly by reducing cognitive interference. The experience of being 
high or low power modulates the neural basis of cognition and demonstrates the 
important influence of social status on how the brain computes.
</p>
<p>Conclusion
</p>
<p>Social status hierarchies are a fundamental dimension of social life and critical to 
social organization and group survival. Phylogenetically conserved biological ma-
chinery that relies on serotonergic and dopaminergic neural signaling play key roles 
in regulating brain circuitry associated with the maintenance, regulation, and reci-
procity of social status cues. Population variation in functional polymorphisms that 
regulate serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission likely contribute to the popula-
tion variation in sensitivity and maintenance of egalitarian or hierarchical social in-
teractions. Likewise, cultural norms and values that explicitly or implicitly reinforce 
distinct repertoires of social status behaviors within groups account, in part, for the 
neural variability in response to social status cues across human populations and 
multicultural communities. Less well-understood is how genetic, environmental, 
and cultural factors interactively shape the ability and experience of navigating so-
cial hierarchies across species and cultures as well as the malleability of a propensity 
for hierarchical social experience given a possible role for epigenetic mechanisms 
in the gene-brain-behavior pathway of social hierarchy. Future studies are needed to 
better understand how developmental changes in brain structure and function cor-
respond with sustained and transient features of social status knowledge and experi-
ence, including as the impact of stable and unstable social hierarchies in the social 
environment, acquisition of cultural knowledge and early-life SES on brain devel-
opment. A better understanding of the neural mechanisms of social hierarchy may 
lead to improved preventions and treatments for mental health disorders that involve 
impaired social status cognition, including autism, and social anxiety disorder.

<p>Power and status, and related concepts such as dominance and hierarchical position, 
are not the same though they overlap and share a common theme of ascendancy, 
potency, or social importance. We will use the term vertical dimension (Hall et al. 
2005) to encompass a variety of definitions and functional variations, in contrast to 
the horizontal dimension reflecting socioemotional closeness (Berger 1994;  Osgood 
et al. 1957; Wiggins 1979).
</p>
<p>Verticality can be defined as roles in a formal hierarchy, social influence among 
friends, privileges of behavior control granted by tradition (parents over children, 
husbands over wives), accomplishments or endowments in life (education, income), 
victory in real or symbolic competition, celebrity, respect accorded by others, or 
the personality trait of dominance, among others. Overlap between these concepts 
is great; for example, the social status concept has been defined in the same studies 
as including dominance, importance, prestige, being perceived as commanding and 
powerful, being perceived as &ldquo;boss,&rdquo; and being admired and respected (Shariff and 
Tracy 2009; Tracy et al. 2013).
</p>
<p>There are, nevertheless, important differences. For example, a person can have 
the respect and admiration of others (status) without much asymmetric control over 
resources (power) (Magee and Galinsky 2008). Furthermore, a person&rsquo;s position on </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>J. A. Hall et al.326
</p>
<p>the vertical dimension can be possessed or merely yearned for, wanted or not, legiti-
mate or not. There are also degrees of ecological validity in research on the vertical 
dimension&mdash;from naturally occurring statuses, ranks, and traits, to experimentally 
created roles, to experimental priming where the &ldquo;power&rdquo; concept is only activated 
cognitively.
</p>
<p>By &ldquo;nonverbal communication&rdquo; we refer to two broad categories: first, the be-
haviors that people emit with their face, eyes, body, and voice (independent of the 
words), and, second, people&rsquo;s accuracy in perceiving others&rsquo; states, traits, and per-
sonal characteristics.
</p>
<p>The goal of the chapter is to review how the vertical dimension is related to 
nonverbal communication&mdash;a question that researchers have asked for decades. Im-
portant to this discussion is the fact that the person who is high or low in verticality 
may be experiencing many psychological states&mdash;emotions, cognitions, and mo-
tives&mdash;that may play a role, often an unknown role, in the relation of verticality 
to nonverbal communication either as mediators or moderators (Hall et al. 2005). 
As examples of mediators, if bosses are better at decoding facial expressions of 
emotions than the people below them in the hierarchy, perhaps it is because being 
a boss motivates a person to know those employees or because being a boss brings 
more opportunity to hone interpersonal perception skills. Psychological states may 
also serve as moderators; for example, the relation of verticality to nonverbal com-
munication could be different depending on how people in low and high positions 
are defining and construing their vertical position (for example, what kind of ob-
ligations or privileges it affords, or whether they construe their role as other- or 
self-oriented).
</p>
<p>The fact that verticality has many varieties (Hall et al. in press) is relevant to 
any discussion of its correlates, but it is especially relevant to nonverbal commu-
nication because the ways in which verticality may be associated with nonverbal 
communication are less obvious than for some other kinds of behavior. Some kinds 
of behavior are conceptually related to vertical position in straightforward ways 
and are therefore relatively easy to predict. For example, leaders generally try to 
engage in behaviors designed to lead, bosses usually tell people what to do, people 
with dominant personalities generally try to exert influence over other people, more 
educated people use big words, and rich people (and those wanting to seem rich) 
drive fancy cars.
</p>
<p>However, prediction in the case of nonverbal communication is harder to make, 
for two reasons. One is that nonverbal behavior is often ambiguous in its meaning, 
so that the same behavior may occur in different circumstances or be displayed by 
different actors for different reasons. A boss might talk in a loud voice in order to 
convey authority, but a subordinate might talk in a loud voice in order to impress 
the boss with her assertiveness.
</p>
<p>The other reason prediction is hard when it comes to nonverbal communication is 
that the psychological states alluded to previously (emotions, cognitions,  motives) 
are likely to be key determinants of nonverbal behavior or accurate interpersonal 
perception (Hall et al. 2005), yet such states are not so easily predicted from the 
general concept of &ldquo;verticality,&rdquo; as the following thought experiments illustrate. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15 Nonverbal Communication and the Vertical Dimension of Social Relations 327
</p>
<p>The motive to appear intelligent could be strong in either high-ranking or low-rank-
ing individuals, depending on context. Such a motive could determine who has the 
more serious demeanor, yet without knowing what state the high and low people are 
in, no prediction about the effect of verticality on serious demeanor could be made. 
Along the same lines, either a high or low person could be motivated to appear 
friendly and either a high or low person could be cognitively overloaded. Wanting 
to appear friendly might make you smile more and being cognitively loaded might 
impair your accuracy in perceiving other people&rsquo;s feelings, but no clear prediction 
from verticality could be made without knowing how eager to appear friendly and 
how overloaded the high and low people are.
</p>
<p>The point is not that nonverbal behavior has an unknown or unknowable rela-
tion to verticality&mdash;indeed, the remainder of this chapter will summarize what is 
known&mdash;but rather that there are reasons to expect complex and variable associa-
tions. Because most studies do not measure the psychological states that accompany 
or follow from verticality, or allow a strong inference as to what they are, it is hard 
to predict what nonverbal cues or what level of interpersonal accuracy to expect. 
And, because there could be much variation between persons in such states, verti-
cality effects may wash out (e.g., some bosses may be punitive and some prosocial, 
even within the same organization) (Galinsky et al. 2006; Schmid Mast et al. 2009). 
Furthermore, as noted earlier, nonverbal correlates that exist for one definition of 
verticality may not hold for another (e.g., personality dominance versus rank in 
an organization). A continuing challenge to research in this area is to move from a 
general verticality concept to a closer look at the particularities of how it is defined, 
operationalized, and construed in a given situation.
</p>
<p>The present chapter has three main parts. The first part is about people&rsquo;s be-
liefs (stereotypes) about the connection of verticality to nonverbal communication, 
people&rsquo;s inferences about verticality based on viewing or listening to excerpts of 
behavior, and people&rsquo;s embodied self-conceptions of verticality based on their own 
behavior (and the consequences thereof). The second part reviews how verticality 
(measured or manipulated) is associated with nonverbal behavior. And the third 
part takes on the topic of interpersonal accuracy&mdash;both the accurate perception of 
verticality and the relation of a person&rsquo;s verticality to his/her accuracy in perceiving 
other states and traits in others.
</p>
<p>Beliefs and Inferences about How Verticality is Displayed 
</p>
<p>Nonverbally
</p>
<p>People quickly, automatically, and effortlessly make judgments of others&rsquo; verticali-
ty (Oosterhof and Todorov 2008). When making judgments on this dimension, there 
is great consensus about who appears to have higher vertical position than whom. 
Research shows that people hold explicit and reportable beliefs (i.e., stereotypes) 
about the nonverbal signals of verticality and they apply these when judging others 
on this dimension.</p>

</p>
<p>Beliefs and Stereotypes about Verticality and Nonverbal Behavior
</p>
<p>Carney et al. (2005) conducted two conceptually identical studies with undergradu-
ate participants that gathered people&rsquo;s stereotypes about verticality differences for 
70 nonverbal characteristics and behaviors. Participants were asked to predict the 
behavior and accuracy of imagined target persons who were high or low either in 
hierarchical rank in a work setting or in personality dominance. Participants had 
very clear and consistent beliefs about the nonverbal display of rank and personal-
ity, with significant effects occurring across both studies for 35 of the 70 behaviors. 
Both women and men were believed to express verticality approximately the same 
way and the beliefs about nonverbal expression did not generally depend on wheth-
er verticality was operationalized as hierarchical rank or personality dominance. 
Among other behaviors, high targets were believed to pay less attention to others 
(which implies less interpersonal accuracy), handshake more, stand closer, touch 
others more, have more expressive faces and overall animation, gesture more, gaze 
more, touch self less, have a more erect posture, lean forward more, and use more 
open body positions. Interestingly, smiling was not believed to be associated even 
though it has been theorized to be higher in low than high vertical people (Henley 
1977). Thus, people do think verticality is associated with many nonverbal cues.
</p>
<p>The Nonverbal Cues that Implicitly Shape Perception of Verticality
</p>
<p>People also have beliefs about the nonverbal expression that may be utilized in an 
implicit way when judging others&rsquo; verticality. That is, there is a set of nonverbal 
behaviors that tend to be present (or absent) when people perceive someone as 
being high or low on the vertical dimension&mdash;but it is unlikely people are explic-
itly aware of what those behaviors are. Here, we address behaviors perceived to 
be associated with verticality, based on the meta-analysis by Hall et al. (2005). 
(This meta-analysis was concerned only with nonverbal displays, not accuracy of 
interpersonal perception.) In this literature, perceivers rated target persons on the 
vertical dimension. Then, the nonverbal behaviors of the targets were measured by 
neutral coders. Those coded behaviors were then correlated with the perceivers&rsquo; 
judgments to reveal the cues that predicted their judgments (e.g., Aguinis and Henle 
2001; Burgoon and Le Poire 1999; Burgoon et al. 1985; Halberstadt and Saitta 
1987; Hall and Friedman 1999).
</p>
<p>Many nonverbal behaviors predicted higher ratings of verticality, a number of 
which converge with the explicit beliefs documented in Carney et al. (2005). Across 
both explicit and implicit beliefs, high vertical people (versus low vertical people) 
are thought to: touch themselves less, touch others more, use more arm and hand 
gestures, have closer interpersonal distances, be more expansive in their body posi-
tions and movements, interrupt more during speaking, have shorter time latencies 
before speaking, use more filled pauses (such as umm and ahh), be more expressive, 
gaze more overall, and have more postural relaxation. Smiling was also negatively 
related to the perception of verticality (with more smiling being associated with </p>

<p>15 Nonverbal Communication and the Vertical Dimension of Social Relations 329
</p>
<p>lower ratings), but when the results for a large group of studies that all used the 
same facial stimuli were combined into an average effect size, this result disap-
peared, consistent with the explicit beliefs uncovered by Carney et al. (2005). Fi-
nally, there is a strong positive relation between speaking time and perceived high 
verticality (meta-analysis of Schmid Mast 2002).
</p>
<p>The Embodied Nonverbal Display of Verticality
</p>
<p>There is good evidence that engaging in behaviors activates neural circuitry con-
sistent with those behaviors. Darwin (1965) proposed that facial expression can 
intensify the experience of emotion in his treatise on the expression of emotion in 
man and animals. While the existence of embodied cognition has been long known, 
and research on the bi-directional link between body and mind has been conducted 
for decades, the term embodiment emerged only recently.
</p>
<p>Examples of feedback from the body to psychological states are now many. 
Wells and Petty (1980) showed that participants were more persuaded by verbal 
messages when induced to nod versus shake their heads laterally. Strack et al. 
(1988) showed that the unobtrusive contraction of the &ldquo;smile muscle&rdquo; (zygomaticus 
major) increased participants&rsquo; ratings of the funniness of cartoons. Other work has 
shown that sitting in an upright posture induces pride (Stepper and Strack 1993), 
and hunched (versus upright) physical postures elicit more feelings of helplessness 
(Riskind and Gotay 1982).
</p>
<p>In the context of the embodiment of verticality, fist clenching increased men&rsquo;s 
self-ratings on power-related traits (Schubert and Koole 2009). Also, approach-
related behaviors (which are associated with verticality; Keltner et al. 2003) can 
be increased through touching and pulling (e.g., Bri&ntilde;ol and Petty 2003; Chen and 
Bargh 1999; Wegner et al. 1994).
</p>
<p>In a more direct test of the embodiment hypothesis in relation to verticality and 
nonverbal expression, Carney et al. (2010) manipulated postures to be expansive-
open versus contractive-closed. Expansive-open postures were expected to activate 
feelings of high verticality and contractive-closed postures were expected to ac-
tivate feelings of low verticality. Indeed, these postures were found to stimulate 
differences in feelings of being powerful and in charge, and changes in testosterone 
and cortisol. Moreover, the expansive-open postures even shaped risk-taking be-
havior. Overall, it seems that nonverbal displays of verticality cause mental and 
bodily changes consistent with the effect of verticality itself.
</p>
<p>Subsequent work by Huang et al. (2011) showed that a pose manipulation was, 
in fact, even more impactful on approach-related behaviors than role-play and re-
call-prime manipulations. Additional work also showed that expansive (versus con-
tractive) postures led to increases in pain tolerance (Bohns and Wiltermuth 2011). 
And current research is showing that expansive postures also lead to increases in 
stress resilience (Carney et al. 2014) and in job interview performance (Cuddy et al. 
2014). In other words, the nonverbal display of power&mdash;acted unobtrusively&mdash;ap-
pears to impact many systems.</p>

</p>
<p>Conclusions and Future Directions Regarding Beliefs, 
</p>
<p>Perceptions, and Embodiment
</p>
<p>Explicit beliefs about verticality and nonverbal communication converge rather 
well with more implicitly measured associations&mdash;that is, perceptions of vertical-
ity based on viewing nonverbal cues. With regard to the embodiment of  verticality, 
the &ldquo;power pose&rdquo; work only examined the expansiveness dimension and future re-
search must explore whether other verticality-related behaviors such as speaking 
time (Schmid Mast 2002), interruptions, and the visual dominance ratio (Dovidio 
and Ellyson 1985) also may be able to produce feelings and subsequent behaviors 
consistent with verticality. Also, no experiment has systematically varied partici-
pants&rsquo; awareness of the pose manipulation to determine if awareness that one is 
&ldquo;doing a power pose&rdquo; disrupts (or perhaps enhances) the phenomenon.
</p>
<p>It is interesting that the nonverbal display of power in belief, perception, or em-
bodiment overlaps considerably with nonverbal cues associated with pride, par-
ticularly with respect to expansive-open versus contractive-closed postures. Tracy 
and colleagues have shown that an expansive nonverbal display is associated with 
pride&mdash;even in the blind (Tracy and Matsumoto 2008). The displays are so close, in 
fact, that research has shown the pride display to activate mental concepts associ-
ated with verticality (Shariff and Tracy 2009; Shariff et al. 2012; Tracy et al. 2013). 
Pride, then, can trigger nonverbal displays that, in turn, influence others&rsquo; percep-
tions along the verticality dimension and likely have feedback effects such as seen 
in the &ldquo;power pose&rdquo; research.
</p>
<p>Nonverbal Behavior and Actual Verticality
</p>
<p>Now we move to nonverbal behavior correlates of actual verticality&mdash;how nonver-
bal behavior differs, or not, between people who have different degrees of vertical-
ity. We focus on the meta-analysis of Hall et al. (2005) in which verticality was 
defined in terms of personality dominance, power roles or rank, and socioeconomic 
status (SES); both experimentally manipulated and preexisting verticality defini-
tions were included. In this meta-analysis, the indicator of effect size was the Pear-
son correlation ( r), signed so that positive values meant that higher vertical people 
displayed more of the behavior and negative values meant the reverse.
</p>
<p>The significant effects (Table 15.1) showed that higher vertical people used more 
open body positions, had closer interpersonal distances to others, were more fa-
cially expressive, spoke more loudly, engaged in more successful interruptions, had 
less vocal variability compared with lower vertical people, and were better able 
to pose emotional expressions in the face and voice. The amount of time a person 
speaks during a social interaction is also a valid cue to a high position on the vertical 
dimension and is, indeed, a more consistent and strong cue than most of the cues 
mentioned above. Meta-analytic evidence shows that superiors talk more than their 
subordinates, people in high-power roles talk more than people in low-power roles, 
and the more a person is dominant as a personality trait, the more he or she talks 
during an interaction (Schmid Mast 2002).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15 Nonverbal Communication and the Vertical Dimension of Social Relations 331
</p>
<p>Importantly, for several of these behaviors there was significant heterogeneity, 
meaning that variation among the effect sizes was greater, often much greater, than 
expected by sampling variation. Efforts to uncover moderator effects were gener-
ally not successful.
</p>
<p>Table 15.1 also shows that for a number of behaviors, including some for which 
there are believed and perceived verticality differences, there was no evidence of 
an actual verticality effect. Though the small number of studies for some behaviors 
prevented strong conclusions, the nonsignificant effects were very small in magni-
tude while often being significantly heterogeneous. For both smiling and gazing, for 
example, the average effects were negligible but there was extreme variation, with 
effects that were both positive and negative. Note, the lack of an overall smiling 
effect is consistent with the believed and perceived results described earlier and is 
contrary to earlier theorizing (Henley 1977). Although overall gaze showed no over-
all relation to verticality, the gaze pattern called the Visual Dominance Ratio (VDR) 
has a robust tradition of findings. The VDR is defined as the percentage of gaze at 
an interaction partner while speaking divided by the percentage of gaze while listen-
ing; a high VDR gives the impression of less conversational attentiveness (Dovidio

</p>
<p>and Ellyson 1985). Research has clearly demonstrated that higher verticality is as-
sociated with a higher VDR for both men and women and for a variety of defini-
tions, such as personal expertise on a topic (Dovidio et al. 1988), objectively mea-
sured rank (Exline et al. 1975), experimentally ascribed status ( Ellyson et al. 1980), 
and personality dominance (Ellyson et al. 1980).
</p>
<p>The example of the VDR demonstrates that an effect for the overall behavior&mdash;in 
this case, overall gazing&mdash;might be negligible while an effect for a more precisely 
defined and nuanced behavior pattern might be easily detectable as a correlate of 
verticality. Another such illustration, also for gazing, is for the &ldquo;prolonged gaze pat-
tern&rdquo;: Both emergent and appointed leaders in three-person groups chose the next 
speaker by engaging in prolonged gazing at that person as the leader nears the mo-
ment of yielding the floor (Kalma 1992). Both this and the VDR are likely strong, 
yet subtle, methods of nonverbal social influence related to verticality.
</p>
<p>One important kind of moderator that the meta-analysis could not address was 
the salience of their vertical position to the people being observed. The relative 
verticality of two people may sometimes be the overriding dimension of relation-
ship (the example of master and slave comes to mind), but sometimes there may be 
multiple dimensions or functions to an interpersonal relationship among which ver-
ticality is only one, and perhaps not the most important one in producing behavioral 
effects. For example, two best friends may differ greatly in social class or occupa-
tional prestige, yet these differences play little role in how they behave with each 
other; indeed, they may go to pains not to let this happen. With many studies in this 
literature being on college students, the verticality differences that existed (whether 
manipulated or naturally occurring) may have been not very salient or important 
and therefore might have exerted weak influences on nonverbal behavior. More 
studies of ecologically meaningful verticality, such as that of Dean et al. (1975) 
on interaction distances between men holding differing military ranks, are needed.
</p>
<p>Several other important questions were not, or could not, be addressed in Hall 
et al.&rsquo;s (2005) meta-analysis. The only effects summarized were main effects of the 
actor&rsquo;s verticality. Some studies in the literature have also found target effects, that 
is, people treat high and low vertical people differently. Curvilinear effects have 
also been found and these are, in fact, probably ubiquitous in life (highest or lowest 
levels of the behavior occurring in equal compared with unequal verticality interac-
tions). Dean et al. (1975) found both such trends for interaction distance between 
military personnel of different ranks. Other limitations of the meta-analysis should 
be noted. One is that in actual interaction, it is likely that people reveal or display 
their high or low verticality in multiple behaviors simultaneously. Analyzing behav-
iors individually probably yields effects that are smaller than would be obtained if 
several behaviors were considered at once.
</p>
<p>Also, many one-of-a-kind studies have been done. We already mentioned 
 Kalma&rsquo;s (1992) study on the prolonged gaze pattern, and other examples include 
Gifford&rsquo;s (1994) finding that people higher in personality dominance engaged in 
less object manipulation, and Kraus and Keltner (2009)&rsquo;s finding that a person 
higher in SES was more likely to disengage nonverbally during an interaction with </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15 Nonverbal Communication and the Vertical Dimension of Social Relations 333
</p>
<p>a person of lower SES (more self-grooming, object manipulation, doodling) and 
also to do less gazing, laughing, and nodding. The fact that Gifford&rsquo;s (1994) study 
on dominant personality and Kraus and Keltner&rsquo;s (2009) study on SES contradict 
each other on object manipulation highlights the difficulties in finding consistent 
patterns in this literature.
</p>
<p>In another unique study, Kraus and Chen (2013) examined physical dominance 
in relation to smiling, finding that contenders in mixed martial arts contests were 
more likely to win if they did not smile in a posed photograph taken prior to the bout 
(posing in a fighting stance with their competitor). This could indicate that smiling 
leaked the losing fighter&rsquo;s feelings of weakness, nervousness, or reduced aggressive 
intentions, or it could indicate that not putting on an intimidating facial expression 
gives the opponent a psychological advantage. In this instance, as in many other 
studies, the causal paths and mediators are unclear.
</p>
<p>Conclusions and Future Directions Regarding Nonverbal 
</p>
<p>Behavior and Actual Verticality
</p>
<p>Much more research is needed on how a person&rsquo;s vertical position is related to 
his/her nonverbal behavior. Much of the literature is correlational, meaning causal 
paths are often unclear. Mediating mechanisms are virtually unknown, meaning 
we cannot answer important questions such as why are higher vertical individuals 
more accurate in expressing emotions through nonverbal cues (Table 15.1). Also the 
inconsistency between results of studies demands focused research on moderating 
factors: Why do some studies find opposite results from other studies?
</p>
<p>Verticality and Accuracy of Interpersonal Perception
</p>
<p>For the remainder of the chapter, we focus on interpersonal accuracy, defined as 
the precision with which people infer or recall other people&rsquo;s states, traits, personal 
attributes, or behavior. We focus both on how accurate people are when inferring 
other people&rsquo;s vertical position (&ldquo;who&rsquo;s the boss&rdquo; in a social setting) and on how 
one&rsquo;s own vertical position influences the extent to which that individual is accurate 
when inferring and recalling other people&rsquo;s states or traits.
</p>
<p>Accuracy of Perceiving Verticality
</p>
<p>How accurate are people in judging &ldquo;who&rsquo;s the boss&rdquo; in social situations? Being able 
to judge others&rsquo; verticality is an especially important skill, given its highly adaptive 
value. Knowing who the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; is makes it easier to communicate efficiently in </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>J. A. Hall et al.334
</p>
<p>order to achieve one&rsquo;s goals (e.g., address those who have the resources). Such 
knowledge also helps maintain the existing social order. So if this skill is highly 
adaptive, are people good at it? As mentioned in a previous section, not all cues that 
people use to infer another&rsquo;s verticality are actually valid. Still, despite using some 
inaccurate cues, research shows that people can assess others&rsquo; vertical position bet-
ter than chance level and can, in fact, be quite accurate. For example, perceivers 
who looked at photographs of two university employees were better than chance at 
inferring the relative status of the two people in the picture (Schmid Mast and Hall 
2004). Similarly, perceivers were able to identify accurately which of two target 
people was the boss based on photographs (Sternberg and Smith 1985).
</p>
<p>Ratings of others&rsquo; personality dominance may also be quite accurate. In one 
study, perceivers&rsquo; ratings of chief executive officers&rsquo; (CEOs) dominance based on 
their photographs significantly predicted the CEOs&rsquo; companies&rsquo; earnings (Rule and 
Ambady 2008). This result may be an indirect indicator of accuracy in judging 
dominance if the CEOs&rsquo; dominance was responsible for the performance of the 
company. Recent evidence also suggests that dominance cues are processed simi-
larly across different cultures (Bente et al. 2010; Rule et al. 2011), although ver-
ticality relations are more clearly displayed through nonverbal behavior in some 
countries (e.g., Germany) than others (e.g., United States, United Arab Emirates; 
Bente et al. 2010).
</p>
<p>The ability to assess verticality in others seems to occur early in development 
(Antonakis and Dalgas 2009). Children were presented with pairs of photographs 
depicting real politicians involved in a past election. Their task was to decide which 
one of the two men they would choose as a captain of a boat in a computer-sim-
ulated game involving a boat trip. Children&rsquo;s decisions reliably predicted actual 
election results (i.e., which of the two candidates was actually elected) and were not 
significantly different in their accuracy compared with the decisions of adults. The 
ability to mentally represent social dominance and power can occur even in prever-
bal infants: As early as 10 months old, infants were able to use the relative size of 
nonhuman agents to mentally represent dominance and predict which agent would 
win in a contest (Thomsen et al. 2011).
</p>
<p>Thus, people can be quite accurate overall in their verticality assessments, even 
though there are few specific nonverbal behaviors that are consistently indicative of 
actual verticality (see Table 15.1). Moreover, some nonverbal cues are perceived to 
be significantly related to verticality (e.g., smiling, other-touch), when in fact they 
are not related overall to actual verticality (Hall et al. 2005). This conundrum may 
be explained if we consider that it may not be single cues that predict accuracy, but 
rather a pattern or combination of different cues and the absence of others. In other 
words, assessing verticality may be a Gestalt-like impression formation process. 
For example, a nonverbal behavior pattern involving touching, pointing at the other, 
invading space, and standing over the other has been related to perceived domi-
nance (Henley and Harmon 1985). Thus, people may be accurate not necessarily 
because they can judge individual cues accurately; instead, what matters is the man-
ner in which they weigh the relevance of each nonverbal cue in the given context.</p>

<p>15 Nonverbal Communication and the Vertical Dimension of Social Relations 335
</p>
<p>The Perceiver&rsquo;s Verticality and Accurate Perception
</p>
<p>For decades, there has been an ongoing debate in the literature: Who is better at 
&ldquo;reading&rdquo; others? Are high vertical people more interpersonally accurate than low 
vertical people, or vice versa? More than 90 studies directly tested this research 
question (for a meta-analytic review, see Hall et al. in press). In these studies, peo-
ple (perceivers) make inferences about others&rsquo; (targets&rsquo;) states or traits, either in a 
controlled testing paradigm (in which participants infer people&rsquo;s states based on 
videos, photographs, or other recorded material) or, to a lesser extent, in the context 
of actual social interactions in which participants infer other people&rsquo;s states after 
actually interacting with them&mdash;the in vivo paradigm. Accuracy tests in the testing 
paradigm are scored against a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; criterion and can include established instru-
ments such as the Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity (PONS; Rosenthal et al. 1979) 
or the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy (DANVA; Nowicki and Duke 
1994). In the in vivo paradigm, people are asked to make judgments about others 
during or following an interaction, with the criterion being the self-ratings made by 
the partner-target (e.g., the perceiver is asked how their interaction partner felt, and 
their answer is compared against the partner&rsquo;s self-ratings of his/her affective state).
</p>
<p>For the most part, this research focused on how people make inferences about 
other people, particularly how people infer the affective states of others. A different 
type of accuracy that is measured in this literature is accuracy of recalling informa-
tion about another person, such as the words that the target person said or wrote, or 
the person&rsquo;s nonverbal cues.
</p>
<p>Individual studies have found support for both hypotheses: that low vertical peo-
ple are more accurate than the high and that high vertical people are more accurate 
than the low. For the remainder of the chapter, we will describe these two opposing 
views and the empirical findings that support them, for both the testing paradigm 
and the in vivo paradigm. We additionally discuss possible moderators of this rela-
tionship, as well as the gaps and possible future directions in this line of research. 
The following section discusses studies in the testing paradigm and in vivo studies 
will be discussed in a later section. However, the theoretical arguments generally 
apply to both.
</p>
<p>Low vertical people are more accurate than high vertical people One view is 
that low vertical people are more accurate than the high at perceiving others, primar-
ily because it is adaptive for them to be accurate. For example, subordinates may be 
motivated to discern and learn their superiors&rsquo; intentions, moods, and desires. By 
knowing these states, superiors may become more predictable, which would help 
subordinates to adjust their own behavior in order to achieve their desired goals. 
Thus, accurate interpersonal perception becomes an adaptive skill for those with a 
power disadvantage (Thomas et al. 1972; Henley 1977).
</p>
<p>If low vertical people have an advantage in terms of accuracy, this effect may 
also be driven by the high vertical people being especially low in accuracy. Per-
haps high vertical people do not need to be accurate, do not want to be accurate, 
or do not have the cognitive capacity to be accurate (Fiske 1993; Russell and Fiske </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>J. A. Hall et al.336
</p>
<p>2010). Given that they do not depend on others and they control relevant resources, 
high vertical people may not be motivated to know subordinates&rsquo; feelings, thoughts, 
or expectations. Alternatively, because of high cognitive demands that come with 
some high vertical positions, such people may not have the cognitive capacity to 
attend to the feelings and behaviors of others.
</p>
<p>The hypothesis that high vertical people are less accurate than the low was sup-
ported in some studies, for different definitions of verticality: an experimental prim-
ing induction decreased the ability to recognize others&rsquo; emotions (Galinsky et al. 
2006), personality dominance was negatively correlated with emotion recognition 
(Moeller 2011), and high SES was associated with reduced empathic accuracy 
(Kraus et al. 2010). Low vertical people were also found to be more accurate in 
recalling information about others, such as who made a sexist remark in an online 
discussion (Barreto et al. 2010).
</p>
<p>High vertical people are more accurate than low vertical people Still other 
studies found the opposite: High vertical people were more accurate. Such people 
may be motivated to know others because others depend on them and because oth-
erwise they would lose the respect and support of their followers, as argued by Hall 
and Halberstadt (1997) and Hall et al. (1997). They need to be accurate in order to 
lead others who accorded them their position. This other-orientation of high vertical 
people was supported by Schmid Mast, Jonas, and Hall (2009), who found that for 
high vertical people, the positive effect on interpersonal accuracy was mediated by 
felt pride and felt respect.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, rather than high verticality making people accurate, accuracy may 
produce high verticality&mdash;in other words, people who have this skill are better able 
to achieve those high positions. This view is especially prevalent in the organiza-
tional and leadership literature (Riggio 2001), where it is generally assumed that 
people become leaders in part because of this interpersonal skill.
</p>
<p>From a cognitive perspective, high vertical people may be more accurate be-
cause they use a global rather than local processing style: They focus on the big 
picture (Schmid and Schmid Mast 2012), a strategy that can facilitate facial emotion 
recognition in certain circumstances (Schmid et al. 2011).
</p>
<p>Finally, it could also be argued that low vertical people, for various reasons, are 
especially low in accuracy, and this drives the advantage that high vertical people 
have in terms of accuracy. Individuals low in verticality may be too demoralized 
or too cognitively loaded to be accurate. Although these mediators have not been 
studied directly, there is evidence that decreased motivation, negative affect, and 
high cognitive load can impair performance on interpersonal accuracy tasks (e.g., 
Ambady and Gray 2002; Horgan and Smith 2006; Phillips et al. 2007).
</p>
<p>The hypothesis that the high vertical people are more accurate than the low is 
supported, for example, in the studies by Schmid Mast et al. (2009), and in the 
meta-analysis it was supported especially within two categories of this research: the 
relation of SES to the accuracy of making inferences and the effect of experimen-
tally manipulated power on recall of interpersonal information, both in the testing 
paradigm. Higher SES was associated with higher accuracy in judging emotions </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15 Nonverbal Communication and the Vertical Dimension of Social Relations 337
</p>
<p>using vocal cues, but also cues from the face and the body (Pfaff 1954; Rosenthal 
et al. 1979; Stokes 1983; Alvarez and Fuentes 1994). Experimentally manipulated 
vertical position similarly showed a significantly positive effect on recall of infor-
mation about other people, such that high vertical individuals remembered more of 
others&rsquo; words compared with individuals assigned to low roles (Overbeck and Park 
2001; Saenz and Lord 1989).
</p>
<p>It all depends: Effects of moderators It can also be argued, as suggested earlier 
in this chapter, that it is unlikely that the relation between verticality and accuracy 
is consistent across situations. Instead, high vertical people might or might not be 
interpersonally accurate compared with low vertical people, depending on other 
factors. Indeed, the meta-analysis showed great heterogeneity across studies in the 
verticality-accuracy relationship and type of personality dominance (prosocial/
responsible versus egoistic/aggressive) was a significant moderator. Different mod-
erator variables may influence the direction of this relationship: goals (prosocial 
versus egoistic, helpful versus punitive), different types of interpersonal accuracy 
(e.g., lie detection, personality assessment, inference about status), emotional states 
(positive versus negative), cognitive load, or motivation (Galinsky et al. 2006; Hall 
et al. 2001; Kraus et al. 2010; Russell and Fiske 2010; Schmid Mast et al. 2009).
</p>
<p>Despite moderators being suggested by a number of authors, there have not been 
many deliberate tests of this hypothesis. One exception comes from Schmid Mast 
et al. (2009), who directly tested moderators by experimentally manipulating em-
pathic versus egoistic mindset for high vertical participants. Findings showed that 
empathic orientation led to higher accuracy of decoding nonverbal affective cues 
compared with egoistic orientation.
</p>
<p>Verticality and accuracy in the in vivo paradigm Studies have also investigated 
this relationship in the context of social interactions (in vivo). A number of these 
studies suggest that there is a tendency for low vertical individuals to be more 
accurate than high vertical individuals (e.g., Delgado-Hachey and Miller 1993; 
Kraus et al. 2010; Letzring 2008). However, these findings should be interpreted 
with caution, given a methodological issue that has profound implications. Accu-
rate perception of another individual depends not only on how accurate the per-
ceiver is but also on how expressive the target person is&mdash;whether the cues from 
the target are clear and recognizable. If targets do not express their feelings, atti-
tudes, or opinions, this has a negative effect on the accuracy of the perceiver in 
decoding those states. Conversely, if targets are &ldquo;an open book&rdquo;&mdash;they clearly 
express their emotions and attitudes&mdash;perceivers are more likely to be accurate 
too. Therefore, in the in vivo tradition, accuracy is typically fully confounded 
between the perceiver&rsquo;s perceptivity and the partner-target&rsquo;s expressivity, as 
pointed out by a number of previous authors (Alkire et al. 1968; Hall et al. 2006; 
Noller 1980; Snodgrass et al. 1998).
</p>
<p>Only three studies (Alkire et al. 1968; Snodgrass et al. 1998; Hall et al. 2006) 
fully addressed the issue of this confound, by measuring the expressivity or commu-
nication clarity of the targets&rsquo; message using independent raters who performed the 
same judgment task as the original perceiver member of the dyad did. For  example, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>J. A. Hall et al.338
</p>
<p>Alkire et al. (1968) had college sorority members and pledges (those wishing to 
join) participate in a dyadic task in which they had to describe the shapes of fig-
ures to the partner without the partner seeing the figures. Initial results showed that 
sorority members were more accurate in perceiving the message coming from the 
pledges than vice versa. Independent participants were asked to listen to the au-
diotapes of these interactions and to perform the same accuracy task as the actual 
participants of the study. Data from these independent listeners showed that the 
sorority members were less clear in communicating their messages. In the light of 
this finding, the authors concluded that the lower accuracy of the pledges might not 
be due to their being lower in vertical position, but rather to the decreased clarity of 
the message. Similarly, in Snodgrass et al. (1998) and Hall et al. (2006), correcting 
for the target&rsquo;s expressivity revealed that perceivers&rsquo; accuracy was accounted for by 
the expressive clarity of the partners.
</p>
<p>The remaining studies in the in vivo tradition either did not control for expressive 
clarity or did not do so in an ideal manner (Gonzaga et al. 2008; Kraus et al. 2010). 
For example, in Kraus et al., the authors measured and controlled for the overall 
expressiveness of the target person who emitted the message and not for the clarity 
of the actual message that was decoded. Because of this methodological issue, it 
is difficult to draw definite conclusions about the verticality-accuracy relationship 
based on studies that used the in vivo paradigm. Future research should correctly 
control for the clarity of the targets&rsquo; communication in order to obtain an unbiased 
measure of how the verticality of perceivers is related to their accuracy in decoding 
those messages.
</p>
<p>Conclusions and Future Directions Regarding Accuracy
</p>
<p>The existing literature reveals that there is no clear overall advantage for higher or 
lower vertical individuals to be generally more accurate, but rather that whether 
this will be the case depends on what definitions of verticality and accuracy are 
used. And when meta-analytic trends or individual studies are significant, there is 
still little known about what mediating mechanisms might be accounting for the 
effects. Though it might be disappointing that sweeping conclusions are not pos-
sible, finding a complicated picture should not be such a surprise considering how 
many operational definitions of the verticality concept there are and the very differ-
ent psychological states that might be caused by, or accompany, them. Identifying 
the factors that moderate verticality-accuracy relations should be a major goal for 
research. One additional problem is that we do not know where the locus of this 
effect is&mdash;if high people have an advantage, is it because they are more accurate 
or because low people are less accurate? Similarly, if low vertical people have an 
advantage, is it because high people are less accurate or low people are more accu-
rate? One way to address this issue is to compare high individuals not only with low 
individuals (as is almost always done in the literature), but also with a condition of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15 Nonverbal Communication and the Vertical Dimension of Social Relations 339
</p>
<p>neutral verticality or some other kind of control condition. In one of the only studies 
that addressed this issue, the accuracy of people assigned to a neutral-vertical con-
dition was closer to the level of accuracy of low vertical people, suggesting that it 
is high vertical position that increased accuracy of emotion recognition rather than 
low position decreasing it (Schmid Mast et al. 2009). However, more evidence is 
needed to investigate the locus of the effect.
</p>
<p>Given that the current findings are not homogeneous, it is not surprising that 
researchers have not focused on mediators&mdash;an effect usually needs to be firmly 
established before investigating its mechanism. Future studies should, however, 
directly test the meditational variables that have been suggested as mechanisms: 
motivation, emotion, cognitive load, cognitive capacity, processing style, etc.
</p>
<p>Finally, future studies should consider investigating accuracy in perceiving 
other content besides affect, which was the content of the accuracy measurements 
in the vast majority of available studies. Other possibilities may include accuracy 
in inferring targets&rsquo; personality traits, attitudes and opinions, intelligence level, or 
 interpersonal relationships. The literature offers little theoretical justification for 
why judging emotions is chosen almost universally as the content of accuracy 
 judgments.
</p>
<p>Closing
</p>
<p>Across humans and other animals, high vertical position means advantaged and ex-
tended survival. Because our very survival depends greatly on having some power 
(or one of its variants, e.g., status, reputation, class, prestige, etc.) or knowing who 
does, humans think about power a lot, practice having it, nonverbally signal it, try 
to figure out who has it, and try to discern what both the high and the low are feel-
ing and thinking. A puzzle yet unsolved about the nonverbal communication of 
verticality is why it is people can accurately detect who has it and who does not, 
yet there are few nonverbal behaviors that are consistently indicative of verticality 
in humans. One possible answer is that there are many ways to show one&rsquo;s vertical 
position but instead of being universal cues, some are much more relevant in certain 
contexts. Also, several weak cues can be a potent signal if they combine. And, of 
course, research has not yet measured all the possibly relevant behaviors, especially 
not all at once. Nonverbal measurement is laborious, meaning that a researcher 
might unknowingly not measure the nonverbal cue that would be especially diag-
nostic in a given context.
</p>
<p>Another unsolved puzzle concerns the link between a perceiver&rsquo;s vertical posi-
tion and his/her accuracy. There is great inconsistency in this literature. It would be 
good to know which features of the situation, judgment, or process (or all three) are 
influencing a person&rsquo;s ability to accurately judge the traits, states, goals, and inten-
tions of others.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we provide an overview of measures and experimental methods 
available for assessing and manipulating social status. Numerous measures and 
 manipulations have been used in the fairly vast literature on social status, so we focus 
our review on a diverse set of methodologies that were systematically developed and 
well validated. In addition, in keeping with the volume&rsquo;s focus on social rank dif-
ferences that arise spontaneously in social interactions, we exclude methodologies 
aimed at measuring or manipulating institutionally endowed differences in power, 
which refers to asymmetric control over resources between, for example, a boss and a 
subordinate. Institutionally endowed power is a related but distinct concept from natu-
rally emerging social rank (see Blader and Chen, Chap. 4, this volume; Magee and 
 Galinsky 2008), and a variety of power measures and manipulations exist (see Smith 
et al. 2008) but are beyond the scope of this review. Subsequently, we first summarize 
available self-reports, peer-reports, and behavioral measures of status; then we review 
experimental methods that have been used to effectively manipulate status.
</p>
<p>Measures of Social Status
</p>
<p>In this section, we provide an overview of the most widely used and well-validated 
measures of social status. These measures can be organized into self-report or peer-
report rating scales and behavioral measures, and are discussed in that order, and 
are listed alphabetically by the lead author&rsquo;s last name. For each measure, we pro-
vide information regarding (a) the original source article detailing the measure&rsquo;s 
 development; (b) our interpretation of the broader, underlying rank-related concept </p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>that the measure assesses; (c) a brief description of the measure; (d) sample items 
(for self- and peer-rating instruments only); (e) psychometric information about 
reliability and validity (i.e., convergent and discriminant validity, generalizability) 
where available (though it should be cautioned that this information reflects charac-
teristics of the measure when administered to the particular sample reported on); (f) 
information about frequency of use, as indicated by the number of citations the arti-
cle has received (an index that overestimates the measure&rsquo;s frequency of use, given 
that these articles are often cited for substantive and other reasons as well); and (g) a 
sample recent article that has used this measure to investigate topics related to social 
rank and, in doing so, has offered further information about its nomological network 
and the underlying rank construct.

<p>Self- and Other-Report Scales
</p>
<p>1. The Personal Sense of Power Scale (Self-Report)
</p>
<p>Originally developed in:
</p>
<p>Anderson, C., John, O. P., &amp; Keltner, D. (2012b). The personal sense of power. 
Journal of Personality, 80, 313&ndash;344. (Includes full scale)
</p>
<p>Broader concept assessed: Social rank and influence.
Scale description: A set of eight items were developed to assess individuals&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>beliefs about their ability to make decisions; influence others&rsquo; behavior, opinions, 
and beliefs; and to satisfy their own wishes and desires within social relationships. 
Participants rate the extent to which they agree with a series of self-statements on a 
seven-point scale (1 = &ldquo;disagree strongly&rdquo;; 7 = &ldquo;agree strongly&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Sample items: &ldquo;I can get him/her/them to listen to what I say&rdquo;, &ldquo;If I want to, I get 
to make the decisions.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Reliability: Scale showed good internal consistency ( αs = 0.76&ndash;0.91), and rat-
ings were moderately consistent across different relationships (e.g., family member, 
teaching assistant, close friend; rs = 0.03&ndash;0.47, M = 0.23).
</p>
<p>Convergent validity: Scale showed good convergent validity with measures of 
related constructs (e.g., dominance, rs = 0.28&ndash;0.59; peer-rated sociometric status, 
rs = 0.33&ndash;0.37; extraversion, r = 0.48; and narcissism, r = 0.46).
</p>
<p>Generalizability: Scale was developed with undergraduates from North  American 
universities.
</p>
<p>Additional information about scale development: Authors began scale develop-
ment with a large initial item pool drawn primarily from an extensive theoretical 
review (Keltner et al. 2003).
</p>
<p>Frequency of use: The original article has been cited 27 times since its publica-
tion in 2012.

tivation: The development of a comprehensive measure. Journal of Occupational 
Psychology, 62, 301&ndash;312. (Includes full scale)
</p>
<p>Broader concept assessed: The desire to achieve social rank and influence.
Scale description: A subscale consisting of seven items from the Achievement 
</p>
<p>Motivation Scale (developed in the same paper) was developed to assess the desire 
to lead or to be in a position of dominance. Participants rate their endorsement 
of several preferences and behavioral tendencies on a three-point scale (0 = &ldquo;No&rdquo;; 
2 = &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; midpoint scale value not given).
</p>
<p>Sample items: &ldquo;I think I would enjoy having authority over other people,&rdquo; &ldquo;When 
a group I belong to plans an activity, I would rather direct it myself than just help out 
and have someone else organize it.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Reliability: Scale showed good internal consistency ( αs = 0.73&ndash;0.81) and split-
half reliability ( rs = 0.70&ndash;0.81).
</p>
<p>Convergent validity: Scale showed good convergent validity with measures of 
status aspiration and competitiveness ( rs = 0.18&ndash;0.93, M = 0.46).
</p>
<p>Generalizability: Scale was developed with undergraduates from North  American 
universities and adults from the general population.
</p>
<p>Additional information about scale development: Authors began scale develop-
ment with a large initial item pool drawn from a number of existing measures used 
to assess a variety of motivations. Exploratory factor analysis was used to arrive at 
the final scale items.

<p>Broader concept assessed: The desire to achieve social rank and influence.
Scale description: A subscale consisting of five items from the Manifest Needs 
</p>
<p>Questionnaire was developed to assess dominant and leadership behaviors in the 
workplace. Individuals rate the frequency with which they (self-report) or students 
in their classes (peer report) engage in certain behaviors, using a seven-point scale 
(1 = &ldquo;never&rdquo;; 7 = &ldquo;always&rdquo;).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>350 J. T. Cheng et al.
</p>
<p>Sample items. &ldquo;I seek an active role in the leadership of a group,&rdquo; &ldquo;I strive to gain 
more control over the events around me at work.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Reliability: Self-reports showed good test&ndash;retest ( r = 0.86) and internal con-
sistency reliability ( α = 0.82). Peer reports elicited high interjudge agreement 
( αs = 0.74&ndash;0.85).
</p>
<p>Convergent validity: Self-reports and peer reports showed good convergent 
 validity ( rs = 0.49&ndash;0.74). Self-reports also showed good convergent validity with 
self-reported Need for Dominance taken from other existing scales (e.g., the 
 Personality Research Form; Jackson 1967; r = 0.62), self-reported preferred work 
preferences (e.g., being a group leader, playing major role in determining group 
performance; rs = 0.39&ndash;0.47), and peer ratings of various aspects of leadership abil-
ity (e.g., control, self-confidence, persuasiveness; rs = 0.29&ndash;0.32).
</p>
<p>Generalizability: Scale was developed with samples of graduate students from 
North American universities and middle-aged North American adults.
</p>
<p>Additional information about scale development: Authors selected items based 
on previously developed taxonomies of human needs (Murray 1938).

<p>4. Perceived Social Status Scale (Self-Report and Other-Report)
</p>
<p>Originally developed in:

<p>Anderson, C., John, O. P., Keltner, D., &amp; Kring, A. M. (2001). Who attains so-
cial status? The effect of personality and physical attractiveness in social groups. 
 Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, 116&ndash;132. (Includes full scale)
</p>
<p>Broader concept assessed: Social rank and influence based on earned respect 
and admiration.
</p>
<p>Scale description: A set of three related measures were used to assess social 
status (defined as the amount of respect, influence, and prominence each member 
enjoys in the eyes of the others), all of which were administered by asking individu-
als to rate members of their social group on the amount of status, influence, and 
prominence&mdash;or on a subset of these&mdash;that the group member has obtained. Rating 
scales and end points varied across measures.
</p>
<p>Items: Scale #1: &ldquo;status,&rdquo; &ldquo;influence,&rdquo; and &ldquo;prominence in the [group]&rdquo; (study 
2); Scale #2: &ldquo;prominence&rdquo; (study 1); and Scale #3: &ldquo;the amount of prominence, 
respect, and influence&rdquo; (study 3).
</p>
<p>Reliability: Scale #1 showed good internal consistency ( α = 0.98), high inter-
item correlations (mean r = 0.93), and high interjudge reliability ( αs = 0.90&ndash;0.97 for 
each item); Scale #2 showed high interjudge reliability ( α = 0.92); Scale #3 showed 
high interjudge reliability (mean αs = 0.81) and strong test&ndash;retest reliability (i.e., 
 long-term stability over 4&ndash;5 months; rs = 0.61&ndash;0.86).</p>

</p>
<p>Convergent validity: Scale #2 was shown to be strongly predictive of one&rsquo;s 
position(s) and office(s) in their fraternity ( r = 0.56). Peer ratings on Scale #3 
were strongly correlated with the target individual&rsquo;s self-ratings on the same scale 
( rs = 0.58&ndash;0.62). Self-reports from all three scales showed good convergent validity 
with self-reported extraversion ( rs = 0.36&ndash;0.48).
</p>
<p>Generalizability: Scale #1 was developed with undergraduate all-female sorority 
groups; Scale #2 was developed with undergraduate all-male fraternity groups; and 
Scale #3 was developed with mixed-gender dormitory groups. All three samples 
were drawn from North American universities.

others&rsquo; respect and admiration, following an experimental manipulation.)
</p>
<p>5. Dominance and Prestige Scales (Self- and Other-Report)
</p>
<p>Originally developed in:

lutionary foundations of human social status. Evolution and Human Behavior, 31, 
334&ndash;347. (full scale included)
</p>
<p>Broader concepts assessed: Social rank and influence based on force and intimi-
dation (dominance), and earned respect and admiration (prestige).
</p>
<p>Scale description: A set of items were developed to assess two dimensions of 
social rank: dominance (i.e., the induction of fear and intimidation; eight items) 
and prestige (i.e., the attainment of respect and admiration; nine items). Participants 
indicate the extent to which each statement describes themselves (for  self-rating 
 version) or a target individual (for peer-rating version) on a seven-point scale 
(1 = &ldquo;Not at all&rdquo;; 7 = &ldquo;Very much&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Sample items: &ldquo;Some people are afraid of me&rdquo; (dominance); &ldquo;Members of my 
peer group respect and admire me&rdquo; (prestige)
</p>
<p>Reliability: Scales showed good internal consistency (αs = 0.83&ndash;0.88 and 
0.80&ndash;0.85 for dominance and prestige, respectively,), and peer reports elicit-
ed high interjudge agreement ( αs = 0.78 and 0.84 for dominance and prestige, 
 respectively).
</p>
<p>Convergent validity: Self- and peer reports were shown to have good convergent 
validity with measures of a range of similar constructs. Dominance was shown to 
correlate positively with narcissism ( rs = 0.22&ndash;0.56), aggression ( rs = 0.35&ndash;0.55), 
agency ( r = 0.46), and peer-rated leadership ( r = 0.40). Prestige was shown to corre-
late positively with social acceptance ( rs = 0.29&ndash;0.59), agency ( r = 0.39), peer-rated 
advice-giving ability ( r = 0.56), and peer-rated leadership ( r = 0.73).
</p>
<p>Discriminant validity: Self- and peer reports were shown to have good diver-
gent validity with measures of theoretically divergent constructs. For example, 
 dominance was shown to correlate negatively with agreeableness ( rs = &minus; 0.39 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>352 J. T. Cheng et al.
</p>
<p>to &minus; 0.61). Prestige was shown to correlate negatively or have no relation with 
 aggression ( rs = &minus; 0.38 to 0.03).
</p>
<p>Generalizability: Scales were developed with samples of undergraduates and 
varsity athletes from North American universities.
</p>
<p>Additional information about scale development: Authors began scale develop-
ment with a large initial item pool drawn primarily from a theoretical model of 
dominance and prestige (Henrich and Gil-White 2001). Exploratory factor analysis 
and confirmatory factor analysis were used to arrive at final scale items and to 
 derive the two-factor structure.

<p>Frequency of use: The original article has been cited 57 times since its publica-
tion in 2010.

<p>6. Agency Subscale of the Revised Interpersonal Adjective Scales (Self- and 
</p>
<p>Other-Report)
</p>
<p>Originally developed in:
</p>
<p>Wiggins, J. S., Trapnell, P., &amp; Phillips, N. (1988). Psychometric and geometric 
characteristics of the Revised Interpersonal Adjective Scales (IAS-R). Multivariate 
Behavioral Research, 23, 517&ndash;530. (Includes full scale)
</p>
<p>Broader concept assessed: Social rank and influence.
Scale description: A set of eight items was developed to assess personal-
</p>
<p>ity characteristics related to agency (i.e., control and assertiveness). Participants 
rate the self-descriptive accuracy of personality adjectives on an eight-point scale 
(1 = &ldquo; extremely inaccurate&rdquo;; 8 = &ldquo;extremely accurate&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Sample items: &ldquo;self-assured&rdquo;; &ldquo;dominant&rdquo;; &ldquo;forceful&rdquo;
Reliability: Scale showed good internal consistency ( αs = 0.79&ndash;0.88 across nine 
</p>
<p>subsamples).
Convergent validity: Scale was shown to have good convergent validity with 
</p>
<p>scales comprising closely related personality adjectives on the interpersonal cir-
cumplex (e.g., arrogant-calculating; gregarious-extroverted). Although specific 
 correlations were not reported, these results were based on indices of spatial prox-
imity&mdash;indicating similarity between constructs&mdash;between the agency scale and 
these related constructs within the circumplex space.
</p>
<p>Discriminant validity: Scale was shown to have good discriminant validity with 
scales comprising divergent personality adjectives on the interpersonal circumplex 
(e.g., unassured-submissive; aloof-introverted). The spatial distances between the 
agency scale and these constructs within the circumplex space were high, indicating 
divergence.</p>

</p>
<p>Generalizability: Scale was developed with undergraduates from North  American

</p>
<p>Additional information about scale development: Authors began scale  development 
with a large initial item pool drawn from a comprehensive taxonomy of personality 
adjectives, which formed the basis for a previously validated version of the scale 
(Wiggins 1979). Principal components analysis was used to arrive at the final scale 
items and the interpersonal circumplex structure. The scale factor structure and reli-
ability were replicated across nine subsamples.

</p>
<p>Broader concept assessed: Social rank and influence in children.
Scale description: A set of six items was developed to assess children&rsquo;s resource 
</p>
<p>control effectiveness in school settings. Teachers rated the extent to which several 
statements accurately characterized children in their classroom on a seven-point 
scale (scale end points and labels not provided).
</p>
<p>Sample items: &ldquo;This child usually gets first access to preferred toys when with 
peers,&rdquo; &ldquo;This child usually plays with the favored toys when with peers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Reliability: Scale showed good internal consistency ( α = 0.91).
Convergent validity: Scale was shown to have good convergent validity with 
</p>
<p>measures of similar constructs (e.g., teacher-rated ranking of students&rsquo; dominance, 
r = 0.62, and teacher-rated aggression and assertion, rs = 0.60&ndash;0.76).
</p>
<p>Generalizability: Scale was developed with North American preschool children.

<p>Behavioral Measures

</p>
<p>Originally developed in:
</p>
<p>Bottger, P. C. (1984). Expertise and air time as bases of actual and perceived 
influence in problem-solving groups. Journal of Applied Psychology, 69, 214&ndash;221.
</p>
<p>Broader concept assessed: Social influence.
Measure description: Participants work collaboratively in small groups on the 
</p>
<p>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-developed moon survival 
exercise, a widely used task for eliciting and observing small groups&rsquo; interactions. 
The task requires individuals to imagine having crash landed on the moon, with only 
15 pieces of equipment available. Individuals are asked to rank order the items in 
terms of their utility for bringing the crew to safety. Participants initially complete 
this task on their own, then solve the problem again collaboratively. Interpersonal 
influence is quantified as the degree of similarity between each individual&rsquo;s response 
and the group&rsquo;s collective decision, with convergence indicating greater influence.
</p>
<p>Generalizability: This measure of social influence was developed with under-
graduate students from North American universities.
</p>
<p>Frequency of use: The original article that detailed this methodology has been 
cited 105 times since its publication in 1984.
</p>

<p>Cheng, J. T., Tracy, J. L., Foulsham, T., Kingstone, A., &amp; Henrich, J. (2013). 
Two ways to the top: Evidence that dominance and prestige are distinct yet viable 
avenues to social rank and influence. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 
104, 103&ndash;125.
</p>
<p>Broader concept assessed: Social rank, under the assumption that higher-ranked 
group members receive greater social attention.
</p>
<p>Measure description: Observers&rsquo; eye gaze is tracked using an eye-tracking de-
vice while they view a video recording of a social interaction among several targets; 
the visual attention received by each target is assessed. Rank is quantified as the 
total duration of visual attention received by each target, averaged across observers.
</p>
<p>Convergent validity: This measure showed good convergent validity with mea-
sures of perceived influence, dominance, and prestige.
</p>
<p>Discriminant validity: Likeability, which is theoretically distinct and perhaps 
even independent from social rank (Wiggins and Trapnell 1996), was found to be 
unrelated to the amount of visual attention received.</p>

<p>Broader concept assessed: Social rank and influence based on respect and 
 admiration.
</p>
<p>Measure description: A pair of participants collaborate virtually in a &ldquo;contrast-
sensitivity task,&rdquo; in which they independently decide which of two checkerboard 
images contains more white area. After providing their own answer, participants 
are shown their partner&rsquo;s answer and given the opportunity to change their response 
accordingly. Influence is quantified as the proportion of trials in which a participant 
changes the participant&rsquo;s response to that of participant&rsquo;s partner, out of the total 
trials in which the two disagree. Because participants know that their partners will 
not be informed of their decision, participants&rsquo; tendency to change their responses 
indicates persuasion and thus influence based on respect, rather than conformity, or 
influence based on dominance/intimidation.

<p>Experimental Manipulations of Social Status
</p>
<p>In the remainder of this chapter, we provide a brief overview of experimental 
methodologies that have been developed and used to manipulate status. These 
 methodologies can be organized under five broad classes: (a) manipulations based 
on thinking or writing exercises, (b) vignette or narrative manipulations, and ma-
nipulations based on altering, (c) dress cues, (d) size cues, and (e) social dynamics </p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>between individuals. These include manipulations that vary the status of the par-
ticipant and those that vary the perceived status of a target individual (as seen from 
the participant&rsquo;s perspective). For each experimental manipulation, we provide (a) 
information on the original published article in which it was used; (b) a description 
of the manipulation; (c) results of any manipulation check; and (d) information 
about frequency of use, in the form of number of citations received by the article 
(note that, as in the case for measures, this indicator overestimates the frequency at 
which the manipulation has been used).
</p>
<p>1. Thinking or Writing Exercises
</p>
<p>A number of experimental manipulations in the form of thinking or writing exer-
cises have been designed to elicit momentary feelings of, or desire for, high (or low) 
social status among participants.
</p>
<p>For example, in Anderson, Kraus, Galinsky, and Keltner (2012c, study 3), partic-
ipants were asked to compare themselves with someone who had either high or low 
status, defined as respect, admiration, and influence. Participants were instructed to 
think about the similarities and differences between themselves and the comparison 
target in an imagined getting-acquainted social interaction. A manipulation check 
suggested that the high-status prompt elicited higher self-reported social standing 
vis-&agrave;-vis others (Cohen&rsquo;s d = 0.54). This article has been cited 18 times since its 
publication in 2012.
</p>
<p>Tiedens, Unzueta, and Young (2007, studies 5 and 6) employed a similar exer-
cise. Here, participants assigned to the high-status condition were asked to write 
about instances from their lives in which they felt self-confident and acted in an 
assertive and directive manner. In contrast, participants assigned to the low-status 
condition described instances in which they felt timid and followed directions from 
others. A manipulation check showed that participants who recalled behaving in 
more assertive ways rated themselves as more dominant and self-assured, in com-
parison to participants who recalled behaving in more submissive ways ( ds = 0.40 
and 0.29). This article has been cited 62 times since its publication in 2007.
</p>
<p>2. Vignettes or Narratives
</p>
<p>Studies have manipulated the status of participants or a target (or targets) using 
vignettes or narratives detailing their demeanor, personality, or behavior in terms of 
influence, assertiveness, dominance, or respect.
</p>
<p>For example, in Griskevicius, Tybur, Gangestad, Perea, Shapiro, and Kenrick 
(2009), participants&rsquo; motivation to seek social rank was manipulated with a short 
story prime describing a protagonist who recently graduated from college work-
ing at his/her first high-status job and aspiring to move up the company&rsquo;s social 
 hierarchy. A manipulation check indicated that this prompt elicited an increased mo-
mentary desire for status and competition ( d = 2.40). The original article in which this 
 manipulation was developed has been cited 93 times since its publication in 2009.
</p>
<p>To vary a target&rsquo;s social rank based primarily on perceived force and threat, 
Sadalla, Kenrick, and Vershure (1987, studies 2, 3, and 4) described the high-status 
target in a vignette as a strong, forceful, powerful, and competitive individual in </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35716 The Assessment of Social Status: A Review of Measures and Experimental &hellip;
</p>
<p>athletic or social contexts. In contrast, the low-status target was described as sub-
missive, timid, deferential, and noncompetitive. A manipulation check showed that 
the target described as strong and forceful was rated as more socially dominant than 
the target described as yielding and submissive ( ds = 1.48&ndash;4.64). This article has 
been cited 295 times since its publication in 1987.
</p>
<p>Building on this initial work, Snyder, Kirkpatrick, and Barrett (2008, study 2) 
developed vignettes that manipulated a target&rsquo;s rank based on respect and admira-
tion; the high-status target was described as a prominent, respectable, confident, 
relaxed, and nonforceful individual. This article has been cited 30 times since its 
publication in 2008.
</p>
<p>3. Altering Dress Cues
</p>
<p>Numerous studies have experimentally manipulated the status of target individuals 
(primarily based upon respect and admiration) by varying their dress.
</p>
<p>For example, high-status targets&mdash;depicted either in person (Fortenberry et al. 
1978) or in photographs (Maner et al. 2008)&mdash;were portrayed wearing professional 
business suits. Conversely, low-status targets were shown as dressed in casual at-
tire. Manipulation checks showed that participants display increased deferential 
behavior toward targets dressed in professional attire (Fortenberry et al. 1978) 
and rate them as higher in social status ( d = 2.85; Maner et al. 2008), compared to 
those dressed in casual attire. These articles have been cited 17 times and 44 times, 
 respectively, since their publication in 1978 and 2008.
</p>
<p>Similarly, in Ratcliff, Hugenberg, Shriver, and Bernstein (2011, study 2), high-
status targets were portrayed wearing uniforms that convey high-status occupations 
(e.g., doctor, judge, four-star general). In contrast, low-status targets wore uniforms 
that convey low-status occupations (e.g., fry, cook, mechanic). A manipulation 
check showed that targets wearing prestigious uniforms were rated as higher in 
&ldquo;status&rdquo; relative to targets wearing less prestigious uniforms ( d = 6.84). This article 
has been cited 19 times since its publication in 2011.
</p>
<p>In Shariff, Tracy, and Markusoff (2012, study 3), participants were shown im-
ages of two identical twins, one wearing a business suit and the other wearing 
dirty rags and blankets. Accompanying textual passages explained that one twin 
worked in finance and the other was homeless. A manipulation check showed that 
the well-dressed twin was rated as higher in status (defined in terms of high rank) 
than the rags-wearing twin ( d = 3.17). This article has been cited two times since its 
 publication in 2011.
</p>
<p>4. Alteration of Size Cues
</p>
<p>A large number of studies have manipulated the social status of either a target indi-
vidual or the participant by varying their posture (expansive and open vs.  contractive 
and closed) and apparent size (big vs. small).
</p>
<p>For example, Sadalla et al. (1987, study 1) manipulated the status of a target 
individual (i.e., an actor) in a video recording by depicting him in a relaxed and 
asymmetrical posture while leaning back in a chair, in sharp contrast to a low-status 
target who appeared tense, constricted, and leaned forward while interacting with </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>358 J. T. Cheng et al.
</p>
<p>another person. A manipulation check showed that the target who displayed a more 
relaxed and expansive nonverbal posture was rated as more socially dominant, com-
pared to the target who displayed more tense and constrictive nonverbal behavior 
( d = 4.64). This article has been cited 295 times since its publication in 1987.
</p>
<p>Tiedens and Fragale (2003) manipulated the perceived status of a confederate 
who interacted face to face with participants in a similar fashion. The high-status 
confederate assumed more space with both the upper and lower body when seated, 
with one arm over the back of the chair and one leg crossed expansively. In contrast, 
the low status confederate sat in a constricted position, with legs together, hands 
in the lap, and a slouched upper body. A manipulation check revealed that the ex-
pansive confederate was rated by participants as more socially dominant than the 
constrictive confederate ( d = 0.80). This article has been cited 319 times since its 
publication in 2003.
</p>
<p>As an example of research that utilized differential physical size to convey target 
status, Thomsen, Frankenhuis, Ingold-Smith, and Carey (2011) showed infants two 
agents represented by two blocks of different sizes, each with an eye and a mouth. 
The larger agent was used to portray a high-status target and the smaller agent a 
low-status target. Results suggested that infants mentally represent relative size as 
a status cue. They demonstrated an expectation (as indicated by looking time) for 
the smaller sized agent to show greater deference to the larger-sized agent but not 
vice versa ( ds = 0.64&ndash;0.90). This article has been cited 43 times since its publication 
in 2011.
</p>
<p>Similar manipulations have been used to vary the status of research partici-
pants. For example, in Carney, Cuddy, and Yap (2010), participants&rsquo; body posture 
was manually configured by experimenters into either a high-status pose entailing 
open limbs and spatial expansion or a low-status pose entailing closed limbs and 
 spatial constriction. A manipulation check confirmed that participants who posed 
expansively reported feeling more powerful and in charge than those who adopted a 
 contractive and closed posture ( d = 0.91). This article has been cited 125 times since 
its publication in 2010. Using a similar posture manipulation, Li Huang, Galinsky, 
Gruenfeld, and Guillory (2011) showed that expansive postures activate not only 
a heightened subjective sense of power ( d = 0.48) but also greater implicit power 
( d = 0.60). Moreover, Bohns and Wiltermuth (2012) adapted this manipulation to 
vary the status both of research participants (study 1) and of a confederate (study 2).
</p>
<p>5. ltering the Social Dynamics Between Individuals
</p>
<p>Finally, diverse experimental manipulations have been designed to systematical-
ly manipulate the social status of participants or target individuals by varying the 
perceived social dynamics between the participant and other group members, or 
 between target individuals and their peers.
</p>
<p>For example, Fast, Halevy, and Galinsky (2012) manipulated the status of par-
ticipants by telling them that they had been virtually paired with a partner to work 
on a collaborative task. Those assigned to the high-status role were informed that 
they would adopt the role of an idea producer, a position that attracts a great deal 
of respect and admiration. In contrast, those assigned to the low-status role were </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35916 The Assessment of Social Status: A Review of Measures and Experimental &hellip;
</p>
<p>informed that they would adopt the role of a worker, a position that receives little or 
no respect and admiration. A manipulation check showed that participants assigned 
to the high-status role perceived their role as affording greater respect and admira-
tion, relative to participants assigned to the low-status role ( d = 2.95). This article 
has been cited 21 times since its publication in 2012.
</p>
<p>In Willer (2009, study 4), after working on a purportedly collective task in 
small groups via networked computers, participants rated the extent to which they 
respected and admired each of the other group members. Participants were then 
shown fictitious average ratings that they received from the other group members. 
Those randomly assigned to the high-prestige condition were shown high ratings, 
whereas those in the moderate- or low-prestige condition were shown moderate or 
low ratings. This article has been cited 137 times since its publication in 2009.
</p>
<p>Finally, in a study that capitalized on the previously documented tendency to pay 
attention to skilled and respected others (Hold 1976), Chudek, Heller, Birch, and 
Henrich (2012) manipulated the perceived status of two target individuals (shown 
in a video recording) using differential attention. Child participants watched a video 
recording in which these two target individuals received unequal attention from two 
bystanders standing between the target individuals. Both bystanders were angled 
toward and preferentially watching the high-status (i.e., prestigious) target for the 
entire duration of the clip, while ignoring the low-status target entirely. No manipu-
lation check was performed, but the authors assumed that observers inferred greater 
status in targets that received more attention. The article in which this manipulation 
was developed has been cited 37 times since its publication in 2012.
</p>
<p>Summary and Conclusions
</p>
<p>In summary, a diversity of measurement instruments and experimental methods 
have been developed for the empirical study of social status. In this chapter, we 
provided an overview of many of these methods to give researchers a sense of 
the available means for assessing different aspects of social status&mdash;from self- and 
other-reports, and behavioral indices&mdash;as well as several of the most frequently 
used and diverse experimental methods for manipulating status.
</p>
<p>Together, these methods contribute to the recent progression and proliferation of 
empirical research on social status, which has become a major topic of scientific in-
vestigation. In spite of these major advances, however, our overview also highlights 
several limitations. First, future research would benefit from focusing more exten-
sively on behavioral indicators of status&mdash;such as the decision-making impact and 
eye-tracking measures highlighted above, which are utilized less frequently than 
the rating scales&mdash;to complement self- and other-reports of status. Prior research 
suggests that even group members&rsquo; perceptions of influence, which is generally 
considered an optimal approach for assessing status, may be distorted by individu-
als&rsquo; everyday beliefs about who is most skilled and deserving of status (Berger and 
Conner 1969), and by the motivation to rationalize the hierarchy that has emerged </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>(Jost and Banaji 1994). For this reason, more objective behavioral measures are 
particularly important.
</p>
<p>A second area for improvement concerns the use of more behavioral-based 
experimental designs. Outside the lab, individuals&rsquo; assessments of their own and 
 others&rsquo; relative status tend to be informed and sustained by patterns of attention, 
deference, and other behavioral exchanges (e.g., complementary postures) among 
group members. Thus, manipulations that directly and systematically vary such 
cues of status&mdash;such as those reviewed above involving attentional, clothing, and 
postural cues&mdash;may provide a way for future researchers to ensure ecological valid-
ity of their findings.
