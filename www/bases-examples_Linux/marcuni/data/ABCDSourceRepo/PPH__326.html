COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
 
</p>
<p>Preface 
The &nbsp;UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook &nbsp;has &nbsp;been &nbsp;prepared &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;&ldquo;Common &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;
Certification &nbsp;Scheme &nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;United &nbsp;Nations &nbsp;(UN)&rdquo; &nbsp;project &nbsp;Task &nbsp;Force &nbsp;and &nbsp;Steering &nbsp;Committee. 
The latter is part of the Inter-Agency Procurement Working Group (IAPWG) Training and 
Certification Sub Working Group. 
 
This Handbook is based on the following publications and documented practices:  
 
 UN Procurement Competence Baseline 
 Common Guidelines for Procurement in the UN System1 
 existing procurement manuals among the various UN organizations  
 known procurement practices in the UN system of organizations 
 third party literature on procurement in the public sector. 
 
Procurement in the UN system is governed by the established regulations and rules of each UN 
organization. While such regulations and rules may differ in matters of detail, all organizations 
are guided by the Common Guidelines for Procurement. These Common Guidelines cover 
procurement stages from sourcing activities that precede a requisition to the execution of a 
procurement contract. They do not cover either the details of procurement, logistics or contract 
implementation matters that may be particular to each UN organization concerned. In addition to 
the &nbsp;Common &nbsp;Guidelines &nbsp;for &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;this &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook &nbsp;was &nbsp;developed. &nbsp;The &nbsp;idea &nbsp;
is to provide a broader picture of the different ways of doing procurement within the UN system. 
Therefore the authors consider it a descriptive synopsis of good practices within the UN system 
rather than a prescriptive document such as the Common Guidelines or existing UN procurement 
manuals.  
 
Disclaimer 
 
This document contains a glossary of procurement-related terms ('Common UN Glossary') which 
was developed by the HLCM Procurement Network working group on Harmonization. The 
Common UN Glossary2 aims to provide a level of consistency across procurement terms in 
common use within the UN System. The Common UN Glossary is intended to assist staff of 
organizations within the UN System in navigating the procurement regulations, rules, handbooks

<p>1.1 The UN System of Organizations 
 
The objective of procurement activities within the UN system is the timely acquisition of goods, 
services and works while addressing the following guiding principles: 
 
 the objectives of the UN organizations concerned 
 fairness, integrity and transparency, through competition 
 economy and effectiveness  
 best value for money.  
 
While all organizations of the UN system have agreed on the above guiding principles, their 
individual procurement is governed by the established regulations and rules of each organization, 
which may differ in matters of detail.  
 
The "UN system of organizations" covers a wide variety of organizational units (centres, 
agencies, organizations, commissions, programmes, etc.) with different institutional and 
functional structures. The principal organs and subsidiary bodies of the UN Secretariat are 
included under the regular budget of the UN, as authorized by the General Assembly. Other 
agencies of the UN system, however, have their own regular budgets or are financed solely from 
voluntary contributions. These latter two categories, moreover, possess a certain degree of 
autonomy (see Annex 1 for an overview of the UN system of organizations). 
 
The organizations within the United Nations system also vary considerably both in size and 
activities. While all organizations spend a certain amount of their budget on administrative 
procurement to establish and run their offices (office furniture, stationary, etc.), their 
procurement activities differ as a result of their mandates and policy goals within the UN system.

</p>
<p>1.2 UN Procurement as a Tool to Advance UN Policy Goals 
 
 
The Millennium Declaration3 and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4  provide a 
framework for the broader goals of individual organizations of the UN system. The Millennium 
Development Goals are: 
 
1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. 
2. Achieve universal primary education. 
3. Promote gender equality and empower women. 
4. Reduce child mortality. 
5. Improve maternal health. 
6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. 
7. Ensure environmental sustainability. 
8. Develop a global partnership for development. 
 
Each organization within the UN system has a certain mandate to contribute to achieving the 
MDGs. While the UN provides peacekeeping operations in areas affected by war, some 
organizations focus on the protection of human rights of children, the development of women, 
fight against HIV/AIDS, hunger, etc. and others provide inter-agency procurement and project 
services. Each of these individual mandates results in the development of mandate specific 
programmes and projects. To implement and realize these programmes and projects the 
organizations require specific goods, services and works.  
 
UN procurement is an essential function to achieve these organizational mandates and in some 
cases it is seen as a model for developing the capacity of recipient governments. In addition to 
efficiently supporting programmes in each of the above areas, procurement can take some of 
these goals into consideration in selecting certain goods or services as well as their suppliers. For 
example: 
 
 UN organizations may develop policies promoting increased opportunities for priority 
</p>
<p>categories of suppliers. Such policies vary by organization, but the most frequent ones are to 
limit the number of suppliers from any single nation and to provide opportunities to suppliers 
from a diverse mix of nations; to provide increased opportunity to offer to suppliers based in 
the country/region where the UN implements its projects. In most cases, such policies provide 
the respective category of suppliers with greater tendering opportunity, but do not provide any 
preference in the evaluation process. Nonetheless, some organizations have adopted procedures 
to explicitly provide a margin of preference for some factors, for example paralleling World 
Bank guidelines permitting up to 15% price preference for local suppliers. 
</p>
<p> 
 UN organizations may seek to support the focus of the MDGs on poverty reduction, gender 
</p>
<p>equality, women empowerment and child education by stipulating in the solicitation 
documents, clauses to this effect and by providing greater representation on shortlists for 
suppliers respecting such goals. For example, contract clauses that prohibit child labour.

<p> UN organizations may accept to implement programmes with funds that include constraints on 
the origin of suppliers or supplies (e.g. some bilateral tied assistance as well as most 
multilateral development loans and grants). Such offers should generally be reviewed to ensure 
that the funds can still be managed according to the general procurement principles otherwise 
applied, and that the eventual procurement will provide an economic and effective solution to 
the requirement for which it has been offered.  
 
</p>
<p>The UN actively promotes good governance in Member States, with particular attention to 
procurement processes and technical assistance. The UN is aware that it also needs to practice 
good governance.

</p>
<p>1.3 Guiding Principles 
In the area of procurement, the guiding principles are based on the concept of stewardship.  
 
 
Stewardship 
 
UN organizations are the stewards of all public funds which have been provided in trust by 
peoples and their governments to fulfil the agreed purposes of the UN. A significant proportion 
of these funds are used through formal procurement processes, for which there are many 
stakeholders &ndash; whether as citizens, suppliers or beneficiaries. These stakeholders need to be 
assured that the funds are being used correctly.  
 
In the past, when most funds went through regular administrative budgets and were spent on 
institutional needs of the organization, procurement accountability was largely the same as 
general management accountability. However, as funds are provided for specific purposes 
outside the daily administration of the institution itself &ndash; humanitarian relief, peacekeeping, 
development, etc. &ndash; the number of stakeholders has grown and the visibility and scrutiny have 
been heightened as the impact of the funds on the daily lives of affected people has greatly 
increased. 
 
Procurement officers are the guardians of the integrity of the procurement process.  They have to 
ensure the funds they have been entrusted with are spent in a professional, correct, fair, timely 
and transparent manner (see Chapter 4, 4.4 Ethics for further details). 
 
 
Guiding Principles 
 
While all organizations have agreed on the following four principles in procurement, sometimes 
minor variations in wording exist in describing the principles of the individual organizations. 
 
 promotion of UN objectives 
 fairness, integrity and transparency through competition 
 economy and effectiveness 
 best value for money. 
 
Promotion of UN objectives 
The ultimate objective of procurement is to add value to the organization in fulfilling its 
mandate, goals and objectives. To a large extent the other three principles contribute to this 
overarching principle, but this principle also includes concepts such as: 
 
 maintain the highest image and reputation of the organization through execution of the 
</p>
<p>procurement process in full conformity with the Financial Regulations and Rules;  
 promote the public good as specified in the mandate of the organization. 
 
Fairness, integrity and transparency, through competition 
Competition conducted in a fair and transparent manner is the heart of procurement in the UN. In 
order for competition to work best, it must guard against collusion and be conducted on the basis 
of clear and appropriate regulations, rules and procedures that are applied consistently to all </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p>

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>potential suppliers. The procurement process should be carried out in a manner that gives all 
interested parties, both inside and outside the organization the assurance that the process is fair.  
 
A transparent system has clear rules and mechanisms to ensure compliance with those rules 
(unbiased specifications, objective evaluation criteria, standard solicitation documents, equal 
information to all parties, confidentiality of offers, etc). Records are open, as appropriate, to 
inspection by auditors; unsuccessful suppliers can be briefed on the strengths and weaknesses of 
their own offers. Transparency ensures that any deviations from fair and equal treatment are 
detected very early, and makes such deviations less likely to occur. It thus protects the integrity 
of the process and the interest of the organization. 
 
Economy and effectiveness 
Economy &nbsp;and &nbsp;effectiveness &nbsp;means &nbsp;providing &nbsp;an &nbsp;appropriate &nbsp;solution &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;need &nbsp;
with regards to quantity, quality and timeliness at the right price. It also means ensuring that the 
overall cost to the organization in conducting the procurement process is minimized in the 
interests of the overall budget of the organization. Economy protects the interest of the budget 
owner, while effectiveness ensures the interest of the end-user is met. 
 
Best value for money 
Best value for money means selecting offers which present the optimum combination of factors 
such as appropriate quality, life-cycle costs and other parameters which can include social, 
environmental or other strategic objectives which meet the end-user needs. Best value does not 
necessarily mean the lowest initial price option, but rather represents the best return on the 
investment, taking into consideration the evaluation criteria in the specified solicitation 
documents. 
 
Potential conflicts among the guiding principles 
While together the principles provide a common framework underlying UN procurement, 
individual principles may conflict in some situations, requiring professional and management 
experience, and judgement, to achieve the correct balance. Some examples are provided below: 
 
 The &nbsp;&ldquo;interest &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rdquo; &nbsp;may &nbsp;be &nbsp;more &nbsp;emphasized &nbsp;than &nbsp;the &nbsp;principles &nbsp;of &nbsp;competition &nbsp;
</p>
<p>and economy in a particular procurement transaction, for example, during humanitarian 
emergencies. In fact, organizations involved in emergency relief are often faced with the 
limitations of procedures originally established to control standard office procurement, and 
have sought to develop procedures better adapted to unforeseen emergency situations. This 
involves overriding some standard processes to enable urgent action. It is essential that steps 
taken and reasons for taking them are well documented. Procurement officers should assume 
that such decisions are reviewed and audited after the fact, and ensure they will stand up to 
scrutiny. 
</p>
<p> 
 The interest of the organization may also cause the UN to explicitly consider factors which are 
</p>
<p>otherwise extraneous to the immediate procurement: geographic distribution, support to small 
and medium enterprises, support to women-owned businesses, environmental sustainability, 
curbing child labour and production of landmines, etc. This may require additional resources 
and effort to qualify potential suppliers. 
</p>
<p> 
 UN goals of broadening participation in solicitations, particularly to disadvantaged groups, 
</p>
<p>may benefit from smaller lots to increase local interest. It may require use of additional </p>

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>procurement resources for active market research, including outreach to find appropriate 
potential suppliers not previously on the roster, and evaluation of extra offers. This should be 
accepted as part of the normal process. 
</p>
<p> 
 Open competitive tendering for an international organization may conflict with economical use 
</p>
<p>of administrative resources and effectiveness of completing solicitations in a reasonable period. 
Organizations may address this through short listing procedures, whereby the higher the 
expected contract value the larger the number of invitees on the shortlist. In addition, 
advertisement of tendering opportunities is done in an open and international manner so to still 
be able to address the principle of openness in competition. 
</p>
<p> 
 Open competition may conflict with recommended practice of establishing strategic long term 
</p>
<p>partnerships. The competitive principle is normally understood to argue for placing each 
requirement out to tender solicitation, risking disruption when changing suppliers. Some UN 
organizations have concluded that their Financial Regulations and Rules (FRR) permit entering 
in to long term framework agreements on a non-exclusive basis as the result of a competitive 
solicitation. This permits assurance of uninterrupted supply at competitive prices and the 
development of a closer quality assurance and working relationship. 
</p>
<p> 
 Transparency in UN procurement may require added effort by preparing solicitation documents 
</p>
<p>with detailed criteria for evaluation and the tender process. Also the fairness and competition 
principles require broad advertisement which increase costs and supplier preparation resulting 
in transparency and fairness that may go against effectiveness. 
</p>
<p> 
Procurement officers and those acting in or supporting the procurement function are in a special 
position of trust and must uphold high standards of professionalism to be able to fulfil the above 
requirements.

<p>1.4 Administrative Framework: Financial Regulations and 
Rules (FRR) and Procurement Procedures 
 
Introduction 
 
The Financial Regulations and Rules (FRR) of each organization provide the framework for the 
administrative context within which procurement is carried out, as specified in its respective 
procurement procedures.  
 
The FRR specify key guidelines for procurement, types of procurement instruments and 
evaluations, primacy of competitive tendering while recognizing situations in which that may not 
be in the best interest of the organization. The FRR vary among organizations, and the nuances 
are important for the work in each organization. The FRR provide for delegation of authority to 
increase the operational responsiveness of the procurement function, while also requiring 
segregation of duties to ensure control, and accountability for the correct (or improper) use of the 
authority and resources available. 
 
While the general &nbsp;principles &nbsp;are &nbsp;similar, &nbsp;FRR &nbsp;wording &nbsp;differs &nbsp;as &nbsp;do &nbsp;the &nbsp;organizations&rsquo; &nbsp;
procurement procedures and thresholds for their application.  Differences are being reduced 
through the UN procurement reform process. 
 
 
Content of FRR 
 
The FRR and procurement procedures (which some agencies have assembled into procurement 
manuals) specify the solicitation procedures for supply of goods, services, or works. They 
include appropriate methods for evaluating and selecting awardees and possible contracts. FRR 
clearly state the principle of selection through competitive tendering. They also indicate 
conditions which might justify waiving the competitive tendering process in favour of direct 
contracting where that would be in the interest of the organization, so long as justification is 
supported by clear evidence that tendering would not provide an effective solution. FRR may 
permit a UN organization to procure on a collaborative basis, i.e. on the basis of solicitations and 
arrangements established by another UN organization. 
 
No financial commitment without budget availability 
The FRR and procurement procedures stipulate that the procurement process should only begin 
once an approved and budgeted requisition has been received. Nonetheless, those organizations 
faced with special exigencies in field operations, often tolerate initiation of internal procurement 
processes including issuance of solicitations before formal receipt of an approved and budgeted 
requisition. In such exceptional circumstances, whenever solicitations are issued in advance of 
budget &nbsp;availability, &nbsp;potential &nbsp;suppliers &nbsp;should &nbsp;always &nbsp;be &nbsp;informed &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;solicitation &nbsp;is &nbsp;&ldquo;in &nbsp;
anticipation&rdquo; &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;requirement, &nbsp;but &nbsp;that &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;will &nbsp;only &nbsp;proceed &nbsp;when &nbsp;full &nbsp;authorization &nbsp;
has been received. While signature of the eventual contract and corresponding creation of a 
financial commitment should clearly wait until receipt of the approved and budgeted requisition, 
internal preparation of specifications and solicitation documents could be considered as part of 
procurement planning; nonetheless, issuance of the solicitation documents at that early time 
requires a specific management decision in all cases.

</p>
<p>Segregation of duties 
UN organizations have generally developed an administrative structure based on segregation (or 
in some cases separation) of responsibilities for procurement. This structure typically recognises 
that the requisitioner, budget controller, buyer and payer should be separate, in order to provide 
appropriate organizational checks and balances and to permit specialisation in their respective 
professional areas. The main purpose is to reduce the possibility of corruption and to emphasize 
accountability of all key players in the procurement process. 
 
Delegation of authority 
As specified in their respective FRR, UN organizations have established delegations of authority 
to implement procurement activities. Such delegations are intended to reduce administrative 
bottlenecks and provide increased responsiveness by locating decision making authority nearer 
to the activity. Of relevance to procurement are both the financial and procurement delegations 
of authority, although only the procurement delegation is discussed here. The procurement 
delegation provides authorisation to award and/or sign a contract and/or issue payment upon 
confirmation that the correct procedures have been followed. By exercising the authority, the 
staff member becomes accountable for the action and potentially financially liable for error 
(misconduct). Delegations are generally made at one of the following levels: 
 
</p>
<p>Level Delegations &nbsp;up &nbsp;to &nbsp;a &nbsp;maximum &nbsp;level&hellip; 
1 Of petty expenditure for small purchases. 
2 For which RFQ procedures apply. 
3 Not &nbsp;requiring &nbsp;review &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;Contracts &nbsp;Review &nbsp;Committee. 
4 Requiring review by the organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;Contracts &nbsp;Review &nbsp;Committee. 
5 Of higher financial authority in very large programmes with experienced

<p>staff. 
 
Note: Not all UN organizations use all levels.

<p>1.5 UN Procurement Reform  
 
Introduction 
 
Procurement at the UN has undergone significant transformation since reforms were initiated in 
1999. The main issues taken into consideration as part of the UN procurement reform can be 
found in several UN official documents, particularly Resolution A/RES/54/14 of 22 November 
1999. The Resolution specifies the direction that procurement reform initiatives need to follow in 
order to strengthen the principles of transparency, effectiveness and efficiency while also fully 
reflecting the international character of the United Nations.  
 
 
Reform initiatives 
 
Specific reform initiatives include: 
 
 Increased opportunities to suppliers from developing countries and countries with economies in 
</p>
<p>transition; wider participation of suppliers from all Member States in general; and 
improvement of communication with suppliers; improvement of system for registration of 
suppliers. 
</p>
<p> More transparent, open, impartial and cost-effective procurement process, based on 
competitive tendering. 
</p>
<p> Increased use of modern electronic means of communication to disseminate information 
regarding requests for proposals, invitations to bid and requests for expression of interest; 
</p>
<p> Assurance that bids received through electronic means are not compromised. 
 increased transparency of procurement decisions; and maintenance of the principle of 
</p>
<p>separation of responsibilities  of the requisitioning and approving officers. 
 Improved use of acquisition planning. 
 Enhanced professionalism of procurement practitioners through increased training. 
 Improved cooperation and common rules and regulations. 
 Increased field support. 
 Enhanced accountability through greater delegation of authority. 
 
 
Working groups 
 
Procurement reform is supported from the highest level, and carried out at both the 
organizational and inter-agency level. The following two working groups have been established 
to harmonize and streamline procurement practices and to increase efficiency in procurement 
throughout the UN system of organizations: 
 
 Inter-Agency Procurement Working Group (IAPWG)  
 Common Services Working Group on Procurement. 
 
The IAPWG was established in 1976 and is an informal group of senior procurement officers. 
Twenty-six organizations participate in the meetings, including a representative from the </p>

</p>
<p>UN/OLA. The IAPWG leadership mechanism is through a rotational Chair/Vice-Chair. UNDP, 
through IAPSO, is the permanent Secretariat of the IAPWG. 
 
The Common Services Working Group on Procurement forms part of the Task Force on 
Common Services, chaired by the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services, and 
was created within that forum in 1997. Based in New York, its members are the UN Secretariat, 
UNDP, UNFPA, UNOPS, UNICEF, WFP and a representative from OLA. Initiatives of the 
Working Group are disseminated to Geneva, Copenhagen and Vienna and other offices away 
from Headquarters.  
 
 
Achievements 
 
In addition to strengthened cooperation in procurement among the UN organizations, the 
following achievements have been reached: 
 
 Development of Common Guidelines on Procurement (incorporated within the Secretary-
General&rsquo;s &nbsp;reform initiative into common financial regulations and rules on procurement); 
including the adoption of a new procurement principle: best value for money. 
</p>
<p> 
 Common financial regulations and rules on procurement (adopted by UNDP, UNFPA and 
</p>
<p>UN). 
 
 Improved communications; Communities of Practice Network on specific procurement themes 
</p>
<p>where members exchange procurement information. 
 
 Common training initiatives and agreement on the common training and certification 
</p>
<p>programme to promote procurement professionalism. 
 
 Establishment of the United Nations Global Marketplace (UNGM) as a common electronic 
</p>
<p>portal for supplier registration and procurement opportunities, including a simplified common 
registration form to all UN entities who are members of the UNGM. 
</p>
<p> 
 Mechanism for sharing Long-Term Agreements or system contracts; and provision of 
</p>
<p>procurement services between the different organizations. 
 
 Enhanced procurement hardware and software systems within UN organizations and in some 
</p>
<p>cases new joint ERP procurement modules have been implemented. 
 
 UN organizations have embraced the practice of "lead agencies" for certain commodities, 
</p>
<p>entering into global and local "lead agency" agreements and engaging in "lead agency" supplier 
evaluations.

</p>
<p>Benefits 
 
Lead agency cooperation has provided UN organizations with the following benefits: 
 
 improved individual organization's specialisation  
 improved discounts based on combined volume 
 reduced cost due to economies of scale 
 reduced maverick buying 
 increased control over the procurement process 
 eliminated non value added tasks 
 reduced long purchase-to-pay cycle time 
 reduced transaction cost; and, increased total procurement. 
 
These and other procurement reform efforts were validated by independent reviews in 2005. In 
2006 the Secretary General has ordered a comprehensive review of internal and financial 
controls to further identify reform opportunities in procurement.

<p>1.6 Procurement as a UN Profession 
 
Introduction 
 
Procurement is an internationally recognised profession. It has evolved from a simple buying 
function to become recognised as a professional role within the UN as well. Procurement officers 
and those acting in, or supporting that function, are in a special position of trust and are held to 
high standards of professionalism. Development of professional and ethical competencies of UN 
procurement officers is recognised as an important component of the UN procurement reform 
process. 
 
Procurement officers operate within a complex environment. They are subject to pressure from 
end-users seeking rapid response or a specific technical solution, from suppliers seeking 
invitations or contracts, from donor representatives or the public seeking explanation for the use 
of the funds, and by anyone who thinks they detect a lack of transparency or other weakness in 
the process. 
 
 
UN common procurement certification programme 
 
The UN Common Procurement Certification Programme was created by several UN 
organizations. its aim is to clarify the professional nature of the procurement function, and to 
provide the basis for systematic training in technical and procedural knowledge as well as 
professional and ethical behaviour for UN procurement officers.  
 
The &nbsp;Professional &nbsp;Competencies &nbsp;and &nbsp;this &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook &nbsp;contain &nbsp;the &nbsp;basic &nbsp;common &nbsp;
technical and procedural knowledge expected of UN procurement officers, to be complemented 
by specific knowledge of regulations, rules and procedures of each organization. 
 
Heightened professionalism of UN procurement officers is the basis for increased delegation of 
authority and corresponding accountability that are central to the current UN procurement reform 
process. The current training and certification effort is an important element in this, as are the 
increased training efforts of each UN organization.

<p>2.1 Responsibilities and Process 
 
Introduction 
 
In all UN organizations, procurement has an impact on the overall organizational outcomes and 
results. It is therefore good practice to undertake strategic planning of procurement at the 
organizational level in order to link procurement activities and priorities to the overall priorities 
of the organization. Strategic planning is also important in order to manage the risks and the total 
costs involved in procurement, including use of resources. 
 
 
Responsibility 
 
Development of organizational procurement strategy is normally the responsibility of senior 
management of the organization, in particular, the Chief Procurement Officer. However it would 
be done in collaboration with other senior management and with the support of procurement and 
other officials in undertaking the various analyses. Usually it is in line with the normal 
organizational business planning cycle. For most organizations this process is performed on 
either an annual or biennial basis. 
 
Process 
 
An organizational procurement strategy is developed through a process of reviewing and 
analysing the organization&rsquo;s: 
 
 mandate, strategic direction and objectives  
 procurement portfolio 
 procurement function and capability. 
 
On the basis of this review and analysis the strategic procurement objectives for the organization 
can be identified and an organizational procurement strategy developed and implemented. The 
final stage would be to measure the results to see if the objectives have been achieved.  Each 
stage in the process is shown in the flow chart below.

<p>2.2 Reviewing the Organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;Mandate &nbsp;and &nbsp;Strategy 
 
The ultimate objective of procurement is to add value to the organization in fulfilling its goals 
and objectives. Procurement activities support organizational mandates on a daily basis by 
obtaining the necessary inputs for the organization to do its work.  
 
The guiding principle in developing the procurement strategy is to ensure that it is fully aligned 
with the overall mandate and strategy of the organization. Therefore, before embarking on the 
development of a procurement &nbsp;strategy, &nbsp;it &nbsp;is &nbsp;important &nbsp;to &nbsp;review &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;mandate &nbsp;and &nbsp;
strategy. The form of the strategy varies from organization to organization and in some cases 
may involve reviewing a variety of material and documents including business plans, strategic 
communications from senior management and so on.

<p>2.3 Analysing the Procurement Portfolio and Developing a 
Procurement Profile 
 
Introduction 
 
The purpose of analysing the procurement portfolio is to develop a full and comprehensive 
picture (procurement profile) of the procurement needs of the organisation. The first step is to 
analyse past and projected procurement expenditure or spend for goods, services and works 
(spend analysis). The next step is to analyse the difficulty and risk associated with securing these 
goods, services and works (risk analysis). The third step is to develop a procurement profile that 
identifies past and projected procurement expenditure and associated levels of risk in form of a 
matrix. Finally, appropriate strategies can be developed for each of the categories of this 
procurement profile. 
 
 
Spend analysis 
 
The first question to ask when preparing a spend analysis is whether historic spending data is a 
good indicator of future spends. To establish this it is necessary to ask various questions such as: 
 
 Were there special events affecting the historic spend that will not be repeated, e.g. a natural 
</p>
<p>disaster or large scale project that caused a large, but temporary increase in spend? 
 Are there anticipated special events that will affect future spend, e.g. a forthcoming large scale 
</p>
<p>project? 
 Are there events happening in the external environment that are likely to affect the spend 
</p>
<p>profile, e.g. political or economic changes in the programme country or in the behaviour of the 
donor community? 
</p>
<p> Are there strategic organizational issues that are likely to affect spend, e.g. changes in the 
funding profile or in the priorities of the organization? 
</p>
<p> 
If, as a result of this analysis the conclusion is the historic spend will provide a reasonably 
accurate &nbsp;prediction &nbsp;of &nbsp;future &nbsp;spend, &nbsp;the &nbsp;next &nbsp;step &nbsp;is &nbsp;to &nbsp;undertake &nbsp;a &nbsp;&lsquo;spend &nbsp;analysis&rsquo;.  
 
Analysing procurement spend provides data that can be used as a baseline to measure 
improvements, but also to provide reliable data for deciding strategies to realize short and long 
term savings. Various tools are available to conduct a spend analysis, but normally the first step 
is to download data from the financial management system, most usually the Accounts Payable. 
Data should include all invoices that have passed through the system within the specified time 
period. This data can then be analysed using parameters relevant for the particular organization, 
but typical parameters could include: 
 
 spend and number of transactions per commodity or category 
 number of suppliers per commodity or category 
 average purchase order value 
 total expenditure per supplier 
 transaction distribution by dollar range (e.g. less than USD 1000, USD 1000 &ndash; 2500 etc) 
 spending distribution between main clients 
 spend and number of transactions per procurement officers </p>

<p> 
Chapter 2: Organizational Procurement Strategy  Page 2-6 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p> number of procurement officers involved in the transaction per commodity group. 
 
Special factors 
Where special factors may indicate that the historic spend analysis will not be a good predictor 
of future spend, in most circumstances it would still be relevant to conduct a spend analysis and 
then adjust the results taking into consideration the special factors. 
 
If there are factors involved that imply that the historic data does not provide any relevance in 
predicting future data, then the procurement profile would need to be constructed by analysing as 
much data as possible from information on the future strategies, and activities of the organization 
such as project plans, budgets and so on. 
 
The resulting procurement profile should provide as comprehensive a picture as possible of the 
actual procurement spend including: 
 
 what goods, services and works are purchased and how much is spent on them 
 comparison of historic spend on each item with the projected spend 
 how the goods, services and works are purchased 
 who the goods, services and works are purchased from 
 the geographical location of suppliers e.g. local, regional, international. 
 
 
Risk analysis  
 
Risk analysis should look at the following issues: 
 
 how critical the goods, services or works are to the organization 
 The difficulty and risk associated with securing the goods, services and works. 
 the risk associated with each commodity or category based on: 
 risk specific to the goods, services or works 
 organization related risk 
 supplier related risk 
 market related risk. 
</p>
<p> 
When analysing supply risk the following key risk factors need to be analysed for each 
commodity or category: 
 
 nature of the supply market 
 probability of supply failure 
 strategic importance to the organization 
 impact on the organization of supply failure 
 complexity of the procurement relationship.

</p>
<p>Characteristics of risk level, spend categories and possible strategies 
The typical characteristics of each of these categories and possible strategies for dealing with 
them are highlighted in the table below: 
 
</p>
<p>Category Typical characteristics Possible strategies 
Routine 
(Low risk and 
low spend) 
</p>
<p> Usually low value and low volume 
items. 
</p>
<p> Represent routine procurement 
processing. 
</p>
<p> Typically represent up to 90% of 
the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;suppliers 
</p>
<p> Often the suppliers are small 
businesses. 
</p>
<p> Transaction costs can be greater 
than the value of the items 
themselves. 
</p>
<p> Generally competitive local supply 
markets for these items. 
</p>
<p>Minimize administrative efforts by: 
 Procurement at the lowest 
</p>
<p>practical level (decentralized). 
 Encouraging local suppliers to 
</p>
<p>view the organization as a 
valuable client resulting in lower 
transaction costs. 
</p>
<p> Focussing ordering and payment 
terms with suppliers on 
transaction efficiency (direct 
debiting, aggregation of orders, 
monthly accounts, payment cards, 
etc). 
</p>
<p>Leverage 
(Low risk and 
high spend) 
 
</p>
<p> Commodities commonly used 
across the entire organization with 
high volume. 
</p>
<p> Represent commodities where 
there is potential for reduction of 
inventory management, handling 
and storage costs. 
</p>
<p> Mature and competitive supply 
markets. 
</p>
<p> Markets are served by a few 
suppliers with extensive 
distribution networks. 
</p>
<p>Total cost reduction and high 
service levels from suppliers by: 
 Establishing automated supplier 
</p>
<p>interfaces to minimize process 
related costs for high volume 
standard goods; 
</p>
<p> Ensuring regular management 
information reports on the nature 
of this expenditure to keep 
strategic focus; 
</p>
<p> Establishing long term agreements 
to simplify procurement, coupled 
with automated paying systems 
</p>
<p> Regionalising supply by using 
local suppliers that are agents for 
centralized arrangements; 
</p>
<p> Forming collaborative initiatives 
with other organizations to build 
leverage, target off-peak periods 
in supply markets. 
</p>
<p>Bottleneck 
(High risk and 
low spend) 
</p>
<p> Highly specialized goods, services 
or works. 
</p>
<p> Procurement is often undertaken 
by technical experts rather than 
procurement professionals.  
</p>
<p> Technical specifications are 
inappropriately detailed and limit 
the supply base. 
</p>
<p> Often there are only a few potential 
suppliers 
 
</p>
<p>Reduce the organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;market &nbsp;
vulnerability and to secure ongoing 
supply by: 
 Identifying alternative sources of 
</p>
<p>supply and/or substitute goods or 
services. 
</p>
<p> Holding extra stock where 
possible reduces risk. 
</p>
<p> Developing supplier capabilities 
and/or changing demand 
requirements. </p>

</p>
<p>Category Typical characteristics Possible strategies 
 Usually there are only a few 
</p>
<p>transactions in this category. 
 Ensuring long term agreements 
</p>
<p>may secure supply from key 
suppliers. 
</p>
<p> Encouraging new supply 
participants into the market; 
</p>
<p> Considering local supplier 
development strategies. 
</p>
<p> Developing contingency plans to 
deal with potential disruptions to 
supply. 
</p>
<p> Developing performance or 
functional specifications to ensure 
a wider sourcing base. 
</p>
<p> Developing a mixture of technical 
expertise and procurement skills 
to manage supply. 
</p>
<p>Strategic 
(High risk and 
high spend) 
</p>
<p> Represents goods, services or 
works that are critical to the 
organization. 
</p>
<p> It &nbsp;is &nbsp;often &nbsp;a &nbsp;complex &nbsp;&ldquo;bundle&rdquo; &nbsp;or &nbsp;
&ldquo;package&rdquo; &nbsp;of &nbsp;goods &nbsp;and &nbsp;associated &nbsp;
services 
</p>
<p> Requires innovative solutions and 
high level expertise from suppliers. 
</p>
<p> The &nbsp;suppliers&rsquo; &nbsp;attitude &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;
organization (whether or not they 
consider the organization valued 
customers) had a high impact on 
the value and quality of the goods, 
services or works delivered. 
</p>
<p> The category represents very few 
transactions and there are often 
very few suppliers available.  
</p>
<p> The costs in offering contracts are 
substantial for both the procuring 
organization and the supplier. 
</p>
<p>Manage relationship and 
performance through regimes and 
systems which are essential to 
secure value for money and reduce 
risk by: 
 Encouraging effective supplier 
</p>
<p>relationship management for 
complex and costly bundles of 
goods and services. 
</p>
<p> Understanding correctly supplier 
needs and agree to performance 
management criteria and 
interfaces. 
</p>
<p> Maintaining regular 
communication with suppliers to 
ensure innovation and continuous 
service level improvements. 
</p>
<p> encouraging local suppliers with 
an incentive to deliver long term 
value rather than suppliers for 
which the business is not 
significant. 
</p>
<p> Helping &nbsp;to &nbsp;develop &nbsp;suppliers&rsquo; &nbsp;
performance levels. 
</p>
<p> 
Note: Procurement falling into the leverage, bottleneck and strategic categories would be 
considered &nbsp;&ldquo;significant &nbsp;purchases&rdquo;. &nbsp;Once &nbsp;this &nbsp;stage &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;process &nbsp;is &nbsp;completed, &nbsp;there &nbsp;will &nbsp;be &nbsp;a &nbsp;
clear &nbsp;picture &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;portfolio.

To complete the analysis it is also necessary to look at the procurement function and capability 
in parallel to the analysis of the procurement portfolio. This analysis includes: 
 
 roles, responsibilities, structure and reporting 
 procurement systems and processes 
 procurement skills and capacities. 
 
In all three cases it is important that they are appropriate in terms of matching the procurement 
portfolio. 
 
Aspects of procurement functions 
 
Aspects of the procurement functions and typical features to be analysed are listed in the table 
below: 
Aspects Features to be analysed

<p>2.5 Identifying Strategic Procurement Objectives 
Once the analytical phase is completed the next stage in developing the procurement strategy is 
to identify strategic procurement objectives. These should include: 
 
 Procurement objectives for each category of goods, services and works on the supply 
</p>
<p>positioning matrix. 
 Objectives for significant purchases (purchases falling into the leverage, bottleneck and 
</p>
<p>strategic categories on the supply positioning matrix.). 
 Objectives for the management of the procurement function. 
 
 
Objectives for each category of goods, services and works 
 
Objectives for the procurement of each category of goods, services and works should be made 
based on the procurement portfolio using the four procurement categories. The full results of the 
earlier analyses should be used as input.  The table below shows some typical/general objectives 
and examples of some solutions for each segment of the procurement matrix.

</p>
<p> 
Note: The solutions will vary from organization to organization depending on their procurement 
profile. 
 
Objectives for significant purchases 
 
Specific strategic objectives for significant purchases would be included if they were critical for 
the organization, e.g. the impending procurement of an organization-wide Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) implementation or a high risk commodity critical to a core strategic objective of 
the organization. The process for developing objectives for significant purchases is covered in 
more detail in Unit 3.1 Individual Procurement Planning. 
 
Procurement management objectives 
 
Procurement management objectives should also be developed using the results of the analysis of 
the procurement function and capability. These should relate to the objectives defined for each 
category of goods, works and services and also for any specific, critical and/or significant </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>purchases. These objectives can relate to the roles, responsibilities, structure and reporting, the 
procurement systems and capacities and/or the procurement skills and capacities.  These 
objectives therefore will vary from organization to organization and also within a specific 
organization and can vary from year to year. Examples of specific objectives could be: 
 
 increase coordination of common user items across the organization 
 introduce new e-procurement system(s) 
 implement ISO 9001 
 increase numbers of procurement officers with Certification. 
 
 
2.6 &nbsp;Developing &nbsp;and &nbsp;Implementing &nbsp;the &nbsp;Organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;
Procurement Strategy 
 
Once detailed objectives have been agreed, and using the current status as a basis, a strategy can 
be developed which outlines how the objectives are going to be achieved. This should include an 
implementation plan which identifies activities, timeframes and responsible officers. In some 
cases the implementation plan may include large-scale initiatives that in themselves are 
&ldquo;projects&rdquo; &nbsp;requiring &nbsp;project &nbsp;managers, &nbsp;budgets &nbsp;and &nbsp;so &nbsp;on. &nbsp; 
 
 
2.7 Measuring Results 
 
A framework needs to be put in place to measure whether the procurement strategy objectives 
have been met. Performance measurement is important in order to aid probity and accountability 
and also to identify strengths and weaknesses in the procurement function, and therefore areas 
for development. Measures or key performance indicators (KPIs) should be developed that are 
relevant, specific, agreed with relevant stakeholders, and within the control of the organization. 
Performance measures should also relate to specific strategies or key processes. 
 
 
Benchmarking 
 
Benchmarking with other procurement organizations either within or outside the UN system can 
be useful for collecting data and measuring performance. However there are difficulties with 
implementing benchmarking such as, sharing confidential information and ensuring that like is 
compared with like. For example, comparing the number of procurement officers per 
procurement volume or cost per order between organizations would not normally be relevant 
unless both organizations had identical procurement portfolios.

</p>
<p>Performance measures 
 
Examples of performance measures are listed in the table below:

</p>
<p> Level/amount of savings/cost reductions achieved. 
 Reduction of stockholdings. 
 Reduction in demand. 
 Number &nbsp;of &nbsp;&ldquo;stock-outs&rdquo;. 
 Number of goods rejected. 
 Increased use of alternatives. 
</p>
<p>Supplier management 
 
</p>
<p> Number &nbsp;of &nbsp;&ldquo;new&rdquo; &nbsp;suppliers &nbsp;involved &nbsp;in &nbsp;competition. 
 Number of late/damaged/inadequate deliveries. 
 Level of quality achieved. 
</p>
<p>Efficiency of internal systems 
and processes 
</p>
<p> Volume of low value transactions. 
 Usage of aggregated arrangements or long term agreements. 
 Reduction in transaction cost. 
 Internal customer satisfaction. 
</p>
<p>Procurement management  
 
</p>
<p> % of procurement officers certified. 
 Number of staff days for training. 
</p>
<p> 
 
Tools 
 
Some UN organizations have implemented tools and systems to support all or part of this 
process. A number are using strategy implementation tools such as the Balanced Scorecard&copy; 
which supports the process of setting objectives and measuring performance. Other organizations 
have designed their own tools. In some organizations this is a separate process for the 
procurement function, while in others performance measuring will be integrated into the overall 
organizational strategic management system.

</p>
<p>3.1 Operational Procurement Planning  
Introduction 
 
The ultimate goal of procurement planning is coordinated and integrated action to fulfil a need 
for goods, services or works in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost. Early and accurate 
planning is essential to avoid last minute, emergency or ill-planned procurement, which is 
contrary to open, efficient and effective &ndash; and consequently transparent &ndash; procurement.  In 
addition, most potential savings in the procurement process are achieved by improvements in the 
planning stages. Even in situations where planning is difficult such as emergencies, proactive 
measures can be taken to ensure contingency planning and be better prepared to address 
upcoming procurement requests. For example: 
 
 Advance identification of suitable suppliers of potential products frequently requested in 
</p>
<p>emergency operations, including confirmation by suppliers on willingness to respond on short 
notice. 
</p>
<p> Development of standard specifications/TOR/SOW for products/services/works requested in 
emergency operations. 
</p>
<p> 
Good procurement planning is essential to optimize the contribution of the procurement function 
towards achieving the overall goals of the organization. It supports: 
 
 Transparency. 
 Development of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) according to milestones and 
</p>
<p>accountabilities set in the procurement plan, and use of the same to monitor performance. 
 Effective and timely solicitation of offers, award of contracts and delivery of the goods, 
</p>
<p>services and works required. 
 Early requisition to reduce any delays in procurement and timely delivery to project sites. 
 Early identification of right commodities and quantities to meet programme needs. 
 Sourcing the right suppliers on time to avoid cutting corners under rush procurement to meet 
</p>
<p>deadlines or budget expenditure. 
 Effective supply strategy and timely programme and project implementation. 
 Avoidance of unnecessary exigencies and urgencies, enabling full competition and full 
</p>
<p>compliance with standard rules and procedures. 
 Sufficient time to fully explore alternative procurement approaches, such as joint bidding with 
</p>
<p>other organizations and use of LTAs of others. 
 Strengthened procurement power vis-&agrave;-vis suppliers. 
 Obtaining best prices for aggregate requirements. 
 Establishment of criteria to measure effectiveness of the procurement function. 
 Systematic and procedurally correct procurements. 
 Development of long term agreements. 
 
Procurement planning clarifies what is needed and when it is needed to both user and buyer. 
Effective procurement planning enables the UN organization and its staff to work smoothly to 
achieve &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;goals &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;right &nbsp;quality &nbsp;and &nbsp;quantity &nbsp;of &nbsp;inputs &nbsp;in &nbsp;place;; &nbsp;ineffective &nbsp;
procurement planning may result in failure to achieve those goals, putting in jeopardy the FRR 
and procurement principles and causing damage to the credibility of the organization.

</p>
<p> 
In this unit 
This unit describes the following two types of procurement planning: 
 
 consolidated procurement plans 
 individual procurement planning. 
 
 
Consolidated procurement plans 
 
Consolidated procurement plans are often developed for the whole organization, but depending 
on the structure and level of decentralisation these may be developed at the corporate, divisional, 
country office or business unit level &ndash; or even at a number of these levels.  
 
Responsibility 
At the organizational level the responsibility for preparing the plan would normally lie with the 
authority responsible for procurement policy and planning, but in smaller business units it may 
lie with the procurement officer. Consolidated procurement plans would normally be prepared 
annually, but in some environments where the needs are more difficult to define, e.g. because 
business focus is on emergency relief or on procurement agency services, these may be done 
more frequently, though not normally more than quarterly.  
 
The procurement plan is always based on estimates of procurement operations to be carried out 
in the specified period. Some procurement needs cannot be anticipated, and the plans can 
therefore never be accurate. However, a procurement plan based on estimates is still better than 
no procurement plan.  
 
Information sources 
The information for the procurement plan should be collected by the responsible person from a 
variety of sources depending on the particular organization. In some cases the information can be 
collected by asking requisitioners and clients to complete questionnaires, while in other cases the 
information can be collected through Management Information Systems or ERPs. Typically the 
information is collected from requisitioners, clients, project plans, forecasting systems and lists 
of expiring LTAs.  
 
Data collected varies from organization to organization, but as a minimum would include: 
 
 expected requirement for goods/services/works 
 quantities 
 delivery time requirements 
 estimated budget. 
 
Consolidation 
Once this data has been collected from all the appropriate sources it should be consolidated into 
the overall procurement plan. Analysis of the plan provides an opportunity to identify potential 
consolidation of procurements to achieve economies of scale, to better utilize resources, and to 
provide an overview of the magnitude of the procurement activity. In addition, when used as a 
management tool, plans can identify periods of time in which a large percentage of procurement 
actions are required. This information can assist in planning and distribution of workload 
between various projects and operational units.  </p>

</p>
<p>  
Good practice 
It is good practice to publish these consolidated procurement plans, for example on the 
organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;website. &nbsp;This &nbsp;provides &nbsp;advance &nbsp;information &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;outside &nbsp;world &nbsp;of &nbsp;upcoming &nbsp;
procurement activities and advances the key principle of transparency in procurement. 
 
 
Individual procurement plans 
 
Once a requisition or project plan is received determining an actual requirement, the 
procurement officer is then responsible for developing the individual procurement plan. The 
scope of the individual procurement plan will depend on the complexity of the requirement. 
While it is good practice to always make a plan, in the case of low risk/low spend requirements 
the plan should be simple, but should include an overview of the necessary steps of the process 
and associated timeline. At the other end of the scale, managing the procurement of an extremely 
high risk/high spend requirement is in fact project management and should entail a thorough and 
comprehensive planning process.  
 
Responsibility 
It is the responsibility of the procurement officer to ensure that an appropriate level of 
procurement planning is conducted depending on the particular requirement. 
 
Significant purchases 
Particular &nbsp;focus &nbsp;needs &nbsp;to &nbsp;be &nbsp;made &nbsp;in &nbsp;developing &nbsp;plans &nbsp;for &nbsp;&ldquo;significant &nbsp;purchases&rdquo;. &nbsp;Significant &nbsp;
purchases are those goods, services of works that have been identified as being of high relative 
expenditure and/or are difficult to secure (see Unit 2.5 for details on objectives for significant 
purchases). An example of a significant purchase could be one annual purchase valued at USD 1 
million, such as a complex consulting assignment. Alternatively it could be a large number of 
low value purchases within one year, which could be more economically addressed through an 
LTA.

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p> 
Identification of desired procurement outcomes and objectives 
 
The first step in the planning process is to identify the desired outcomes and objectives of the 
procurement. However the process is not necessarily linear. In some cases information obtained 
in the informational gathering stage will also have an impact on the identification of objectives. 
For example, an analysis of the supply market shows that there are limited sources of supply 
which means that a key objective is to identify suppliers who can develop alternative products. 
This, in turn, will have an impact on the requirement definition stage of the process.  
 
The complexity of this process will vary from case to case. In some instances, for example where 
the requirement is for a commodity used across the organization with high volume, e.g. vehicles, 
the objectives and the desired outcomes of the procurement action may already be clearly 
defined &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;strategy. &nbsp;In &nbsp;other &nbsp;instances, &nbsp;such as the procurement 
of a complex and high value solution that is critical to the organization or the client, then there 
may be a complex network of stakeholders each with their own ideas of objectives and desired 
outcomes. 
 
Stakeholders 
Where the situation is complex it can be a good idea to systematically analyse the stakeholders 
involved. Stakeholders are anyone who has an interest in procurement activities delivering actual 
or perceived objectives. They can include development partners, clients, end-users, civil society, 
senior management, finance, technical experts, etc. It is important to identify the interests and 
relative importance of each stakeholder. Sometimes the interests of various stakeholders can be 
in conflict or competition with each other. In practice the procurement officer usually needs to 
develop a collaborative, but focused relationship with key stakeholders. This includes listening 
to their concerns and ideas, seeking their agreement where necessary, keeping them informed, 
challenging their needs and wants, and adapting to their needs where necessary. Nevertheless, in 
this process, the procurement officer at the same time needs to represent and defend the interest 
of the UN organization within its regulative and procedural framework. 
 
Specific objectives of key stakeholders may relate to: 
 
 delivery times 
 adherence to specific regulatory frameworks 
 sourcing from specific groups of suppliers 
 use of specific brands, if justified. 
 
These stakeholder objectives need to be combined with the information gathered during the 
requirement &nbsp;specification &nbsp;and &nbsp;supply &nbsp;market &nbsp;analysis &nbsp;and &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;overall &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;
strategy. Then, if necessary through a collaborative process, the objectives and outcomes for the 
procurement should be agreed. At this time performance measures and indicators should also be 
agreed which will enable the procurement officer to determine whether the agreed procurement 
objectives have been met.

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Information gathering 
 
The Information gathering stage relates to collecting and analysing two types of information: 
 
 definition of requirement 
 analysis of the supply market. 
 
The information gathered in both cases will provide input into the identification of the objectives 
and outcomes and development of the procurement plan. 
 
Note: Further details on information gathering are provided in Unit 3.2 Requirement Definition 
and 3.3 Sourcing.  
 
 
Development of the procurement plan 
 
Once the objectives have been set and the relevant information on the requirement definition and 
the &nbsp;supply &nbsp;market &nbsp;has &nbsp;been &nbsp;gathered &nbsp;the &nbsp;next &nbsp;stage &nbsp;is &nbsp;to &nbsp;develop &nbsp;the &nbsp;&ldquo;procurement &nbsp;plan&rdquo;. &nbsp;A &nbsp;key &nbsp;
element of this is selection of the procurement method. This is covered in detail in Unit 3.4 
Selection of a Procurement Strategy. 
 
Once the procurement method has been selected the procurement plan can be elaborated, often in 
collaboration with key stakeholders such as the client, requisitioner or technical experts. 
Typically the procurement plan would include the following information: 
 
 procurement objectives and performance indicators 
 breakdown of activities in accordance with the selected procurement method 
 identification of responsible party for each activity 
 timeline and milestones taking into consideration procurement method and required clearances 
 all appropriate administrative requirements (relevant codes, budget allotments, etc.).

</p>
<p>3.2 Requirement Definition 
 
Introduction 
 
Requirement definition involves defining and describing what is needed and will be procured,  
collecting information, identifying appropriate solutions and specifying these in specifications 
for goods and equipment, terms of reference (TOR) for services, or statement of works (SOW) 
for works.  
 
Specifications, TOR and SOW constitute the technical basis for the solicitation and the 
evaluation of offers to determine if they satisfy the requirements as stipulated in the solicitation 
documents. &nbsp;They &nbsp;become &nbsp;the &nbsp;&ldquo;heart&rdquo; &nbsp;around &nbsp;which &nbsp;the &nbsp;eventual &nbsp;contract &nbsp;is &nbsp;written &nbsp;and &nbsp;later &nbsp;
administered. They have an effect on the procurement that lasts its entire lifetime&mdash;from 
planning, through bid evaluation, award and contract performance up to completion and post-
contract evaluations. A clear and appropriate definition and description of the need is of utmost 
importance. 
 
Purpose 
Requirements should be defined with the aim of opening up competition, i.e. no use of brand 
names or other unnecessary restrictions. Requirement definition should identify the exact need 
(technical and quality), aiming at avoiding over-specifications (as this may increase the cost) or 
under-specifications &nbsp;(where &nbsp;needs &nbsp;will &nbsp;not &nbsp;be &nbsp;met), &nbsp;as &nbsp;well &nbsp;as &nbsp;the &nbsp;&ldquo;when&rdquo; &nbsp;it &nbsp;is &nbsp;needed &nbsp;(timing), &nbsp;
in order to avoid progress delays or losses for example due to extra storage and handling charges 
if delivered earlier than required.  
 
Responsibility 
Requirement definition is formally the responsibility of the requisitioner. However, the 
procurement officer is responsible for ensuring the technical description provided by the 
requisitioner is free of ambiguities, is clear and generic, and promotes fair competition among 
the suppliers. 
 
The procurement officer plays a support role to the requisitioner in the following areas: 
 
 Provide information on previous, current and upcoming procurement activities for similar 
</p>
<p>products or services. 
 Review of the requisition for completeness and ensure that the specifications or descriptions 
</p>
<p>are not restrictive or biased towards a specific supplier. 
 Assist in market studies to identify sources of supplies, pricing and availability information and 
</p>
<p>extent of competition. 
 Provide advice on the best method to obtain goods and services in a timely manner, at the best 
</p>
<p>possible price. 
 
Defining the requirement starts when a need is identified and is an integral part of the individual 
planning activities described in Unit 2.2.  A systematic and team approach between 
programme/project and procurement officers is recommended to develop a generic technical 
description. Early involvement of the procurement officer can add value due to experience with 
similar types of requirements. At the conclusion of this process, the requisitioner should review 
the finished description to ensure that it responds to the need identified. The final requirement </p>

</p>
<p> 
 
Requirement analysis 
 
During this phase the requisitioner will identify the requirements, i.e. what is the list of 
functions, performances, and technical characteristics needed to be included in the 
Specification/TOR/ SOW. For example, the requirements for buying a generating set include: 
Where will it be used? Under which weather conditions? What is the minimum power 
requirement in KVA (Kilo Volt-Ampere)? Is a local representative needed? etc. For services the 
objectives should be identified. For works, what should be constructed, where, and for what 
purpose, should be defined. 
 
 
Information gathering 
 
Once the requirement has been defined, information needs to be gathered on what is available on 
the market, to define the specification/TOR/SOW. For services, information should be sought on 
the current situation, which activities and outputs are required to achieve the objectives defined, 
what input is required to perform the activities etc. For works, information should be sought on 
the construction site, soil conditions, access to the site, materials to be used, possible drawings, 
local conditions that must be adhered to, permissions that need to be sought etc. 
Developing specifications/TOR/SOW require consultation with the requisitioner, and with 
procurement officers who have been buying similar products or services, technical specialists, 
other users of similar goods, etc. 
 
Request for information 
A &nbsp;specific &nbsp;inquiry, &nbsp;called &nbsp;&lsquo;request &nbsp;for &nbsp;information&rsquo; &nbsp;(ROI), &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;used &nbsp;to &nbsp;obtain &nbsp;information &nbsp;
from potential suppliers on specifications of their latest products, price indications, or any other 
information that could be used. This tool is mostly used in the sourcing process, but can also be 
used specifically to obtain information for developing specifications/TOR/ SOW. It is not used 
to design specifications which suit a specific supplier, but rather to learn and broaden the 
knowledge of what is available on the market. Policy on contact with suppliers may differ 
between organizations, and procurement officers should follow the respective guidelines of their 
organizations.   
 
Standard specifications in the UN system of organizations 
Technical descriptions of products require developing product specifications.  However, before 
writing technical descriptions and developing product specifications, requisitioners and 
procurement officers are advised to check whether generic or other product specifications 
already exist by consulting other UN organizations in the system likely to procure these items on </p>

</p>
<p>a regular basis. Sometimes a standard specification has already been developed for the 
requirement. For example, an organization such as UNHCR, which buys plastic sheeting in high 
volume for its refugee camps, may have developed a standard for this product which could be 
used system wide. In some cases, standard specifications exist for recurring products, such as 
those determined in the compendium of generic specifications for emergency relief items 
published by IAPSO (http://www.iapso.org/pdf/erc_vol1.pdf). These standard specifications 
limit the variety of types, grades, and sizes of products that are often used to allow 
interchangeability and inventory control. They also inform potential suppliers of product 
standards used by the UN organizations which allows suppliers to adapt their products to meet 
these standards. Standard stock item descriptions, for example in the UNICEF stocked items 
catalogue, are a valuable source of information. 
 
 
Writing specifications/TOR/SOW 
 
Based on the requirement analysis and information gathering, the requisitioner must write up the 
specifications/TOR/SOW. It is important to use clear language and be accurate in all 
descriptions, to minimize misinterpretation risks. It is good practice to engage a specialist to 
review and proof the specifications/SOW/TOR before finalising. 
 
A common mistake is to include information that should not be part of the specifications/TOR/ 
SOW. Because the specifications/TOR/SOW are incorporated into the contract, they should 
NOT address, for example, the following: 
 
Pre-award issues 
Pre-award issues are not included in the contract (even though such issues might have a 
significant effect prior to award).  These belong in the solicitation, but not in the 
specifications/TOR/SOW. The entire specifications/TOR/SOW will become a part of the 
contract. The most obvious example of pre-award&ndash;related documentation is the evaluation 
criteria that appear in the RFP/ITB. 
 
Terms and conditions 
Contract terms and conditions determine the rights and responsibilities of each contracting party.  
They are included in the solicitation and in the contract, but not in the specifications/TOR/SOW. 
If any terms and conditions are included in the specifications/TOR/ SOW, there are two risks: 
Being repetitious, which can lead to an unnecessarily lengthy document, and risk of 
contradictions/ambiguities, which can lead to contract disputes. 
 
The process for writing specifications/TOR/SOW is the same for all procurement activities. 
However, the details differ for procurement of goods, services and works. The following 
guidelines could be used to prepare specifications/TOR/SOW for each of these situations: 
 
Preparation of specifications for goods 
Specifications or the description of physical or functional characteristics of tangible goods must 
provide a detailed description of the requirements. They should be generic in nature to enable the 
broadest possible competition.  
 
 
 
Specifications may be stated as one or a combination of the following: </p>

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-10 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p> 
Specification Description 
Functional Concentrates on what a product is to do and is less interested in 
</p>
<p>materials and dimensions.  
 
Example:  dry erase markers for use on porcelain and dry erase 
boards, glass, unpainted metal, and glazed ceramics. 
</p>
<p>Performance Describes what is to be achieved rather than providing a fixed 
description of how it should be done.  To ensure the quality, a 
reference to the concerned product standards (e.g. ISO) and 
environmental requirements (e.g. Energy Star), should be made.  
 
Example:  fine tip dry erase markers; durable tip will not soften or 
spread; quick-drying inc; wipes off easily; certified non-toxic by 
marker industry (AP) standards. 
</p>
<p>Technical Defines exact design and details of a good (i.e. the physical attributes, 
material to be used, power input and output, the manufacturing 
process required, or in the case of a service, the working methods to 
be used). Due to its uniqueness, design specifications may limit 
competition because of differences in engineering practices. 
</p>
<p> 
All three specification types can be combined. It is better, whenever possible; to use performance 
and functional specifications rather than technical specifications as this allows suppliers to offer 
alternative and innovative ideas and solutions to problems, which often results in a more cost 
effective use of the resources. However, depending on the products and end-user needs, certain 
requirements may not be adequately defined in functional and performance terms alone.  
 
In addition, minimum requirements should be stated. The supplier should never be put in the 
position of having to decide on which physical attributes are essential and which are not. Instead 
of minimum requirements, the requisitioner may accept equipment within a limited range of 
specifications.  
 
Use of brand names 
Brand names or similar references should be avoided. If it is necessary to cite a brand name, the 
words &nbsp;&ldquo;or &nbsp;equivalent&rdquo; &nbsp;should &nbsp;be &nbsp;included (e.g. Expo&reg;Fine Tip Dry-Erase Marker or equal dry-
erase marker).  
 
It is sometimes more practical to specify a brand name for the purpose of defining acceptable 
functional, performance and/or technical standards. However specifying brand names should be 
avoided as much as possible.  Whenever brand names are used to define functional, performance 
and/or technical requirements, remember that: 
 
 Nomination of these products should only be used to define the required product standard. 
 Brand names should never be used without also specifying the minimum requirements that are 
</p>
<p>considered essential. The supplier should not be put in the position of having to decide which 
characteristics are essential and which are not.  
</p>
<p> The specification should clearly invite offers of equivalent products, i.e. products meeting 
similar &nbsp;functional, &nbsp;performance &nbsp;and/or &nbsp;technical &nbsp;standards &nbsp;by &nbsp;adding &nbsp;the &nbsp;wording &nbsp;&ldquo;or &nbsp;
equivalent&rdquo;. &nbsp;For &nbsp;example, &nbsp;&ldquo;self &nbsp;propelled &nbsp;crab &nbsp;steering &nbsp;type &nbsp;crane &nbsp;with &nbsp;telescopic &nbsp;boom &nbsp;</p>

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>equivalent in performance to Terex PPM model no XYZ, or equivalent brand from reputable 
manufacturers &nbsp;are &nbsp;acceptable&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p> The specification should clearly indicate that no particular preference will be given to the 
specified brand names when evaluating the offers. 
</p>
<p> 
In some unique circumstances, restrictive specifications or even particular brand names may be 
needed.  For example, restrictive specifications may be needed to ensure that the product is 
compatible with existing equipment at the equipment installation site.  If restrictive 
specifications are needed, justification should be documented.  Procurement officers are required 
by their FRR to obtain such justification and document it on file.  
 
Use of samples and drawings 
For some products it may be necessary for the UN organization to provide a sample of the item 
required with the specifications, asking suppliers to propose goods in accordance with the 
sample. Samples should always be accompanied by specifications. Using samples complicates 
logistics and increases cost as samples must be sent to all suppliers invited to bid. 
 
Samples may also be requested from the supplier to demonstrate what they are offering, to be 
used for the evaluation (see Units 3.5 Solicitation documents and 3.7 Evaluation for further 
details). It should be made clear in the solicitation documents that samples must be free of charge 
and whether they will be returned to suppliers or not. 
 
Drawings can be used in a specification to provide guidance to suppliers. Drawings are useful for 
example, to describe a site where products are to be installed. Drawings also help suppliers 
understand how the various products will interact. For example, if buying pipes, fittings, valves, 
tees, elbows, meters, etc. used for a water distribution system, it might be a good idea to include 
a drawing showing what the distribution system will look like.  
 
Use of samples and/or drawings in specifications involve the following risks: 
 
 Providing a sample or drawing of a specific product can be like specifying a brand name, i.e. it 
</p>
<p>might limit the competition. 
 If the supplier manufactures the products as per the drawing provided and there was a mistake 
</p>
<p>in the drawing, the buyer is responsible for the mistake. 
 This limits innovative thinking as suppliers are limited to offering a product which conforms to 
</p>
<p>the sample/drawing. 
 Always check whether it is allowed to include a sample/drawing in a specification as the use of 
</p>
<p>the sample/drawing could be restricted due to copyright.

<p>Content of specifications 
The table below provides a list of information that may be included in a specification and some 
guidelines and examples on what they should contain. 
 
Topic Guidelines 
Title  Use a simple and broad description of the specified goods for the title. 
</p>
<p>For &nbsp;example, &nbsp;&ldquo;Steel &nbsp;Reinforcing &nbsp;Bar&rdquo;. &nbsp; 
 Potential suppliers may decide not to make an offer only on the basis of 
</p>
<p>the title. 
Background 
information 
</p>
<p>A well-written &nbsp;introduction &nbsp;usually &nbsp;increases &nbsp;potential &nbsp;suppliers&rsquo; &nbsp;interest &nbsp;
in the invitation and help them understand the needs. Further, an 
understanding of the purpose can be useful to ensure that offered products 
are &nbsp;&ldquo;fit &nbsp;for &nbsp;purpose&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>Standards  Standards are the most common document referred to in a specification. 
Refer as much as possible to international standards such as ISO, EN, 
etc. rather than national standards as this might limit the competition. 
</p>
<p> If national competition is foreseen, national standards might be the 
appropriate solution.  
</p>
<p> If &nbsp;a &nbsp;specific &nbsp;standard &nbsp;is &nbsp;not &nbsp;mandatory, &nbsp;indicate &nbsp;&ldquo;or &nbsp;equivalent &nbsp;
standards&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>Specific 
constraints and 
limitations 
</p>
<p>Some examples of specific constraints and limitations are: 
 Operating conditions e.g. maximum and minimum temperatures, noise, 
</p>
<p>pressure, humidity, wind velocity, altitude, dust, etc.  
 Physical space available for installing equipment.  
 Compatibility with existing equipment, systems, etc.  
 Availability of power supply. 
 Servicing or maintenance requirements or limitations etc. 
</p>
<p>Requirements This describes the requirement in detail. There are 3 types of specification 
types: functional characteristics, performance characteristics and technical 
characteristics.  
Usually the requirement is a combination of the three types of 
specifications. 
</p>
<p>Marking Possible marking requirements (to be agreed with end-user or project 
coordinator) are: 
 identification marking  
 manufacturer&rsquo;s &nbsp;name 
 model number 
 manufacturing standard 
 warnings (e.g. if fragile equipment). 
</p>
<p>Packing Items may need to be packed before delivery to protect them from damage 
during shipment and storage.  
 If special packing is needed this must be specified: cartons, wooden box, 
</p>
<p>wooden crates, containers, etc.  
 If a particular size or condition of the container is required, this must be 
</p>
<p>specified (see Unit 4.3 Logistics).  
 If the organization wants to keep the containers, pallets or other packing 
</p>
<p>material, this should also be specified. 
Packaging  Some goods may be available with different packaging options such as 
</p>
<p>the size &amp; composition of the container. </p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Topic Guidelines 
 Where different possibilities exist, specify what is required, for example, 
&ldquo;computer &nbsp;screen &nbsp;cleaning &nbsp;fluid &nbsp;in &nbsp;100ml &nbsp;plastic &nbsp;bottles&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>Quality Specifying quality requirements reduces risks associated with the goods. 
For &nbsp;example, &nbsp;&ldquo;only &nbsp;goods &nbsp;produced &nbsp;by &nbsp;suppliers &nbsp;adhering &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;ISO &nbsp;9000 &nbsp;
quality &nbsp;system &nbsp;are &nbsp;acceptable&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>Testing For some goods, testing might be required: 
 By the supplier (the buyer should specify the test requirements). 
 By a third-party organization. 
 If testing is specified, the provision of test results should be specified as 
</p>
<p>well. 
 
Good practice 
It is good practice to develop robust specifications.  Some guidelines on how to achieve this are 
provided below: 
 
 State the requirement clearly, concisely and logically in functional and performance terms 
</p>
<p>unless specific technical requirements are needed. 
 Include enough information for suppliers to identify what is required and to cost it accordingly. 
 Provide &nbsp;equal &nbsp;opportunity &nbsp;for &nbsp;all &nbsp;potential &nbsp;suppliers &nbsp;to &nbsp;offer &nbsp;goods &nbsp;which &nbsp;satisfy &nbsp;the &nbsp;user&rsquo;s &nbsp;
</p>
<p>needs, including alternative solutions. 
 Do not over-specify requirements as this might limit the number of responses. 
 Do not include unnecessary features that might prevent some suppliers from offering. 
 Indicate requirements regarding delivery and after sales service etc. 
 Whenever possible, indicate the final use (e.g. pipes: for construction of buildings, for water 
</p>
<p>supply, gas supply etc). 
 Do not allow the product requested to be covered by sole patent rights. 
 Challenge the requisitioner if they request one particular product brand or manufacturer. Ask 
</p>
<p>for valid reasons as they should be prepared to accept any brand that fully meets the 
specifications and requirements. 
</p>
<p> For technical equipment, with specifications originating from a particular manufacturer or 
brand provided by a requisitioner ready to accept other manufacturers or brands, neutralise and 
make the specifications generic to allow for similar products of other brands. Check 
specifications of products originating from other known suppliers to ensure that the minimum 
requirements included in the invitation to bid will allow other suppliers to quote as well. 
</p>
<p> For goods or equipment not previously procured and lacking specifications from the 
requisitioner, ask suppliers commonly used for similar equipment, to provide their 
specifications as input for drafting the  specifications with acceptance by the requisitioner. 
Buyers should be careful not to reveal too much information to the contacted supplier in order 
not to give a potential advantage to this supplier. For example, do not reveal the intension to 
issue an invitation to bid very soon, do not reveal the country of destination, the quantity to be 
purchased, etc. 
</p>
<p> Where there is a lack of specifications, it may be challenging to define what is important for 
the goods and equipment. When such a situation occurs, there are several potential options: 
 Consult with colleagues who have experience and background within the specific area and 
</p>
<p>who will be able to guide the requisitioner to define what is required. 
 Check the internet. 
 Consult existing brochures and catalogues.  </p>

</p>
<p> Consult with suppliers or manufacturers specialized in the type of products. However, be 
careful not to reveal too much advanced information (see paragraph above) 
</p>
<p> In exceptional cases, use consultants to help prepare specifications. 
 
Preparation of terms of reference (TOR) for services 
The terms of reference (TOR) for services should define the scope of work required and 
respective supplier and stakeholder responsibilities. Adequate and clear TOR are imperative for 
an understanding of the assignment, and to minimize any risk of ambiguities during the 
preparation of suppliers proposals, negotiations and execution of services. 
The &nbsp;TOR, &nbsp;often &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;first &nbsp;and &nbsp;main &nbsp;introduction &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;assignment, &nbsp;form &nbsp;the &nbsp;basis &nbsp;for &nbsp;
the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;preparation &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;technical &nbsp;and &nbsp;financial &nbsp;proposals, &nbsp;and &nbsp;also &nbsp;eventually &nbsp;become an 
integral part of the contract between the supplier and procuring entity. Clear and unambiguous 
TOR will force the supplier to prepare clear and detailed proposals, leading to successfully 
implemented projects and limiting the risks of disputes and claims.  
 
Unclear TOR require suppliers to make assumptions. When various suppliers make different 
assumptions, comparing technical proposals becomes very difficult, and the procurement officer  
will have problems evaluating the proposals in a fair and transparent way. Unclear TOR can also 
lead to less successful projects, as the winning supplier might not provide what is really needed. 
Further, there is a risk of disputes and claims, as it might not be clear who is responsible for 
what. 
 
It is important that the end-user actively participates in the preparation of the TOR. The process 
of developing TOR requires detailed knowledge of the background, the current situation and 
possible constraints (political situation, cultural or environmental constraints etc.). At the same 
time, preparation of TOR creates an important awareness of the future consultancy to be 
provided, and ownership, which is important when the supplier is to cooperate with an end-user. 
The process of preparing TOR often reveals unrealistic expectations as to what can be achieved 
in the current situation. Thus, preparation should be as participatory as possible, to ensure 
agreement on the level of expectations. 
 
At the same time, end-users usually need assistance in the preparation of TOR, as this is a 
complex matter, which requires experience and methodology. Further, it can be useful to have 
somebody (e.g. the procurement officer) who is not fully familiar with the requirements of the 
consultancy, to ask questions, to clarify issues which might be self-evident to the end-user, but 
which might need to be clarified with the supplier. 
 
Content of the TOR 
Standards in writing of TOR can vary between organizations. To be as clear and precise as 
possible, the TOR should include the sections/information shown in the table below. This 
structure is most useful for review or preparation of TOR for consultancy services for 
development projects. However, the structure can also be used for more simple services, e.g. 
service contracts for maintenance of equipment etc.

 Presentation material (if any) 
 Workshop /training evaluation report (if any). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
Review budget 
In parallel to the development of TOR, the budget should be reviewed to ensure that the budget 
and TOR are aligned. The budget should include the following break down of costs: 
 
 Suppliers&rsquo; &nbsp;fees &nbsp;(international &nbsp;and &nbsp;national), &nbsp;listed as number of working months/weeks/days x 
</p>
<p>fee per working month/week/day. 
 Daily subsistence allowance (DSA) multiplied by the number of days. 
 International transportation costs (number of round trips between destination x price) 
 Local transportation costs (if any &ndash; minor costs are included in the DSA, but if the suppliers are 
</p>
<p>to do major travelling within the country, this should be budgeted). 
 Other relevant costs such as communication and printing costs, costs for translation of reports 
</p>
<p>and interpreter services, costs in relation to workshops and/or training courses (rental of 
facilities and equipment, production of material, beverages and other costs in relation to 
participants) and other specific inputs required to carry out the consultancy. 
</p>
<p> 
The budget can be for internal purposes only (and not be included in the TOR). This ensures 
competition also on the price and not only on the technical part of the proposal from consulting 
companies. However, in certain cases, in particular if it is very difficult to estimate the input 
needed in terms of working days etc. or the TOR is a little vague, it can be useful to provide the 
total budget as an indication to the suppliers on what level the consultancy is on. 
Preparation of SOW/BoQ/technical specifications for works 
The statement of works (SOW) including design/drawings, bill of quantities (BoQ) and technical 
specifications, should describe the works in sufficient detail to identify the location, nature and 
any &nbsp;complexities &nbsp;involved. &nbsp;The &nbsp;term &nbsp;&ldquo;works&rdquo; &nbsp;generally &nbsp;includes all types of civil, mechanical, 
electrical or other engineering/installation services (other than consulting services) as well as the 
supply of construction materials and equipment included therein.

</p>
<p>Expected construction period and time in weeks or months, or where alternative time schedules 
are permitted, the range of acceptable construction periods, should be defined. In addition, 
information should be provided on the topography, geotechnical conditions, access to site, 
transportation and communication facilities, project layout, services to be provided by the UN 
organization, method of measurement and payment of completed works. 
 
The unique nature of works requires that detailed design specifications be provided and a 
complete description and specification of all goods, materials and works to be included in the 
delivery, including detailed drawings and the requirement that the supplier possesses the 
necessary qualifications with respect to capacity and experience and financial strength necessary 
to carry out the type of job requested.  
 
It is common practice to use the services of a consulting engineer to help in the completion of 
technical specifications for large and/or complex works. In cases where an external consulting 
engineer is used, this person/company could also be asked to prepare the details of the 
solicitation documents. However, in the following some general tips and things to remember for 
preparation of the SOW/BoQ/technical specifications is provided. In cases where a consulting 
engineer is used, these general tips can be used to check/follow-up on the work of the engineer. 
 
Content of statement of works (SOW) 
The statement of works (SOW) provides background and detailed information for the 
construction works.  To be as clear and precise as possible, the SOW should include the 
sections/information shown in the table below. 
 
Section Include 
Background Describe the project, its purpose and functionality. This should include 
</p>
<p>any relevant information that would help someone not familiar with the 
current situation to form a clear picture of what is required. This is also 
important &nbsp;as &nbsp;implied &nbsp;warranties &nbsp;for &nbsp;&ldquo;fit &nbsp;for &nbsp;purpose&rdquo; &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;derived &nbsp;from &nbsp;
detailed background provided to suppliers as the overall scope of the 
project. 
</p>
<p>General Information Give all necessary general information, including but not necessarily 
limited to the following: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Topic Guidelines 
Location  Give precise information and a brief description of 
</p>
<p>site accessibility and availability of major services 
such as electricity and water.  
</p>
<p> Location of sources of rough materials such as sand 
and stones might be helpful. 
</p>
<p>Legal status Check the legal status of the titles for the plot where 
the construction will take place. 
</p>
<p>Site ownership Clarify ownership of the site. 
Designs/drawings  Indicate whether the designs are being provided or 
</p>
<p>should be elaborated by the supplier.  
 Check that the designs have been registered and 
</p>
<p>comply with local regulations, and clarify who is 
responsible for what in that respect.

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Bill of quantities 
The bill of quantities (BoQ) is the list of all main components of the project (buildings, roads, 
sidewalks, lighting, equipment, etc) including estimated quantities for each line item (soil 
movements/ excavations, structures, roofing, floors, sanitation, etc) and information on the way 
it will be paid (e.g. lump sum or unit price). 
 
The preparation of the BoQ is the most difficult part because it should be complete and 
exhaustive especially in contracts based on unit prices. Even though less detail or fewer items are 
needed in lump sum contracts, such contracts require good technical specifications and careful 
supervision. 
 
Technical specifications 
In addition to the BoQ, technical specifications need to be developed. These describe in detail 
the specification for each construction item e.g. type of cement mix, type of iron rods, bricks, 
etc. The technical specifications should follow the order of the main components as described in 
the BoQ for easy reference.  The following items should be defined: 
 
 Lab &nbsp;methods &nbsp;for &nbsp;&ldquo;quality &nbsp;control&rdquo; &nbsp;of &nbsp;each &nbsp;item, &nbsp;when &nbsp;relevant. &nbsp; 
 Rules to accept or reject materials or works. 
 Methods for measurement and payment of each item. (What works, materials, etc, are included 
</p>
<p>in each item and the criteria to measure them). 
 Environmental conservation policies and responsibility of supplier to adhere. 
 Quality assurance programme. 
 
Sign off on final version of specifications/TOR/SOW 
It is good practice to ensure that the requisitioner signs off on the final version of the 
specifications/TOR/SOW. In some organizations this is ensured by signing the complete 
requisition package (see below). The purpose is to ensure that all parties agree to the final 
document, in order to avoid subsequent changes and ensure acceptability of offers that are 
evaluated according to the requirement definition. 
 
 
Requisitioning  
 
When the specifications/TOR/SOW have been finalized, a formal requisition can be created. 
Most UN organizations use a formal requisition process for all procurement activities. 
Requisitions can be submitted by clients to the organization, programme staff to procurement 
officers, field staff to centralized procurement support staff etc. Requisitioning is conducted in 
different ways in various organizations depending on the set-up and business structure of the 
organisation.  In general, the following applies if a requisition process is used.   
 
After researching, planning, and describing what is needed, it must be documented that all 
necessary UN financial and administrative requirements have been met.  Together this is 
generally considered to be a requisition package.  Such packages vary in terms of both the 
preparation time and the documentation required.  Typical information that could form part of 
the requisition package can be: 
 
 funds allocation and source 
 budget breakdown, including freight, clearing and contingency cost 
 mode of shipment </p>

</p>
<p> information on destination/consignee 
 written justification support memo for sole source (if applicable) 
 delivery time/schedule 
 late delivery consequences, performance incentives 
 specifications/TOR/SOW 
 drawings, if applicable 
 design change/deviation options, if applicable 
 required quality standards 
 inspection and quality assurance information 
 specific test requirements. 
 
Requisition splitting 
Some &nbsp;requisitioners &nbsp;intentionally &nbsp;&ldquo;split&rdquo; &nbsp;requirements &nbsp;by &nbsp;processing &nbsp;them &nbsp;under &nbsp;several &nbsp;lower &nbsp;
monetary requirements. They reason that by staying under a specific monetary threshold on each 
requisition, they are benefiting their organization by cutting processing time.  By remaining 
under certain monetary thresholds, they avoid requirements associated with those thresholds, 
such as requirements for competitive solicitations, contracts reviews, and so forth. In reality, the 
practice of splitting a requirement is a short-sighted business approach that is generally counter-
productive, and undermines the integrity of the whole system. 
 
Splitting a requirement actually hinders the procurement process because it: 
 
 Contravenes &nbsp;the &nbsp;spirit &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN &nbsp;financial &nbsp;rules &nbsp;which &nbsp;require &nbsp;&ldquo;best &nbsp;value &nbsp;for &nbsp;money&rdquo;. 
 Is &nbsp;not &nbsp;cost &nbsp;effective, &nbsp;increases &nbsp;the &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;office&rsquo;s &nbsp;administrative &nbsp;workload, and increases 
</p>
<p>monitoring problems. 
 Subjects the procurement process to possible criticism from auditors and members of the 
</p>
<p>international community for paying too much for goods and services while restricting 
competition. 
</p>
<p> Prevents the UN from procuring supplies by the most advantageous order quantity and other 
volume discount practices offered by commercial suppliers. 
</p>
<p> 
Required review and approvals of requisitions 
Procurement officers regard requisition approval by an appropriate authority as confirmation that 
a need exists for the goods or services specified and that the funding has been made available.  In 
some organizations the review and approval of requisitions forms part of the review and 
approval of the project document. 
 
Some organizations allow solicitation to be undertaken before formal approval of the requisition 
and even at times before the approval of the project document, especially in cases of extreme 
urgency. Due to the increased risk of cancellation of solicitation processes, such practices should 
be used with caution as this might influence supplier handling of future tenders. 
 
Consequences of incomplete requisition packages 
When a requisition package is incomplete, a procurement officer will identify the deficiencies 
and request correction and re-submission. Timely submission of these corrections is critical 
because the procurement process does not normally begin until submission of a complete 
procurement request package.

<p>Acknowledging receipt of a requisition 
Some organizations have adopted the practice of acknowledging receipt of the requisition. 
This increases requisitioners awareness of and satisfaction with the procurement process. It is 
also helpful to acknowledge receipt of requisition by letter or e-mail to the requisitioner 
confirming accuracy of requisition including realistic delivery period requested and any need for 
change. Acknowledgement should take place as soon as possible after receipt of requisition.

<p>3.3 Sourcing 
 
Introduction 
 
Sourcing is defined as a technical activity with the purpose of identifying existing suitable 
products and services on the market and qualified suppliers available to provide those products 
and services. Sourcing also aims at collecting and analysing information about capabilities 
within the &nbsp;market &nbsp;to &nbsp;satisfy &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;requirements, &nbsp;such &nbsp;as &nbsp;obtaining &nbsp;updated &nbsp;cost &nbsp;
information, determining the appropriate technology and alternative products, as well as 
identifying appropriate supplier qualification criteria. 
 
A thorough sourcing process, leading to identification and invitation of relevant suppliers, 
ensures maximised competition, by allowing the most relevant and suitable companies to 
compete.  Sourcing also leads to a better understanding of the market. This knowledge helps to: 
 
 assist in a make or buy or lease decision 
 determine when to buy  
 establish realistic delivery schedules 
 review sole/single source justifications 
 identify price and non price evaluation factors 
 identify special terms and conditions for the solicitation and resulting contract that are 
</p>
<p>customary in special markets 
 establish realistic budgets, pricing arrangements and economic ordering quantities1. 
 
Sourcing is often conducted in parallel with requirement definition (see Unit 3.2). An issue 
procurement officers should keep in mind is that while requisitioners are preparing 
specifications/TORs/SOW, they are informally performing technical market research by 
discussing forthcoming procurement action with prospective suppliers. This communication, 
although an important part of the needs assessment process, is sensitive, as it can give rise to 
biased specifications or perception of favouritism. Procurement officers should advise the 
requisitioner on the risk associated, and should explain that it is important that no supplier be 
given an advantage through upfront information, and that care should be taken to ensure that no 
supplier gets the impression that they have an increased opportunity to be awarded a contract.

</p>
<p>Sourcing is conducted differently in the various UN organizations. The tools applied and means 
used vary according to the product/service to be procured as well as the budget, strategic 
importance of the market etc. Each stage in the sourcing process and a selection of possible tools 
and means are detailed below. 
 
 
Market research 
 
Market research should identify relevant suppliers and products that could meet the needs of the 
organization. The amount of effort required for market research depends on the value/risk of the 
requirement. For small standard procurement activities research may be limited to searching 
existing rosters and previous contracts. For larger or more complex procurement, extensive 
market analysis is required.   
 
Advertisement of business opportunities 
Procurement activities should be made widely known to all potential suppliers. This can be 
achieved through various means, for example by advertising: 
 
 Procurement plans, information on specifications for standard products, specifications of sole 
</p>
<p>source products, etc. in order to provide suppliers with the opportunity to express interest.  
 Request for expression of interest, request for information, pre-qualification exercises. 
 Open tenders as a means to reach out broadly to the supplier community.  
 
In some organizations, advertising is mandatory above certain thresholds.  The most frequently 
used means for advertising business opportunities are the: 
 
 Organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;website 
 United Nations Global Marketplace (UNGM) 
 Development Business (website or journal) 
 websites of donors or end-users (governments) 
 local newspapers, or other media (e.g. radio) depending on the local media infrastructure. 
 
Note: These tools are further described below, and in Unit 3.4 for open tenders. 
 
Advertising contract award notices also fosters transparency and competition for future 
procurement opportunities (for further details see Unit 3.9 Contract Finalization and Issuance). 
 
United Nations Global Marketplace 
The Inter-Agency Procurement Working Group (IAPWG) has developed the UN Global Market 
Place, UNGM (www.ungm.org) as the main procurement portal for both suppliers and 
procurement officers in the UN system of organizations. The UNGM is accessible for all 
procurement officers in the UN system of organizations and provides a user friendly interface 
with extensive search capabilities, as well as short-listing and export facilities. It can be used 
both &nbsp;in &nbsp;terms &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;&ldquo;yellow pages&rdquo; &nbsp;approach &nbsp;and &nbsp;as &nbsp;a &nbsp;register &nbsp;of &nbsp;eligible &nbsp;suppliers &nbsp;for &nbsp;particular &nbsp;
commodities. The facilities available in the UNGM are being continually updated. UNGM is 
considered the main global roster of suppliers for the UN organizations and is a natural starting 
point for any market research to be undertaken. More information on UNGM is provided under 
Pre-Qualification as well as Supplier Management (see below).

<p>Other sources of information for market research 
 
The table below lists other available sources of information for market research. 
 
Source Including 
Internal  Locally established rosters. 
</p>
<p> Former contracts. 
 Previous short-lists within same field. 
 Consultation with colleagues. 
 Sourcing support. Some organizations have a central support function

</p>
<p>bought similar products.  
 Through the IAPWG, procurement organizations of the UN are 
</p>
<p>currently developing the concept of lead agency. When fully 
developed this can provide useful information in terms of who has 
expertise on which products.  
</p>
<p> The General Business Guide provides information on who buys what. 
A link to the guide can be found at http://www.ungm.org/. 
</p>
<p>Internet references  External suppliers rosters with references to products and services. 
 DACON, a database of consulting companies maintained by the World 
</p>
<p>Bank and the Inter-American Development bank 
(www.dgmarket.com/dacon/). 
</p>
<p> Online communities of consulting and professional service providers. 
 Regional trade directories. 
 Yellow Pages for local suppliers. 
 Country and product specific directories  
 
Some directories are free of charge, others require a subscription. 
</p>
<p>Other  Commercial/specialized journals. 
 Chambers of Commerce, Trade Delegations, Permanent Missions, 
</p>
<p>Government procurement organizations. 
 Business seminars. 
 Financial reports on companies prepared by financial service 
</p>
<p>providers. 
 
Request for information (ROI) 
Some organizations issue a request for information (ROI) as part of market research. This tool 
can be used to request information on anything from technical developments, supply availability 
to price indications. The request can be openly advertised, or can be sent to particular suppliers 
known to the procurement officer, depending on the type of information to be obtained and the 
knowledge of the market. An ROI should always be written as a non-binding inquiry. 
 
Request for expression of interest (REOI) 
Request for expression of interest (REOI) is an instrument used to broadcast the need widely, 
and allows suppliers to present themselves for consideration for inclusion on a short list.  An 
REOI is a cost effective method for identifying potential suppliers for particular goods, services 
or works. An expression of interest (EOI) consists of a written communication prepared by a 
supplier providing information about its products, services, resources, qualifications and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p>

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>experience. A procurement officer can solicit an EOI by advertising the need on websites, in 
newspapers or by other means adapted to the local context. The resulting responses can be used 
to populate a roster for future use or directly for a specific procurement action. If relevant, the 
REOI can include specific short listing criteria. Some organizations (in particular those that 
apply mandatory pre-qualification of suppliers) could issue an REOI to all pre-qualified 
suppliers for a product range, and would use the result to develop the short list. 
 
Pre-qualification as part of market research 
Pre-qualification is a method whereby suppliers of particular goods, services or works are 
assessed against pre-determined qualification criteria, and only those suppliers who comply with 
the criteria are invited to tender. A pre-qualification of suppliers will ensure that bids are only 
received from suppliers which are able to comply with the requirements.  
 
Some organizations apply mandatory pre-qualification for all suppliers. For more information 
see Supplier Management below.  Pre-qualification is recommended when: 
 
 Complex or specialized goods or services are procured (e.g. civil engineering or mine 
</p>
<p>clearance services or equipment). 
 A particular type of good or works or service is procured on a regular basis (e.g. for long term 
</p>
<p>agreements). 
 High degree of risk is involved in the procurement (e.g. security and safety equipment and 
</p>
<p>services). 
 Importance of the goods or services for the project is high (e.g. late delivery or the delivery of 
</p>
<p>a wrong product or service would have costly implications). 
 
If pre-qualification is required, each of the stages in the table below should be followed. 
 
Stage Description 
</p>
<p>1 Definition of criteria for pre-qualification. 
2 Preparation of invitation for pre-qualification. 
3 Advertisement of pre-qualification on websites or other appropriate media. 
4 Evaluation of received pre-qualification applications. 
5 Preparation of short-list of suppliers (ref. below preparation of short list). 
</p>
<p> 
Analysis of the supply market 
For more complex procurement actions, extensive market research or proper supply market 
analysis should be undertaken. This enables the procuring entity to understand how a market 
works, the direction in which a market is heading, the competitiveness of a market, the key 
suppliers and the value that suppliers place on the organization as a customer. Background 
research can be done using a variety of tools which could include an ROI invitation, on-line 
databases and search engines, supplier websites and annual reports, statistical data and the like. 
In addition surveys of and interviews with key people can be conducted, as long as they are 
comprehensive enough to not create any perceived favouritism. Analysis of the collected data 
can provide insight on how to approach the market in order to source in an appropriate way. 
 
Proper supply market analysis is especially important for the lead agency commodities, and is 
highly recommended in order to gain solid understanding of strategically important markets.

</p>
<p>Establishment and signature of short list 
 
Unless a rule prescribes or a decision is made to proceed with an open tender, or market research 
justifies a waiver of competitive bidding, a short list of suppliers to be invited should be prepared 
based on the market research findings.  
 
Many aspects should be taken into account when selecting the suppliers for the short list. The 
overall goal is to increase competition to a maximum, provide a fair chance to a vast number of 
serious companies in the market, and at the same time ensure economy and efficiency of the 
procurement process by limiting competition to the most relevant suppliers. 
 
Short list criteria 
Short listing criteria can include, for example: 
 
 Monetary value of the procurement activity. The higher the value, the higher number of 
</p>
<p>companies should be short listed. Most organizations have specific requirements in this regard. 
 Share of potential markets and geographic distribution. 
 Specific requirements for the procurement action (e.g. ISO certification/quality standards, 
</p>
<p>representation of supplier in the recipient country and/or donor specific requirements as per the 
agreement with donor). 
</p>
<p> Legislative &nbsp;requirements &nbsp;(e.g. &nbsp;registration &nbsp;under &nbsp;existing &nbsp;regulation &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;country, &nbsp;
registration with a professional body, required insurances etc.). 
</p>
<p> Technical capacity and experience (i.e. relevant past experience, experience from the 
geographic area in question, availability of after sales service, availability of required 
equipment etc.). 
</p>
<p> Appropriate financial capacity compared with the value of the contract. In general, if 
information about the supplier is insufficient they should be contacted and asked for further 
information, and if the procurement officer is not confident that the supplier can meet the 
requested needs, the supplier should not be invited.  
</p>
<p> 
Pre-qualification 
Where pre-qualification has been undertaken, only those suppliers who have passed the pre-
qualification criteria should be invited to bid. 
 
Where pre-qualification has not been undertaken, some organizations still perform an eligibility 
check of each supplier before adding it to a short list. Eligibility is defined by a set of minimum 
requirements that suppliers must comply with, such as: 
 
 Legal capacity to enter into a contract, including registration of the supplier in a country 
</p>
<p>eligible for contracting. 
 Ethical principles (no child labour, involvement in production and distribution of land mines, 
</p>
<p>adherence to supplier code of conduct). 
 Product specific requirements (ISO certification etc.). 
 
Requirements &nbsp;for &nbsp;eligibility &nbsp;are &nbsp;determined &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;policy &nbsp;and/or &nbsp;the &nbsp;funding &nbsp;
organization/donor. 
 
Some organizations only short list pre-qualified suppliers, or require suppliers to register and 
pass set qualification criteria before an award can be made. Further some organizations have a 
policy to short list all pre-qualified suppliers for a product/service. </p>

<p>Signing a short list 
Short lists should be signed by the procurement officer as well as by appropriate authority as per 
the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;policy. 
 
 
Supplier management 
 
UN organizations strive to continuously identify new suppliers which could broaden the market 
for products and services procured. Some organizations give particular attention during market 
research to suppliers from developing countries or rapidly growing new markets, not to favour 
these suppliers as such but in order to broaden the source range of suppliers. 
 
Pre-qualification as a strategic tool for supplier management 
Some UN organizations undertake systematic pre-qualification of all potential suppliers. Various 
approaches exist, from requiring pre-qualification/registration with the organization to be 
completed before any contract award (i.e. upfront or in parallel with a tender process), to only 
short listing pre-qualified companies. Pre-qualification of all suppliers can be time consuming, 
but useful in particular for products/services bought on a regular basis. 
 
Through IAPWG, organizations are developing a lead agency concept, whereby each 
organization will be defined as lead agency for certain products or services. One of the next steps 
being considered is that the lead agency should undertake pre-qualification of suppliers for 
UNGM, however, the idea is still being discussed between UN organizations and no final 
conclusion has been reached yet. 
 
Use of rosters 
It is common practice to collect information on suppliers in a supplier roster that provides easily 
accessible information on suppliers and the goods and services they provide. The UNGM is used 
by 15 UN organizations as their roster for international procurement.  
 
Supplier registration in UNGM is conducted entirely on-line and suppliers are required to 
complete extensive registration information including details of the goods or services they 
provide. In some instances suppliers may be required to provide additional information to 
facilitate the eligibility check. Supplier information in UNGM is continually updated by 
automatic requests to suppliers.  Suppliers who do not update their information within a specified 
time become inactive on the roster. Suppliers may also be removed from the roster if they 
consistently fail to reply to solicitation of offers, submit false information, become bankrupt, or 
have a criminal conviction or civil judgment against them for any offence indicating a lack of 
business integrity etc. 
 
Procurement units may also decide to maintain a separate roster of suppliers, for example, local 
suppliers for particular local needs. It is essential to invest time and effort to maintain the 
database by reviewing new applications, deleting inactive suppliers and updating information on 
current suppliers. For information about the content of a supplier database, check 
www.ungm.org. Some organizations have established their own supplier evaluation groups or 
committees. They meet on a regular basis and approve new suppliers. 
Performance evaluation 
To promote economical and efficient procurement, the performance of existing suppliers should 
be evaluated on an ongoing basis. Data should be recorded, and non-performance should be 
flagged in existing rosters/information systems. </p>

</p>
<p>Some organizations have developed specific performance evaluation criteria, and use, for 
example, a point system to record performance in various categories. Typical categories can be: 
 
 quality of good and services supplied 
 compliance with delivery times/deadlines 
 after sales service provided 
 accuracy of documentation 
 speed of response and general cooperation. 
 
Ensure that performance evaluation is fed back into future sourcing processes, that are made 
available to procurement officers through rosters or other information systems used in the 
sourcing process.

<p>3.4 Selection of a Procurement Strategy 
 
Introduction 
 
Once a fully funded and approved requisition is accepted by the procurement unit and 
appropriate &nbsp;sourcing &nbsp;has &nbsp;been &nbsp;conducted, &nbsp;the &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;officer&rsquo;s &nbsp;role &nbsp;is &nbsp;central in determining 
the appropriate procurement strategy.  
 
The purpose of identifying and selecting an appropriate procurement strategy is to find the best 
way to obtain the solution/result to satisfy the needs of the end user for goods, works and 
services by obtaining the most advantageous pricing and contractual conditions through a 
competitive process that will best deliver what is required in a timely manner while ensuring 
achievement of the UN guiding procurement principles.   
 
A procurement strategy includes: 
 
 choice of the type of arrangement and/or contract to be concluded 
 choice of the procurement method  
 type of competition to be adopted to purchase the required goods/services/works.  
 
To select a procurement strategy, the procurement officer will have to consider factors such as 
the FRR, procurement procedures of the organization, delegation of authority, financial 
thresholds, internal clearance/approval procedures and corresponding administrative time 
frames, the type of procurement (goods, services or works), the complexity or the specificity of a 
requirement, the market conditions, already existing arrangements and/or contracts (e.g. LTAs) 
and the potential for collaborative procurement.  
 
 
Process 
 
The process of identifying and selecting the appropriate procurement strategy can best be 
described as a series of decisions, rather than sequential stages that need to be followed in strict 
order.  Normally, the procurement officer would only complete the most relevant stages based on 
organizational practice, &nbsp;and &nbsp;the &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;officer&rsquo;s &nbsp;experience. &nbsp; &nbsp;To &nbsp;fully &nbsp;understand &nbsp;this &nbsp;
process and the results, however, each of the logical stages in the selection of a procurement 
strategy process is provided in the flowchart below.

</p>
<p> 
Selecting a procurement strategy first involves analysing the requisition and determining the: 
 
 nature and specifications of the requirement 
 expected value of the procurement action. 
 
Once the above have been determined, then the following decisions can be taken: 
 
 which unit within the organization should conduct the action 
 whether to procure the item or to make/lease/rent it 
 whether to procure through an existing long term agreement (LTA) 
 whether to conduct a new competitive solicitation process 
 which solicitation method to be used (RFQ, ITB, RFP) 
 which competition should be chosen (limited, open or waiver). 
 
 
Analysis of the requisition 
 
During the analysis of the requisition, each of the actions below should be considered in order to 
determine the nature of the requirement, the specifications and the expected value of the 
procurement action.  
 
 Identify crucial information in the requisition as well as the requirement definition which could 
</p>
<p>have an impact on the procurement strategy (e.g. urgency, specific local requirements which 
must be met, target arrival date etc.). 
</p>
<p> Identify generic versus branded specifications. 
 Double check that the technical specifications provide a sufficiently high minimum level such 
</p>
<p>that any product meeting the requirements is acceptable 
 Ascertain the feasibility of requested delivery date and provide feedback on lead times to the 
</p>
<p>requisitioner. 
 Determine whether factors other than technical compliance should be included in the 
</p>
<p>evaluation. 
 Determine whether technical and other factors &nbsp;are &nbsp;all &nbsp;suitable &nbsp;for &nbsp;&ldquo;yes/no&rdquo; &nbsp;threshold &nbsp;conditions &nbsp;
</p>
<p>or whether any should be given weight. 
 Consider expected value of the requisition, in relation to relevant financial thresholds for 
</p>
<p>procedures and delegations. 
 Consider whether requisition can be packaged with other similar requests awaiting 
</p>
<p>procurement or identified during the organization-wide needs analysis. 
 
 
Selection of responsible unit 
 
The framework, the structure and the delegations of authority will determine who should respond 
to the end-user requirements within an organization.  This decision may depend in part on 
whether the supply is expected to be available locally/regionally.  Central and decentralized units 
are sometimes authorized to operate in different markets, depending on the organization. 
Capacity of each unit might also be considered.

</p>
<p> 
Consideration of not-buy options  
 
It is important to consider options other than buying, including: 
 
 make versus buy 
 lease versus buy 
 incorporate in other procurement versus buy. 
 
The decision to make, buy, lease or incorporate in other procurement should be made jointly by 
the procurement officer and the requisitioner. Some factors to consider in these decisions are 
provided below.  
 
Make versus buy 
A make or buy analysis will result in the decision to provide the good or service by using 
internal organizational resources or to contract out for similar support to meet a given need.  For 
example, such decisions may arise as an internal consideration when a large programme 
considers setting up its own maintenance and repair shop versus contracting for the service 
outside; such decisions may also be appropriate where a government entity could provide the 
services using its own resources versus procurement on the open market; development of own 
software versus buying off the shelf. 
 
When comparing costs between the UN organization and the market, the following principles 
should be followed: 
 
 All &nbsp;cost &nbsp;comparisons &nbsp;should &nbsp;be &nbsp;based &nbsp;on &nbsp;an &nbsp;&ldquo;apples &nbsp;with &nbsp;apples&rdquo; &nbsp;approach. 
 The costs for maintaining the same service levels and quality should be considered. 
 Time required to produce and deliver the same product or service internally or externally 
</p>
<p>should be considered. 
 Likely availability of internal expert resources to produce, deliver and maintain (as 
</p>
<p>appropriate). 
 Impact on the programme/project if internal resources cannot deliver on time or with 
</p>
<p>equivalent quality. 
 All costs should be included in the calculation, including e.g. administrative cost to the 
</p>
<p>organization for both options. 
 
Lease versus buy 
The procurement officer should compare the cost of leasing with the cost of buying an identical 
item.  If the terms of the lease include other services, such as operation and maintenance, then 
the cost of obtaining these services separately should be added to the purchase price for the 
purpose of this analysis.  The residual value of the item at the end of the period should also be 
considered.   </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-33 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Each of the steps identified below should be considered in order to determine whether to lease or 
buy. 
 
Step Action 
1 Add up all lease payments for the expected useful life of the equipment. 
2 Add to the proposed purchase price of the equipment any of the following costs 
</p>
<p>that would apply: 
 Installation costs (one-time). 
 Maintenance costs anticipated over the expected useful life of the equipment 
</p>
<p>(cumulative). If the leased equipment includes operator costs, then the 
procurement officer should add to the Buy option the actual costs of operation as 
could be paid by the end-user. 
</p>
<p> Any warranty costs not included in the purchase price (one-time). 
 Estimated delivery charges not included in the purchase price (one-time). 
</p>
<p>3 Subtract the resale value, if any. 
4 Compare the total lease cost (option 1) to the total proposed purchase cost (option 
</p>
<p>2). See the example below. 
5 Select the lower total cost of the two options as the most advantageous acquisition 
</p>
<p>method.  
 
Example 
In the example provided in the table below, option 1: leasing, would provide better value. The 
procurement process would therefore change from buying the particular item to leasing. 
 
Option 1: Lease  Option 2: Buy 
Useful lifetime 5 years  Purchase price $10,750 
Monthly lease $170  Maintenance cost (400/year) $2,000 
   Warranty cost 0 
   Delivery charge $150 
   Resale value ($1,500) 
Total cost to lease $10,200  Total cost to buy $11,400 
</p>
<p> 
Note: If the procurement value is substantial, then Net Present Value (NPV) calculations are 
needed to discount future costs in years 2, 3, 4, etc. to their present value, using the prevailing 
interest rates. This is necessary to compare the present value of the investment in both options 
and select the option that provides the lower NPV. 
 
 
Consideration of indirect buy options 
 
Some indirect buy options that should be considered are: 
 
 use existing long term agreements (LTAs) 
 use &nbsp;other &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;LTAs 
 develop new LTA 
 buy from other Un organizations 
 incorporate in other procurement.

Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-34 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Long Term Agreements (LTAs)  
Long term agreements (LTAs) exist in many forms and go under various names in the different 
UN organizations, including: long term arrangements, long term agreements, framework 
arrangements, systems contracts, requirements contracts, and possibly others. LTAs are usually 
based on the result of a competitive tender exercise. 
 
An LTA is a written agreement between a UN organization and a supplier covering all the 
commercial terms applicable to the orders that may be issued against them for pre-selected goods 
or services: pricing, discounts, payment, delivery and packaging and any other relevant special 
as well as the general terms and conditions.   
 
Depending on the nature of the requirement and the policies of the organization, LTAs are 
typically established on a non-exclusive basis for a specified period of time (e.g. two years) and 
a maximum amount corresponding to a ceiling of aggregate demand volume. LTAs may be with 
a single supplier or several suppliers and may contain one or many line items of products or 
services. In some cases the solicitation may result in immediate placement of an order, or 
commitment to place a specified level of orders, while in others it may only establish the 
framework. 
 
LTAs have been applied to a wide range of requirements, including basic office supplies (paper, 
computers), travel, common field equipment (vehicles, communications), air charter services, 
programme inputs (pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, agricultural commodities and condoms), and 
standard specialized equipment (mine detection equipment). 
 
Some LTAs can only be used by the organization which established them, while others have 
been developed as collaborative procurement arrangements whereby more than one UN 
organization can benefit from pricing arrangements for goods and services established with a 
single supplier.  UN organizations are currently strengthening the role of lead agency for 
products that are important for one organization and relevant for others.  Lead agencies will have 
responsibility to pre-qualify suppliers for their products and eventually to establish LTAs when 
relevant, and other UN organizations will use those pre-qualifications and LTAs for their own 
procurement. 
 
LTAs are developed through a complex solicitation process, which must consider not only the 
quality of the goods/services under consideration, but also the capability of the selected supplier 
to fulfil orders for the full period of coverage.  Due to the added complexity, such solicitation 
processes are normally conducted from headquarters of the organization concerned, and then 
orders may be placed by the various offices around the world. Some organizations allow 
decentralized offices to establish LTAs as well, in particular for goods and services available 
locally/regionally. 
 
While the relevant FRR and procedures vary, most UN organizations make use of long term 
framework agreements (LTAs) to stabilise supply/costs, achieve economies of scale and avoid 
duplication of procurement processes for many goods and services that are required on a regular 
basis but have uncertain quantity and delivery requirements.

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>The benefits of long term agreements include: 
 
 streamlined acquisition process for both the UN organization and supplier 
 fixed prices and conditions based on consolidation of needs and volume, for a certain period of 
</p>
<p>time 
 ease of access to goods and services 
 lower transaction costs because of time and resources saved to obtain offers, evaluate offers 
</p>
<p>and awarding a contract for each requirement (i.e. eliminates requirement for repeated 
bidding). 
</p>
<p> 
The challenges of using LTAs are: 
 
 They may include a premium to cover the fact that they establish fixed prices, and are non 
</p>
<p>exclusive. This can be partly overcome by requesting staircase pricing. 
 Risk to become less attentive to performance monitoring and quality inspection 
 
Use own LTA 
Based on the analysis of the requisition, if the specific requirement fits within the framework 
covered by an existing LTA of the organization, the expedited procedure for procurement under 
the LTA should be followed.  Each organization and LTA has its own specific procedures, and 
the order should be placed with any necessary reporting according to the applicable procedures. 
LTAs should be made widely known and/or accessible within the respective organization.   
 
Organizations should decide whether LTAs are to be used as a matter of normal procedure 
whenever they apply, or if this is an option to be decided in each case by the procurement 
officer. LTAs are established to ensure stability of supply and price while economising on use of 
procurement officers time; the decision to not use an LTA is a decision to expend more staff time 
on the individual requirement and should be justified in the procurement file. On the other hand, 
it may be appropriate to go outside the LTA in some cases, e.g., when procuring a large quantity 
in comparison to that of the LTA, or when substantially lower unit prices can be obtained due to 
changes in the supply market since conclusion of the LTA. It is good practice for each 
organization to have guidelines for such determinations.  
 
Use &nbsp;other &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;LTA 
While in some cases two organizations may have LTAs for the same goods or services (e.g. 
office supplies), which could be unified in a common services framework, more often the LTAs 
of an organization reflect its mandate and programme requirements.  When another organization 
faces the same requirement, it may wish to utilize the existing LTA. A list of LTAs open to be 
used by other UN organizations is available at the UNGM website. 
 
There are specific procedures to follow for the use of the LTA of another organization, and these 
should be fully complied with. Organizations vary in their policies of accepting the LTAs of 
others, and in accepting the use of their LTAs by others.  There are many reasons for this, but 
key among them are concern that: 
 
 The LTA may be based on specific requirements (higher than normal quality standards, shorter 
</p>
<p>delivery time etc), and if this is not required, value for money could be lost. Particular care 
should be taken for large value contracts, where bidding may get a better result. 
</p>
<p> LTA created for specific requirements and purposes by one organization could be exhausted 
and no longer available when required, due to the action of the second organization. </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p> Production capacity of suppliers could be taken to its limit by the second organization resulting 
in delays. 
</p>
<p> Procedures and relations with suppliers built up over time could be damaged by inadvertent 
actions of second organization. 
</p>
<p> 
While UN organizations have generally agreed to accept and promote collaborative procurement, 
it is still challenging.  Reasons like the above influence the willingness of UN organizations to 
cooperate in procurement, and are discussed on a bilateral basis between procurement officers of 
the respective organizations interested in specific procurement requirements, and reviewed as a 
system-wide policy concern within the framework of the IAPWG. 
 
Develop new LTA 
There may be situations where the procurement officer believes that supply of a certain good or 
service would benefit from being organised through an LTA.  With appropriate internal 
consultation, the organization may conclude that it wishes to develop an LTA or collaborate with 
an appropriate lead agency in its development.  
 
Buy from other UN organizations 
In addition to using the LTA of another organization, it is possible to procure from other UN 
organizations as suppliers (e.g. UNICEF catalogue) or to outsource procurement to them (e.g. 
IAPSO, UNFPA and UNOPS).  Such arrangements are subjected to an added fee charged by the 
supplying organization, which may be offset by more rapid response, possibly lower product 
costs, and less administrative time spent on procurement by the organization (internal saving).   
 
There &nbsp;is &nbsp;significant &nbsp;variation &nbsp;among &nbsp;organizations&rsquo; &nbsp;approach &nbsp;to &nbsp;this &nbsp;process. &nbsp; &nbsp;For &nbsp;some, &nbsp;this &nbsp;may &nbsp;
be considered the subject of an inter-agency agreement outside of procurement; others may 
consider it a competitive procurement process; others may require that the UN organization 
submit a bid as part of the solicitation process and be selected according to standard criteria.  
Procurement officers should know and follow the policies of their own organization regarding 
procurement to be undertaken by other organizations. 
 
Incorporate in other procurement 
Specific requests could appropriately be included within another solicitation for the same 
requisitioner (e.g. including in the SOW for an extended contract that the supplier provide own 
vehicles and communications devices, according to standards of the organization in the country) 
or grouped with other similar requisitions.  The procurement officer, in consultation with the 
requisitioner, should determine whether this is appropriate.  
 
This option may be chosen to reduce the administrative burden on the unit concerned and to 
make the supplier fully responsible for their own effectiveness, especially if it is believed that 
likely suppliers of the service have ready and low cost access to the required goods/services. 
 
 
Choice of solicitation method 
 
There are the following three main solicitation methods used in the United Nations: 
 
 Request for Quotations &ndash; RFQ 
 Invitation to Bid &ndash; ITB 
 Request for Proposals &ndash; RFP </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-37 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>The selection of the appropriate method is determined by the expected cost of the procurement 
action, the feasibility of preparing complete specifications at the outset of the requirement 
definition, and whether or not price alone or price plus other criteria such as quality should 
determine the selection among qualified suppliers. 
 
Request for quotations (RFQ)  
Request for quotations (RFQs) are used for low dollar value purchases and well defined products 
and services. As the name suggests, this involves requesting a price for the supply of basic 
standard goods, simple services or works. There may be a requirement to obtain three quotations, 
although the process is not sealed and there is normally not a rigid deadline for submission of 
quotations. The basis of award is normally to the lowest price, fully responsive and compliant 
bid. Policy and exact wording can vary between organizations.  
 
Depending on the organization, for very low dollar value procurement (below the first threshold 
for procurement, typically in the USD 100 to USD 2,500 range), the RFQ may be sent to only 
one or two suppliers and their price confirmed by the procurement officer against past purchases. 
The RFQ is used by all organizations for procurement up to the financial threshold for ITBs/ 
RFPs, in most cases below USD 20,000 and USD 30,000. 
 
Invitation to bid (ITB) and request for proposal (RFP) 
Invitation to bid (ITB) and request for proposal (RFP) are two distinct methods of soliciting 
offers. The following sections focus on the similarities and differences between these two 
methods. 
 
ITBs and RFPs similarities 
Although ITBs and RFPs represent two distinct methods of soliciting bids and proposals, they do 
have much in common. Both methods can be used for procurement of any value whatsoever.  
Both are formal methods of soliciting competition.  Although organizations do vary in their 
procedures and practice, both methods generally involve the submission of sealed/secure 
submissions due by a publicly announced deadline. Both methods aim for a contractual 
agreement between buyer and seller. Each method should incorporate a draft/sample contract in 
the solicitation documents as well as the solicitation provisions. 
 
ITBs and RFPs differences 
While there are similarities between ITBs and RFPs, the differences are extremely important.  
The differences help determine which would be the more appropriate procurement method for a 
given solicitation. 
 
ITB 
The essential characteristic of the ITB is that technical requirement can be clearly and 
completely specified in a qualitatively and quantitatively manner, and the award is normally 
made on the basis of lowest cost, among commercially and technically compliant bids. Offers are 
normally provided in a single envelope, and the price can be read out at a public bid opening. 
 
This necessitates (and assumes) that: 
 Negotiations are not foreseen to be required. 
 No premium is to be given for bids that exceed the specified technical requirement (only RFP 
</p>
<p>can consider different qualities of responsive proposals). 
 Other requirements can be specified in yes/no form as threshold qualifying conditions. </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-38 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p> Delivery requirements can be specified in a manner to adjust price (e.g. 0.5% increase or 
decrease per week) if relevant.   
</p>
<p> Some organizations allow weighted scoring to be used to determine compliance. In such case 
good practice would be to use a two-envelope system to prevent knowledge of the price from 
influencing the technical evaluation. 
</p>
<p> 
RFP 
The essential characteristic of the RFP is that proposals are submitted against requirements that 
are not fully definable at the time of solicitation and where innovation and the specific expertise 
of the proposer is being sought to better meet the procurement requirement. Proposals are usually 
submitted with technical and financial components in separate sealed envelopes, therefore there 
is normally no public bid opening. 
 
This implies that proposals will be evaluated technically: 
 prior to opening the financial offer  
 on several factors, with a final weighted score for the overall technical offer. This score will 
</p>
<p>then be weighted again with the financial score.  
 
In summary 
 In an ITB, suppliers submit an offer to provide a product or service strictly as it is described in 
</p>
<p>the solicitation documents.  ITBs are used by UN organizations for most competitive 
procurement of goods and standard works. 
</p>
<p> In an RFP, suppliers may offer alternative approaches to providing the required product or 
service.  In other words, suppliers have an opportunity to be innovative in their proposals, and 
the RFP should make this opportunity clear.  RFPs are used by UN organizations for 
competitive procurement of services, complex goods and complex works. 
</p>
<p> In some organizations, the use of negotiations following a competitive process is linked to the 
choice of methodology. Please see Unit 3.7 Evaluation for more information. 
</p>
<p> 
 
Selecting the type of competition 
 
In addition to selecting the solicitation method to be used (described above), selecting the type of 
competition for a procurement activity is an important step. Depending on the value of the 
procurement, the market conditions as well as knowledge of the market, various types of 
competition can be used. A choice must be made &nbsp;whether &nbsp;to &nbsp;use &nbsp;&lsquo;open &nbsp;competition&rsquo; &nbsp;where &nbsp;any &nbsp;
supplier &nbsp;can &nbsp;participate, &nbsp;or &nbsp;&lsquo;limited/restricted &nbsp;competition&rsquo;, &nbsp;where &nbsp;a &nbsp;short &nbsp;list &nbsp;and &nbsp;specific &nbsp;
invitation is provided to selected suppliers. Further, a decision should be made on geographic 
sourcing and whether international competition is to be used, or whether to limit competition to 
local or regional suppliers. 
 
While some organizations (e.g. the World Bank) require open competition for all solicitations 
over specified thresholds, most UN organizations often apply a process of limited/restrictive 
competition based on short lists.  UN organizations generally have the following concerns which 
need to be balanced: 
 
 Obtaining best value offers from a sufficient number of qualified suppliers. 
 Fairness to all suppliers from all countries. </p>

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p> Avoiding additional administrative burden beyond the level of likely improvement in the 
results of the competitive process. 
</p>
<p> 
The procurement procedures of each organization will indicate the expected number of invitees 
to be short listed for different thresholds of procurement value, as well as the policy for when 
open tender is required or recommended. 
 
Open international competition  
Open international competition intends to provide all eligible and qualified suppliers adequate 
and timely notification of the requirements, and to provide them equal access and fair 
opportunity to compete for contracts of required goods, works, or services.  
 
Open international tenders is the preferred mode of conducting competitive tender processes in 
some organizations. Other organizations find that the need for openness and transparency can be 
covered by publishing procurement plans, frequent use of REOI and notice of pre-qualification 
etc (see Unit 3.3 Sourcing for further information). 
 
Open tenders &nbsp;are &nbsp;usually &nbsp;advertised &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;website, &nbsp;along &nbsp;with &nbsp;other &nbsp;appropriate &nbsp;
means. It is important to consider which means would reach the right suppliers in a broad way. A 
combination of several means is often useful. 
 
For further information on advertising in general, please refer to Unit 3.3 Sourcing. 
 
Limited international competition  
Limited international competition allows only the participation of selected suppliers in the 
solicitation.  Limited international competition restricts competition to a short list of suppliers 
selected in a non-discriminatory manner from rosters, pre-qualifications, EOI, market research, 
etc.  
 
Local/regional competition  
UN organizations aim at fostering the development of local markets, and if procurement 
requirements can be satisfactorily met within a local context, local/regional competition can be 
undertaken.  Local/regional tenders are typically conducted in the following cases: 
 
 when works are scattered geographically or spread over time, and the works would therefore 
</p>
<p>typically not be of interest to international companies  
 when goods are available locally at prices below the global market price 
 if knowledge of the local/national system is a requirement 
 if justified by the requisitioner and/or client, or specified in the project agreement. 
 
It is, however, essential to ensure competitiveness in the process, thus, local/regional competition 
should only be used if there are enough suppliers of the goods/services in the area to ensure 
competition, whether through open or limited local/regional competition. 
 
Waiver of competitive bidding 
The FRR of all UN organizations stipulate that competition is normally the most effective 
method to ensure best value for money. Nonetheless, the FRR also recognise that exceptions 
may be made for circumstances in which competitive bidding would not provide an adequate 
response for the organization and its clients.

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-40 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>The requisitioner and/or procurement officer should provide a justification for the waiver of 
competitive bidding in line with the FRR and procurement procedures of the specific 
organization. In most organizations, this justification can only be approved by the Chief 
Procurement Officer, typically with the advice of the contracts committee. In some 
organizations, authority to approve waivers for procurement actions below a certain threshold 
may be included in some delegations of authority.  
 
 
Justification for waivers 
While specific organizational policies and procedures vary, a waiver of competitive bidding must 
be approved for one of a limited number of formally established reasons.  The range of such 
justifications may include the ones listed in the table below, although some organizations may 
not recognise all of the reasons indicated.   In all cases and organizations, the allowable 
justifications must be supported in writing and approved at the appropriate level.  The 
justification for some reasons should be provided by the requisitioner (standardization, 
procurement from government entity, exigency, procurement of essential professional services 
and continuation of services), and by the procurement officer for the justifications based upon 
market conditions. 
 
Reason Explanation 
Low value Most organizations recognise that purchases valued less than a certain 
</p>
<p>threshold (varies, e.g. $100, $500, $1,000, $2,500) may be conducted 
without formal bidding, although there is a professional responsibility 
for due diligence to ascertain prices are reasonable.  
</p>
<p>No competitive market 
place 
</p>
<p>This may be due to supply by an officially recognised monopoly; 
prices fixed by government legislation/regulation; requirement 
involves a proprietary service or product; underlying project 
documents identify a sole provider to be contracted.   
</p>
<p>Procurement from 
Government entity 
 
</p>
<p>Some organizations consider this a sufficient reason to waive 
competitive solicitation. This is particularly applicable when the 
purpose of the project is to support the entity. 
</p>
<p>Standardization 
 
</p>
<p>The end-user has standardized on a certain brand (it may still be 
possible to select competitively among alternate suppliers of that 
brand).   
</p>
<p>Cooperation with 
other UN organization 
</p>
<p>Some organizations consider this to be a waiver of competitive 
bidding, while others consider it to be a product of competitive 
bidding.   
</p>
<p>Piggy backing on 
recent competition 
</p>
<p>Offers for identical requirements were recently obtained competitively 
(e.g., within a certain number of months), prices and conditions are 
unchanged and remain competitive.   
</p>
<p>Recent competition 
failed 
</p>
<p>Effort to obtain identical requirements through competition failed to 
provide satisfactory results 
</p>
<p>Purchase or lease of 
real property 
</p>
<p>Real estate property is recognised as discrete and unique and thus not 
suitable for competitive bidding. 
</p>
<p>Exigency, urgency, 
emergency 
 
</p>
<p>A genuine exigency for the requirement, in which serious adverse 
impacts would result from delivery delays normally associated with 
competitive solicitation.  Most organizations do not accept that the 
rationale &nbsp;of &nbsp;&ldquo;emergency&rdquo; &nbsp;applies &nbsp;if &nbsp;the &nbsp;situation &nbsp;is &nbsp;the &nbsp;result &nbsp;of poor 
planning by project management or procurement officers.   </p>

</p>
<p>The Chief Procurement Officer determines that formal solicitation will 
not give satisfactory results.  This should normally be for one of the 
preceding reasons, but there could be others. 
</p>
<p> 
Procurement process for waivers 
Even if only one supplier will be invited to present an offer, a formal solicitation should be 
issued. Good practice is to adapt one of the standard solicitation documents to the required 
purpose, and use this to request an offer. This means that the same considerations should be 
made in terms of sample contract, general and special conditions, evaluation method etc. For 
more information see Unit 3.5 Preparation and Issuance of Solicitation Documents. Furthermore, 
evaluation, negotiation and contract formulation is equally or even more important in waiver 
situations. 
 
 
Decision on type of contract to be signed 
 
One crucial element to address during the strategy phase is to determine the type of contract to 
be used, in particular whether it should be a purchase order (PO), contract for services or 
contract for works. Other issues such as whether the contract should be fixed price (lump sum) or 
cost reimbursable are also considered at this stage. The type of contracts and availability of 
standard contracts varies between organizations.

<p>3.5 Preparation and Issuance of Solicitation Documents 
 
Introduction 
 
Solicitation documents are the documents used to request potential suppliers to offer a quotation, 
bid or proposal to provide the required goods, services or works.   
 
Preparation of solicitation documents covers the process of assembling and formalising the 
information and documentation necessary for potential suppliers to prepare responsive and easily 
comparable offers, consistent with the requirement and procurement strategy.  
 
Procurement &nbsp;officers &nbsp;should &nbsp;ensure &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;solicitation &nbsp;documents &nbsp;create &nbsp;a &nbsp;&ldquo;level &nbsp;playing &nbsp;field&rdquo;, &nbsp;
i.e. all potential suppliers receive the same information at the same time, to prepare offers; 
measurable evaluation criteria that will allow suppliers the same chances to receive the contract 
award; ensure that commercial risks are fairly distributed between the UN organization and 
eventual supplier; ensure that the terms of the eventual contract are clearly expressed and thus 
suppliers understand the rights and obligations they will be expected to enter into. All 
requirements should be clearly expressed in terms that are conducive to receive a sufficient 
number &nbsp;of &nbsp;responsive &nbsp;offers &nbsp;so &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;outcome &nbsp;will &nbsp;best &nbsp;meet &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;needs. &nbsp; 
Procedures &nbsp;should &nbsp;be &nbsp;clearly &nbsp;expressed &nbsp;to &nbsp;avoid &nbsp;unnecessary &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;officer&rsquo;s &nbsp;time &nbsp;in &nbsp;
explanations.  
 
During this stage, evaluation criteria are developed and formulated to obtain the best value in the 
specific case. This includes informing the potential suppliers regarding: 
 
 Administrative rules for the solicitation process, including the evaluation criteria and method 
</p>
<p>(Instruction to Suppliers). 
 Function, performance requirements and/or physical characteristics of the 
</p>
<p>goods/works/services needed, including a clear statement of minimum quality requirements 
(schedule of requirements and technical specifications). 
</p>
<p> Commercial, legal and other conditions prescribed by the buyer (contract terms and 
conditions).  
</p>
<p> 
Note: Preparation of the evaluation criteria &ndash; the basis upon which all offers will be compared to 
achieve the best result for the organization and fair treatment of all candidates &ndash; requires special 
attention.

<p>Process 
 
The flowchart below shows each of the stages in the preparation and issuance of solicitation 
documents process. 
 
 
</p>
<p> 
Each stage in the process includes review and decisions intended to guarantee the effectiveness 
of the specific procurement process. On the basis of the selection of the procurement method, 
this phase starts with review of standard documents and past experience from similar cases in 
this field of procurement. 
 
 
Selection of solicitation document 
 
Organizations have different standard documents. It is good practice to have at least separate 
standard solicitation documents for each procurement method i.e. RFQ, RFP and ITB. In some 
organizations the choice of standard solicitation document automatically implies a choice of 
general conditions, contractual terms, etc. It is important to ensure that all parts of the standard 
document fit the requirement (e.g. appropriate general terms and conditions). The use of standard 
documents achieves the following: 
 
 ensures consistency from one transaction to another 
 avoids repetition and omissions 
 streamlines the process. 
 
Standard solicitation documents must be customised to reflect the specific nature of the 
requirement. Special attention should be given to the following areas: 
 
 clarity and completeness of requirements and delivery terms and any particular conditions 
</p>
<p>governing the supply to the destination 
 evaluation and selection method and criteria  
 special terms and conditions 
 contract type.

</p>
<p> 
Preparation of content for the solicitation documents 
 
The content of solicitation documents varies from one organization to another and according to 
the procurement method and complexity of the requirement.  The document structure, however, 
generally includes some or all of the following items: 
 
 Letter of invitation. 
 Instruction to suppliers. 
 Schedule of requirements. 
 Technical description (specifications, TOR, SOW including design/drawings/BoQ and 
</p>
<p>technical specifications for works). 
 General terms and conditions. 
 Special terms and conditions. 
 Sample contract and other forms. 
 
For an RFQ, the above items are often reduced to a letter of request, a short description of the 
requirement, and a reference to the applicable general terms and conditions of the particular UN 
organization. 
 
ITBs and RFPs normally include each of the above items separately identified. In some 
solicitation documents the letter of invitation and the instruction to suppliers is combined. The 
following documents should be part of the solicitation documents: 
 
 Letter of invitation/instruction to suppliers 
 Schedule of requirements/requirement definition 
 Contractual terms (general conditions, special conditions, sample contract) 
 Offer submission form. 
 
Letter of invitation/instruction to suppliers 
The letter of invitation provides key information to enable potential suppliers to decide whether 
they might be interested in participating. The instruction to suppliers should be drafted to reflect 
the specific requirement of the solicitation. As shown in the table below, the letter or 
invitation/instruction to suppliers should convey all relevant guidelines to govern the 
preparation, submission and evaluation of responsive offers, in accordance with the requirements 
of the organization. It should indicate all documents required to constitute a complete 
submission, and the warning that submissions may be rejected unless substantially responsive.   
 
Topic Information &nbsp;and/or &nbsp;instructions &nbsp;should &nbsp;include&hellip; 
Invitation to offer Reference to the specific procurement (title and tracking number), and a 
</p>
<p>list of supporting documents issued.  
Deadline for

</p>
<p> The date, time and place for submission, together with the location,

</p>
<p>Instructions on offer 
validity 
</p>
<p>Instructions requesting the suppliers to keep their offers valid for a 
specific number of days, (typically a period of 60 or 90 days, but less if 
the price of the procured product fluctuates rapidly (e.g. raw materials, 
petroleum products, etc.) allowing time for evaluation of offers, and 
award of contract.

<p>Method of 
evaluation and 
evaluation criteria 
</p>
<p>Method including order of importance and weight of each major

</p>
<p> 
 
Method of evaluation and evaluation criteria 
The purpose of establishing correct evaluation criteria is to: 
 Compare the merits of offers that can vary widely in form and substance, in other words 
develop &nbsp;the &nbsp;ability &nbsp;to &nbsp;compare &nbsp;&ldquo;apples &nbsp;with &nbsp;apples&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p> Minimize the &nbsp;UN&rsquo;s &nbsp;risk &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;selected &nbsp;supplier &nbsp;will &nbsp;not &nbsp;be &nbsp;able &nbsp;to &nbsp;perform &nbsp;the &nbsp;contract &nbsp;
satisfactorily.  
</p>
<p> Identify the best match to the requirement. 
 
Pass/fail criteria 
When an evaluation factor requires an attribute that is not conducive to varying degrees of 
superiority or inferiority, a pass/fail factor is appropriate. When a factor merely requires an 
acceptance or rejection, it is termed pass/fail (or compliant/non-compliant), or a threshold 
condition. &nbsp;In &nbsp;principle, &nbsp;an &nbsp;offer &nbsp;that &nbsp;&ldquo;fails&rdquo; &nbsp;would &nbsp;be &nbsp;disqualified, while an offer that greatly 
exceeds the requirement would be ranked the same as one that just meets that same requirement.

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-46 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p> 
Weighted criteria 
Variable factors (weighted scoring) evaluate the quality or extent to which offers meet the 
requirement. When a competitive solicitation seeks the best value from submitted offers, it is 
appropriate to evaluate the degree to which each offered product or service contains preferable 
characteristics. The higher the degree, the more advantageous it is. Variable factors may be 
expressed in terms of numerical ratings, such as a scale of 1 through 5, with 5 being the highest 
rating. A variable factor can have a pass/fail aspect, with a required minimum and points for 
exceeding the minimum.    
 
Weights should be determined by importance for award. As an example, a weighted scoring 
(technical/financial) for selection of professional services in which price has been given a weight 
of 25%, means that if a technical proposal is 12.5% better than the lowest cost one (one-sixth the 
total possible technical points), it would justify 100% higher price. Whereas, if price has a 40% 
weight, it would require a 20% difference in technical scores (one-third of the total possible) to 
justify a price twice as high as the lowest. Greater weight to price requires larger difference in 
technical scores to justify the proportionate higher cost. 
 
When weighted criteria are used for technical evaluations, the weighting ratio between various 
criteria should be disclosed in the solicitation documents. The level of detail should enable 
suppliers to understand on which grounds their offer will be judged, and indicate which areas 
they should explore in their offers. 
 
Characteristics of successful evaluation criteria 
The evaluation criteria spell out the rules of the game by which all offers will be compared and 
ensures fair treatment of all suppliers. Good evaluation criteria should possess the following 
qualities: 
 valid 
 objective  
 measurable 
 impartial. 
 
Valid criteria  
Valid criteria are related to the required performance, i.e. the feature being evaluated will be 
critical in the execution of the contract; for example the selected supplier will have to have 
certain language capabilities because of the country where the assignment will take place. Valid 
criteria result in the assignment of a higher ranking to those suppliers who actually have a 
relatively high probability of successfully performing the work. If criteria do not clearly relate to 
the requirements in the solicitation, they are probably not valid. If it is reasonable to assume that 
all suppliers will score well on a factor, then it would not be a valid significant differentiator and 
its inclusion may not serve any useful purpose, except for evaluating a pass/fail requirement. 
 
Objective criteria  
Objective criteria ensure that offers are evaluated consistently, even if they are evaluated by 
different evaluators, and that a third party can ascertain that the offer or the supplier has certain 
features; for example, after sales service in the country. 
 
Measurable criteria  
Measurable criteria allow evaluators to assign rankings or make pass/fail judgements effectively. 
For example, honesty would not be a measurable factor because it is impossible to verify it in a </p>

</p>
<p>reliable manner. Measurable criteria can be assigned points against degrees of achievement, for 
example, one point per year of experience or, one point per similar project in the region, up to a 
set maximum of points. 
 
Impartial criteria  
Impartial criteria do not give an unfair advantage to one supplier over another, nor are they 
tailored around the attributes of favoured suppliers. For example, if an incumbent supplier has 10 
years&rsquo; &nbsp;experience &nbsp;in &nbsp;offering &nbsp;a &nbsp;specific &nbsp;service &nbsp;in &nbsp;a &nbsp;particular &nbsp;country &nbsp;or &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN, &nbsp;it &nbsp;may &nbsp;be &nbsp;
inappropriate to use such criterion as a pass/fail minimum. Doing so would exclude other 
established suppliers who have more limited track record of dealing with the country or the UN, 
but are/were successful in delivering a number of even larger consignments/services in the 
region and to various buyers. The evaluation criteria should be impartial and open to new 
providers with reliable performance records. 
 
Letter of invitation/instruction to suppliers, continued. 
Further topics and instructions to be included in the letter of invitation/instruction to suppliers 
are listed in the table below. 
 
Topic Information &nbsp;and/or &nbsp;instructions &nbsp;should &nbsp;include&hellip; 
Discrepancies 
and errors in the 
price 
component. 
</p>
<p>How discrepancies and errors in the price component will be handled. E.g. 
errors in total price: The unit prices should govern, when errors in totalling 
have been made. Where there is discrepancy between the amounts in figures 
and in words, the amount in words will govern. 
</p>
<p>Payment terms. The payment terms, usually Net 30 days upon receipt of invoice as well as 
receipt and acceptance of goods or services or upon receipt of required 
shipping documentation, depending on the Incoterm used (see Unit 4.3 
Logistics). Standard solicitation documents usually also request suppliers to 
indicate discounts offered for shorter payment terms. Shorter payment terms 
can also be practice for certain commodities and large value purchases. UN 
organizations usually do not make advance payments, except when deemed 
regular practice in the industry or for reasons specifically justified in the 
particular context. The policy should be outlined in the solicitation 
documents. Progress payments is common practice for services and works. 
</p>
<p>Modifications  Any additional information, clarification, correction of errors or changes 
made to solicitation documents will be distributed to all suppliers prior to 
the deadline for receipt in order to enable suppliers to take appropriate 
actions.  
</p>
<p> Information to suppliers concerning the right to modify or make 
corrections to offers, provided that any such modification or corrections 
are received in writing prior to the time specified for submission of offers.

and offer 
security form 
</p>
<p>If applicable, offer securities that can be requested to ensure that the supplier 
is willing to enter into contract on the basis of the offer it has submitted.  
Offer securities reduce the risk of frivolous offers.  
Offer securities are used when there is reason to expect that offers may be 
submitted by a supplier unable to fulfil the offer in the terms made, for 
example when there is an experience of initial costs being revised. The 
amount of the offer security should be set at a lump sum figure equivalent to 
between 2% and 3% of the expected cost. The amount should not be posed 
as a percentage of the offer price as the value of the offer security would 
give an indication of the value of the unopened offer. When required, offer </p>

<p> Performance securities can be requested from the selected supplier to 
ensure performance by the supplier in terms of delivery of all equipment, 
services rendered, and works completed as per the contract.  
</p>
<p> Performance securities are typically requested in works contracts and 
highly sensitive consulting contracts and are typically set at 10% of the 
value of the contract, but can also be requested for the full contract value 
with certain criteria for cashing.

<p> It is used in complex procurement where the cost of establishing a contract 
is high and the impact of non performance by supplier could inflict serious 
damage to the UN.

<p> Altgernative offers are offers that do not comply with the exact 
requirements of the solicitation, but which may be proposed by suppliers 
as an optional way of fulfilling the needs of the end-user. 
</p>
<p> Policies that can be used  when dealing with alternative offers, such as:  
 alternative offers are not accepted 
 alternative offers can be considered only if they are alternative offers to 
</p>
<p>the lowest compliant offer 
 suppliers &nbsp;who &nbsp;believe &nbsp;that &nbsp;they &nbsp;can &nbsp;satisfy &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;needs &nbsp;by &nbsp;
</p>
<p>offering alternative products or services that differ from the required 
specifications should inform the buyer thereof before the submission 
deadline. If the UN organization believes that the proposed alternative 
products/services are acceptable, the organization should change the 
mandatory requirements of the solicitation documents and inform all 
invitees accordingly. 
</p>
<p> Taking into account the policy of the organization, the solicitation 
document should specify which policy is applicable for the specific 
solicitation. 
</p>
<p> For the procurement of services undertaken through RFP processes, 
alternative offers are commonly acceptable.

</p>
<p>Schedule of requirements/requirement definition 
Review specifications and other requirements to ensure they are complete. Organize and present 
the following content in a logical format for clear supplier understanding and response. 
 
1.  Technical specifications, terms of reference (TOR), or statement of works (SOW), and bill 
</p>
<p>of quantities (BoQ). 
 
 The requirements must be clearly defined in the solicitation documents. Depending on the 
</p>
<p>nature of the procurement, the requirements are stated in the form of technical 
specifications, TOR, or SOW/BoQ (for guidance on writing requirements see Unit 3.2). 
</p>
<p> 
 A clear and detailed description of the performance expected is important in order to 
</p>
<p>prevent misunderstandings and disagreements with suppliers at the time of contract 
execution.  
</p>
<p> 
 Ambiguous performance requirements may also lead to increased costs as suppliers may 
</p>
<p>have to factor into their offer a contingency or risk buffer reflected in the price. 
 
2.  Delivery date for goods or starting/completion dates for deliveries of services/works where 
</p>
<p>there are specific requirements or time is critical. 
 
 If early delivery is considered to warrant a premium, this can be done through specifying a 
</p>
<p>target delivery period, within an acceptable earliest and latest permissible range of delivery 
dates, and then applying a percentage adjustment to the price for each day/week/month of 
delay from the optimal delivery date, but within the permissible range of dates. Offers 
outside the prescribed delivery period should then be rejected as non responsive. To the 
extent possible, the adjustment factor should be considered against the cost implications of 
delay, such as equipment rental for the period. When delivery is a factor in the evaluation, 
consider a performance bond and closely monitor actual delivery during the contract 
management phase, with appropriate remedies applied. The remedies have to be specified 
in the terms and conditions, and in no case can be less than the price advantage specified in 
the evaluation criteria for early delivery. 
</p>
<p> 
3.  Destinations/locations/mode of transport. When procuring goods, the destination(s), and 
</p>
<p>mode of transport(s), should be included. When procuring services the exact location(s) 
should be specified.  
</p>
<p> 
4.  Delivery terms. Incoterms 2000 should be used to specify the delivery of goods procured. 
</p>
<p>(see Unit 4.3 Logistics for more information). 
 
</p>
<p>The scope of Incoterms is limited to matters relating to the rights and obligations of the 
parties to the contract of sale with respect to the costs and risks related to the delivery of 
goods sold. They specify where the seller delivers the goods, what costs the seller pays, 
and when the seller passes the transit risk to the buyer. Procurement officers may request 
suppliers to quote supply under more than one Incoterm, for example when considering 
whether to contract freight through the supplier or independently.

<p>Contractual terms (general conditions, special conditions, sample contract) 
The table below provides information and instructions on what contractual terms and conditions 
should include. 
 
Item/topic Information &nbsp;and/or &nbsp;instructions &nbsp;should &nbsp;include&hellip; 
General 
conditions 
</p>
<p> A copy of the relevant general conditions either with the solicitation 
documents, or refer to the general conditions available on the 
organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;website &nbsp;(an &nbsp;easy &nbsp;option &nbsp;of &nbsp;access &nbsp;for &nbsp;suppliers &nbsp;who &nbsp;cannot &nbsp;
access the internet should always be provided).  
</p>
<p> Which conditions the suppliers are expected to accept if signing a contract 
with the UN organization.  
</p>
<p> Note: See to Unit 3.9 Contract Finalization for more information on the 
General Conditions. 
</p>
<p>Special terms 
and conditions 
</p>
<p> Particular contractual requirements linked to the special circumstances of 
the specific procurement. These often constitute exceptions to the general 
terms and conditions or further deliberation on some of the conditions. 
</p>
<p> Note: When preparing solicitation documents for LTAs intended for 
sharing with other organizations, a clause stating that other UN 
organizations may use the LTA should be included. 
</p>
<p>Model contract  A copy of the relevant model contract (i.e. purchase order, contract for 
services, contract for works etc.) with the solicitation documents.  
</p>
<p> Some organizations have specific model contracts for e.g. air charter, 
cleaning, travel, security for specific types of services/goods/works. 
</p>
<p> The standard contract allows suppliers to understand the type of contract 
they would be expected to sign if selected as a supplier (no surprise rule). 
</p>
<p>Packing and 
shipping 
instruction 
</p>
<p>A copy of the relevant packing and shipping instruction with the solicitation 
documents when procuring goods. 
Note: The packing and shipping instructions is of essence to the supplier 
when offering, as it includes instructions to the supplier about packaging, 
marking and numbering of the shipment, notification of shipment, 
documentation required for custom clearance and payment purposes.  
</p>
<p>Contract pricing  The type of contract pricing, i.e. fixed price/lump sum or cost 
reimbursable, or a combination thereof. 
</p>
<p> The UN usually prefers lump sum contracts, as this modality reduces the 
risk for the buyer. However, in exceptional cases, cost reimbursable 
contracts are required or preferable.  
</p>
<p> The use of cost reimbursable contracts increases the need for control and 
monitoring of the supplier. 
</p>
<p> A formula for price escalation should be established, if needed. This can 
be relevant in cases where the supplier needs to use raw material where the 
market price is known to fluctuate, e.g. oil. Then there should be a pre-
established formula for how the price should be calculated at a future time 
in the contract. Formula for price escalation might also be needed for long 
term contracts in high inflation countries. 
</p>
<p>Insurance 
policies 
</p>
<p>The scope of various insurance policies (materials, equipment, personnel, 
supervisors and visitors, buildings (as they are being erected)) as outlined in 
the general conditions of the organization.  
Note: Care should be taken to check that they are appropriate for the

</p>
<p>Penalty 
clause/liquidated 
damages 
</p>
<p> A clause stating the consequences of non-performance or late 
performance, if necessary.  
</p>
<p> For example, if the supplier fails to complete the works within the time 
specified in the contract, the supplier should pay the procuring entity 
liquidated damages for each calendar day of delay (define a percentage) of 
the price of the contract, up to a maximum percentage of the final price of 
the contract. The procuring entity should be entitled to deduct any 
liquidated &nbsp;damages &nbsp;from &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;outstanding &nbsp;invoices, &nbsp;if &nbsp;any. 
</p>
<p> 
Offer submission form 
The &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;offer &nbsp;must &nbsp;be &nbsp;signed &nbsp;by &nbsp;a &nbsp;duly &nbsp;authorized &nbsp;signatory, &nbsp;in &nbsp;order &nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;offer &nbsp;to &nbsp;be &nbsp;
legally binding.  
 
Solicitation documents should contain a standard offer submission form to be signed and 
returned &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;offer. &nbsp; 
 
Finalization of solicitation documents 
 
Solicitation documents should be finalized by crosschecking the draft components for 
consistency and completeness, confirming that sufficient time has been allowed to suppliers, and 
preparing the final solicitation package to facilitate supplier submission and offer evaluation. 
 
At this point it is important to ensure that all terms and conditions applicable to the purchase 
activity are included, as no additional clauses can be added after bid closure (no surprise rule). 
 
The solicitation package should be completed by attaching the appropriate series of forms that 
allow the suppliers to submit offers in a consistent fashion, and confirm their acceptance of the 
type of contractual arrangements proposed by the UN, for example, include forms to: 
 
 confirm intent to submit offer and/or provide reason for declining to participate 
 submit offers for: 
 technical offer 
 financial offer 
 acceptance of terms under which the contract will be issued, noting any exceptions (if 
</p>
<p>allowed). 
 
 
Approval of solicitation documents 
 
The solicitation documents must be approved by the appropriate authority. 
 
 
Issuance/distribution of solicitation documents 
 
The solicitation documents should be issued and distributed simultaneously to all suppliers, 
either by mail, courier, fax, or email, or be made available electronically on the Internet, in case 
of open tender.

</p>
<p>In a limited competitive process, where only selected suppliers may participate in the 
solicitation, the solicitation documents should solely be made available to the suppliers on the 
shortlist. The shortlist must be approved by the appropriate authority prior to issuance of 
solicitation documents. 
 
Confidentiality of the short list 
In the case of a limited competitive bidding where the solicitation documents are only being 
made available to a shortlist of selected suppliers, the names of any short listed supplier should 
not be disclosed, in order to safeguard the principle of competition that the solicitation process is 
aimed at satisfying; i.e. to avoid collusion. For services and works, it may be good practice to 
inform the short listed suppliers of the number of short listed suppliers, to encourage their 
participation.  
 
 
Clarifications/offer conference 
 
The period between the issuance of solicitation documents and the deadline for submitting offers 
is referred to as the solicitation period when a formal method of solicitation is used. 
 
Queries from suppliers 
During the solicitation period, no communication regarding the contents of the solicitation 
documents or the offers should take place between the recipients of the solicitation documents 
and the UN organization, except through the methods of handling queries described below. 
 
Queries from suppliers should be handled by written correspondence and/or by a pre-offer 
conference.  
 
Any supplier requiring clarifications to the solicitation documents should submit their queries in 
writing. The UN organization should prepare and dispatch written replies to such queries, and 
make all replies known, together with the text of the queries, to all suppliers, without disclosing 
the source of the queries. 
 
For technical, complex acquisitions, a pre-offer conference between the organization and the 
suppliers could be held in addition to, or instead of, issuance of written clarifications. Such a 
conference may be in the form of a meeting, a site survey or an inspection. When conducting a 
pre-offer conference, it is recommended that the following guidelines are adhered to: 
  
1.  Agree a time for the conference, allowing sufficient time for all suppliers to plan attendance 
</p>
<p>of the conference.  
 
2.  Inform suppliers in the solicitation documents if participation in the pre-offer conference is 
</p>
<p>mandatory.  
 
3. Written queries from suppliers may be forwarded to the organization prior to the conference 
</p>
<p>responses to the written questions be given orally during the conference.  
 
4.  Send all suppliers within a reasonable time after the conference, whether present at the 
</p>
<p>conference or not, a full set of minutes, recording all queries and formal replies. The minutes 
should prevail over any oral responses provided during the conference.

</p>
<p>5.  If the clarifications given in the meeting alter the requirements, consider the offer closure 
time.  
</p>
<p> 
 
Amendments to solicitation documents 
 
At any time before the deadline for submission of offers, the organization may, for any reason, 
whether on its own initiative or following a request for clarification by a supplier, modify the 
solicitation document. An example of a modification would be the extension of the closing date. 
 
Amendments to solicitation documents should be made in good time before the deadline for 
submission of offers in order for suppliers to address changes in their offers. In certain cases 
amendments will justify an extension of the submission deadline. This should be assessed on a 
case by case basis. 
 
Amendments of solicitation documents containing changes, or giving clarifications, or additional 
information, should be made available simultaneously in writing to all invited suppliers, to 
provide all suppliers with the same fact base. By providing one or more suppliers with additional 
information unavailable to other suppliers during the procurement process, they may gain an 
unfair advantage. This is not in line with the principle of fairness and must therefore be avoided 
at all cost. 
 
Substantial changes to the requirements may call for re-tendering, especially in cases where the 
change could potentially mean that your short list is no longer appropriate.  Amendments to 
solicitation documents should be subject to the same approval by the appropriate authorities as 
the solicitation document itself.

<p>3.6 Receipt and Opening of Offers  
 
Introduction 
 
After the solicitation process, offers are received, registered, handled, opened and stored by 
authorized staff members.  
 
The purpose of this formal process is to ensure that offers are received, handled and opened 
according to the instructions provided in the solicitation documents and that transparency and 
confidentiality is maintained as specified in the relevant regulations, rules and procedures of the 
organization.  
 
This process is usually handled by an independent authority within the organization normally not 
directly involved in the procurement function (e.g. the unit responsible for quality assurance).  
 
There may be differences in the way quotations, bids and proposals are handled. Some of the  
differences are highlighted in this Unit. 
 
 
Process 
 
The flowchart below shows each of the stages in the receipt and opening of offers process. 
 
 
</p>
<p> 
 
Receipt of offers 
 
Receipt of offers is normally performed by an individual not directly involved in the 
procurement function. In some organizations it is the same authority that is in charge of opening 
the offers. For quotations, it is usually the procurement officer in charge who receives them. As 
specified in the solicitation documents, offers should be received: 
 
 at the correct place, date and time 
 in writing 
 via mail, courier service, hand delivery, fax or e-mail.

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-55 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>For offers received by fax or e-mail, &nbsp;this &nbsp;must &nbsp;be &nbsp;on &nbsp;a &nbsp;&lsquo;secure&rsquo; &nbsp;fax &nbsp;machine &nbsp;or &nbsp;e-mail address 
dedicated for the purpose of receipt of offers. The fax machine must be safely secured, i.e. 
locked or in a lockable room. The e-mail address must be safely secured, i.e. password protected. 
Both, &nbsp;the &nbsp;&lsquo;secure&rsquo; &nbsp;fax &nbsp;and &nbsp;e-mail address should only be accessible by the person responsible for 
the receipt of offers.  The offers should be sealed, except in case of quotations. 
 
 
Registration of offers 
 
Upon receipt, the responsible person should properly record the date and time of delivery and 
issue a receipt to the supplier.  The offers received should be recorded against the short list, who 
received the solicitation documents, provided by the procurement officer. 
 
 
Storage of offers 
 
Offers received by fax or e-mail should be sealed in individual envelopes and kept in a secured 
place with the other sealed offers. The secured place should be accessible only by personnel duly 
authorized by the relevant authority until the date and time specified for opening. Some e-
procurement systems may not require paper storage. 
 
 
Opening of offers 
 
The type of solicitation and the solicitation documents used will determine whether the opening 
of the submissions will be conducted in public and which type of information will be disclosed. 
For example: 
 
 Quotations are normally opened internally.  
 Bids are normally opened in a public bid opening. 
 Proposals are usually submitted using a two envelope system, i.e. one envelope for the 
</p>
<p>technical proposal and another separate envelope for the financial proposal. Financial 
proposals will only be opened after technical evaluation has been completed. Therefore, a 
public opening of financial proposals received is not conducted at the point of receipt of 
proposals. In some cases a second opening takes place at a later stage in order to open the 
financial proposals publicly.  
</p>
<p> 
For public opening of offers it is recommended that only those suppliers who have submitted 
offers or their authorized representatives (e.g. their local agent, the concerned embassy, etc.) 
should attend the opening.  Attendance of supplier representatives participating in the public 
opening is normally recorded with the following information, using short list of potential 
suppliers as a reference: 
 
 name of the prospective supplier/local agent/embassy 
 name, signature and title of the representative 
 date of opening of offers. 
 
During the public opening there should be no immediate rejection of any bid, except for late 
offers where the procedures prescribe so.

</p>
<p>Formal process 
Offer opening is a formal process of opening, reading and recording in writing all offers received 
in response to the solicitation, at the date, time and place stipulated in the solicitation documents. 
It is recommended that the offer opening takes place immediately after the deadline for receipt of 
offers. Apart from being efficient, it will reduce any risk of manipulating offers received or 
accepting late bids.  
 
The offer opening process is normally conducted by an authorized opening official/panel. There 
should be a minimum of two people present at the opening, i.e. the designated official plus one 
designated witness. In some organizations the opening official/panel is independent from the 
procurement function / officer handling the solicitation. In some organizations the procurement 
officer participates in the opening of offers. 
 
Offer envelopes are opened one by one, and the opening official/panel should check that the 
offers meet the procedural requirements of the solicitation documents, for example, that there is 
one original offer, the right number of copies, that there is an offer form properly signed by the 
supplier and that the offer is submitted with an offer security, where requested. It is good 
practice to open the offers in the order listed in the short list of potential suppliers of the 
solicitation document. With a two envelope system, technical proposals should be checked to 
ensure that no price information is included. 
 
During the offer opening the following information is usually read out loud: 
 
 supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;name &nbsp;and &nbsp;place &nbsp;of &nbsp;business 
 price and discounts, including currency of the offer (same for alternative offers) 
 delivery time 
 delivery terms 
 offer validity. 
 
Good practice 
It is good practice that: 
 
 Information on other competitors is not provided outside and prior to the bid opening. 
 Discussions on a bid or an award are not entered into at the time of opening. 
 All information related to the opening, records of attendees, records of all offers, including 
</p>
<p>returned offers, should be recorded in an opening record/report, and read aloud to the 
attendees. 
</p>
<p> The opening official/panel and appropriate witnesses should certify the opening process by 
signing the opening record/report. 
</p>
<p>  The opening official/panel closes the opening of the offers. 
 The report must be kept on file.  
 
In some organizations a tabulation/abstract of the offers is used to record prices, as well as 
delivery terms, etc. in order to facilitate the evaluation process. This tabulation/abstract is done 
as soon as possible after the opening of the offers or as part of the opening record/report. 
The offers after they have been opened, dated and signed by the opening official/panel, together 
with the opening record/report and a tabulation/abstract of the offers, if applicable, are delivered 
to the procurement officer in charge of the evaluation.

</p>
<p>Opening record/report 
 
The opening official/panel is in charge of filing an opening record/report, which provides a 
record of the offer opening process and normally contains the following information: 
 
 offer submission deadline (date, time and extensions, if any) 
 offers received: name and country of origin of the supplier 
 type of submission (mail, fax, telephone, etc.) 
 date and time of the beginning and end of the opening of offers  
 price and currency of the offers, and price of alternative offers, if applicable 
 offer securities, if requested 
 discounts, if any proposed by the suppliers 
 offer validity period (and extensions, if any) 
 names &nbsp;of &nbsp;supplier &nbsp;or &nbsp;suppliers&rsquo; &nbsp;representative present at public opening of offers, where 
</p>
<p>relevant 
 list of offers rejected for various reasons: e.g. late submissions, incompleteness, etc.  
 
 
Handover to procurement function 
 
Once offers have been formally opened, they should be handed to the procurement function for 
proper handing.  Detailed below are some possible situations that may occur once offers have 
been opened with guidelines on how to handle offers in these situations. 
 
Withdrawal of offers 
Offers may be withdrawn in writing prior to the closing date of the solicitation.  
After the closing date, the UN organizations should not honour withdrawal of offers. In certain 
cases the UN organizations may be entitled to collect the offer bond, which guarantees the 
validity of the offer submitted by the supplier. 
 
Alteration to offers 
Offers may be modified in writing prior to the solicitation closing date. The latest offer is the 
binding one. After the closing date, suppliers should not be requested or permitted to alter their 
offers. In certain cases the UN organizations may be entitled to collect the offer bond, which 
guarantees the validity of the offer submitted by the supplier. 
 
Multiple offers/alternative offers 
Some organizations allow multiple offers. Where suppliers have submitted more than one offer, 
the offer that provides the most advantageous terms to the organization should be considered. 
Where alternative offers are welcome according to the solicitation document, they should be 
treated like any other offer received.  
 
Unsolicited offers 
Unsolicited offers should be dealt with according to the rules of the organization. In some 
organizations they are normally rejected, unless specific circumstances established by the rules 
of each organization, allow for their acceptance, for example where the unsolicited offer was 
submitted by a supplier who is representing a supplier who was originally invited. Care should 
be taken to identify how the company obtained information relating to a solicitation. It is 
important to ascertain that the company is a bona fide supplier and meets all the prerequisites </p>

</p>
<p>such as registration, financial viability, capacities, quality, delivery etc. Full records of the 
verification should be kept in the supplier's profile. 
 
Inadvertently opened offers 
Any offers inadvertently opened prior to the due time must be brought to the attention of the 
appropriate authority for further action, i.e. the opening official/panel. The fact that this 
happened should be recorded in the opening record/report. 
 
Offers received at wrong destination 
The procurement officer or any other officer who may receive an offer in error must make all 
efforts to deliver it immediately to the opening official/panel unopened and by hand. In cases 
where an offer is received on a fax / e-mail address other than the secured fax / e-mail, the 
opening official/panel should immediately be informed, and the offer should usually be rejected 
as confidentiality and transparency can no longer be guaranteed. 
 
Late offers 
Offers received after the closing date should not be accepted, except, perhaps where there is 
reasonable evidence that late delivery of an offer was caused by factors beyond the control of the 
supplier. In those cases, and only if received before the official opening took place, these offers 
may be considered, &nbsp;depending &nbsp;on &nbsp;each &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;internal &nbsp;procedures.

<p>3.7 Evaluation 
 
Introduction 
 
The evaluation process consists of the preliminary examination and evaluation of the offers 
received, and considered to be valid, to assess their responsiveness to specifications and 
requirements as defined in the solicitation document, analyse their cost and benefit, and 
determine their price and value. Evaluation, together with the requirement definition and the 
evaluation criteria and method specified in the solicitation document, is the basis for the 
subsequent selection of the offer that provides the best value for money for the organization.  
 
Best value for money in the context of evaluation of offers, means that price alone is not always 
the only criterion factored into an evaluation method. Other criteria such as quality, availability, 
time, compliance, cost for maintenance and support, life cycle cost, etc. are part of the equation 
to determine the best return on investment of the procurement of goods, services or works. 
 
Evaluation is conducted by a designated evaluation team and in accordance with the relevant 
regulations, rules and procedures, using the evaluation criteria and method pre-determined in the 
solicitation document in order to conduct a fair and unbiased evaluation. The evaluation process 
also needs to be transparent, and therefore each step of the process documented in an evaluation 
report which subsequently is the basis for the recommendation of award.  
 
 
Evaluation pre-requisites 
 
The pre-requisite tasks for evaluation include: 
  
 establishing an evaluation team 
 developing a plan 
 using the pre-established criteria and methods 
 ensuring transparency. 
 
Establishing the evaluation team 
Evaluation is usually overseen and coordinated by the procurement officer who usually conducts 
the evaluation together with an evaluation team. The task of the evaluation team is to ensure that 
the suppliers and their offers satisfy the requirements of the solicitation documents, and to 
evaluate the offers according to the predefined evaluation criteria.  
 
The team usually consists of two to five members, depending on the nature, complexity and 
value of the procurement activity. The evaluation team may include other procurement officers 
and/or technical experts. Technical experts may be external suppliers hired for this particular 
purpose. It is good practice that requisitioners or end-users should only be allowed in the 
evaluation team as observers, and only in exceptional cases. However, there may be cases where 
the requisitioners need to be involved in the evaluation, i.e. to ensure technical compliance of the 
offer with the requirement definition for example during an RFP. In such cases it is 
recommended that requisitioners are only involved in the technical and not the commercial 
evaluation process. Where requisitioners participate in an evaluation team, it should be ensured 
that they do not have the majority vote in the team.

</p>
<p>It is recommended that everybody involved in the evaluation process signs a declaration of 
confidentiality, impartiality, and no conflict of interest regarding each particular evaluation.  
 
Good practice 
It is also good practice that members of the evaluation team are briefed by the procurement 
officer about their role during the evaluation process, for example, members of the evaluation 
team should: 
 
 Indicate immediately if in a potential conflict of interest situation with one of the suppliers and 
</p>
<p>ask to be replaced. 
 Study the requirement definition, the evaluation criteria and method. 
 Understand that the deliberations of the evaluation committee are strictly confidential and that 
</p>
<p>they cannot discuss the content of the evaluation with colleagues and/or outsiders. 
 Clarify or direct questions for suppliers in writing to the procurement officer who in turn will 
</p>
<p>communicate with the concerned supplier(s). 
 
Confidentiality 
All staff members involved in evaluating offers should be careful to observe confidentiality of 
the offers and ascertain that information about the content of the submissions or the evaluation 
process is not revealed outside the group involved in the procurement process. 
The procurement officer ensures the confidentiality of the process. In order to do so, it is good 
practice to channel all clarifying questions intended for suppliers through the procurement 
officer.  
 
Developing the evaluation plan 
It is good practice and a useful internal tool to establish an evaluation plan along with the 
preparation of the solicitation documents. It should detail the timeframe and responsibilities of 
the evaluation team members during the evaluation process, the evaluation criteria and the 
evaluation method that will be applied.  
 
Depending on the complexity of the procurement, the evaluation plan may be summarized in a 
few lines, or consist of long and precise descriptions of each stage in  the evaluation process. The 
evaluation plan, like the evaluation criteria and method should not be changed after the 
solicitation document has been issued. 
 
Using the evaluation criteria and method 
Upon the receipt and opening of offers, evaluation must be conducted according to the set of 
evaluation criteria and method, which have been established during the preparation of the 
solicitation documents. Once established in, and issued with the solicitation documents the 
evaluation criteria and method must not be altered unless by amendment of the solicitation 
documents before the closing of the solicitation. This provides the basis for an objective and 
transparent evaluation approach.  
 
Depending on the complexity of the procurement, the evaluation criteria may be summarized in a 
few lines, or consist of long and precise descriptions of the steps of the evaluation necessary to 
ensure best value for money for the organization.

</p>
<p>

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Evaluation criteria can be divided into the following categories: 
 
 formal  
 technical  
 financial.  
 
Formal criteria 
Offers are checked for their compliance with any formal criteria stated in the solicitation 
documents. Offers not meeting the formal criteria are rejected. Examples of formal criteria are: 
 
 offers have been properly signed 
 offers are accompanied by the required securities, if applicable 
 supplier is eligible, e.g. duly registered if pre-registration is a requirement 
 offers are accompanied by the required documentation 
 offers are complete, etc. (solicitation documents must clearly state whether partial bids for a 
</p>
<p>given component or lot are accepted). 
 
Technical criteria 
Technical evaluation criteria are derived from the specifications, TOR or SOW. Depending on 
the nature and complexity of the procurement to be undertaken, technical evaluation criteria may 
be summarized in a few lines or consist of a long and precise description.  
 
Depending on how clearly the requirements are defined, evaluation criteria are developed for 
evaluation according to compliance/non-compliance or a weighted scoring (see evaluation 
methodologies below). When using the weighted scoring methodology, technical evaluation 
criteria are related to the approach and methodology proposed to reach the expected results or 
solve the identified problem as described in the requirement definition (TOR or SOW). 
 
Technical criteria can also include requirements to the supplier, such as: 
 
 previous experience in similar field and with same type of requirements 
 experience from the region 
 available capacity and equipment to undertake the assignment 
 qualification and experience of proposed personnel. 
 
Financial criteria 
Price is an important evaluation criterion but the weight of the price depends on the chosen 
evaluation methodology (see below). It is important to clearly state in the solicitation documents 
which price factors will be included in the price used for evaluation. Various factors such as 
freight cost, operational cost, incidental or start-up costs, as well as life cycle costs could be 
taken into consideration. For services and works a template for breakdown of cost should be 
provided, e.g. in BoQ for works. In all cases, required breakdown as well as evaluation criteria 
must be clearly stated in the solicitation documents. 
 
Ensuring transparency  
To ensure the integrity of the process and to provide a proper audit trail, all stages in the 
evaluation process should be documented in writing to verify that the process has been 
conducted in accordance with the regulatory procurement framework and principles of the </p>

The opening official/panel delivers the opening record/report, together with the (copies of) the 
offers, to the procurement officer responsible for the evaluation of the offers. 
 
 
Receipt or creation of tabulation/abstract of valid offers 
 
A tabulation/abstract provides an overview of all the offers that meet the procedural 
requirements (e.g. sealed offer) of the solicitation document and which, after the opening of the 
offers, were considered valid offers for further evaluation. Where alternative offers are allowed 
according to the solicitation document, they should also be tabulated if considered valid, i.e. 
meeting the procedural requirements.   
 
 
Preliminary examination of offers 
 
The preliminary examination of offers excludes offers from further consideration that do not 
meet the mandatory criteria specified in the solicitation documents. Some examples of 
mandatory requirements are offers: 
 
 have been properly signed 
 are accompanied by the required offer securities 
 are accompanied by the required documentation 
 are complete 
 validity period conform with requirements 
 terms and conditions of the organization are accepted etc.

</p>
<p>This is a pass/fail exercise. Submissions that do not meet the mandatory requirements are not 
acceptable and are rejected and therefore will not be considered further in the evaluation process.  
 
The rejection of offers should be documented in writing and depending on the organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;
procedures; further consideration may be subject to the approval of the relevant section 
chief/procurement chief. 
 
Once offers that are ready to be evaluated have been identified, the procurement officer may 
prepare a listing of those offers that should be evaluated first. For example, where the sole 
evaluation criterion is the lowest price, the evaluation should start at the lowest offer.  
 
 
Evaluation of offers 
 
Offers which have passed the preliminary examination are evaluated based on the evaluation 
criteria and method stipulated in the solicitation document. Usually each evaluation follows the 
steps listed in the table below: 
 
Step Action 
1 Conduct technical / quality evaluation (including evaluation of samples). 
2 Conduct financial / commercial evaluation. 
3 Conduct supplier evaluation. 
4 Clarify offers. 
5 Draft synopsis of evaluation reports and comparative analysis of results. 
6 Determine the most advantageous offer. 
</p>
<p> 
Technical /quality evaluation (including evaluation of samples) 
Technical Evaluation is the process of comparing the offers with the technical and quality 
requirements as specified in the specifications, TOR or SOW of the solicitation document. 
 
In addition, quality may be evaluated by obtaining samples of the product or by conducting an 
inspection at the manufacturing facility. The sample evaluation or inspection is undertaken 
against the specifications as stated in the solicitation document. 
 
Usually the technical evaluation is done independently from and prior to the evaluation of prices 
to keep the evaluation process objective. 
 
It is good practice to summarize the results of the technical / quality evaluation in a 
technical/quality evaluation report. The responsible evaluation team should sign the report and 
forward it to the procurement officer/evaluation team responsible for the financial/commercial 
and supplier evaluation.  
 
Financial /commercial evaluation 
Financial evaluation of the proposals involves comparing the offers with the financial and 
commercial requirements stipulated in the solicitation document. During this step prices should 
be reviewed against prevailing market conditions, and whether they are reasonable in view of the 
requirements. It is also important to identify whether they are within the available budget for the 
project.

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>It is good practice to summarize the results of the financial/commercial evaluation in a 
financial/commercial evaluation report. The responsible evaluation team should sign the report.  
 
Supplier evaluation 
Before making a recommendation of award, the procurement officer should make sure that the 
supplier whose offer has been evaluated as the most advantageous one is also qualified to 
effectively carry out the contract. It is good practice to consider past performance and to check 
their financial soundness and the currently available resources to perform under the contract. 
 
If pre-qualification &nbsp;has &nbsp;not &nbsp;preceded &nbsp;the &nbsp;solicitation &nbsp;process, &nbsp;the &nbsp;selected &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;qualification &nbsp;
should be checked prior to contract award. This is usually called post-qualification. The post-
qualification process should be performed based on the qualification criteria set out in the 
solicitation documents. Such qualification criteria may be, for example, all or some of the 
following: 
 
 financial strength 
 performance record 
 integrity and business ethics record 
 experience and technical capacity 
 production capacity. 
 
A potential supplier who does not meet the required qualifications will be rejected. However, 
rejection of suppliers based on supplier qualification should be exceptional at this stage, as this 
would limit the value of the short listing process. Short lists should be composed of companies 
that can reasonably be expected to meet the criteria. Justification for rejection should be recorded 
on file. If rejected, the procurement officer should consider the supplier with the next most 
advantageous offer. 
 
If a pre-qualification procedure has preceded the solicitation, only suppliers considered qualified 
would be allowed to submit offers. At this stage, before making an award recommendation, it is 
necessary only to check whether any condition on the part of the supplier has changed since the 
pre-qualification took place (financial difficulties, company structure changed, etc).  
 
In some UN organizations, the contract award is subject to the condition that the selected 
supplier successfully completes the supplier registration process as this also constitutes a form of 
qualification in those organizations (see Unit 3.3 Sourcing). 
 
Clarification of offers 
Taking into account the principle of equality and fair treatment of prospective suppliers, 
discussions with potential suppliers may take place in complex cases, where clarifications from 
the suppliers may be required in order to finalize the evaluation. The key condition when seeking 
clarifications of offers from suppliers is that neither the substance nor the price of the offers 
should be allowed to be changed. All discussions should be in writing and properly documented 
in the respective file. No information obtained from one supplier should be shared with the other 
competitors.  
 
For discussions with suppliers over the phone or in person it is good practice to have a witness 
present from the evaluation team. Discussions should preferably be conducted at UN premises. 
During the discussion, suppliers are usually asked to make a presentation about their offer and, in </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-65 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>order to ensure fairness, the same questions should be asked of all suppliers. All discussions with 
suppliers during these visits should be recorded in writing and properly documented. 
 
For high value or strategic procurement, a site visit of the supplier's premises may be necessary 
prior to finalising the evaluation. In these cases, the solicitation documents should inform 
suppliers that a site visit may be conducted during the evaluation process. All discussions with 
suppliers during these visits should be recorded in writing and properly documented. The 
procurement officer should ensure that all technically qualified suppliers are given an equal 
opportunity to be visited. 
 
Synopsis of evaluation reports and comparative analysis of results / determination of the 
most advantageous offer 
After the individual evaluations have taken place, the procurement officer/evaluation team has to 
determine which of the offers meets all requirements of the specifications / TOR / SOW and 
offers the best price or the best value for money. There are various evaluation methods for 
obtaining such results. The evaluation method to be followed is the one that has been stipulated 
in the solicitation document. The different evaluation methods are further discussed below. As a 
result, all acceptable offers can be ranked and a decision made as to which is the most 
advantageous / responsive / acceptable one. 
 
 
Evaluation report 
 
The last step in the evaluation process is the preparation of an evaluation report, which will later 
be used as the basis for the recommendation of award. An evaluation report typically contains an 
executive summary of the evaluation process and its individual steps as outlined above. Any 
invalidation, rejection, non-compliance, and clarification of offers should be stated, including a 
list with the final ranking of the offers and the reasoning on how the best offer was selected. It is 
good practice to have the evaluation team sign the evaluation report. In addition, the evaluation 
report should include a standard declaration of non conflict of interest of the members of the 
evaluation team. 
 
 
Negotiations (if applicable) 
 
Negotiations (if applicable) are an interactive process of discussions between the buyer and the 
supplier regarding the terms and conditions of a contract. In principle, negotiations are usually 
not undertaken after a competitive selection process. In some organizations and in exceptional 
circumstances negotiations may be permitted with the supplier of the offer that has been 
identified, as the result of an evaluation, as the preferred offer. In some organizations it also 
depends on the type of solicitation as to whether negotiations are allowed or not. For example, 
some organizations do not allow negotiations when the solicitation method is an ITB. While 
most organizations agree that negotiations are allowed for RFP and where competition has been 
waived. In any case, negotiations should only take place after the evaluation has been 
successfully completed and a supplier has been selected. Negotiations are to be with the selected 
supplier only. 
 
It is good practice to provide proper written justification for any negotiations. When negotiations 
take place it should be ensured that the requirements (specifications, TOR, SOW) and quantities </p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006

Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-66 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>are not changed substantially as this would require cancellation of the tender process and 
initiation of a new one. 
 
Negotiations during an invitation to bid (ITB) 
In principle negotiations during an ITB are not allowed.  They may, however, be allowed with 
the lowest priced compliant supplier after the selection process has been completed, but only in 
very exceptional cases such as: 
 
 Marginal budget constraints, where the available budget is not sufficient to purchase the 
</p>
<p>requested item(s) and the supplier agrees to reduce the price. 
 The offer contains additional equipment or services which were not required in the solicitation 
</p>
<p>document. 
 Marginally higher quantity required compared to original quantity in the solicitation document 
</p>
<p>leading to a potential quantity discounts. 
 
Negotiations during a request for proposal (RFP) 
Negotiations during an RFP are in principle allowed, if provided for in the solicitation document 
and selection of the preferred supplier has been completed. 
 
Best and final offer (BAFO) 
A method of competitive negotiations with a short list of selected suppliers during an RFP is the 
so called best and final offer (BAFO).  The BAFO is an optional step in the selection of offers 
with the objective of enhancing competition, and thus ensuring best value for money.  
 
Upon completion of the overall evaluation, the procurement officer/evaluation team may decide 
to engage in competitive negotiations with all suppliers passing the threshold of the technical 
evaluation.   
 
Under the BAFO concept, the purpose of these discussions and negotiations is to clarify 
ambiguities, correct obvious mistakes, point out weaknesses and deficiencies, and generally seek 
improvements in both the technical and financial aspects of the offers, for example regarding 
lower prices, prolonged warranties, additional discounts, or shorter delivery time, etc.  
 
All suppliers chosen to submit a BAFO should be provided with information about the 
deficiencies in their proposal, and be asked in writing to submit a decisive and final offer as a 
follow up to their proposal by a certain deadline. The suppliers should be informed that price 
increases will not be accepted, however, they may decline to alter the terms of their original 
proposal, and that such decision will not render them unacceptable. 
 
The request to submit a BAFO should not contain any information regarding the evaluation, or 
any information on the chances for contract award. 
 
Upon receipt of the BAFOs from the suppliers, the evaluation committee should reconvene and 
include the new proposals in the technical and financial evaluation, as necessary, and should 
make a final comparison of the competing offers.  
 
Negotiations in situations where competition has been waived 
Negotiations can prove very effective in situations where competition has been waived ensuring 
competitive prices, terms and conditions.

</p>
<p>Evaluation methods 
 
UN organizations usually use one or a combination of the following evaluation methods: 
 
 Lowest responsive/compliant/acceptable offer 
 Weighted scoring system. 
 
Lowest responsive/compliant/acceptable offer is typically used for RFQs and ITBs, while 
weighted scoring system is used for RFPs. However, this is changing and weighted scoring 
system can also be used for ITBs and RFQs. In some cases a combination of the two are used. 
 
Lowest responsive/compliant/acceptable offer 
When using this method, the award of a contract should be made to the supplier whose offer has 
been evaluated and determined as both: 
 
a) responsive/compliant/acceptable, and 
b) offering the lowest price/cost. 
 
 &ldquo;Responsive/compliant/acceptable&rdquo; &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;defined &nbsp;as &nbsp;fully &nbsp;meeting &nbsp;the &nbsp;specifications/TOR/ &nbsp;
SOW required, or reaching a pre-defined threshold of a maximum attainable score based on the 
requirements stated in the specifications /TOR/SOW. 
 
The level of responsiveness/compliance/acceptability may be measured using straightforward 
pass/fail criteria or more complex approaches like a weighted scoring system. 
 
There is a difference between price and cost. While price is the amount of money you pay to 
procure a certain product or service, cost is the amount of money you pay to operate the 
equipment over its lifetime or for the duration of a contract or project taking all price and related 
cost &nbsp;factors &nbsp;into &nbsp;account. &nbsp;The &nbsp;latter &nbsp;is &nbsp;also &nbsp;called &nbsp;the &nbsp;&ldquo;total &nbsp;cost &nbsp;of &nbsp;ownership &nbsp;(life &nbsp;cycle &nbsp;
costing)&rdquo;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 
When applying the concept of lowest cost, cost means price plus other related cost factors such 
as freight cost, operational &nbsp;cost, &nbsp;cost &nbsp;of &nbsp;disposal, &nbsp;etc. &nbsp;Concepts &nbsp;like &nbsp;&ldquo;landed &nbsp;cost&rdquo; &nbsp;or &nbsp;&ldquo;lowest &nbsp;total &nbsp;
cost &nbsp;of &nbsp;ownership &nbsp;(life &nbsp;cycle &nbsp;costing)&rdquo; &nbsp;fall &nbsp;under &nbsp;this &nbsp;category. 
 
Landed cost 
The calculation of hidden landed costs requires acknowledgement of the expenses necessary to 
purchase goods from one country and import them into another. Determining the total landed 
cost of an item involves three main elements: the actual cost of the goods, transportation and 
insurance costs, and all duties, taxes and governmental fees assessed on the goods.  
 
Lowest total cost of ownership/life cycle costing 
&ldquo;Lowest &nbsp;total &nbsp;cost &nbsp;of &nbsp;ownership&rdquo; &nbsp;considers &nbsp;several &nbsp;components &nbsp;of &nbsp;price &nbsp;quantified &nbsp;and &nbsp;tabulated &nbsp;
over the life expectancy of the supply such as purchase price, operational costs, cost of disposal 
and other considerations. 
 
The &nbsp;&ldquo;lowest &nbsp;responsive/compliant/acceptable &nbsp;offer&rdquo; &nbsp;is &nbsp;the &nbsp;simplest &nbsp;method &nbsp;of &nbsp;evaluating &nbsp;offers &nbsp;
whereby non responsive/compliant/acceptable offers are rejected as soon as this becomes 
apparent. Among the remaining responsive/compliant/acceptable offers the lowest one is 
selected. </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-68 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>This method may be used for procurement where: 
 
 specifications/TOR/SOW are clear 
 responsiveness/compliance/acceptability is easy to determine 
 price/cost is the overriding evaluation criterion compared to other aspects of value for money. 
 
Some examples are, standard goods such as e.g. cars, office equipment, communication 
equipment, chemicals, simple machinery or raw materials or for the procurement of services and 
works when the requirements can be quantitatively and qualitatively defined. 
 
The lowest responsive/compliant/acceptable offer methodology consists of the following steps: 
 
Step Action 
1  Determining which offers are responsive/compliant/acceptable, and reject non 
</p>
<p>responsive/compliant/acceptable offers.  
 Only bids offering goods/works/services meeting or exceeding the 
</p>
<p>requirements in the specifications should be considered 
responsive/compliant/acceptable. 
</p>
<p>2  Choosing the lowest cost offer among the responsive/compliant/acceptable 
offers. 
</p>
<p> 
Normally, a one-envelope system where suppliers submit one offer including all technical and 
financial information is used when applying this method of evaluation. However, a two-envelope 
method where technical and financial offers are sealed separately may also be used if it is 
deemed necessary to complete the technical evaluation without knowing the price of the 
respective offers, typically when responsiveness / compliance / acceptance is determined by a 
minimum threshold (point system). 
 
Weighted scoring method 
When using the weighted scoring method, the award of a contract should be made to the supplier 
whose offer has been evaluated and determined as: 
 
a)  responsive / compliant / acceptable, and 
b)  having received the highest score out of a pre-determined set of weighted technical and 
</p>
<p>financial criteria specific to the solicitation. 
 
This method may be used for more complex procurement where: 
 
 evaluation criteria cannot easily be quantified 
 different aspects of value for money (e.g. price and quality) need to be considered and balanced 
 different types of scales need to be used for the various factors. 
 
The weighted scoring method is typically used for procurement of services, where the relative 
importance of each evaluation criterion needs to be weighted. It can also be used for the 
evaluation of offers for complex goods and works requiring the evaluation to be based on a 
number of criteria other than price in order to ensure best value for money, and where it is 
difficult to evaluate an offer on the compliant/non-compliant scale, only.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-69 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Under this evaluation method, price is rendered as one of the evaluation criteria. In general, the 
more complex the requirement, the more significant the end product, and the less comparable the 
proposals, the less influence price should have on the selection, and the points allocated to the 
financial offer would be lower. For more straightforward requirements, price can play a 
significant part in the selection process, provided that the other criteria are also met. The total 
number of points allocated for the technical offer is normally higher than the total number of 
points allocated to the financial offer. This way the risk of selecting a non-performing supplier is 
reduced, and the saving achieved by selecting the lower priced offer is not outweighed by the 
implications caused by a non-performing supplier. Thus, the financial offer is typically given 
between 15 and 50 percent importance.   
 
Financial offer 
The financial offer should be opened only for those proposals where the technical evaluation 
scores above a stated threshold, usually above 60 percent of the points allocated to the technical 
offer. For those proposals where the technical offer does not reach the minimum specified score, 
the corresponding financial offer is not eligible for further consideration, and the financial offer 
should be returned to the supplier unopened, accompanied by a letter notifying the supplier. 
 
The maximum number of points allocated to the financial offer is given to the lowest priced 
proposal. All other financial offers receive points in inverse proportion, e.g. according to the 
following formula: 
 
p &nbsp;= &nbsp;y &nbsp;∙ &nbsp;&micro;/z 
 
where: 
 
p = points for the financial offer being evaluated 
y = maximum number of points for the financial offer 
&micro; = price of the lowest priced proposal  
z = price of the proposal being evaluated  
 
The proposal obtaining the overall highest score after adding the score of the technical offer and 
the financial offer is the proposal that offers best value for money. 
 
Some disadvantages of weighted scoring methods are:  
 
 Time consuming &mdash; decision factors and evaluation scales must be developed, and each 
</p>
<p>alternative must be compared against each evaluation scale.  
 Decision factors may be linked, which may result in double counting. 
 Quasi objectivity due to many subjective decisions (i.e. scoring, weighting factors, etc.), 
</p>
<p>especially where criteria cannot easily be quantified. 
 
Price/cost analysis 
The evaluation methods described above show techniques for attaining competitive and best 
value procurement. When there is no competition, the procurement officer must still ensure that 
the price the organization is paying is fair and reasonable. This can be done by performing a 
price/cost analysis. There are a few methods that can be used to determine that the price being 
paid and the conditions of the offer are fair and reasonable. They are, for example: 
 
 market price, e.g. via consulting market publications </p>

<p>3.8 Contract Review and Award 
 
Introduction 
 
Contract review is an essential step in the contracting process. It provides for independent 
written advice on the acceptability of the procurement process undertaken, and the proposed 
commitment of funds by the highest level procurement authority or officer with the appropriate 
delegated authority, through contracts or purchase orders (awarding authority). 
 
Award is the formal decision and approval to establish a contract, e.g. services contract or 
purchase order, or an LTA, with a successful supplier, based on independent review of the 
procurement process within the limits of awarding authority.  The award phase marks the: 
 
 successful conclusion of the procurement process 
 starting point for contract finalization and execution. 
 
Purpose 
The purpose of conducting a review prior to recommending awards is to: 
 
 Provide an independent and unbiased review of recommendations for contracts or purchase 
</p>
<p>orders. 
 Ensure that the procurement process was fairly conducted and followed the appropriate 
</p>
<p>policies and procedures. 
 Confirm the necessary budget for the contractual commitment is available. 
 Confirm that the recommendation for award and terms of contract represent best value for 
</p>
<p>money and that it is in the interests of the UN to select the chosen supplier. 
 Seek approval from the appropriate authority to contractually commit the UN to procure the 
</p>
<p>goods, services or works. 
 
Requirement 
Thorough preparation of contract recommendation and approval documents is necessary to 
facilitate the award process; the explanations provided should be transparent, clear and precise 
justifications of the process leading to the award recommendation. Transparency and due 
diligence are key at this stage. Deliberate omission of relevant information is as unethical as 
deliberately submitting wrong information; short submission documents to cut corners are 
neither efficient in the long-term nor in line with the UN procurement principles. To avoid 
delays and omissions, standardized templates and check lists should be used for quality control.  
When delays arise they are usually a symptom of poorly executed planning or the result of 
attempted short cuts to speed up the process. 
 
Responsibility 
Usually the highest ranking official in a UN organization is the executive source of all 
procurement authority, and as such provides approval of contract awards, and purchases. 
Through organization specific FRR this official re-delegates that authority to senior-level 
officials. Those officials may appoint individuals within their organizations as procurement 
officers with limited awarding authorities to approve awards. Only these procurement officers 
and other designated UN staff have authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the respective </p>

<p>UN organization. Therefore, only those staff members can actually make a purchase. Normally 
the extent of the delegation of authority is based on the level of the procurement officer. 
 
UN organizations have established different levels of delegation of authority to implement their 
procurement activities with regards to the responsibility of the procurement, review, 
recommendation and award process. Delegations are usually set using financial thresholds.  
Recommendations for and approval of award above a pre-defined threshold are subject to 
independent review by a contracts committee and approval by the highest procurement authority 
within an organization. This results in the following two process scenarios: 
 
 Review and award below threshold, i.e. no review by the contracts committee required 
 Review and award above threshold for review by the contracts committee. 
 
 
Process 
 
The &nbsp;flowcharts &nbsp;below &nbsp;show &nbsp;each &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;stages &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;&lsquo;below&rsquo; &nbsp;and &nbsp;&lsquo;above&rsquo; &nbsp;threshold &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;

</p>
<p> 
 
Preparation of award recommendation document 
 
The &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;officer&rsquo;s &nbsp;main &nbsp;responsibility &nbsp;in &nbsp;this &nbsp;phase &nbsp;is &nbsp;to &nbsp;prepare &nbsp;an &nbsp;award &nbsp;
recommendation document, based on an evaluation report, for submission to the appropriate 
person or committee for review and subsequent approval in accordance with established 
organization procedures and delegation of authority. 
 
The procurement officer makes sure that the award recommendation documents are written in a 
clear, precise and honest manner and reflect all necessary information that lead to the 
recommendation of award. Proper procurement processes should be followed, for example: 
 
 Minimum number of valid offers have been obtained, and if not, reasons are recorded as part of 
</p>
<p>the award recommendation to confirm why this is considered acceptable under the 
circumstances.

</p>
<p> If there is no tendering, the lowest acceptable offer has been rejected, or there are other 
exceptions, the reasons must be recorded and explained as part of the award recommendation 
quoting the relevant financial rule. 
</p>
<p> A supplier evaluation recommendation has been received, or due diligence has been completed 
ensuring that the supplier is acceptable and able to fulfil the purchase order or contract. 
</p>
<p> The procurement process and evaluation have been carried out in a fair and proper manner. 
 The procurement is in accordance with the relevant FRR. 
 Other information considered important for the review has been factored in. 
 There is a summary of recommendation for award. 
 
 
Below threshold: submission of recommendation to awarding authority 
 
For the remaining stages in the below threshold process, the award recommendation document is 
usually submitted to the officer with the appropriate awarding authority for review and approval 
of award. Before a commitment is entered into the awarding authority then reviews the 
submission in terms of: 
 
 compliance with procurement regulations, rules, and procedures  
 availability of funds  
 compliance with proper documentation processes. 
 
The awarding authority then rejects or accepts the award recommendation. Acceptance 
constitutes the approval of award. 
 
 
Above threshold: submission of request for award to contracts committee 
 
For the process above the threshold, a contracts committee independently reviews the 
procurement process to ensure that regulations, rules and procedures were followed and funds 
are available for the subsequent approval. 
 
 
Above threshold: review by contracts committee 
 
The contracts committee should be independent from the officials involved in the procurement 
process to avoid conflict of interest when reviewing and recommending the award.  A contracts 
committee is usually composed of the following voting members: 
 
 chairman 
 at least two senior staff members. 
 
In addition and where required, other staff members (e.g. representative of the legal department, 
project managers, chief of procurement, etc.) are called to participate in the meeting as advisors.  
It is good practice that procurement officers are non-voting members of a contracts committee in 
order to preserve the impartiality of the review and decision making process and to avoid conflict 
of interest.

</p>
<p>The contracts committee should meet on a regular basis and follow established procedures for 
review, recommendation, and recording of minutes &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;committee&rsquo;s &nbsp;meetings. &nbsp; &nbsp;It &nbsp;is &nbsp;the &nbsp;

 the interests of the UN organization are protected 
 the procurement activities are carried out in conformity with FRR, instructions and directives 
</p>
<p>and are in accordance with best business practices. 
 
Some contracts committees may invite the procurement officers into the meeting of the 
committee to present their submission and to clarify questions. 
 
After the completion of the meeting, minutes are prepared by the contracts committee secretary.  
 
The minutes should record the deliberations of the committee and the recommendations in a 
brief but fully explanatory manner. All members, or their alternates, present at the meeting will 
accept / approve the minutes and this will serve as recommendation to the awarding authority 
that a contract should or should not be entered into. 
 
Recommendation of award to awarding authority 
 
Minutes should be submitted to the awarding authority in the organization who should review 
the contracts committee recommendations.  
 
Rejection/approval of award by awarding authority 
 
The awarding authority can reject or approve the recommendations. Where the awarding 
authority decides not to accept the advice of the contracts committee, the reasons should be 
recorded in writing and forwarded to the chairperson of the contracts committee. 
 
No-objection from clients 
In some organizations, and without impairing the segregation of duties principle, the results of 
the &nbsp;award &nbsp;are &nbsp;forwarded &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;client. &nbsp;Only &nbsp;once &nbsp;the &nbsp;client &nbsp;has &nbsp;confirmed &nbsp;its &nbsp;&ldquo;no &nbsp;objection&rdquo; &nbsp;to &nbsp;
the result of the procurement process, contracts can be entered into with the supplier who 
received the award. The purpose of this no objection is to ensure that the procured products and 
services do indeed meet the requirements of the client.  
 
In &nbsp;some &nbsp;organizations &nbsp;&ldquo;no-objection&rdquo; &nbsp;is &nbsp;required &nbsp;before &nbsp;the &nbsp;award.

<p>3.9 Contract Finalization and Issuance 
 
Introduction 
 
Contract finalization is the process followed by the procurement officer to form a written 
contract with a supplier. The purpose of contract finalization is to ensure that all proper elements 
are in place to conclude a written agreement that protects the interests of the UN organization 
and reflects the offer made by the supplier in response to the requirement presented by the UN 
organization. 
 
A &nbsp;contract &nbsp;is &nbsp;formed &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;basis &nbsp;of &nbsp;an &nbsp;&ldquo;offer&rdquo; &nbsp;and &nbsp;an &nbsp;&ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; &nbsp;and &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;context &nbsp;of &nbsp;
procurement in the UN system of organizations, is a written document, containing the 
agreement, and the terms and conditions, between the UN organization and the supplier, and 
which serves as proof of the obligation. Contractual instruments common among UN 
organizations are POs, contracts for services and works, LTAs, system contracts, blanket 
purchase orders, lease agreements, etc. for goods, services and works.  
 
In the UN system of organizations contracts are based on competitive solicitation processes. 
However, under certain circumstances (e.g. direct contract, sole source or complex contracts), in 
order to proceed to form a contract with the selected supplier, the procurement officer may need 
to clarify and negotiate terms and conditions.  
 
Proper procedures should be followed to ensure that no negotiations take place with respect to 
issues already agreed at the solicitation stage and that the parties are clear about their respective 
rights and responsibilities. In certain cases, negotiations may be carried out with the selected 
supplier regarding payment terms, supplementary terms and conditions, delivery, etc. 
Negotiations nonetheless should result in a clear understanding of responsibilities under the 
contract. In this context, negotiation is the process of arriving at an agreement on the terms and 
conditions of a contractual agreement through discussions between the UN organization and the 
supplier.

</p>
<p>Contract negotiation 
 
In a competitive solicitation process it is good practice to select the appropriate contractual 
instrument at the time of the preparation of the solicitation documents and to include a sample 
copy of a contract as an annex to the solicitation documents. This will ensure any issues the 
supplier may have with the special and general terms and conditions of the contract are 
addressed in their response to the solicitation documents and are taken into account during the 
evaluation of proposals. In these cases, in general, very limited negotiations should need to take 
place after the evaluation / award and prior to the signature of the contract. 
  
Where required, negotiations have the potential to improve the procurement outcome by 
reducing uncertainties, risks and costs. However, as a general rule, at this stage of the process 
negotiations with the supplier should not go over issues agreed to during the solicitation process. 
The procurement officer must also ensure that no appearance of impropriety or conflict of 
interest arises.  
 
The following elements could be negotiated prior to contract signature. 
 
Elements Including, &nbsp;for &nbsp;example&hellip; 
Technical aspects Warranties, after sale service, life cycle support maintenance 
</p>
<p>agreements, quality output issues. 
Remedies Liquidated damages 
Special terms Type of bonds, guarantees, insurance, payment schedule. 
Management 
information 
</p>
<p>Frequency and content of reports; acceptance criteria for certain 
milestones. 
</p>
<p>Time frames Duration of contract, key milestones, delivery dates, response times. 
Performance 
incentives 
</p>
<p>Cost incentives, delivery incentives and quality incentives. 
</p>
<p>Personnel Key team members and focal points, subcontracting arrangements. 
 
In certain cases, the UN organization may not be able to impose on the supplier all their 
conditions of contract but may need to negotiate certain special conditions of contract. Especially 
in those cases where the supplier owns a proprietary product, the negotiating power of the 
organization may be reduced. 
  
Good practice 
Examples of good negotiation practice are: 
 
 In case of negotiations engaged prior to contract formation, the procurement officer should 
</p>
<p>ensure that a solicitation document has been sent to the supplier and that a written offer has 
been submitted by the supplier, and an Evaluation Report or an approval of award exists. 
</p>
<p> 
 Negotiations should not be conducted when they may distort competition. 
 
 Negotiations should preferably be in writing.  
 
 Where negotiations take place in person, via telephone, videoconference or at the site of the 
</p>
<p>supplier or the UN organization, a minimum of two staff members of the UN organization 
should be present. In unusual situations, or where there are high legal implications, involve a 
lawyer or the legal office in negotiations. </p>

</p>
<p> The members of the negotiation team need to be selected carefully to combine the right blend 
of negotiation experience and contractual, financial and/or technical skills. As the value and 
complexity of the contact increases, so will the need for skilled negotiators. 
</p>
<p> 
 During the negotiation process all procurement officers must ensure no conflict of interest 
</p>
<p>arises and no gifts or hospitality are accepted from the supplier.  
 
Process 
To conduct successful contract negotiations, it is suggested that the procurement officer follows 
each of the stages and corresponding steps listed in the table below:  
 
Step Action 
Stage 1: Pre-negotiate 
1 Assemble the internal team (including other procurement officers, the 
</p>
<p>requisitioner, other potential stakeholders and other departments of the UN 
organization whose activities may be impacted by certain clauses such as legal, 
accounts payable, insurance, security, etc.). 
</p>
<p>2  Identify and prioritise key issues and concessions that can be made. 
 Develop an agenda. 
 Prepare the location. 
 Identify a person to take notes and minutes. 
</p>
<p>3 Invite the other party to negotiate. 
Stage 2: Meet the other party 
</p>
<p>4  Make appropriate introductions. 
 Review the agenda. 
 Confirm &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;representative &nbsp;has &nbsp;authority &nbsp;to &nbsp;negotiate and commit 
</p>
<p>on behalf of his/her organization. 
 Ensure that all the items to be discussed are tabled. 
</p>
<p>Stage 3: Negotiation 
5 Develop a basis for agreement on all issues by using trade offs and concessions. 
6 Prepare detailed minutes of the meeting and plan of action for both parties. 
</p>
<p>Stage 4: Post negotiations 
7 Develop a contractual document and seek required internal approvals. 
</p>
<p> 
Documentation 
To ensure that the contract finalization process is fully documented and that a proper audit trail is 
kept, and also in case of future disputes with the supplier, written negotiations with the supplier 
should be kept on the file. Minutes of telephone conversations or meetings must be kept on file. 
It is also important to keep documentation to show that the negotiation was justified and 
approved. The minutes should include: 
 
 date time and location of the meeting 
 names of attendees 
 agenda items discussed 
 items where an agreement was reached, including outlining the agreement 
 items where agreements have not been reached.

</p>
<p>Contract preparation 
 
Procurement officers are encouraged to refer to existing templates or model contracts. If the 
contractual documents cannot be based on available templates, the procurement officer should 
ensure proper approvals and review by the appropriate officers before drafting new clauses. 
  
Contractual documents should be based on the: 
 
 solicitation document and subsequent amendments and/or clarifications 
 offer from the supplier and any subsequent amendments and/or clarifications 
 award recommendation 
 recommendations of the contracts committee, if applicable 
 final decision taken by the awarding authority. 
 
 
Contract review 
 
For complex contracts, a copy of the draft contract should be shared with the supplier. It is 
recommended that the supplier is given sufficient time to review the draft contract and request 
that any proposed changes or modifications to the text be provided in writing and are justified. If 
at this stage the supplier raises a legal issue, the procurement officer should ensure that proper 
consultation takes place. 
 
The supplier may request that its contractual template and/or additional or different terms and 
conditions are used. As a general rule, the procurement officer should always use the UN 
organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;templates. &nbsp;This &nbsp;ensures &nbsp;consistency, &nbsp;that &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;standard &nbsp;clauses &nbsp;are &nbsp;
included, etc. If this is not acceptable to the supplier, especially in the case of sole source 
requirements, &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organization, &nbsp;as &nbsp;an &nbsp;exception &nbsp;may &nbsp;have &nbsp;to &nbsp;agree &nbsp;to &nbsp;use &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;
contract &nbsp;template &nbsp;and &nbsp;amend &nbsp;it &nbsp;to &nbsp;ensure &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;interests &nbsp;are &nbsp;protected, &nbsp;
especially &nbsp;with &nbsp;respect &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;Privileges &nbsp;and &nbsp;Immunities &nbsp;and &nbsp;other &nbsp;essential &nbsp;
UN organization specific clauses, such as the arbitration clause, child labour, etc. 
 
The procurement officer should review the changes proposed by the supplier to determine that 
they do not conflict with the original requirement and the offer and that they are acceptable to the 
UN organization. After internal consultation and discussion with the successful supplier, the UN 
organization revises the draft until the text is acceptable to both parties.  
Care should be taken to ensure that the final text represents the offer from the supplier, as the UN 
organization accepted it, and that it remains in compliance with the final decision by the Head of 
Office. 
 
Finally, the procurement officer should ensure that the contract/purchase order (PO) is complete, 
that all the elements agreed by the parties and all appropriate annexes are included, and that the 
UN &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;general &nbsp;and &nbsp;special &nbsp;terms &nbsp;and &nbsp;conditions &nbsp;are &nbsp;part &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;contract/PO. 
 
In particular the procurement officer should ensure that: 
 
 No contract is entered into by the organization contrary to its general conditions of contract. 
</p>
<p>For example, procurement officers should always ensure that the contractual documents neither  
include a choice of law clause, nor refer to the jurisdiction of the courts of any particular 
country. These types of clauses would impair the UN organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;privileges &nbsp;and &nbsp;immunities &nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>as an international organization. All contractual documents clarify that the UN organization is 
exempt from taxes. 
</p>
<p> The Incoterm included in the contractual documents is the same as the one requested in the 
solicitation document. 
</p>
<p> A performance bond is presented by the supplier, if required as per the solicitation document, 
in a form acceptable to the UN organization; performance bonds should be kept in a safe and 
secured environment. 
</p>
<p> All essential elements of the PO or contract are included in the document. 
 The name, title and address of the parties are clearly reflected in the document. 
 
 
Contract signature 
 
Once the contract has been completed to the satisfaction of the UN organization, the 
procurement officer should seek all required internal approvals and print two (in some 
organizations three or four) copies of the contract and ensure that all pages are numbered and 
initialled by the procurement officer. The contract should be signed by an authorized 
representative of both the supplier and the UN organization. In case of purchase orders the 
supplier should send back an acknowledgement copy of the order to establish acceptance of the 
contract. The procurement officer should also ensure that proper securities are in place, e.g. 
performance bond. 
 
Procurement officers and requisitioners should always remember that any change or 
modification to an existing signed contract can only be documented by a written amendment, 
reviewed by the contracts committee as appropriate, and duly signed by the authorized 
representative of the parties. 
 
 
Contract filing 
 
The procurement officer should ensure that an original copy of the contract is filed and that the 
file is complete before proceeding with any other internal procedures, i.e. providing a copy to the 
requisitioning &nbsp;office, &nbsp;the &nbsp;freight &nbsp;forwarder &nbsp;where &nbsp;appropriate, &nbsp;the &nbsp;office&rsquo;s &nbsp;administration &nbsp;unit &nbsp;for &nbsp;
(digital) archiving of the contract, etc. 
 
 
Award notification and debriefing of unsuccessful suppliers 
 
Once the purchase order, contract or LTA has been legally established, i.e. only after proper 
signatures have been received from all parties concerned, an award notification should be 
published and the unsuccessful suppliers notified and de-briefed. 
 
Usually the UN organizations publish the award notifications on their internet site. Normally this 
includes the: 
 
 reference number of the solicitation 
 type of goods/services procured 
 name of the awarded supplier  
 total award value.

</p>
<p>In addition, unsuccessful suppliers may be notified via fax or email. Where a debriefing has been 
arranged, &nbsp;this &nbsp;should &nbsp;be &nbsp;a &nbsp;&ldquo;lessons &nbsp;learned&rdquo; &nbsp;experience &nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;unsuccessful &nbsp;supplier, &nbsp;enabling &nbsp;
the supplier to respond better to future solicitations. Therefore, the debriefing should focus on 
the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;offer. Some &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;&lsquo;dos&rsquo; &nbsp;and &nbsp;&lsquo;don&rsquo;ts&rsquo; &nbsp;of &nbsp;debriefings &nbsp;include: 
 
Do Do not 
Identify &nbsp;the &nbsp;unsuccessful &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;
significant weaknesses and deficiencies. 
</p>
<p>Compare the unsuccessful offer to the other offers, 
including the successful offer. 
</p>
<p>Explain the general basis of the UN 
organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;award &nbsp;decision. 
</p>
<p>Disclose the relative merits or technical standings 
nor prices of other offers. 
Provide any other information related to the 
successful offer other than the total price. 
</p>
<p> 
 
Elements of a contract 
 
With the exception of low value purchases (thresholds vary between organizations), a written 
contract is required to formalize an obligation. This is usually stipulated in the FRR of each 
organization. However, some organizations are now discussing e-contracts and e-procurement 
(see Unit 4.2 on E-Procurement). 
 
Legal elements of a contract 
The following are considered essential legal elements of a contract. 
 
Legal element Explanation 
Intent to contract 
 
</p>
<p>An agreement must be deliberate or seriously intended. In business, it 
is presumed that the parties intend to contract. 
</p>
<p>Offer and acceptance 
 
</p>
<p>An offer is an indication by one person to another of their willingness 
to contract on certain terms without further negotiations. A contract is 
then formed if there is express or implied agreement; acceptance may 
be by performance. A contract is said to come into existence when 
acceptance of an offer has been communicated to the supplier by the 
offeree.  
</p>
<p>Consideration 
 
</p>
<p>This &nbsp;is &nbsp;the &nbsp;&ldquo;price&rdquo; &nbsp;the &nbsp;buyer &nbsp;must &nbsp;pay &nbsp;to &nbsp;buy &nbsp;the &nbsp;promise &nbsp;made &nbsp;by the 
supplier, e.g. payment of money or exchange of services. 
</p>
<p>Capacity to contract This is the competency of a (legal) person to enter into a contract. 
Legality of purpose

<p>A contract will be void and unenforceable if its purpose involves an 
act which is illegal or contrary to public policy. 
</p>
<p>Certainty of terms 
 
</p>
<p>This requires a meeting of minds (consensus) regarding terms and

<p>Basic structure of a contract 
A contract usually includes the following parts: 
 
 clear and complete description of the work 
 price, basis of payment; method of payment 
 schedule of activities; delivery date 
 reference to solicitation documents 
 specific terms and conditions 
 general terms and conditions 
 other documents may be incorporated as necessary, e.g. written records of bid conferences, 
</p>
<p>email/mail correspondence, samples, etc. 
 
Terms and conditions of a contract 
A contract is composed of "clauses" (or numbered paragraphs) collectively referred to as "terms 
and conditions".  
 
 A "term" is a statement that deals with a specific topic, i.e. price, delivery, payment, inspection, 
</p>
<p>warranty, etc.  
 
 A "condition" is a statement that activates or suspends a term if a certain situation develops or 
</p>
<p>given parameters are met (e.g. revision to the unit price if the quantity varies by a certain ratio). 
 
 General and specific terms and conditions are intended to provide legally enforceable 
</p>
<p>provisions for securing satisfactory performance of the parties, the supplier and the UN 
organization.  
</p>
<p> 
 General terms and conditions pertain to a type of contract, such as service contracts, purchase 
</p>
<p>orders for goods, software license agreements, rental or lease of office space, etc. 
 
 Specific terms and conditions pertain to an individual contract.  
 
 Special terms and conditions may impose on prospective suppliers new and potentially un-
</p>
<p>necessary cost elements that they must incorporate in the pricing of goods and services they 
will have to deliver. For this reason, special terms and conditions must be chosen with care 
since they could affect the price the UN organization pays for its goods and services. The 
general terms and conditions of contract, read in conjunction with the special terms and 
conditions of contract, should be a complete document expressing all the rights and obligations 
of the parties. 
</p>
<p>  
Every contract for the purchase or rental / lease of goods, services, and other requirements 
should &nbsp;include &nbsp;the &nbsp;appropriate &nbsp;standard &nbsp;form &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;general &nbsp;terms &nbsp;and &nbsp;conditions &nbsp;
of contract. As they are standard legal documents of the organization, as a general principle, they 
should not be modified without prior consultation with the responsible legal authority within 
each organization. The UN organizations are currently working on a common set of such terms 
and conditions, called the UN General Conditions of Contract (UNGCC). The appropriate 
version to be used depends upon the deliverables to be acquired.

</p>
<p>The UN suggests that the following different types of UNGCC should exist: 
 
 contracts for the provision of goods only 
 contracts for the provision of services only 
 contracts for the provision of works only 
 contracts for the provision of goods and services 
 simple contracts primarily concluded in the field, for goods and / or services up to a certain 
</p>
<p>value, level of complexity, or level of liability exposure. 
 
For all the documents forming part of contractual instruments the order of precedence is very 
important. It is usually the terms and conditions of the specific purchase order/contract which 
prevail over the general terms and conditions and the rest of the documents. 
 
 
Examples of general terms and conditions of a contract 
Some examples of general terms and conditions of a contract are detailed below. 
 
Legal status 
This clause defines the legal status of the UN organization as well as the other parties of the 
contract. For example, a supplier to a UN organization is defined &nbsp;as &nbsp;being &nbsp;an &nbsp;&ldquo;independent &nbsp;
supplier&rdquo; &nbsp;and &nbsp;not &nbsp;an &nbsp;employee &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organization. &nbsp;It &nbsp;also &nbsp;defines &nbsp;the &nbsp;status, &nbsp;privileges &nbsp;and &nbsp;
immunities of a UN organization. 
 
Source of instructions 
This &nbsp;clause &nbsp;defines &nbsp;that &nbsp;&ldquo;the &nbsp;contractor &nbsp;shall &nbsp;neither &nbsp;seek &nbsp;nor &nbsp;accept &nbsp;instructions from any 
authority external to the UN organization concerned in connection with the performance under 
the &nbsp;concerned &nbsp;contract&rdquo;. &nbsp;This &nbsp;clause &nbsp;ensures &nbsp;that &nbsp;&ldquo;the &nbsp;interest &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organization &nbsp;is &nbsp;
protected and that the contractor shall refrain from any action that may adversely affect the UN 
organization&rdquo;. 
 
Contractor&rsquo;s &nbsp;responsibility &nbsp;for &nbsp;employees 
This clause requires that the contractor takes responsibility for its employees under the respective 
contract, and that only competent and reliable personnel who have high ethical standards and 
respect local customs are selected. It also reserves the right for the UN organization to screen and 
remove contractor staff. 
 
Assignment  
This clause prevents the supplier from assigning, transferring, pledging or making other 
dispositions of the contract, parts thereof, or any rights, claims or obligations under the contract 
to another party. The clause is intended to minimize the risk for the UN organization in cases 
where financial failure or changes in the legal status of the supplier would have an imminent 
effect on the contract performance. 
 
Sub-contracting 
This &nbsp;clause &nbsp;prescribes &nbsp;that, &nbsp;&ldquo;the &nbsp;contractor &nbsp;shall &nbsp;obtain &nbsp;the &nbsp;prior &nbsp;written &nbsp;approval &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN &nbsp;
organization in case the contractor wants to sub-contract parts or all of the contractual 
obligations &nbsp;to &nbsp;a &nbsp;third &nbsp;party&rdquo;. &nbsp;This &nbsp;is &nbsp;in &nbsp;line &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;clause &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;responsibility &nbsp;of &nbsp;
employees, and intended to ensure transparency regarding the parties to the contract.

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Officials not to benefit 
This clause determines that the supplier warrants that no official or representative of the United 
Nations has received or will be offered by the supplier any direct or indirect benefit arising from 
or related to the performance of the contract or the award thereof.  
 
Purchase of goods 
There is usually a set of clauses that defines the delivery, inspection, packing, transportation, 
warranties, acceptance, rejection, title and export licensing of goods. They are usually designed 
so that the terms and conditions of a main contract or a purchase order would supersede them, in 
whole or in part. Nevertheless, these provisions otherwise provide a safety net of legal terms 
concerning &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;rights &nbsp;and &nbsp;remedies &nbsp;with &nbsp;respect &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;acquisition &nbsp;of &nbsp;goods. &nbsp;
Warranties, for example, offer the UN organization remedies when manufacturing, workmanship 
or latent defects are discovered after products and services have been accepted.  
 
Indemnification 
This &nbsp;clause &nbsp;states &nbsp;that, &nbsp;&ldquo;the &nbsp;contractor &nbsp;shall &nbsp;indemnify, &nbsp;hold &nbsp;and &nbsp;safe &nbsp;harmless, &nbsp;and defend, at its 
own expense, the UN organization from and against all suits, claims, demands, and liability of 
any &nbsp;nature &nbsp;or &nbsp;kind, &nbsp;arising &nbsp;out &nbsp;of &nbsp;acts &nbsp;of &nbsp;omission &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;contractor&rdquo;. 
 
Insurance and liabilities to third parties 
This clause requires the supplier to maintain liability insurance for its equipment and property, 
and &nbsp;workmen&rsquo;s &nbsp;compensation &nbsp;for &nbsp;its &nbsp;workers. &nbsp;The &nbsp;clause &nbsp;aims &nbsp;to &nbsp;protect &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organization &nbsp;
against possible claims as the result of injury or damages that might result from performance 
under the contract. 
 
Encumbrances / liens 
An encumbrance is a claim attached to real property, such as a lien, mortgage or unpaid taxes. 
A lien is a legal claim against the property of another as security for the payment of debt. A lien 
gives the lienholder the right to sell the property to satisfy the debt if it is not otherwise paid. On 
the other hand, a lien is removed when a contract is paid. 
 
This clause prevents the supplier to cause or permit any lien, attachment or other encumbrance 
against any monies due or to become due for any work done or materials furnished under the 
contract, or by reason of any other claim or demand against the supplier. 
 
Title to equipment 
This &nbsp;clause &nbsp;prescribes &nbsp;that, &nbsp;&ldquo;the &nbsp;property &nbsp;right &nbsp;for &nbsp;any &nbsp;equipment &nbsp;or &nbsp;supplies &nbsp;that &nbsp;may be 
furnished by the UN organization shall rest with or be returned to the organization at the 
conclusion &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;contract &nbsp;or &nbsp;when &nbsp;no &nbsp;longer &nbsp;needed &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;contractor&rdquo;. 
 
Copyright, patents and other proprietary rights 
This clause recognizes the principle that if intellectual property is created for a UN organization, 
&ldquo;it &nbsp;shall &nbsp;own&rdquo; &nbsp;such &nbsp;property. 
 
Use of name, emblem or official seal of the United Nations organization 
This clause prohibits the supplier to disclose its contractual relationship with a UN organization 
for commercial purposes.

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Confidential nature of documents and information 
This clause constitutes a non-disclosure agreement between the parties to the contract for any 
data compiled by or received by any of the parties under the contract.  
 
Force majeur; other changes in condition 
This clause excuses delays or failure to perform that would otherwise constitute a contract 
breach and that are beyond the control or influence of the contracting parties. 
 
Termination 
This clause gives the right to terminate for any cause to each contracting party provided a notice 
of impending termination is given to the party being terminated within a specific time frame that 
varies according to the type of requirement and duration of contract. This minimizes the risk to a 
UN organization and the supplier by providing a means to ending its obligations in view of 
unforeseen circumstances while providing a means for the terminated party to cover its 
requirements or find other useful employment for its resources. 
 
Settlement of disputes 
This clause requires the resolution of disputes through UNICTRAL arbitration, when good faith 
negotiation, i.e. amicable settlement, fails to achieve agreement. 
 
Privileges and immunities 
This clause protects the privileges and immunities a UN organization has and states that, 
&ldquo;nothing &nbsp;in &nbsp;or &nbsp;related &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;contract &nbsp;shall &nbsp;be &nbsp;deemed &nbsp;a &nbsp;waiver &nbsp;to &nbsp;such &nbsp;privileges &nbsp;and &nbsp;
immunities&rdquo;. &nbsp; 
 
Tax exemption 
This clause states that the UN organization is exempt from all direct taxes and custom duties as 
stated in the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN. 
 
Observance of the Law 
This &nbsp;clause &nbsp;stipulates &nbsp;that, &nbsp;&ldquo;the &nbsp;contractor &nbsp;shall &nbsp;comply &nbsp;with &nbsp;all &nbsp;laws, &nbsp;ordinances, &nbsp;rules &nbsp;and &nbsp;
regulations bearing upon the performance of its obligations under the terms &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;contract&rdquo;. 
 
Authority to modify 
Such clause defines the way a contract may be modified, if appropriate. 
 
Conduct of contractors 
The following three elements should be subject to control through general terms and conditions: 
 
 prohibiting the supplier from using child labour 
 ensuring that the supplier does not manufacture or distribute anti-personnel mines, or 
</p>
<p>components thereof 
 ensuring that the supplier has put measures in place to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse. 
 
Gifts and hospitality 
This caluse &nbsp;states &nbsp;that &nbsp;&ldquo;Suppliers &nbsp;shall &nbsp;not &nbsp;offer &nbsp;gifts &nbsp;or &nbsp;hospitality &nbsp;to &nbsp;UN &nbsp;staff &nbsp;members. &nbsp;
Recreational trips to sporting or cultural events, theme parks or offers of holidays, transportation, 
or invitations to extravagant lunches or dinners are also prohibited&rdquo;.

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Examples of special terms and conditions 
 
Some examples of special terms and conditions of a contract are detailed below. 
 
Liquidated damages 
Liquidated damages are a form of redress to be paid by the supplier to the buyer in case of non 
performance or delayed delivery. For example, a fixed sum or percentage for each day the 
supplier is late delivering the equipment to the port. The sum is usually an estimate of the loss 
likely to be suffered by the client as a result of non performance.  
 
Method of payment 
The standard payment term for all UN organizations is 30 days net. However, the payment 
method may be negotiated with the supplier. Normally, UN organizations do not accept advance 
payments. For further information on the different payment methods see Unit 3.10 Contract 
Management. 
 
Performance securities / bonds 
A bond is a written financial instrument executed by a supplier and a second party (the surety or 
sureties) &nbsp;to &nbsp;ensure &nbsp;fulfilment &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;principal&rsquo;s &nbsp;obligations &nbsp;to &nbsp;a &nbsp;third &nbsp;party &nbsp;(the &nbsp;obligee or buyer), 
identified in the bond. The UN organizations require bonds to be unconditional and irrevocable.  
If the principal obligations are not met, the bond ensures payment, to the extent stipulated, of any 
loss sustained by the obligee. Bonds fill the role of insurance policy for the buyer to mitigate risk 
of frivolous offers or non performance by the supplier. Just like any insurance policy, the cost of 
the bond is a percentage of the face value of the policy and it is a cost borne by the supplier. 
 
Performance securities/bonds ensure the UN organization against non performance by the 
supplier. Performance bonds are used, for example, in works contracts and highly sensitive 
consulting contracts and are typically set at 10% of the value of the contract. 
 
These instruments are used in complex procurement where the cost of putting contracts together 
are high and the impact of non performance by the supplier could inflict serious damage to the 
UN organization. When required, performance bonds are a condition of the contract, and 
typically must be properly issued and accepted as a condition of effectiveness for the contract. 
 
Incoterms 
In the case of equipment, goods and commodities, the purchase order or contract must clearly 
indicate the point of transfer of responsibility for freight and risk from the supplier to the buyer. 
The International Chamber of Commerce Incoterms &ndash; short for "International Commercial 
Terms&rdquo; &nbsp;&ndash; are standard trade definitions most commonly used in international sales contracts to 
address these important issues, with distinct divisions of responsibility for the following 
functions: 
 
 packing goods for shipment 
 export clearance 
 transport from factory to port/airport of shipment 
 international transport 
 transport from port of arrival to final destination 
 handling 
 insurance during transport 
 import clearance </p>

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-86 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p> import duties. 
The scope of Incoterms is limited to matters relating to the rights and obligations of the parties to 
the contract of sale with respect to the costs and risks related to the delivery of goods sold.  They 
specify where the supplier delivers the goods, what costs the supplier pays, and when the 
supplier passes the transit risk to the buyer. The UN organizations typically use only a few of the 
Incoterms for the vast majority of its purchase of equipment, goods and commodities. See Unit 
4.3 Logistics for further details on Incoterms.  
 
 
Contractual instruments 
 
The different UN organizations use different types of contractual instruments. The most 
commonly used ones are: 
 
 letter of intent 
 purchase order (PO) 
 contract for services/works 
 contract for individual consultants/service agreements 
 long term arrangement/agreement/system contract, frame agreement, blanket purchase order 
 reimbursable loan agreements 
 amendments to contractual instruments. 
 
It is good practice to have model documents for each contractual instrument, differentiating the 
type of procurement,   For example, purchase order for goods and PO for services.  
 
Letter of intent 
This is a letter from a UN organization to a prospective supplier acknowledging willingness and 
ability to enter into a contract. This contractual instrument entails substantial risk, and must 
therefore be used only after careful risk assessment and authorized by the relevant delegated 
authority. It should only be used in exceptional cases and where time does not allow finalizing a 
definitive contract but exigency requires an immediate binding agreement so that the supplier 
can initiate contract performance before signing the contract by all parties. The most important 
principle is that a letter of intent must never be sent before an approval of award has been 
received from the highest ranking procurement officer in the organization or the respective 
delegated authority.  If a letter of intent is used, it is good practice to: 
 
 use a standard format for the letter of intent 
 include &nbsp;clauses &nbsp;limiting &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;responsibilities &nbsp;and &nbsp;allowing &nbsp;it &nbsp;to &nbsp;withdraw &nbsp;with &nbsp;
</p>
<p>minimum legal and financial obligations. 
 
Purchase order (PO) 
A purchase order (PO) is a contract sent to suppliers to document the purchase of goods. POs are 
the most commonly used contract type, and compared to other contracts sometimes they a more 
simplified/standardized document. They are usually only used for the purchase of goods but may 
specify related services such as installation, training, and maintenance. They should always 
include &nbsp;or &nbsp;refer &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;general &nbsp;terms &nbsp;and &nbsp;conditions &nbsp;for &nbsp;goods. &nbsp; &nbsp;POs &nbsp;can &nbsp;also &nbsp;be &nbsp;
used to draw upon long term arrangements.

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-87 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Contract for services/works   
A contract for services/works establishes a set of obligations between the contractual parties for 
the procurement of services or works. This contract instrument is better suited to complex 
services or work, or mutual obligations between the parties and should always include or refer to 
the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;general &nbsp;terms &nbsp;and &nbsp;conditions &nbsp;for &nbsp;services &nbsp;or &nbsp;works. &nbsp; 
 
Where goods and services are combined, or quality levels are linked to product performance, or 
for large and complex projects, the trend is to use &nbsp;&ldquo;performance &nbsp;based &nbsp;contracts&rdquo;. &nbsp;This &nbsp;means &nbsp;
that the whole acquisition is structured around the purpose and the outcome of the work to be 
performed and not the manner in which the work is to be performed. Performance based 
contracts: 
 
 Describe the requirements in terms of performance results required, rather than the methods of 
</p>
<p>performance of the work. 
 Give the supplier greater freedom to determine how to achieve the required outcome. 
 Use measurable performance standards and a quality assurance surveillance plan. 
 Include incentives and disincentives for when services exceed or do not meet contract 
</p>
<p>requirements and specify procedures for handling those situations. 
 
Contract for individual consultants / service agreements 
Service agreements are contracts whereby the organization enters into an agreement with a 
commercial company for the services of an individual. Service agreements are different from 
service contracts. Service contracts define the scope of work to be completed, whereas service 
agreements define specific terms of reference for an individual. 
 
Long term agreement / system contract, frame agreement, blanket purchase order 
For further information about LTAs, see Unit 3.4 Selection of Procurement Method. 
 
Reimbursable loan agreements 
In some organizations reimbursable loan agreements are used to contract a government 
institution, university, or other legal entity (minimum three staff), to engage consultancy services 
of selected individuals to undertake specific services for a specific time period.  
 
 
Amendments to contractual instruments 
 
An amendment to a contractual instrument ("contract amendment") is a written record of 
changes to the original terms and conditions. It is executed to reflect changes to the original 
requirement, to reflect the resolution of performance problems or to comply with formal 
administrative considerations. 
 
When the organization receives a request from a supplier to modify a contract, it should review 
the request in order to analyse its impact on the schedule of completion, price, quantity and 
quality. The organization should consult with the client on all aspects of the request and 
determine whether the request may best be executed through the current contract or, if 
substantial changes in scope are called for, through new procurement. A contract amendment 
may cover the following matters: 
 
 extension of time to complete the contract 
 change to specifications </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-88 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p> change to price 
 administrative changes like change of name, legal status, address, etc. 
 
Only an authorized UN staff member can officially change a contract. Unofficial changes, in the 
form of constructive changes or unauthorized commitments can be as detrimental to the UN 
organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;process &nbsp;as &nbsp;purchases &nbsp;originally &nbsp;made &nbsp;without &nbsp;appropriate &nbsp;delegated &nbsp;
authority. 
 
Requisitioners are required to provide requisition amendments when changes in price, type, or 
quantity of items to be purchased are needed. As appropriate, requisitioners also should provide 
additional documentation to support the need for the modification. 
 
Documentation requirements 
Documentation to support contract modification includes: 
 
 revised statement of work (SOW) 
 justification as to why the modification is necessary 
 revised cost estimate accounting for increases and decreases in the products or services and 
</p>
<p>associated costs made by the modification, providing either: 
 a statement that the modification is within the current expenditure authority, or 
 a fully approved increase in the current expenditure authority to cover any costs above the 
</p>
<p>current expenditure authority 
 requisition number (and obligating number, if relevant) 
 approval date of initial requisition 
 brief description of the amendment. 
 
Good practice 
It is good practice to: 
 Use standard formats for contract amendments to introduce changes to the original contract, 
</p>
<p>and earlier amendments, by reference to the clauses of the original contract and of its 
amendments. 
</p>
<p> Not, under any circumstance, execute a contract amendment by corrections or deletions on the 
original contract document. 
</p>
<p> Always make any amendment to a contractual instrument in writing. 
 Always document amendments in the contract file. 
 
 
Types of contracts 
 
The most common types of contracts provide for payments on the basis of: 
 
 fixed prices, such as lump sum or a unit price contracts, or 
 reimbursable cost, or  
 combinations thereof. 
 
Lump sum contracts 
With a lump sum contract, the supplier agrees to perform the work for one fixed price, regardless 
of the ultimate cost. 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-89 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Lump sum contracts are used mainly for assignments in which the content and the duration of 
the services and the required output of the supplier are clearly defined. They are widely used for 
simple planning and feasibility studies, environmental studies, detailed design of standard or 
common structures, preparation of data processing systems, and so forth. Payments are linked to 
outputs (deliverables), such as reports, drawings, and bills of quantities, etc.  Lump sum 
contracts are easy to administer because payments are due on clearly specified outputs.  It is 
recommended that a detailed scope of services or BoQs be defined. 
 
Unit price / unit rate contracts 
A unit price / unit rate contract is a contract where the supplier agrees to supply goods/services/ 
works at fixed unit prices / rates and the final price is dependent on the quantities needed to carry 
out the work. Large quantity changes can lead to decreases or increases in unit prices/rates. 
 
This type of contract is suitable when it is impossible, due to the nature of the services/work/ 
goods, to determine with sufficient precision the quantity of services/works/goods required from 
the supplier. 
 
In this case the buyer and the supplier share the risk for time and cost as follows: 
 
 The buyer is at risk for the final total quantities, i.e. the final cost is not known. 
 The supplier is at risk for the fixed unit price / rate. 
 
Cost-reimbursable contracts 
Cost-reimbursable contracts are recommended only in exceptional circumstances such as 
conditions of high risk or where costs cannot be determined in advance with sufficient accuracy. 
Such contracts should include appropriate incentives to limit cost, e.g. ceiling price. 
 
The risk of cost-reimbursable contracts is carried by the buyer as the supplier has no incentive to 
control costs, or to finish early or in time. The buyer has to closely monitor and manage the 
contract.

<p>3.10 Contract Management 
 
Introduction 
 
The &nbsp;terms &nbsp;&ldquo;contract &nbsp;management&rdquo; &nbsp;and &nbsp;&ldquo;contract &nbsp;administration&rdquo; &nbsp;are &nbsp;often &nbsp;used &nbsp;synonymously. &nbsp;
However, &nbsp;&ldquo;contract &nbsp;management&rdquo; &nbsp;is &nbsp;commonly &nbsp;understood &nbsp;as &nbsp;a &nbsp;broader and more strategic 
concept that covers the whole procurement cycle including planning, formation, execution, 
administration &nbsp;and &nbsp;close &nbsp;out &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;contract &nbsp;and &nbsp;goes &nbsp;beyond &nbsp;the &nbsp;day &nbsp;to &nbsp;day &nbsp;&ldquo;administrative&rdquo; &nbsp;
activities in the procurement cycle. Because it is difficult to draw the line between the two terms 
and &nbsp;because &nbsp;the &nbsp;majority &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organizations &nbsp;commonly &nbsp;use &nbsp;&ldquo;contract &nbsp;management&rdquo; &nbsp;when &nbsp;
describing &nbsp;the &nbsp;contract &nbsp;administration &nbsp;phase, &nbsp;&ldquo;contract &nbsp;management&rdquo; &nbsp;will &nbsp;be &nbsp;used &nbsp;in &nbsp;this &nbsp;Unit. 
 
The purpose of contract management is to ensure that all parties to the contract fully meet their 
respective obligations as efficiently and effectively as possible, delivering the business and 
operational outputs required from the contract and providing value for money. It also protects the 
rights of the parties and ensures required performance when circumstances change. 
 
Contract management is similar to project management. Each contract is a mini-project. It has a 
unique goal, consumes resources, has a beginning and end date, and requires coordination and 
planning of relevant activities, as well as documentation in a contract file throughout the process. 
 
Contract management includes monitoring and documenting performance. Depending on the 
organization and goods or services procured, daily/regular monitoring of the contract may be 
primarily the responsibility of the requisitioner.  
 
In all situations, the procurement officer is responsible for following up and ensuring that the 
actions of the supplier and the UN organization are in line with the contractual responsibilities, 
that the contract is amended to reflect agreed changes in circumstances, and that any claim or 
dispute is resolved amicably according to the terms of the contract. 
 
Payment for the goods or services should be handled independently from the procurement 
function, while contract close out again is the responsibility of the procurement officer. 
 
The stages of contract management are intended to ensure that the parties work together to 
achieve the objectives of the contract. Contract management is based on the idea that the contract 
is an agreement, a partnership with rights and obligations that must be met by both sides to 
achieve the goal. Contract management is aimed not at finding fault, but rather at identifying 
problems and finding solutions together with all contracting parties involved.

Enabling contract management  
 
In this phase the procurement officer ensures that there is a shared understanding, distribution of 
responsibilities and systems and procedures in place to monitor and control contract performance 
and effectively deal with potential changes and disputes.  
 
The supplier should be considered a member of the project team, with all members striving for 
success. Upon signature of the contract, several steps should be taken to ensure that roles, 
responsibilities and obligations are clearly allocated among the parties and proper systems and 
procedures are put in place to monitor performance and keep efforts well focused: 
 
Contract file and documentation 
The contract file should be opened by the procurement officer, and the contract should be 
carefully analysed, taking note of the rights and obligations of each party. Any issues requiring 
clarification or change of the contract should be fully documented in this file. (The requisitioner 
will normally have a separate file, with copy of the contract, as part of the project management 
files.) 
 
Although practice may vary among organizations, the following documents normally are part of 
the contract file: 
 
 original of contract and all amendments 
 all related communication with the supplier (electronic, internal and external correspondence) 
 copy of the winning offer 
 award documents 
 minutes of meetings 
 notes of phone conversations 
 reports 
 pictures, video films 
 proof of receipt of goods 
 proof of payment 
 supplier assessment report 
 acceptance report from requisitioner/client.

</p>
<p>Other related documents preceding the contract finalization, such as Requisition, solicitation 
document, offers received, evaluation report, etc. are usually part of other related files. 
 
It is important to carefully document contract performance for the following reasons: 
 It constitutes proof of performance. 
 It constitutes evidence in the event of disputes. 
 Its content forms the institutional memory. 
 It is used for audit purposes. 
 
Contract analysis 
As soon as possible, the responsible UN staff member (programme manager, requisitioner, or 
procurement officer) should analyse the terms and conditions of the prospective contract and 
develop a contract work breakdown structure that reflects both the technical and administrative 
aspects of contract performance. The requisitioner and the procurement officer should reach 
agreement on intermediate performance goals based on contract performance obligations. 
Intermediate goals will enable the UN organization to measure progress, detect significant 
performance variances, take corrective action, and follow up.  
 
Pre-performance conference 
Before performance begins on large or complex contracts, the procurement officer and the 
requisitioner &nbsp;should &nbsp;meet &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;team &nbsp;to &nbsp;discuss &nbsp;their &nbsp;understanding &nbsp;and &nbsp;joint &nbsp;
administration of the contract. 
 
The following is considered good practice:  
 the meeting should be formal 
 an agenda should be distributed in advance, minutes should be taken and agreed by the parties.  
 each &nbsp;party &nbsp;should &nbsp;appoint &nbsp;a &nbsp;person &nbsp;who &nbsp;will &nbsp;be &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;official &nbsp;voice during contract 
</p>
<p>performance.  
 
The following topics should be covered by the parties:  
 Review the contract terms and conditions and other key elements and explain who will do 
</p>
<p>what.  
 Update the project/programme plan with the involvement of both parties, to reflect the actual 
</p>
<p>date of effectiveness as well as milestones/deliverables of the contract and any changes which 
may have occurred since it was planned.  
</p>
<p> Review the performance assessment plan with the supplier, so that both parties know the basis 
upon which performance will be established. These should be understood as milestones for 
joint monitoring and not as contractual obligations. 
</p>
<p> Discuss how and when to measure and report actual performance. The techniques, timing, and 
frequency of measurement and reporting should reflect the nature and criticality of the work. A 
reasonable balance must be struck between no measurement/reporting of any kind and 
excessive reporting.  
</p>
<p> Clarify any remaining ambiguities and discuss procedures for managing change and resolving 
differences.  
</p>
<p> Clarify the communication plan. 
 
For simple goods or equipment purchase orders, a telephone or email contact is often sufficient 
to launch activities, supported by regular expediting and monitoring.

</p>
<p>Effective communication 
Successful contract management is based on an open flow of communication and willingness to 
take actions necessary for correction and improvement, and is facilitated by: 
 Attitude of teamwork, seeking to get the best results from joint efforts, willingness to discuss 
</p>
<p>problems without immediate recourse to recriminations and to make the immediate 
adjustments that may be necessary to correct problems detected through routine inspection. 
</p>
<p> Well organized oral and written reporting system, which highlights progress and problems and 
measures them against expected performance and results. 
</p>
<p> Contract performance and progress review meetings at appropriate intervals. For complex 
works and services contracts, such meetings could be as frequent as every two weeks or as 
infrequent as every two months. For goods procurement, it may be sufficient to have an email 
or telephone follow-up every few weeks. 
</p>
<p> 
For procurement of goods, contract monitoring and control is largely covered by expediting, pre-
shipment inspection and final receipt and acceptance. 
 
The policy of compliance with contract terms and conditions requires that organizations maintain 
effective communication about, and control over, contract performance. Each party to the 
contract should establish communication procedures to ensure that people within their 
organization know what they must do, and each party should establish controls to ensure that 
they do it.  
 
It is equally important that the parties to the contract communicate with each other, as often as 
may be necessary. &nbsp;A &nbsp;contract &nbsp;is &nbsp;a &nbsp;&ldquo;meeting &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;minds&rdquo; &nbsp;made &nbsp;at &nbsp;a &nbsp;prior &nbsp;point &nbsp;in &nbsp;time. &nbsp;Like &nbsp;all &nbsp;
human &nbsp;relationships, &nbsp;contracts &nbsp;are &nbsp;dynamic;; &nbsp;the &nbsp;original &nbsp;&ldquo;meeting &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;minds&rdquo; &nbsp;may &nbsp;have &nbsp;been &nbsp;
inaccurate or frustrated by events. 
 
As performance proceeds and events unfold, the parties will find that they may have to modify 
their original expectations and plans to adjust to real events. As they do so, they will have to 
modify the terms and conditions of their contract so that it reflects the current status of their 
agreement. This is an inevitable part of contracting, because no one can predict the future with 
perfect accuracy. However, it is important that the parties do this consciously and openly, and 
with an attitude of teamwork, so that they remain in agreement about what they are doing. If they 
do not communicate, they could end up mitigating a dispute over what their obligations really 
are. 
 
 
Contract performance monitoring and control 
 
Once the contract has been awarded, the responsible procurement officer, or the requisitioner, 
monitors performance, collects information, and measures actual contract achievement. This is 
essential for effective control. The resources devoted to these tasks, and the techniques used to 
perform them, will depend on the nature of the contract work, the size and complexity of the 
contract, and the resources available. 
 
For small, simple, non-critical contracts, an occasional telephone call may be all that is needed to 
satisfy the responsible UN staff member that everything is proceeding according to plan. 
However, for large, complex contracts, the responsible UN staff member may require extensive 
reports, regular progress meetings, formal testing, and technical reviews and audits.

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>In performance based contracts, performance indicators developed in the contract are used. In 
some &nbsp;cases, &nbsp;the &nbsp;proposed &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;quality &nbsp;assurance &nbsp;plan &nbsp;may &nbsp;be &nbsp;used &nbsp;as &nbsp;a &nbsp;basis &nbsp;for &nbsp;monitoring &nbsp;
the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;performance. 
 
Observations are made in order to collect information related to those aspects of performance 
that, when measured, will describe the progress of the work. The reason for observing, collecting 
information, and measuring progress is to have a basis for comparing actual achievement with 
planned achievement in order to exert control. Each party must direct its attention internally to 
ensure that it is fulfilling its own obligations, and externally to ensure that the other party is 
fulfilling its obligations. 
 
Control points 
Observing and collecting information should be directed at four general control points.  These 
include:  
 
 cost control 
 schedule control 
 compliance with specifications, terms of reference, statement of work (quality assurance and 
</p>
<p>control) 
 compliance with terms and conditions, paperwork requirements, and administrative aspects of 
</p>
<p>the performance. 
 
Monitoring methods 
There are two different monitoring methods: direct observation and indirect observation. 
 
Direct observation 
Direct observation means personal, physical observation. The responsible UN staff member, or a 
field representative, is physically present at the work site during its performance to see how it is 
progressing. This approach is most practical when the work is physical in nature and performed 
at a limited number of sites. 
 
Construction projects are examples of work readily subject to direct observation. The inspector 
goes to the site and visually inspects the work, comparing observations to the construction 
specifications and drawings to the schedule to determine the progress of the job. 
Direct observation by the responsible UN staff member or field representative is of limited use, 
however, when the work is largely intellectual in nature, or when it is too complex for physical 
inspection alone to provide enough information to measure progress. In these cases, direct 
observation should be supplemented or replaced by indirect observation. 
 
Indirect observation 
Indirect observation refers to testing, progress reports from many observers, technical reviews, 
performance indicators and audits. Indirect observation is appropriate whenever direct 
observation would provide insufficient or ambiguous information. For example, projects 
involving an intellectual effort like infrastructure analysis where personal observations at the 
offices where the work is performed are unlikely to reveal whether the work is ahead of 
schedule, on schedule, or behind schedule. 
 
Receipt, inspection and acceptance procedures 
Inspection involves examining or testing a product or service to ensure that it conforms to 
contract requirements. Where quantities of goods are involved, inspection also means verifying </p>

</p>
<p>that the correct number of items has been delivered. Some organizations may have LTAs or one-
off contracts with inspection agents, while others may have in-house experts who undertake 
plant visits and inspections. Generally, there are the following types of inspection methods: 
 
 sensory and dimensional checks 
 physical performance checks 
 destructive tests. 
 
Sensory and dimensional checks 
Sensory and dimensional checks are examinations by an inspector using his or her eyes, ears, and 
other senses. The inspector exercises a good amount of personal judgment. For a commercially 
available automatic pencil sharpener, for example, this method reveals surface defects, missing 
pieces, noisy operation, and parts out of alignment. For custodial services, for example, visual 
inspection detects surfaces that are not clean. 
 
The UN organizations typically use sensory and dimensional checks to perform inspections. 
When using this method, UN staff at the receiving point (that is, the UN office or field mission 
using the item) should check the following: 
 
 Make a visual examination to verify that the proper type and kind of product has been 
</p>
<p>delivered, that is, that the product or service conforms to the specifications outlined in the order 
or contract. 
</p>
<p> Conduct a physical count to ensure that the correct quantity of product has been delivered by 
comparing the quantity received with the quantity ordered. Variations in quantities authorized 
by the order or contract may be accepted. Quantities accepted must be documented; payment is 
based on quantities accepted. 
</p>
<p> Check for signs of damage, such as dents and tears. Any damage should be documented.  
 Perform an operability check to ensure that the product performs or operates properly, if 
</p>
<p>applicable. 
 Check the preservation of the product to ensure that it has not spoiled, rusted, or deteriorated, if 
</p>
<p>applicable.  
 If &nbsp;applicable, &nbsp;check &nbsp;packaging &nbsp;and &nbsp;labelling &nbsp;to &nbsp;ensure &nbsp;that &nbsp;they &nbsp;comply &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;contract&rsquo;s &nbsp;
</p>
<p>requirements. 
 Check packing to ensure that it is adequate, if applicable. 
 Check marking to ensure that it properly identifies packages, if applicable. 
 
Any items that do not conform to appropriate standards should not be accepted. A receipt and 
inspection report should be submitted, noting any non-conforming item. 
 
Physical or performance tests 
Physical or performance tests provide actual performance data that are compared with required 
performance or physical characteristics or a range of what is considered acceptable according to 
the contract. Requiring that a motor runs or an operating system performs at a certain level for a 
specific period of time is an example of a performance test. Testing materials for their chemical 
composition or density against parameters in the specification are examples of physical tests. On 
a bus service contract, waiting at a particular bus stop to see whether the bus arrives on time is a 
performance test to check compliance with the required schedule. Performance tests for labour-
intensive services are often done as a random sample.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Destructive tests  
Destructive tests require that end products meet certain reliability standards or withstand a 
specific level of stress. For example, heating a product until it burns tests the fireproof 
characteristics of an end product. Scratching through newly applied coats of paint shows the 
number of coats applied by a painting supplier. 
 
Acceptance or rejection standards 
Acceptance or rejection of products or services must be based on the standards identified in the 
contract or purchase order. Generally, the UN organizations rely on two types of standards: 
 
 Strict compliance standards: Requirements based on specific UN technical descriptions. 
 Subjective standards: Requirements based on a broader, more judgmental, criterion as applied 
by &nbsp;the &nbsp;inspector. &nbsp;Examples &nbsp;of &nbsp;subjective &nbsp;standards &nbsp;might &nbsp;be &nbsp;&ldquo;comfortable &nbsp;fit&rdquo; &nbsp;or &nbsp;&ldquo;easy &nbsp;
operation. 
</p>
<p> 
It is not unusual to have both types of standards apply to different aspects of one purchase. In 
such cases, both strict compliance standards and subjective standards must be enforced. But if 
both standards apply to a single aspect of the purchase, they typically are inconsistent with each 
other and, therefore, unenforceable. 
 
Both types of standards can be applied to different aspects of service requirements as well. For 
example, a contract for grass-cutting services may state that the grass will be cut once a week &ndash; 
which is a strict compliance standard &ndash; or that the grass must always be neat and trimmed &ndash; 
which is a subjective standard. The basis for acceptance or rejection must be in accordance with 
the &nbsp;contract&rsquo;s &nbsp;stated &nbsp;requirements &nbsp;as &nbsp;shown &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;table &nbsp;below. 
 
Requirement type Refers &nbsp;to&hellip; 
End-item versus level-
of-effort requirement 
</p>
<p>Contract terms with may require delivery of end items, which may 
include finished services, or may require a stated level of effort over a 
specified period of time. 
</p>
<p>End-item requirement 
 
</p>
<p>A measurable product of work, such as a management analysis report 
to be delivered in camera-ready form or the manufacturing of a 
product as required by technical descriptions. This type of requirement 
states a specific time for delivery or completion. Rejection, or other 
remedies, may be appropriate if the end item is deficient or delivered 
late. 
</p>
<p>Level-of-effort 
requirement 
</p>
<p>An amount of work, a level of effort, applied toward a specific 
objective or performed during a specified period of time. The level of 
effort &nbsp;itself &nbsp;is &nbsp;the &nbsp;deliverable. &nbsp;A &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;obligation &nbsp;to &nbsp;provide &nbsp;the &nbsp;
level of effort ends when the contract expires, even if the objective is 
not met. The only basis of rejection or application of remedies is the 
manner in which the effort was applied during contract performance. 
</p>
<p> 
Inspection and acceptance or rejection of products and services, determine whether the UN 
organization should make payment to the supplier.

Receipt and inspection documentation 
Inspections may be interim or final and receipt may be in full or partial.  </p>

</p>
<p>organizations usually use standard forms/reports to acknowledge that the inspection has been 
performed and to record whether products/services have been accepted or rejected.  UN 
organizations &nbsp;now &nbsp;increasingly &nbsp;use &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;ERP &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;software &nbsp;to &nbsp;record &nbsp;
delivery and related aspects of contract completion electronically. 
 
Progress meetings 
Progress meetings can simply be oral progress reports. They provide some advantages and 
disadvantages over written reports. An advantage is that the listeners can ask questions about the 
information, analyses, and conclusions reported and can have discussions with the reporter. A 
disadvantage is that the listeners may not have time during the meeting to consider the 
information and make their own analyses before the meeting ends. 
 
Written reports 
Written &nbsp;reports &nbsp;rarely &nbsp;provide &nbsp;&ldquo;real &nbsp;time&rdquo; &nbsp;information. They do not tell the reader how things are 
now; they provide the reader only a picture of some point of time in the past. How old the 
information &nbsp;is &nbsp;depends &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;nature &nbsp;and &nbsp;frequency &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;report &nbsp;and &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;reporter&rsquo;s &nbsp;
capabilities. A cost/schedule performance report that is submitted on 1 June, and that depends on 
accounting information, may actually describe cost/schedule status as of 30 April or earlier, 
depending &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;capabilities &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;seller&rsquo;s &nbsp;accounting &nbsp;system. 
 
Report conclusions about project status are valid only if the information on which they are based 
is accurate and the analyst is competent, realistic, and honest.  
 
In deciding to rely wholly or in part on reports (including meetings), the responsible UN staff 
member also needs to decide what information each report must contain. Some of the issues that 
should be considered according to the contract reporting guidelines of the organization are: 
 
 What aspect(s) of performance should the report address? 
 What information should the report include: conclusions about performance, analyses, raw 
</p>
<p>information, or some combination of these? 
 How frequently must the report be submitted, and at what points in time? 
 What is the cut-off &nbsp;point &nbsp;(&ldquo;as &nbsp;of&rdquo; &nbsp;date) &nbsp;for &nbsp;information &nbsp;to &nbsp;be &nbsp;included &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;report? 
 In what format should the report be submitted? 
 To whom should the report be submitted, and to whom should copies be sent? 
 
Variance analysis 
It is not enough to observe and collect information about performance; that information should 
be analysed to determine whether or not performance is satisfactory. The analyst compares 
actual performance to performance goals to determine whether there are variances. The 
responsible UN staff member who discovers a variance between actual and expected 
performance should determine several things: Is it significant? What was its cause? Was it a one-
time failure, or is it a continuing problem? What type of corrective action would be most 
effective? 
 
Variance analysis should be timely, especially when the information is obtained through reports. 
That information is already old by the time it has been received. Delays in analysing its 
significance may allow poor performance to deteriorate further, perhaps beyond hope of 
effective corrective action. It is especially important to act promptly during the early phases of 
contract performance, when corrective action is likely to have the greatest effect. In case of 
negative contract performance a review of information in the contract file frequently shows that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-98 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>there were warning signs &ndash; reports, meeting minutes, letters, memos &ndash; that were unnoticed or 
ignored. When the responsibility for monitoring performance is delegated, the responsible UN 
staff member must take steps to ensure that those persons promptly analyse the information, 
report their findings, and take corrective action. 
 
Taking corrective action 
When the requisitioner or the procurement officer discovers significant variance between actual 
and expected performance, they should take corrective action if possible. They should identify 
the cause of the problem and determine a solution that will not only eliminate it as a source of 
future difficulty, but correct the effect it has already had, if possible. If the effect cannot be 
corrected, then the parties may need to negotiate a change to the contract, with compensation to 
the injured party, if appropriate. 
 
Follow up 
Once corrective action has been taken or is under way, the procurement officer and the 
requisitioner should determine whether it has had or is having the desired effect. If not, then 
further action may be needed.  
 
Throughout this process of corrective action and follow-up, all the parties must keep each other 
informed. Effective communication between the parties is essential to avoid misunderstandings 
and disputes when things are not proceeding according to plan. The party taking corrective 
action must make every effort to let the other party know that it is aware of the problem and is 
addressing it seriously. Sometimes this is more important than the corrective action itself. 
 
 
Change management 
 
Change management is the process of both avoiding unwanted changes and incorporating 
necessary changes into the contract.  
 
Effectively controlling changes entails establishing formal procedures for changing the contract 
and limiting the number of people who are entitled to make changes.  
 
It is natural for staff in one contract party to work directly with their counterparts in the other 
contract &nbsp;party&rsquo;s &nbsp;organization, &nbsp;people &nbsp;who &nbsp;speak &nbsp;their &nbsp;language &nbsp;and &nbsp;understand &nbsp;their &nbsp;policies and 
customs. These colleagues often bypass formal channels of communication, and such 
relationships can lead to informal, undocumented agreements that depart from contract terms and 
conditions. Such informal agreements often lead to situations of unauthorized commitment or 
forbearance caused by apparent authority communicated involuntarily by the requisitioner. It is 
important that all parties keep in mind that the written contract is the agreement, until it has been 
formally modified &ndash; such modification is not simply a formality. 
 
&ldquo;Constructive &nbsp;change&rdquo; &nbsp;used &nbsp;to &nbsp;describe &nbsp;a &nbsp;contract &nbsp;change, &nbsp;derives &nbsp;from &nbsp;the &nbsp;verb &nbsp;&ldquo;to &nbsp;construe&rdquo; &nbsp;
and &nbsp;not &nbsp;from &nbsp;the &nbsp;verb &nbsp;&ldquo;to &nbsp;construct.&rdquo; &nbsp;So, &nbsp;a &nbsp;constructive &nbsp;change &nbsp;is &nbsp;a &nbsp;situation &nbsp;that &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;
construed as having the effect of a bona fide contract change. A constructive change occurs 
when the procurement officer, or other duly authorized official, changes the contract without 
applying proper legal and regulatory procedures. A constructive change can result from either a 
specific action or a failure to act. Constructive changes need not have a cost impact; 
unauthorized commitments always do.

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>The possibility of a constructive change places the UN organization in a poor negotiating 
position when renegotiating price or cost or other contract term or condition. Discussion with the 
supplier of constructive changes should be avoided as constructive changes destroy any 
possibility of pre-pricing and put the UN organization in a poor negotiating position. Unless 
changes are documented in a contract modification, a misunderstanding between UN staff and 
supplier personnel is likely to result. 
 
Financial changes 
Financial changes include in particular: 
 
 Cost overruns, in which the cost of carrying out an agreed activity is greater than the agreed 
</p>
<p>amount. The UN organization seeks to avoid this situation, and selects outputs and payment 
methods to make it less likely to occur. 
</p>
<p> Cost growth, when activities not included in the original contract are added, they usually bring 
accompanying costs. Careful planning and choice of language should reduce the frequency of 
this situation, but it is still likely to occur in complex construction and services contracts. 
</p>
<p> 
Cost overruns versus cost growth 
When accepting a contract, a supplier intends to make it profitable by ensuring it can control its 
costs. &nbsp;Failure &nbsp;to &nbsp;do &nbsp;so &nbsp;will &nbsp;undermine &nbsp;the &nbsp;contract&rsquo;s &nbsp;profitability. &nbsp;The &nbsp;supplier &nbsp;will &nbsp;manage &nbsp;its &nbsp;
business risk in a manner that will eliminate wherever possible potential for cost overruns. UN 
organizations also seek to structure contracts and administration to avoid responsibility for cost 
overruns. 
 
Cost overrun 
Examples of sources of potential cost overruns are: 
 currency rate fluctuation 
 underestimation of level of effort 
 underestimation of costs of material 
 increase in cost of materials or labour 
 undocumented cost growth. 
 
Cost growth 
Cost growth is defined as a change in the scope of work or new terms and conditions that have 
been requested by the buyer. The supplier may accept cost growth provided the contract change 
is documented and that the contract is amended accordingly. 
 
Delays and variations 
Handling claims of delays and variations involves dealing with circumstances where a supplier 
makes a claim for additional unforeseen work or costs, or where the UN organization has varied 
their requirements from the supplier. Typical delays and variations which should be handled 
include: 
 
 delays (excusable, non-excusable, shared/concurrent) 
 minor variations to scope of work or execution conditions. 
 
 
The three most significant types of contract delays can be grouped as follows: 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-100 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p> excusable delays 
 non-excusable delays 
 shared or concurrent delays. 
 
Excusable delays 
Excusable delays are delays beyond the control of the supplier and without any fault or 
negligence on the supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;part. &nbsp;These &nbsp;include &nbsp;delays &nbsp;caused &nbsp;or &nbsp;authorized &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN &nbsp;
organization &nbsp;and &nbsp;delays &nbsp;caused &nbsp;by &nbsp;acts &nbsp;of &nbsp;God &nbsp;or &nbsp;other &nbsp;events &nbsp;beyond &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;control, &nbsp;
such as fire, flood, acts of war, and so on. This is the only type of delay for which extending the 
period of performance without obtaining consideration from the supplier is appropriate. Some 
excusable delays do entitle the supplier to monetary compensation in the form of an increase to a 
fixed-price/lump-sum contract. This could be an increase in the ceiling price of a time-and-
materials contract. In addition, a time adjustment may be appropriate if the UN organization 
caused or could have prevented the delay. 
 
Non-excusable delays 
Non-excusable delays are delays that are not authorized by the UN organization and are, in some 
way, &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;fault. &nbsp;Even &nbsp;delays &nbsp;that &nbsp;may &nbsp;be &nbsp;excusable &nbsp;are &nbsp;deemed &nbsp;non-excusable if the 
supplier could have controlled the effects of the delay in some way and failed to do so. 
 
Remedies 
When the contract is not being performed properly, there are certain remedies that may be 
applied by the procurement officer. These include: 
 
 invoking contract remedies 
 processing/holding payments, as per contract 
 contract termination (for default or convenience). 
 
It is also possible that the situation requires dispute resolution (see below). Any of these actions 
must be approved by the appropriate authority representing each of the parties. 
 
Good practice 
Good practice for choosing the appropriate remedy is to: 
 
 identify the non-conformance 
 consider the cause (negligence from supplier or the UN organization, force majeure, etc.) 
 consider the contract/type of requirement (goods, services or works) 
 consider the context (e.g. sole source, competition, emergency) 
 consider the beneficiary/end-user requirements 
 apply principle of proportionality. 
 
When considering any contract remedy, seeking feedback from the supplier is prudent. As a 
practical business matter, the supplier should be given an opportunity to provide evidence 
against pursuing the remedy. That evidence might point to an excusable delay or impossibility of 
performance. Such evidence can lead to a remedy that is fair and just for both the UN 
organization and the supplier. 
 
When performance problems are the result of supplier deficiencies, the legal terms and 
conditions of the contract provide remedies. Such deficiencies may be related to late delivery or </p>

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-101 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>to other variances from contract requirements. In case of late / delayed delivery an example 
would be to accept the late / delayed delivery and to invoke a Liquidated Damages Clause. 
 
A &nbsp;typical &nbsp;clause &nbsp;in &nbsp;service &nbsp;contracts &nbsp;would &nbsp;be, &nbsp;&ldquo;payment &nbsp;upon &nbsp;completion &nbsp;of &nbsp;certain &nbsp;tasks&rdquo;. &nbsp;
Progress payments would only be made once the task has been completed by the supplier and 
accepted and approved by the UN organization. In case of performance delays (time or quality) 
the UN organization could withhold payment until the performance failure is cured.  
 
Termination is the most serious remedy available to a UN organization. It is the exercise of the 
UN organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;right &nbsp;to &nbsp;completely &nbsp;or &nbsp;partially &nbsp;discontinue &nbsp;contract &nbsp;performance. &nbsp; 
 
 
Dispute management and resolution 
 
The inherent shortcomings of language as a medium of communication, the organizational nature 
of the contracting process, and the dynamic nature of contract relationships all contribute to the 
potential for disagreements between the parties. In fact, disagreements, like changes, are 
virtually inevitable. They are to be expected by all involved and are considered a normal aspect 
of contract management. The larger and more complex the project, the greater is the potential for 
misunderstandings and disagreement. 
 
Contract management planning should include agreement on the procedure to follow to resolve 
disagreement between parties regarding responsibilities and interpretation of the contract.  
Differences of opinion will arise among qualified professionals in the course of execution. 
Claims/requests for changes are part of normal contract execution, and the procedure to review 
and escalate them when necessary should be established from the beginning. There should be an 
agreed procedure for escalating the concern to a higher level of authority. Nonetheless, the 
contract should indicate which party has responsibility for a given decision, and the other party 
should respect that responsibility.  
 
The parties must not allow disagreements and disputes to prevent the execution of the contract. 
They must commit themselves to the amicable resolution of the inevitable disputes that will arise 
between them. Contract claims and disputes cannot be avoided entirely, but they can be resolved 
effectively, fairly, and without rancour and litigation. Experienced parties to a contract will 
anticipate claims and disputes and recognise that they are not necessarily indicative of 
incompetence or ill-will, but merely reflect the fact that human foresight, planning, and 
performance are not perfect. Since it is difficult to avoid the injection of personalities into 
disputes, disputes should be resolved promptly, before they fester and infect the entire 
contractual relationship.  
 
Many contractual disagreements stem from ambiguities in the language of contracts. For this 
purpose, the procurement officer should follow commonly accepted rules developed by judges 
and arbitrators to resolve ambiguities in contract language. These include: 
 
Basic rules 
Some basic rules for resolving ambiguous contract language are: 
 Respect established order of precedence of documents.  
 Apply dictionary definitions to everyday words and a law dictionary for legal terms. 
 Apply standard trade or technical definitions to technical words, unless the context or usage 
</p>
<p>indicates a different meaning. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-102 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p> Define words in accordance with the contract definition. 
 Presume that the same word used in different places means the same thing. 
 Do not interpret or define contract language in such a way as to render it meaningless or to 
</p>
<p>render the rights and obligations of one party unrealistic. 
 Interpret the contract as a whole and, wherever possible, consistently. 
 Where the public interest is affected, apply an interpretation that favours the public. 
 When conflict occurs between two sections of the contract and no directions to the contrary 
</p>
<p>exist, assume that: 
 hand-written text takes precedence over typed text 
 typed text takes precedence over pre-printed  text on a standard form 
 specific clauses take precedence over general clauses. 
</p>
<p> 
Additional rules 
For purposes of resolving ambiguous language, the basic rules apply first. When the basic rules 
fail to provide an answer, the following additional rules apply: 
 The intent of the parties. If the words themselves do not resolve the ambiguity, the 
</p>
<p>procurement officer should find evidence as to the intent of both parties when they entered into 
the contract. For example, evidence might be found in the minutes of the pre-proposal 
conference. If resolution is not evident, consider circumstantial evidence. 
</p>
<p> The circumstances. If evidence cannot be found of the intent of the parties, examine the 
surrounding circumstances. Arbitration proceedings may hold a contracting party to 
interpretations that it held, or at least did not challenge, prior to the dispute. Inconsistencies 
with past interpretations by either the UN organization or the supplier are examined, e.g., a UN 
organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;interpretation of language in the SOW at a kick off meeting with the supplier 
after award will prevail over a later, contradictory, UN organization opinion. Similarly, when 
the UN organization can show that the supplier originally calculated certain work as required 
by the contract and is now trying to claim that the work is extra, the work will be considered as 
part of the basic contract and not additional work. If resolution is not evident, consider risk 
allocation principles. 
</p>
<p> Ambiguous language in a contract is interpreted against the party who drafted it. For example, 
an &nbsp;ambiguity &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;solicitation&rsquo;s &nbsp;SOW, &nbsp;incorporated &nbsp;into &nbsp;the &nbsp;contract, &nbsp;would &nbsp;be &nbsp;interpreted &nbsp;
against &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organization. &nbsp;Likewise, &nbsp;an &nbsp;ambiguity &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;proposed &nbsp;technical &nbsp;
approach, incorporated into the contract, would be interpreted against the supplier. 
</p>
<p> If the ambiguity is obvious, and the non-drafting party does not request clarification before 
contract award, then that party would be viewed as having the last opportunity to correct the 
ambiguity. In which case, the interpretation is against that non-drafting party. 
</p>
<p> 
Keys to effective dispute resolution 
Before escalating a dispute, consider using the following keys to effective dispute resolution: 
 
 recognising that contract documents are not perfect 
 keeping larger objectives in mind 
 focusing on the facts 
 depersonalising the issues 
 being willing to make reasonable compromises.

</p>
<p>Mediation 
Mediation involves the intervention of an impartial third party to solve a contract dispute. 
Although quicker and cheaper than formal arbitration, the UN organization does not usually 
resort to a mediator to solve its contractual disputes. 
 
Escalation process 
Contractual disagreements and disputes can be solved using the following escalation process. 
 
Stage Description 
1 End user and/or requisitioner discuss an amicable solution and implemented it 
</p>
<p>promptly.  
In this stage, the requisitioner and/or end-user are advised to carefully update the 
contract file stating exactly what was discussed and how the dispute was 
resolved. 
</p>
<p>2 Procurement officer reviews the situation and enforces the contractual terms. 
3 Arbitration. 
</p>
<p> 
Note: At each stage in the  escalation process, the procurement officer should contact the 
organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;legal &nbsp;advisor &nbsp;for &nbsp;guidance &nbsp;and &nbsp;approval. 
 
Arbitration 
Arbitration is the last recourse. Arbitration, like court litigation, is time-consuming and costly. In 
arbitration, parties agree to submit their dispute to a panel of persons who will apply the same 
laws that would have been applied by regular courts. However, the arbitrators can use simplified 
procedures, conduct the arbitration in the language of choice of the parties, and need not be 
judges or even lawyers. 
 
No one can ever be entirely sure of its result. It rarely results in a truly satisfactory resolution of 
a dispute, and it sours commercial relationships. For these reasons, it is to be avoided, if possible. 
One of the goals of the responsible UN staff members should be to resolve disputes without 
arbitration whenever possible. 
 
The arbitration process is more formal than ordinary negotiations between the parties (who may 
be represented by attorneys), but it is less formal than court proceedings. The standard arbitration 
clause of UN contracts recognises that efforts will be made to settle disputes through negotiation, 
including mediation or conciliation, which sometimes can be considered as a less formal stage 
before formal arbitration 
 
The United Nations Commission on International Trade Laws (UNCITRAL) has developed an 
internationally accepted arbitration process which is also favoured by the UN organizations.  The 
process can be described as a set of generally accepted principles for international arbitration. 
Many national and international arbitration institutions have declared themselves willing to act 
as appointing authorities under the UNCITRAL arbitration rules. The cost of arbitration is shared 
evenly between each party to the dispute. The location of the arbitration panel is a country that 
can enforce the decision of the arbitration panel. 
 
Each party to the dispute will appoint an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators will then select 
a third panel member. The parties in dispute will then prepare their case and present it to the 
arbitration panel. After careful review of all facts the arbitration panel makes a decision.  
For a UN organization, the decision by the arbitration panel is binding. </p>

</p>
<p>Financial management / payment 
 
Among the rights of the supplier are the right to be paid in a timely matter for efforts completed, 
according to the terms of the contract. Among the obligations of the UN organization are to 
make payment to the supplier on a timely basis and not cause undue cost to the supplier by 
unreasonable management of that financial obligation. While the responsibility for management 
of financial aspects of the contract varies among organizations, it includes: 
 
 Process payments due according to the contract and upon certification of requisitioner if 
</p>
<p>required in the contract.  
 Review financial implications of contract changes, in terms of original costs/outputs and 
</p>
<p>available budget. 
 Liquidate financial securities &ndash; release of bid bonds, performance bonds, advance payment 
</p>
<p>bonds once the reason for requesting them has become moot. 
 
A payment made to a supplier may be one of the following five types: 
 
 advance 
 partial 
 progress 
 final 
 holdback / retention (withholding payment). 
 
Advance payment 
An advance payment is a sum of money paid to the supplier upon signature of the contract, in 
anticipation of identified early expenses. Usually the UN organizations do not undertake advance 
payments. However, sometimes advance payments may be necessary for such things as rent, 
tuition, insurance premiums, and expenses for work performed in particular countries. An 
advance payment needs to be justified and requires special approval before the procurement 
officer can include it in a contract and if it is agreed to, all reasons therefore need to be 
documented. Above certain thresholds, suppliers receiving advance payments must provide 
guarantees, e.g. bank guarantees. 
 
Partial payment 
A partial payment is based on the acceptance of a particular product or service. To process a 
partial &nbsp;payment, &nbsp;a &nbsp;document &nbsp;must &nbsp;be &nbsp;on &nbsp;file &nbsp;that &nbsp;confirms &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN&rsquo;s &nbsp;acceptance. &nbsp;This &nbsp;
confirmation usually is in the form of an invoice or delivery ticket detailing the goods or services 
and signed by a UN staff member authorized to accept the product or service. 
 
Progress payment 
A progress payment, also referred to as an instalment payment, is a form of contract financing 
made before final work or deliverables are accepted. The UN organization uses this form of 
payment for long-term service work that involves an end item, such as a report. If progress 
payments are authorized, they should normally be tied to a milestone in contract performance, 
such &nbsp;as &nbsp;the &nbsp;delivery &nbsp;and &nbsp;acceptance &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;draft &nbsp;report &nbsp;for &nbsp;a &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;approval &nbsp;or &nbsp;delivery &nbsp;
of an outline of initial findings for review by the UN organization. Service work for which the 
service itself is the deliverable (for example, courier service, cleaning services, and so on) would 
not need progress payments but would use partial payments for services rendered during the 
billing period.

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-105 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Final payment 
A final payment is a payment made in acknowledgement / approval of the completion of all 
contract &nbsp;performance. &nbsp;The &nbsp;payment &nbsp;office &nbsp;may &nbsp;make &nbsp;payment &nbsp;based &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;invoice &nbsp;
and its receipt of a receiving report or delivery docket from another UN office. For on-site 
services at their own office, requisitioners may play a more active role. 
 
Holdback 
Holdback payments are used in works and complex consulting assignments to ensure completion 
of the contract and in some construction contracts to ensure that the general supplier has paid its 
subontractors. The holdback payments are retained by the UN organization until the supplier has 
provided proof it has discharged itself of all its obligations under the contract. This contract 
provision allows the UN organization to withhold a portion of payment, usually 10 to 15% of 
each invoice sent by the supplier.  
 
 
Contract completion and close out 
 
Contract close out activities are generally fairly straightforward, especially for small dollar value 
contracts and purchase orders. However, in complex and high dollar value contracts involving 
progress payments and/or securities, the procurement officer ensures that the contract file is 
properly closed out. Each of the required activities to complete and close out a contract are 
described below. 
 
The close out process ensures that all contractual obligations have been met, and that residual 
obligations &ndash; such as warranties, guarantees and after-sales service and support &ndash; are clearly 
defined in terms of responsibility, liability, procedures and timeframes. Contract close-out occurs 
once all contractual obligations have been fulfilled by the supplier. It includes the following key 
steps:  
 
Step Action 
1 Review and confirm appropriate action taken according to contract close-out 
</p>
<p>checklists. 
2 Prepare final contract performance report (jointly by requisitioner and procurement 
</p>
<p>officer), including lessons learned.  
Depending on the organization, this report may be purely internal or may be shared 
with the supplier for their knowledge and comment. 
</p>
<p>3 Prepare supplier assessment form and forward for appropriate action. 
4 Issue &nbsp;final &nbsp;acceptance &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;basis &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;requisitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;report. 
5 Make final financial settlements. 
6 Liquidate/return bonds and/or securities. 
7 Record any residual obligations (warranties, etc.) and advise requisitioner of 
</p>
<p>procedures. 
8 Close out contract file. 
</p>
<p> 
UN organization supplied equipment and material 
Prior to closing a contract, assets provided to the supplier by the UN organization during the 
contract must be returned to the UN organization. A report confirming receipt of this material 
and equipment should be prpared and placed on the contract file. 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 3: Procurement Process  Page 3-106 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Unused furnished material provided by the UN organization must also be returned by the 
supplier. A report is prepared by the supplier detailing the amount of material consumed during 
contract execution and the quantity and quality of the material returned to the UN organization. 
A copy of the report should be placed on the contract file. 
 
Warranty performance 
Warranties must be spelled out in the specific terms and conditions of the contract or in the UN 
organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;standard &nbsp;contract &nbsp;terms &nbsp;and &nbsp;conditions. &nbsp;Warranties &nbsp;offer &nbsp;buyers &nbsp;remedies &nbsp;when &nbsp;
defects are discovered after products and services have been accepted. The administration of 
warranties is primarily the responsibility of the requisitioners or end-users. Because end-users 
often are the first to identify defects in products that are covered under warranty, it is essential 
that they are familiar with any required procedures. 
 
Commercial warranties provided by manufacturers and services contain strict notification 
procedures that the UN organization must follow. If these procedures are not followed, the 
supplier is not obliged to honour the warranty terms. Consequently, the UN organization should 
put in place general steps to follow when problems with accepted items arise. Normally, the 
advice &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;legal &nbsp;advisor &nbsp;may &nbsp;be &nbsp;required. 
 
When problems with accepted items occur, and before the supplier is notified, the end-user or 
requisitioner should: 
 
 identify &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN&rsquo;s &nbsp;specific &nbsp;rights &nbsp;under &nbsp;the &nbsp;warranty 
 verify that the defect is covered under the warranty and that it applies in the specific incident of 
</p>
<p>failure, by answering these questions: 
 Has the UN organization officially accepted the product or service? 
 When does the warranty expire, and what does it cover? 
 Does the UN organization have any obligations under the warranty, and have those 
</p>
<p>obligations been met? 
 Do the facts support invoking the warranty? 
</p>
<p> 
With the information gathered, the UN organization can notify the supplier and do the following: 
 
 obtain &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;position &nbsp;and &nbsp;its &nbsp;reasons &nbsp;for &nbsp;taking &nbsp;that &nbsp;position 
 reach agreement on how and when the warranty will be applied 
 document the notification. 
 
Regardless of when the defect was discovered, there will be less room for argument if UN staff 
members notify the supplier before the warranty period expires. 
 
Liquidation of securities 
Performance bonds, holdback payments and guarantees must be returned to their owners once 
the supplier has fulfilled its contractual obligations. Securities must be liquidated at the time and 
in the manner described in the contract. In the case of works and capital equipment, the securities 
are typically held and kept safe by the finance department until they have expired. 
 
Supplier performance report 
In addition to the remedies, procurement officers document deficiencies on a supplier 
performance report. Such reports are to be prepared by the requisitioner or the contract manager 
and then sent to the appropriate procurement officer. Supplier performance reports alert the UN </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>organization to patterns in performance problems and identify suppliers who might present high 
performance risks. The procurement officer may seek appropriate management review and 
action when the supplier performance report is particularly negative, according to the policies 
and procedures of the individual organization. Supplier performance reports are completed by 
the requisitioners/end-users. They are used to document satisfactory performance of suppliers 
and document the poor performance of the suppliers to eventually eliminate them from the 
organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;supplier &nbsp;roster. &nbsp;Once &nbsp;completed, &nbsp;a &nbsp;copy &nbsp;should &nbsp;be &nbsp;kept &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;contract &nbsp;file &nbsp;and &nbsp;on &nbsp;
the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;file &nbsp;(see &nbsp;Unit &nbsp;3.3 &nbsp;Sourcing &nbsp;for &nbsp;further &nbsp;details). 
 
Claims 
A claim is a request from either party for entitlement under the contract that is not being 
fulfilled. Claims might result from: 
 
 unforeseen costs 
 disputes over the interpretation of contract clauses 
 disputes over what is included within the contract price 
 breaches of contract. 
 
Any claim (whether issued by the UN organization or the supplier) should include: 
 
 full explanation of the problem as well as the causes of the problem 
 the contract clause under which the claim is being submitted. 
 
Claims should only be considered from suppliers that are contracted directly by the UN 
organization. &nbsp;Those &nbsp;submitted &nbsp;by &nbsp;a &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;sub-contractor should be rejected since there is no 
contract between the sub-contractor and the UN organization. The supplier may however wish to 
make a claim against the UN organization on the basis of a claim made against it by its sub-
contractor. Contracts can not be closed out until all claims are settled. 
 
Lessons learned 
The requisitioner and the procurement officer may be expected to complete a lessons learned 
report. This is good practice and allows the organization to gather and use information to 
improve chances of success of future procurement actions. It covers as a minimum the following 
questions and topics: 
 
 Was the requirement adequately defined? 
 Were the evaluation criteria appropriate? 
 Was the evaluation method appropriate? 
 What kinds of suggestions were brought up by suppliers? 
 What problems were encountered? 
 Recommendations to avoid similar situations.

</p>
<p>4.1 Risk Management 
 
Risk is exposure to loss as a consequence of uncertainty. There are a variety of risks faced during 
the procurement process. There are global risks and risks in every phase and stage of the process, 
with certain risks of greater importance during each stage. Understanding the main categories of 
risk faced in the procurement process assists in risk assessment and planning practical 
management and operational measures that should be taken to mitigate those risks. 
 
 
Risk analysis and management 
 
The impact of risk can be measured by the likelihood of an unwanted event occurring and the 
consequences if it does occur. For planning purposes, the impact of risk could be the same for 
both small damage resulting from a highly probable recurring event and very large damage 
resulting from a rare event. But the two situations would be managed in different ways. For 
example, the highly probable event could perhaps be made less frequent through improved 
procedures and professional practice, whereas insuring (or self-insuring) for the damage of the 
rare event could be a practical alternative if it can be combined with a class of similar risks. 
 
Risk analysis 
Risk analysis is a planning stage which seeks to identify the origin, probability and magnitude of 
the risks. It helps direct attention to which risks warrant close attention and have the greatest 
potential for reducing exposure. There are distinct risks at each stage of the procurement process. 
Risk analysis should form part of each stage of procurement planning and be regularly updated. 
 
Risk management 
Risk management seeks to mitigate the impact of the risk by reducing the likelihood of its 
occurrence and/or reducing avoidable consequences through planning, monitoring and other 
appropriate actions. Whether in general or in the specific case, procurement officers should 
identify and analyse all risk factors that are likely to occur on a project, and then decide on the 
most appropriate management response for each risk/combination of risks.  Responses may 
include: 
 
 ignore 
 reduce 
 transfer 
 manage, and 
 decide which party is most appropriate to manage each of the risks identified.  
 
Neither in the business world nor the public sector can risk be avoided entirely, rather it is part of 
the normal work environment within which we operate. It can to some extent be managed. Some 
measures to manage risk are based on the quality of the procurement process applied across all 
activities, while other measures may be targeted to specific risks inherent in certain categories of 
procurement. 
 
A useful tool to analyse risk and focus management attention is the risk analysis and 
management matrix. During procurement planning, activities are placed on a risk continuum 
from &nbsp;&ldquo;low&rdquo; &nbsp;to &nbsp;&ldquo;high&rdquo; &nbsp;and &nbsp;an &nbsp;impact &nbsp;continuum &nbsp;from &nbsp;&ldquo;low&rdquo; &nbsp;to &nbsp;&ldquo;high&rdquo; &nbsp;as &nbsp;shown &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;figure &nbsp;
below.  </p>

Benefits of risk management 
The benefits of effective risk management include:  
 
 Greater confidence of right supply at right time, to further specific activity goal 
 better control of uncertainty 
 reduced impact of risk 
 improved decision making 
 realistic estimates less likely to be exceeded 
 stronger team communication 
 lower probability of damage to the image of the organization. 
 
In managing risk, it is important to understand the extent to which a party has control over the 
risk and the ability to do something about it. Responsibility for risk should be allocated 
according to the ability each party has to manage the risk. Efforts to make a party responsible for 
risks over which it has no control are likely to lead to dispute and additional costs in time or 
money. &nbsp;In &nbsp;fact, &nbsp;such &nbsp;&ldquo;risk &nbsp;avoidance&rdquo; &nbsp;leaves &nbsp;the &nbsp;risk &nbsp;in &nbsp;place, &nbsp;when &nbsp;it &nbsp;is &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;interest &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;
organization that it be managed.  
 
Sources of risks 
Risks to successful procurement can come from several types of sources, namely: 
 external factors 
 project complexity 
 project planning 
 procurement process  
 fraud, corruption and unprofessional conduct. 
 
External factors can include political, economic, and even nature. Among the more frequent 
external factors are the UN organization and partner government decision making processes that 
are used to approve activities and their budgets. While political and budgetary factors are 
generally outside the control of the procurement officer, to reduce the risk of late supply, it is

<p>appropriate to begin the procurement process with sufficient lead time, and include appropriate 
caveats to potential suppliers when a solicitation is issued in advance of authorisation, ensuring 
that it will not lead to binding commitments until and if such authorisation is received.  
 
Project complexity may lead to objective difficulty in specifying requirements, either because 
conditions are not fully known or the requirement is subject to change for political or other 
reasons. Risks can be reduced by early involvement of procurement officers in the project team, 
and by regularly reviewing the requirement. In some cases, such as major civil works, this may 
call for appropriate contractual arrangements that recognise the specific uncertainties involved. 
 
Where project planning not properly carried out, this can contribute to each of the negative 
outcomes referred above, as well as to friction in relations among colleagues. The risks can be 
best reduced through early involvement of procurement officers in planning respective activities 
to ensure that requirements for and of procurement are properly integrated. 
 
The procurement process contains in each of its stages, multiple specific risks and consequences. 
Managing these risks is part of the professional responsibility of each procurement officer.   
 
Fraud, corruption and unprofessional conduct can enter into any stage of the procurement 
process, producing the risk of loss of organizational resources and budget for inappropriate 
supply, with corresponding great damage to the image of the organization. Key among the 
measures to mitigate these risks are:  
 
 transparent process 
 competition 
 separation of functions 
 clear rules and procedures 
 standard documents 
 professional training of staff 
 effective control systems 
 accountability.  
 
Competition, transparency and separation of functions are the foundation of risk mitigation, 
since they ensure any fraudulent or corrupt behaviour will not go unnoticed. These need to be 
linked to senior management that does not tolerate such behaviour, provides training, systems, 
authority and controls so staff may carry out the procurement function correctly (see Unit 4.4 
Ethics). 
 
All those involved &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;process &nbsp;should &nbsp;consider &nbsp;themselves, &nbsp;&ldquo;risk &nbsp;managers&rdquo; &nbsp;and &nbsp;
be aware of the potential risks at each stage in the procurement cycle in both planning and 
undertaking their activities. 
 
 
Risk and risk management in the procurement process 
 
There are risks in each phase of the procurement process, and there are organizational and 
commercial measures that can be taken to mitigate those risks. Examples of typical risks, 
possible consequences and what to do at each stage are listed in the tables below:

<p>4.2 E-Procurement 
 
Introduction 
 
In its broadest sense, e-procurement involves electronic data transfers to support operational, 
tactical and strategic procurement. E-procurement has therefore been around for much longer 
than the term itself which first came into usage after the establishment of the internet in the 
1990s. From the 1960s until the mid 1990s, e-procurement primarily took the form of electronic 
data interchange (EDI). Nowadays, e-procurement is often supported by internet technologies 
and is becoming more prevalent. The historic context is demonstrated in the chart below: 
 
</p>
<p> 
 
Those involved in the procurement function need to understand the e-procurement concepts and 
tools to provide input into their development, use, evaluation and refinement as a means of 
improving procurement efficiency and effectiveness. 
 
Procurement officers and managers can make a contribution to decisions about investments in, 
and configuration and use of e-procurement tools by: 
 
 having a general understanding of the various e-procurement applications 
 identifying the procurement processes that are effectively supported by e-procurement 
 understanding the sources of benefit of e-procurement 
 identifying the risks associated with the adoption of e-procurement 
 contributing to the development of e-procurement tools through identifying scope for e-
</p>
<p>commerce supported process improvement.

<p>E-procurement tools and applications 
 
Some e-procurement tools and applications include: 
 
 electronic systems to support traditional procurement 
 EDI (electronic data interchange) 
 ERP systems 
 internet as a support or complement to traditional procurement 
 electronic mail (e-mail) 
 web enabled EDI 
 extensible markup language (XML) 
 world wide web (www) 
 internet tools and platforms that replace traditional procurement 
 
Electronic systems to support traditional procurement 
These include mainframes and personal computers (PC), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). 
 
EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) 
EDI is an application whereby electronic messages can be exchanged between computer 
programs of two separate organizations.  Some features of EDI include: 
 
 Messages are exchanged in groups, known as batches. 
 Messages can automatically be sent, transmitted and stored between computers without 
</p>
<p>retyping or keying data. 
 EDI has to be implemented by each pair of organizations (sender and receiver) who wish to use 
</p>
<p>it. This means that the implementation costs of EDI are relatively high. 
 EDI is mostly used where the messages exchanged concern such matters as orders, 
</p>
<p>confirmations, transport information and invoicing. 
 EDI traditionally runs on so-called, &nbsp;&ldquo;Value &nbsp;Added &nbsp;Networks&rdquo;, &nbsp;which &nbsp;are &nbsp;closed &nbsp;networks &nbsp;
</p>
<p>(unlike open networks like the Internet). 
 
ERP systems 
ERP systems are management information systems that integrate and automate many of the 
business practices associated with the operations of a company or organization. ERP systems 
typically handle the manufacturing, logistics, distribution, inventory, shipping, invoicing, and 
accounting for a company or organization. ERPs aid in the control of many business activities, 
like sales, delivery, billing, production, procurement, inventory management, and human 
resources management. 
 
Internet as a support or complement to traditional procurement 
There are various types of internet based applications that serve different purposes. Some well-
known applications that use the internet are described below: 
 
Electronic mail (e-mail) 
Email is an Internet based application through which electronic messages are exchanged between 
people.

<p>Web enabled EDI 
web enabled Edi is like traditional EDI (see above), but run on the Internet; also known as EDI-
INT. 
 
Extensible Markup Language (XML) 
XML is used to allow for the easy interchange of documents on the World Wide Web. 
 
World Wide Web (WWW) 
The WWW is a major service on the Internet. The World Wide Web is made up of "Web 
servers" that store and disseminate "Web pages," which are "rich" documents that contain text, 
graphics, animations and videos to anyone with an Internet connection. 
 
The figure below illustrates the categories of electronic communication exchange between 
people and computers.

Internet tools and platforms that replace traditional procurement 
Some internet tools and platforms that replace traditional procurement include: 
 
 E-sourcing 
 E-tendering 
 E- auctioning 
 E-ordering and web-based ERP 
 E-information 
 
E-sourcing  
E-sourcing supports the specification phase; it can be used to pre-qualify suppliers and also 
identifies suppliers that can be used in the selection phase. For suppliers the benefit is: 
&ldquo;marketing&rdquo; &nbsp;and &nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;buying &nbsp;organizations &nbsp;the &nbsp;benefit &nbsp;is &nbsp;facilitating &nbsp;the &nbsp;sourcing &nbsp;of &nbsp;suppliers. &nbsp;
The UN Global Market Place (UNGM www.ungm.org) is an example of an E-sourcing tool.

</p>
<p>E-tendering  
E-tendering supports the selection stage and acts as a communication platform between the 
procuring organization and suppliers. It covers the complete tendering process from REOI via 
ITB/RFP to contracting, usually including support for the analysis and assessment activities; it 
does not include closing the deal with a supplier but facilitates a large part of the tactical 
procurement process. It results in equal treatment of suppliers; transparent selection process; 
reduction in (legal) errors; clear audit trial; more efficiency in the tactical procurement process 
and improved time management of tendering procedures. Some UN organizations such as 
UNDP-IAPSO and UNHCR have used E-tendering in the formulation of long-term agreements 
for vehicles, tents, motorcycles and pharmaceuticals through an in-house developed tendering 
portal. 
 
E-auctioning  
E-auctioning supports the contract stage. It enables the closing of a deal with a supplier if parties 
agree on price. They operate with an upward or downward price mechanism e.g. e-auctioning 
with upward price mechanism for the selling organization and e-reverse auctioning with a 
downward price mechanism for the buying organization. They can be made in accordance with 
traditional ITB/RFP. They are internet based using open or closed systems. 
 
E-ordering and web-based ERP  
E-ordering and web-based ERP is the process of creating and approving procurement 
requisitions, placing purchase orders, as well as receiving goods and services ordered, by using 
software systems based on the Internet. 
 
System Usually &nbsp;used&hellip; 
E-ordering  For indirect (facility) goods and services. 
</p>
<p> By all employees of an organization. 
 For ad-hoc ordering. 
</p>
<p>Web-based ERP  For direct (product related) goods and services. 
 By a procurement department. 
 For planned ordering. 
</p>
<p> 
E-informing  
E-informing is not directly associated with a stage in the procurement process; it is the process of 
gathering and distributing procurement information both from and to internal and external parties 
using Internet technology.

<p>E-procurement in the procurement cycle 
 
The figure below shows the six forms of e-procurement plotted in the procurement process 
</p>
<p> 
 
Each of these forms can be explained as follows: 
 
 E-sourcing supports the specification phase; it identifies suppliers that can be used in the 
</p>
<p>selection phase. 
 E-tendering supports the selection phase; it facilitates the REOI and ITB/RFP activities, 
</p>
<p>usually including support for the analysis and assessment activities. 
 E-reverse auctioning supports the contract phase; it enables closing a deal with a supplier; 
 E-ordering and web-based ERP is the process of creating and approving procurement 
</p>
<p>requisitions, placing purchase orders, as well as receiving goods and services ordered, by using 
a software system based on the Internet. 
</p>
<p> E-informing is not directly associated with a phase in the procurement process; it is the process 
of gathering and distributing procurement information both from and to internal and external 
parties using Internet technology.  
</p>
<p> 
 
E-procurement strategy &ndash; costs, benefits and risks 
 
Business cases aimed at adopting or enhancing e-procurement tools are often prepared by 
information technology and/or finance specialists. However, some of the most successful e-
procurement implementations have been driven by those who best understand the procurement 
processes and outcomes to be achieved. Because of their understanding and proximity to 
procurement processes, those involved in the procurement function have a key role to play in 
identifying and assessing the costs and benefits of e-procurement tools and in providing input 
into how existing tools may be enhanced.  
 
The following costs and benefits as identified by de Boer, Harink et al. (2002), can be influenced 
by e-procurement: 
 
 The cost of expenditure on goods/services related directly to the production/service delivery.

</p>
<p> The cost of non-production of goods and services. 
 The cost of operational procurement activities &ndash; e.g., requisitioning, ordering, expediting and 
</p>
<p>administrative support. 
 The cost of tactical procurement activities &ndash; e.g., formulating specifications, selecting 
</p>
<p>suppliers, negotiating with suppliers, contracting, disposals etc. 
 The costs of strategic procurement activities &ndash; e.g., spend analysis, transaction analysis, market 
</p>
<p>analysis, planning, developing procurement policies etc. 
 Internal benefits arising from investments in particular inter-organizational relationships. 
 The contribution of investments in particular inter-organizational relationships to revenues. 
 
These costs and benefits should be assessed in relation to each e-procurement tool. While it is 
usually assumed that e-procurement will automatically deliver benefits, the actual benefits will 
depend on many factors including: cost of required investment, ability to convert associated 
savings to cash, nature of the procurement process being automated, particular supply market 
and the extent to which the organization supports its implementation. 
 
Benefits 
Particular benefits of e-procurement in the public sector are thought to include greater 
transparency in procurement through electronic publishing of tender notices and contract awards. 
This in turn is likely to enhance accountability and reduce the instances of corruption. 
 
When developing a business case for adopting or enhancing an e-procurement tool, it is 
important to assess the baseline benefits and costs associated with the process or processes to be 
automated in order to understand the probable outcomes of e-procurement adoption or 
enhancement. In essence, it is important to understand what will change and how it will change 
when an e-procurement tool is implemented. 
 
Risks 
The implementation of e-procurement tools carries certain risks. One of the primary risks is 
missing opportunities to implement strategies that improve procurement management without 
the need for investment in e-procurement. This is because many of the benefits ascribed to e-
procurement may be achieved simply by improving procurement practice. For example, it is 
often said that e-procurement reduces &nbsp;&ldquo;maverick &nbsp;buying&rdquo;. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;other &nbsp;measures, &nbsp;including &nbsp;
the implementation of corporate buying strategies that offer value for money, do not need 
electronic tools. 
 
Another risk is over-investment in e-procurement tools that do not deliver the expected benefits. 
This risk arises when there has been inadequate evaluation of the implications of the adoption or 
enhancement of e-procurement tools. The risk that users will not accept an e-procurement tool is 
another common risk. This risk often arises where users have not been adequately consulted 
about the adoption or enhancement of particular tools. 
 
On the supply side, there is a risk that suppliers will not cooperate with the use of e-procurement 
tools. For example, some suppliers are sufficiently powerful to insist on the use of paper-based 
systems. Others may not have access to affordable internet based technology that would give 
them access to the e-procurement tools of purchasers. In markets that are already competitive 
with low profit margins, suppliers may choose not to participate in e-reverse auctions.

</p>
<p>Normal methods of risk assessment and management (see Unit 4.1 Risk Management) should be 
applied during the development of business cases for e-procurement development or 
enhancement. 
 
Legal aspects of e-procurement 
 
The accepted legal framework guiding e-procurement is the UNCITRAL Model Law on 
Electronic Commerce which states: 
 
&ldquo;In &nbsp;the &nbsp;context &nbsp;of &nbsp;contract &nbsp;formation, &nbsp;unless &nbsp;otherwise &nbsp;agreed &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;parties, &nbsp;an &nbsp;offer &nbsp;and &nbsp;
the acceptance of an offer may be &nbsp;expressed &nbsp;by &nbsp;means &nbsp;of &nbsp;data &nbsp;messages.&rdquo; 
 
&ldquo;Where &nbsp;a &nbsp;data &nbsp;message &nbsp;is &nbsp;used &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;formation &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;contract, &nbsp;that &nbsp;contract &nbsp;should &nbsp;not &nbsp;be &nbsp;
denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that a data message was used for that 
purpose.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> 
Good practice in the UN system adopts this approach, for example, the UN revised FRR take 
into account the feasibility of electronic contracting. As per UN Financial Rule 105.18 (b) which 
states: 
  
&ldquo;The &nbsp;requirement &nbsp;for &nbsp;written &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;contracts &nbsp;shall &nbsp;not &nbsp;be &nbsp;interpreted &nbsp;to &nbsp;restrict the 
use of any electronic means of data interchange. Before any electronic means of data 
interchange is used, the Under-Secretary General for Management shall ensure that the 
electronic data interchange system is capable of ensuring authentication and confidentiality 
of &nbsp;the &nbsp;information&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>  
In the UN Secretariat, this authority has been delegated to the UN controller, who determines 
whether in a particular case, electronic contracting may be possible, for example by an electronic 
exchange of information without the need to issue a traditional purchase order. Electronic 
contracting may only be agreed with a supplier in specific cases where prior written 
authorisation has been obtained. 
 
In adopting or adapting any e-procurement systems, the practical issues around these legal 
aspects need to be taken into consideration during the planning and implementation stages.

<p>4.3 Logistics  
 
Introduction 
 
Logistics is defined as the process of planning, implementing and controlling the efficient and 
cost-effective flow and storage of raw materials, goods, equipment and personnel from the point 
of origin until the completion of an activity, in accordance with end-user&rsquo;s &nbsp;requirements. &nbsp; 
 
In its broadest sense, logistics includes all the elements that constitute a delivery infrastructure, 
however, in this context, focus will be on the aspects of logistics that are relevant to the 
procurement process. This Unit provides only a brief summary of logistics seen from a 
procurement perspective. Specialists in logistics will have a more advanced approach, and some 
UN organizations treat logistics as a separate field of expertise. Further, some UN organizations 
use warehouses as a strategic tool in supply chain management. Management of warehouses is 
not included in this Unit. 
 
 
Logistics planning process 
 
Proper logistics planning entails considering logistical aspects throughout the various stages of 
the procurement process. It contributes to efficient procurement processes, and reduces the risk 
of incurring problems that may lead to additional costs and delay.  
 
Logistics planning starts at the needs assessment phase of procurement by considering the 
desired result of the requisitioner and the end-user and from there working backwards to 
determine what will lead to a successful completion of the activity. Ideally this process should 
begin even before the requisition is placed, through close cooperation and efficient 
communication between the operational unit requesting the purchase and procurement officers.  
 
The aspects of logistics planning that should be considered during the various stages of the 
procurement process (planning, requirement definition, sourcing, and evaluation) are detailed 
below: 
 
1) Understanding the operational context of the required product, and, if possible, assist in 
</p>
<p>developing specifications suitable to local conditions. 
 
</p>
<p>2) Evaluating the procurement activity and the time and financial resources available in order to 
determine urgency of the requirement. Urgency may determine location of the purchase and 
thereby also the mode of transport. 
 
</p>
<p>3) Determining the type of sourcing.  
 
</p>
<p>Goods may be purchased locally/regionally or internationally, or through established LTAs. 
However, in some organizations, goods may also already be available in a warehouse, as 
surplus stock from another project, or in pipeline already purchased for another purpose, but 
available for diversion in order to cover a more urgent need. Goods may even be borrowed 
from a sister organization, or be available as a donation in kind.  
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 4: Transverse Procurement Themes  Page 4-19 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Goods may also have been pre-positioned as part of an emergency stockpile policy, either 
globally, regionally or on a local level. 
 
These options should be considered when determining whether to purchase, and how and 
where to purchase, the required product, in order to meet end-user&rsquo;s &nbsp;needs &nbsp;in &nbsp;a &nbsp;timely &nbsp;and &nbsp;
cost efficient manner. 
 
</p>
<p>4) Determining which markets are best positioned to respond to the end-user&rsquo;s &nbsp;delivery &nbsp;
requirements by evaluating total delivered costs as well as lead times, in addition to 
conformity with technical criteria, for example, tractors from one region are not necessarily 
the most suitable for another region, even though they may be very competitive and 
reasonably priced.  
</p>
<p> 
There is usually a trade off between the purchase price of a product and their transport costs 
and delivery lead-time. The relative importance of these factors will determine where the 
goods are purchased and how they are transported. It should be noted that geographic 
distance does not necessarily determine the cost and delivery time. Trade lanes and feeder 
vessels will have an impact. 
 
Accepting a more expensive offer in order to conform to the requested delivery date should 
be carefully assessed and discussed with the requisitioner and end-user in order to ensure the 
most effective use of funds. When the delivery date is the primary factor in awarding a 
contract, it should be clearly stated in the solicitation document. In such a case, any offer not 
in compliance with the requested delivery schedule must be rejected. 
</p>
<p> 
5)  Reviewing the delivery and transport requirements, as well as the budget, and ensuring that 
</p>
<p>they are complete and realistic.  
 
</p>
<p>The cost of transportation is a significant component in the cost of goods procured and 
delivered to the designated site. Procurement officers should therefore ensure proper logistics 
planning in making every effort to keep the transportation costs down. However, in logistics 
planning, the cheapest alternative may not always be the one that offers the lowest overall 
cost. A low-cost, but poor delivery strategy may result in delays, damaged or stolen goods, 
excessive port charges, etc. All factors should therefore be assessed when choosing the 
appropriate logistical solution. 
</p>
<p> 
6) Determining and comparing total lead time, including logistics activities. Different logistics 
</p>
<p>corridors incur different costs, but also have an impact on total lead times. One route may, 
for example, be cheaper but experiences many difficulties and delays in clearing transit 
goods. An alternate route may cut transport time. In some source countries, for example, 
export processing may take longer, or ports may experience much congestion. Total supply 
chain lead times should be taken into account. 
</p>
<p> 
7) Determining the most cost effective means of contracting transport, i.e. from the supplier 
</p>
<p>included in the purchase order, or contracted to independent freight forwarder. Some 
organizations also allow transportation with their own resources (e.g. transportation of goods 
in project vehicles by project personnel). 
</p>
<p> 
8) Tendering for freight services, if determined under aspect number 6 listed above, and 
</p>
<p>checking availability and competitiveness of an LTA for freight services. For large </p>

</p>
<p>consignments where more favourable rates can possibly be obtained, spot tenders are 
advisable. 
</p>
<p> 
9) Insuring &nbsp;a &nbsp;consignment &nbsp;in &nbsp;accordance &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;policy &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization &nbsp;(see &nbsp;&lsquo;insurance &nbsp;
</p>
<p>during &nbsp;transportation&rsquo; &nbsp;below). 
 
10) Ensuring that shipping documents received from the supplier and freight forwarder are 
</p>
<p>complete and accurate and that the consignee &nbsp;has &nbsp;received &nbsp;their &nbsp;set &nbsp;(see &nbsp;&lsquo;shipping &nbsp;
documents&rsquo; &nbsp;below). 
</p>
<p> 
11) Ensuring that necessary arrangements are in place to clear cargo on arrival. Depending upon 
</p>
<p>the procedures in the country, the consignee could be responsible for custom clearance of the 
goods, however, customs clearance is part of the procurement procedure, and thus the 
responsibility of procurement officers. 
</p>
<p> 
Arrange for acceptance of goods on arrival by the receiving unit and ensure that claims are 
initiated within the time frame stipulated in the cargo insurance to secure the interests of the 
organization in the case of missing or damaged cargo. 
</p>
<p> 
12) Obtaining acknowledgement from consignee that the shipment has been received in good 
</p>
<p>order. 
 
</p>
<p>Throughout this process, the requisitioner and/or end-user should be kept informed of 
expected and actual delivery dates in order for them to account for it in their local planning. 
</p>
<p> 
 
Logistics requirements for goods 
 
The following logistical requirements should be considered for the shipment of goods: 
 
 packing and containerization 
 packing &amp; shipping instructions 
 labelling and shipping marks 
 modes of transportation 
 forwarding agents 
 Incoterms 
 insurance during transportation 
 shipping documents 
 receipt of consignment. 
 
Packing  
The nature of the goods together with the mode of shipment and the climatic conditions during 
transit and at the destination, determine the required packaging. 
 
The durability, size and weight of the packages should be considered in relation to the planned 
means of transportation. It should be ensured that the equipment, warehouse facilities, operators 
and labourers involved in the shipment of the goods have the capacity to handle the goods in the 
chosen packaging. For instance, some port facilities can only handle 20ft containers so 40ft 
containers should not be used. Further, axle weight road restrictions should be considered for 
certain road shipments and maximum vessel draught allowed for shallow ports, etc. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 4: Transverse Procurement Themes  Page 4-21 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Climatic conditions both at the end destination, but also in transit, should be considered to ensure 
the packaging can withstand heat, cold, rain, humidity, mould, dust, salt water spray, etc., if 
required. Certain types of goods require a constant temperature and air shipment, cold chain 
equipment and temperature monitoring. 
 
To be on the safe side, always assume that shipments will be handled roughly and loaded and 
offloaded numerous times before reaching the final destination.  
 
Containerization 
Unless the goods are shipped in 20 foot/40 foot containers (see the table below), the organization 
should specify that it should be shipped below deck in order to avoid damages during transport 
(e.g. risks of rust, humidity, etc.). 
 
Containerization could be considered for extra protection and to handle the shipment more 
effectively, however, this may increase cost. If containers are used, it is recommended to try to 
make full use of space and ship only full containers in order to save costs, as the rate for 
shipment usually does not depend on weight. The use of LCL (less than container load) 
containers that consolidates consignments from different clients, will expose the shipment to the 
risks of abuse and delays if one or several consignments should experience difficulties in 
clearing customs. Further, small consignments risk hanging around for weeks in order to make 
up a full container load. It is therefore recommended, where possible, to plan loads that fill the 
container. 
 
It should be noted that containerization will not reduce the need for appropriate packing, as part 
of the journey usually takes place outside of the container. 
 
Containers have the following approximate size, volume and payload (note sizes can vary 
slightly depending on the manufacturer). 
 
Dimensions 20 ft container 40 ft container 
Inner length 5.90 m 12.02 m 
Inner width 2.33 m 2.33 m

Door height 2.14 m 2.21 m 
   
Payload (approx.) 18-19.5 metric tons 28 metric tons 
</p>
<p> 
There are different types of containers, which can be used depending on the size and type of 
products to be shipped as described in the table below: 
 
Container type Features 
Dry  Most common type of container. 
Open top  No hard top. 
Flat racks  No top and no sides.

</p>
<p>Packing and shipping instructions  
Standard packing and shipping instructions are documents specifying how the goods are to be 
packed and shipped, and who to notify upon shipment. They list all the documents required for 
customs clearance and for payment purposes.  
 
Packing and shipping instructions should form part of all purchase orders as an annex.  
 
The packing and shipping instructions are linked to the Incoterms used. Procurement officers 
should refer to the standard documents available in the organization. 
 
Labelling and shipping marks 
To facilitate the identification of goods and handling whilst in transit, suppliers should be 
instructed to provide clear and complete labelling and shipping marks on all packages. The 
labelling and shipping marks should include: 
 
 consignee 
 destination 
 port of unloading 
 project identification 
 order number 
 case number. 
 
Contents of the packages should not be included to discourage theft and pilferage. 
 
Modes of transport 
Four basic modes of freight transportation are used, either individually or in combination: sea, 
rail, road, and air.  
 
Procurement officers should consider both economy and efficiency when choosing the mode of 
transport. In general, rail, road and air transport costs are comparatively higher than freight by 
sea, thus in general sea transport is recommended. Maritime freight typically counts for 15-20 
percent of the costs of the goods, and airfreight may represent up to 100 percent. International 
shipments by sea average three to five weeks (but can be considerably longer), while air 
shipments usually take less then a week. The balance of operational parameters such as time and 
financial resources should determine the mode of transportation.  
 
Procurement officers should prioritize transport preferences in accordance with the following 
criteria: 
 
1) The cheapest means of transport that meets delivery requirements. 
2) Scheduling through the fewest number of trans-shipment points. 
3) Shipping via preferred trans-shipment points and customs. 
4) Using dedicated freight forwarders wherever possible. 
5) Applying a 1:4 ratio rule for air shipment (ship by air if less than 25 percent of cost of 
</p>
<p>goods). 
6) Shipping by air if weight is less than 200 kg. 
7) Shipping by air when a cold chain is required. 
8) Shipping by land or sea if dangerous goods are involved.

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 4: Transverse Procurement Themes  Page 4-23 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Finally, procurement officers should make a prioritized list of all technically feasible solutions. If 
a priority solution falls within the pre-defined budgetary framework, the plan should be 
executed.  
 
If the best solutions fall outside the framework or if no solution is feasible, procurement officers 
should present the existing options to the requesting operational unit and ask for a decision. 
 
Forwarding agents 
Forwarding agents, also known as freight forwarders or freight brokers, are contracted by the UN 
organization or the supplier to carry out the formalities and operations of consignment.  
 
The forwarding agent can also be employed by the organization to receive goods where UN staff 
members may not be physically present in order to engage in the prompt clearance and collection 
of goods vulnerable to loss or pilferage.  
 
The use of an appropriate freight forwarder reduces the risk of the procurement operation, since 
part of the risk is transferred from the organization to the selected forwarding agent. Further, the 
choice &nbsp;of &nbsp;an &nbsp;appropriate &nbsp;forwarder &nbsp;in &nbsp;itself &nbsp;reduces &nbsp;risk &nbsp;due &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;forwarder&rsquo;s &nbsp;experience &nbsp;and &nbsp;
specialized knowledge. 
 
Procurement officers should ensure that the respective forwarding agent has all necessary 
documents &nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;release &nbsp;of &nbsp;goods &nbsp;in &nbsp;transit &nbsp;(see &nbsp;under &nbsp;&lsquo;shipping &nbsp;documents). 
 
Incoterms 
Incoterms (The International Commerce Terms) are standard terms defining the obligations of 
both the buyer and seller relating to the shipment of goods. They are used world wide in both 
international and local trading. Incoterms have been established by the International Chamber of 
Commerce (ICC). 
 
The clear definition of trade terms reduces the risk of misunderstanding and, as the ICC offers an 
arbitration service, their interpretation is widely accepted. 
 
Incoterms 2000 should govern shipment terms of all contracts and reference to an appropriate 
Incoterm should be made in all contracts requiring shipment. The Incoterm should always refer 
to a named place (city, country, etc.). 
 
Procurement officers need to be familiar with Incoterms in order to understand the division of   
responsibilities and risks between the buyer and the seller. Further information can be sought 
through the ICC website at www.iccwbo.org. 
 
Use of Incoterms 
The table below lists the Incoterms most commonly used by UN organizations, and in which 
situations they should be used:

<p>Term For&hellip; 
(Delivery Duty 
Unpaid) 
</p>
<p>International procurement where the UN organization elects the 
supplier to bear all risks and costs associated with the transport of 
goods to the country of destination. However, considering the very 
good all-risk insurance coverage offered under the insurance 
programme negotiated globally by various UN organizations, it is 
highly recommended to purchase CPT for all international 
procurement and have the goods insured under the global insurance 
programme of the organization. 
Note: DDU for international procurement is justified in very few 
countries where the insurance programme does not provide full 
coverage (e.g. it excludes war risk). 
</p>
<p> 
Note: All the terms referred to above should be followed by the name of the destination point 
(for example CPT Baku, Azerbaijan). 
 
Insurance during transportation  
During transportation and storage, all cargo is vulnerable to a range of risks, such as damage, 
pilferage and theft, breakage, non-receipt of part of or an entire consignment. Cargo insurance 
provides protection against potential financial losses resulting from such risks.  
 
It is important to ensure protection for goods subject to risks, including war, strikes, riots and 
civil commotion. Further, the duration of insurance coverage should be sufficient for the period 
of transportation, from warehouse to warehouse, including storage at the destination site. Goods 
are insured for the cost, insurance and freight value plus an agreed percentage to reflect the 
indirect cost of replacing goods. 
 
In view of the above, most UN organizations have negotiated a global cargo insurance contract 
that all offices are encouraged to use. The insurance is usually an all-risk insurance with world 
wide coverage with the exception of war risk. War risk can be covered by an extra premium (sea 
and air transport). War risk on land is often a different coverage and might have to be contracted 
separately. Procurement officers should consult whoever is responsible within an organization 
for more information on the coverage, if in doubt. 
 
In the event of a claim, or event likely to give rise to a claim, notice should be given as early as 
possible, following the internal procedures of the organization. Note that insurance policies 
might have short deadlines for submission of claims. 
 
Shipping documents 
Complete and appropriate shipping documents are of critical importance for the timely delivery 
of goods. The supplier needs documents to move the order from its premises, and to receive 
payment from the buyer. The freight forwarder requires documents to contract carriage, the 
consignee requires documents to claim the goods at arrival, and the consignee or notify party 
requires documents to handle customs clearance. Each stage of the shipment generates 
documents that may even be required once the equipment is in the country, for instance to 
register a vehicle or radio equipment. 
 
The exact contents of a set of shipping documents depend on the type of goods being shipped, 
the means of transport, who is shipping the goods (freight forwarder, supplier, etc.), and any 
special requirements of the receiving country.  </p>

</p>
<p>While the particular documents required vary from case to case, every shipment should have 
documented evidence of: 
 
 contents of the shipment 
 weight and volume of contents 
 origin of goods (if required) 
 price of the goods  
 evidence of transport of the goods. 
 
The following shipping documents are common to all shipments:

Waybill 
(other modes of transport) 
</p>
<p> The contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier,

arrive. 
</p>
<p> Evidences that the carrier has received the goods for shipment, 
and is conclusive evidence that the goods were shipped as stated. 
</p>
<p> Documents ownership to the goods specified (a document of 
title). It is recommended to specify that the B/L be marked 
&lsquo;clean &nbsp;on &nbsp;board &nbsp;and &nbsp;freight &nbsp;prepaid&rsquo; &nbsp;(especially &nbsp;when &nbsp;using &nbsp;the &nbsp;
CPT Incoterm).

</p>
<p>Documents should be checked to ensure that all information is correct and consistent in all the 
documents. Further, procurement officers should ensure that the documents have been received 
by the consignee. 
 
Terms used in shipping documents 
The following terms are frequently used in shipping documents: 
 
Consignee 
The consignee is the receiver of the goods, usually, but not necessarily, an office of a UN 
organization. The consignee may be, but is not necessarily, identical to the delivery address. The 
consignee should always receive a copy of the shipping documents. 
 
The consignee may take care of customs clearance and other government formalities upon the 
request of the individual responsible for the procurement activity in question, however this may 
also be handled by a notify party. 
 
Consignee details, such as address, country, name, phone/fax, email, and contact person should 
be included in the purchase order and in the labelling of the packages. 
 
Notify party 
A notify party may be engaged by procurement officers (or the consignee) in order to arrange 
customs clearance of goods and other government formalities. In such case, shipping documents 
are also to be forwarded to the notify party. 
 
Delivery address/final destination 
The delivery address or final destination is the address of the end-user where the goods are to be 
physically delivered. 
 
Receipt of consignments 
When a consignment is delivered to the consignee, it is common practice for the carrier to 
request a receipt. At the same time, the consignee should perform a cursory inspection of 
packages against all shipping documents. If, in apparent good order, it is recommended that an 
endorsement &nbsp;be &nbsp;given &nbsp;(e.g. &nbsp;&ldquo;received &nbsp;in &nbsp;good external condition &ndash; contents &nbsp;unchecked&rdquo;). &nbsp;If, &nbsp;
however, signs of tampering are visible, the receipt should state necessary reservations (e.g. 
&ldquo;cases &nbsp;broken&rdquo;, &nbsp;&ldquo;contents &nbsp;lacking&rdquo;, &nbsp;&ldquo;cartons &nbsp;opened &nbsp;with &nbsp;signs &nbsp;of &nbsp;pilferage&rdquo;). &nbsp;Where &nbsp;possible, &nbsp;
packages should be weighed to determine differences between declared and actual weights, 
documenting any discrepancies on the delivery notes.   
 
 
Restrictions on the export or import of goods 
 
Exporting countries may restrict the shipment of certain classes of goods to certain countries or 
ban their export altogether. Equipment that has a dual civilian/military use or high-end computer 
and telecommunications technology are commonly considered. The procurement officer should 
be aware of these restrictions so that lead time required for authorisation can be calculated and 
the sourcing strategy modified if necessary.    
 
Importing countries may also impose restrictions.  Telecommunications equipment and 
pharmaceuticals typically require prior authorisation from the concerned ministry who will issue 
a licence.  Other equipment, such as used vehicles older than a certain age, may be banned </p>

</p>
<p>outright. Some countries ban goods of certain origins for political reasons. Obtaining permits is 
generally a protracted exercise. The receiving office must confirm that it is in hand before the 
supplier is authorized to ship the goods. The likely consequence of shipping without the permit is 
that the receiver will be required to pay the cost of storage in the port and applicable liner 
charges until the authorisation is issued. There is also the considerable risk that the cargo will 
deteriorate or go missing during this period. There are also UN restrictions for countries. For

<p>4.4 Ethics in Procurement 
 
Introduction 
 
There are two definitions of ethics as follows: 
 
 The moral principles governing or influencing conduct. 
 The branch of knowledge concerned with moral principles (The concise Oxford dictionary of 
</p>
<p>current English). 
 
Ethics is the basis on which most of the procurement related principles, such as fairness, 
integrity, and transparency, are based. 
 
Professional standards of ethical conduct, no matter what the organization, contain typical 
characteristics, including commitments to: 
 
 Behave honourably in all aspects of work and professional activity. 
 Conduct oneself in such a manner as to maintain trust and confidence in the integrity of the 
</p>
<p>acquisition process. 
 Avoid &nbsp;&ldquo;clever&rdquo; &nbsp;practices &nbsp;intended &nbsp;to &nbsp;take &nbsp;undue &nbsp;advantage &nbsp;of &nbsp;others &nbsp;or &nbsp;the &nbsp;system. 
 Uphold &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;standards &nbsp;and &nbsp;policies &nbsp;and &nbsp;all &nbsp;relevant &nbsp;legislation. 
 Avoid conflicts of interest. 
 
 
Codes of conduct 
 
Organizations and professions often seek to address standards of conduct through the adoption of 
codes of conduct. Professional codes of conduct generally are written in broad conceptual terms 
rather than in specific situational or descriptive terms. They leave room for interpretation and 
often may seem ambiguous.  Procurement professionals cannot abide merely by the letter of the 
law or the specific words in any code, but rather, they are guided by the spirit of the law or the 
broader concept that the code is intended to express. One reason why many procuring 
organizations avoid detailed and specific codes is these may give the impression that anything 
not prohibited is permitted or that anything not specifically addressed is not important. People in 
other professions who have not been trained in or are not appreciative of procurement ethics may 
not realize that a situation not specifically identified in the code may still be vitally important. 
Those who do not understand the foundation of a general requirement may not be able to apply a 
code in a specific situation. 
 
No matter how hard policy-makers try, they will never specify in law, code, regulation, rule, or 
other written requirement everything that a procurement officer needs to know regarding what is 
allowed or appropriate and what is prohibited or shunned.  It is necessary for procurement 
officers to understand what the law or rule is intended to accomplish.   
 
The primary UN system regulations and rules on ethics and behavioural standards are contained 
in the Secretary-General&rsquo;s &nbsp;Bulletin, &nbsp;&ldquo;Status, &nbsp;Basic &nbsp;Rights &nbsp;and &nbsp;Duties &nbsp;of &nbsp;United &nbsp;Nations &nbsp;Staff &nbsp;
Members,&rdquo; &nbsp;ST/SGB/2002/13, &nbsp;as &nbsp;well &nbsp;as &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;&ldquo;Standards &nbsp;of &nbsp;Conduct &nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;International &nbsp;Civil &nbsp;
Service&rdquo; &nbsp;(Jan &nbsp;2002). &nbsp; &nbsp;See &nbsp;Annexes &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp;The &nbsp;United &nbsp;Nations Oath of Office (see Annex 4) clearly </p>

</p>
<p>expresses &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN&rsquo;s &nbsp;values, &nbsp;principles, &nbsp;rules &nbsp;and &nbsp;regulations &nbsp;and &nbsp;how &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;officers &nbsp;
should regulate their conduct and perform their duties within the interests of the UN. 
 
The respective FRR guiding the procurement process of the UN organizations also address 
several ethical values such as fairness, integrity, transparency and equal treatment. 
 
 
Stewardship 
 
According to The concise Oxford dictionary of current English, &nbsp;a &nbsp;steward &nbsp;is &nbsp;&ldquo;a &nbsp;person &nbsp;employed &nbsp;
to manage another&rsquo;s &nbsp;property.&rdquo; &nbsp;When &nbsp;the &nbsp;steward &nbsp;is &nbsp;a &nbsp;UN &nbsp;staff &nbsp;member, &nbsp;the &nbsp;&ldquo;person&rdquo; &nbsp;whose &nbsp;
property &nbsp;the &nbsp;steward &nbsp;is &nbsp;managing &nbsp;consists &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;entire &nbsp;world&rsquo;s &nbsp;population &nbsp;- an immense 
responsibility. 
 
Spending money that comes from all Member States and a variety of other public sources is a 
special kind of stewardship with which international procurement officers are entrusted. They 
must spend UN money only in the way that it is meant to be spent and must not deviate from the 
procedures to suit their own convenience. 
 
All UN officials are required to display the utmost loyalty to the United Nations, its Charter, 
rules and regulations over their respective personal preferences and gains. This requirement is 
straightforward and unbending. However, exercising the high standards of professional 
responsibility expected of UN staff members is not always easy. It requires UN staff members to 
exercise clear judgement every day in conforming their professional practices and outside 
relationships with the spirit and letter of prescribed rules and regulations as well as broader and 
harder to define ethical standards. 
 
UN procurement officers can face highly competing pressures. The pressure to satisfy the 
demands for quicker turnarounds, better quality, and lower prices in procurement can compete 
with the pressure to fulfil their duties with the utmost responsibility and ethical standards. 
 
It is therefore the main role of each UN procurement officer to execute their procurement 
function according to the highest standards of professionalism and in the respect of the values, 
objectives and interests of the organization. This implies the procurement officer must adhere to 
the principles of fairness, impartiality, transparency, stewardship, to avoid conflict of interest and 
any impropriety, and &nbsp;to &nbsp;respect &nbsp;and &nbsp;apply &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;relevant &nbsp;policies, &nbsp;rules &nbsp;and &nbsp;
procedures. 
 
 
Ethical concepts and principles 
 
Some ethical concepts and principles that relate to the procurement process are: 
 
 loyalty and respect for rules and regulations 
 integrity 
 impartiality and fairness 
 transparency 
 confidentiality 
 avoidance of appearance of impropriety 
 due diligence. </p>

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 4: Transverse Procurement Themes  Page 4-30 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Loyalty and respect for rules and regulations 
UN procurement officers are charged with the highest standards of loyalty and discretion. When 
undersigning &nbsp;the &nbsp;&lsquo;Oath &nbsp;of &nbsp;Office&rsquo;, &nbsp;UN &nbsp;staff &nbsp;members &nbsp;promise: 
 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;to &nbsp;exercise &nbsp;in &nbsp;all &nbsp;loyalty, &nbsp;discretion &nbsp;and &nbsp;conscience &nbsp;the &nbsp;functions &nbsp;entrusted &nbsp;to &nbsp;me &nbsp;as &nbsp;
an international civil servant of the United Nations, to discharge these functions and 
regulate my conduct with the interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek 
or accept instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government or 
other &nbsp;authority &nbsp;external &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization.&rdquo; &nbsp; 
</p>
<p> 
Article 100 of the United Nations Charter requires &nbsp;UN &nbsp;staff &nbsp;members &nbsp;to, &nbsp;&ldquo;refrain &nbsp;from &nbsp;any &nbsp;
action which might reflect on their position as international officials responsible only to the 
organization.&rdquo; &nbsp; 
Article &nbsp;101, &nbsp;Para. &nbsp;3, &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;United &nbsp;Nations &nbsp;Charter &nbsp;states: &nbsp;&ldquo;the &nbsp;paramount &nbsp;consideration &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;
employment of the staff and its determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity 
of &nbsp;securing &nbsp;the &nbsp;highest &nbsp;standards &nbsp;of &nbsp;efficiency, &nbsp;competency, &nbsp;and &nbsp;integrity&hellip;.&rdquo; &nbsp; 
 
In summary, the UN procurement officer should: 
 
 Stand by decisions that are in the organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;interest &nbsp;even &nbsp;if &nbsp;they &nbsp;are &nbsp;unpopular. 
 Understand the rules and regulations pertaining to his or her profession and organization. 
 Know why the rules and regulations are necessary. 
 Know what caused the rules and regulations to be enacted. 
 Respect the need for the formality of rules and regulations. 
 Interpret and apply rules in accordance with their intent. 
 Be able to perform procurement responsibilities effectively and efficiently and still abide by 
</p>
<p>the pertinent rules. 
 
Permitted exceptions to requirements should be kept to a minimum and be fully justified and 
documented. If a rule or regulation must be reconsidered or changed, the procurement officer 
should pursue the appropriate process to submit the recommended revision through established 
channels and include complete documentation to explain and justify the proposed change.  
 
During this process, the existing regulations, rules and procedures must be followed. The 
procurement officer must perform regulated tasks consistently according to the specified 
procedures and take a leadership role to help co-workers and stakeholders understand and follow 
them as well. 
 
Integrity 
UN procurement officers are expected to maintain superior standards of integrity and moral 
values. The International Civil Service &nbsp;Advisory &nbsp;Board &nbsp;identifies &nbsp;integrity &nbsp;as, &nbsp;&ldquo;one &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;
fundamental, &nbsp;if &nbsp;not &nbsp;paramount, &nbsp;standards &nbsp;of &nbsp;conduct&rdquo; &nbsp;which &nbsp;is, &nbsp;&ldquo;underlined &nbsp;in &nbsp;Article &nbsp;101 &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;
United Nations Charter and explicit or implicit in corresponding articles of the basic instruments 
of &nbsp;the &nbsp;specialized &nbsp;agencies.&rdquo; &nbsp;Their &nbsp;report &nbsp;explains: 
 
&ldquo;Integrity, &nbsp;while &nbsp;perhaps &nbsp;not &nbsp;subject &nbsp;to &nbsp;exhaustive &nbsp;and &nbsp;precise &nbsp;definition, &nbsp;must &nbsp;be &nbsp;judged &nbsp;on &nbsp;
the basis of the total behaviour of the person concerned. Such elementary personal or 
private qualities as honesty, truthfulness, fidelity, probity and freedom from corrupting 
influences, are clearly included. For the international official, however, the Charter also 
requires integrity as a public official, and especially as an international public official. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UN &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;Practitioner&rsquo;s &nbsp;Handbook  Nov 2006 
   
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 4: Transverse Procurement Themes  Page 4-31 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Perhaps the clearest expression of this is the fact that he has dedicated himself to regulate 
his conduct with the interests of the international organization only in view. It follows that he 
must subordinate his private interests and avoid placing himself in a position where those 
interests &nbsp;would &nbsp;conflict &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;interests &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization &nbsp;he &nbsp;serves.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> 
&ldquo;The &nbsp;concept &nbsp;of &nbsp;integrity &nbsp;enshrined &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;Charter &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;United &nbsp;Nations &nbsp;embraces &nbsp;all &nbsp;
aspects of behaviour of an international civil servant, including such qualities as honesty, 
truthfulness, impartiality, and incorruptibility. These qualities are as basic as those of 
competence &nbsp;and &nbsp;efficiency, &nbsp;also &nbsp;enshrined &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;Charter&hellip;&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> 
Cultural differences including nationality, ethnicity, industry or profession, must be set aside. 
Generic principles of integrity that extend beyond and rise above such differences must be 
allowed to prevail, especially in connection with the business transactions conducted by UN 
procurement officers. 
 
Integrity, to a procurement officer in the international marketplace, means believing that the 
public trust is so important that it cannot be compromised. A procurement officer should 
therefore demonstrate integrity by: 
 
 Upholding the principles of the United Nations Charter. 
 Demonstrating the values of the UN, including impartiality, fairness, honesty, and truthfulness, 
</p>
<p>in daily activities and behaviours. 
 Acting without consideration of personal gain. 
 Resisting undue political pressure in decision making. 
 Not abusing power or authority. 
 Taking prompt action in cases of unprofessional or unethical behaviour. 
 
Impartiality and fairness 
In &nbsp;a &nbsp;report &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;International &nbsp;Civil &nbsp;Service &nbsp;Advisory &nbsp;Board &nbsp;&lsquo;impartiality&rsquo; &nbsp;features &nbsp;as &nbsp;a &nbsp;key &nbsp;
requirement.  The report states: 
 
&ldquo;Impartiality &nbsp;implies &nbsp;objectivity, lack of bias, tolerance, restraint - particularly when 
political &nbsp;or &nbsp;religious &nbsp;disputes &nbsp;or &nbsp;differences &nbsp;arise. &nbsp; &nbsp;The &nbsp;staff &nbsp;member&rsquo;s &nbsp;personal &nbsp;views &nbsp;and &nbsp;
convictions &nbsp;remain &nbsp;inviolate, &nbsp;but &nbsp;he &nbsp;has &nbsp;not &nbsp;the &nbsp;freedom &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;private &nbsp;person &nbsp;to &nbsp;&ldquo;take &nbsp;sides,&rdquo; &nbsp;
to enter a dispute as a partisan, or publicly to express his convictions on matters of a 
controversial nature, either singly or as a member of a group. Just as the practice of 
impartiality will strengthen the secretariat, repeated instances of partiality, or bias, will do 
serious &nbsp;harm &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p> 
According to The concise Oxford dictionary of current English, &nbsp;&ldquo;fair&rdquo; &nbsp;is &nbsp;defined &nbsp;as &nbsp;&ldquo;just, &nbsp;
unbiased, &nbsp;and &nbsp;equitable;; &nbsp;in &nbsp;accordance &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;rules&rdquo;. &nbsp; &nbsp;In &nbsp;the &nbsp;context &nbsp;of &nbsp;impartiality &nbsp;and &nbsp;fairness &nbsp;
and accordance with the definition above, the procurement officer should: 
 
 Set aside all personal and organizational biases. 
 Apply the same standards of evaluation to all the suppliers (equal treatment). 
 
For example, if one supplier requests additional information, all suppliers should receive that 
information at the same time. Or, if one offer is disqualified in the evaluation process and the 
award placed with the next highest priced offer, the reason for disqualifying the lower offer must 
be applied to all evaluations uniformly.  </p>

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 4: Transverse Procurement Themes  Page 4-32 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>Fairness &nbsp;implies &nbsp;being &nbsp;reasonable &nbsp;as &nbsp;well &nbsp;as &nbsp;impartial, &nbsp;and &nbsp;treating &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN&rsquo;s &nbsp;trading &nbsp;partners &nbsp;
with professional, businesslike courtesy, as well as with strict adherence to the policies and 
procedures for conducting the transaction. 
 
Transparency 
Transparency means unimpeded visibility.  Because public procurement involves the use of and 
accountability for public funds, transparency is, perhaps, paramount in all procurement activities. 
 
All transactions are subject to scrutiny but not all organizations experience such scrutiny to the 
degree of the UN. Therefore, procurement officers and assistants must always conduct 
themselves in such a way that any scrutiny would not damage the UN or its leaders, member 
organizations, staff, or programmes. 
 
There are two degrees of transparency: 
 internal scrutiny 
 external scrutiny. 
 
Internal scrutiny 
Internal scrutiny is transparency within the UN, such as examination conducted by internal 
auditors. &nbsp;It &nbsp;seeks &nbsp;to &nbsp;ascertain &nbsp;compliance &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;UN&rsquo;s &nbsp;own &nbsp;standards &nbsp;by &nbsp;the UN&rsquo;s &nbsp;own &nbsp;
compliance officers. 
 
External scrutiny 
External scrutiny is transparency outside the UN, such as examination by Member States, the 
press, external auditors, or other outside observers. It refers to the notion that almost anyone can 
observe UN activities and watch how the UN conducts its business. 
 
Only when something is truly of a confidential nature, such as proprietary data belonging to a 
supplier, or proposals being evaluated prior to contract award, should confidentiality be given a 
higher priority over transparency while still maintaining an overall transparent process.  
 
Even though details of pricing data or trade secrets may be held confidential, procurement 
officers should always assume that how they do their work is available to the public. 
 
Confidentiality 
Confidentiality needs extra consideration in UN procurement, due to the delicate nature of the 
information that is handled in procurement processes, such as pricing of products, marketing 
strategies, etc. A breach in the confidentiality of the data handled in the procurement process 
could result in discredit of the UN and distrust from governments, partners or suppliers.  
 
The concept of confidentiality is repeated in several instances in the Code of Conduct 
documented in the Standards of Conduct in the International Civil Service 2001; 
ST/SGB/2002/13, Regulation 1.2 (i) and V, 35.  It states that: 
  
&ldquo;Staff &nbsp;members &nbsp;shall &nbsp;exercise &nbsp;the &nbsp;utmost &nbsp;discretion &nbsp;with &nbsp;regard &nbsp;to &nbsp;all &nbsp;matters &nbsp;of &nbsp;official &nbsp;
business. They shall not communicate to any Government, entity, person or any other source 
of information known to them by reason of their official position that they know or ought to 
have known has not been made public except as appropriate in the normal course of their 
duties or by authorisation of the Secretary General. These obligations do not cease upon 
separation &nbsp;from &nbsp;service.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;The &nbsp;disclosure &nbsp;of &nbsp;information &nbsp;may &nbsp;seriously &nbsp;jeopardise &nbsp;the &nbsp;efficiency &nbsp;and &nbsp;credibility &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;
organization. International Civil Servants are responsible for exercising discretion in all 
matters of official business. They must not divulge confidential information without 
authorisation. Nor should international civil servants use information that has not been 
made public and is known to them by virtue of their official position to private advantage. 
These &nbsp;obligations &nbsp;do &nbsp;not &nbsp;cease &nbsp;upon &nbsp;separation &nbsp;from &nbsp;service.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> 
Confidentially might seem in contradiction with transparency, but what this means is, the way 
the overall procurement process is conducted needs to be clear and transparent, while truly 
proprietary data needs to remain confidential.  
 
Avoidance of the appearance of impropriety 
In &nbsp;the &nbsp;private &nbsp;sector, &nbsp;appearances &nbsp;are &nbsp;tempered &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;wishes &nbsp;or &nbsp;standards &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;
leadership. Employee behaviour is judged according to legality and the satisfaction of owners or 
customers. However, international public-sector procurement officers must adhere to more 
conservative standards. 
 
UN procurement officers must be constantly aware of how their actions appear to outside 
observers. Observers may not understand the pressures of their profession.  UN procurement 
officers should always behave in such a way that observers could not misconstrue their actions as 
improper.  
 
This added dimension of the appearance of impropriety places an extra responsibility on 
procurement professionals. What people think on observing a UN staff member is not trivial. 
What &nbsp;people &nbsp;think &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;officer&rsquo;s &nbsp;behaviour &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;the &nbsp;basis &nbsp;of &nbsp;major &nbsp;scandals &nbsp;
based on misunderstandings and erroneous information &nbsp;that &nbsp;can &nbsp;damage &nbsp;an &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;
effectiveness in achieving its mission. In an international arena, the damage can be immense and 
even unthinkable. 
 
Acting &nbsp;properly &nbsp;in &nbsp;a &nbsp;&ldquo;technical&rdquo; &nbsp;sense &nbsp;is &nbsp;not &nbsp;enough;; &nbsp;avoiding &nbsp;even &nbsp;the &nbsp;appearance &nbsp;of &nbsp;
impropriety is also necessary. This appearance must be anticipated in the most conservative 
terms considering how varied the cultures are of those who observe UN activities. 
 
UN staff members in almost all environments are strongly advised to avoid such appearances. 
The newspapers are full of stories about people who did not avoid appearances of impropriety.  
 
Not all societies have the same standards or traditions about what is proper and what is not. It is 
important to recognise cultural differences in appearances and to anticipate, in the most 
conservative &nbsp;terms, &nbsp;what &nbsp;might &nbsp;be &nbsp;perceived &nbsp;as &nbsp;improper &nbsp;conduct &nbsp;(&ldquo;conservative&rdquo; &nbsp;does &nbsp;not &nbsp;mean &nbsp;
the same thing to staff from different cultures). 
 
Due diligence 
Due diligence in the context of UN procurement refers to carrying out duties carefully and 
thoroughly and avoiding careless practices or techniques.  Due diligence requires that all 
activities by procurement officers be pursued in a manner that goes beyond the minimum effort.  
For example, diligent UN procurement officers should: 
 check the references of potential suppliers 
 develop impartial evaluation criteria 
 carefully analyse the offers received 
 not cut corners for the sake of convenience. </p>

<p>Ethical risks and actions to manage them 
 
Some of the common ethical risks in the procurement process include: 
 
 conflict of interest 
 fraud 
 corruption 
 coercion 
 collusion. 
 
Conflict of interest 
A very common risk situation related to ethics in procurement is the risk of a conflict of interest. 
Conflict of interest can be defined as a direct or mutually exclusive clash between the interest of 
the UN and the private or personal interest of a UN procurement officer.  The Standards of 
Conduct in the International Civil Service (standards of conduct) states that: 
 
&ldquo;Staff &nbsp;members &nbsp;shall &nbsp;not &nbsp;use &nbsp;their office or knowledge gained from their official functions 
for &nbsp;private &nbsp;gain, &nbsp;financial &nbsp;or &nbsp;otherwise, &nbsp;or &nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;private &nbsp;gain &nbsp;of &nbsp;any &nbsp;third &nbsp;party &nbsp;(&hellip;).&rdquo; 
 
&ldquo;Staff &nbsp;members &nbsp;shall &nbsp;not &nbsp;be &nbsp;actively &nbsp;associated &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;management &nbsp;of, &nbsp;or &nbsp;hold &nbsp;a &nbsp;
financial interest in any profit-making business or other concern, if it were possible for the 
staff member or the profit-making, business or other concern to benefit from such 
association &nbsp;or &nbsp;financial &nbsp;interest &nbsp;by &nbsp;reason &nbsp;of &nbsp;his &nbsp;or &nbsp;her &nbsp;position &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;United &nbsp;Nations&rdquo; 
 
&ldquo;A &nbsp;staff &nbsp;member who has occasion to deal in his or her official capacity with any matter 
involving a profit-making business or other concern in which he or she holds a financial 
interest, directly or indirectly, shall disclose the measure of that interest to the Secretary-
General and, except otherwise authorized by the Secretary-General, either dispose of that 
financial interest or formally excuse himself or herself from participating with regard to 
any involvement in that matter which gives rise to the conflict of interest.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> 
In the context of procurement, a UN procurement officer should: 
 
 Declare with immediate effect any potential conflict of interest. 
 Not use information obtained for professional reasons for personal profit. 
 Disclose and dispose the financial interest involved.  
 Not participate in any conflicting procurement process.  
 Excuse or withdraw from any procurement process where the procurement officer may have a 
</p>
<p>conflicting interest. 
  
Declaration 
It is good practice to have officials involved in the procurement process, including those 
participating in offer opening panels, evaluation committees or contracts committees sign, in 
advance of their duties, a declaration of no conflict of interest. 
 
Honesty, truthfulness, impartiality, and incorruptibility are to be applied whenever a conflict of 
interest or the appearance of conflict of interest arises in the course of conducting procurement.

</p>
<p>Gifts and gratuities 
A common conflict of interest situation UN procurement officers have to face is whether or not 
to accept gifts from suppliers, partners or governments.  
 
Offering gifts to customers is a very common practice in the private sector. It is a marketing 
strategy based on the universal sense of reciprocity: if we receive something, we feel obliged to 
give something &nbsp;in &nbsp;exchange;; &nbsp;i.e. &nbsp;there &nbsp;is &nbsp;no &nbsp;such &nbsp;thing &nbsp;like &nbsp;a &nbsp;&ldquo;free &nbsp;lunch&rdquo;. &nbsp;Suppliers &nbsp;often &nbsp;offer &nbsp;
different types of gifts, for example perishable products, hospitality, free training courses or 
experiences like exhibitions, fair trades, and sometimes in kind donations, etc. that are related to 
the activity of the specific UN organization.  
 
Identifying covert gifts is not always easy, especially when at times, for example, training 
activities may be seen as beneficial for the organization; however, very careful review of the 
impact should be taken into account: would receiving the gift benefit one company over the 
others? Would acceptance be fair to the competitors? In cases where the content of such training 
/ events is deemed appropriate and beneficial for the organization in a technical sense, self 
financial support, i.e. for travel expenses should be considered.  
 
It can be difficult to judge how to behave in a particular situation, and what would be the 
appropriate action. The table below provides some examples of good practice: 
 
If &nbsp;the &nbsp;gift &nbsp;is&hellip; Then&hellip; 
Low value, e.g. chocolates, given at 
the end of the year 
</p>
<p>Accept it but tell suppliers it will be shared with all 
colleagues in your office. 
</p>
<p>High value, e.g. a gold watch Return it, and thank the supplier but say you are not 
allowed to accept it. 
</p>
<p>Relatively high value, e.g. a good 
bottle of wine, given at the end of the 
year 
</p>
<p>Thank the supplier, but tell them it will be put in a 
lottery (if there is such a policy in your organization) 
where it will be drawn. 
</p>
<p>Sent to your private address Immediately return it to the supplier, and tell the 
supplier it is unacceptable practice to send gifts to UN 
staff &nbsp;members&rsquo; &nbsp;private &nbsp;addresses. 
</p>
<p> 
 
In the context of gifts and gratuities, the standards of conduct state that: 
 
&ldquo;No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from any 
Government.&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;No &nbsp;staff &nbsp;member &nbsp;shall &nbsp;accept &nbsp;any &nbsp;honour, &nbsp;decoration, &nbsp;favour, &nbsp;gift &nbsp;or &nbsp;
remuneration from any non-governmental source without first obtaining the approval of the 
Secretary-General&rdquo; 
 
A UN procurement officer should: 
 
 Be able to identify covert gifts. 
 Not accept any gift from governmental or non governmental sources, but reports them to the 
</p>
<p>designated authorities. 
 Be aware of the reasons for not accepting such benefits. 
 Be aware of the impact on the organization if accepting such benefits.  
 </p>

</p>
<p>While the UN Secretariat has a zero tolerance policy regarding accepting gifts and 
gratuities, other UN organizations may have their own guidelines in that respect.  UN 
procurement officers are responsible to knnow and apply the respective guidelines of their 
organization. 
 
Fraud 
Fraud means the intentional, false representation or concealment of a material fact for the 
purpose of inducing another to act upon it to his/her detriment, for example in order to influence 
the competitive selection process or the execution of a contract. 
 
There are four common fraud scenarios in procurement. These are: 
 
 A person with responsibility for buying defrauds his or her employer. 
 Suppliers defraud their customers. 
 Suppliers &nbsp;and &nbsp;buyers &nbsp;work &nbsp;together &nbsp;to &nbsp;defraud &nbsp;the &nbsp;buyer&rsquo;s &nbsp;employer. 
 Buyers make personal gain at the expense of the supplier. 
 
Corruption 
Corruption means the practice of offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting, directly or indirectly 
anything of value to influence the action of a public official in the competitive selection process 
or in contract execution. 
 
There are two common types of corruption: 
 
Approach Includes 
Direct  Cash paid to the procurement officer, to settle the buyer&rsquo;s &nbsp;personal &nbsp;
</p>
<p>debts &nbsp;or &nbsp;paid &nbsp;to &nbsp;a &nbsp;third &nbsp;party &nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;buyer&rsquo;s &nbsp;benefit. 
 Cheques paid directly to the buyer or members of his family, paid to 
</p>
<p>businesses in which the buyer has an interest. 
 Cheques &nbsp;paid &nbsp;to &nbsp;settle &nbsp;the &nbsp;buyer&rsquo;s &nbsp;personal &nbsp;debts. 
 Shares and share options. 
 Free or discounted goods or services. 
</p>
<p>Indirect  Employment &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;member &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;buyer&rsquo;s &nbsp;family, &nbsp;or &nbsp;employment &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;
buyer on a consultancy basis. 
</p>
<p> Future offers of the same. 
 Inside information which will benefit the buyer. 
 Threats of blackmail or violence. 
 Free &nbsp;travel &nbsp;and &nbsp;expenses &nbsp;to &nbsp;visit &nbsp;exhibitions &nbsp;or &nbsp;to &nbsp;visit &nbsp;suppliers&rsquo; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>factories. 
 Invitation to entertainment events. 
</p>
<p> 
Coercion 
Coercion means harming or threatening to harm, directly or indirectly, persons, or their property 
to influence their participation in the procurement process, or affect the execution of a contract. 
 
Collusion 
Collusion means a scheme or arrangement between two or more suppliers, with or without 
knowledge of the UN organisation, designed to establish prices at artificial, non-competitive 
levels. </p>

Potential areas of risk in the procurement cycle 
 
Some potential areas of risk relating to ethics in the procurement cycle are listed in the table 
below. 
 
Area of risk Explanation and examples 
Budgeting Fraud and corruption must be paid for from somewhere. Lack of 
</p>
<p>proper budgetary control, for example when all funds are not allocated 
to a specific purpose, can provide the necessary funds. 
</p>
<p>Financial approval 
policy 
</p>
<p>Without regular audits and strict management controls, there are 
opportunities &nbsp;for &nbsp;fraudulent &nbsp;use &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;person&rsquo;s &nbsp;own &nbsp;levels &nbsp;of &nbsp;authority, &nbsp;
or &nbsp;of &nbsp;misusing &nbsp;someone &nbsp;else&rsquo;s. 
</p>
<p>Perceived need Requirements can be invented or falsified. 
Specification 
development 
</p>
<p>Specifications can be written to favour a specific supplier. 
Clarifications on specifications can be provided to one of the invitees 
only during the tendering process. 
</p>
<p>Evaluation criteria Evaluation criteria can be written, or amended, after receipt of offers 
to favour a particular supplier. 
</p>
<p>Pre-qualification This process can be used to limit the field of competition to give a 
favoured supplier an advantage. 
</p>
<p>Invitation to 
tender/sourcing 
</p>
<p>This process can be used to give the illusion of competition where it 
does not really exists by inviting tenders from companies who are 
known to be unsatisfactory, or by not sending out complete 
specifications to all tenders at the same time etc. 
</p>
<p>Offer evaluation Fraud at this stage occurs mainly when objective evaluation criteria 
have not been agreed in advance. It can also occur where technical 
staff is able to use their specialist knowledge to mislead other 
members of the evaluation team. 
</p>
<p>Negotiation Favoured suppliers can be assisted or given useful information during 
negotiations. 
</p>
<p>Contract award There are opportunities for fraud by the supplier either through 
deliberately fraudulent acts or through buyer incompetence. 
</p>
<p>Post award changes to 
specifications  
</p>
<p>This allows suppliers to increase profits, particularly when awarded 
the contract on an attractively low offer price. 
</p>
<p>Goods receipt Examples are: Allowing under-deliveries of goods or non-
performance to specifications, or drafting false goods inward notes; 
deliberate over ordering; allowing inventory to dwindle so that 
emergency orders at a higher price will have to be processed. 
</p>
<p>Invoice certification 
 
</p>
<p>Deliberate overcharging, backdating orders to allow benefit from price 
changes, paying twice, failing to insist on or monitor retentions. 
</p>
<p>Decentralized 
procurement 
organization 
</p>
<p>In decentralized organizations the responsibilities are delegated to a 
large number of people, and it is difficult for the central procurement 
function to exercise total control and to be aware of what is going on 
in the decentralized units. Although decentralisation can often 
improve efficiency and reduce costs, it can also increase the risks of </p>

Potential warning signs of unethical practices 
There are some typical signs that may indicate or warn of unethical practices.  These include, but 
are not limited to the following: 
 
 deviations from correct procedures 
 overcharging by the supplier 
 poor record keeping 
 missing files 
 poor or no separation of duties (for example, the same person issues the order and approves the 
</p>
<p>payment) 
 poor control (for example, only one person signs a contract) 
 buyer&rsquo;s &nbsp;extravagant life style 
 buyer&rsquo;s &nbsp;frequent &nbsp;absence &nbsp;from &nbsp;the &nbsp;office 
 excessive entertaining by suppliers 
 resistance to audit 
 reluctance to delegate 
 excessive secrecy 
 dictatorial management style 
 unnecessary meetings with suppliers 
 not allowing other staff to deal with certain suppliers 
 established &nbsp;suppliers&rsquo; &nbsp;reluctance &nbsp;of &nbsp;entering &nbsp;competitive &nbsp;tendering 
 supplier cartels. 
 
Tools and mechanisms to prevent and detect unethical practices 
Some tools and mechanisms that may be used to prevent and detect the occurrence of unethical 
practices are listed below. 
 
Management responsibility 
Management should maintain the highest standards of integrity in its everyday dealings. Where 
senior management behaves dishonestly, corruption and fraud will spread to all levels.  
 
Management&rsquo;s &nbsp;responsibility &nbsp;is &nbsp;to &nbsp;set &nbsp;the &nbsp;highest &nbsp;standards &nbsp;of &nbsp;integrity &nbsp;and &nbsp;be &nbsp;an &nbsp;example &nbsp;for &nbsp;
everybody in the organization to follow. Managers should also point out correct behaviour to 
employees and draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.  
 
Management is also ultimately responsible for the operations and assets under their command. It 
is their responsibility and in their interest to ensure that the organization has the necessary 
procedures and control systems in place to ensure maximum security and minimize the risk of 
corruption and fraud. 
 
Code of ethics 
All organizations should develop a code of ethics for all staff to follow. A code of ethics is a 
formalized &nbsp;statement &nbsp;containing &nbsp;ethical &nbsp;codes &nbsp;of &nbsp;conduct &nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;organizations&rsquo; &nbsp;members &nbsp;to &nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p> 
Chapter 4: Transverse Procurement Themes  Page 4-39 
COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>follow. The Code of Ethics will clearly state what type of behaviour is expected from the 
members, and what type of behaviour is unacceptable.  
 
Organizational procedures 
To prevent fraud and corruption an organization should have in place the following 
organizational procedures: 
Procedures Including 
Pre-employment screening The background of all job applicants should be checked before 
</p>
<p>they are employed and granted access to premises and assets. 
Classification and 
protection of information 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clear &nbsp;desk &nbsp;policy&rsquo;, &nbsp;secure &nbsp;filing &nbsp;cabinets &nbsp;for &nbsp;all &nbsp;employees, &nbsp;
sufficient number of paper shredders, secure disposal of all waste 
paper 
</p>
<p>Data security standards Procedures should be introduced for all data processing resources. 
Instructions on minimum standards should be enforced 
</p>
<p>Incident reporting All employees should be responsible for reporting losses and 
security incidents.  
All incidents, regardless of how small they are, should be reported. 
</p>
<p> 
Personnel policies and procedures 
Fair, open, and efficient personnel policies &nbsp;and &nbsp;procedures &nbsp;reduce &nbsp;the &nbsp;organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;exposure &nbsp;to &nbsp;
fraud. UN organisations should consider the following factors in their personnel policies and 
procedures.  
 
Policies and procedures Factors to consider 
Job descriptions Security responsibilities should be drafted into contracts and job 
</p>
<p>descriptions to deter personnel from being dishonest. 
Education and training  Awareness training can clarify what is meant by ethical conduct, 
</p>
<p>short cuts, and fraud and contribute to the prevention of fraud. 
 Training programs can be supported by booklets on the 
organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;business &nbsp;ethics &nbsp;and &nbsp;security &nbsp;policies, &nbsp;articles &nbsp;in &nbsp;
internal newsletters or magazines, newsletters including reports 
on frauds discovered and the lessons learned from them, as well 
as films and videos. 
</p>
<p> New employee induction training can cover security. 
Investigation  Set down organizational rules for conducting investigations into 
</p>
<p>suspected or reported incidents of fraud or breaches of security, 
including employee obligations to assist in such investigations. 
</p>
<p> Criminal offences or reasons for disciplinary action should be 
brought to the attention of all staff. 
</p>
<p> 
Accounting controls 
The integrity of accounting systems is an essential element in preventing fraud. Controls should 
ensure that details of all goods and equipment moving in and out of the organization are recorded 
on serially numbered documents or computer records, and copies of documents recording 
movements are retained securely. Maximum use should be made of numerical controls, using 
documents with pre-printed serial numbers. 
 
Levels of authority to approve accounting transactions should be clearly defined and regularly 
audited. Each system should define who will be held responsible for losses, errors and </p>

COMMON CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE UN 
</p>
<p>concealment. Areas of responsibility should be identified and enforced. Books and records 
should be protected in the same way as all of the assets of the organization. 
 
Segregation of duties 
This is the most basic and one of the most effective ways of preventing fraud, since it removes 
the possibility &nbsp;of &nbsp;&lsquo;closed &nbsp;loops&rsquo;, &nbsp;that &nbsp;is, &nbsp;one &nbsp;person &nbsp;having &nbsp;the &nbsp;authority &nbsp;to &nbsp;budget, &nbsp;provision, &nbsp;
order and pay. Each transaction should be divided into a number of stages and no one person 
should ever have the authority to handle all of the stages. 
 
Control systems 
Control systems in procurement protect honest buyers and suppliers from false accusations of 
dishonesty, encourage them to work honestly and effectively, and prevent and detect corruption. 
 
It is often difficult to get the right balance between under- and over-control and many 
organizations have control systems which are either too restrictive or too lax. An effective and 
well-balanced control system needs to be flexible, allowing honest buyers and suppliers to 
operate efficiently, while at the same time minimising the risks of dishonesty. 
 
Controls in procurement 
Procurement procedures should be set out in a manual provided to all staff involved in 
procurement. Procedures, authorities, responsibilities and penalties for not adhering to 
procedures should be clearly defined. When setting the strategy for a particular procurement, the 
following factors should be taken into account: 
 
 The threshold above which contracts and orders must be put out for competitive tenders should 
</p>
<p>be clearly defined and enforced. 
 As far as possible, spot, short-term, or emergency orders should be avoided. 
 Cost-plus contracts should be avoided if possible, but if they cannot be avoided special care 
should &nbsp;be &nbsp;taken &nbsp;to &nbsp;verify &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;expenses. 
</p>
<p> 
Financial approval policy 
The policy on financial approval for procurement actions should be clearly communicated to all 
relevant staff. The consequence of abuse should be defined. Approval levels should not be set 
artificially low, but at a realistic level sufficient to enable employees to do their jobs efficiently.  
Standard terms and conditions of contract, and standard forms should be included in all 
solicitation documents as well as in all contracts and purchase orders. Standard forms used in 
procurement should be developed.  
 
Control over goods and services received 
Controlling the receipt and storage of goods is a vital aspect of eliminating opportunities for 
fraud.

<p>4.5 Sustainable Procurement 
 
Introduction 
 
Sustainable procurement (SP) is about taking social and environmental factors into consideration 
alongside financial factors in making procurement decisions. It involves looking beyond the 
traditional economic parameters and making decisions based on the whole life cost, the 
associated risks, measures of success and implications for society and the environment. Making 
decisions in this way requires setting procurement into the broader strategic context including 
value for money, performance management, corporate and community priorities. 
 
Sustainable procurement is the process by which organizations buy assets, supplies or services 
by taking into account a number of factors including: 
 
 Value for money considerations such as, price, quality, availability, functionality. 
 The entire life cycle of products. 
 Environmental aspects; the effects on the environment that the assets, supplies and/or services 
</p>
<p>have over the whole lifecycle ("green procurement"). 
 Social aspects: effects on issues such as poverty eradication, inequality in the distribution of 
</p>
<p>resources, labour conditions, human rights, Fair-trade. 
 Sustainable or recycled materials/products. 
 
 
Aim and challenge 
 
Traditional procurement has focused upon value for money considerations. The aim and 
challenge of sustainable procurement is to integrate environmental and social considerations into 
the procurement process, with the goal of reducing adverse impacts upon health, social 
conditions and the environment, thereby saving valuable costs for public sector organizations 
and the community at large. Sustainable procurement forms a key part of an overall push for 
sustainable development by governments and UN organizations1.  
 
 
Potential benefits 
 
Potential benefits of sustainable procurement include: 
 long-term efficiency savings 
 more efficient and effective use of natural resources 
 reducing the harmful impact of pollution and waste 
 reducing the impact of hazardous substances on human health and the environment 
 encouraging innovation 
 providing strong signals to the sustainable products market 
 practical &nbsp;expression &nbsp;of &nbsp;organizations&rsquo; &nbsp;commitment to sustainable development.

<p>Procurement as a mechanism to further economic, social and environmental 
development 
 
Procurement can be used as a mechanism to further the economic, social and environmental 
development of recipient countries and/or regions. As such, sustainable procurement should 
incorporate a number of safeguards and checks in the procurement process to positively assist in 
the following areas: 
 
 human rights 
 labour rights 
 environmental impacts 
 local entrepreneurship 
 empowerment women 
 poverty eradication 
 governance. 
 
Human rights  
Human rights are increasingly being seen as a business issue. They are inextricably linked to 
corporate risk and reputation management. By continuously expanding supplier sourcing 
strategies, as well as by increasing sourcing from developing countries procurement officers are 
increasingly exposed to companies operating in countries with repressive governments, ethnic 
conflict, and weak rule of law or poor labour standards. The procurement function must include 
processes that are designed to identify companies that flaunt their responsibility to uphold 
universal human rights towards their employees and toward the communities in which they 
operate.  
 
Labour rights  
With globalization and increasingly extending global supply chains, procurement officers have 
the unique opportunity as well as responsibility to ensure that the procurement function serves to 
protect workers rights. Companies operating in global markets are increasingly expected to 
assume some level of responsibility for labour practices along their supply chains. This 
responsibility can and should also form an integral component of the procurement function, by 
ensuring that contracted companies operate within the universally accepted International Labour 
Organization&rsquo;s &nbsp;(ILO) &nbsp;core &nbsp;conventions &nbsp;on &nbsp;labour &nbsp;standards. &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;officers &nbsp;should &nbsp;be &nbsp;
aware &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;potential &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;performance &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;following &nbsp;areas: 
 
 freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining 
 child labour 
 non-discrimination 
 bonded or forced labour 
 achieving decent working conditions. 
 
Adverse environmental impacts  
Procurement can play an integral role in promoting sustainable production and consumption 
patterns. It is widely recognised that industrial development will only be truly sustainable if it is 
built on firm ecological foundations.  The growing attention to issues of sustainable production 
and consumption is a natural outcome of decades of work on cleaner production and eco-
efficient industrial systems. It represents the final step in a progressive widening of the horizons 
of pollution prevention; a widening which has gone from a focus on production processes </p>

<p>(cleaner production), to products, (eco-design), then to product-systems (incorporating transport 
logistics, end-of-life collection and component reuse or materials recycling) and to eco-
innovation (new products and product-systems and enterprises designed for win-win solutions 
for business and the environment). Procurement is in the unique position to help influence 
industry by encouraging it to develop and adopt policies and practices that: 
 
 support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges 
 are cleaner and safer 
 make efficient use of resources 
 ensure adequate management of chemicals 
 incorporate environmental costs 
 reduce pollution and risks for humans and the environment. 
 
Supporting local entrepreneurship 
Strategic procurement can provide a framework to ensure that local content becomes an integral 
component of the procurement policies and practices. In this manner the procurement function 
can be adapted and utilized to achieve good practice in the goals of an organization  in terms of: 
 gender and the empowerment of women 
 poverty eradication 
 governance.  
 
Gender and the empowerment of women 
The Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) addressing &nbsp;this &nbsp;issue &nbsp;set &nbsp;a &nbsp;target &nbsp;for &nbsp;&ldquo;the &nbsp;
elimination of gender disparity in primary and secondary education preferably by 2005, and to 
all &nbsp;levels &nbsp;of &nbsp;education &nbsp;no &nbsp;later &nbsp;than &nbsp;2015&rdquo;. &nbsp;The &nbsp;procurement &nbsp;function &nbsp;can &nbsp;assist &nbsp;this &nbsp;issue &nbsp;by 
adopting practices that promote the contracting of minority businesses, particularly those owned 
by women. A straight forward and simple approach is to use an evaluation preference that 
favours minority business by a certain percentage (similar to the World &nbsp;Bank&rsquo;s &nbsp;Domestic &nbsp;
Preference policy). 
 
Poverty eradication 
The MDG calling for the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger set two targets that require 
the world to: 
 
1)  &ldquo;Halve, &nbsp;between &nbsp;1990 &nbsp;and &nbsp;2015, &nbsp;the &nbsp;proportion &nbsp;of &nbsp;people &nbsp;whose &nbsp;income &nbsp;is &nbsp;less &nbsp;than one 
</p>
<p>dollar &nbsp;a &nbsp;day&rdquo;. 
2)  &ldquo;Halve, &nbsp;between &nbsp;1990 &nbsp;and &nbsp;2015, &nbsp;the &nbsp;proportion &nbsp;of &nbsp;people &nbsp;who &nbsp;suffer &nbsp;from &nbsp;hunger&rdquo;. &nbsp; 
 
International aid agency procurement has a role to play in the eradication of poverty, by 
providing capital investment through local and regional sourcing strategies in the respective 
economies. By ensuring that supplier sourcing takes place in the countries and regions where the 
outcome of the procurement function is to occur procurement is able to influence: 
 
 job creation opportunities 
 increases in income 
 capacity in spend categories 
 advances in economic opportunity within communities 
 contribution toward economic development.

<p> 
Governance 
The procurement function plays an important role in achieving and ensuring good governance. It 
is an integral component &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;government&rsquo;s &nbsp;capacity &nbsp;to &nbsp;provide &nbsp;the &nbsp;required &nbsp;goods &nbsp;and &nbsp;services. &nbsp;
A well functioning procurement system ensures; better value for money, increased efficiency and 
effectiveness of delivery, reduces the potential for corruption, positive impact on a &nbsp;country&rsquo;s &nbsp;
investment climate, non-discriminatory practices, transparency and accountability. Good 
governance encompasses a functioning regulatory system, as well as institutional set-up, well 
designed processes and proven capacity. Strategic approaches to procurement, as well as the 
knowledge transfer of good procurement practice and capacity building within procurement 
functions toward National government procurement entities assist in the development of good 
governance practices. 
 
 
Benefits, barriers and drivers 
 
Benefits 
The main benefits from sustainable procurement can be summarized as follows: 
 
 controlling costs by adopting a wider approach to whole life costs 
 achieving internal and external standards 
 complying with environmental and social legislation 
 managing risk and reputation of the organization 
 creating new, vibrant markets 
 ensuring security of sustainable supply for the future 
 ensuring maximum community and financial benefits. 
 
Barriers 
The main barriers to achieving sustainable procurement appear to be: 
 
 habit and the difficulty in changing procurement behaviour 
 lack of suppliers of sustainable assets, suppliers or services 
 complexity of comparing costing/value for money assessments 
 the difficulty of including factors broader than environmental considerations 
 a perception that the process and outcomes are more costly or time consuming. 
 
Drivers 
The main drivers towards achieving sustainable procurement are: 
 
 effective organization wide policies to ensure that everyone is aware of the strategy 
 training and guidance to help all of those involved in procurement to understand sustainable 
</p>
<p>procurement and whole life costing; 
 regular audits and monitoring to assess where your organization is in the context of sustainable 
</p>
<p>procurement and where you could make further progress in this area 
 commitment to sustainable development as an organizational policy 
 supporting and educating suppliers/creating markets 
 linking up with other organizations to learn from their experience 
 pooling procurement by forming procurement consortium where relevant.

Sustainable procurement in the procurement process  
 
The sustainable procurement process does not differ greatly from the traditional procurement 
process. It incorporates an initial stage to determine the effect of the procurement action in terms 
of a desired outcome that is both environmentally and socially benign, as well as an additional 
stage at the end of the process to monitor and assess, and if need be adjust the net effect of the 
desired outcome. Other sustainable interventions are incorporated throughout the various stages 
of the procurement process. Each of these stages is summarized in the following table and 
further in the text examined below.   
 
Stage Description 
1 Planning and needs assessment of a procurement activity. 
2 Planning the requirement. 
3 Requirement definition. 
4 Sourcing. 
5 Solicitation 
6 Evaluation and contracting. 
7 Monitor and control. 
8 Monitor &nbsp;and &nbsp;assess &nbsp;the &nbsp;desired &nbsp;&lsquo;outcome&rsquo; &nbsp;achieved. 
</p>
<p> 
Note: For further detail refer to the UNDP/IAPSO &nbsp;&lsquo;Sustainable &nbsp;Procurement Guide&rsquo;. 
 
Planning and needs assessment of a procurement activity 
Decisions are required on the sustainable outcome a procurement process is meant to achieve; 
these are assisted by a number of analyses, such as a sustainable procurement risk assessment, 
supply market analyses, stakeholder analyses, demand analyses, etc. The type of analyses used 
and the decisions will depend upon the sustainability issue(s) that may be affected by the 
procurement action.  
 
Planning the requirement 
Procurement planning involves the transformation of a stated requirement or organizational goals 
and objectives into measurable activities to be used to plan, budget and manage the procurement 
function within the organization.  As with the traditional procurement process, procurement 
planning and forecasting is vitally important to ensure an effective, efficient, strategically viable 
and sustainable result.  
 
Requirement definition 
Developing and using generic specifications is as import in the sustainable procurement process 
as it is in the traditional procurement process. During this stage, human/labour rights and 
environmental performance criteria should be translated into specifications that meet specific 
requirements of the specified outcome, desired by the procurement action. 
 
The specification stage is key to all types of contract. Building in environmental and social 
considerations at this early stage, provides a clear indication to suppliers that sustainability is 
important to the UN organization. Consider available alternatives which are less environmentally 
and &nbsp;socially &nbsp;damaging. &nbsp;Consider &nbsp;all &nbsp;the &nbsp;phases &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;product&rsquo;s &nbsp;life &nbsp;cycle &nbsp;(e.g. &nbsp;production, &nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>transportation, maintenance, disposal, etc) when determining its cost and environmental impact. 
Assess the overall environmental and social integrity of suppliers by looking at their policies and 
practices.  
The table below provides some examples of criteria to consider when determining potential 
environmental and social impacts of goods , services and works2: during the requirement 
definition stage.  
 
Criteria Factors to consider 
Environmental 
Fit for the purpose and 
provide value for money 
</p>
<p>Ensure that the product you are considering does the job you 
want it to do for all potential users, including groups with 
specialist needs where appropriate. 
</p>
<p>Biodegradability Some products may be suitable for composting. Where that is 
the case, ensure that the materials can break down speedily and 
safely. 
</p>
<p>Design for disassembly When products are made up of thousands of different types of 
materials, particularly plastics and metals, it helps if they are 
designed to be easily taken apart or disassembled so that the 
materials can be recycled. This is particularly relevant to 
electronic and electrical products such as fridges, televisions, 
personal computers and printers. 
</p>
<p>Minimum use of virgin and 
non-renewable materials 
</p>
<p>Wherever possible, the use of recycled or re-used materials 
should be encouraged, as these generally have a much lower 
impact on the environment. Examples include computer 
processor cases or road aggregate. 
</p>
<p>Resource, energy and water 
efficiency 
</p>
<p>Running costs are often overlooked when procuring products. 
Seek equipment that is energy efficient, such as Energy Star 
rated products. Also check that your product does not have a 
&lsquo;knock-on&rsquo; &nbsp;effect &nbsp;of &nbsp;using &nbsp;more &nbsp;resources, &nbsp;eg &nbsp;specifying &nbsp;paper &nbsp;
towels over hand-driers may increase the volume of paper you 
dispose of, which also has a cost. 
</p>
<p>Fault controls to prevent 
unnecessary waste 
</p>
<p>When specifying plant equipment, such as boilers, ensure that 
you specify metering and monitoring equipment. Whilst it might 
increase acquisition costs it will alert you to inefficient use and 
enable you to reduce running costs, spills or waste problems. 
</p>
<p>Maximum durability, 
reparability, reusability, 
recyclability and 
upgradeability 
</p>
<p>Essentially this is a quality issue. Seek long-life products, that 
will survive being mistreated, that can be repaired, reused and 
ultimately recycled. Importantly, seek products that enable you 
to upgrade them and improve performance over time rather than 
having to buy new equipment to do the same job. 
</p>
<p>Minimum packaging Most products are bought with excessive levels of packaging, 
either to add cosmetic value, or to enable the product to survive 
poor handling. Packaging has to be disposed of once it has 
performed its task, and in most cases the cost of disposal falls to 
the customer, not the supplier. 
</p>
<p>Maximum use of post-
consumer materials 
</p>
<p>There are many grades of recycled materials. Where possible 
seek materials that have been used once and are being reused to 
perform a repeat or new function, rather than materials that have

<p>Criteria Factors to consider 
been reused from a manufacturing process waste which has 
never been used by the consumer. 
</p>
<p>No (or reduced) polluting 
with minimum use of toxic 
chemicals, CFCs, ozone and 
other pollutants. 
</p>
<p>Not only do these products help reduce your environmental 
impact, but choosing low-polluting alternatives often means you 
can avoid lengthy COSHH assessments and training, e.g. 
cleaning staff or lab technicians. 
</p>
<p>Social criteria 
Health and safety standards These should never be overlooked and it is sensible to evaluate 
</p>
<p>many products with a qualified health and safety officer. 
Examples include electrical equipment, vehicles, cleaning 
chemicals and furniture. 
</p>
<p>Local production Sourcing your purchases from local suppliers means that the 
economic benefits can be felt in the communities in which you 
live and work. This inward investment can help ensure the 
ongoing economic sustainability of your local area through job 
creation. 
</p>
<p>Ethically sourced You should seek to ensure that the products you buy are not 
exploiting child labour, or labour and economies in the 
developing world and that you meet recognised fair trade 
standards wherever possible. 
</p>
<p> 
The specification of a particular sustainable requirement may occasionally result in a purchase 
that costs more than a less sustainable preferable product or service, even after taking account of 
whole-life &nbsp;costs. &nbsp;There &nbsp;is &nbsp;no &nbsp;reason &nbsp;why &nbsp;this &nbsp;extra &nbsp;cost &nbsp;can&rsquo;t &nbsp;be &nbsp;justified on sustainable grounds, 
although care should be taken to ensure that a proper balance is struck between the cost and the 
perceived sustainable benefits. A justification of higher acquisition costs can be made through 
longer-term paybacks, or because your organization has made equally valid commitments to 
reducing &nbsp;waste &nbsp;to &nbsp;landfill &nbsp;or &nbsp;CO2 &nbsp;emissions, &nbsp;for &nbsp;example. &nbsp;Buying &nbsp;&lsquo;future-proof&rsquo; &nbsp;equipment &nbsp;that &nbsp;
will meet future sustainable standards can have significant long-term financial benefits, even if 
the acquisition cost may have seemed comparatively high. 
 
There are a number of tools and approaches that can be used to determine the requirement 
criteria, these range from various standards, industry agreements, labels and approaches such as 
life cycle costing. For detailed &nbsp;information &nbsp;on &nbsp;these &nbsp;please &nbsp;refer &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;&lsquo;Sustainable &nbsp;Procurement &nbsp;
Guide&rsquo;. 
 
Sourcing 
Supplier sourcing and evaluation strategy enables the procurement function to address gender 
and empowerment as well as poverty eradication issues. This can be achieved by including 
suppliers from identified minority groups and/or from specific geographic and demographic 
regions and ensuring local content and representation in the bidding process. 
 
These environmental and social issues can be considered during supplier pre-qualification 
exercises. If assessment shows that the majority of impacts are in the raw materials stage, the 
focus &nbsp;should &nbsp;be &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;own &nbsp;environmental &nbsp;supply &nbsp;chain &nbsp;management &nbsp;policies. &nbsp;If &nbsp;the &nbsp;
impacts are in the manufacturing stage, then the &nbsp;focus &nbsp;should &nbsp;be &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;environmental &nbsp;
management system for their business.

</p>
<p>A &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;environmental &nbsp;performance &nbsp;should &nbsp;be &nbsp;one &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;key &nbsp;criteria &nbsp;used &nbsp;in &nbsp;supplier &nbsp;
selection. &nbsp;Equally, &nbsp;where &nbsp;relevant, &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;approach &nbsp;to &nbsp;managing &nbsp;its social impacts should 
also form part of the assessment. When reviewing the response to any questionnaire, of 
particular &nbsp;importance &nbsp;is &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;supplier&rsquo;s &nbsp;environmental &nbsp;and &nbsp;social &nbsp;policies &nbsp;actually &nbsp;address &nbsp;the &nbsp;
key impacts of their business. For example an environmental policy from a chemical 
manufacturer needs to deal with the environmental issues of making chemicals rather than 
looking at its paper consumption and car policy, which whilst valid are not the main impacts of 
this business.  
 
For a sample questionnaire and assessment procedures please refer to Annex 5. 
 
Solicitation 
Solicitation documents should incorporate sustainability specifications and requirements 
designed in the previous stages. Potential suppliers must then be able to show they are able to 
meet those requirements. 
 
Evaluation and contracting 
The evaluation and contracting stage makes use of the standard evaluation methods; however, it 
should place specific emphasis on use of weighted and ranked criteria incorporating the specific 
performance criteria and specifications that address sustainable procurement factors. The 
evaluation process should also include a risk analysis, a cost analysis and modelling and a life 
cycle analysis (cradle to grave) particularly if the procurement process features environmentally 
sensitive issues. 
 
Sustainability evaluation criteria 
Assessment of a tender is a key part of the procurement process. The degree to which tenders are 
scored is dependent upon a number of factors. Tender assessment is the opportunity to go into 
more specific detail about how the supplier is going to deliver the requirements from a cost, 
quality and sustainability perspective. Through risk assessment, sustainability criteria may have 
been set that are so important that a supplier must have them in order to bid, typically these are 
addressed through the specification and are considered as pass/ fail criteria. Items that are 
important but not vital are dealt with through asking the supplier for information that is then 
scored, called sustainability criteria. 
 
Sustainability evaluation criteria are key to undertaking thorough and consistent assessments of 
sustainability &nbsp;performance &nbsp;of &nbsp;suppliers&rsquo; &nbsp;bids &nbsp;and &nbsp;proposals. &nbsp;UN &nbsp;organizations &nbsp;should &nbsp;determine &nbsp;
environmental evaluation criteria to suit their own needs. Some recommended environmental 
evaluation criteria to consider in tenders are: 
 
 Air pollution - to include measures taken to reduce emissions, particularly of key pollutants, 
</p>
<p>and looking at efforts to exceed statutory requirements. 
 Biodiversity and habitats - a specific aspect of land use, where biodiversity and important 
</p>
<p>habitats are recognised and measures taken to protect and enhance them. 
 Climate change - measures taken to monitor and reduce greenhouse gas emissions should be 
</p>
<p>highlighted in this criterion. 
 Resource use and intensity - to include energy, water, raw materials and land as resources, 
</p>
<p>and to focus on the efficiency of their use. Linked to waste, air pollution and water pollution. 
 Transport - to consider measures that reduce overall transport requirements, and to encourage 
</p>
<p>a modal shift away from road transport (people and freight). 
 Waste - to include measures to reduce, re-use and recycle wastes. </p>

<p> Water quality - to include measures to reduce discharges, particularly of key pollutants, and 
looking at efforts to exceed statutory requirements, and rewarding efforts to meet water quality 
objectives and targets.

Sustainable &nbsp;Procurement&rsquo;. 
 
Monitor and control  
This &nbsp;stage &nbsp;involves &nbsp;monitoring &nbsp;suppliers&rsquo; &nbsp;performance &nbsp;throughout &nbsp;the &nbsp;contracting &nbsp;period, &nbsp;
meeting delivery deadlines and setting quality standards as well as installation, after sales 
services and warranty provisions.  Where sustainability criteria have been set, these should be 
monitored during this stage. 
 
Monitor &nbsp;and &nbsp;assess &nbsp;the &nbsp;desired &nbsp;&lsquo;outcome&rsquo; &nbsp;achieved 
The final stage of the sustainable procurement process, is measuring the results against the 
outcome that was initially set.  The results and lessons learned should then be fed back into stage 
one. The outcome may be difficult to measure, or may need to be measured in intervals over a 
certain time period. Specific indicators may also need to be developed to facilitate meaningful 
measures. 
 
Conclusion - environmental and social criteria 
 
While the concept of sustainable procurement is becoming more widely accepted and practised 
in the private sector as well as the international public sector, it is still relatively new with its 
origins only emerging &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;mid &nbsp;1990&rsquo;s. &nbsp;As &nbsp;such, &nbsp;it &nbsp;is &nbsp;an &nbsp;approach &nbsp;that &nbsp;is &nbsp;under &nbsp;constant &nbsp;
development. What began as green procurement incorporating only environmental product 
criteria has grown to encompass social performance criteria as well as economic goals to further 
the notion of sustainable development.  The limited literature available on sustainable 
procurement is often weighted towards environmental aspects of sustainable procurement, as the 
social aspects of sustainable procurement are not yet as well developed.  
 
Product and company environmental performance are readily quantifiable and measurable, but 
social aspects relating to human rights and labour standards are more difficult to include as 
quantifiable requirements within solicitation documents. Progress is however being made, 
standards such as the SA 8000 provide procurement officers with a means of integrating 
complex social issue criteria while providing a means to verify claims made by prospective 
suppliers. As more companies subscribe and abide by standards and agreements such as the 
Global Compact, ISO 14001, EMAS, SA 8000, OHSAS 18001, etc. the more readily the 
principles and criteria outlined by these will be able to be integrated into biding documentation 
and processes. 
 
Another important factor to consider in the implementation of sustainable procurement is the 
nature of the sector where it is being implemented, for instance, it is no great surprise that the 
advancement of sustainable procurement is greatest within the private  and in some countries the 
local and national governmental sector. It is here where changes to procurement policy are 
relatively easily integrated and adopted. Within the intergovernmental sector such as the UN 
system of organizations, implementation of sustainable procurement criteria and processes 
becomes more complex, primarily due to the existing rules and regulations governing 
competitive bidding particularly on an international basis. Implementing changes to a 
procurement system that can be seen as favouring suppliers from particular countries or regions </p>

</p>
<p>simply because they are further advanced in the environmental and social performance proves to 
be a very difficult proposition. It is at this point that the integration of sustainable procurement 
has thus far been stilted within the UN procurement system. Work is however continuing to 
overcome this impasse.

</p>

staff members 
</p>
<p> The Secretary-General, pursuant to the request of the General Assembly in 
paragraph 8 of its resolution 52/252 of 8 September 1998, and in order to assist staff 
members in understanding their status, basic rights and duties as set out in the text

standards of conduct&rdquo;), to replace the 1954 report of the International Civil Service 
Advisory Board entitled Standards of Conduct in the International Civil Service

<p> 
</p>
<p>ST/SGB/2002/13  
</p>
<p> I. Introduction 
 
 
</p>
<p>1. Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations establishes the 
universal standard for all staff members employed by the United Nations as the 
&ldquo;highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity&rdquo;. It is thus axiomatic that 
these standards apply to all staff whose employment relationship derives from the 
authority vested by the Charter in the Organization to employ individuals as staff 
members. These basic standards are common to all staff, including those of the 
separately funded and administered organs. The revised text of article I of the Staff 
Regulations, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 52/252 of 8 
September 1998, and of chapter I of the 100 series of the Staff Rules, noted in that 
same resolution, express in concrete terms the basic rights and obligations of staff 
members. 
</p>
<p>2. The statutory provisions set out in the present annex are an integral part of the 
Staff Regulations and Rules, with regulations being adopted by the General 
Assembly pursuant to Article 101, paragraph 1, of the Charter and with rules being 
promulgated by the Secretary-General pursuant to the authority granted to him or 
her by the scope and purpose provision of the Staff Regulations. 
</p>
<p>3. As the Staff Regulations apply to all staff, including the separately funded 
organs, the Secretary-General has amended the 200 series (Project personnel) and 
the 300 series (Short-term appointments and appointments of limited duration) of 
the Staff Rules to bring them into line with the 100 series. 
</p>
<p>4. The provisions of article I of the Staff Regulations are in most parts very 
general as they must apply to all staff. Similarly, the provisions of chapter I of the 
100 series of the Staff Rules contained in the present annex are, for the most part, 
very general as they must apply to all staff appointed under the 100 series of the 
Staff Rules. Pursuant to the request of the General Assembly in resolution 52/252, it 
is envisaged that additional rules for particular groups of staff such as finance 
officers, procurement officers and staff of separately funded organs will be prepared 
and promulgated by administrative issuances dealing with their status, rights and 
obligations. It is not appropriate to deal with such specialized matters in the Staff 
Regulations and Rules. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Role of the commentary 
 
 
</p>
<p>5. Each provision of the Staff Regulations and Rules set out in the present annex 
is followed by a commentary. The commentary is designed to explain individual 
provisions and to help staff members understand each provision by placing it into 
context. It is not part of the Staff Regulations and Rules and so is not a legal &ldquo;norm&rdquo; 
or imperative, nor does it have the legal force of a rule. It is, however, an official 
guide published by the Secretary-General for the use of management and staff on 
the scope and application of the rules contained in this annex. Staff may thus safely 
rely on the commentary to guide their actions since management will use it in 
interpreting and applying those rules. The commentary will be updated from time to 
time in consultation with representatives of the staff in the Staff-Management 
Coordination Committee established under chapter VIII of the Staff Rules in the 
light of experience in applying the rules to specific instances.

</p>
<p>6. In view of the importance of the revised text of article I of the Staff 
Regulations adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 52/252 and of chapter I 
of the 100 series of the Staff Rules noted in the same resolution, and in view of the 
need for staff to have a guide to their status, rights and duties conveniently at hand, 
the present annex contains extracts from the Charter and the Convention on the 
Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the text of article I of the Staff 
Regulations and the text of the related provisions of chapter I of the Staff Rules, 
together with the explanatory commentary, as well as the text of resolution 52/252 
and of the &ldquo;Standards of conduct for the international civil service&rdquo; adopted by the 
International Civil Service Commission in 2001 and welcomed by the General 
Assembly in its resolution 56/244 (the 2001 standards of conduct).  
 
 
</p>
<p>  Status of the &ldquo;Standards of conduct for the international  
civil service&rdquo;  
 
 
</p>
<p>7. The standards of conduct adopted in 2001 revised and updated the 1954 report 
of the International Civil Service Advisory Board entitled Standards of Conduct in 
the International Civil Service in order to assist staff members and executive heads 
of the organizations to understand better the obligations placed on staff conduct by 
the Charter and the Staff Regulations and Rules. The 1954 report has been 
continually cited by successive Secretaries-General and by the United Nations 
Administrative Tribunal when assessing conduct of staff. The revised text is 
reproduced in the present annex as an illustrative guide to expected standards of 
conduct. The standards of conduct do not have the force of law as they provide a 
discussion of expected standards to help staff understand their role as international 
civil servants rather than a set of binding rules. References to relevant paragraphs in 
the standards of conduct are made in the commentary.

<p> The General Assembly, 
</p>
<p> Recalling Articles 97, 98, 100, 101 and 105 of the Charter of the United 
Nations, 
</p>
<p> Recalling also its resolution 52/12 B of 19 December 1997, 
</p>
<p> Noting with concern the limited time it had at its disposal to consider this 
matter, 
</p>
<p> Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General of 17 October 1997a 
and 28 July 1998b entitled &ldquo;Proposed United Nations Code of Conduct&rdquo;,

and their dependent children, including any substantial transfers of assets and 
property to spouses and dependent children from the staff member or from any 
other source that might constitute a conflict of interest, after knowledge of the 
appointment or during its tenure, to provide certification stating that there is 
no conflict of interest with regard to the economic activities of spouses and 
dependent children, and to assist the Secretary-General in verifying the above-
mentioned certification on his special request. The financial disclosure 
statements will remain confidential and will only be used, as prescribed by the 
Secretary-General, in making determinations pursuant to staff regulation

</p>
<p> 7. Requests the Secretary-General to emphasize in the commentary on new 
article I of the Staff Regulations and chapter I of the 100 series of the Staff Rules

<p> The Secretariat shall comprise a Secretary-General and such staff as the 
Organization may require. The Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General 
Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. He shall be the chief 
administrative officer of the Organization. 
 
</p>
<p>  Article 98 
 
</p>

<p>  Article 100 
 
</p>

determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity of securing the 
highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. Due regard shall be paid 
to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.

<p>  Commentary 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Staff members 
 
</p>
<p>1. The Charter requires that staff members be &ldquo;appointed&rdquo; by the Secretary-
General (or by those to whom this power has been delegated, either by the 
Secretary-General alone or by the Secretary-General at the direction of the General 
Assembly). The hallmark of a staff relationship is &ldquo;appointment&rdquo;, and this is done 
through a letter of appointment pursuant to staff regulation 4.1. The Staff 
Regulations, as revised by the General Assembly in its resolution 52/252, apply to 
all staff members of the Secretariat, within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter, 
whose employment relationship and contractual link with the Organization are 
through a letter of appointment issued pursuant to regulations promulgated by the 
General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>2. To ensure that the revised Regulations apply to all staff members of the 
Organization, including all staff members of all its principal and subsidiary organs, 
even those with entirely separate administrations, the following sentence has been 
inserted between the second and third sentence of the &ldquo;Scope and purpose&rdquo; 
provision of the Staff Regulations: 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;For the purposes of these Regulations, the expressions &lsquo;United Nations 
Secretariat&rsquo;, &lsquo;staff members&rsquo; or &lsquo;staff &rsquo; shall refer to all the staff members of the 
Secretariat, within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter of the United 
Nations, whose employment and contractual relationship are defined by a 
letter of appointment subject to regulations promulgated by the General 
Assembly pursuant to Article 101, paragraph 1, of the Charter.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>The entire text is shown in section IV of the present annex. 
</p>
<p>3. Article 105 of the Charter empowers the General Assembly to make provisions 
for the privileges and immunities of the &ldquo;officials&rdquo; of the Organization. The 
Assembly did so by adopting the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the 
United Nations on 13 February 1946 (hereafter the &ldquo;General Convention&rdquo;). Article 
V of the General Convention provides for privileges and immunities for officials and 
article VII provides for the issue of United Nations laissez-passers to officials. By its 
resolution 76 (I) of 7 December 1946, the Assembly approved that the provisions in 
articles V and VII of the General Convention apply to all staff members of the 
United Nations with the exception of those &ldquo;recruited locally and assigned to hourly

Organization.

<p> IV. Scope and purpose of the Staff Regulations of the  
United Nations  
 
 
</p>
<p>  Article I of the Staff Regulations of the United Nations and related 
rules from chapter I of the 100 series of the Staff Rules, with 
commentary 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Staff Regulations of the United Nations 
Scope and purpose 
 
 
</p>
<p> The Staff Regulations embody the fundamental conditions of service and the 
basic rights, duties and obligations of the United Nations Secretariat. They represent 
the broad principles of personnel policy for the staffing and administration of the 
Secretariat. For the purposes of these Regulations, the expressions &ldquo;United Nations 
Secretariat&rdquo;, &ldquo;staff members&rdquo; or &ldquo;staff&rdquo; shall refer to all the staff members of the 
Secretariat, within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations, 
whose employment and contractual relationship are defined by a letter of 
appointment subject to regulations promulgated by the General Assembly pursuant 
to Article 101, paragraph 1, of the Charter. The Secretary-General, as the chief 
administrative officer, shall provide and enforce such staff rules consistent with 
these principles as he or she considers necessary.

Status of staff 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.1 (a) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members are international civil servants. Their responsibilities as staff 
members are not national but exclusively international. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. It should be noted that the commentary uses the word &ldquo;former&rdquo; to refer to the 
regulations and rules in force when General Assembly resolution 52/252 was 
adopted (ST/SGB/1998/8 and ST/SGB/Staff Rules/1/9 and Amend.1). The word 
&ldquo;new&rdquo; is used to indicate language that was not in the former Staff Regulations and 
Rules. 
</p>
<p>2. Staff regulation 1.1 (a) essentially reproduces the text of the first two sentences 
of former staff regulation 1.1 (see paras. 3-14, 29 and 30 of the 2001 standards of 
conduct), reproduced in section V of the present annex.

</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.1 (b) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members shall make the following written declaration witnessed by the 
Secretary-General or his or her authorized representative: 
</p>
<p>  &ldquo;I solemnly declare and promise to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and 
conscience the functions entrusted to me as an international civil servant of the 
United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the 
interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept 
instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government 
or other source external to the Organization.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>  &ldquo;I also solemnly declare and promise to respect the obligations 
incumbent upon me as set out in the Staff Regulations and Rules.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.1 (b) contains the declaration of office of staff and its 
opening words incorporate the text of former staff regulation 1.9 insofar as it relates 
to staff members (see paras. 3-14 of the 2001 standards of conduct). The first part of 
staff regulation 1.1 (b) in substance reproduces the text of the declaration set out in 
former staff regulation 1.9, except that staff regulation 1.1 (b) codifies existing 
practice under which staff members subscribe to a written declaration but do not 
make a sworn statement, since the concept of a sworn statement depends upon the 
operation of local law. 
</p>
<p>2. The second paragraph of the declaration is new and refers specifically to the 
Staff Regulations and Rules. 
</p>
<p>3. A copy of the present bulletin and its annex will be distributed to all new and 
current staff members. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.1 (c) 
 
</p>
<p> The Secretary-General shall ensure that the rights and duties of staff members, 
as set out in the Charter and the Staff Regulations and Rules and in the relevant 
resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly, are respected. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.1 (c) is new. 
</p>
<p>2. The regulation codifies an implicit duty that falls on the Secretary-General, 
that is, to ensure that the rights and duties of staff members are respected. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.1 (d) 
 
</p>
<p> The Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that the paramount consideration in 
the determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity of securing staff 
of the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.1 (d) places on the Secretary-General an affirmative duty to 
seek to ensure that the criteria set out in Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter 
for the determination of the conditions of service of the staff are implemented. This

</p>
<p>provision is not intended to affect the role of legislative bodies involved in the 
process of establishing conditions of service. It does, however, seek to formulate the 
responsibility of the Secretary-General to advocate, in the appropriate forums, the 
adoption of what he or she considers to be the appropriate conditions of service to 
secure the recruitment and retention of staff possessing the highest standards of 
efficiency, competence and integrity. 
</p>
<p>2. The salaries of staff in the Professional category and above are determined by 
reference to the best paying national civil service under what is known as the 
Noblemaire principle. The salaries of staff in the General Service and related 
categories are established by the Secretary-General on the basis of the best 
prevailing conditions of employment in the locality where the United Nations office 
concerned is located under what is commonly referred to as the Flemming principle. 
The determination of the conditions of service of staff in the Field Service category 
follows the same pattern as the Professional category. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.1 (e) 
 
</p>
<p> The Staff Regulations apply to all staff at all levels, including staff of the 
separately funded organs and staff holding appointments under the 100, 200 and 300 
series of the Staff Rules. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Regulation 1.1 (e) makes clear that the Staff Regulations apply to all staff 
members of the Secretariat within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter whose 
contractual link with the Organization is through a letter of appointment issued 
pursuant to regulations promulgated by the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>2. While the Staff Regulations apply to all staff, applicable Staff Rules differ 
depending on the type of appointment held by the staff member. The 100 series of the 
Staff Rules applies to all staff except those engaged on technical assistance projects 
(200 series) and staff engaged for short-term service or for appointments of limited 
duration (300 series). Similar amendments to the 200 series and 300 series rules 
have been promulgated as appear in the 100 series, with appropriate modifications 
required to address the different circumstances of such staff. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.1 (f) 
 
</p>
<p> The privileges and immunities enjoyed by the United Nations by virtue of 
Article 105 of the Charter are conferred in the interests of the Organization. These 
privileges and immunities furnish no excuse to the staff members who are covered 
by them to fail to observe laws and police regulations of the State in which they are 
located nor do they furnish an excuse for non-performance of their private 
obligations. In any case where an issue arises regarding the application of these 
privileges and immunities, the staff member shall immediately report the matter to 
the Secretary-General, who alone may decide whether such privileges and 
immunities exist and whether they shall be waived in accordance with the relevant 
instruments.

<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.1 (f) essentially reproduces the substance of former staff 
regulation 1.8 (see the 2001 standards of conduct, paras. 39 and 40). It is placed at 
the end of staff regulation 1.1 as it defines the scope and extent of the privileges and 
immunities of the United Nations that are enjoyed by staff in the interest of the 
Organization. 
</p>
<p>2. Staff rule 101.2 (c) deals with the obligations on staff to honour their private 
legal obligations. 
 
</p>
<p>  Staff rule 101.1 
Status of staff 
 
</p>
<p> The declaration made by a staff member on appointment shall be placed in his 
or her official status file. A new declaration shall be made after a break in service 
that exceeds three months. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff rule 101.1 codifies the existing practice of placing written declarations in 
the official status file. The second sentence seeks to ensure that a new declaration is 
made after a break in service that exceeds three months unless the staff member is 
reinstated and the staff member&rsquo;s services are considered continuous under current 
staff rule 104.3 (b). 
</p>
<p>2. The Staff Regulations adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 
52/252 entered into force on 1 January 1999. They are binding on all staff in service 
on that date, as well as staff recruited on or after that date. The declaration 
previously made by staff already in service on 1 January 1999 at the time of their 
entry on duty remains in effect. Thus, it is not necessary that they sign the new 
declaration set out in staff regulation 1.1 (b).

Basic rights and obligations of staff

<p>  Core values 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.2 (a) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members shall uphold and respect the principles set out in the Charter, 
including faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human 
person and in the equal rights of men and women. Consequently, staff members 
shall exhibit respect for all cultures; they shall not discriminate against any 
individual or group of individuals or otherwise abuse the power and authority vested 
in them. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p> This provision describes the basic values expected of international civil 
servants because of their status. At the heart of those values are the principles set 
out in the preamble to the Charter. The first sentence is a quotation from those 
opening words and the second sentence is the obligation on staff flowing from a

<p>commitment to those values (see also the 2001 standards of conduct, paras. 2, 3, 6, 
13, 14, 20 and 36). 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.2 (b) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members shall uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence 
and integrity. The concept of integrity includes, but is not limited to, probity, 
impartiality, fairness, honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting their work and 
status. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. This provision describes more basic values expected of international civil 
servants because of their status. It is derived from Article 101, paragraph 3, of the 
Charter and affirmatively places on staff the obligation to uphold the highest 
standards of efficiency, competence and integrity after appointment to the 
Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>2. At the heart of those values is integrity, allied with a dedication to the values 
and principles set out in the Charter. As discussed in paragraph 5 of the 2001 
standards of conduct, the concept of integrity &ldquo;embraces all aspects of behaviour of 
an international civil servant, including such qualities as honesty, truthfulness, 
impartiality and incorruptibility&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>3. Various other provisions deal with particular manifestations of this set of basic 
values in different circumstances, for example, staff regulations 1.2 (d) to (i), (m) 
and (n). 
 
</p>
<p>  General rights and obligations 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.2 (c) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and to 
assignment by him or her to any of the activities or offices of the United Nations. In 
exercising this authority the Secretary-General shall seek to ensure, having regard to 
the circumstances, that all necessary safety and security arrangements are made for 
staff carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to them. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. The opening sentence of staff regulation 1.2 (c) reproduces the first sentence of 
former staff regulation 1.2. 
</p>
<p>2. The obligations of Member States for the security of staff are set out in Article 
105 of the Charter, which provides that the Organization and its officials shall enjoy 
such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the exercise of their functions. 
</p>
<p>3. The Secretary-General, as chief administrative officer, has an inherent 
responsibility to seek to ensure the safety of staff. This regulation recognizes that 
responsibility as a basic right of staff (see also the 2001 standards of conduct, 
para. 37). 
</p>
<p>4. In exercising his or her authority to assign staff to any of the activities of the 
Organization, the Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that, while assigned to

</p>
<p>hardship areas, staff are afforded reasonable conditions of life and work having 
regard to the existing conditions. 
</p>
<p>5. Furthermore, since staff are subject to assignment, measures should be taken 
to ensure that staff are properly advised, before departure, of conditions prevailing 
at the duty station to which they are assigned. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.2 (d) 
 
</p>
<p> In the performance of their duties staff members shall neither seek nor accept 
instructions from any Government or from any other source external to the 
Organization. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (d) reproduces the essence of former staff regulation 1.3 
and flows from the first sentence of Article 100, paragraph 1, of the Charter (see the 
2001 standards of conduct, paras. 8, 12 and 30). 
</p>
<p>2. The new regulation makes clear that directions or instructions to staff come 
from the Secretary-General, who must fulfil the legislative mandates of the 
Organization. This is true in all areas, including, for example, decisions relating to 
the appointment and promotion of staff, which are for the Secretary-General to 
make as chief administrative officer of the Organization. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.2 (e) 
 
</p>
<p> By accepting appointment, staff members pledge themselves to discharge their 
functions and regulate their conduct with the interests of the Organization only in 
view. Loyalty to the aims, principles and purposes of the United Nations, as set forth 
in its Charter, is a fundamental obligation of all staff members by virtue of their 
status as international civil servants. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. The first sentence of staff regulation 1.2 (e) sets out an idea that is in former 
staff regulation 1.1 and former staff regulation 1.9, which contains the oath or 
declaration of office, that is, that staff must regulate their conduct with only the 
interests of the Organization in view (see the 2001 standards of conduct, paras. 4 
and 5). The second sentence of staff regulation 1.2 (e) is new and focuses on the 
concept of loyalty to the aims, principles and purposes of the Organization as set 
out in the Charter (which is alluded to in the declaration contained in staff 
regulation 1.1 (b)) (ibid., paras. 4, 7 and 30). It was considered important to 
highlight those obligations which arise from the very status of a staff member and 
which, at present, are set out only in the declaration subscribed to by staff upon 
their entry on duty. 
</p>
<p>2. The Secretary-General, and those to whom he or she has delegated decision-
making authority, has the responsibility to make decisions as to whether the staff 
have complied with the provisions of the Staff Regulations and Rules. Since no set of 
rules, no matter how long or complex, can cover all situations, it is clear that there 
must be discretion in the application of the rules. This is common to all systems of 
administrative law. However, the discretionary authority of the Secretary-General is 
not unlimited and it has consistently been held by the Administrative Tribunal that 
</p>

 </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p> 
</p>
<p> ST/SGB/2002/13
</p>
<p>decisions cannot be tainted by prejudice, improper motive or mistake of fact. The 
Administrative Tribunal adjudicates claims by staff that decisions have not been 
properly taken. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.2 (f) 
 
</p>
<p> While staff members&rsquo; personal views and convictions, including their political 
and religious convictions, remain inviolable, staff members shall ensure that those 
views and convictions do not adversely affect their official duties or the interests of 
the United Nations. They shall conduct themselves at all times in a manner befitting 
their status as international civil servants and shall not engage in any activity that is 
incompatible with the proper discharge of their duties with the United Nations. They 
shall avoid any action and, in particular, any kind of public pronouncement that may 
adversely reflect on their status, or on the integrity, independence and impartiality 
that are required by that status. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (f) generally reproduces the essence of former staff 
regulation 1.4. The core idea of conduct befitting an international civil servant was 
considered by the International Civil Service Commission in 2001. The Commission 
indicated that: 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;&hellip; international civil servants have a special calling: to serve the ideals of 
peace, of respect for fundamental rights, of economic and social progress, and 
of international cooperation. It is therefore incumbent on international civil 
servants to adhere to the highest standards of conduct; for ultimately, it is the 
international civil service that will enable the United Nations system to bring 
about a just and peaceful world.&rdquo;g
</p>
<p>(See the 2001 standards of conduct, para. 2; see also para. 5 on the integrity 
expected of international civil servants; paras. 4, 7, 21 and 33 on loyalty; para. 6 
on tolerance and understanding; paras. 8-10 on impartiality; paras. 11 and 12 on 
independence; paras. 13 and 36 on international outlook; and para. 14 on freedom 
from discrimination.) 
</p>
<p>2. The first sentence of regulation 1.2 (f) is a revision of the second sentence in 
former staff regulation 1.4, which provided that: 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;While they are not expected to give up their national sentiments, or their 
political and religious convictions, they shall at all times comport themselves 
with the reserve and tact incumbent upon them by reason of their international 
status.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>The revision recasts this obligation in a more positive tone. In the 2001 standards of 
conduct, the Commission noted that: 
</p>
<p>  &ldquo;Impartiality implies tolerance and restraint, particularly in dealing with 
political or religious convictions. While their personal views remain inviolate, 
international civil servants do not have the freedom of private persons to take 
sides or to express their convictions publicly on controversial matters, either

</p>
<p>3. As noted in the commentary to regulation 1.2 (e), it is for the Secretary-
General to decide whether a staff member has met the standards set out in this 
provision. The Administrative Tribunal has consistently maintained that, while the 
Secretary-General has the responsibility and discretion to assess a staff member&rsquo;s 
conduct, such discretion must be exercised reasonably, without improper motives 
and in accordance with the requirements of due process.

</p>
<p> Staff members shall not use their office or knowledge gained from their

they do not favour. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (g) builds on ideas in former staff regulation 1.5 and 
codifies principles set out in the 2001 standards of conduct (see paras. 21, 22, 25 
and 34). The use of one&rsquo;s office for personal gain is clearly unacceptable. This 
includes not only conducting business from a United Nations office, but also such 
things as using the United Nations facilities for a business, using the United Nations 
name, logo or address for a business or approving a contract for a family business 
without disclosure. It also reflects the principle set out in former staff regulation 1.5 
that staff members shall not use information that has not been made public for the 
private advantage of the staff member or any third party. 
</p>
<p>2. Staff regulation 1.2 (g), for the sake of clarity, makes specific reference to the 
prohibition on a staff member favouring a third party, including family or friends, 
from profiting from a staff member&rsquo;s position or the exercise of his or her functions. 
The term &ldquo;friends&rdquo; is broad and seeks to encompass not only friends as normally 
understood but also relationships that are not recognized by the Staff Regulations 
and Rules as creating a dependency. 
</p>
<p>3. The regulation also prohibits the use of office or knowledge gained from that 
office for personal reasons to prejudice or harm the careers of individual staff 
members or harm third parties. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.2 (h) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members may exercise the right to vote but shall ensure that their 
participation in any political activity is consistent with, and does not reflect 
adversely upon, the independence and impartiality required by their status as 
international civil servants.

<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (h) reproduces the essence of the text of former staff 
regulation 1.7 (see the 2001 standards of conduct, paras. 9, 10, 29, 44 and 45), but 
the provision is cast in a more positive form to ensure that the emphasis is on the 
need to ensure that political activities do not have an impact on the independence 
and impartiality of staff rather than suggesting that there is some problem with staff 
having political views. 
</p>
<p>2. The notion of consistency with the status of an international civil servant is to 
be determined by the Secretary-General in view of the necessity of staff being, and 
appearing to be, independent and impartial. Thus, it is clear that staff members 
cannot be candidates for political office. In case of doubt, inquiries could be made 
by staff pursuant to staff rule 101.2 (r). 
</p>
<p>3. Staff members, of course, have the right to form staff representative bodies in 
accordance with staff regulations 8.1 and 8.2 in order to ensure, in the words of staff 
regulation 8.1, &ldquo;the effective participation of staff in identifying, examining and 
resolving issues relating to staff welfare, including conditions of work, general 
conditions of life and other personnel policies&rdquo;. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.2 (i) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members shall exercise the utmost discretion with regard to all matters of 
official business. They shall not communicate to any Government, entity, person or 
any other source any information known to them by reason of their official position 
that they know or ought to have known has not been made public, except as 
appropriate in the normal course of their duties or by authorization of the Secretary-
General. These obligations do not cease upon separation from service. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (i) generally reproduces the text of former staff regulation 
1.5. The text reflects the fact that official information cannot be used for private 
purposes, except with authorization. This flows from the idea that staff members 
should place the interests of the Organization above their own (see the 2001 
standards of conduct, para. 4). It follows that permission must be obtained for 
disclosure to third parties of information that has not been made public, unless such 
disclosure is in the normal course of the staff member&rsquo;s duties, that is, that the staff 
member is either generally authorized to release information (for example, a press 
officer) or by a staff member specifically authorized to so do (see staff regulation 
1.2 (r) for the duty of staff to cooperate with United Nations investigations). 
</p>
<p>2. The last sentence of the regulation provides that the obligations contained in 
the provision do not cease upon separation from service. It may be difficult to 
enforce such a provision but, at the very least, if a former staff member ignores the 
regulation, a note could be placed in his or her official status file to prevent re-
employment.

</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.2 (j) 
 
</p>
<p> No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or 
remuneration from any Government. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulations 1.2 (j), (k), and (l) provide the basic provisions regulating the 
issue of acceptance by staff members of any honour, decoration, favour, gift or 
remuneration from outside sources (see the 2001 standards of conduct, paras. 46i 
and 47). 
</p>
<p>2. Former staff regulation 1.6 dealt with this issue in one provision, which 
prohibited the acceptance of any benefits from a Government, and severely 
restricted the acceptance of benefits from non-governmental sources. In proposing 
the language of staff regulation 1.2 (j), the Secretary-General believed that it would 
be appropriate for the General Assembly to stress the importance of the appearance 
of strict independence and impartiality of staff and thus to reaffirm the absolute 
prohibition on acceptance of benefits from Governments. The Secretary-General 
also believed that the prior exception in former staff regulation 1.6 and former staff 
rule 101.9 (b), which enabled a staff member to accept honours for war service 
prior to appointment with the United Nations, should be abolished. By General 
Assembly resolution 52/252, the Assembly abolished that exception. 
</p>
<p>3. Staff regulation 1.2 (j) contains the basic rule that staff may not accept any 
honour, decoration, gift or remuneration from any Government (ibid., paras. 46 and 
47).j This rule applies whatever the reason for the award, even if the award is 
unrelated to the staff member&rsquo;s service with the Organization, since it is imperative 
that an international civil servant be perceived as independent from any national 
Government. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.2 (k) 
 
</p>
<p> If refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration, favour or gift from a 
Government would cause embarrassment to the Organization, the staff member may 
receive it on behalf of the Organization and then report and entrust it to the 
Secretary-General, who will either retain it for the Organization or arrange for its 
disposal for the benefit of the Organization or for a charitable purpose. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (k) is new and seeks to regulate a recurrent problem, 
namely, when a staff member is given an unanticipated honour, decoration, favour 
or gift, perhaps in public, by a minister or even a head of State. In such cases, a

<p>__________________ 
</p>
<p> i Even though paragraph 46 envisages the possibility of authorization by the executive head of an 
organization of an honour, decoration, gift, favour or remuneration from a Government, this is 
precluded by staff regulation 1.2 (j), as explained in paras. 2 and 3 of the commentary. 
</p>
<p> j Staff regulation 3.4 (c) envisages that staff members may accept child benefits from their 
Governments but that, in such a case, United Nations dependency benefits will be reduced. The 
United Nations has also accepted housing from Governments and when staff are assigned to 
such housing, rental deductions from emoluments are applicable.

</p>
<p>public refusal could cause a needlessly unpleasant incident. In such cases, the new 
regulation states that the unanticipated honour, decoration, favour or gift may be 
received by the staff member, but on behalf of the United Nations. The honour, 
decoration, favour or gift must then be given to the Secretary-General for retention 
or disposal by the Organization. Remuneration from a Government must always be 
refused and such refusal, as staff are paid by the Organization, could hardly cause 
embarrassment. 
</p>
<p>2. The Secretary-General will write to all Member States to inform them of the 
Organization&rsquo;s policy on acceptance of honours, decorations, favours, gifts or 
remuneration so that incidents of this nature can be avoided to the largest extent 
possible. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.2 (l) 
 
</p>
<p> No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or 
remuneration from any non-governmental source without first obtaining the 
approval of the Secretary-General. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (l) requires that a staff member not accept any honour, 
decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from a non-governmental source without 
first obtaining the approval of the Secretary-General (see also the 2001 standards of 
conduct, paras. 46 and 47). This provision is based on former staff regulation 1.6.

<p> Staff members shall not be actively associated with the management of, or 
hold a financial interest in, any profit-making, business or other concern, if it were 
possible for the staff member or the profit-making, business or other concern to 
benefit from such association or financial interest by reason of his or her position 
with the United Nations. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (m) reproduces the essence of former staff rule 101.6 (b) 
and clarifies its scope. The provision was made a staff regulation because of its 
importance. Its purpose is to put staff on notice that they cannot be actively 
associated with a profit-making, business or other concern, if either the concern or 
the staff member is to profit by the association with the Organization. For example, 
a staff member working in the Office of Legal Affairs cannot act for outside clients 
(see also the 2001 standards of conduct, paras. 21 and 22). It will be for the 
Secretary-General to judge whether a particular act raises a conflict of interest 
situation. 
</p>
<p>2. This provision does not seek to affect the efforts of staff associations to raise 
funds for their activities from staff.

to the economic activities of spouses and dependent children, and to assist the

special request. The financial disclosure statements will remain confidential and will

<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (n) requires all staff at the assistant secretary-general level 
and above to submit financial disclosure statements on appointment and at intervals 
as prescribed by the Secretary-General (see also the 2001 standards of conduct, 
para. 22). This requirement is designed to minimize the risk of officials being 
perceived as using their position for personal gain. The regulation makes it clear 
that these financial disclosure statements will remain confidential and will only be 
used by the Secretary-General in assessing whether a conflict of interest situation 
exists. 
</p>
<p>2. Staff regulation 1.2 (n) also gives to the Secretary-General the authority to 
prescribe the form of such disclosure statements and the periodicity of their filing 
and authorizes him or her to establish procedures to ensure that the statements 
remain confidential.

<p>  Regulation 1.2 (o) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members shall not engage in any outside occupation or employment, 
whether remunerated or not, without the approval of the Secretary-General. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (o), which is based on former staff rule 101.6 (e), reflects 
the Organization&rsquo;s long-standing policy on outside occupation or employment, 
whether during or outside the work week (see also the 2001 standards of conduct, 
paras. 41-45).  
</p>
<p>2. The notion of occupation includes the practice of a profession (whether as an 
employee or an independent contractor). Employment is a legal relationship 
pursuant to which one person is providing work and skill at the control and 
direction of another.

</p>
<p> (ii) The outside occupation or employment is not against the interest of the 
United Nations; and 
</p>
<p> (iii) The outside occupation or employment is permitted by local law at the 
duty station or where the occupation or employment occurs. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (p) is new and sets out in specific terms the Organization&rsquo;s 
long-standing requirements that have to be met before a staff member may be given 
permission to engage in an outside occupation or employment. The key factors in 
determining whether permission should be granted relate to the compatibility of that 
occupation or employment with the status and functions being discharged by the 
staff member and with the interest of the United Nations (see also the 2001 
standards of conduct, para. 41). In addition, the occupation or employment must be 
permitted by local law. If the Secretary-General decides that permission for such 
occupation or employment should be denied, a reason will be given. 
</p>
<p>2. The first requirement is that there be no conflict with the staff member&rsquo;s 
official functions or with the staff member&rsquo;s status as an international civil servant. 
For example, it would not be appropriate for a member of the Office of Legal Affairs 
to be working part-time in an outside law firm. 
</p>
<p>3. The second requirement is that such occupation or employment not be against 
the interest of the United Nations, that is, that the occupation or employment does 
not reflect adversely upon the United Nations. For example, permission would not 
be granted for a staff member to work with an organization the goals of which are 
incompatible with those of the United Nations or to work in a capacity that could 
call into question the impartiality and independence of the staff member. 
</p>
<p>4. The third requirement is that the occupation or employment be permitted under 
the law of the duty station concerned. For example, in the United States of America, 
staff holding G-4 visas are not permitted under local law to accept outside 
employment, or to earn money from an occupation, so no permission would be 
granted. 
</p>
<p>5. It should be remarked that private non-remunerated activities that have 
nothing to do with a staff member&rsquo;s official functions would be at the discretion of 
the staff member (for example, the secretary of a stamp club) (see the 2001 
standards of conduct, para 38). 
</p>
<p>6. Private activities that relate to the United Nations are regulated by staff rule 
101.2 (p).

</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff regulation 1.2 (r) builds on the obligation to supply information set out in 
current staff rule 104.4. This provision seeks to ensure that staff members clearly 
understand that they must cooperate with official investigations by the Organization 
and must supply information on their official actions to, for example, the internal or 
external auditors. Such requests are not in the nature of criminal inquiries where an 
individual may refuse to answer on the basis of self-incrimination. The issue in the 
employment relationship between a staff member and the Organization is whether 
the highest standards of competence, efficiency and integrity have been met. 
</p>
<p>2. The Secretary-General has the authority to request staff to supply information 
and the staff have a duty to respond. This is without prejudice to the rights of staff 
under chapter X of the Staff Regulations and Rules. It should be noted that, although 
the Secretary-General obviously has control of United Nations premises, any 
investigations that involve the staff member&rsquo;s home would require the consent of the 
staff member or would have to be conducted by the appropriate authorities in 
accordance with national law. 
</p>
<p>3. If, after investigation, a staff member is charged with misconduct, the staff 
member is entitled to all the due process protections set out in the Staff Regulations 
and Rules and administrative issuances promulgated thereunder. This includes the 
freedom to decide whether the staff member wishes to make any statements or 
submissions in response to the charge.

</p>
<p> Staff rule 101.2 (a) is new. It will ensure that staff are held accountable 
through disciplinary procedures for failure to comply with their obligations and the 
standards of conduct, set out in the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff 
Regulations and Rules, the Financial Regulations and Rules and all related 
issuances. Administrative issuances refer to issuances promulgated by the 
Secretary-General, or by those who are delegated authority by the Secretary-
General, in furtherance of the Staff Regulations and Rules and the Financial 
Regulations and Rules (see ST/SGB/1997/1). 
 
</p>
<p>  Rule 101.2 (b) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members shall follow the directions and instructions properly issued by 
the Secretary-General and their supervisors. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff rule 101.2 (b) deals with the obligation of staff to follow directions 
properly given by supervising officials (see the 2001 standards of conduct, paras. 17 
and 18). The use of the word &ldquo;properly&rdquo; means that a supervisor who gives 
improper instructions will be held accountable since staff regulation 1.1 (c) 
introduces an affirmative duty on the Secretary-General to ensure that the rights 
and duties of staff are respected. 
</p>
<p>2. In the 2001 standards of conduct, the International Civil Service Commission 
noted that staff members have to follow the instructions they receive in connection 
with their official functions but also have a right to ask for written instructions if 
they have doubts as to the consistency of the instruction with the Charter or any 
other constitutional instrument, decisions of the governing bodies or administrative 
rules and regulations (ibid. para. 18). Although it is clear that staff must follow 
instructions, it should also be noted that staff have a right to appeal instructions 
that they consider infringe their rights pursuant to chapter XI of the Staff Rules. 
</p>
<p>3. Obviously, staff do not have to follow instructions that are manifestly 
inconsistent with their official functions or threaten their safety or have nothing to 
do with their official activities since such instructions are not proper. Such cases are 
rare and can usually be handled by seeking a review from the next level supervisor 
or by consulting the Office of Human Resources Management. 
 
</p>
<p>  Rule 101.2 (c) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members must comply with local laws and honour their private legal 
obligations, including, but not limited to, the obligation to honour orders of 
competent courts. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff rule 101.2 (c) is really an amplification of staff regulation 1.1 (f) 
(formerly staff regulation 1.8), which provides that the privileges and immunities of 
the Organization afford no excuse to staff for non-performance of their private 
obligations (see the 2001 standards of conduct, paras. 39 and 40). The Secretary-
General shall determine in any particular case whether such privileges and 
immunities exist and, if so, whether they shall be waived.

</p>
<p>ST/SGB/2002/13  
</p>
<p>2. Staff rule 101.2 (c) makes clear to staff that they have an obligation to honour 
such private obligations. This provision will assist the Organization effectively to 
ensure that staff respect court orders relating to their private obligations. In the 
event that a plaintiff forwards to the Organization a court order against a staff 
member, the Administration will seek the views of the staff member before taking any 
action on the basis of that order. It is the responsibility of staff who have an order 
against them that they contest to avail themselves of all existing means under the 
applicable national law to appeal the order and/or obtain relief from the obligation 
to comply with the order pending its appeal. 
</p>
<p>3. Failure to honour such private obligations may be treated as a disciplinary 
matter under article X of the Staff Regulations and chapter X of the Staff Rules. In 
cases of non-compliance with family support court orders, deductions from staff 
members&rsquo; salaries, wages and other emoluments may be made in accordance with 
the procedures set out in Secretary-General&rsquo;s bulletin ST/SGB/1999/4 as may be

prevent Member States, departments, offices, staff and other authorized persons

conduct which prevents others from performing official functions is not permitted. 
</p>
<p>3. It is noted that at times staff representatives have for certain periods 
suspended participation in joint bodies. Withdrawal by staff representatives from 
joint bodies does not constitute interference with official functions since the 
Administrative Tribunal has ruled that, in such cases, the Administration may 
proceed without the consultation normally needed pursuant to article VIII of the

</p>
<p> Staff rule 101.2 (f) prohibits the intentional misrepresentation of official title 
or duties to outside parties, for example, by placing misleading titles on business

<p> Staff rule 101.2 (g) puts staff on notice that the intentional unauthorized 
destruction, alteration or misplacement of records, which were intended to form 
part of the official files of the Organization, department or office, is prohibited. This 
has been a problem from time to time in disciplinary cases when key documents are 
found to be missing from official files of the Organization. The use of the word 
&ldquo;intentional&rdquo; makes clear that this is not a careless or accidental act.

relating to the financing of Secretariat programmes or units or in order to secure 
support for improving their personal situation or the personal situation of other staff 
members or for blocking or reversing unfavourable decisions regarding their status 
or their colleagues&rsquo; status.

<p> Staff members shall neither offer nor promise any favour, gift, remuneration or

third party in exchange for performing, failing to perform or delaying the 
performance of any official act. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p> The prohibition in staff rule 101.2 (i) applies to the staff member&rsquo;s relations 
with other staff members and to the staff member&rsquo;s relations with third parties. 
While the general proposition is that the practices described in the rule violate the 
highest standards of integrity required of staff members (see the 2001 standards of 
conduct, paras. 16, 46 and 47), the purpose of the new rule is specifically to deal 
with &ldquo;d&eacute;tournement de pouvoir&rdquo;, &ldquo;trafic d&rsquo;influence&rdquo; and other improper or even 
corrupt practices. 
 
</p>
<p>  Honours, gifts or remuneration 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Rule 101.2 (j) 
 
</p>
<p> Acceptance by staff members of any honour, decoration, favour, gift or 
remuneration from non-governmental sources requires the prior approval of the 
Secretary-General. Approval shall be granted only in exceptional cases and where 
such acceptance is not incompatible with the interests of the Organization and with 
the staff member&rsquo;s status as an international civil servant. However, staff members 
may occasionally accept, without prior approval, minor gifts of essentially nominal 
value having regard to the duty station concerned, provided that all such gifts are 
promptly disclosed to the head of the office, who may direct that the gift be 
entrusted to the Organization or returned to the donor. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff rule 101.2 (j) implements staff regulation 1.2 (l). It provides guidance on 
what honours, decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration may be accepted from 
non-governmental sources (see the 2001 standards of conduct, paras. 46 and 47). In 
essence, advance approval is required unless the gifts are of essentially nominal 
value, having regard to the duty station concerned. Acceptance of such items of 
essentially nominal value would not seem to present any significant risk of 
undermining the integrity or independence of staff members. The rule thus permits 
the staff member to accept gifts of essentially nominal value in view of the 
significant cost and effort that would be involved if staff members were required to 
seek prior approval. 
</p>
<p>2. The assessment of what is of &ldquo;essentially nominal value&rdquo; must be left to the 
best judgement of the staff member and the head of the office in the light of 
circumstances at the duty station concerned, since what is considered a minor gift at

<p>a Headquarters duty station may take on a different significance in a small field 
office. The problem is regulated through a requirement for staff either to obtain 
permission in advance or to disclose what they have received to the head of the 
office. It will be up to the head of the office to determine what is acceptable and, if 
he or she is in doubt, higher authorities may be consulted. As a safeguard against 
possible abuse, all gifts received in this manner are to be disclosed to the head of 
the office, who will have authority to direct that gifts already received be returned. 
 
</p>
<p>  Rule 101.2 (k) 
 
</p>
<p> The Secretary-General may authorize staff members to accept from a non-
governmental source or a university academic awards, distinctions and tokens of a 
commemorative or honorary character, such as scrolls, certificates, trophies or other 
items of essentially nominal monetary value. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p> Staff rule 101.2 (k) is based on former staff rule 101.9 (d) and permits the 
Secretary-General to authorize staff members to accept certain awards, distinctions 
and tokens from a non-governmental source or from a university. The rule provides 
that, for the purpose of the rule, universities are not considered government sources 
since, in many countries, they are not so considered and it would be incongruous for 
a staff member to be authorized to accept an honorary degree or certification from 
universities in some, but not all, countries. An honorary degree or certificate may 
therefore be accepted from universities in all countries.

<p>  Rule 101.2 (l) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members, as part of their official functions, will be expected from time to 
time to attend governmental or other functions such as meals and diplomatic 
receptions. Such attendance is not considered receipt of a favour, gift or 
remuneration within the meaning of the Staff Regulations and Rules.

<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p> Staff rule 101.2 (l) is new and deals with the issue of attendance at various 
official functions. It is clear that international officials are required, from time to 
time, to attend luncheons, dinners and diplomatic receptions. Such attendance will 
not be considered by the Secretary-General a favour or gift within the meaning of 
staff regulations 1.2 (j) to (l).

<p>  Rule 101.2 (m) 
 
</p>
<p> The Secretary-General may, in exceptional cases, provided that this is in the 
interest of the United Nations and not incompatible with the staff member&rsquo;s status, 
authorize a staff member to receive from a non-governmental source an honour, 
decoration, favour, gift or remuneration other than those referred to in staff rules

<p>remuneration from a non-governmental source that falls outside staff rules 101.2 (j) 
to (l) as long as such acceptance is in the interests of the United Nations and not 
inconsistent with the staff member&rsquo;s status. This provision flows from former staff 
rule 101.9 (c) since it is not possible to define in advance what may be accepted 
from a non-governmental source. 
 
</p>
<p>  Conflict of interest 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Rule 101.2 (n) 
 
</p>
<p> A staff member who has occasion to deal in his or her official capacity with 
any matter involving a profit-making business or other concern in which he or she 
holds a financial interest, directly or indirectly, shall disclose the measure of that 
interest to the Secretary-General and, except as otherwise authorized by the 
Secretary-General, either dispose of that financial interest or formally excuse 
himself or herself from participating with regard to any involvement in that matter 
which gives rise to the conflict of interest situation. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff rule 101.2 (n) is based on former staff rule 101.6 (c). However, the 
second part is new and deals with the consequences of a staff member disclosing to 
the Secretary-General that he or she has an interest, direct or indirect, in a profit-
making business or other concern (whether profit-making or not-for-profit) with 
which the United Nations is dealing. In such cases, unless the Secretary-General 
has authorized the staff member to deal with a particular matter despite the 
disclosed interest, the staff member will be directed to dispose of the interest or will 
be excused from dealing with the matter (see also the 2001 standards of conduct, 
paras. 21 and 22). 
</p>
<p>2. This provision departs from former staff rule 101.6 (d), which provided that 
the mere holding of shares in a company did not constitute a financial interest that 
would require disclosure. That provision has been deleted in the interest of 
transparency and the need to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest. Staff rule 
101.2 (n) requires that a staff member, with shares in a corporation with which he or 
she is to deal, would disclose that interest to his or her supervisor. Obviously 
whether there was a conflict would depend on the extent of the holding and on the 
nature of the staff member&rsquo;s duties. The object of the provision is to compel 
disclosure so that the Secretary-General can decide if there is a conflict situation 
before a problem arises. 
</p>
<p>3. If informal procedures are not sufficient to deal with questions that arise under 
this rule, under confidential clarification procedures established in administrative 
instruction ST/AI/2000/13 on outside activities, as may be amended or replaced by 
another issuance on the subject, staff can obtain advice on whether a planned 
outside occupation, employment or activity would conflict with their status. 
However, the common sense approach of excusing oneself from any dealings with an 
entity with which one has a financial interest would normally be appropriate.

<p> Staff rule 101.2 (s) is new and distinguishes the notion of gifts and so on from 
invitations routinely extended by Governments, intergovernmental organizations, 
non-governmental institutions or other private sources to the Secretary-General and 
staff members to attend conferences or meetings dealing with United Nations-
related matters hosted by them. This is currently routinely authorized by the 
Secretary-General and the rule reflects that current practice. It also provides an 
opportunity for the Organization to save on allowances that may be payable by the 
Organization by having the accommodation or travel and subsistence allowance 
provided by the Government, intergovernmental organization, non-governmental 
organizations or private source and by reducing the travel subsistence allowance 
that may otherwise be payable to the staff member.

Performance of staff

<p>  Regulation 1.3 (a) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members are accountable to the Secretary-General for the proper 
discharge of their functions. Staff members are required to uphold the highest 
standards of efficiency, competence and integrity in the discharge of their functions 
and their performance will be appraised periodically to ensure that the required 
standards of performance are met.

</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Much of staff regulation 1.3 deals with the standards of performance required 
of staff members and provides that they will be evaluated and held accountable to 
meet the required standards established by the Charter. Since the separately funded 
organs have systems of assessing performance that are adapted to meet their special 
needs, the provisions in staff regulation 1.3 (a) must remain very general. The 
regulation now explicitly places on managers the duty to make proper appraisals of 
performance, which reinforces the solid legislative basis for such procedures and 
practices. 
</p>
<p>2. Staff regulation 1.3 (a) makes it clear that staff members are required to 
uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity in the discharge 
of their functions (see Article 101 of the Charter and the 2001 standards of conduct, 
paras. 3-14 and 48-50). The regulation introduces the concept of accountability for 
performance as a fundamental condition of service. 
</p>
<p>3. The relationship of integrity to performance is discussed in the commentary to 
staff rule 101.3 (a). 
</p>
<p>4. An integral part of the performance of managers is to manage properly the 
human, financial and other resources entrusted to them. It should be emphasized 
that the higher level of responsibilities associated with managerial functions of 
managers entails a commensurate increase in their accountability for the proper 
performance of all their duties in managing the human and financial resources 
entrusted to them. 
 
</p>
<p>  Regulation 1.3 (b) 
 
</p>
<p> The whole time of staff members shall be at the disposal of the Secretary-
General for the performance of official functions; however, the Secretary-General 
shall establish a normal working week and shall establish official holidays for each 
duty station. Exceptions may be made by the Secretary-General as the needs of the 
service may require and staff members shall be required to work beyond the normal 
tour of duty when requested to do so. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p> Staff regulation 1.3 (b) combines the last two sentences of former staff 
regulation 1.2 into one sentence to make it clear that, although staff normally work 
an ordinary working week, they must work in excess of that working week when 
directed (see the 2001 standards of conduct, para. 41). It is, of course, clear that 
any requests to work additional hours must be reasonable and must be related to the 
needs of the service. Appropriate compensation arrangements are included in 
appendix B to the Staff Rules. The new regulation abolishes the requirement that 
those working hours must be reflected in an appendix to the Staff Rules as opposed 
to being issued in a local instruction.

Performance of staff members 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Rule 101.3 (a) 
 
</p>
<p> Staff members shall be evaluated for their efficiency, competence and integrity 
through performance appraisal mechanisms that shall assess the staff member&rsquo;s 
compliance with the standards set out in the Staff Regulations and Rules for 
purposes of accountability. 
 
</p>
<p>  Commentary 
 
</p>
<p>1. Staff rule 101.3 (a) makes explicit that the efficiency, competence and integrity 
required of staff by the Charter and staff regulation 1.3 (a) will be evaluated and 
that they will be held accountable to maintain the required standards. 
</p>
<p>2. Generally speaking an appraisal relates primarily to efficiency and 
competence, but integrity is part of the essential characteristic of an international 
civil servant and may have an impact on the performance of official duties. For 
example, abusive conduct by a staff member to his or her colleagues is not excused 
even though the staff member is efficient. On the other hand, the staff member&rsquo;s 
personal life is generally of no concern to a supervisor unless there is an impact on 
the discharge of his or her functions or on the role of that person as an international 
civil servant. As noted in the 2001 standards of conduct: 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;4. International civil servants should share the vision of their organizations. 
It is loyalty to this vision that ensures the integrity and international outlook of 
international civil servants; it guarantees that they will place the interests of 
their organization above their own and use its resources in a responsible 
manner. 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;5. The concept of integrity enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations 
embraces all aspects of behaviour of an international civil servant, including 
such qualities as honesty, truthfulness, impartiality and incorruptibility. These 
qualities are as basic as those of competence and efficiency, also enshrined in 
the Charter.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>3. It is important to note that competence and efficiency of staff include not only 
the way in which they perform their tasks but the way in which they interact with 
others. As noted in the 2001 standards of conduct, the obligations of staff to their 
supervisors, and of supervisors to their staff, is of crucial importance. Those duties 
and obligations bear repeating in this commentary: 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;15. Managers and supervisors are in positions of leadership and it is their 
responsibility to ensure a harmonious workplace based on mutual respect; they 
should be open to all views and opinions and make sure that the merits of staff 
are properly recognized. They need to provide support to them; this is 
particularly important when they are subject to criticism arising from the 
carrying out of their duties. Managers are also responsible for guiding and 
motivating their staff and promoting their development. 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;16. It is natural for managers to be seen as role models and they have 
therefore a special obligation to uphold the highest standards of conduct. It 
would be quite improper for them to solicit favours, gifts or loans from their

</p>
<p>staff; they must act impartially, without intimidation and favouritism. In 
matters relating to the appointment or career of others, no international civil 
servant should try to influence colleagues for personal reasons. 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;17. It is naturally incumbent on managers and supervisors to communicate 
effectively with their staff and share information with them. International civil 
servants have a reciprocal responsibility to provide all pertinent facts and 
information to their supervisors and to abide by and defend decisions taken, 
even when these do not accord with their personal views. 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;18. International civil servants have to follow the instructions they receive in 
connection with their official functions and if they have doubts as to whether 
an instruction is consistent with the Charter or any other constitutional 
instrument, decisions of the governing bodies or administrative rules and 
regulations, they should first consult their supervisors. If they cannot agree, 
the international civil servant may ask for written instructions. These may be 
challenged through the proper institutional mechanisms, but any challenge 
should not delay carrying out the instruction. International civil servants may 
also record their views in official files. They should not follow verbal or 
written instructions that are manifestly inconsistent with their official 
functions or that threaten their safety or that of others. 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;19. It must be the duty of international civil servants to report any breach of 
the organization&rsquo;s rules and regulations to a higher level official, whose 
responsibility it is to take appropriate action. An international civil servant 
who makes such a report in good faith has a right to be protected against 
reprisals or sanctions.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>4. It should be emphasized that supervisors will be assessed not only on their 
technical competence but also on the way in which they utilize the staff placed under 
their direction.

<p> V. Standards of conduct for the international civil service, 
2001k
 
 
</p>
<p>1. The United Nations and the specialized agencies embody the highest 
aspirations of the peoples of the world. Their aim is to save succeeding generations 
from the scourge of war and to enable every man, woman and child to live in dignity 
and freedom. 
</p>
<p>2. The international civil service bears responsibility for translating these ideals 
into reality. It relies on the great traditions of public administration that have grown 
up in member States: competence, integrity, impartiality, independence and 
discretion. But over and above this, international civil servants have a special 
calling: to serve the ideals of peace, of respect for fundamental rights, of economic 
and social progress, and of international cooperation. It is therefore incumbent on 
international civil servants to adhere to the highest standards of conduct; for, 
ultimately, it is the international civil service that will enable the United Nations 
system to bring about a just and peaceful world. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Guiding principles 
 
 
</p>
<p>3. The values that are enshrined in the United Nations organizations must also be 
those that guide international civil servants in all their actions: fundamental human 
rights, social justice, the dignity and worth of the human person and respect for the 
equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small.  
</p>
<p>4. International civil servants should share the vision of their organizations. It is 
loyalty to this vision that ensures the integrity and international outlook of 
international civil servants; it guarantees that they will place the interests of their 
organization above their own and use its resources in a responsible manner. 
</p>
<p>5. The concept of integrity enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations 
embraces all aspects of behaviour of an international civil servant, including such 
qualities as honesty, truthfulness, impartiality and incorruptibility. These qualities 
are as basic as those of competence and efficiency, also enshrined in the Charter. 
</p>
<p>6. Tolerance and understanding are basic human values. They are essential for 
international civil servants, who must respect all persons equally, without any 
distinction whatsoever. This respect fosters a climate and a working environment 
sensitive to the needs of all. To achieve this in a multicultural setting calls for a 
positive affirmation going well beyond passive acceptance. 
</p>
<p>7. International loyalty means loyalty to the whole United Nations system and 
not only to the organization for which one works; international civil servants have 
an obligation to understand and exemplify this wider loyalty. The need for a

</p>
<p>cooperative and understanding attitude towards international civil servants of other 
United Nations organizations is obviously most important where international civil 
servants of several organizations are serving in the same country or region.  
</p>
<p>8. If the impartiality of the international civil service is to be maintained, 
international civil servants must remain independent of any authority outside their 
organization; their conduct must reflect that independence. In keeping with their 
oath of office, they should not seek nor should they accept instructions from any 
Government, person or entity external to the organization. It cannot be too strongly 
stressed that international civil servants are not, in any sense, representatives of 
Governments or other entities, nor are they proponents of their policies. This applies 
equally to those on secondment from Governments and to those whose services have 
been made available from elsewhere. International civil servants should be 
constantly aware that through their allegiance to the Charter and the corresponding 
instruments of each organization, member States and their representatives are 
committed to respect this independent status. 
</p>
<p>9. Impartiality implies tolerance and restraint, particularly in dealing with 
political or religious convictions. While their personal views remain inviolate, 
international civil servants do not have the freedom of private persons to take sides 
or to express their convictions publicly on controversial matters, either individually 
or as members of a group. This can mean that, in certain situations, personal views 
should only be expressed with tact and discretion. 
</p>
<p>10. This does not mean that international civil servants have to give up their 
personal political views or national perspectives. It does mean, however, that they 
must at all times maintain a broad international outlook and an understanding of the 
international community as a whole. 
</p>
<p>11. The independence of the international civil service does not conflict with, or 
obscure, the fact that it is the member States that collectively make up (in some 
cases with other constituents) the organization. Conduct that furthers good relations 
with individual member States and that contributes to their trust and confidence in 
the secretariat strengthens the organization and promotes its interest. 
</p>
<p>12. International civil servants who are responsible for projects in particular 
countries or regions may be called upon to exercise special care in maintaining their 
independence. At times they might receive instructions from the host country but 
this should not compromise their independence. If at any time they consider that 
such instructions threaten their independence, they must consult their supervisors.  
</p>
<p>13. An international outlook stems from an understanding of and loyalty to the 
objectives and purposes of the international organization itself as set forth in its 
legal instruments. It implies, inter alia, respect for the right of others to hold 
different points of view and follow different cultural patterns. It requires a 
willingness to work without bias with persons of all nationalities, religions and 
cultures; it calls for constant sensitivity to how proposals, events and statements 
may look to others. It requires punctilious avoidance of any expressions that could 
be interpreted as biased or intolerant. Working methods can be different in different 
cultures. International civil servants should not be wedded to the attitudes, working 
methods or work habits of their own country or region.  
</p>
<p>14. Freedom from discrimination is a basic human right. International civil 
servants are expected to respect the dignity, worth and equality of all people without 
</p>
<p> 37 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> 
</p>
<p>ST/SGB/2002/13  
</p>
<p>any distinction whatsoever. Assumptions based on stereotypes must be assiduously 
avoided. One of the main tenets of the Charter is the equality of men and women, 
and organizations should therefore do their utmost to promote gender equality. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Working relations 
 
 
</p>
<p>15. Managers and supervisors are in positions of leadership and it is their 
responsibility to ensure a harmonious workplace based on mutual respect; they 
should be open to all views and opinions and make sure that the merits of staff are 
properly recognized. They need to provide support to them; this is particularly 
important when they are subject to criticism arising from the carrying out of their 
duties. Managers are also responsible for guiding and motivating their staff and 
promoting their development. 
 
</p>
<p>16. It is natural for managers to be seen as role models and they have therefore a 
special obligation to uphold the highest standards of conduct. It would be quite 
improper for them to solicit favours, gifts or loans from their staff; they must act 
impartially, without intimidation and favouritism. In matters relating to the 
appointment or career of others, no international civil servant should try to influence 
colleagues for personal reasons. 
</p>
<p>17. It is naturally incumbent on managers and supervisors to communicate 
effectively with their staff and share information with them. International civil 
servants have a reciprocal responsibility to provide all pertinent facts and 
information to their supervisors and to abide by and defend any decisions taken, 
even when these do not accord with their personal views. 
</p>
<p>18. International civil servants have to follow the instructions they receive in 
connection with their official functions and if they have doubts as to whether an 
instruction is consistent with the Charter or any other constitutional instrument, 
decisions of the governing bodies or administrative rules and regulations, they 
should first consult their supervisors. If they cannot agree, the international civil 
servant may ask for written instructions. These may be challenged through the 
proper institutional mechanisms, but any challenge should not delay carrying out the 
instruction. International civil servants may also record their views in official files. 
They should not follow verbal or written instructions that are manifestly 
inconsistent with their official functions or that threaten their safety or that of 
others. 
</p>
<p>19. It must be the duty of international civil servants to report any breach of the 
organization&rsquo;s rules and regulations to a higher level official, whose responsibility it 
is to take appropriate action. An international civil servant who makes such a report 
in good faith has the right to be protected against reprisals or sanctions. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Harassment 
 
 
</p>
<p>20. Harassment in any shape or form is an affront to human dignity and 
international civil servants must avoid it. They should not engage in any form of 
harassment and must be above any suspicion of it. International civil servants have 
the right to an environment free of harassment. It is the responsibility of 
</p>
<p>38  
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> 
</p>
<p> ST/SGB/2002/13
</p>
<p>organizations to explain their interpretation of the term and to establish rules and 
provide guidance on what constitutes harassment and how it will be dealt with. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Conflict of interest 
 
 
</p>
<p>21. It can happen that international civil servants are confronted with a question 
entailing a conflict of interest; such questions can be very sensitive and need to be 
treated with care. Conflict of interest includes circumstances in which international 
civil servants, directly or indirectly, would appear to benefit improperly, or allow a 
third party to benefit improperly, from their association in the management or the 
holding of a financial interest in an enterprise that engages in any business or 
transaction with the organization. 
</p>
<p>22. There can be no question but that international civil servants should avoid 
assisting private bodies or persons in their dealings with their organization where 
this might lead to actual or perceived preferential treatment. This is particularly 
important in procurement matters or when negotiating prospective employment. At 
times, international civil servants may be required to disclose certain personal assets 
if this is necessary to enable their organizations to make sure that there is no 
conflict. They should also voluntarily disclose in advance possible conflicts of 
interest that arise in the course of carrying out their duties. They should perform 
their official duties and conduct their private affairs in a manner that preserves and 
enhances public confidence in their own integrity and that of their organization. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Role of the secretariat 
 
 
</p>
<p>23. International organizations are constituted by member States, and their 
secretariats have the responsibility for providing services to them. The main 
function of the secretariat is to assist legislative bodies in their work and to carry 
out their decisions. The executive head is responsible for directing and controlling 
the work of the secretariat. Accordingly, when submitting proposals or advocating 
positions before a legislative body or committee, international civil servants are 
presenting the position of the executive head, not that of an individual or unit. 
</p>
<p>24. In providing services to a legislative or representative body, it goes without 
saying that international civil servants should serve only the interests of the 
organization. It would not be appropriate for international civil servants to prepare 
for government or other international civil service representatives any speeches, 
arguments or proposals on questions under discussion. It could, however, be quite 
appropriate to provide factual information, technical advice or assistance with such 
tasks as the preparation of draft resolutions. 
</p>
<p>25. It is entirely improper for international civil servants to lobby or seek support 
from government representatives or members of legislative organs to obtain 
advancement either for themselves or for others or to block or reverse unfavourable 
decisions regarding their status. By adhering to the Charter and the constitutions of 
the organizations of the United Nations system, Governments have undertaken to 
safeguard the independence of the international civil service; it is therefore 
understood that government representatives and members of legislative bodies will 
neither accede to such requests nor intervene in such matters. The proper method for 
</p>
<p> 39 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> 
</p>
<p>ST/SGB/2002/13  
</p>
<p>an international civil servant to address such matters is through administrative 
channels; each organization is responsible for providing these. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Staff management relations 
 
 
</p>
<p>26. Relations between management and staff should be guided by mutual respect. 
Elected staff representatives have a cardinal role to play in the consideration of 
conditions of employment and work, as well as in all matters of staff welfare. 
Freedom of association is a fundamental human right and international civil servants 
have the right to form and join associations, unions or other groupings to promote 
and defend their interests. Continuing dialogue between staff and management is 
indispensable. Management should facilitate this dialogue. 
</p>
<p>27. Elected staff representatives enjoy rights that derive from their status; this may 
include the opportunity to address legislative organs of their organization. These 
rights should be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the Charter, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international covenants on human 
rights and does not undermine the independence and integrity of the international 
civil service. In using the broad freedom of expression they enjoy, staff 
representatives must exercise a sense of responsibility and avoid undue criticism of 
the organization. 
</p>
<p>28. Staff representatives must be protected against discriminatory or prejudicial 
treatment based on their status or activities as staff representatives, both during their 
term of office and after it has ended. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Relations with member States and legislative bodies 
 
 
</p>
<p>29. It is the clear duty of all international civil servants to maintain the best 
possible relations with Governments and avoid any action which might impair this; 
they should certainly not interfere in the policies or affairs of Governments. It is 
unacceptable for them, either individually or collectively, to criticize or try to 
discredit a Government. At the same time, it is understood that international civil 
servants may speak freely in support of their organizations&rsquo; policies. Any activity, 
direct or indirect, to undermine or overthrow a Government constitutes serious 
misconduct. 
</p>
<p>30. International civil servants are not representatives of their countries, nor do 
they have authority to act as liaison agents between international organizations and 
their Governments. The executive head may, however, request an international civil 
servant to undertake such duties, a unique role for which international loyalty and 
integrity are essential. For their part, neither Governments nor organizations should 
place international civil servants in a position where their international and national 
loyalties may conflict.  
 
 
</p>
<p>  Relations with the public 
 
 
</p>
<p>31. For an international organization to function successfully, it must have the 
support of the public. All international civil servants therefore have a continuing 
responsibility to promote a better understanding of the objectives and work of their 
</p>
<p>40  
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> 
</p>
<p> ST/SGB/2002/13
</p>
<p>organizations. This requires them to be well informed of the achievements not only 
of their own organizations but of the United Nations system as a whole. The 
opportunity to provide information to the public can arise at any time. 
</p>
<p>32. There is a risk that on occasion international civil servants may be subject to 
criticism from outside their organizations; in keeping with their responsibility as 
international civil servants, they should respond with tact and restraint. They have 
the right to be defended by their organizations against criticism for actions taken in 
fulfilment of their duties and they should be confident that this will be done. 
</p>
<p>33. It would not be proper for international civil servants to air personal 
grievances or criticize their organizations in public. International civil servants 
should endeavour at all times to promote a positive image of the international civil 
service, in conformity with their oath of loyalty. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Relations with the media 
 
 
</p>
<p>34. Openness and transparency in relations with the media are effective means of 
communicating the organizations&rsquo; messages, and the organizations should have 
guidelines and procedures for this purpose. Within that context, the following 
principles should apply: international civil servants should regard themselves as 
speaking in the name of their organizations and avoid personal references and 
views; in no circumstances should they use the media to further their own interests, 
to air their own grievances, to reveal unauthorized information or to attempt to 
influence policy decisions facing their organizations. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Use and protection of information 
 
 
</p>
<p>35. The disclosure of confidential information may seriously jeopardize the 
efficiency and credibility of an organization. International civil servants are 
responsible for exercising discretion in all matters of official business. They must 
not divulge confidential information without authorization. Nor should international 
civil servants use information that has not been made public and is known to them 
by virtue of their official position to private advantage. These are obligations that do 
not cease upon separation from service. It is necessary for organizations to maintain 
guidelines for the use and protection of confidential information, and it is equally 
necessary for such guidelines to keep pace with developments in communications 
technology. It is understood that these provisions do not affect established practices 
governing the exchange of information between the secretariats and member States, 
which ensure the fullest participation of member States in the life and work of the 
organizations. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Respect for different customs and culture 
 
 
</p>
<p>36. The world is home to a myriad of different peoples, languages, cultures, 
customs and traditions. It is self-evident that a genuine respect for them all is 
fundamental for an international civil servant. Any behaviour that is not acceptable 
in a particular cultural context must be avoided. However, if a tradition is directly 
contrary to any human rights instrument adopted by the United Nations system, the 
</p>
<p> 41 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> 
</p>
<p>ST/SGB/2002/13  
</p>
<p>international civil servant must be guided by it. International civil servants should 
avoid an ostentatious lifestyle and any display of an inflated sense of personal 
importance. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Security and safety 
 
 
</p>
<p>37. While an executive head must remain free to assign staff in accordance with 
the exigencies of the service, it is the responsibility of organizations to make sure 
that the health, well-being and lives of their staff, without any discrimination 
whatsoever, will not be subject to undue risk. The organizations should take 
measures to protect their safety and that of their family members. On the other hand, 
it goes without saying that it is incumbent on international civil servants to comply 
with all instructions designed to protect their safety. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Personal conduct 
 
 
</p>
<p>38. The private life of international civil servants is their own concern and 
organizations should not intrude upon it. There can be situations, however, in which 
the behaviour of an international civil servant can reflect on the organization. 
International civil servants must therefore bear in mind that their conduct and 
activities outside the workplace, even if unrelated to official duties, can compromise 
the image and the interests of the organization. This can also result from the conduct 
of members of international civil servants&rsquo; households and it is the responsibility of 
international civil servants to make sure that their households are fully aware of this. 
</p>
<p>39. The privileges and immunities that international civil servants enjoy are 
conferred upon them solely in the interests of the organizations. They do not exempt 
international civil servants from observing local laws, nor do they provide an excuse 
for ignoring private legal or financial obligations. It should be remembered that only 
the executive head is competent to waive the immunity accorded to international 
civil servants or to determine its scope. 
</p>
<p>40. Violations of law can range from serious criminal activities to trivial offences, 
and organizations may be called upon to exercise judgement in the light of the 
nature and circumstances of individual cases. A conviction by a national court will 
usually, although not always, be persuasive evidence of the act for which an 
international civil servant was prosecuted, and acts that are generally recognized as 
offences by national criminal laws will normally also be violations of the standards 
of conduct for the international civil service.  
 
 
</p>
<p>  Outside employment and activities 
 
 
</p>
<p>41. The primary obligation of international civil servants is to devote their 
energies to the work of their organizations. It is therefore improper for international 
civil servants to engage, without prior authorization, in any outside activity, whether 
remunerated or not, that interferes with that obligation or is incompatible with their 
status or conflicts with the interests of the organization. Any questions about this 
should be referred to the executive head. 
</p>
<p>42  
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> 
</p>
<p> ST/SGB/2002/13
</p>
<p>42. Subject to the above, outside activities may, of course, be beneficial both to 
staff members and to their organizations. Organizations should allow, encourage and 
facilitate the participation of international civil servants in professional activities 
that foster contacts with private and public bodies and thus serve to maintain and 
enhance their professional and technical competencies. 
</p>
<p>43. International civil servants on leave, whether with or without pay, should bear 
in mind that they remain international civil servants in the employ of their 
organization and are still subject to its rules. They may, therefore, only accept 
employment, paid or unpaid, during their leave with proper authorization. 
</p>
<p>44. In view of the independence and impartiality that they must maintain, 
international civil servants, while retaining the right to vote, should not participate 
in political activities, such as standing for or holding local or national political 
office. This does not, however, preclude participation in local community or civic 
activities, provided that such participation is consistent with the oath of service in 
the United Nations system. It is necessary for international civil servants to exercise 
discretion in their support for a political party or campaign, and they should not 
accept or solicit funds, write articles or make public speeches or make statements to 
the press. These cases require the exercise of judgement and, where there is any 
doubt, should be referred to the executive head. 
</p>
<p>45. The significance of membership in a political party varies from country to 
country and it is difficult to formulate standards that will apply in all cases. In 
general, international civil servants may be members of a political party provided its 
prevailing views and the obligations imposed on its members are consistent with the 
oath of service in the United Nations system. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Gifts, honours and remuneration from outside sources 
 
 
</p>
<p>46. To protect the international civil service from any appearance of impropriety, 
international civil servants must not accept, without authorization from the 
executive head, any honour, decoration, gift, remuneration, favour or economic 
benefit of more than nominal value from any source external to their organizations; 
it is understood that this includes Governments as well as commercial firms and 
other entities. 
</p>
<p>47. It is not proper for international civil servants to accept supplementary 
payments or other subsidies from a Government or any other source prior to, during 
or after their assignment with an international organization if the payment is related 
to that assignment. Balancing this requirement, it is understood that Governments or 
other entities should not make or offer such payments, recognizing that they are at 
variance with the spirit of the Charter and the constitutions of the organizations of 
the United Nations system. 
 
 
</p>
<p>  Conclusion 
 
 
</p>
<p>48. The attainment of the standards of conduct for the international civil service 
requires the highest commitment of all parties. International civil servants must be 
committed to the values, principles and standards set forth here. They are expected 
to take a positive and active approach in upholding them. They should feel 
</p>

 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> 
</p>
<p>ST/SGB/2002/13  
</p>
<p>responsible for contributing to the broad ideals to which they dedicated themselves 
in joining the United Nations system. International organizations have a particular 
responsibility to ensure that the necessary guidance or rules are adopted to 
implement these standards. For their part, member States are expected, through their 
allegiance to the Charter and other constituent instruments, to preserve the 
independence and impartiality of the international civil service. 
</p>
<p>49. For these standards to be effectively applied, it is essential that they be widely 
disseminated, and that measures be taken to ensure that their scope and importance 
are understood throughout the international civil service, the member States and the 
organizations of the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>50. Respect for these standards assures that the international civil service will 
continue to be an effective instrument in fulfilling its responsibilities and in meeting 
the aspirations of the peoples of the world.

<p>Sustainable Procurement Risk Assessment1
</p>
<p> 
This guide has developed a sustainable procurement risk assessment methodology 
that can be easily utilised by all procurement staff, within their daily procurement 
roles.  
 
The social risk element is aimed specifically at identifying potential developing world 
supply chains. This has been focussed in this area as it is a key concern for 
organisational reputation. In addition, the subject of social issues in Procurement is 
complex and in potential conflict with European Public Procurement Directives. 
Therefore the issue of developing world supply chains has been identified as an area 
for initial focus as it is identifiable and an area where improvement can be made. 
 
It is intended that this new environmental and social methodology will be &ldquo;readily 
understood&rdquo; by all staff and will eventually: 
 
 Become part of the day to day procurement process 
</p>
<p> 
 Provide the individual organisation with a broad overview of the main 
</p>
<p>environmental impacts and risks associated with the purchase, use and disposal 
of a product (or service) it consumes. 
</p>
<p> 
 Flag areas of social risk in developing world supply chains, linked to life cycle 
</p>
<p>stages  
 
 Identify areas of high environmental risk and &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; that require active 
</p>
<p>management 
 
 Provide a platform for development  
</p>
<p> 
The methodology and subsequent individual risk assessments will act as the basis 
for staff to decide what actions are necessary and also possible that will reduce and 
manage the identified risks plus begin the process of incorporating environmental 
and social issues into the &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; paradigm. 
 
Risk Assessment Methodology 
 
To highlight the overall approach to risk assessment the following diagram has been 
developed. This diagram demonstrates the steps the Buyer needs to take in order to 
inform action within the contract to manage strategic, environmental and developing 
world social risk.

<p>Basic risk assessment methodology 
 
For organisations new to sustainable procurement principles it may be appropriate to 
begin with a basic risk assessment methodology prior to moving to the best practice 
template detailed later in this guide. The basic risk assessment is designed to be 
relatively simplistic and easy to complete and understand. Prior to developing an 
invitation to tender, and before awarding the final contract procurement teams should 
conduct three complimentary assessments on their contracts. These assessments 
should be used to inform contract strategy development. In terms of when to 
undertake this approach, it is recommended that a set of basic risk assessments are 
undertaken on all contracts. Some organisations may decide to set a deminimus for 
this reflecting resource constraints etc. For example the Environment Agency sets a 
threshold of &pound;10k. 
  
Basic strategic business risk assessment 
 
Procurement should evaluate the commercial nature of the intended purchase in 
relation to the internal structure and objectives of the organisation by providing 
answers to the following five key questions: 
 
 
(1) Is the purchase core to the business? 
</p>
<p>(e.g. Stationery is not core, but pipe/ cables are core to the business) 
 
 
</p>
<p>(2) Would recovery costs be high? 
(e.g. If a poor quality joint was used in underground cables that then needed 
replacing the cost of delivering this would be high, as cables would have to be 
dug up etc) 
</p>
<p> 
(3) Is there a limited number of suppliers? 
</p>
<p>(e.g. There is a limited number of companies that supply mobile 
telecommunication network services Orange, BT, Vodafone etc) 
</p>
<p> 
(4) Do we have difficulty in describing and measuring what we want? 
</p>
<p>(e.g. Research and Development Contracting, often the client is not an expert 
in this area and can find it difficult to define their requirements)  
</p>
<p> 
(5) Will the organisation suffer negative PR if supply fails? 
</p>
<p>(e.g. If an electricity company cannot get cables to replace damaged cables 
following a storm, leaving the public without electricity supply then negative 
PR will be seen) 
</p>
<p> 
These high level risk questions will begin to flag the commercial issues in the 
purchase being developed.

<p>Basic Environmental and Social risk assessment 
 
Procurement should then evaluate the significant environmental risks/impacts of the 
intended purchase by providing answers to the following six key questions. 
Procurement should then determine the likelihood of a developing world supply chain 
(developing world in this context is broadly defined as supply chains that enter South 
America, Asia, Africa and Australasia): 
 
(1) Does the purchase or the service provider have potential for high-energy 
</p>
<p>consumption? 
(e.g. A pump uses a significant amount of energy in its life) 
</p>
<p> 
(2) Is the product made of, or does the service provider use unsustainable 
</p>
<p>materials? 
(e.g. Consider whether the materials regenerate themselves such as softwood 
timber whereas aggregates do not regenerate themselves etc) 
</p>
<p> 
(3) Does the item or the service provider have potential to cause a pollution 
</p>
<p>incident in the performance of our work? 
(e.g. Plant working in or near a water course has the potential to cause 
pollution due to the amount of fuel/ hydraulic fluids contained in the machine) 
</p>
<p> 
(4) Are excessive emissions (land, air, and water) caused during the manufacture 
</p>
<p>of goods used directly or by service providers? 
(e.g. Consider how processed and manufactured the goods/ service are, 
plastics are highly processed from oils with subsequent high energy inputs 
and emissions) 
</p>
<p> 
(5) Is there a likelihood of a developing world supply chain? 
</p>
<p>(e.g. Consider if the materials that comprise the good or service typically 
originate from the developing world, also is manufacturing likely to be in the 
developing world. For example, electronic components are often made in the 
developing world. The majority of items that comprise rubber will typically 
have originated in the developing world etc)  
</p>
<p> 
(6) Is there an environmental/ social PR risk to the organisation in purchasing the 
</p>
<p>product or service? 
(e.g. Any purchase of tropical hardwoods/ potential use of child labour can 
result in negative press)   
</p>
<p> 
This again will start to flag the degree of environmental and social risk present in the 
contract. 
 
Basic Assessment of Market influence 
 
Before risks can be assessed and a strategy determined Procurement must first 
identify the degree of influence it has with the supply base. The prime reason for this 
is to ensure that significant resources are not expended on detailed risk analysis 
where little scope exists to manage or influence the current marketplace. 
 
</p>
<p>Page 4 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>To begin this assessment the procuring organisation should attempt to take a cold 
hard look at itself from the markets perspective. The objective of this inward 
examination is to determine how important your business is to the supplier and how 
easy your organisation is to do business with.  
 
The degree of influence relates directly to your importance as a client and the nature 
of your business relationship. Generally, Buyers will only be able to make demands 
or transfer risk where they are a key client and/ or where a positive business 
relationship exists. There is not a prescribed model for this assessment, but detailed 
below are some points that a supplier would consider when looking at your business: 
 
 Does this organisation brand/ reputation influence us? 
 Is this organisation a customer that is easy to work with? 
 Is this organisation an intelligent client that is informed in its dealings? 
 Is this organisation efficient in its business dealings with us (does it meet time 
</p>
<p>commitments)? 
 Does this organisation pay on time? 
 Is this organisation a key client we need to have in order for us to win other 
</p>
<p>business with other organisations? (e.g. a pipe supplier must have water 
companies in its customer portfolio in order to have credibility with other clients) 
</p>
<p> Does this organisations total yearly business represent more than 0.5% of our 
turnover? 
</p>
<p> Of the products/ services that this customer buys, is it the main customer of those 
products within our portfolio? 
</p>
<p> Is this organisation open to change to make itself easier to work with? 
 By working with this organisation do we become better? 
 Do we operate in a saturated market? (numerous suppliers or product choice?) 
 Are low switching costs operative within this marketplace? (is it easy and cheap 
</p>
<p>for buyers to switch from one supplier to another with minimal disruption?) 
 
Influence rating mechanism 
 
Based on research and considering the questions detailed above, Buyers should 
rate the degree of influence present in this market. 
 
 
1____________________________5______________________________10 
 
Low     Moderate                High 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>This assessment highlights to the Buyer the potential influence to facilitate change 
within the marketplace. This will have a direct link to how demanding the Buyer can 
be with the supplier in trying to manage risks. Where influence is high the Buyer can 
be demanding, if its moderate Buyers should target key areas and if it is low Buyers 
should either actively source alternative supplies or focus on supplier awareness.

<p>Bring the Strategic, Environment and Influence assessment together 
 
Having considered the strategic and environmental risks, with the degree of 
influence in the market. The buyer now has the background information from which 
to identify mitigation measures within the contract strategy to manage the risks. The 
diagram below demonstrates how the assessments are individually completed and 
then brought together.

into.

<p>Best Practice Risk Assessment Process 
 
This approach builds upon best practice risk management and is based upon a life 
cycle approach for both environmental and social assessment.  This form of 
assessment is naturally more complex than the basic assessment highlighted 
previously and should only be implemented by organisations who have a relatively 
sophisticated approach to environmental procurement. Alternatively new 
organisations should use this more detailed risk assessment on a targeted basis, 
focussing on high risk commodities first before using the process more widely for all 
procurement activity.   
 
Best Practice Strategic Risk Assessment 
 
Strategic risk to a business can result from a variety of areas.  Examples of issues 
that can lead to this sort of risk are detailed below. Consider whether any of these 
risks apply to the product/service being procured. Any other risks specific to this 
requirement should also be identified. 
 
 Purchase specifically relates to your organisation&rsquo;s core business 
 There is a limited number of suppliers 
 Your organisation has difficulty in specifying what it wants 
 There are major PR risks in failing to adequately source this product/service 
 The Purchase represents significant environmental concern 
 There is a likelihood of developing world supply chains and ethical issues  
 There appears to be substantial Health and Safety concerns in this purchase 
 The product/service is subject to swift technological change 
 There are significant licensing or intellectual property issues with this 
</p>
<p>product/service 
 The market appears to be unstable 
 The product/service requires a long term commitment from supplier 
 The specification is limited by legal/statutory implications 
 The purchase needs to integrate with existing product service 
</p>
<p> 
From this assessment Buyers should rate the degree of risk that your organisation 
faces in procuring this product/service. 
 
Low_________________________Medium____________________________High 
 
If the annual spend of the contract is in excess of &pound;1,000,000 per annum this would 
be classified as high value. Therefore contracts that are: 
 
HIGH VALUE AND HIGH RISK &ndash; Are STRATEGIC contracts, where Procurement 
needs to focus its effort to manage the real risks to the business 
LOW VALUE AND HIGH RISK &ndash; Are SECURITY contracts, that whilst of low value 
are vital to the business and have a high potential for risk 
HIGH VALUE AND LOW RISK &ndash; Are PROFIT contracts, where the focus is 
obtaining best value, risk is minimal so the focus will be on cost and quality 
LOW VALUE AND LOW RISK &ndash; Are ACQUISITION contracts, where little focus is 
placed the emphasis here is on minimising the transactional cost of procurement 
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Mapping Products and Services to determine priority 
 
Using this methodology products and services can be mapped onto a Boston Matrix 
to identify the areas Procurement should focus on to drive real value and strategic 
contribution to the business. See example below, based on typical Environment 
Agency bought products and services: 
 
 
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This exercise if completed at an organisation level for all commodities flags to 
Buyers and the wider organisation the activity to focus on and the areas to most 
closely manage.  
 
Prioritising Strategic Risks using Vulnerability Assessment 
 
To further augment and complete the strategic risk assessment an examination of 
areas where your organisation is vulnerable needs to be performed, particularly for 
high risk purchases. The vulnerability analysis needs to look at areas that are both 
internal and external to the organisation, e.g. internally you may be vulnerable due to 
fluctuating budgets, externally you may be vulnerable due to the risks identified in 
the best practice strategic assessment.  The vulnerability areas are scored with high 
scoring 3, medium 2 and low 1. The areas are ranked to determine their priority in 
strategy formulation. Example: 
  
Vulnerability   Likelihood  Impact Duration Score 
 
1. Fluctuating Budgets H / M / L H / M / L H / M / L 7 
 
2. Resource Availability H / M / L H / M / L H / M / L 8 
 
3. Immature Market  H / M / L H / M / L H / M / L 7 
 
This approach prioritises risks and focuses attention on the risks that need to be 
most closely managed to really address the strategic risks inherent in the contract.

Life Cycle Approach 
 
Many best practice approaches to environmental risk assessment include evaluation 
of the environmental impacts throughout the whole life of a product or service to 
ascertain where the environmental impacts occur in the life cycle of the commodity.

<p> 
However, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as an environmental management tool 
consists of a detailed scientific assessment, which requires a substantial amount of 
time and very specific environmental expertise to complete. It is clear that many 
Buyers have neither the time to conduct such assessments on every product/ service, 
nor would it be cost effective or practical for all staff to complete the training required 
(minimum of at least a one-year course). Therefore conducting a full LCA on each 
product/ service would not be appropriate. 
</p>
<p>+ Energy + Energy 
</p>
<p> 
However, the logical approach is the introduction of a tool that promotes and 
encourages life cycle thinking. Thereby, encouraging Procurement to examine and 
think about the various lifetime environmental impacts of commodities. This 
approach will enable the organisation to identify the most significant environmental 
risks and impacts. 
 
Main issues to consider include: 
 
 Sustainability of raw materials 
 Energy consumed in the manufacturing/ conversion process 
 Hazardous substances used within the life cycle 
 Environmental impact in &ldquo;use&rdquo; 
 Biodegradability at the end of its useful life 
 Likelihood of a developing world supply chain 
</p>
<p> 
The Environment Agency undertook research into learning methods for procurement 
staff on this approach, and, in the main this structure was well received. The 
research also showed that staff could readily identify with the particular stage in life 
cycle (i.e. raw materials, manufacture, use or disposal) that the environmental impact 
occurs. Also Procurement staff can link this to action within the contract. For 
example:

occasions where a procurement action may be appropriate in more than one stage 
of the life cycle.

Explanatory Notes: 
 
Energy has been blocked out in the raw material stage, as there are arguments to 
say that energy will always be a raw material and therefore a score here would 
provide a misleading overall score. Therefore if a process is energy intensive the box 
would be ticked in the manufacture column. 
 
Disposal the four main environmental issues associated with landfill and incineration 
are available for staff to tick. 
 
Developing world supply chains has been included in the tool because this is 
recognised as a key area to begin the process of integrating social issues into 
Procurement. Thereby broadening the approach into the sustainability arena.  
 
Procurement people using the form would develop their initial ideas recorded in the 
Life Cycle Record to indicate with a &ldquo;tick&rdquo; if they thought the aspect was significant in 
a particular phase of the life cycle. Procurement can then come to their conclusions 
by also doing one or more of the following:  
 
 brainstorming amongst themselves (including any internal environmental experts); 
 conducting their own further research;   
 consulting with supplementary additional product/ service briefing documents if 
</p>
<p>available (see separate product/ service guidance) 
 
The advantage of this approach is that it is designed to allow Buyers to 
systematically identify the significant environmental impacts, plus identify where in 
the commodities&rsquo; life cycle they actually occur. It is also a simple and quick 
assessment that can be used by anyone who has been trained in life cycle thinking 
and has a little knowledge about the commodity being evaluated.  
 
In addition, as highlighted previously, the particular stage of the life cycle that the 
impact occurs can often determine the potential environmental procurement action 
required. Therefore this tool will be instrumental in helping staff develop their 
environmental procurement strategies for each commodity. 
 
The sections on developing world supply chain have been excluded from the total 
scoring method as they need to be treated separately. Basically any tick at any stage 
of the life cycle that shows a potential of a developing world supply chain is evidence 
of corporate social and reputational risk. If developing world impacts are identified at 
numerous stages of the life cycle then the organisation has a high social risk in its 
supply chain that needs to be managed. The separate product/ service guidance 
gives examples of commodities that have particular high social impacts. (See fact 
sheets for electronic equipment, IT equipment, machinery etc)   
 
Please note: The fact that the aspects are directly linked to any environmental 
management system means that the results of these assessments and any 
subsequent actions can also become part of any organisation wide environmental 
reporting mechanisms.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Step 3: Strategic Environmental and Social Risk 
 
The Life Cycle Impact Mapping will be useful in assisting Buyers to identify 
environmental impacts of the product or service being purchased. However, life cycle 
impact mapping will not necessarily identify any strategic environmental risks to the 
purchasing organisation. In terms of environmental issues, the main strategic risks 
can be summarised into the following list. 
 
 Avoiding or minimising the purchasing a commodity that deliberately contradicts a 
</p>
<p>national environmental strategy for example, national waste strategies or climate 
change mitigation strategies. 
</p>
<p> 
 Identifying the commodities being purchased that are affected by existing or 
</p>
<p>forthcoming legislation such as electronic products and the WEEE (Waste 
Electrical and Electronic Equipment) directive or the phase out of Halon 
commonly used in fire extinguishers. 
</p>
<p> 
 Identifying those commodities being purchased from industries that are actively 
</p>
<p>being regulated as a priority by the Environment Agency. In other words subject 
to IPPC (Integrated Pollution and Prevention Control) regulations. (These 
industries are seen as high risk in terms of pollution incidents hence the specific 
guidance and regulations). 
</p>
<p> 
 Identifying those commodities that consist of hazardous substances and use 
</p>
<p>significant amounts of non-renewable natural resources or energy. 
 
 Identifying those commodities or suppliers that are the focus of pressure group 
</p>
<p>campaign activity. This may lead to negative PR and reputational damage. 
 
With these specific risks in mind the following question set has been developed that 
could be used in this strategic environmental and social risk assessment. 
 
The questions are focused on the strategic environmental procurement risks facing 
organisations, rather than actual impacts identified in the &ldquo;life cycle thinking&rdquo;.  The 
two assessment methods should be used on each commodity to provide the overall 
environmental risk assessment.

the life cycle mapping model and/ or any yes statements to the above four questions 
then the Buyer needs to be careful.

<p>Best Practice assessment of Market Influence 
 
This approach is designed to provide an overview of the process that should be 
considered when researching a particular supply market and determining the degree 
of influence present. When letting a contract for a high risk requirement this 
approach is used to inform and develop a Procurement strategy. Therefore, 
Procurement should consider the following questions: 
 
1. What product/ service is required, when is it required and in what likely volume 
  
2. What information can be obtained from the Client and other Procurement 
</p>
<p>Colleagues? Internal records, visit reports and questionnaires may be available to 
support this. 
</p>
<p> 
3. What is the size of the market for this product/service? You should start with a 
</p>
<p>national model and then extend this if applicable to consider the global supply 
position. Market information may be available from, national trade associations, 
chartered institutes, Chambers of Commerce, CBI, DTI, National Statistics Office, 
Embassies, and Trade attaches. The Export Market information Centre based in 
London, also has a library containing all major international statistical sources. In 
addition private companies such as Economist Intelligence Unit and Keynote 
compile reports which can be purchased.  Additionally, the Internet is also a 
valuable source of information.  As with all data you need to verify the source and 
quality of the information. 
</p>
<p> 
4. How is the market structured, 
 
</p>
<p> Geographically? (i.e. are the suppliers predominantly local/ regional/ national/ 
global companies ?). 
</p>
<p> 
 By customer type (i.e. do the suppliers target mainly public/private sector, or 
</p>
<p>wholesale distributor/direct to end users) 
 
</p>
<p> Is the market currently a buyers or sellers market? This considers the 
particular general economic conditions at the time relating to the supply and 
demand for goods and services you intend to purchase. (i.e. the demand for 
software experts reached a premium in the run up to the millennium. Post 
millennium rates reduced dramatically. 
</p>
<p> 
5. Who are the major suppliers to this market?  and how is the market serviced. i.e. 
</p>
<p>Manufacturers, distributors, third party providers etc (This information is again 
likely to be available through the sources mentioned in section 3).

</p>
<p> Are there any restructuring trends evident in the market? 
 Have there been, or are there likely to be any significant take-

<p>overs/mergers in the foreseeable future, and is this likely to influence price 
and availability?  
</p>
<p> 
This material is likely to be contained within trade and national press. Much of 
this information is speculative and therefore must be treated with caution. 
</p>
<p> 
 
It may be useful to conduct a SWOT analysis, Strengths, Weaknesses, 
Opportunities and Threat. This approach attempts to assess internal strengths 
and weaknesses of the buying organisation in relation to the external 
opportunities and threats relating to a particular supply market.

<p>Focussing a Contract Development Programme on Sustainability Issues 
 
Most Utility Sector organisations have a Contract Development Programme based 
on historic expenditure analysis and projected spend. It enables Procurement to 
effectively plan and prioritise the renewal of existing contractual agreements as well 
as planning new work areas. In order to efficiently manage the environmental risks 
inherent in a procurement teams portfolio, Procurement needs to identify and 
integrate contracts into this programme that address and mitigate the organisations 
main environmental and developing world social impacts. Thereby giving priority to 
managing contracts that present the greatest environmental and social risk. 
Unfortunately the tradition can be to focus on areas that are easy to address such as 
paper and stationery, but obviously these are not the contracts with the greatest 
environmental or social impact.  
 
Therefore organisations should place effort to manage the contracts with the 
greatest environmental and social risk. As a start, focus should be placed on 
environmentally improving contract arrangements in the ten key areas of expenditure 
that represent the most significant environmental impacts. Mapping of the supply 
chain should also be undertaken to ascertain any developing world inputs to either 
the raw materials or manufacturing of the end components. 
 
Risk categorisation is based on an assessment of the products or services using the 
best practice environmental and social risk assessment approach detailed earlier.  
 
</p>
<p>Page 23 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Developing World Social Risk 
 
It should be recognised that many of the products and services that organisations 
procure have likely developing world supply chain.  This is typically present in the 
raw materials phase where the raw material inputs such as rubber, plastics etc are 
sourced from the developing world. Information Technology and Electronics have 
rated highly because a number of raw materials originate in the developing world, 
often manufacturing of electronics is in the developing world and additionally 
disposal can often take place in the developing world. This is due to the fact that 
many organisations either sell or give away old information technology equipment 
which can often be either given to or bought by developing world countries. However, 
it must also be recognised that this in itself has a social benefit and should continue. 
 
However, disposal will then take place in the developing world countries and are 
therefore outside of the proposed WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 
Directives). Organisations therefore need to be cognisant of their developing world 
impacts in all the products and services detailed and take action to manage any 
inherent risk. 
 
Managing Developing World Social Risk in the Supply Chain 
 
Having identified the likelihood of a developing world supply chain the next question 
is what to do about it? Firstly, do not cancel contracts and source within the 
developed world. This approach just exacerbates the problems of the developing 
world and leads to even greater social problems within the supply chain. The key 
stage of this is deciding as an organisation what are the minimum social standards 
for doing business with you. For example, you may wish to base this around the 
SA80007 standards which details the following principles:  
 
 No children under the age of 14 (ILO Convention 38) 
 No forced labour 
 Safe and healthy working environment 
 Right to form trade unions 
 No discrimination 
 Normal working week shall not exceed 48 hours 
 All overtime to be reimbursed 
 Pay to meet legal or industry minimum and sufficient to meet basic needs and 
</p>
<p>give discretionary income 
 Management System and review to manage these social issues 
</p>
<p> 
Before embarking on this approach your organisation needs to define what it 
believes is socially/ ethically acceptable in its supply chains based on its values, 
stakeholders etc. See Sustainable Procurement Strategy Model. 
 
Having determined a minimum standard the next issue for the organisation is, what 
do we do with companies that do not meet this standard? The worst option is to 
cancel the contract as this will potentially lead to even greater social hardship. 
 
                                                 
7 Social Accountability International See Web site: http://www.cepaa.org/SA8000%20Standard.htm  
</p>
<p>Page 24 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Therefore the preferred approach is to work with suppliers to raise the standard. 
However, achieving this will involve funding and again your organisation will need to 
decide if it is willing to invest to improve its social record within the supply chain. A 
potential way of dealing with this is to use Procurement cost savings from other 
contracts to fund social improvement within the supply chain. Areas of such 
improvement may be buying protective equipment, raising wages or sponsoring 
education of workers. Again this needs to be the subject of a policy decision at an 
organisational level reflecting values, culture and financing, but it is only by 
addressing these issues that organisations can truly say they are becoming more 
sustainable.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Selection of Sustainable Suppliers 
 
Understanding the market and a suppliers skills is a core role of Procurement. The 
methods for gathering information to begin the process of understanding the market 
has been outlined previously in section X. To augment market assessment 
Procurement may undertake a supplier pre-qualification assessment exercise. This 
exercise will focus on a range of issues from general business management, quality 
management, references etc and should also include both environmental and social 
issues. Linking back to the best practice risk assessment approach (section X), if the 
majority of impacts are in the raw materials phase the focus should be on the 
supplier own environmental supply chain management policies. If the impacts are in 
the manufacturing stage then the focus is on the suppliers own environmental 
management system for their business.  
 
A supplier&rsquo;s own environmental performance should be one of the key criteria utilised 
in supplier selection. Equally where relevant the supplier approach to managing its 
developing world social impacts should also form part of the assessment.  
 
When reviewing the response to any questionnaire, of particular importance is that 
the supplier&rsquo;s environmental and social policies actually address the key impacts of 
their business. For example an environmental policy from a chemical manufacturer 
needs to deal with the environmental issues of making chemicals rather than looking 
at its paper consumption and car policy, which whilst valid are not the main impacts 
of this business.

<p>Assessing the completed Questionnaire 
 
To assess the responses to the questionnaire an assessment methodology and 
scoring matrix has been developed.  
 
Using the matrix 
</p>
<p> 
The elements of the matrix have been chosen to represent the key measures of the 
environmental and ethical maturity or capability of the supplier.  Each statement in the 
matrix reflects a different level of environmental and ethical capability. The supplier 
can be sent a pack containing a copy of the matrix with which to assess their own 
capability (providing the necessary justification for the score assigned on a separate 
sheet).  
 
The Buyer, together with the contract client and any environmental specialist as 
appropriate, will then assess the evidence provided, together with the statements 
made in support of the self-assessment.  The result of the assessment should be a 
score for each element, which can then be transferred to a simple profile chart. 
 
Categorising of suppliers 
 
The Buyer can use the profile to determine where each supplier fits within our 
marketing strategy to target effort on environmental and social improvements to the 
supply chain.  
 
Sustainably Unaware 
 
A supplier who is assessed predominately at Level 1 will generally be seen as being 
UNAWARE within the definition in the marketing plan. 
 
This will usually mean that the company has made no real effort to consider the 
environmental impact of supplying the products or services.  It is likely to be primarily 
price-focused or cost-focused in those areas that offer a direct return to the business 
(for example, energy consumption). 
 
Any environmental or ethical benefits will only arise as a by-product of the cost or 
production changes implemented by the business to maintain its market 
competitiveness.  
 
Sustainability Settler  
 
A supplier who is assessed predominately at Level 2 or 3 will be seen as a SETTLER 
within the definition in the marketing plan. 
The supplier will generally be aware of environmental and ethical issues associated 
with any product or service provided and will be looking to incorporate their impact 
into the production and purchasing activity.  
 
</p>
<p>Page 29 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The extent to which they are included will depend directly upon the individual&rsquo;s 
commitment to or influence over the business policy.  The basis of any consideration 
will be either risk avoidance, in the case of pollution and potential prosecutions, or 
cost reduction, in the case of energy consumption and waste minimisation.  
 
A reactive rather than pro-active approach is likely and there will be wide variations 
across the total business operation. The level of personal commitment to 
environmental and ethical issues is the key driver in determining the extent to which 
the business incorporates environmental issues into its everyday operations. 
Personnel in the business will probably give personal views on what is being done 
rather than referring to an organisational strategy. Initiatives will be specific to 
functions and their benefits will be uncoordinated. 
 
Sustainable Pioneer 
 
A supplier who is assessed predominately at Level 4 or 5 will clearly be seen as a 
PIONEER within the definition in the marketing plan. 
 
The supplier will be fully familiar with the concept of environmental impact analysis 
and will always include appropriate environmental considerations in their own 
purchasing decisions. They will have a formal method of evaluating performance, 
possibly using a formal Environmental Management System (EMS), and the company 
will be either EN14000 registered or be working towards EN 14000 registration.  
Furthermore, when considering products sourced overseas, the supplier will consider 
the ethical impacts that this purchasing will have, for example, the exploitation of 
underage labour, the working conditions, use of natural resource and the like.   
 
Each department will have its own internally developed targets aligned to an overall 
organisational target with clearly defined associations to the business objectives. 
 
There will be a formal audit of performance, either internally or externally based, and 
a good system of communication of achievements and reporting methodology.  
 
Scoring Matrix &ndash; Steps to Best Practice 
 
The scoring matrix is designed to be used for two purposes: 
 
1. To provide a structured and consistent approach to the assessment of suppliers 
</p>
<p>environmental and ethical management of their business  
2. To demonstrate to suppliers the steps needed to reach environmental best 
</p>
<p>practice 
 
Suppliers can use the matrix to score themselves and see the degree of the gap 
against best practice. The matrix then gives suppliers the steps they need to take in 
order to become a pioneer in this field.

<p>Glossary of Procurement Terms 
 
Term Description or explanation 
arbitration A method that is agreed to in advance by the parties to a 
</p>
<p>contract to resolve a dispute by submission to one or more 
neutral third party arbitrators for a binding judgement; 
arbitration is normally used to avoid litigation, i.e. court 
procedures. 
</p>
<p>award The action taken by the buyer based on the evaluation of 
offers, to approve the selection of the supplier for a specific 
contract. 
</p>
<p>best and final offer A tool that can be used during the final evaluation phase of a 
procurement using an RFP when at least two qualified 
suppliers remain within a competitive range. It is a term that 
indicates to the supplier that the buyer does not intend to 
negotiate after offers are received so the supplier should 
submit final pricing and deliverables.  
</p>
<p>bid An offer in response to an Invitation to Bid or an offer in 
reponse to an electronic auction 
</p>
<p>bid security (bid bond) A security from a supplier securing obligations resulting from 
a contract award with the intention to avoid: the withdrawal or 
modification of an offer after the deadline for submission of 
such documents; failure to sign the contract or failure to 
provide the required security for the performance of the 
contract after an offer has been accepted; or failure to comply 
with any other condition precedent to signing the contract 
specified in the solicitation documents. 
</p>
<p>bidder, proposer, offeror An entity that submits an offer in response to a solicitation. 
Normally, the term bidder is used to refer to the entity 
responding to an ITB, RFQ or an electronic auction; the term 
proposer is used to refer to the entity responding to an RFP. 
</p>
<p>bill of lading A carrier's contract and receipt for goods it agrees to transport 
from one place to another and to deliver to a designated 
recipient (consignee).  
</p>
<p>bill of quantities PPH: A description and a quantitative estimate of all 
materials, and/or supplies, which will be required for a 
proposed construction project or production of equipment 
(usually custom designed), provided to bidders for pricing 
purposes. 
</p>
<p>blanket purchase order A special purchase order typically designed to leverage 
repetitive requirements and emergency repairs involving low 
value goods and services, while reducing the administrative 
workload. </p>

</p>
<p>Term Description or explanation 
buyer The individual or personnel designated by an authorized 
</p>
<p>official to undertake all activities necessary for the 
procurement of goods, works, or services in accordance with 
the applicable regulations, rules, policies, and procedures. The 
term buyer is also used to denote the UN entity that is a party 
to the contract. 
</p>
<p>catalogue An organised list of goods or services specifying the 
description, price, unit of measure and other attributes. A 
catalogue may be available as a document or in electronic 
format. 
</p>
<p>collaborative procurement, 
common procurement 
</p>
<p>A procurement arrangement in which several UN 
organizations combine their efforts to undertake procurement 
in cooperation or share the outcome of a procurement process, 
thereby achieving benefits for the group in its entirety. The 
objective of collaborative procurement is to achieve reduced 
price or better service through economies of scale and to 
reduce inefficiency and duplication across the UN 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>competitive bidding A procurement method in which offers from competing 
suppliers are invited by open advertisement and provided with 
the scope, specifications, and terms and conditions of the 
proposed contract as well as the criteria by which the offers 
will be evaluated. The objectives of competitive bidding are 
to obtain goods or services at the lowest cost or best value 
through open and fair competition. 
</p>
<p>consignment (1) An agreement with a supplier to stock goods at a 
customer's location with the goods remaining the property of 
the supplier until used or sold; (2) A shipment that is handed 
over to a common carrier for transport and delivery. 
</p>
<p>contract In the context of UN procurement, a contract is a written, 
legally binding agreement between the organization and a 
supplier, which establishes the terms and conditions, 
including the rights and obligations of the organization and 
the supplier. A contract may take many different forms, e.g. 
agreement, purchase order, memorandum of understanding, 
letters of assist. 
</p>
<p>contract administration All actions undertaken after the award of a contract relating to 
the administrative aspects of the contract, such as contract 
amendment, contract closure, record retention, maintenance 
of the contract file, and handling of security instruments (e.g., 
performance security). </p>

<p>fixed price A contract term which indicates that the price is set at a 
certain amount and is not subject to change unless the 
purchaser requests a change in specifications, delivery or 
term. Generally, a purchaser's request for a change to 
specifications, delivery or terms in a fixed price contract 
would only occur in response to an unexpected change in 
specifications or a critical circumstance that would impact the 
supplier's ability to fulfill the contract in accordance with the 
original terms.  </p>
