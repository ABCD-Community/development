<p>Preface to the Second Edition
</p>
<p>Observation of a gravitational wave is the most spectacular recent application of a
</p>
<p>laser (published in Physical Review Letters, February 2016). Four Nobel Prizes in
</p>
<p>the last four years for achievements in physics and chemistry (see Sect. 1.9 of the
</p>
<p>book) demonstrate the significance of lasers for scientific research. There is a steady
</p>
<p>development of lasers and of their use in scientific research in physics, chemistry,
</p>
<p>engineering, biophysics, medicine, and technical applications. Important progress
</p>
<p>has been made in the last years in the development and application of infrared and
</p>
<p>far-infrared free-electron lasers, and of X-ray free-electron lasers. X-ray free-electron
</p>
<p>lasers are opening new possibilities in scientific research and in application.
</p>
<p>The first edition of the textbook Basics of Laser Physics presented a modulation
</p>
<p>model of a free-electron laser, illustrating dynamical processes in a free-electron
</p>
<p>laser. The second edition gives a modified treatment of the model. The model
</p>
<p>provides analytical expressions for the gain and for the saturation field of radiation
</p>
<p>in a free-electron laser. The results drawn from the modulation model are consistent
</p>
<p>with the results of theory that is based on Maxwell&rsquo;s equations; main results
</p>
<p>of theory arise from numerical solutions of Maxwell&rsquo;s equations. In accord with the
</p>
<p>modulation model is a description of the active medium of a free-electron laser as a
</p>
<p>quantum system, already discussed in the first edition: an electron, which performs
</p>
<p>an oscillation in a spatially periodic magnetic field, may be describable as an
</p>
<p>electron occupying an energy level of an energy-ladder system; accordingly,
</p>
<p>electronic transitions between the energy levels are origin of spontaneous and
</p>
<p>stimulated emission of radiation.
</p>
<p>In order to stress features that are common to a conventional laser and a
</p>
<p>free-electron laser or show differences, various points are clearly structured in the
</p>
<p>new edition, such as the role of dephasing between a radiation field and an oscillator
</p>
<p>or Lorentzian-like functions (denoted as &ldquo;Lorentz functions&rdquo;) describing frequency
</p>
<p>dependences of gain near or outside resonances. The second edition contains
</p>
<p>additionally: classical oscillator model of a laser (van der Pol equation of a laser);
</p>
<p>onset of laser oscillation of a titanium&ndash;sapphire laser; discussion of differences
</p>
<p>between a conventional laser and a free-electron laser; and a modification of the
</p>
<p>description of the yet hypothetical Bloch laser.
</p>
<p>vii</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Additional problems should provide a deepening of the understanding of lasers.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, errors are corrected. The principle of the overall representation
</p>
<p>remains unchanged: this book is designed in a way that a student can study many
</p>
<p>of the chapters without special knowledge of the preceding chapters. In most
</p>
<p>chapters, the content develops from a more general aspect to specific aspects. Let
</p>
<p>me mention a particular point-concerning notation. I am using, besides the letter
</p>
<p>N for the number of particles per unit volume, the letter Z for the number (=Zahl,
</p>
<p>German) of photons per unit volume, instead of common combinations of a Latin
</p>
<p>and a Greek letter, or of an upper- and a lower-case letter.
</p>
<p>I am indebted to Manfred Helm for a number of very helpful comments to the
</p>
<p>first edition and Joachim Keller for discussions of basic questions concerning the
</p>
<p>free-electron laser. I would like to thank Sergey Ganichev, Rupert Huber, Alfons
</p>
<p>Penzkofer, Willli Prettl, and Stephan Winnerl for discussions. It is a pleasure to
</p>
<p>acknowledge encouragement by Claus Ascheron and the friendly collaboration with
</p>
<p>Adelheid Duhm and Elke Sauer at Springer Verlag. I thank Sameena Begum Khan
</p>
<p>and her production team at Springer Verlag for the commitment to the preparation
</p>
<p>of the book. Finally, I would like to thank my wife Marianne for her patience.

</p>
<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>We will ask and partly answer a few questions. What is the difference between a
</p>
<p>laser and a light bulb? In which frequency ranges are lasers available? Which are the
</p>
<p>sizes and the costs of lasers? Why is it necessary to have different types of lasers in
</p>
<p>the same frequency range? We will also mention some specific lasers and we will
</p>
<p>discuss the concept of the book.
</p>
<p>1.1 Laser and Light Bulb
</p>
<p>The spatial and temporal coherence makes the difference between a laser and a light
</p>
<p>bulb (Fig. 1.1). While a lamp emits uncorrelated wave trains into all spatial directions,
</p>
<p>a laser generates coherent waves and the waves can have a high directionality. Which
</p>
<p>are the possibilities of generation of spatially and temporally coherent waves? A laser
</p>
<p>can generate a coherent continuous wave or a coherent pulse train. Extreme cases of
</p>
<p>generation of visible radiation are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; The continuous wave laser (cw laser) emits a continuous electromagnetic wave.
</p>
<p>The field is spatially and temporally coherent.
</p>
<p>&bull; The femtosecond laser emits an electromagnetic wave consisting of a pulse train;
</p>
<p>the duration of a single pulse of a train can be as short as 5 fs (1 fs = 1 femtosecond
</p>
<p>= 10&minus;15 s). The field of a pulse train is spatially and temporally coherent too.
</p>
<p>Besides continuous wave lasers and femtosecond lasers, there are pulsed lasers pro-
</p>
<p>ducing laser pulses with durations in the picosecond, nanosecond, microsecond, or
</p>
<p>millisecond ranges. We use the abbreviations:
</p>
<p>&bull; 1 ms = 1 millisecond = 10&minus;3 s
</p>
<p>&bull; 1μs = 1 microsecond = 10&minus;6 s
</p>
<p>&bull; 1 ns = 1 nanosecond = 10&minus;9 s
</p>
<p>&bull; 1 ps = 1 picosecond = 10&minus;12 s

<p>The acronym LASER means: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of
</p>
<p>Radiation. It developed to laser = device for generation of coherent electromagnetic
</p>
<p>waves by stimulated emission of radiation. The maser (=microwave laser) makes
</p>
<p>use of microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.
</p>
<p>1.2 Spectral Ranges of Lasers and List of a Few Lasers
</p>
<p>Figure 1.2 shows wavelengths and frequencies of spectral ranges of the electromag-
</p>
<p>netic spectrum&mdash;from X-rays over the ultraviolet (UV), the visible, the near infrared
</p>
<p>(NIR), the far infrared (FIR) spectral ranges to microwaves and radiowaves. The
</p>
<p>frequency ν of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum obeys the relation
</p>
<p>ν = c/λ, (1.1)
</p>
<p>where c (= 3 &times; 108 m s&minus;1) is the speed of light and λ the wavelength. Abbreviations
</p>
<p>of frequencies are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; 1 MHz = 1 megahertz = 106 Hz
</p>
<p>&bull; 1 GHz = 1 gigahertz = 109 Hz
</p>
<p>&bull; 1 THz = 1 terahertz = 1012 Hz
</p>
<p>&bull; 1 PHz = 1 petahertz = 1015 Hz
</p>
<p>The visible spectral range corresponds to a frequency range of about 430&ndash;750 THz
</p>
<p>(wavelength range about 400&ndash;700 nm). Optics and light refer to electromagnetic
</p>
<p>waves with vacuum wavelengths smaller than about 1 mm, i.e., with frequencies
</p>
<p>above 300 GHz. Lasers are available in the ultraviolet, visible, near infrared, far
</p>
<p>infrared, and microwave regions. Lasers of the range of X-rays are being developed.
</p>
<p>The spectral ranges in which lasers are available extend from the GHz range over
</p>
<p>the THz range to the region above 1,000 THz.

<p>The ancient Greeks understood μ ǫ γ α (mega) as something that was exceeding
</p>
<p>all measurable things, γ ι γ α (giga) had to do with the giants, τ ǫ ρ a (tera) included</p>

<p>wavelength and the power (from the nW range to the 100 mW range) of radiation
</p>
<p>generated by a semiconductor laser depend on its design. A stack of semiconductor
</p>
<p>lasers can produce radiation with a power up to the kW range.
</p>
<p>&bull; Quantum cascade laser (QCL). A QCL is a type of semiconductor laser that
</p>
<p>produces radiation in the infrared or in the far infrared. The laser wavelength of a
</p>
<p>quantum cascade laser depends on its design.
</p>
<p>Table 1.2 shows data of a few pulsed lasers: tp = pulse duration = halfwidth of
</p>
<p>a pulse on the time scale=FWHM= full width at half maximum; Wp = energy
</p>
<p>of radiation in a pulse=pulse energy; pulse power=Wp/tp; νrep = repetition rate;
</p>
<p>Pav = average power.
</p>
<p>&bull; Excimer laser. It is able to produce UV radiation pulses of high pulse power;
</p>
<p>the wavelength given in the table is that of a laser operated with XeF excimers.
</p>
<p>Excimers with other materials generate radiation at other wavelengths (XeCl, λ =
</p>
<p>308 nm; KrF, 248 nm; ArF, 193 nm).
</p>
<p>&bull; Neodymium YAG laser. Depending on the design of a pulsed neodymium YAG
</p>
<p>laser, the pulse duration can have a value between 5 ps or a value that is larger than
</p>
<p>that given in the table. The average power can be larger than 10 W.
</p>
<p>&bull; Titanium&ndash;sapphire femtosecond laser. The power is large during very short time
</p>
<p>intervals.
</p>
<p>A laser system, consisting of a laser oscillator and a laser amplifier, can generate
</p>
<p>radiation pulses of much larger pulse power levels (Sect. 16.8).
</p>
<p>1.3 Laser Safety
</p>
<p>Laser safety has to be taken very seriously: a laser emitting visible radiation of 1 mW
</p>
<p>power leads to a power density in the focus (area λ2) of a lens&mdash;for instance, in
</p>
<p>the focus of the lens of an eye&mdash;of the order of 109 W m&minus;2 (105 W cm&minus;2). Such a
</p>
<p>power density can lead to damage of an eye. Dear reader, please take care of the
</p>
<p>corresponding safety rules when you experiment with a laser!</p>

<p>1.4 Sizes of Lasers, Cost of Lasers, and Laser Market 7
</p>
<p>1.4 Sizes of Lasers, Cost of Lasers, and Laser Market
</p>
<p>There are lasers of very different size.
</p>
<p>&bull; A gas laser or a solid state laser has a typical length of 1 m (down to 10 cm). The
</p>
<p>price of a laser is between 100 US dollars and 1 million dollars.
</p>
<p>&bull; A free-electron laser has a typical length of 10 m (not taking account of a much
</p>
<p>larger accelerator). The price of a free-electron laser lies, depending on its prop-
</p>
<p>erties, between 10 million and billions of dollars.
</p>
<p>&bull; The smallest lasers are semiconductor lasers with sizes ranging from about 1 mm
</p>
<p>to smaller sizes. Microlasers with dimensions of the order of 10μm can be fab-
</p>
<p>ricated; nanolasers&mdash;with extensions below 1μm&mdash;may be suitable for special
</p>
<p>applications. Mass production (at a price of 10 dollars per laser or much less)
</p>
<p>resulted in a great variety of applications of semiconductor lasers.
</p>
<p>The laser market (Fig. 1.3a) is strongly growing. The development may be similar
</p>
<p>as for the computer market. After the discovery of the transistor in 1946, it took
</p>
<p>about 50 years until the transistor became widely distributed&mdash;as the essential basis
</p>
<p>of a computer. The main breakthrough was due to miniaturization realized in the
</p>
<p>microelectronics and due to integration of transistors in large systems. The laser,
</p>
<p>with its first operation 14 years after the transistor, is beginning to be widely spread

<p>8 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>as a part of devices of the daily life. The integration of the lasers in other devices and
</p>
<p>in large systems became possible by the development of the semiconductor lasers
</p>
<p>and their miniaturization.
</p>
<p>The laser market offers a large variety of different lasers designed for particu-
</p>
<p>lar applications. The laser field is in a rapid development; improvements of laser
</p>
<p>designs, new types of lasers, and new applications make the field strongly growing.
</p>
<p>We mention here the industrial lasers, machines suitable for various applications.
</p>
<p>In 2009, the main contributions to the turnover in the market of industrial lasers
</p>
<p>(Fig. 1.3b) came from the CO2 lasers, the excimer lasers, and the solid state lasers
</p>
<p>(including a small portion of semiconductor lasers). Among the solid state lasers,
</p>
<p>there are different types, namely rod lasers, disk lasers, and fiber lasers. Industrial
</p>
<p>lasers find use in materials processing&mdash;cutting, welding, marking, engraving, and
</p>
<p>microprocessing; today (2016), disk lasers reach high output power levels and are
</p>
<p>developing as simple powerful industrial lasers. A main application of excimer lasers
</p>
<p>concerns structuring of semiconductors. The overall turnover of industrial lasers was
</p>
<p>about nine billion dollars in 2010. Most installations of industrial lasers (Fig. 1.3c)
</p>
<p>are in Asia, Europe, and North America.
</p>
<p>Lasers are the basis of photonics ( = photoelectronics) and optics. Optoelectron-
</p>
<p>ics&mdash;the counterpart at optical frequencies to electronics at radio and microwave
</p>
<p>frequencies&mdash;and integrated optics refer to optical systems used in optical commu-
</p>
<p>nications, signal processing, sensing with radiation, and other fields. A characteristic
</p>
<p>of optoelectronics is the extension of methods of electronics to the range of optical
</p>
<p>frequencies.
</p>
<p>Semiconductor lasers used in data communications and in consumer applications
</p>
<p>are produced at a rate of more than one million in a week (at a prize of about 1 US $ per
</p>
<p>piece); these lasers are mainly edge-emitting lasers (Sects. 20.5 and 25.4). More than
</p>
<p>one million lasers per month are produced for the telecommunication market. The
</p>
<p>lasers for the telecommunication market have a higher level of sophistication and are
</p>
<p>produced in 2011 at a price of about $10 per piece; the lasers used in telecommunica-
</p>
<p>tion systems are mainly vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, VCSELs (Sect. 22.7).
</p>
<p>1.5 Questions about the Laser
</p>
<p>In this book, we will answer a number of questions about the laser. Here we list some
</p>
<p>questions answered in different chapters of the book.
</p>
<p>&bull; What is common to all lasers?
</p>
<p>Answer: common to all lasers is the generation of radiation of high directionality;
</p>
<p>the generation is due to stimulated emission of radiation either by quantum systems
</p>
<p>such as atoms and molecules or by oscillating free-electrons.
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the working principle of the free-electron laser?
</p>
<p>&bull; How can we generate monochromatic radiation?</p>

<p>1.5 Questions About the Laser 9
</p>
<p>&bull; How can we generate femtosecond pulses?
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the role of diffraction in a laser? We will see that diffraction plays an
</p>
<p>important and favorable role: diffraction can suppress unwanted radiation.
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the angle of divergence of laser radiation? The angle of divergence is in
</p>
<p>general not determined by diffraction but by a kind of natural beams&mdash;Gaussian
</p>
<p>beams&mdash;that fit perfectly to resonators with two spherical mirrors. A laser is able
</p>
<p>to generate a Gaussian beam.
</p>
<p>&bull; How can we produce laser radiation in different ranges of the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>spectrum?
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the difference between a laser and a classical oscillator?
</p>
<p>Laser physics connects optics with atomic physics, molecular physics, solid state
</p>
<p>physics (including semiconductor physics), and, of course, quantum mechanics, and
</p>
<p>furthermore with engineering, chemistry, biology, and medicine.
</p>
<p>1.6 Different Types of Lasers in the Same Spectral Range
</p>
<p>Why do we need different types of lasers for the same spectral range? Different types
</p>
<p>of lasers fulfill different tasks.
</p>
<p>&bull; If we need lasers of CD (compact disk) or blue ray players, semiconductor lasers,
</p>
<p>with small sizes and low power consumption, fulfill the task.
</p>
<p>&bull; To cut metal plates, a high power laser as the CO2 laser is suitable. The efficiency of
</p>
<p>conversion of electric power to radiation power of a CO2 laser is large (larger than
</p>
<p>10%). The CO2 laser emits radiation in the infrared spectral region. High power
</p>
<p>disk lasers (pumped with semiconductor lasers) emitting near infrared radiation
</p>
<p>have also high efficiencies for conversion of electric energy to radiation. These
</p>
<p>lasers may become able (2016) to compete with CO2 lasers.
</p>
<p>&bull; To generate femtosecond optical pulses, with durations from 100 to 5 fs, only few
</p>
<p>of the many lasers have appropriate properties. The most prominent femtosecond
</p>
<p>laser is the titanium&ndash;sapphire femtosecond laser.
</p>
<p>Large progress came with the miniaturized semiconductor lasers but also with
</p>
<p>the high-power semiconductor lasers&mdash;that can be applied, for example, as pump
</p>
<p>sources of other lasers.
</p>

</p>
<p>General description of a laser and an example. We will describe main properties

<p>10 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.4 Concept of the
book
</p>
<p>an electromagnetic field in a resonator. Early in the book we will discuss a particular
</p>
<p>laser (the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser) in some detail. This allows us to be specific, if
</p>
<p>necessary, during a treatment of the theory and the discussion of the operation of a
</p>
<p>laser.
</p>
<p>Theory of the laser. To describe the interaction of light with matter, we introduce
</p>
<p>the Einstein coefficients. A theoretical treatment of the laser oscillation yields the
</p>
<p>laser threshold condition and other important properties.
</p>
<p>Operation of a laser. We will mention different techniques of operation of a laser
</p>
<p>as a continuous wave laser or as a pulsed laser. We will begin this part with a treatment
</p>
<p>of the properties of resonators and the description of Gaussian waves.
</p>
<p>Lasers except semiconductor lasers
</p>
<p>&bull; Gas lasers. The active medium consists of atoms, ions, or molecules in gases. Gas
</p>
<p>lasers are available in the UV, visible, NIR, FIR, and microwave ranges. Two of
</p>
<p>the most important industrial lasers (the excimer and the CO2 laser) are gas lasers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Solid state lasers (except semiconductor lasers). The active medium consists of ions
</p>
<p>in a dielectric solid; the solid is a host for ions. Solid state lasers, operated at room
</p>
<p>temperature, are available in the visible and the near infrared. Stimulated transitions
</p>
<p>between electronic states of ions give rise to generation of laser radiation. Besides
</p>
<p>crystals, other condensed matter materials&mdash;glasses, polymers, and liquids&mdash;are
</p>
<p>also suitable as host materials of ions, atoms, or molecules.
</p>
<p>&bull; Free-electron lasers. The basis is the emission of radiation by oscillating free-
</p>
<p>electrons. The electrons are passing at a velocity near the speed of light through
</p>
<p>a spatially periodic magnetic field. Free-electron lasers are available in the vis-
</p>
<p>ible, infrared, and far infrared; free-electron lasers generating X-rays are being
</p>
<p>developed.
</p>
<p>Semiconductor lasers (bipolar semiconductor lasers andquantumcascade lasers).
</p>
<p>Semiconductor lasers are solid state lasers that use conduction electrons in semicon-
</p>
<p>ductors. Semiconductor lasers are available in the visible, near UV, and NIR spectral
</p>
<p>ranges and are being developed for the FIR. Stimulated transitions are either due
</p>
<p>to electronic transitions between the conduction band and the valence band of a</p>

<p>1.7 Concept of the Book 11
</p>
<p>semiconductor&mdash;in bipolar lasers&mdash;or between subbands of a conduction band&mdash;in
</p>
<p>quantum cascade lasers. Preparation of mixed semiconductor materials and of het-
</p>
<p>erostructures makes it possible to realize new, artificial materials that are used in
</p>
<p>quantum well, quantum wire, quantum dot, and quantum cascade lasers. The laser
</p>
<p>wavelength is adjustable through an appropriate design of a heterostructure. We will,
</p>
<p>furthermore, present the idea of a Bloch laser ( = superlattice Bloch laser = Bloch
</p>
<p>oscillator) that may become suitable for generation of FIR radiation.
</p>
<p>Laser-related topics
</p>
<p>&bull; Optical communications. This is an important field of applications of semicon-
</p>
<p>ductor lasers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Light emitting diode (LED). The LED is the basis of many different kinds of
</p>
<p>illumination. The development of LEDs is going on in parallel to the development
</p>
<p>of semiconductor lasers. The organic LED (OLED) is suited to realize simple large
</p>
<p>area light sources.
</p>
<p>&bull; Nonlinear Optics. We will give a short introduction to the field of Nonlinear Optics.
</p>
<p>Our main aspect will be: how can we convert coherent laser radiation of one
</p>
<p>frequency to coherent radiation of other frequencies?
</p>
<p>We will discuss various applications in connection with different topics.

<p>versity) at the Ann Arbor Conference on Optical Pumping in 1959. In his thesis
</p>
<p>(Moscow 1940&mdash;unknown until 1959) Vladimir Fabrikant discussed amplification
</p>
<p>of optical radiation by stimulated emission of radiation.
</p>
<p>In 1951, Charles Townes, searching for an oscillator generating microwave radi-
</p>
<p>ation at higher frequencies than other microwave oscillators (magnetron, klystron)
</p>
<p>available at the time, had the idea of a maser [21]&mdash;based on three aspects (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 2.1): stimulated emission of radiation by an atomic system; creation of a pop-
</p>
<p>ulation inversion (in a molecular beam); feedback of radiation by use of a resonator.
</p>
<p>The realization of the first maser (1954) stimulated the development of other types
</p>
<p>of masers, particularly of the solid state three-level maser. In 1958, Schawlow and
</p>
<p>Townes published an article on &ldquo;infrared and optical masers.&rdquo; This paper described
</p>
<p>the conditions of operation of a laser (Chap. 8) and initiated the search for a concrete
</p>
<p>laser. Maiman was the first to operate a laser, the ruby laser, in May 1960. Later in
</p>
<p>the year, Javan reported operation of a helium&ndash;neon laser.
</p>
<p>The application for a laser patent in mid-1958 by Bell Laboratories, with
</p>
<p>Schawlow (at Bell Laboratories) and Townes (Columbia University) as inventors,
</p>
<p>led to the first US patent on a laser, issued in 1960. A student, Gordon Gould, then
</p>
<p>working in a group at Columbia University on his PhD thesis, wrote in several note-
</p>

</p>
<p>After many court cases, Gould succeeded to obtain patents on various aspects of
</p>
<p>lasers. Since it took a very long time to be issued (in 1976, 1978, 1988, and 1989),
</p>
<p>the patents allowed Gould and several companies he co-founded to get back the
</p>
<p>money (several tens of millions of dollars). For this purpose, laser companies were
</p>
<p>forced by further court cases to pay license fee.
</p>
<p>The theoretical basis of the laser was the &ldquo;old quantum mechanics&rdquo; developed
</p>
<p>(1900&ndash;1917) by Planck, Bohr, and Einstein. The main results of the &ldquo;old quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics&rdquo; obtained a consequent founding by the quantum mechanics (developed
</p>
<p>1925&ndash;1928). Why did it last about 40 years until maser and laser were operating?
</p>
<p>This question will be discussed in Sect. 9.13.

<p>Laser Principle
</p>
<p>A laser (=laser oscillator) is a self-excited oscillator. A self-excited oscillator starts
</p>
<p>oscillation by itself and maintains an oscillation. Laser radiation is generated by
</p>
<p>stimulated transitions in an active medium. The active medium is a gain medium&mdash;
</p>
<p>propagation of radiation in the active medium results in an increase of the energy
</p>
<p>density of the radiation. The active medium in a laser experiences feedback from
</p>
<p>radiation stored in a laser resonator.Aportion of radiation coupled out of the resonator
</p>
<p>represents the useful radiation.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we characterize an active medium by a population inversion in an
</p>
<p>ensemble of two-level atomic systems. We formulate the threshold condition of laser
</p>
<p>oscillation. We solve the resonator eigenvalue problem and find possible frequencies
</p>
<p>of laser oscillation. We also show that the buildup of steady state oscillation of a
</p>
<p>laser takes time&mdash;the oscillation onset time.
</p>
<p>To describe a coherent electromagnetic wave, we make use of the model of a
</p>
<p>quasiplane wave&mdash;a parallel beam of coherent radiation. A quasiplane wave is char-
</p>
<p>acterized by a well-defined propagation direction, a finite spatial extension perpen-
</p>
<p>dicular to the propagation direction, and a constant field amplitude within the beam.
</p>
<p>The model is very useful for a basic description of the field in a laser oscillator. Later
</p>
<p>(in Chap.11) we will introduce a modified description of a coherent electromagnetic
</p>
<p>wave.
</p>
<p>In later chapters, wewill specify the two-level atomic systems. A two-level atomic
</p>
<p>system can belong to various states: electronic states of an atom or an ion (in a gas,
</p>
<p>crystal, glass, or liquid); electronic, vibrational, or rotational states of a molecule;
</p>
<p>electronic states of electrons in a semiconductor or a semiconductor heterostructure.
</p>
<p>Wewill introduce (Chap. 4) still another typeof activemedium&mdash;anactivemedium
</p>
<p>containing energy-ladder systems rather than two-level systems.

</p>
<p>2.1 A Laser
</p>
<p>A laser (Fig. 2.1) emits coherent radiation of an output power Pout. A laser has the
</p>
<p>following parts.
</p>
<p>&bull; Active medium (=gain medium = laser medium). The active medium is able to
</p>
<p>amplify electromagnetic radiation. The active medium, located inside a resonator,
</p>
<p>fills out a resonator partly or completely.
</p>
<p>&bull; Pump system. It &ldquo;pumps&rdquo; the active medium. Methods of pumping are: optical
</p>
<p>pumpingwith another laser or a lamp; pumpingwith a gas discharge; pumpingwith
</p>
<p>a current through a semiconductor or a semiconductor heterostructure; chemical
</p>
<p>pumping.
</p>
<p>&bull; Laser resonator. The laser resonator has the task to store a coherent electromag-
</p>
<p>netic field and to enable the field to interact with the active medium&mdash;the active
</p>
<p>medium experiences feedback from the coherent field.Wewill describe resonators
</p>
<p>that consist of two mirrors&mdash;one is a reflector of a reflectivity R1 near 1, and the
</p>
<p>other is a partial reflector serving as output coupler. The output coupling mir-
</p>
<p>ror has a reflectivity (R2) that also can have a value near 1 but that can be much
</p>
<p>smaller; semiconductor lasers can have reflectors with R1 = R2 &sim; 0.3. Each type
</p>
<p>of laser requires its own resonator design. There is a main criterion concerning
</p>
<p>reflectivities of resonators: a laser should be able to work at all. Depending on the
</p>
<p>task of a laser, other criteria can be chosen&mdash;for instance, that a laser should have
</p>
<p>optimum efficiency of conversion of pump power to laser output power.
</p>
<p>2.2 Coherent Electromagnetic Wave
</p>
<p>We describe a coherent electromagnetic wave generated by a continuous wave laser
</p>
<p>as a quasiplane wave (=parallel beam of coherent light),
</p>
<p>E(z, t) = A cos[ω(t &minus; t0)&minus; k(z &minus; z0)]. (2.1)
</p>
<p>E is the electric field at time t and location z, A is the amplitude,ω = 2πν the angular
</p>
<p>frequency, ν the frequency, and k the wave vector of the wave; t0 defines a time</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2 Coherent Electromagnetic Wave 19
</p>
<p>coordinate and z0 a spatial coordinate. The direction of E (and A) is perpendicular
</p>
<p>to the direction of the propagation direction (z direction). The dispersion relation,
</p>
<p>ω = ck, (2.2)
</p>
<p>relates the frequency and the wave vector. The quasiplane wave has a finite lateral
</p>
<p>extension. We suppose that the amplitude of the field does not vary, at a fixed z, over
</p>
<p>the cross section and that it is independent of z. The quasiplane wave is a section of a
</p>
<p>plane wave (which has infinite extensions in the plane perpendicular to the direction
</p>
<p>of propagation).
</p>
<p>If we choose t0 = 0 and z0 = 0 to describe a quasiplane wave propagating in free
</p>
<p>space, we can write
</p>
<p>E(z, t) = A cos(ωt &minus; kz). (2.3)
</p>
<p>The instantaneous energy density, uinst, in the electromagnetic field is
</p>
<p>uinst = ε0 A
2 cos2(ωt &minus; kz), (2.4)
</p>
<p>where ε0 is the electric field constant. The energy density u of the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>field, that is, the instantaneous energy density averaged over a temporal period T =
</p>
<p>2π/ω, is equal to
</p>
<p>u =
1
</p>
<p>2
ε0 A
</p>
<p>2. (2.5)
</p>
<p>The quasiplane wave transports energy in z direction. The power P of the wave is
</p>
<p>P =
1
</p>
<p>2
cε0 A
</p>
<p>2a1a2, (2.6)
</p>
<p>where a1a2 is the cross-sectional area of a beam of rectangular shape. The intensity
</p>
<p>(= power per unit area = energy flux density) is
</p>
<p>I =
P
</p>
<p>a1a2
=
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
cε0 A
</p>
<p>2. (2.7)
</p>
<p>We interpret the transport of radiation energy as a flux of photons along the
</p>
<p>z direction and introduce the average number of photons per unit of volume, the
</p>
<p>photon density Z , by the relation
</p>
<p>u = Zhν = Z�ω. (2.8)
</p>
<p>The energy density is equal to the photon density times the photon energy hν.
</p>
<p>Simplifying further, we describe a light beam of laser light as a parallel bundle of
</p>
<p>light rays (Fig. 2.2). To characterize the propagation of light within a parallel light
</p>
<p>bundle, we introduce the disk of light. It is a section of a light bundle and has the
</p>
<p>length δz; we assume that δz is much larger than the wavelength of the radiation,</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>20 2 Laser Principle
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.2 Parallel light
</p>
<p>bundle and disk of light
</p>
<p>δz ≫ λ. The disk of light propagates along the z direction with the speed of light.
</p>
<p>The energy density in a disk of light is u(ν, z) and the photon density is equal to
</p>
<p>Z(ν, z) =
u(ν, z)
</p>
<p>hν
. (2.9)
</p>
<p>We will make use of the complex notation of the field. A complex field Ẽ corre-
</p>
<p>sponds to a real field according to the relation
</p>
<p>E = Re[Ẽ] =
1
</p>
<p>2
(Ẽ + Ẽ&lowast;) =
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
Ẽ + c.c., (2.10)
</p>
<p>where Re[Ẽ] is the real part of Ẽ . The real field is equal to the sum of Ẽ /2 and its
</p>
<p>conjugate complex (c.c.) Ẽ&lowast;/2.
</p>
<p>The real part of a complex field, which is the product of a complex quantity Ã
</p>
<p>and another complex quantity K̃ , is
</p>
<p>E = Re[Ẽ] =
1
</p>
<p>2
( Ã&lowast; K̃ + ÃK̃ &lowast;) =
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
Ã&lowast; K̃ + c.c. (2.11)
</p>
<p>The complex field Ẽ = A ei(ωt&minus;kz), with the real amplitude A, corresponds to the real
</p>
<p>field E = A cos(ωt &minus; kz). It follows that the energy density in an electromagnetic
</p>
<p>field is
</p>
<p>u =
ε0
</p>
<p>2
Ẽ Ẽ&lowast; =
</p>
<p>ε0
</p>
<p>2
|Ẽ |2 =
</p>
<p>ε0
</p>
<p>2
A2. (2.12)
</p>
<p>The photon density is given by
</p>
<p>Z =
ε0
</p>
<p>2hν
Ẽ Ẽ&lowast; =
</p>
<p>ε0
</p>
<p>2hν
|Ẽ |2 =
</p>
<p>ε0
</p>
<p>2hν
A2. (2.13)
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the amplitude of the field is
</p>
<p>A =
&radic;
</p>
<p>2hνZ/ε0. (2.14)
</p>
<p>More generally, we can characterize a quasiplane wave by
</p>
<p>E = A cos[ω(t &minus; t0)&minus; kz + ϕ0], (2.15)</p>

<p>Ẽ = A ei[ω(t&minus;t0)&minus;kz+ϕ0]. (2.16)
</p>
<p>If a wave propagates in a dielectric medium (dielectric constant ε), then ε0 has to be
</p>
<p>replaced by εε0 in the expressions concerning u, Z , A, and intensity.
</p>
<p>The transit of coherent radiation through an active medium (Fig. 2.3) results in an
</p>
<p>increase of the photon density,
</p>
<p>Z = G1Z0, (2.17)
</p>
<p>and of the energy density,
</p>
<p>u = G1u0. (2.18)
</p>
<p>G1 (&gt;1) is the single-pass gain factor. Z0 is the photon density and u0 the energy
</p>
<p>density in the incident beam. Z is the photon density and u the energy density in the
</p>
<p>beam after passing through the active medium. We write
</p>
<p>G1 = e
αL , (2.19)

<p>We can interpret the absorption coefficient as a negative gain coefficient; for units of

</p>
<p>An active medium can have a gain coefficient that has a maximum αmax at a
</p>
<p>resonance frequency ν0 (Fig. 2.4a). The gain coefficient decreases toward smaller
</p>
<p>and larger frequencies and remains positive. However, an active medium can have
</p>
<p>a gain coefficient that changes sign (Fig. 2.4b). Such a medium has a transparency

</p>
<p>at frequencies ν &gt; νtr.
</p>
<p>2.3 An Active Medium
</p>
<p>An atom (or molecule) used in a laser has two laser levels, besides other energy
</p>
<p>levels. We ignore for the moment the other levels and describe an atom as a two-level
</p>
<p>atomic system (Fig. 2.5) and accordingly an ensemble of atoms as an ensemble of
</p>
<p>two-level atomic systems. We introduce the following notation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Level 2 (energy E2) = upper laser level.
</p>
<p>&bull; Level 1 (energy E1) = lower laser level.
</p>
<p>&bull; E21 = E2 &minus; E1 = energy difference between the two laser levels = transition
</p>
<p>energy.
</p>
<p>&bull; N2 = population of level 2 = density of excited two-level atomic systems =
</p>
<p>number density (number per unit volume) of excited two-level atomic systems.
</p>
<p>&bull; N1 = population of level 1 = density of unexcited two-level atomic systems.
</p>
<p>&bull; N2 &minus; N1 = population difference.
</p>
<p>&bull; N1 + N2 = density of two-level atomic systems.
</p>
<p>Monochromatic electromagnetic radiation of frequency ν can interact with a two-
</p>
<p>level atomic system if Bohr&rsquo;s energy-frequency relation
</p>
<p>hν = E21 = E2 &minus; E1 (2.25)</p>

<p>holds, that is, if the photon energy hν of the photons of the radiation field is equal
</p>
<p>to the energy difference E21. But because of lifetime broadening of the upper level,
</p>
<p>a two-level atomic system can also interact if hν is unequal to E21.
</p>
<p>Two processes are competing with each other in a laser, absorption and stimulated
</p>
<p>emission of radiation. In an absorption process (Fig. 2.6), a photon is converted to
</p>
<p>excitation energy of a two-level atomic system by a 1&rarr; 2 transition. An excited two-
</p>
<p>level atomic system transfers by a stimulated emission process its excitation energy
</p>
<p>to the light field. Einstein showed: Radiation created by stimulated emission has the
</p>
<p>same frequency, direction, polarization and phase as the stimulating radiation.
</p>
<p>If the active medium is an ensemble of two-level systems, the strength of stimu-
</p>

<p>We assume, for convenience, in the following that g1 = g2.)
</p>
<p>It is useful, in particular with respect to the treatment of semiconductor lasers, to
</p>
<p>make use of occupation numbers. We introduce the (relative) occupation number
</p>
<p>fi =
Ni
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>Ni
, (2.30)
</p>
<p>where Ni is the population of level i and
&sum;
</p>
<p>Ni is the sum of the populations of all
</p>
<p>levels of an ensemble of atomic systems. The sum of the relative occupation numbers
</p>
<p>of an ensemble is unity,
&sum;
</p>
<p>fi = 1. The relative occupation number fi is equal to the
</p>
<p>probability that level i is occupied.
</p>
<p>The relative occupation number of the upper laser level (Fig. 2.7) is equal to
</p>
<p>f2 =
N2
</p>
<p>N1 + N2
, (2.31)
</p>
<p>and the relative occupation number of the lower laser level is
</p>
<p>f1 =
N1
</p>
<p>N1 + N2
. (2.32)
</p>
<p>The sum of the relative occupation numbers is unity,
</p>
<p>f2 + f1 = 1. (2.33)
</p>
<p>The occupation number difference (that is the difference between two probabilities) is
</p>
<p>f2 &minus; f1 =
N2 &minus; N1
</p>
<p>N1 + N2
. (2.34)
</p>
<p>The occupation number difference is the ratio of the population difference N2 &minus; N1

<p>is equal to the occupation number difference times the density of two-level atomic
</p>

<p>It follows that the strength of stimulated emission of radiation is proportional to
</p>
<p>f2, and that the strength of absorption of radiation is proportional to f1. The net
</p>
<p>effect&mdash;the difference between the strength of stimulated emission and absorption&mdash;
</p>
<p>is proportional to f2 &minus; f1. Stimulated emission prevails if
</p>
<p>f2 &minus; f1 &gt; 0, (2.36)
</p>
<p>while absorption prevails if f2 &minus; f1 &lt; 0. The condition f2 &minus; f1 &gt; 0 is again the
</p>
<p>condition of gain. We can write the transparency condition in the form:
</p>
<p>f2 &minus; f1 = 0; (2.37)
</p>
<p>amedium is transparent if the occupation number difference (more accurately: the rel-
</p>
<p>ative occupation number difference) is zero. The corresponding density of two-level
</p>
<p>atomic systems in the upper laser level is the transparency density Ntr (= N2,tr).
</p>
<p>A population inversion corresponds to a nonequilibrium state of an ensemble of
</p>
<p>two-level atomic systems. At thermal equilibrium, the population N2 of an ensemble
</p>
<p>of two-level atomic systems is always smaller than the population N1.
</p>
<p>Thermal equilibrium of many media containing an ensemble of atomic systems
</p>
<p>is governed by Boltzmann&rsquo;s statistics. If Boltzmann&rsquo;s statistics holds, the ratio of the
</p>
<p>population of the upper level and the population of the lower level is given by
</p>
<p>N2
</p>
<p>N1
= e&minus;(E2&minus;E1)/kT , (2.38)
</p>
<p>where k (= 1.38 &times; 10&minus;23 J K&minus;1) is Boltzmann&rsquo;s constant and T the temperature of
</p>
<p>the ensemble. At thermal equilibrium, the population difference is always negative,
</p>
<p>N2 &minus; N1 &lt; 0; the net effect of stimulated emission and absorption of radiation results
</p>
<p>in damping of radiation at the frequency ν &sim; (E2 &minus; E1)/h. For an ensemble of two-
</p>
<p>level atomic systems, which obeys Boltzmann&rsquo;s statistics, the occupation number of
</p>
<p>the upper level is equal to
</p>
<p>f Boltz2 =
N2
</p>
<p>N1 + N2
=
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>exp[(E2 &minus; E1)/kT ] + 1

<p>and the occupation number of the lower level is

<p>f Boltz1 =
N1
</p>
<p>N1 + N2
=
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>exp[&minus;(E2 &minus; E1)/kT ] + 1
. (2.40)
</p>
<p>At thermal equilibrium, the relative occupation number of the lower level is always
</p>
<p>larger than the relative occupation number of the upper level, f Boltz1 &minus; f
Boltz
2 &gt; 0,
</p>
<p>that is, at thermal equilibrium, absorption always exceeds stimulated emission.</p>

<p>In atomic physics and thermodynamics, the occupation number of an atomic level
</p>
<p>concerns the total number of atoms. To describe laser media, it is convenient to make
</p>
<p>use of number densities and of relative occupation numbers. In order to avoid a
</p>
<p>confusion, we mark total numbers by the suffix &ldquo;tot.&rdquo; If an ensemble of two-level
</p>
<p>systems is distributed in the volume V , we are dealing with the following quantities:
</p>
<p>&bull; N1 = density of atoms in level 1.
</p>
<p>&bull; N2 = density of atoms in level 2.
</p>
<p>&bull; N1,tot = N1 &times; V = occupation number of level 1 = total number of two-level

<p>2.4 Laser Resonator
</p>
<p>The Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator (Fig. 2.8) consists of two plane mirrors arranged in par-
</p>
<p>allel at a distance L; the Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator is an open resonator&mdash;it has no
</p>
<p>sidewalls. We consider a Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator with reflectors of rectangular shape.
</p>
<p>We choose cartesian coordinates with the z axis parallel to the resonator axis; laser

<p>radiation propagates along z. Characteristic quantities of a Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator
</p>
<p>are:
</p>
<p>&bull; a1 = width of the resonator (along x).
</p>
<p>&bull; a2 = height of the resonator (along y).
</p>
<p>&bull; L = length of the resonator (along z).
</p>
<p>&bull; z = 0 = location of mirror 1.
</p>
<p>&bull; z = L = location of mirror 2.
</p>
<p>&bull; R1 = reflectivity of mirror 1.
</p>
<p>&bull; R2 = reflectivity of mirror 2.
</p>
<p>We assume for the mirrors are perfectly reflecting (R1 = R2 = 1) and describe
</p>
<p>the laser field within a resonator as a quasiplane standing wave composed of two
</p>
<p>waves of equal amplitude and opposite propagation directions:
</p>
<p>E =

</p>
<p>2
A cos[ωt &minus; (kz &minus; ϕ0)] +
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
A cos[ωt + (kz &minus; ϕ0)]. (2.42)
</p>
<p>The field E and the amplitude A have an orientation along a direction (e.g., the
</p>
<p>x direction) perpendicular to the z direction. Using the relations cos (α &plusmn; β) =
</p>
<p>cosα cosβ ∓ sin α sin β, we can write (2.42) in the form
</p>
<p>E = A cos(kz &minus; ϕ0) cosωt, (2.43)
</p>
<p>which describes a standing wave. To find k, ω, and ϕ0, we make use of three condi-
</p>
<p>tions:
</p>
<p>&bull; The solution of the resonator eigenvalue problem provides discrete values of the
</p>
<p>wave vector.
</p>
<p>&bull; The dispersion relation for electromagnetic radiation then yields the resonance
</p>
<p>frequencies of a resonator.
</p>
<p>&bull; Two boundary conditions for electromagnetic fields provide the phase.
</p>
<p>The resonator eigenvalue problem reads: after a round trip transit through the
</p>
<p>resonator, the field at a location z at time t + T is the same as the field at time t ,
</p>
<p>E(z, t + T ) = E(z, t). (2.44)
</p>
<p>This leads to the condition
</p>
<p>2kL = l &times; 2π; l = 1, 2, 3, . . . . (2.45)
</p>
<p>The integer l is the order of a resonance. The change of phase per round trip transit
</p>
<p>is 2kL = 2π . Accordingly, the wave vector has discrete values,

<p>kl = l &times;

</p>
<p>an oscillation during a continuous motion of the bow. The string together with the
</p>
<p>bow, which steadily delivers energy to the oscillation, is a self-excited oscillator. The
</p>
<p>length of the string determines the fundamental frequency.

</p>
<p>t = 0. At the start of a laser oscillation, the energy density of the radiation is u.
</p>
<p>The energy density is equal to V Gu after one round trip (Fig. 2.12). G is the gain</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 2.13 Gain during onset of laser oscillation
</p>
<p>We describe the following case: an active medium is suddenly turned on at time
</p>
<p>t = 0.The initial gain factor isG0 (Fig. 2.13). The gain factor remains nearly constant
</p>
<p>and then decreases to the steady state valueG&infin;. The transition fromG0 toG&infin; occurs
</p>
<p>at the onset time ton, which is a measure of the time it takes to build up a steady state
</p>
<p>oscillation.G0 is the small-signal gain factor andG&infin; the large-signal gain factor. The
</p>
<p>two conditions lead to the threshold condition of laser oscillation (= laser condition):
</p>
<p>GV &ge; 1. (2.75)
</p>
<p>The condition implies that during the buildup of a laser field, G is larger than at
</p>
<p>steady state oscillation. We can also interpret the threshold condition as follows:
</p>
<p>an oscillation builds up if G0 is only slightly larger than G&infin;. In the extreme case
</p>
<p>that G0 &rarr; G&infin;, reaching a steady state takes infinitely long time (ton &rarr; &infin;). In this
</p>
<p>sense, we introduce the threshold gain factor,
</p>
<p>G th = G&infin;. (2.76)
</p>
<p>The small-signal gain factor G0 is always larger than the large-signal gain factor G&infin;
(= G th). At steady state oscillation, the gain factor is clamped at
</p>
<p>G&infin; = V
&minus;1. (2.77)
</p>
<p>We will treat onset of oscillation in more detail (Sects. 2.9, 8.4, and 9.7; Fig. 9.6).
</p>
<p>A laser is a regenerative amplifier: at steady state oscillation, radiation lost during a
</p>
<p>round trip transit through the resonator is regenerated after the round trip.
</p>
<p>The energy density of radiation in a lossless resonator of a continuously pumped
</p>
<p>laser increases to infinitely large values&mdash;but optical damage limits the energy density

</p>
<p>At steady state oscillation, the electric field at a fixed location in the laser resonator
</p>
<p>reproduces itself after each round trip transit through the resonator; this is the res-
</p>
<p>onator eigenvalue problem in the case that a resonator contains an active medium.
</p>
<p>The electric field in a resonator (Fig. 2.14) has to obey the condition
</p>
<p>G̃EṼE exp(&minus;i(2kL &minus;∆φ &minus; ϕ3 + ϕR1 + ϕR2)) Ẽ = Ẽ . (2.78)
</p>
<p>The quantities concern a round trip transit through the active medium.
</p>
<p>&bull; G̃E = GEe
iϕ1 =complex gain factor with respect to the field.
</p>
<p>&bull; ṼE = VEe
iϕ2 =complex loss factor with respect to the field.
</p>
<p>&bull; 2kL = geometric phase shift.
</p>
<p>&bull; ϕR1 = phase shift due to reflection at one of the mirrors.
</p>
<p>&bull; ϕR2 = phase shift due to reflection at the other mirror.
</p>
<p>&bull; ϕ3 = phase shift due to dispersion in the resonator (Sect. 13.3).
</p>
<p>&bull; ∆φ= Gouy phase shift = additional phase shift occuring for radiation propagating
</p>
<p>in a resonator with curved mirrors (Sect. 11.7); the Gouy phase shift of radiation
</p>
<p>in a Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator is zero.
</p>
<p>We obtain the condition
</p>
<p>GEVE exp&minus;i(2kL &minus;∆φ &minus; ϕ3 &minus; ϕ1 &minus; ϕ2 + ϕR1 + ϕR2) = 1. (2.79)
</p>
<p>The factor to the exponential has to be equal to unity, and the sum of all phases has
</p>
<p>to be a multiple of 2π . It follows that GEVE = 1 and, with G
2
E = G and V
</p>
<p>2
E = V ,
</p>
<p>that GV = 1 as already derived in the preceding section. The second condition is
</p>
<p>2kL &minus;∆φ &minus; ϕ3 + ϕR1 + ϕR2 = l &times; 2π, (2.80)
</p>
<p>where l is an integer. The sum of all changes of phase after a round trip transit has
</p>
<p>to be a multiple of 2π . Since k = ω/c, the condition provides the eigenfrequencies
</p>
<p>ωl = 2πνl . In the special case that all additional phases&mdash;but not the geometric
</p>
<p>phase shift kz&mdash;are zero, we obtain the eigenfrequencies νl = lc/(2L), with l =1,

<p>2, &hellip;; otherwise the resonance frequencies are shifted.

<p>36 2 Laser Principle
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation propagating in a medium of refractive index n has the
</p>
<p>wave vector k = nω/c. It depends on the properties of the resonator and of the active
</p>
<p>medium at which resonance frequency (or frequencies) a laser oscillates.
</p>
<p>We will discuss the origin of phase shifts of electromagnetic wave propagating in
</p>
<p>an active medium in Chap.9 and phase shifts of an electromagnetic wave in a laser
</p>
<p>resonator in Chap.11 and Sect. 13.4.
</p>
<p>2.8 Data of Lasers
</p>
<p>Table 2.1 shows data of continuous wave lasers. The data concern the quantities (see
</p>
<p>also Fig. 2.15):
</p>
<p>&bull; L = resonator length.
</p>
<p>&bull; d = diameter in case of a circular resonator.
</p>
<p>&bull; a1 = width and a2 = height of a rectangular resonator.
</p>
<p>&bull; Resonator volume = π(d/2)2L of a circular-mirror resonator and a1a2L of a
</p>
<p>rectangular resonator.
</p>
<p>&bull; G = gain factor per round trip of the radiation; G1, per single transit.
</p>
<p>&bull; V = V factor per round trip; it indicates the reduction of the photon density in the
</p>
<p>resonator per round trip transit, and V1 loss per single transit.
</p>
<p>&bull; Pout = output power.
</p>
<p>By modifying a laser (e.g., by choosing an other cross sectional areas), it can be
</p>
<p>possible to obtain a larger or a smaller output power. The lasers generate radiation at
</p>
<p>wavelengths listed in the table but also at other wavelengths. The length of the active
</p>
<p>medium of a gas laser is about equal to the length of the resonator. The length of the
</p>
<p>active medium of a solid state laser is smaller than the resonator length. The length
</p>
<p>of the active medium of a semiconductor laser is about equal to the resonator length.
</p>
<p>Semiconductor lasers have much smaller sizes than other lasers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Helium&ndash;neon laser. The gain is small. Therefore, the V factor has to be close to
</p>
<p>unity&mdash;the reflectivities of the resonator mirrors have to be near unity

<p>2.8 Data of Lasers 37
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.15 Various lasers
</p>
<p>(e.g., R1 = 0.998 and R2 = 0.99). A glass plate covered on the front surface with
</p>
<p>a highly-reflectingmultilayer coating and on the back surface with anantireflecting
</p>
<p>dielectric coating is a high-reflectivity mirror (Sect. 25.7). The front surface with
</p>
<p>its coating acts as resonator mirror while the back surface is outside the resonator.
</p>
<p>The glass tube that contains the laser gas is closed by Brewster windows.
</p>
<p>&bull; CO2 laser. The gain is large. One of the reflectors is a metal mirror; a metal mirror
</p>
<p>has a reflectivity near unity for radiation at wavelengths larger than about 5 &micro;m.
</p>
<p>The output coupling mirror has a reflectivity that is noticeably smaller than unity
</p>
<p>(e.g., R1 = 1; R2 = 0.95). The output coupling mirror is a dielectric plate (e.g.,
</p>
<p>a germanium plate) covered on the resonator side with a dielectric multilayer
</p>
<p>coating and on the other side with a dielectric antireflecting coating; a metal film
</p>
<p>is not suitable as a partial reflector because of a very high absorptivity for radiation
</p>
<p>passing through a metal film (Problem25.18).
</p>
<p>&bull; Neodymium YAG laser (Nd:YAG laser). The gain is large. The length of the active
</p>
<p>medium ismuch smaller than the length of the resonator. Bothmirrors (e.g., R1 &sim; 1
</p>
<p>and R2 = 0.95) consist of dielectric multilayers on glass plates. The Nd:YAG
</p>
<p>crystal surfaces are obliquely oriented relative to the beam axis so that the angle of
</p>
<p>incidence of the radiation is the Brewster angle and radiation traverses the crystal
</p>
<p>surfaces without loss.
</p>
<p>&bull; Titanium&ndash;sapphire laser. The active medium also fills a small portion of the res-
</p>
<p>onator. The gain is large (mirror reflectivities are, e.g., R1 &sim; 1 and R2 &sim; 0.95). The
</p>
<p>titanium&ndash;sapphire crystal surfaces are obliquely oriented relative to the beam axis
</p>
<p>so that the angle of incidence of the radiation is the Brewster angle and radiation
</p>
<p>traverses the crystal surfaces without loss.
</p>
<p>&bull; Fiber laser. The active medium is a doped fiber of small diameter and large length.
</p>
<p>The output power can reach several hundred watt.
</p>
<p>&bull; Bipolar semiconductor laser (SC). The gain can be large already at a small length
</p>
<p>of an active medium. It is possible to use the semiconductor surfaces as reflectors.</p>

<p>38 2 Laser Principle
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.16 Brewster angle
</p>
<p>Then each of the surfaces has the reflectivity R1 = R2 = R = (n &minus; 1)
2/(n + 1)2,
</p>
<p>where n is the refractive index of the semiconductor laser material. The resonator
</p>
<p>material of a GaAs semiconductor laser has the refractive index n = 3.6, and the
</p>
<p>reflectivity has a value (R = 0.32) that is markedly smaller than unity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Quantum cascade laser. The gain is also large at small length of the gain medium.
</p>
<p>Radiation passing at normal incidence through an interface between air and a
</p>
<p>medium experiences loss due to reflection, while radiation of the appropriate polar-
</p>
<p>ization direction passes the interface under the Brewster angle without reflection
</p>
<p>loss. The Brewster angle follows from Snell&rsquo;s law
</p>
<p>sin α2
</p>
<p>sin α1
=
</p>
<p>n1
</p>
<p>n2
, (2.81)
</p>
<p>where α1 is the angle of incidence, α2 the angle of the transmitted beam, n1 (&sim; 1)
</p>
<p>the refractive index of air, and n2 the refractive index of the dielectric material.
</p>
<p>The reflectivity is zero if the electric field vector lies within the plane of incidence
</p>
<p>(p polarization) and if the angle of incidence is equal to the Brewster angle αB
(Fig. 2.16). The Brewster angle is determined by the relation
</p>
<p>tan αB = n2/n1. (2.82)
</p>
<p>The diffracted and the reflected beam (that has no power) are perpendicular to
</p>
<p>each other. Radiation of a polarization perpendicular to the plane of incidence
</p>
<p>(s polarization) is partly reflected and is therefore attenuated by a Brewster win-
</p>
<p>dow. Accordingly, the radiation of a laser that contains Brewster windows is polar-
</p>
<p>ized.
</p>
<p>2.9 Oscillation Onset Time
</p>
<p>The threshold condition does not specify the value of the initial energy density of the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic field.However, there is a physical limit: if there is no electromagnetic
</p>
<p>energy in the resonator, nothing can be amplified.Already one photon in the resonator</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.9 Oscillation Onset Time 39
</p>
<p>can initiate laser oscillation if the threshold condition is fulfilled. One photon in a
</p>
<p>resonator corresponds to a photon density of Z0 = (a1a2L)
&minus;1, where a1a2L is the
</p>
<p>volume of the resonator. After the round trip transit time, the density of the photons
</p>
<p>is V G0 and after s round trip transits, the density of the photons in the resonator is
</p>
<p>Z(s) = Z0(V G0)
s . (2.83)
</p>
<p>To estimate the onset time, we assume that the gain, described by the round trip
</p>
<p>gain factor G0, is turned on at t = 0, then remains constant, and suddenly decreases
</p>
<p>at t = ton to G&infin; (Fig. 2.17, upper part). It follows that the photon density increases
</p>
<p>exponentially from the initial value Z0 until it reaches at t = ton the steady state value
</p>
<p>Z&infin; (= density of photons in the resonator at steady state oscillation). We write
</p>
<p>(V G0)
son = Z&infin;/Z0, (2.84)
</p>
<p>where son is the number of round trip transits necessary to reach the steady state. It
</p>
<p>follows that the oscillation onset time, ton = sonT , is given by
</p>
<p>ton = T
ln(Z&infin;/Z0)
</p>
<p>ln(V G0)
. (2.85)
</p>
<p>Theonset time is proportional to the round trip transit time and to the natural logarithm
</p>
<p>of Z&infin;/Z0. And it is inversely proportional to the natural logarithm of the product
</p>
<p>V G0.
</p>
<p>We replace s by the continuous variable t/T and write
</p>
<p>Z(t) = Z0 (V G0)
t/T . (2.86)

<p>40 2 Laser Principle
</p>
<p>With the identity ax = ex ln a , we obtain
</p>
<p>Z = Z0 e
ln(V G0)t/T . (2.87)
</p>
<p>The number of photons increases exponentially until, at t = ton, a steady state oscil-
</p>
<p>lation is established.
</p>
<p>It follows, for 1&minus; V ≪ 1 and G0 &minus; 1 ≪ 1, that ln(V G0) = ln V + ln G0 =
</p>
<p>(G0 &minus; 1)&minus; (1&minus; V ) =gain minus loss per round trip. Then we can write
</p>
<p>ton =
T
</p>
<p>(G0 &minus; 1)&minus; (1&minus; V )
ln(Z&infin;/Z0). (2.88)
</p>
<p>If the gain is small compared to unity, (G0 &minus; 1) ≪ 1, the oscillation onset time is
</p>
<p>large compared to the round trip time, ton ≫ T .
</p>
<p>Example A helium&ndash;neon laser (length 0.5m; cross-sectional area 1mm2; output
</p>
<p>power 1mW; gain =G &minus; 1 = 0.02; loss 1&minus; V = 0.01) starts with one photon in
</p>
<p>the laser mode (Z0a1a2L = 1) and contains, at steady state oscillation, Z&infin;a1a2L =
</p>
<p>Poutτp = 10
10 photons, where τp = T/(1&minus; V ) = 3.3&times; 10
</p>
<p>&minus;7 s is the photon life-
</p>
<p>time. The density of photons in the resonator at t = 0 is Z0 = (a1a2L)
&minus;1 =
</p>
<p>106 m&minus;3. The density of photons at steady state oscillation is Z&infin; &sim; 10
16 m&minus;3. The
</p>
<p>round trip transit time is T =3.3&times; 10&minus;9 s. It follows that the onset time is ton &sim; 8&micro;s.
</p>
<p>The buildup of steady state oscillation of a helium&ndash;neon laser requires that the radi-
</p>
<p>ation performs about thousand round trip transits through the resonator. The photon
</p>
<p>density (Fig. 2.17, lower part) increases exponentially during the onset time (t &lt; ton)
</p>
<p>and has a constant value for t &gt; ton.

<p>Chapter 3
</p>
<p>Fabry&ndash;Perot Resonator
</p>
<p>The main topics of this chapter concern the characterization of a resonator mirror,
</p>
<p>of the Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometer, and of the Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator.
</p>
<p>In the 1890s, Charles Fabry and Alfred Perot (Marseille, France) introduced the
</p>
<p>Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometer. It consists, in principal, of two partial mirrors that have
</p>
<p>infinitely large lateral extensions. We will determine the transmissivity of a Fabry&ndash;
</p>
<p>Perot interferometer. The transmission curve (Airy curve) exhibits, at high reflectiv-
</p>
<p>ities of the mirrors, narrow resonances with Lorentzian shape.
</p>
<p>A Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator consists of two partial mirrors of finite lateral exten-
</p>
<p>sions. The spectral transmission curve of a Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator is&mdash;for quasiplane
</p>
<p>waves&mdash;the same as that of a Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometer. We will show that the
</p>
<p>transmission curve narrows when a gain medium is inserted into a Fabry&ndash;Perot res-
</p>
<p>onator.
</p>
<p>We mention different types of laser resonators and then discuss properties of a
</p>
<p>Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator. We introduce the ideal mirror and determine the transmission
</p>
<p>curves of the Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometer and of the Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator.
</p>
<p>The Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator, together with the description of radiation as a quasi-
</p>
<p>plane waves, represents a model resonator that is well suited to study basic properties
</p>
<p>of a resonator and of a laser. We will later (Sect. 11.6) show that the Fabry&ndash;Perot
</p>
<p>resonator differs from the Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometer, particularly for radiation that
</p>
<p>propagates at an angle to the resonator axis. There is another very important differ-
</p>
<p>ence: radiation in a Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator experiences diffraction (Sect. 11.8) while
</p>
<p>diffraction plays no role in a Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometer.
</p>
<p>3.1 Laser Resonators and Laser Mirrors
</p>
<p>There are different types of resonators:
</p>
<p>&bull; Resonator with curved mirrors as reflectors (Chap. 11). The resonators are suitable
for most of the gas and solid state lasers as well as for free-electron lasers.

<p>44 3 Fabry&ndash;Perot Resonator
</p>
<p>&bull; Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator (this chapter). It has two plane reflectors. This resonator
represents an ideal model resonator suitable for the study of basic properties of a
</p>
<p>resonator and of a laser. This type of resonator is used in vertical-cavity surface-
</p>
<p>emitting lasers (Sect. 22.7).
</p>
<p>&bull; Waveguide Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator. It has two plane reflectors oriented parallel to
each other. Within the Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator, the light is guided by an optical
</p>
<p>waveguide structure. This type of resonator is used in edge&ndash;emitting semiconduc-
</p>
<p>tor lasers (Sect. 20.5) and fiber lasers (Sect. 15.7).
</p>
<p>&bull; Cavity resonator (Chap. 10). The cavity resonator has metallic walls. It is used as
resonator of semiconductor lasers of the far infrared and of microwave lasers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Photonic crystal resonator (Chap. 25). A reflector of a photonic crystal resonator
can consist of periodically arranged materials of different refractive indices. The
</p>
<p>photonic crystal resonator can be a Fabry&ndash;Perot-like resonator or a cavity-like
</p>
<p>resonator. Photonic crystal resonators are becoming more and more important of
</p>
<p>a variety of lasers, e.g., of microlasers and nanolasers.
</p>
<p>The design of mirrors of a laser resonator depends on the availability of materials of
</p>
<p>mirrors. We mention a few types of mirrors:
</p>
<p>&bull; Ideal mirror (Sect. 3.4). The ideal mirror is lossless; its thickness is infinitely
small; it is able to divide an incident wave in a reflected and a transmitted wave.
</p>
<p>We can choose the reflectivity of this model mirror. We will make use of the model
</p>
<p>mirror to describe main properties of a Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator (this chapter) and
</p>
<p>of resonators with curved mirrors (Chap. 11).
</p>
<p>&bull; Crystal surface. A crystal surface is able to divide, without loss, an optical wave in
a reflected and a transmitted wave. However, the reflectivity at normal incidence
</p>
<p>is much smaller than unity. GaAs crystal surfaces are nevertheless suitable as
</p>
<p>reflectors of semiconductor lasers (Sect. 20.5).
</p>
<p>&bull; Dielectric multilayer mirror (Sect. 25.7). A stack of dielectric quarter-wavelength
layers represents a dielectric multilayer mirror that can be designed as an almost
</p>
<p>lossless reflector with a reflectivity very near to unity (e.g., R = 0.999) for vis-
ible radiation or as a lossless partial reflector with a reflectivity that we can
</p>
<p>choose.
</p>
<p>&bull; Metal mirror. A metal mirror has a relatively low reflectivity and large absorp-
tivity for visible radiation and is not suitable as mirror of a laser that generates
</p>
<p>visible radiation&mdash;a silver mirror shows a reflectivity of 0.95 and an absorptivity
</p>
<p>of 5% for red light. Metal reflectors are in use as reflectors of infrared radiation
</p>
<p>at wavelengths larger than several micrometers. Metal films are not suitable as
</p>
<p>partial reflectors because the absorptivity of a metal film is much larger than the
</p>
<p>transmissivity (see Problems 25.17 and 25.18).
</p>
<p>In Chap. 25, we will discuss various mirrors and methods used for realization of
</p>
<p>feedback and we will describe a method which is suitable to calculate properties of
</p>
<p>multilayer reflectors. In this chapter we treat the Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator.</p>

</p>
<p>3.2 V Factor and Related Quantities
</p>
<p>We first study an empty Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator that has a reflector (reflectivity = 1)
</p>
<p>and a partial reflector (reflectivity R) as described in Sect. 2.4. Radiation starting at
</p>
<p>time t = 0 and performing many round trip transits through a resonator propagates
during the time t over a total distance d = ct . We can write
</p>
<p>Z(d) = Z0 e&minus;d/ lp . (3.1)
</p>
<p>Z is density of photons after propagation over the distance d, Z0 is the photon density
</p>
<p>at d = 0 and
</p>
<p>lp = cτp =
2L
</p>
<p>&minus; ln V
(3.2)
</p>
<p>is the average path length of a photon in the resonator. During its lifetime in the
</p>
<p>resonator, a photon propagates over the distance lp.We introduce the effective number
</p>
<p>seff = lp/2L of round trip transits of a photon. After seff round trip transits, the photon
density decreases to Z0/e. We obtain the relations
</p>
<p>seff =
lp

<p>2L
=

<p>1
</p>
<p>&minus; ln V
=
</p>
<p>τp
</p>
<p>T
. (3.3)
</p>
<p>Besides Z and u, also the total number Za1a2L of photons in the resonator and
</p>
<p>the total energy Za1a2Lhv in the resonator decrease exponentially with the photon
</p>
<p>lifetime τp.
</p>
<p>The quality factor Q (=Q factor =Q value) of a resonator is equal to 2π times the
</p>
<p>ratio of the energy stored in the resonator and the energy loss per oscillation period.
</p>
<p>It follows that the Q factor of a Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator is given by
</p>
<p>Q = 2πl &times;
u &times; a1a2L
</p>
<p>u &times; a1a2Lτ&minus;1p &times; T

<p>&minus; ln V
=
</p>
<p>2πl
</p>
<p>&minus; ln V
= 2πlseff . (3.4)
</p>
<p>The Q factor is equal to the product of the order l of the resonance and the effective
</p>
<p>number of round trip transits of a photon through the resonator, multiplied by 2π .
</p>
<p>We summarize the relations of the V factor and other quantities:
</p>
<p>&bull; τp = T/(&minus; ln V ) = lifetime of a photon in the resonator.
&bull; lp = 2L/(&minus; ln V ) = path length of a photon in the resonator.
&bull; seff = 1/(&minus; ln V ) = number of round trip transits of a photonwithin the resonator.
&bull; Q = 2πl/(&minus; ln V ) = Q factor.
</p>
<p>T is the round trip transit time, L the length of the resonator, and l the order of
</p>
<p>resonance. If V has a value near unity (1&minus; V ≪ 1), the expansion of ln V in a</p>

<p>In the case that the output coupling loss is the main loss and that only a small

relations:
</p>
<p>&bull; V = R.
&bull; τp = T/(&minus; ln R) = T/(1&minus; R) = lifetime of a photon in the resonator.
&bull; lp = 2L/(&minus; ln R) = 2L/(1&minus; R) = path length of a photon in a resonator.
&bull; seff = 1/(&minus; ln R) = 1/(1&minus; R) = number of round trip transits.
&bull; Q = 2πl/(&minus; ln R) = 2πl/(1&minus; R) = Q factor.
</p>
<p>Table 3.1 shows data of lifetimes of photons in different laser resonators. The
</p>
<p>lifetimes differ by several orders of magnitude and correspond to ten to hundred
</p>
<p>round trip transits through a resonators. There is an exception: a semiconductor
</p>
<p>laser is, in principle, able to operate if the surfaces of a semiconductor act as laser
</p>
<p>mirrors. A reflectivity of R = 0.33 of each of the surfaces (of a GaAs semiconductor
crystal) corresponds to a photon lifetime τp = 0.9T/2. The V factor at a single transit
is V1 = 0.33 and the laser threshold condition V1G1 = 1 requires a threshold gain
factor G1 = 3 at a single transit of the photons through the resonator.

<p>3.3 Number of Photons in a Resonator Mode
</p>
<p>The energy of radiation in a mode of a resonator is quantized (Fig. 3.1) and assumes

<p>the values

is equal to the total number of photons in a single-mode resonator. The photon
</p>
<p>occupation number of a mode of a rectangular Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator is Za1a2L ,
</p>
<p>where Z is the average photon density.
</p>
<p>3.4 Ideal Mirror
</p>
<p>We characterize a mirror by the complex reflection coefficient r̃ and the complex
</p>
<p>transmission coefficient t̃ (Fig. 3.2). A plane wave
</p>
<p>Ẽ (i) = A ei(ωt&minus;kz) (3.7)
</p>
<p>incident on a mirror is partly reflected and partly transmitted. The reflected field is
</p>
<p>Ẽ (r) = r̃ A ei(ωt+kz) (3.8)
</p>
<p>and the transmitted field is
</p>
<p>Ẽ (t) = t̃ A ei(ωt&minus;kz). (3.9)
</p>
<p>We introduce an ideal mirror as a mirror of negligible thickness. The reflectivity of
</p>
<p>the mirror is
</p>
<p>R =
|Ẽ (r)|2
</p>
<p>|Ẽ (i)|2
= |r̃ |2 (3.10)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>48 3 Fabry&ndash;Perot Resonator
</p>
<p>and the transmissivity of the mirror is
</p>
<p>Tm =
|Ẽ (t)|2
</p>
<p>|Ẽ (i)|2
= |t̃ |2. (3.11)
</p>
<p>The sum of reflectivity and transmissivity of a lossless mirror is unity, R + Tm = 1.
(We use the subscript m to characterize the mirror transmissivity Tm to avoid a
</p>
<p>confusion with the round trip transit time T .) We can write the reflection coefficient
</p>
<p>in the form r̃ = reiϕ , where r =
&radic;
</p>
<p>R is the amplitude reflection coefficient and ϕ the
</p>
<p>phase between reflected and incident wave. A reflector with the reflectivity R = 1
has a reflectivity coefficient r̃ = eiπ = &minus;1, i.e., the field at z = 0 (location of the
mirror) has opposite direction relative to the incident field. Radiation that is reflected
</p>
<p>from a partial mirror, with a reflectivity smaller than unity and a finite transmissivity,
</p>
<p>shows a phase shift ϕR that differs from π .
</p>
<p>3.5 Fabry&ndash;Perot Interferometer
</p>
<p>A Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometer (Fig. 3.3) consists of two plane parallel partial
</p>
<p>reflectors&mdash;of infinite lateral extensions&mdash;at a distance L . We consider an inter-
</p>
<p>ferometer with two equal mirrors at z = 0 and z = L. Due to multiple reflections
</p>
<p>within the interferometer, a plane wave incident on the interferometer is split into an
</p>
<p>infinite number of plane waves. We treat the case that the propagation direction of
</p>
<p>the radiation is parallel to the interferometer axis. Then, the partial waves transmitted
</p>
<p>by the interferometer add to the transmitted field
</p>
<p>Ẽ (t) = Ẽ1 + Ẽ2 + Ẽ3 + . . . = eikL t̃ t̃

<p>The Active Medium: Energy Levels
</p>
<p>and Lineshape Functions
</p>
<p>We present a characterization of active media with respect to energy levels and line
</p>
<p>broadening.Wemake a distinction between two-level based lasers and energy-ladder
</p>
<p>based lasers.
</p>
<p>In a two-level based laser, stimulated transitions occur between two levels of an
</p>
<p>atomic system. A two-level system of a particular atom or molecule is a subsystem
</p>
<p>of the energy levels of the atom or the molecule. We characterize the two-level based
</p>
<p>lasers as: four-level lasers; three-level lasers; two-level lasers; two-band lasers; and
</p>
<p>quasiband lasers. All presently operating lasers except free-electron lasers can, in
</p>
<p>principle, be described as two-level based lasers.
</p>
<p>In an energy-ladder based laser, stimulated transitions occur between levels of
</p>
<p>energy-ladder systems. The (yet hypothetical) Bloch laser (Chap.32) belongs to this
</p>
<p>type. We will make use (Chap.19) of the concept of an energy-ladder based laser to
</p>
<p>illustrate properties of free-electron lasers.
</p>
<p>Line broadening can be due to homogeneous or inhomogeneous broadening. We
</p>
<p>discuss the Lorentzian and Gaussian lineshape functions. We describe the classical
</p>
<p>oscillator model of an atom and the natural line broadening.
</p>
<p>Finally, we introduce low-dimensional active media. In a low-dimensional
</p>
<p>medium, the freemotionof electrons is spatially restricted.There are two-dimensional
</p>
<p>media, with electrons moving along a plane, or one-dimensional media, with elec-
</p>
<p>trons moving along a line. The strongest restriction occurs in a zero-dimensional
</p>
<p>medium&mdash;all three dimensions are restricted (like in an atom). The classification
</p>
<p>as three-, two-, one-, and zero-dimensional media concerns semiconductor lasers.
</p>
<p>The most important semiconductor lasers&mdash;quantum well lasers&mdash;operate with two-
</p>
<p>dimensional active media.

<p>4.1 Two-Level Based and Energy-Ladder Based Lasers
</p>
<p>A two-level based laser contains two-level atomic systems. Coherent radiation is
</p>
<p>generated by stimulated transitions between the upper and the lower laser levels of
</p>
<p>two-level systems (Fig. 4.1a). Quantities characterizing a two-level system are:
</p>
<p>&bull; E2 =energy of the upper laser level
&bull; E1 =energy of the lower laser level
&bull; E2 &minus; E1 = transition energy
&bull; ν0 = (E2 &minus; E1)/h = transition frequency =atomic resonance frequency
</p>
<p>The laser frequency has a value at or near the transition frequency,
</p>
<p>νL &sim; ν0. (4.1)
</p>
<p>We will characterize the two-level based lasers according to the number of different
</p>
<p>levels involved in transitions in a laser medium (Sects. 4.2 and 4.3). A two-level
</p>
<p>system is a subsystem of the energy level system of an atom or a molecule. All
</p>
<p>presently operating lasers&mdash;except free-electron lasers&mdash;are two-level based lasers.
</p>
<p>An energy-ladder based laser contains energy-ladder systems. A free-electron in
</p>
<p>a spatially periodic field executes oscillations (free-electron oscillations). According
</p>
<p>to an energy level description, an oscillating free-electron forms an energy-ladder
</p>
<p>system and occupies one of the levels of the energy-ladder system. Stimulated emis-
</p>
<p>sion of a photon by the oscillating electron corresponds to a stimulated transition
</p>
<p>between next-near energy levels of the energy-ladder system (Fig. 4.1b). The energy
</p>
<p>levels are equidistant,
</p>
<p>El = l E0, (4.2)
</p>
<p>where l is an integer, Quantities characterizing an energy-ladder system are:
</p>
<p>&bull; E0 =energy distance between next-near levels = transition energy.
&bull; ν0 = E0/h = transition frequency = resonance frequency of the electron oscilla-
tion.</p>

<p>4.1 Two-Level Based and Energy-Ladder Based Lasers 59
</p>
<p>The laser frequency νL of an energy-ladder based laser is slightly smaller than the
</p>
<p>resonance frequency,
</p>
<p>νL &lt; ν0. (4.3)
</p>
<p>We will describe the (yet hypothetical) superlattice Bloch laser (Sect. 32.8) as an
</p>
<p>energy-ladder based laser. We will furthermore show that the free-electron laser can,

<p>4.2 Four-Level, Three-Level, and Two-Level Lasers
</p>
<p>In a four-level laser (Fig. 4.2), a pump excites atoms, molecules, or other atomic
</p>
<p>systems from the ground state level (level 0) to an excited state level (level 3=pump
</p>
<p>level). Relaxation leads to population of the upper laser level (level 2). Stimulated
</p>
<p>emission by 2&rarr; 1 transitions results in a population of the lower laser level (level 1).
Depopulation of the lower level occurs by relaxation to the ground state. We have
</p>
<p>three relaxation processes, namely 3&rarr; 2, then 2&rarr; 1, and 1 &rarr; 0. We assume that
the relaxation 3 &rarr; 2 is very fast. We ignore other relaxation processes (e.g., 2 &rarr;
0). Continuous pumping maintains a permanent population inversion (N2 &gt; N1) if
</p>
<p>the relaxation time τ &lowast;rel of the upper laser level is larger than the relaxation time τrel
of the lower laser level,
</p>
<p>τ &lowast;rel &gt; τrel. (4.4)
</p>
<p>Without stimulated emission, the population of the upper level is equal to the product
</p>
<p>of the pump rate r and the relaxation time τ &lowast;rel,
</p>
<p>N2 = rτ &lowast;rel. (4.5)
</p>
<p>Pumping of a four-level laser medium creates two-level atomic systems; a two-
</p>
<p>level atomic system is either in its ground state (level 1) or in its excited state (level 2).

</p>
<p>The density of two-level atomic systems, N2 + N1, increases with increasing pump
strength. Population inversion in the active medium of a four-level laser medium
</p>
<p>occurs already at the smallest pump rate.
</p>
<p>The maximum efficiency of conversion of a pump quantum (energy E3 &minus; E0) to
a laser light quantum (energy hν) is the quantum efficiency
</p>
<p>ηq =
hν
</p>
<p>E3 &minus; E0
=
</p>
<p>E2 &minus; E1
E3 &minus; E0
</p>
<p>. (4.6)
</p>
<p>The quantum efficiency is very small (ηq ≪ 1) if E2 &minus; E1 ≪ E3 &minus; E0. Then, a large
portion of the pump energy is converted to relaxation energy and therefore to heat
</p>
<p>(or to radiation produced by spontaneous emission). The quantum efficiency is near
</p>
<p>unity if the pump level lies only slightly above the upper laser level and if, at the
</p>
<p>same time, the lower laser level lies only slightly above the ground state level.
</p>
<p>Table 4.1 shows values of relaxation times of upper and lower laser levels of a few
</p>
<p>laser materials. The relaxation times differ by many orders of magnitude. The relax-
</p>
<p>ation 2&rarr; 1 can be due to spontaneous emission of radiation or due to nonradiative
relaxation. Relaxation of the lower level can also be due to spontaneous emission
</p>
<p>of radiation or due to nonradiative relaxation, that is, by a radiationless transition.
</p>
<p>We will specify the relaxation processes later in connection with the discussion of
</p>
<p>specific lasers. The lasers mentioned in the table can operate as continuous wave
</p>
<p>lasers (τ &lowast;rel &gt; τrel).
Optical transitions between two discrete energy levels lead to fluorescence lines
</p>
<p>and absorption lines that have finite linewidths (Sect. 4.4); the notation fluorescence
</p>
<p>is used for photo luminescence (=optically excited luminescence).
</p>
<p>Many laser media have levels with energy distributions. A pump band has, in
</p>
<p>comparison to a single pump level, the advantage that a lamp that emits radiation in
</p>
<p>a broad spectral range can pump a laser. In the case of pumping with another laser,
</p>
<p>radiation of different frequencies is suitable for pumping.
</p>
<p>Examples of four-level lasers: neodymium YAG laser; titanium&ndash;sapphire laser.
</p>
<p>We are dealing with a three-level laser if the pump level coincides with the upper
</p>
<p>laser level (Fig. 4.3a). This type of three-level laser is a special case of the four-level
</p>
<p>laser. For another type of three-level laser (Fig. 4.3b), the lower laser level is identical
</p>
<p>with the ground state level. We denote it as ruby laser type. Population inversion
</p>
<p>requires that more than half of the atoms are in the excited state. Accordingly, the
</p>
<p>transparency density of a ruby laser type is given by</p>

</p>
<p>N0 is the density of impurity ions in a crystal.
</p>
<p>In a two-level laser only two atomic energy levels play a role.
</p>
<p>Example of a two-level laser: the ammonia (NH3) maser [32]. To obtain popula-
</p>
<p>tion inversion, long-lived excitedmolecules are permanently injected into a resonator
</p>
<p>where stimulated emission processes occur. The molecules leave the resonator spa-
</p>
<p>tially. The upper laser level is 35 &micro;eV above the ground state level. Ammonia gas in
</p>
<p>a box contains NH3 molecules in the ground state and in the excited state. A hole in a
</p>
<p>box with NH3 gas at room temperature is the source of a molecular beam consisting
</p>
<p>of excited and nonexcited NH3 molecules. The molecular beam traverses an atomic
</p>
<p>filter that separates the excited molecules and the nonexcited molecules. The atomic
</p>
<p>filter consists of an inhomogeneous field (an electric quadrupole field) that exerts
</p>
<p>forces on the molecules due to their electric dipole moments. The magnitude of the
</p>
<p>dipole moment of a molecule in the excited state differs from that in the ground state.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the forces lead to a spatial separation of the molecules. The excited mole-
</p>
<p>cules pass the resonator and deliver, via stimulated emission, the excitation energy
</p>
<p>to the laser field in the resonator. The ammonia laser was the first microwave maser
</p>
<p>(frequency near 24GHz).
</p>
<p>4.3 Two-Band Laser and Quasiband Laser
</p>
<p>A two-band laser medium has (besides other energy levels or energy bands) a lower
</p>
<p>energy band (band 1) and an upper energy band (band 2), separated by an energy
</p>
<p>gap (Fig. 4.4a). The gap energy is Eg. Without pumping, almost all energy levels
</p>
<p>belonging to the lower band are full and all energy levels of the upper band are
</p>
<p>empty. We suppose that Eg is much larger than kT so that thermal excitation from
</p>
<p>the lower to the upper band can be ignored.
</p>
<p>Pumping&mdash;injection of electrons into the upper band and extraction of electrons
</p>
<p>from the lower band (Fig. 4.4b)&mdash;results in a quasithermal population of energy
</p>
<p>levels in the upper band and in empty levels of the lower band. The electrons in the</p>

<p>upper band undergo fast intraband relaxation. The population in the upper band is
</p>
<p>in a quasithermal equilibrium, which is determined by the lattice temperature of the
</p>
<p>active medium. The populated levels have energies near the minimum of the upper
</p>
<p>band. The width of the energy distribution of populated levels is &sim; kT (or larger at
strong pumping). Energy levels near the energy minimum of the upper band have
</p>
<p>the largest population. The energy distribution of populated levels in the upper band
</p>
<p>is governed by Fermi&rsquo;s statistics.
</p>
<p>The population in the lower band is also in a quasithermal equilibrium, corre-
</p>
<p>sponding to the lattice temperature of the active medium. The empty levels have
</p>
<p>energies near the maximum of the lower band. The width of the energy distribution
</p>
<p>of empty levels is &sim; kT (or larger at strong pumping). Energy levels near the maxi-
mum of the lower band have the lowest population. Fermi&rsquo;s statistics determines the
</p>
<p>energy distribution of populated levels in the lower band too.
</p>
<p>Quasithermal means that the population within an energy band has a thermal
</p>
<p>distribution according to the lattice temperature of the active medium&mdash;but that the
</p>
<p>population of the upper energy band is, relative to the population in the lower energy
</p>
<p>band, far out of equilibrium. Stimulated transitions from occupied levels in the upper
</p>
<p>band to empty levels in the lower band are the source of laser radiation. Establishment
</p>
<p>of a quasiequilibrium in the upper band and establishment of a quasiequilibrium in
</p>
<p>the lower band are due to the interaction of electrons with phonons, that is, due to
</p>
<p>electron&ndash;phonon scattering.
</p>
<p>Table 4.2 shows relaxation times: the intraband relaxation time τintra is much
</p>
<p>smaller than the interband relaxation time τ &lowast;rel. Interband relaxation in an active
medium is mainly due to spontaneous emission of radiation.</p>

<p>The quasiband laser represents a model of a glass fiber laser. The active medium
</p>
<p>(Fig. 4.5a) contains excited-impurity quasiparticles in a quasiband. The quasiband
</p>
<p>lies &sim; 1eV above a vacuum level. The width of a quasiband of an impurity-doped
glass can have a value of 10&ndash;100meV. Optical pumping via transitions from the
</p>
<p>vacuum level to the quasiband creates quasiparticles (Fig. 4.5b). Annihilation of
</p>
<p>quasiparticles via stimulated transitions from the quasiband to the vacuum level is
</p>
<p>the origin of laser radiation. The quasiparticles in the quasiband have a quasithermal
</p>
<p>distribution determined by Fermi&rsquo;s statistics; for relaxation times, see Table 4.2. The

</p>
<p>Fig. 4.6 Homogeneous and inhomogeneous line broadening
</p>
<p>There are many different mechanisms responsible for lineshapes. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>there is a large number of different lineshapes.We divide the lineshapes as lineshapes
</p>
<p>due to homogeneous broadening and lineshapes due to inhomogeneous broadening.
</p>
<p>A homogeneous line broadening occurs if all two-level atomic systems have the
</p>
<p>same lineshape function ghom(ν)= g
(1) = g(2) = . . . = g(N ), where N is the number
</p>
<p>of atomic systems (Fig. 4.6, left). The atomic resonance frequency ν0 is the same for
</p>
<p>all two-level atomic systems.
</p>
<p>In the case that a line is inhomogeneously broadened (Fig. 4.6, right), each two-
</p>
<p>level atomic system of an ensemble has its own resonance frequency. The linewidth
</p>
<p>of the ensemble is larger than the transition linewidth of a single two-level atomic sys-
</p>
<p>tem.We can regard an inhomogeneously broadened line (with the lineshape function
</p>
<p>ginh and the center frequency ν0) as composed of homogeneously broadened lines
</p>
<p>with the frequencies ν0,1, ν0,2, . . ., ν0,N of different two-level systems.

and collision broadened at high pressure.

<p>&bull; Nd:YAG laser. A fluorescence experiment provides the linewidth.
A lower limit of the linewidth of a transition is the natural linewidth. Active media

<p>of lasers operated at room temperature show linewidths of the atomic transitions that
</p>
<p>are always larger than the natural linewidth as a study of the specific lasers shows

<p>(see the chapters beginning with Chap. 14).

<p>4.8 Classical Oscillator Model of an Atom
</p>
<p>An atom consists of a nucleus and an electron cloud (Fig. 4.11a). In the classical
</p>
<p>oscillator model of an atom, the electron cloud is replaced by an electron located
</p>
<p>at the center of the electron cloud, that is, at the position of the nucleus. In equilib-
</p>
<p>rium, the electron does not move. When it is brought out of its equilibrium position
</p>
<p>(Fig. 4.11b), it performs an oscillation with a displacement x(t) and an amplitude
</p>
<p>x0. The oscillation of the electron (charge q = &minus;e) corresponds to an oscillation of</p>

<p>We describe energy relaxation in the classical model of an atom. An atomic dipole
</p>
<p>loses energydue to damping.The amplitude of the oscillation decreases exponentially
</p>
<p>(Fig. 4.13a). The decay time of the amplitude is 2T1 and the decay time of the energy
</p>
<p>content in the oscillator is equal to the energy relaxation time. The linewidth of the
</p>
<p>frequency distribution of radiation emitted by a dipole oscillator is equal to
</p>
<p>∆ω0 =

. (4.34)
</p>
<p>The halfwidth of the frequency distribution of radiation emitted by a dipole is equal
</p>
<p>to the reciprocal of the energy relaxation time.
</p>
<p>We will later study an ensemble of dipole oscillators. The decay of the energy
</p>
<p>contained in an ensemble of dipole oscillators occurs also with the energy relaxation
</p>
<p>time T1.
</p>
<p>[In an ensemble of electrons, the decay of the energy content is joined with the

</p>
<p>4.11 Dephasing
</p>
<p>External forces can have the effect that a dipole oscillator randomly changes the
</p>
<p>phase while the amplitude x0 and the resonance frequency ω0 remain unchanged.
</p>
<p>The average time between two successive changes of the phase is the dephasing time
</p>
<p>T2 (Fig. 4.13b). Radiation emitted by an oscillator consists of a series of subsequent
</p>
<p>wave trains E(t) of constant amplitude A. The average duration of a wave train is
</p>
<p>equal to T2. A Fourier analysis shows that the power spectrum has a Lorentzian
</p>
<p>lineshape. The center frequency is an average frequency, the lineshape function is a
</p>
<p>Lorentz resonance function and the linewidth (halfwidth) is given by

<p>Examples Line broadening due to collisions of atoms and molecules in gases
</p>
<p>(Sect. 14.2); line broadening due to an elastic collision of an ion in a crystal with a
</p>
<p>phonon (Sect. 15.9).
</p>
<p>We will later study an ensemble of dipole oscillators that are prepared in such a
</p>
<p>way that all elementary atomic oscillators are oscillating with the same phase. The
</p>
<p>sum of all atomic dipole moments per unit volume is the dielectric polarization.
</p>
<p>Due to randomly occurring dephasing processes of the atomic dipole oscillators, the
</p>
<p>dielectric polarization decays also with the dephasing time T2. In connection with the
</p>
<p>decay of the polarization, T2 is called phase relaxation time or transverse relaxation
</p>
<p>time (Sect. 9.8).
</p>
<p>Wewill (in Chaps. 19 and 32) find dephasing processes characteristic ofmonopole
</p>
<p>oscillators (next section).
</p>
<p>4.12 Dipole Oscillator and Monopole Oscillator
</p>
<p>A dipole oscillator (Sect. 4.8) consists of a negative charge and a positive charge
</p>
<p>oscillating against each other. Interaction of a dipole oscillator with the surrounding
</p>
<p>can lead to loss of energy and to change of the phase of the oscillation. We are using
</p>
<p>the dipole oscillator as a classical model of a two-level atomic system (Sect. 4.8).
</p>
<p>A monopole oscillator consists of an oscillating single charge. Interaction of the
</p>
<p>charge with the surroundings can change the phase of the oscillation but not the
</p>
<p>amplitude. An electron traversing a spatially periodic magnetic field represents an
</p>
<p>example of a monopole oscillator. An electron crossing a spatially periodic electric
</p>
<p>field is another example.
</p>
<p>The monopole oscillation of an electron propagating at a relativistic velocity
</p>
<p>through a transverse periodic magnetic field is the elementary excitation occurring
</p>
<p>in a free-electron laser (Chap.19); interaction of a high frequency electric field with
</p>
<p>an ensemble of the electron-monopole oscillators leads to gain for the high frequency
</p>
<p>field in the free-electron laser.</p>

<p>74 4 The Active Medium: Energy Levels and Lineshape Functions
</p>
<p>Monopole oscillation of an electron occurs also in the (hypothetical) Bloch laser
</p>
<p>(Chap. 32).An electron in a periodic potential formedby a semiconductor superlattice
</p>
<p>executes, under the action of a static electric field, an oscillation (Bloch oscillation);
</p>
<p>a superlattice consists, in the simplest case, of two different semiconductor layers in
</p>
<p>turn. The Bloch oscillation is the elementary excitation of a Bloch laser.
</p>
<p>A laser based on monopole oscillations as the elementary excitations in an active
</p>
<p>medium can be regarded as an inversionless laser.
</p>
<p>An electron that performs a Bloch oscillation can, alternatively, be described as an
</p>
<p>electron that occupies an energy level of an energy-ladder system. The energy ladder
</p>
<p>consists of equidistant energy levels. In the picture of the energy-ladder system, the
</p>
<p>Bloch laser is a laser with population inversion in the active medium (Sect. 32.7).
</p>
<p>Radiation is generated by stimulated transitions between energy levels of the energy-
</p>
<p>ladder systems.
</p>
<p>It is a questionwhether an electron propagating through a transverse periodicmag-
</p>
<p>netic field can also be characterized by an energy-ladder system. If such a description
</p>
<p>would be possible, a free-electron laser would be describable as a laser with a popu-
</p>
<p>lation inversion, alternatively to the description as an inversionless laser (Chap. 19).
</p>
<p>Interaction of radiation with an active medium based on dipole oscillators leads
</p>
<p>to a gain coefficient that has the shape of a Lorentz resonance curve (see Chap.9).
</p>
<p>Interaction of radiation with a monopole oscillator results in a gain coefficient that
</p>
<p>has the shape of a Lorentz dispersion curve (Chaps. 19 and 32).
</p>
<p>4.13 Three-Dimensional and Low-Dimensional Active
</p>
<p>Media
</p>
<p>We classify media used in lasers as three-dimensional (3D) and low-dimensional
</p>
<p>media. A low-dimensional active medium is either two-dimensional (2D), one-
</p>
<p>dimensional (1D), or zero-dimensional (0D). This classification is useful with respect
</p>
<p>to semiconductor lasers. Semiconductor lasers make use of low-dimensional media.
</p>
<p>Low-dimensional media are realized by means of semiconductor heterostructures.
</p>
<p>The dimensionality concerns solely the question whether electrons move freely
</p>
<p>(between two collisions) in three dimensions, in two dimensions, in one dimension,
</p>
<p>or cannot move freely at all. In this sense, an atom is a 0D system.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.14 gives a survey of active media of different dimensionality:
</p>
<p>&bull; 3D active medium. The electrons move freely in three dimensions. The unit of the
density N of electrons is m&minus;3.
Example electrons in a 3D bipolar semiconductor.

<p>&bull; 2D active medium. The electron motion is bound to a plane. The unit of the two-
dimensional density (area density =sheet density) N 2D of electrons is m&minus;2.

<p>(or molecule or ion) is for itself a quantum system. Boltzmann&rsquo;s statistics governs

<p>the populations of the energy levels in an ensemble of atoms because the interaction

<p>Titanium&ndash;Sapphire Laser
</p>
<p>As an example of a laser, we describe the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser.
</p>
<p>Titanium&ndash;sapphire (=titanium-doped sapphire) has a broad pump band, a long-
</p>
<p>lived upper laser level, and a distribution of short-lived lower laser levels. The broad
</p>
<p>pump band allows for pumping with a lamp or a laser. The broad distribution of
</p>
<p>lower laser levels makes it possible to operate the laser as a tunable continuous wave
</p>
<p>laser or as a femtosecond laser.
</p>
<p>A continuous wave titanium&ndash;sapphire laser is tunable over a large frequency
</p>
<p>range&mdash;extending from the red to the infrared spectral region. A titanium&ndash;sapphire
</p>
<p>femtosecond laser generates ultrashort light pulses with a duration between about 5
</p>
<p>and 100 fs (depending on the special arrangement).
</p>
<p>In a simplified description, we characterize the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser as a four-
</p>
<p>level laser with a broad distribution of pump levels, a sharp upper laser level, a broad
</p>
<p>distribution of lower laser levels, and a sharp ground state level.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we discuss the principle of the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser, andwewill
</p>
<p>give a short description of the design. Additionally, we will present absorption and
</p>
<p>fluorescence spectra of titanium&ndash;sapphire. We will obtain more information about
</p>
<p>the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser in later sections and chapters (particularly in Sect. 7.6,
</p>
<p>Chap. 13, Sect. 15.2, and Chap. 17).
</p>
<p>5.1 Principle of the Titanium&ndash;Sapphire Laser
</p>
<p>A titanium&ndash;sapphire (Ti3+:Al2O3) crystal contains Ti
3+ ions replacing Al3+ ions in
</p>
<p>a sapphire (Al2O3) crystal. The density (number density) of Ti
3+ ions in Al2O3 is
</p>
<p>typically 1&times;1025 m&minus;3, corresponding to a doping concentration of 0.03% by weight
</p>
<p>Ti2O3 in Al2O3.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.1a shows the energy level diagram of a Ti3+ ion in Al2O3. Above the
</p>
<p>ground state level (energy E = 0), there is a continuum of energy levels (the vibronic
</p>
<p>levels of the ground state). Above the lowest excited state level (at E &sim; 2.0eV), there
</p>
<p>is another continuum of energy levels (the vibronic levels of the excited state). The

</p>
<p>lowest excited state level and the vibronic energy levels of the excited state have
</p>
<p>a long lifetime (&sim;3.2 &micro;s) with respect to relaxation to the ground state level or to
</p>
<p>vibronic levels of the ground state; the lifetime ismainly due to spontaneous emission
</p>
<p>of radiation (spontaneous lifetime &sim;3.8 &micro;s). Optical pumping and fast nonradiative
</p>
<p>relaxation lead to population of the lowest excited state level. Laser radiation is
</p>
<p>generated by stimulated transitions to vibronic levels of the ground state&mdash;to levels
</p>
<p>well above the ground state level. The vibronic levels of the ground state then relax
</p>
<p>by nonradiative relaxation processes. Relaxation within the excited state levels and
</p>
<p>within the ground state levels occurs in relaxation times of the order of 10&minus;13 s.
</p>
<p>Absorption processes are mainly due to transitions from the ground state to levels
</p>
<p>that lie, in comparison to the value of kT at room temperature, far above the lowest
</p>
<p>excited state level.
</p>
<p>Wedescribe the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser,which is a vibronic laser, for simplicity, as
</p>
<p>a four-level laser (Fig. 5.1b)&mdash;with a pump level (that has a broad energydistribution),
</p>
<p>a sharp upper laser level, a lower laser level (that has a broad energy distribution too),
</p>
<p>and a sharp ground state level.
</p>
<p>We will discuss vibronic systems in more detail in Sect. 15.2 and Chap. 17.
</p>
<p>All Ti3+ ions in Al2O3 have the same energy level distribution: optically pumped
</p>
<p>titanium&ndash;sapphire is an active medium with a homogeneously broadened 2 &rarr; 1
</p>
<p>fluorescence line (Sect. 17.4).
</p>
<p>The titanium&ndash;sapphire laser operates as a cw laser or as femtosecond laser. The
</p>
<p>laser frequency of a cw laser&mdash;and thus the energy of the lower laser level&mdash;is
</p>
<p>mainly determined by the resonance frequency of the laser resonator, which itself is
</p>
<p>adjustable by the use of appropriate frequency selective elementswithin the resonator.
</p>
<p>In a femtosecond laser, with a broadband resonator, transitions occur at the same time
</p>
<p>into a large number of lower laser levels; in this case, the resonator contains elements
</p>
<p>controlling the phases of the electromagnetic waves of different frequencies that are
</p>
<p>present in the resonator at the same time.</p>

<p>5.2 Design of a Titanium&ndash;Sapphire Laser 79
</p>
<p>5.2 Design of a Titanium&ndash;Sapphire Laser
</p>
<p>Pumping of a titanium&ndash;sapphire laser is possible by use of a discharge lamp or of
</p>
<p>another laser. If a laser is pumped by use of a lamp, light of the lamp is focused on
</p>
<p>the crystal leading to an almost homogeneous excitation of the crystal. Pumping with
</p>
<p>a laser is possible by transverse or longitudinal pumping. In the case of transverse
</p>
<p>pumping, the pump radiation irradiates the titanium&ndash;sapphire crystal from the side.
</p>
<p>In the case of longitudinal pumping (Fig. 5.2), the pump radiation passes a
</p>
<p>dichroitic mirror and is then absorbed in the titanium&ndash;sapphire crystal. The dichroitic
</p>
<p>mirror is transparent for the pump radiation but is a reflector for the laser radiation.
</p>
<p>By inserting into the resonator an element indicated as &ldquo;black box&rdquo; in the figure,
</p>
<p>the laser operates in different ways.
</p>
<p>If the black box is a dispersive element (e.g., a prism or a diffraction grating), the
</p>
<p>laser generates
</p>
<p>&bull; cw radiation; tuning range from about 650&ndash;1200nm on thewavelength scale (250&ndash;
</p>
<p>460THz on the frequency scale).
</p>
<p>If the black box is a mode coupler, the laser generates
</p>
<p>&bull; ultrashort pulses; pulse duration 5&ndash;100 fs.
</p>
<p>Heat produced by nonradiative relaxation processes leaves the titanium&ndash;sapphire
</p>
<p>crystal by heat transfer mainly via the mechanical support of the crystal. Heating
</p>
<p>effects can strongly be reduced if only a small portion of a Ti3+:Al2O3 crystal rod
</p>
<p>is optically pumped. The pump volume is, for example, a cylindrical volume of a
</p>
<p>diameter of 0.5mm in a Ti3+:Al2O3 rod of 1cm diameter. The heat produced in the
</p>
<p>optically pumped region is distributed over the whole crystal. This results in a much
</p>
<p>smaller temperature enhancement than in the case that the crystal is homogeneously
</p>
<p>pumped. Thus, much larger populations of the upper laser level or a much larger
</p>
<p>output power can be obtained. Al2O3 has a large heat conductivity. This favors a fast
</p>
<p>heat escape from the active volume.

<p>5.3 Absorption and Fluorescence Spectra
</p>
<p>of Titanium&ndash;Sapphire
</p>
<p>Spectra of the absorption cross section and fluorescence spectra of Ti3+:Al2O3 are
</p>
<p>known from experimental studies [33]. Figure 5.3 (upper part, left) shows the absorp-
</p>
<p>tion cross section σabs(λ) of a Ti
3+ ion in sapphire. The absorption cross section
</p>
<p>follows from the relation
</p>
<p>αabs(λ) = N0 σabs(λ), (5.1)
</p>
<p>where αabs is the experimental absorption coefficient and N0 the density of Ti
3+ ions.
</p>
<p>The absorption band extends from the blue to the green spectral region. Sapphire is
</p>
<p>an anisotropic crystal. Therefore, the optical properties depend on the orientation
</p>
<p>of the direction of the electric field E of the electromagnetic wave relative to the
</p>
<p>direction of the optic axis (c axis) of the crystal. The absorption lines for E || c (π
</p>
<p>polarization) and E &perp; c (σ polarization) have different strengths but the same shape.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.3 (lower part) shows the fluorescence spectrum. Sλ(λ) is the spectral
</p>
<p>distribution of the fluorescence radiation on the wavelength scale and Sλ,max is the
</p>
<p>maximum of the spectral distribution. The fluorescence spectrum extends from the
</p>
<p>red to the near infrared. The fluorescence lines for E || c and E &perp; c have different
</p>
<p>strengths but the same shape. The large linewidth and especially the long infrared
</p>
<p>tail of the fluorescence band are the basis of the broadband tunability of a titanium&ndash;
</p>
<p>sapphire laser and of the operation as femtosecond laser. The range of laser oscillation
</p>
<p>(dashed in Fig. 5.3) extends far into the range of the infrared tail of the fluorescence
</p>
<p>curve.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.3 Absorption and Fluorescence Spectra of Titanium&ndash;Sapphire 81
</p>
<p>The occurrence of a broad range of laser oscillation is a consequence of the special
</p>
<p>properties of Ti3+ in Al2O3. We will discuss these properties later (in Sect. 15.2).
</p>
<p>We will also show (in Sect. 17.4) that almost all excited Ti3+ ions contribute to
</p>
<p>gain, and that each of the excited Ti3+ ions contributes equally, i.e., all excited Ti3+
</p>
<p>ions contribute equally to generation of radiation in a continuous-wave laser or to
</p>
<p>generation of femtosecond pulses in a femtosecond titanium&ndash;sapphire laser.
</p>
<p>There remains the question: how can we determine, from the fluorescence spec-
</p>
<p>trum, the gain cross section and especially the frequency dependence of the gain
</p>
<p>cross section? This will be discussed in Sect. 7.6. We anticipate the result. Figure
</p>
<p>5.3 (upper part, right) shows the gain cross section σgain of an excited Ti
3+ ion as
</p>
<p>derived from the fluorescence spectrum and by taking into account the spontaneous
</p>
<p>lifetime of an excited Ti3+ ion. The gain cross section has a maximum near 830 nm.
</p>
<p>The maximum value of the gain cross section of excited Ti3+ is about 4 times larger
</p>
<p>than the absorption cross section of Ti3+; a possible reason for the difference will be
</p>
<p>discussed at the end of Sect. 17.2. In comparison to the gain profile, the fluorescence
</p>
<p>curve decreases strongly with wavelength because of the wavelength dependence of
</p>
<p>spontaneous emission.
</p>
<p>5.4 Population of the Upper Laser Level
</p>
<p>Without laser oscillation, the population of the upper laser level (Fig. 5.4) increases
</p>
<p>with increasing pump power P linearly with P at small P (dashed line) and less
</p>
<p>than linearly at large P . The population saturates at very large P , where the N2
population approaches the density N0 of Ti
</p>
<p>3+ ions. The population difference varies
</p>
<p>according to N2 &minus; N1 = K (P/Psat)(1+ P/Psat)
&minus;1, where K is a constant and Psat
</p>
<p>the saturation-pump power. At the saturation pump power the absorption coefficient
</p>
<p>αabs(ν) is half of its value at weak pumping. A population inversion (N2 &gt; N1)
</p>
<p>occurs already at the smallest pump power.

<p>5.5 Heat and Phonons
</p>
<p>Nonradiative relaxation processes in active media produce heat. Therefore, cooling
</p>
<p>of an active medium is necessary. Cooling occurs via heat conduction and heat
</p>
<p>transfer. In solids, phonons play an important role in relaxation processes; phonons
</p>
<p>are quanta of lattice vibrations, i.e., of vibrations of the atoms of a solid. After a
</p>
<p>relaxation process, a phonon decays into heat. Phonons are treated in textbooks on
</p>
<p>solid state physics. As a standard book of heat conduction and heat transfer, see [34].

</p>
<p>Basis of the Theory of the Laser:
</p>
<p>The Einstein Coefficients
</p>
<p>According to Bohr&rsquo;s atomic model (1911), which is based on spectroscopic investi-
</p>
<p>gations, transitions between discrete energyd levels of an atom can lead to emission
</p>
<p>or absorption of radiation of a frequency that fulfills Bohr&rsquo;s energy-frequency rela-
</p>
<p>tion. In an absorption process, a photon is absorbed. In an emission process, a photon
</p>
<p>is emitted. Einstein found that the emission of a photon is possible by two different
</p>
<p>processes, spontaneous and stimulated emission, and that the coefficients describing
</p>
<p>the three processes&mdash;absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission&mdash;are related
</p>
<p>to each other (Einstein relations).
</p>
<p>Making use of Planck&rsquo;s radiation law, we derive the Einstein relations. We also
</p>
<p>show that stimulated emission of radiation is a process that occurs permanently
</p>
<p>around us. There remains the question:what is, in addition to the stimulated emission,
</p>
<p>a specific property of a laser?
</p>
<p>Einstein coefficients can be extracted from results of experimental studies of
</p>
<p>optical properties of matter at thermal equilibrium. In this chapter, we consider an
</p>
<p>ensemble of two-level systems in thermal equilibrium determined by Boltzmann&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>statistics. Later (in Chap. 21), we will treat ensembles that obey Fermi&rsquo;s statistics.
</p>
<p>6.1 Light and Atoms in a Cavity
</p>
<p>How does light interact with a two-level atomic system? We will study this question
</p>
<p>in three steps:
</p>
<p>&bull; We describe the thermal equilibrium between the radiation in a cavity and the
</p>
<p>walls of the cavity.
</p>
<p>&bull; We describe the thermal equilibrium between an ensemble of two-level atomic
</p>
<p>systems in a cavity and the walls of the cavity.
</p>
<p>&bull; We consider a cavity that contains an ensemble of two-level atomic systems and
</p>
<p>radiation.

<p>Fig. 6.1 A cavity and Planckian distribution of radiation
</p>
<p>A cavity (Fig. 6.1, left) contains blackbody radiation. The spectral distribution of
</p>
<p>the energy density ρ(ν) of the radiation depends on the temperature T of the walls
</p>
<p>of the cavity. The spectral energy density is determined by Planck&rsquo;s radiation law

<p>ρ(ν) =
8πν2
</p>
<p>c3
</p>
<p>hν
</p>
<p>ehν/kT &minus; 1
, (6.1)
</p>
<p>where k is Boltzmann&rsquo;s constant. The frequency distribution is shown in Fig. 6.1
</p>
<p>(right). The frequency νmax of themaximumof the distribution is directly proportional
</p>
<p>to the temperature according to the relation
</p>
<p>hνmax &sim; 2.8 kT . (6.2)
</p>
<p>If the walls are at room temperature (T = 300K), the maximum of the distribution
</p>
<p>lies in the infrared (νmax = 1.8&times; 10
13Hz). The spectral density increases as ν2 at
</p>
<p>small frequency (ν ≪ νmax) and decreases as ν
3e&minus;hν/kT at large frequency. Thermal
</p>
<p>equilibrium is established by absorption of radiation by the walls of the cavity and
</p>
<p>by emission of radiation from the walls into the cavity.
</p>
<p>The energy density of radiation in the frequency interval ν, ν + dν is
</p>
<p>u(ν) = ρ(ν) dν. (6.3)
</p>
<p>We now treat a cavity containing an ensemble of two-level atomic systems in thermal
</p>
<p>equilibrium, which is determined by Boltzmann&rsquo;s statistics,
</p>
<p>N2/N1 = e
&minus;(E2&minus;E1)/kT . (6.4)
</p>
<p>The population ratio is near unity if E2 &minus; E1 ≪ kT . It decreases exponentially
</p>
<p>with the energy difference E2 &minus; E1. Thermal equilibrium is established by colli-
</p>
<p>sions of the two-level atomic systems with each other and with the walls of the
</p>
<p>cavity.</p>

<p>6.1 Light and Atoms in a Cavity 87
</p>
<p>Impurity ions in a solid have fixed locations. The populations of the energy levels
</p>
<p>of different ions are in thermal equilibrium with the solid due to absorption and
</p>
<p>emission of phonons. The populations are governed by Boltzmann&rsquo;s statistics.
</p>
<p>Einstein showed [38] that the thermal equilibrium in a gas of atoms can also
</p>
<p>be established by the direct interaction of the radiation with the atoms and that
</p>
<p>three processes of interaction between radiation and atoms must occur: absorption,
</p>
<p>spontaneous emission and stimulated emission.
</p>
<p>Using Bohr&rsquo;s energy-frequency relation,
</p>
<p>hν0 = E2 &minus; E1, (6.5)
</p>
<p>where ν0 is the transition frequency, we can write

</p>
<p>We will now characterize the three processes by the three Einstein coefficients.
</p>
<p>6.2 Spontaneous Emission
</p>
<p>Excited atoms (Fig. 6.2) can emit photons spontaneously, i.e., without external cause.
</p>
<p>The radiation emitted spontaneously is incoherent and the emission occurs into all
</p>
<p>spatial directions. The change dN2 of the population N2 of the upper level, within a
</p>
<p>time interval dt , is proportional to N2 and to dt ,
</p>
<p>dN2 = &minus;A21N2dt. (6.7)
</p>
<p>A21 is the Einstein coefficient of spontaneous emission. The population of the upper
</p>
<p>level decays exponentially,
</p>
<p>N2(t) = N2(0) e
&minus;A21t = N2(0) e

</p>
<p>(=spontaneous lifetime). We have the simple relation
</p>
<p>A21 = 1/τsp. (6.9)
</p>
<p>The Einstein coefficient A21 is equal to the reciprocal of the spontaneous lifetime.
</p>
<p>6.3 Absorption
</p>
<p>Photons of a light field can be absorbed (Fig. 6.3a) by 1 &rarr; 2 transitions. The
</p>
<p>change dN1 of the population N1 of the ground state, within a time interval dt , is
</p>
<p>proportional to the population of the ground state itself, to the spectral energy density
</p>
<p>ρ of the radiation field and to dt ,
</p>
<p>dN1 = &minus;B12ρ(ν0)N1dt. (6.10)
</p>
<p>B12 is the Einstein coefficient of absorption and ρ(ν0) is the spectral energy density
</p>
<p>of radiation at frequencies around ν0. Absorption is only possible in the presence of
</p>
<p>a field&mdash;the absorption is a stimulated process.
</p>
<p>6.4 Stimulated Emission
</p>
<p>Stimulated emission (Fig. 6.3b), by 2&rarr; 1 transitions, is caused (stimulated, induced)
</p>
<p>by a radiation field. The change dN2 of the population of atoms in the excited state,
</p>
<p>within a time interval dt , is proportional to the population N2, to the spectral energy
</p>
<p>density of radiation at frequencies around ν0 and to dt ,
</p>
<p>dN2 = &minus;B21ρ(ν0)N2dt. (6.11)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.4 Stimulated Emission 89
</p>
<p>B21 is the Einstein coefficient of stimulated emission. The radiation created by stim-
</p>
<p>ulated emission has the same frequency, direction, polarization and phase as the
</p>
<p>stimulating radiation.
</p>
<p>6.5 The Einstein Relations
</p>
<p>We are looking for relations between the Einstein coefficients. As discussed, the
</p>
<p>interaction of a two-level atomic system with radiation occurs (Fig. 6.4) via absorp-
</p>
<p>tion, stimulated and spontaneous emission. We describe the three processes by rate
</p>
<p>equations that correspond to differential equations of first order:
</p>
<p>&bull; The rate of change of the population N1 due to absorption is given by
</p>
<p>(dN1/dt)abs = &minus;B12 ρ(ν0) N1; (6.12)
</p>
<p>the temporal change of the population N1 due to absorption is proportional to
</p>
<p>ρ(ν0) and to N1.
</p>
<p>&bull; The rate of change of the population N2 due to stimulated emission is equal to
</p>
<p>(dN2/dt)stim = &minus;B21 ρ(ν0) N2; (6.13)
</p>
<p>the temporal changeof the population N2 due to stimulated emission is proportional
</p>
<p>to ρ(ν0) and to N2.
</p>
<p>&bull; The rate of change of the population N2 due to spontaneous emission is
</p>
<p>(dN2/dt)sp = &minus;A21N2; (6.14)
</p>
<p>the temporal change of the population N2 due to spontaneous emission of radiation
</p>
<p>is proportional to N2.
</p>
<p>We consider a cavity with an ensemble of two-level atomic systems and radiation
</p>
<p>in thermal equilibrium. In the time average, the ratio N2/N1 is a constant. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the absorption rate has to be equal to the emission rate,
</p>
<p>(dN1/dt)abs = (dN2/dt)sp + (dN2/dt)stim. (6.15)

<p>90 6 Basis of the Theory of the Laser: The Einstein Coefficients
</p>
<p>This leads to the relation
</p>
<p>B12ρ(ν0)N1 = A21N2 + B21ρ(ν0)N2. (6.16)
</p>
<p>It follows that
</p>
<p>ρ(ν0) =
A12/B21
</p>
<p>(B12/B21)N1/N2 &minus; 1
. (6.17)
</p>
<p>The Boltzmann factor determines the ratio N1/N2. The comparison with Planck&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>radiation law provides the Einstein relations
</p>
<p>B21 = B12, (6.18)
</p>
<p>A21 =
8πν2
</p>
<p>c3
hνB21. (6.19)
</p>
<p>The frequency ν (replacing ν0) follows fromBohr&rsquo;s relation hν = E2 &minus; E1. We have
</p>
<p>the result:
</p>
<p>&bull; The same Einstein coefficient governs both stimulated emission and absorption.
</p>
<p>&bull; There is a connection between the coefficients of spontaneous and stimulated
</p>
<p>emission.
</p>
<p>&bull; The Einstein coefficient A21 increases strongly with frequency.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.5 shows the spontaneous lifetime for different transition frequencies
</p>
<p>ν = (E2 &minus; E1)/h at a fixed value of B21 (= 10
18m3 J&minus;1 s&minus;2); the spontaneous lifetime
</p>
<p>is of the order of 10&minus;6 s at a transition frequency (5&times;1014Hz) in the visible, 100s at a
</p>
<p>transition frequency (1012Hz) in the far infrared, and 10&minus;15 s at a transition frequency
</p>
<p>(1017Hz) in the X-ray range. Spontaneous lifetimes at X-ray transition frequencies
</p>
<p>are very short. Therefore, operation of an X-ray laser is difficult (Sect. 16.4).

</p>
<p>In the following,wewill treat the case of nondegenerate energy levels (g1 = g2 = 1).
</p>
<p>If two-level atomic systems are embedded in a medium of refractive index n, the
</p>
<p>speed of light in vacuum has to be replaced by the speed of light in the medium. The
</p>
<p>Einstein relations then are

</p>
<p>In this form, the Einstein relations are valid if a medium is optically isotropic. If a

<p>Table 6.1 shows values of Einstein coefficients determined by the use of exper-

<p>Stimulated emission is a permanent process, for instance, in the lecture hall.

</p>
<p>At room temperature, T = 300K, the thermal occupation number has very different
</p>
<p>values in different spectral regions:
</p>
<p>&bull; n̄ ≪ 1 for hν ≫ kT (visible).
</p>
<p>&bull; n̄ &sim; 1 for hν &asymp; kT (infrared).
</p>
<p>&bull; n̄ ≫ 1 for hν ≪ kT (far infrared and microwaves).
</p>
<p>The approximation for small frequencies, n̄ = kT/hν, shows that n̄ increases to
</p>
<p>infinitely large values (n̄ &rarr; &infin;) for ν &rarr; 0). At a frequency ν = 1011Hz, the thermal
</p>
<p>occupation number is large, n̄ &asymp; 100.
</p>
<p>We return to Planck&rsquo;s radiation law and write it in the form
</p>
<p>ρ(ν)dν = D(ν)dν &times; n̄(ν)&times; hν, (6.30)
</p>
<p>where we have the quantities:
</p>
<p>&bull; ρ(ν) = spectral energy density of radiation at the frequency ν.
</p>
<p>&bull; ρ(ν)dν = energy density in the frequency interval ν, ν + dν.
</p>
<p>&bull; D(ν) = 8πν2/c3 =mode density =density of states of photons =density of modes
</p>
<p>per unit of volume and unit of frequency (Sect. 10.4).
</p>
<p>&bull; D(ν)dν = number of modes per unit of volume in the frequency interval ν,
</p>
<p>ν + dν.
</p>
<p>&bull; hν = quantum energy of a photon (=photon energy).
</p>
<p>We can formulate Planck&rsquo;s radiation law as follows: the energy density of blackbody
</p>
<p>radiation is equal to the product of mode density, thermal occupation number, and
</p>
<p>energy of a photon.
</p>
<p>A two-level atomic system (Fig. 6.7a) in equilibrium with thermal radiation can
</p>
<p>emit radiation either by spontaneous emission at an emission rate per excited atomic
</p>
<p>system of τ&minus;1sp = A21 or by stimulated emission at an emission rate per atomic system

</p>
<p>&bull; Mainly due to stimulated emission at small frequencies (hν ≪ kT ).
</p>
<p>&bull; Mainly due to spontaneous emission at large frequencies (hν ≫ kT ).
</p>
<p>Stimulated transitions between energy levels at a transition frequency of 1011 Hz
</p>
<p>occur, at room temperature, almost 100 times faster than spontaneous transitions!
</p>
<p>Not only the walls of a lecture hall but also the persons in the hall permanently emit
</p>
<p>1011-Hz radiation mainly by stimulated emission.
</p>
<p>What is specific about a laser? A thermal system contains radiation with portions
</p>
<p>in all spatial directions. Stimulated emission of radiation propagating in a direction
</p>
<p>compensates absorption of radiation propagating in exactly the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>In a lecture hall, we have permanently stimulated emission due to the interaction of
</p>
<p>the thermal radiation with the persons in the hall and with the walls. The situation
</p>
<p>is completely different in a laser. Pumping of produces an active medium, which is
</p>
<p>in a nonequilibrium state. The active medium experiences feedback from radiation
</p>
<p>stored in the laser resonator and therefore emits, by stimulated emission, radiation
</p>
<p>only in the direction of the stimulating radiation&mdash;i.e., the active medium is able to
</p>
<p>emit radiation in a single mode only.
</p>
<p>6.8 Transition Probabilities
</p>
<p>We express the transition rates by transition probabilities. The transition probability
</p>
<p>for spontaneous emission, i.e., the transition rate per two-level system per second, is
</p>
<p>given by
</p>
<p>w21,sp = A21. (6.32)
</p>
<p>The transition probability for stimulated emission is equal to
</p>
<p>w21,stim = B21,stim ρ(ν0) (6.33)
</p>
<p>and the transition probability for absorption is given by

</p>
<p>an electric dipole transition) by the dipole matrix element

<p>where the spectral energy density of the field that stimulates the transition is given
</p>
<p>on the frequency scale, ρ = ρ(ν). The Einstein coefficient of absorption is
</p>
<p>B12 = B21. (6.38)

</p>
<p>Amplification of Coherent Radiation
</p>
<p>In the preceding chapter, we discussed the interaction of broadband radiation with an
</p>
<p>ensemble of two-level atomic systems. Here, we treat the interaction of monochro-
</p>
<p>matic radiation with an ensemble of two-level atomic systems. We will show that
</p>
<p>the photon density in a disk of light traveling in an active medium increases expo-
</p>
<p>nentially with the traveling path length. The gain coefficient of an active medium is

<p>proportional to the Einstein coefficient of stimulated emission and to the population
</p>

<p>of a two-level system and the population difference.

<p>The largest gain cross section is obtainable for an active medium with a naturally

<p>broadened 2 &rarr; 1 fluorescence line. Then the gain cross section at the line center is
equal to the square of the wavelength of the radiation divided by 2π ; we assume that
</p>
<p>the medium is optically isotropic. The broadening of a transition line of an active
</p>
<p>medium operated at room temperature is always due to another mechanism (and
</p>
<p>not by natural broadening). Therefore, the gain cross section of atoms in an active
</p>
<p>medium at room temperature is smaller than the square of the wavelength of the
</p>
<p>radiation divided by 2π .
</p>
<p>In the case that an active medium is a two-band medium, it is convenient to
</p>
<p>introduce an effective gain coefficient. It is related to the difference of the density of
</p>
<p>electrons in the upper band and the transparency density.
</p>
<p>We compare gain coefficients and gain cross sections of different active media
</p>
<p>and discuss, in particular, the gain coefficient of titanium&ndash;sapphire.
</p>
<p>A two-dimensional active medium can interact with a light beam, which is three
</p>
<p>dimensional, in two ways: it can propagate along the two-dimensional medium or it
</p>
<p>can cross the two-dimensional medium. In the case that radiation propagates along an
</p>
<p>active medium, it is useful to introduce a modal gain coefficient, which is related to the
</p>
<p>average density of atomic two-level systems within a photon mode&mdash;the populations
</p>
<p>of atomic two-level systems still underly the laws governing the two-dimensional
</p>
<p>medium. In the case that radiation crosses an active medium, a description by use of
</p>
<p>the gain factor of radiation (rather than a gain coefficient of the active medium) is
</p>
<p>adequate.

<p>98 7 Amplification of Coherent Radiation
</p>
<p>7.1 Interaction of Monochromatic Radiation
</p>
<p>with an Ensemble of Two-Level Systems
</p>
<p>In a laser, monochromatic radiation acts on an ensemble of two-level atomic systems.
</p>
<p>Which are, in this case, the rate equations?
</p>
<p>We characterize monochromatic radiation (Fig. 7.1) by a spectral energy density
</p>
<p>ρ(ν) that has a constant value within a frequency interval ν, ν + dν and is zero
outside this interval. The energy density u(ν) of the monochromatic radiation is
</p>
<p>u(ν) = ρ(ν)dν. (7.1)
</p>
<p>We assume that the spectral width of the monochromatic radiation is small compared
</p>
<p>to the linewidth Δν0 of the atomic transition,
</p>
<p>dν ≪ Δν0. (7.2)
</p>
<p>If only natural line broadening is present, then dν ≪ Δνnat.
(We treat dν as a small but finite physical quantity; dν appears also as a differential
</p>
<p>in differential equations or integrals. The two aspects&mdash;to consider dν as a finite
</p>
<p>quantity or as a differential&mdash;are compatible with each other, see [20].)
</p>
<p>We ignore, for the moment, spontaneous emission. Stimulated emission processes
</p>
<p>depopulate the upper level and absorption processes populate it. The temporal change
</p>
<p>of the population of the upper level is
</p>
<p>dN2/dt = &minus;B21ρ(ν)g(ν)dνN2 + B12ρ(ν)g(ν)dνN1, (7.3)
</p>
<p>where g(ν)dν is the portion of the transition probability in the interval ν, ν + dν and
g(ν) is the lineshape function.
</p>
<p>Justification: Broadband radiation with a constant spectral density in the frequency
</p>
<p>region of the spectral line leads to the temporal change of population of the upper
</p>
<p>level.

</p>
<p>This is, because of

</p>
<p>gdν = 1, equal to the result of the preceding chapter.
(We assumed that B21 is independent of ν.)
</p>
<p>We continue the discussion of the interaction of monochromatic radiation with
</p>
<p>an ensemble of two-level atomic systems and write, with B12 = B21, the decay rate
in the form
</p>
<p>dN2/dt = &minus;B21ρ(ν)g(ν)dν(N2 &minus; N1). (7.5)
</p>
<p>It follows, with u = u(ν) = ρ(ν)dν, that the temporal change of the population of
the upper level is given by
</p>
<p>dN2/dt = &minus;B21u g(ν)(N2 &minus; N1). (7.6)
</p>
<p>The transitions 2 &rarr; 1 dominate (dN2/dt &lt; 0) if N2 &minus; N1 &gt; 0. The change dN2
of the population N2 is connected with a change du of the energy density of the
</p>
<p>radiation,
</p>
<p>du = &minus; dN2 &times; hν. (7.7)
</p>
<p>Thus, we obtain
</p>
<p>du/dt = hνg(ν)B21(N2 &minus; N1) u. (7.8)
</p>
<p>We replace the energy density u by the photon density, Z = u/hν, and obtain the
temporal change of the population of the upper level
</p>
<p>dN2/dt = &minus; hν g(ν)B21(N2 &minus; N1) Z , (7.9)

<p>dt
= &minus;

</p>
<p>It follows that

<p>dZ/dt = b21(N2 &minus; N1)Z , (7.11)

<p>is the growth rate constant, which is a measure of the strength of stimulated emission.
</p>
<p>The growth rate constant b21(ν) is equal to the product of the photon energy hν, the
</p>
<p>Einstein coefficient of stimulated emission and the value of the lineshape function
</p>
<p>at frequency ν. We have the result: the growth rate (dZ/dt) of the photon density is
</p>
<p>proportional to the population difference and the photon density.
</p>
<p>According to the equation
</p>
<p>dN2/dt = &minus;b21 Z(N2 &minus; N1), (7.13)
</p>
<p>we also can interpret b21 as the decay rate for stimulated decay of the population N2,
</p>
<p>per unit of the photon density and per unit of population difference.
</p>
<p>We replace the population difference by the occupation number difference,
</p>
<p>N2 &minus; N1 = (N2 + N1)( f2 &minus; f1), and write
</p>
<p>dN2/dt = &minus;b21(N1 + N2)( f2 &minus; f1)Z . (7.14)
</p>
<p>The decay rate of the population of the upper laser level is proportional to the den-
</p>
<p>sity N1 + N2 of two-level atomic systems and to the occupation number difference
f2 &minus; f1. The net decay rate of the decay of a single two-level atomic system in an
ensemble of two-level atomic systems is equal to
</p>
<p>r21(ν) = &minus;hνB21g(ν)( f2 &minus; f1)Z . (7.15)
</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can write
</p>
<p>r21(hν) = r21(ν) = &minus;hν B̄21g(hν)( f2 &minus; f1)Z , (7.16)
</p>
<p>where the lineshape function g is now expressed on the energy scale and where
</p>
<p>B̄21 = h B21.
</p>
<p>7.2 Growth and Gain Coefficient
</p>
<p>The temporal change of the photon density is equal to
</p>
<p>dZ/dt = γ Z , (7.17)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>γ = hνB21g(ν)(N2 &minus; N1) = b21(N2 &minus; N1) (7.18)
</p>
<p>is the growth coefficient of an active medium.</p>

<p>If N2 &lt; N1, then α(ν) is negative, and we obtain the absorption coefficient
</p>
<p>αabs = &minus;α = (n/c)hνB21g(ν)(N1 &minus; N2). (7.26)
</p>
<p>In this case, the photon density decreases exponentially according to the Lambert&ndash;
</p>
<p>Beer law
</p>
<p>Z(z) = Z(z0)e&minus;αabs(z&minus;z0). (7.27)
</p>
<p>We continue the discussion of gain. We can replace the population difference by
</p>
<p>the product of the occupation number difference and the density of two-level atomic
</p>
<p>systems, N2 &minus; N1 = ( f2 &minus; f1)(N1 + N2), and obtain
</p>
<p>α(ν) = (n/c)hνB21g(ν) (N1 + N2) ( f2 &minus; f1). (7.28)
</p>
<p>The gain coefficient is proportional to the density of two-level atomic systems and
</p>
<p>to the occupation number difference f2 &minus; f1. We introduce the gain bandwidth Δνg
as the halfwidth of the gain curve α(ν). If B21 is independent of frequency, Δνg is
</p>
<p>determined by the halfwidth of the lineshape function g(ν).
</p>
<p>If the lineshape function is given on the energy scale, then
</p>
<p>α(ν) = α(hν) = (n/c)hν B̄21g(hν) (N1 + N2) ( f2 &minus; f1). (7.29)

</p>
<p>In a light beam propagating through an active medium of length L , the photon
</p>
<p>density increases from the value Z0 to the value
</p>
<p>Z = Z0eα(ν)L . (7.32)
</p>
<p>The single-path gain factor is equal to
</p>
<p>G1(ν) = eα(ν)L . (7.33)</p>

<p>If α(ν)L ≪ 1, then
</p>
<p>G1(ν)&minus; 1 = α(ν)L , (7.35)
</p>
<p>i.e., the single-path gain G1 &minus; 1 is equal to the product of the gain coefficient and
the length of the active medium.
</p>
<p>7.3 Gain Cross Section
</p>
<p>We write the gain coefficient of an active medium (containing two-level atomic
</p>
<p>systems) in the form
</p>
<p>α(ν) = N2σ21 &minus; N1σ12, (7.36)
</p>
<p>where σ21 is the gain cross section of a two-level atomic system and σ12 the absorp-
</p>
<p>tion cross section. The cross sections are equal, σ12 = σ21. It follows that the gain
coefficient of an active medium containing an ensemble of two-level atomic systems
</p>
<p>is given by
</p>
<p>α = (N2 &minus; N1) σ21, (7.37)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>σ21(ν) =
b21
</p>
<p>c/n
=
</p>
<p>hν
</p>
<p>c/n
B21g(ν). (7.38)
</p>
<p>The gain cross section at the frequency ν is proportional to ν, to the Einstein coef-
</p>
<p>ficient of stimulated emission, and to the value of the lineshape function at the
</p>
<p>frequency ν.
</p>
<p>In the case that a line is naturally broadened, we can use the Einstein relations
</p>
<p>and the relation A21 = τ&minus;1sp . We then find
</p>
<p>σ21(ν) =

</p>

</p>
<p>where λ = c/ν0 is the wavelength of the radiation in vacuum, n is the refractive
index of the active medium at the frequency ν0, and ν0 = (E2 &minus; E1)/h. The gain
cross section of a two-level system with a naturally broadened line increases with
</p>
<p>the square of the wavelength (Fig. 7.3, solid line).
</p>
<p>We will see later, when we will discuss specific lasers (Chaps. 14&ndash;16 and chap-
</p>
<p>ters on semiconductor lasers), that the active media of all lasers operated at room
</p>
<p>temperature show 1 &rarr; 2 absorption lines and the 2 &rarr; 1 fluorescence lines that are
not broadened by natural broadening, but that other mechanisms dominate the line
</p>
<p>broadening. Therefore, the gain cross section of radiation propagating in an active
</p>
<p>(isotropic) medium at room temperature is smaller than (λ/n)2/2π .
</p>
<p>If the gain coefficient curve is a Lorentz resonance curve, we can write
</p>
<p>σ21(ν) =
hν

</p>
<p>factor Δνnat/Δν0 smaller than in case of a naturally broadened line.</p>

<p>106 7 Amplification of Coherent Radiation
</p>
<p>The gain bandwidths of the different active media differ by five orders of magnitude.
</p>
<p>The titanium&ndash;sapphire laser has by far the largest gain bandwidth, corresponding to
</p>
<p>30% of the center frequency. The gain cross section (see also Fig. 7.3) differs by nine
</p>
<p>orders of magnitude. The helium&ndash;neon laser and the quantum cascade laser have
</p>
<p>large values of the gain cross section. The bipolar semiconductor lasers have smaller
</p>
<p>values. CO2 lasers and solid state lasers have still smaller values.
</p>
<p>7.4 An Effective Gain Cross Section
</p>
<p>We consider a two-band laser with an active medium containing N0 two-level atomic
</p>
<p>systems per unit volume. Without pumping, all levels in the lower band are occupied
</p>
<p>and all levels of the upper band are empty (Fig. 7.4a); we assume that E2,min &minus;
&minus;E1,max ≫ kT . Pumping leads to a population in the upper band and to empty
levels in the lower band. The population in the upper band and the population in
</p>
<p>the lower band are in a nonequilibrium relative to each other. At weak pumping,
</p>
<p>the population N2 (=N ) in the upper band is small and the density N1 (=N ) of
</p>
<p>empty levels in the lower band is also small. Accordingly, the relative occupation
</p>
<p>number f2 (at energies near the minimum of the upper band) is small ( f2 ≪ 1), the
relative occupation number f1 (at energies near the maximum of the lower band)
</p>
<p>is only slightly smaller than unity and absorption of radiation prevails. The width
</p>
<p>of the energy distributions of each of the populations is of the order of kT . With
</p>
<p>increasing N , f2 increases and f1 decreases until N reaches the transparency density
</p>
<p>Ntr, where f2 &minus; f1 = 0 (Fig. 7.4b). The width of the energy distributions of each
of the populations is still of the order of kT . The largest population in the upper
</p>
<p>band occurs at energies near the band minimum (energy E2,min) and the smallest
</p>
<p>population in the lower band at energies near the band maximum (energy E1,max).

<p>Fig. 7.5 Gain coefficient of a two-band laser medium. a Frequency dependence of the gain coef-
</p>
<p>ficient. b Dependence of the maximum gain coefficient on the population N in the upper band
</p>
<p>If N &gt; Ntr (i.e., f2 &gt; f1), the medium is a gain medium and the gain increases
</p>
<p>with increasing N . The gain bandwidth increases with increasing band filling and
</p>
<p>becomes larger than kT at large filling (Fig. 7.4c); then the widths of the distributions
</p>
<p>are larger than k T .
</p>
<p>The gain coefficient α depends on different parameters: temperature of the active
</p>
<p>medium; Einstein coefficient B21; electron density N ; energy distributions in the
</p>
<p>levels of the lower and the levels in the upper band. The α(ν) curve can have a
</p>
<p>complicated shape (Fig. 7.5a). Gain occurs if the maximum αmax of the α(ν) curve
</p>
<p>becomes (for N = Ntr) positive. With increasing N , αmax increases and the gain
bandwidth increases too. Figure 7.5b (solid line) shows αmax versus N for values of
</p>
<p>N around the transparency density. The expansion of αmax leads to
</p>
<p>αmax = σeff &times; (N &minus; Ntr), (7.44)
</p>
<p>where the differential cross section
</p>
<p>σeff = (&part;αmax/&part;N )N=Ntr (7.45)
</p>
<p>is an effective gain cross section. The effective gain cross section (Fig. 7.5b, dashed)
</p>
<p>corresponds to the slope of αmax(N ) near Ntr. The effective gain cross section is
</p>
<p>the gain cross section related to the density of two-level systems excited in addition
</p>
<p>to the two-level systems that are, at the transparency density, already in the excited
</p>
<p>state. We will discuss later (in Chaps. 21 and 22) how we can determine the effective
</p>
<p>gain cross sections and αmax as well as gain bandwidths of bipolar semiconductor
</p>
<p>lasers; a value of an effective gain cross section is given in Table 7.1.
</p>
<p>We will introduce two other effective gain cross sections in connection with the
</p>
<p>discussion of gain coefficient of a doped fiber (Sect. 18.7).</p>

</p>
<p>7.5 Gain Coefficients
</p>
<p>The gain coefficients of different laser media differ markedly (Table 7.2 and Fig. 7.6&mdash;
</p>
<p>they differ by eight orders of magnitude. The gain coefficient is small for the helium&ndash;
</p>
<p>neon laser, it is large for the CO2 laser and for solid-state lasers. It is very large for the
</p>
<p>(bipolar) semiconductor laser and the quantum cascade laser. The gain coefficient
</p>
<p>of a medium can be obtained by an analysis of the properties of an active medium
</p>
<p>or from the study of the laser thershold. The length L &prime; of an active medium is about
</p>
<p>1 mm or smaller for a semiconductor laser and lies between several centimeters and
</p>
<p>about 1 m for the other lasers. We can ask whether it is possible to increase N2 &minus; N1
in order to obtain larger gain coefficients. The answer is different for the different
</p>
<p>lasers.

<p>7.5 Gain Coefficients 109
</p>
<p>&bull; Helium&ndash;neon laser. The excited neon atoms have a large gain cross section. How-
ever, the population difference N2 &minus; N1 that can be reached is very small.
</p>
<p>&bull; C O2 laser. The value of the population difference given in the table is obtained at a
discharge in a gas of 5 mbar pressure. Higher population differences are obtainable
</p>
<p>at higher gas pressures (e.g., at a gas pressure of 1 bar in pulsed lasers), which
</p>
<p>emit pulses of high power. The gain coefficient α at the line center does not change
</p>
<p>with N2 &minus; N1 because of collision broadening (Sects. 14.2 and 14.8).
&bull; Nd:YAG laser. The population difference N2 &minus; N1 increases in case of stronger
</p>
<p>pumping. However, it is preferable to make use of stronger pumping to increase the
</p>
<p>laser output power rather than to enhance the population difference
</p>
<p>(Chap. 8).
</p>
<p>&bull; Titanium&ndash;sapphire laser. The population difference cannot increase much further,
it has already a value near 10% of the density of Ti3+ ions (at a doping level of
</p>
<p>1025 m&minus;3). A further increase of N2 &minus; N1 leads to saturation of the pump rate
(Sect. 5.4).
</p>
<p>&bull; Fiber laser. An increase of the population difference (at stronger pumping) by
a factor of 10 is possible; the impurity concentration, N0 = 7 &times; 1025 m&minus;3, is by
about an order of magnitude larger than for crystals. The transparency density is
</p>
<p>Ntr &sim; N0/2.
&bull; Bipolar semiconductor laser. An increase of the population difference N &minus; Ntr
</p>
<p>and of α by less than an order of magnitude is possible.
</p>
<p>&bull; Quantum cascade laser. Whether the population difference can be increased
depends on the specific design.
</p>
<p>While the gain coefficient curves of gas lasers follow directly from atomic properties
</p>
<p>of gases and of solid-state laser media from atomic properties of impurity ions in
</p>
<p>solids, the situation is completely different for semiconductor and quantum cascade
</p>
<p>lasers: it is possible to choose the center frequency ν0 of a gain coefficient curve
</p>
<p>through the choice of an appropriate semiconductor material and an appropriate
</p>
<p>heterostructure. Designing bipolar semiconductor lasers is possible for almost all
</p>
<p>frequencies of radiation in the near UV, the visible and the near infrared (150&ndash;
</p>
<p>800 THz). Designing quantum cascade lasers is possible for all frequencies in the
</p>
<p>range 11&ndash;150 THz or, as cooled quantum cascade lasers operating at a temperature
</p>
<p>of 80 K, in the range 1&ndash;5 THz.
</p>
<p>7.6 Gain Coefficient of Titanium&ndash;Sapphire
</p>
<p>In the preceding section, we presented gain data of titanium&ndash;sapphire. Here, we
</p>
<p>show how we can obtain the data. The fluorescence band extends over a large wave-
</p>
<p>length range. Therefore, we have to take into account that the Einstein coefficient of
</p>
<p>spontaneous emission varies strongly with frequency. We now determine the spectral
</p>
<p>distribution Sν(ν) on the frequency scale from the spectral distribution Sλ(λ) on the
</p>
<p>wavelength scale, represented in Fig. 5.3 (Sect. 5.3). We use the relation</p>

<p>where dν is a frequency range near the frequency ν and dλ the corresponding wave-

<p>A21(ν)

</p>
<p>K1 and K2 are constants. Multiplying Sλ (Fig. 5.3) by λ
5 and normalizing the maxi-
</p>
<p>mum of the lineshape function to 1, we obtain the gain profile ḡ(ν) shown in Fig. 7.7
</p>
<p>(solid line). The curve yields the center frequency ν0 (&sim; 360 THz) and the gain band-
width Δνg (&sim;110 THz). The ratio of the gain bandwidth and the center frequency is
about 0.3. The gain coefficient α(ν) has a Gaussian-like profile. At small frequencies
</p>
<p>(ν &lt; ν0), the decrease of the ḡ(ν) curve is less steep than for a Gaussian lineshape
</p>
<p>(dotted). A Gaussian-like gain profile, with a deviation from a Gaussian profile at
</p>
<p>small frequencies, is consistent with the vibronic character of the energy levels as we
</p>
<p>will discuss later (in Chap. 17)&mdash;the deviation is a consequence of the anharmonicity
</p>
<p>of the lattice vibrations of sapphire. We attribute the line broadening to homogeneous

<p>&bull; νc = center frequency of an inhomogeneous broadened line.
&bull; ginh(ν, νc) lineshape function describing the inhomogeneous broadening.
&bull; ν0 = resonance frequency of a specific two-level atomic system; each two-level
</p>
<p>atomic system has its own resonance frequency.
</p>
<p>&bull; ghom(ν, ν0) = lineshape function describing the homogeneous broadening of a
two-level atomic system that has the resonance frequency ν0.
</p>
<p>&bull; dN dν02 = N2ginh(ν0, νc)dν0 = density of two-level atomic systems in the upper
laser level that have the resonance frequency in the frequency interval ν0, ν0 + dν0.
</p>
<p>&bull; dN dν01 = N1ginh(ν0, νc)dν0 = density of two-level atomic systems in the lower
laser level that have the resonance frequency in the frequency interval ν0, ν0 + dν0.

The gain coefficient is α = (n/c)γ . Two-level atomic systems that have different
</p>
<p>resonance frequencies ν0 contribute to the gain coefficient at frequency ν. The Ein-
</p>
<p>stein coefficient B21 can depend on frequency. A special case of (7.52) is the Voigt
</p>
<p>profile (Problem 14.2b).
</p>
<p>7.8 Gain Characteristic of a Two-Dimensional Medium
</p>
<p>There are two possibilities to arrange a two-dimensional active medium in a light
</p>
<p>beam. The propagation direction of the light can be parallel to the plane of the medium
</p>
<p>or perpendicular. We treat here the first case and the second case in the next section.
</p>
<p>We consider the propagation of a parallel light beam that contains a two-
</p>
<p>dimensional active medium (Fig. 7.9). The propagation direction of the light is paral-
</p>
<p>lel to the plane of the medium. We introduce the average density of two-level atomic
</p>
<p>systems in the light beam,
</p>
<p>Nav =
N 2D
</p>
<p>a2
, (7.53)
</p>
<p>where a2 is the extension of the beam perpendicular to the film plane&mdash;the height of
</p>
<p>the photon mode&mdash;and N 2D is the two-dimensional density of two-level systems in
</p>
<p>the two-dimensional medium. If N 2D2 &minus; N 2D1 is the population difference, the average
population difference in the light beam is
</p>
<p>(N2 &minus; N1)av =
N 2D2 &minus; N 2D1
</p>
<p>a2
. (7.54)
</p>
<p>The average density is independent of the thickness of the two-dimensional active
</p>
<p>medium. It follows that the temporal change of the photon density in a disk of light
</p>
<p>is equal to
</p>

<p>Fig. 7.9 Two-dimensional
</p>
<p>medium in a light beam
</p>
<p>Our procedure is justified because it does not matter at which position within the
</p>
<p>photon mode the two-level atomic systems are located. As an essential condition, we
</p>
<p>assumed that the photons in the light beam belong to a single mode.
</p>
<p>The growth coefficient is equal to
</p>
<p>γ = b21
N 2D2 &minus; N 2D1
</p>
<p>a2
. (7.56)
</p>
<p>Taking into account that b21 = (c/n)σ21, we find the gain coefficient
</p>
<p>α = σ21
N 2D2 &minus; N 2D1
</p>
<p>a2
. (7.57)
</p>
<p>The gain coefficient α is inversely proportional to the extension of the photon mode
</p>
<p>perpendicular to the plane of the two-dimensional medium and is called modal
</p>
<p>gain coefficient. The single-path gain factor of radiation transversing a medium of
</p>
<p>length L is
</p>
<p>G1 = eαL . (7.58)
</p>
<p>We introduce the two-dimensional gain characteristic
</p>
<p>H 2D(ν) = σ21(ν)(N 2D2 &minus; N
2D
1 ), (7.59)
</p>
<p>as the product of the gain cross section and the difference of the two-dimensional
</p>
<p>populations. The modal gain coefficient is given by

</p>
<p>The two-dimensional gain characteristic completely describes the active medium
</p>
<p>while the gain coefficient and the growth coefficient depends not only on the proper-
</p>
<p>ties of the active medium but also on the extension of the photon mode perpendicular
</p>
<p>to the plane of the two-dimensional medium. Thus, a modal gain coefficient refers to
</p>
<p>a hypothetical medium: the hypothetical medium has the height of the photon mode;
</p>
<p>it contains a homogeneous distribution of two-level systems; the density of two-level
</p>
<p>systems in the hypothetical medium is equal to the density of two-level systems in
</p>
<p>the two-dimensional medium divided by the height of the photon mode.

<p>In the case that a light beam is crossing a two-dimensional active medium (Fig. 7.10),
</p>
<p>it is convenient to make use of the gain factor rather than the gain coefficient. The
</p>
<p>average population difference in a disk of light is
</p>
<p>(N2 &minus; N1)av =
N 2D2 &minus; N 2D1
</p>
<p>δz
, (7.62)
</p>
<p>where δz is the length of the disk. The change of the photon density within the
</p>
<p>interaction time δt = nδz/c is
</p>
<p>δZ =
N 2D2 &minus; N 2D1
</p>
<p>δz
b21 Z δt. (7.63)
</p>
<p>It follows that
</p>
<p>δZ
</p>
<p>Z
= σ21(N 2D2 &minus; N
</p>
<p>2D
1 ) (7.64)
</p>
<p>and, with G1 &minus; 1 = δZ/Z , that
</p>
<p>G1 &minus; 1 = σ21(N 2D2 &minus; N
2D
1 ) = H
</p>
<p>2D(ν). (7.65)
</p>
<p>The single-path gain G1 &minus; 1 of radiation crossing a two-dimensional medium is
equal to the two-dimensional gain characteristic.

<p>Chapter 8
</p>
<p>A Laser Theory
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we present simple laser equations describing the dynamics of laser
</p>
<p>oscillation. The equations are coupled rate equations relating the populations of the
</p>
<p>laser levels and the photon density.
</p>
<p>The laser equations provide the threshold condition, the pump threshold, and
</p>
<p>the threshold population difference. The solutions to the equations indicate that, at
</p>
<p>steady state oscillation, clamping of the population difference occurs. Pumping with
</p>
<p>a pump power exceeding the pump threshold results in generation of laser radiation.
</p>
<p>The analysis of the laser equations allows us, furthermore, to determine the oscillation
</p>
<p>onset time and to calculate the optimum output coupling efficiency of a laser.
</p>
<p>During the onset of laser oscillation, the interplay of the active medium with the
</p>
<p>field in a laser resonator can lead to oscillations (relaxation oscillations) of both
</p>
<p>the density of photon in the resonator and the population difference. We derive
</p>
<p>a criterion of the occurrence of relaxation oscillations. The relaxation oscillations
</p>
<p>have frequencies in the GHz range.
</p>
<p>We perform an estimate of the laser linewidth. It is finite because of the influ-
</p>
<p>ence of noise on laser oscillation. Amplification of radiation, which is either due to
</p>
<p>spontaneous emission by the active medium or due to thermal radiation in the laser
</p>
<p>resonator is the origin of the finite linewidth of laser radiation.
</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will extend the theory taking into account that laser oscil-
</p>
<p>lation is joined with a high frequency polarization of the active medium.
</p>
<p>8.1 Rate Equations
</p>
<p>To describe dynamical processes occurring in a laser, we make use of a rate equation
</p>
<p>theory; the rate equations correspond to differential equations of first order. We treat
</p>
<p>the four-level laser. The theory applies, without modification, also to the three-level
</p>
<p>laser (with the pump level coinciding with the upper laser level).
</p>
<p>In the center of the four-level laser (Fig. 8.1) is a two-level atomic system with
</p>
<p>the upper laser level 2 and the lower laser level 1. An ensemble of two-level atomic

</p>
<p>systems interacts with the laser radiation by stimulated emission and absorption of
</p>
<p>radiation. The upper laser level can relax (relaxation time τ &lowast;rel) by transitions to the
</p>
<p>lower laser level. Pumping into the pump level (level 3) and fast relaxation leads to
</p>
<p>a population of the upper laser level. The population rate r is a measure of the pump
</p>
<p>strength. The lower laser level is depopulated by relaxation (relaxation time τrel). We
</p>
<p>assume that further processes, like the relaxation 3 &rarr; 1 or 2 &rarr; 0, are negligibly
week.
</p>
<p>We describe the dynamics of the four-level laser by the laser rate equations:
</p>
<p>dN2
</p>
<p>dt
= r &minus;
</p>
<p>N2
</p>
<p>τ &lowast;rel
&minus; b21 Z(N2 &minus; N1), (8.1)

+ b21 Z(N2 &minus; N1), (8.2)

<p>dZ
</p>
<p>dt
= b21 Z(N2 &minus; N1)&minus;
</p>
<p>Z
</p>
<p>τp
. (8.3)
</p>
<p>These laser equations take into account the following processes:
</p>
<p>&bull; The upper laser level is populated by pumping with the pump rate r . It is depopu-
lated by relaxation with the relaxation rate N2/τ
</p>
<p>&lowast;
rel and by the net effect of stimu-
</p>
<p>lated emission and absorption with the rate b21 Z(N2 &minus; N1).
&bull; The lower laser level is depopulated by relaxation to the ground state with the rate
</p>
<p>N1/τrel. It is populated by the relaxation of the upper laser level and the net effect
</p>
<p>of stimulated emission and absorption.
</p>
<p>&bull; The photon density increases according to the net effect of stimulated 2 &rarr; 1
transitions and absorption processes and decreases due to loss of photons in the
</p>
<p>resonator.
</p>
<p>The three equations are nonlinear differential equations relating N1, N2, and Z . We
</p>
<p>list the quantities used for description of the four-level laser:
</p>
<p>&bull; N2 = population of the upper laser level = density of two-level atomic systems
in the upper laser level = number density (=number per m3) of two-level atomic
systems in the upper laser level.
</p>
<p>&bull; N1 = population of the lower laser level = density of two-level atomic systems
in the lower laser level.
</p>
<p>&bull; N2 &minus; N1 = population difference.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.1 Rate Equations 121
</p>
<p>&bull; N1 + N2 = density of two-level atomic systems.
&bull; τ &lowast;rel = lifetime of the upper laser level with respect to 2 &rarr; 1 relaxation.
&bull; τrel = lifetime of the lower laser level with respect to 1 &rarr; 0 relaxation.
&bull; r = pump rate (per unit volume) = number of two-level atomic systems in the
</p>
<p>upper laser level that are excited per m3 and s.
</p>
<p>&bull; E21 = E2 &minus; E1 = energy difference of the laser levels = transition energy.
&bull; ν = frequency of the laser radiation.
</p>
<p>Because of line broadening effects, the quantum energy hν of a laser photon is not
</p>
<p>necessarily equal to the transition energy E21. We are describing a laser that oscillates
</p>
<p>on one mode. We characterize the light in the laser resonator by the quantities:
</p>
<p>&bull; Z = photon density (=number of photons per m3).
&bull; τp = photon lifetime = average lifetime of a photon in the resonator.
&bull; κ = κi + κout (=1/τp) = photon loss coefficient of the resonator.
&bull; κi = internal loss coefficient describing loss of photons within the resonator.
&bull; κout = loss coefficient describing loss of photons by output coupling of radiation.
&bull; b21(ν) = hνB21g(ν) = growth rate constant.
&bull; σ21 = nb21/c = gain cross section.
&bull; n = refractive index of the active medium at the laser frequency.
&bull; c = speed of light in vacuum.
</p>
<p>8.2 Steady State Oscillation of a Laser
</p>
<p>At steady state oscillation, the populations and the photon density are independent
</p>
<p>of time,
</p>
<p>dN2/dt = 0; dN1/dt = 0; dZ/dt = 0. (8.4)
</p>
<p>We obtain the three laser equations
</p>
<p>r &minus; N2/τ &lowast;rel &minus; b21 Z(N2 &minus; N1) = 0, (8.5)
&minus;N1/τrel + N2/τ &lowast;rel + b21 Z(N2 &minus; N1) = 0, (8.6)
</p>
<p>b21 Z(N2 &minus; N1)&minus; Z/τp = 0. (8.7)
</p>
<p>(In the case that the laser levels are degenerate, we have to replace N2 &minus; N1 by N2 &minus;
N1g2/g1. Population inversion then corresponds to the condition N2 &gt; N1g2/g1;
</p>
<p>g1 = degree of degeneracy of level 1 and g2 = degree of degeneracy of level 2. In
the following, we treat an ensemble of two-level atomic systems, g1 = g2 = 1.)
</p>
<p>At steady state oscillation, the photon density is unequal to zero (Z �= 0) and we
can eliminate Z from the first two equations and find
</p>
<p>N1,&infin;/τrel = r. (8.8)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>122 8 A Laser Theory
</p>
<p>The relaxation rate of the lower laser level is equal to the pump rate. This result is
</p>
<p>obvious (see Fig. 8.1): at steady state, the pumping compensates the loss of two-level
</p>
<p>atomic systems.
</p>
<p>Equation (8.7) yields the threshold condition:
</p>
<p>(N2 &minus; N1)th = (N2 &minus; N1)&infin; =
1
</p>
<p>b21τp
=
</p>
<p>κi + κout
hνB21g(ν)
</p>
<p>. (8.9)
</p>
<p>(N2 &minus; N1)th is the threshold population difference. The population difference at
steady state oscillation is equal to the threshold population difference,
</p>
<p>(N2 &minus; N1)&infin; = (N2 &minus; N1)th. (8.10)
</p>
<p>The population difference is independent of the pump rate and is &ldquo;clamped&rdquo; to the
</p>
<p>threshold population difference (N2 &minus; N1)th. The population difference is equal to
the reciprocal of the product of the growth rate constant and the lifetime of a photon
</p>
<p>in the resonator. The threshold decreases with increasing growth rate constant and
</p>
<p>with increasing photon lifetime. The threshold condition is also discussed in the next
</p>
<p>section.
</p>
<p>We find, with
</p>
<p>(N2 &minus; N1)&infin; = (N2,&infin; &minus; N1,&infin;), (8.11)
</p>
<p>that
</p>
<p>N2,&infin; = N1.&infin; +
1
</p>
<p>b21τp
. (8.12)
</p>
<p>Both N2,&infin; and N1,&infin; increase linearly with the pump rate while the difference expe-
</p>
<p>riences clamping.
</p>
<p>It follows from (8.5) and (8.6) that the photon density is given by
</p>
<p>Z&infin; = r
(
</p>
<p>1 &minus;
τrel
</p>
<p>τ &lowast;rel
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>τp &minus;
(N2 &minus; N1)&infin;τp
</p>
<p>τ &lowast;rel
. (8.13)
</p>
<p>The photon density at steady state oscillation increases linearly with the pump rate

<p>We will express the threshold condition in different ways. All formulations are

<p>equivalent.
</p>
<p>The condition of steady state oscillation is the following: the rate of photon pro-
</p>
<p>duction is equal to the rate of photon loss:

<p>b21(N2 &minus; N1)&infin;Z&infin; =
Z&infin;

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>124 8 A Laser Theory
</p>
<p>On the left side, we have the time it takes, in the time average, to produce one
</p>
<p>photon and on the right side, we have the average lifetime of a photon in the laser
</p>
<p>resonator. We can interpret the steady state: during its lifetime in the resonator,
</p>
<p>a photon reproduces itself by a stimulated emission process exactly once.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can write
</p>
<p>(N2 &minus; N1)&infin; =
1
</p>
<p>cτpσ21
=
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>lpσ21
. (8.21)
</p>
<p>The threshold population difference is inversely proportional to the product of the
</p>
<p>path length lp of a photon in the resonator and of the gain cross section σ21. We can
</p>
<p>also write
</p>
<p>(N2 &minus; N1)&infin;σ21lp = 1. (8.22)
</p>
<p>This means: On its multiple path through the resonator, a photon induces exactly
</p>
<p>one photon by a stimulated emission process. Or, on its multiple path through the
</p>
<p>resonator, a photon reproduces itself before it leaves the resonator. Finally, we write
</p>
<p>(N2 &minus; N1)&infin; =
1
</p>
<p>σ21lp
. (8.23)
</p>
<p>By replacing the photon path length lp = 2nL/(&minus; ln V ), we obtain the threshold
population difference
</p>
<p>(N2 &minus; N1)&infin; =
&minus; ln V
2nLσ21
</p>
<p>. (8.24)
</p>
<p>The threshold population difference tends to zero if the V factor approaches unity.
</p>
<p>8.4 Onset of Laser Oscillation
</p>
<p>We assume that we suddenly, at time t = 0, turn on a population difference (N2 &minus;
N1)0. The temporal change of the photon density Z in the laser resonator is, for
</p>
<p>small Z , given by the equation
</p>
<p>1
</p>

<p>dZ
</p>
<p>dt
= b21(N2 &minus; N1)0 &minus;
</p>

</p>
<p>τp
. (8.25)
</p>
<p>The solution is
</p>
<p>Z(t) = Z0 e(γ0&minus;κ)t . (8.26)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.4 Onset of Laser Oscillation 125
</p>
<p>Z0 is the photon density at t = 0,
</p>
<p>γ0 = b21(N2 &minus; N1)0 (8.27)
</p>
<p>is the small-signal growth coefficient, and κ = 1/τp is the decay coefficient of the
resonator with respect to the decay of a photon.
</p>
<p>To estimate the onset time ton, we now assume that the population difference
</p>
<p>remains constant during the buildup of laser oscillation and changes suddenly to the
</p>
<p>steady state value (N2&minus;N1)&infin;. Under this assumption, the density Z of photons in the
resonator increases exponentially until it reaches the steady value Z&infin;. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>we find
</p>
<p>Z&infin; = Z0 e(γ0&minus;κ)ton . (8.28)
</p>
<p>It follows that the oscillation onset time is equal to
</p>
<p>ton =
ln(Z&infin;/Z0)
</p>
<p>γ0 &minus; κ
. (8.29)
</p>
<p>This is the same result as derived earlier (in Sect. 2.9) since the gain factor is G0 =
eγ0T and the V factor is V = e&minus;κT , where T is the round trip transit time; see (2.85).
</p>
<p>According to our description of the buildup of laser oscillation, the photon density
</p>
<p>increases exponentially (Fig. 8.3) until it reaches, at the onset time ton, the steady state
</p>
<p>value Z&infin;. The population density decreases at the onset time ton from (N2 &minus; N1)0 to

and the photon density Z are smoothly going over into their steady state values
</p>
<p>(dashed curves in Fig. 8.3).
</p>
<p>In our discussion of the onset of laser oscillation, we assume that the relaxation
</p>
<p>time of the upper laser level is much smaller than the onset time, τ &lowast;rel ≪ ton. In this
case, the population N2 reaches a constant value at t = 0, immediately after the
start of the pumping, as indicated in Fig. 8.3. Together with the population N2, the
</p>
<p>population N1 reaches a constant value immediately after the start of pumping too.
</p>
<p>The helium&ndash;neon laser belongs to the lasers that fulfill the condition of a fast
</p>
<p>relaxation in comparison with the oscillation onset time. The relaxation time τ &lowast;rel of
</p>
<p>many other laser media (for instance, of titanium&ndash;sapphire) is much larger than the
</p>
<p>oscillation onset time. Then the population and the photon density show dynamic
</p>
<p>effects, which we will discuss later (Sects. 8.8 and 9.8).
</p>
<p>8.5 Clamping of Population Difference
</p>
<p>The population difference at steady state oscillation is clamped to the threshold
</p>
<p>population difference. What does this mean with respect to the occupation number
</p>
<p>difference f2 &minus; f1? It follows from the laser equations of the steady state that the
density of two-level atomic systems increases with increasing pump rate according to
</p>
<p>(N1 + N2)&infin; =
1
</p>
<p>b21τp
+ 2rτrel. (8.30)
</p>
<p>Both N1,&infin; and N2,&infin; increase,
</p>
<p>N1,&infin; = rτrel, (8.31)
</p>
<p>N2,&infin; =
1
</p>
<p>b21τp
+ rτrel. (8.32)
</p>
<p>The occupation number difference is given by
</p>
<p>( f2 &minus; f1)&infin; =
(N2 &minus; N1)&infin;
(N2 + N1)&infin;
</p>
<p>=
1
</p>
<p>(N2 + N1)&infin;
&times;
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>b21τp
. (8.33)
</p>
<p>The solid lines of Fig. 8.4 illustrate our result concerning a laser oscillating above
</p>
<p>threshold. With increasing pump rate, the density N2 + N1 of two-level atomic
systems increases and the population difference (N2 &minus; N1)&infin; remains constant while
the occupation number difference f2&minus; f1 decreases; below threshold, the populations
N2 and N1 as well as f2 &minus; f1 increase linearly with the pump rate (dashed lines). In a
four-level laser, the occupation number difference f2 &minus; f1 decreases with increasing
pump rate. An increaasing pump rate corresponds to an increasing density of two-
</p>
<p>level systems in the active medium.</p>

</p>
<p>laser
</p>
<p>If the lifetime of the lower laser level is very small, τrel ≪ τ &lowast;rel, the two-level atomic
systems are mainly in their excited states because the population of level 1 is small
</p>
<p>compared to the population of level 2 (N1 ≪ N2). Then the population difference
is nearly equal to the density of the two-level atomic systems, N2 &minus; N1 &asymp; N2 + N1.
Accordingly, the occupation number difference is near unity, ( f2 &minus; f1)&infin; &sim; 1.
</p>
<p>We will later find (Chaps. 21 and 22) that for a two-band laser, clamping occurs for
</p>
<p>the occupation number difference f2 &minus; f1. The reason is that the density of twolevel
systems in a two-band medium is constant and does not depend on the pump strength.
</p>
<p>8.6 Optimum Output Coupling
</p>
<p>How can we obtain optimum laser output? We have two limiting cases:
</p>
<p>&bull; If we choose an output coupling mirror of reflectivity R = 1, a strong laser field
builds up. The laser, however, does not emit radiation.
</p>
<p>&bull; If we choose an output coupling mirror of a reflectivity allowing laser oscillation
to occur just at threshold, then the laser field in the resonator is extremely weak.
</p>
<p>The output power of the laser is negligibly small too.
</p>
<p>Optimum output corresponds to an intermediate case. We can choose the reflectivity
</p>
<p>of the output coupling mirror of a laser and thus the output coupling coefficient κout
(Fig. 8.5a). We are now looking for the value of κout that leads to optimum output; we
</p>
<p>assume that τrel ≪ τ &lowast;rel. We introduce the photon output coupling rate rout. At steady
state, the output coupling rate (=number of photons coupled out from the resonator
per m3 and per s) is
</p>
<p>rout = κout Z&infin; =
κout
</p>
<p>κi + κout
(r &minus; rth). (8.34)</p>

<p>Fig. 8.5 Output coupling of radiation. a Output coupling coefficient. b Output coupling efficiency
</p>

</p>
<p>The output coupling rate is proportional to the difference of pump rate and threshold
</p>
<p>pump rate. We can write
</p>
<p>rout = Z&infin;κout =
rκout

</p>
<p>We define the output coupling efficiency by
</p>
<p>ηout = rout/r, (8.36)
</p>
<p>where r is the pump rate. A straightforward calculation yields
</p>
<p>ηout =
1

<p>(K &minus; 1)κout/κi &minus; κ2out/κ2i

</p>
<p>where the parameter
</p>
<p>K = r/rth,i (8.38)
</p>
<p>is a measure of the pump rate. By differentiating ηout with respect to κout and equating
</p>
<p>to zero, we find that optimum output coupling occurs if
</p>
<p>(κout/κi)opt =

<p>The output coupling efficiency depends on the pump rate parameter K (Fig. 8.5b).

<p>K ≫ 1, the optimum efficiency ηout
approaches unity. In this case, the pump power is converted into energy of relaxation
</p>
<p>and energy of photons in the laser mode; almost all photons are coupled out. The
</p>
<p>intrinsic loss of photons (e.g., due to diffraction or due to absorption of radiation
</p>
<p>within the laser resonator) becomes negligibly small.
</p>
<p>Which is the density Z&infin; of photons in the laser resonator? Using the relation
</p>
<p>κout Z&infin; = rout = ηoutr, (8.41)

atomic system and where Z&lowast;&infin; is the photon density in units of this quantity.
</p>
<p>Figure 8.7 shows, for K = 10, the output coupling efficiency and the density of
photons in the laser resonator. At optimum output coupling, the number of photons
</p>
<p>in the resonator is by far smaller than at weak output coupling. The analysis shows
</p>
<p>that optimum output coupling corresponds to a compromise between a high density
</p>
<p>of photons in the resonator and a large output coupling efficiency.</p>

<p>8.7 Two Laser Rate Equations
</p>
<p>We will replace equations (8.1) and (8.2) by one equation. By subtracting (8.2) from
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>dt
(N2 + N1) = r &minus;
</p>
<p>N1
</p>
<p>τrel
= 0. (8.44)
</p>
<p>Addition of (8.43) and (8.44) leads to the differential equation
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
(N2 &minus; N1) = 2r &minus;
</p>
<p>2(N2 &minus; N1)
τ &lowast;rel
</p>
<p>&minus; 2b21 Z(N2 &minus; N1). (8.45)
</p>
<p>We investigate the case that the population difference is suddenly turned on. At
</p>
<p>t = 0, immediately after the production of the population inversion, the photon
density Z is negligibly small. It follows that
</p>
<p>(N2 &minus; N1)0 = rτ &lowast;rel. (8.46)
</p>
<p>The population difference (N2 &minus; N1)0 at time t = 0 is equal to the pump rate
multiplied by the lifetime of the upper laser level. By replacing r , we obtain (instead
</p>
<p>of originally three equations) two laser rate equations:
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
(N2 &minus; N1) =

</p>
<p>At steady state, d(N2 &minus; N1)/dt = 0, the population difference is given by

We relate the initial population, the population at steady state and the photon
</p>
<p>density at steady state. We assume again that τrel ≪ τ &lowast;rel. We find, from (8.9), (8.15)

</p>
<p>Now, the questions remain how N2 &minus; N1 develops in the time region t &asymp; ton from
the initial value (N2&minus;N1)0 to (N2&minus;N1)&infin; and how the photon density changes from
the exponential increase at t ≪ ton to the constant value Z&infin;. To study the transition
from the initial to the steady state, it is necessary to know more about the role of the
</p>
<p>active medium. This question is a topic of the next chapter.
</p>
<p>We obtain a connection to the next chapter by considering the energy content
</p>
<p>of a laser. A laser contains three forms of energy: energy of excitation of two-level
</p>
<p>atomic systems uex = (N2 &minus; N1)&infin;(E2 &minus; E1) = hν/cσ21τp; electromagnetic field
energy u = ε0 A2&infin;/4; and polarization energy of density upol. A goal of the discussion
presented in Chap. 9 will be to find out the relations between the three forms of energy

<p>during the buildup of laser oscillation as well as at steady state&mdash;we will find that,

<p>at steady state, the polarization energy density is equal to the field energy density.

<p>A relaxation oscillation can occur during the buildup of a laser oscillation. We
</p>
<p>search for an oscillation of the population difference and of the photon density at

<p>time t = ton. We use the ansatz

<p>A helium&ndash;neon laser fulfills the condition τp &ge; τ &lowast;rel; it shows no relaxation oscil-

<p>the laser linewidth, we make use of results with respect of a Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator
</p>
<p>containing an active medium (Sect. 3.7). The power P of radiation emitted by a

<p>Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator (containing an active medium) at a frequency ν in the vicinity

<p>Driving a Laser Oscillation
</p>
<p>We investigate the role of electric polarization of a laser medium in order to obtain
</p>
<p>further insight into dynamical processes occurring in a laser. The reader, who does
</p>
<p>not wish to interrupt the description of a laser and its operation, may skip over this
</p>
<p>chapter.
</p>
<p>We study interaction of a medium with a high frequency field by use of Maxwell&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>equations. We derive five coupled differential equations of second order. Applying
</p>
<p>the slowly varying amplitude approximation, we can reduce the equations to five
</p>
<p>nonlinear differential equations of first order. The equations relate: population dif-
</p>
<p>ference; amplitude of the field; phase of the field; amplitude of the polarization; and
</p>
<p>phase of the polarization.
</p>
<p>We can reduce the five differential equations to three in the case that transverse
</p>
<p>relaxation of the polarization is absent and that the three relevant frequencies&mdash;
</p>
<p>laser frequency, atomic transition frequency, and resonance frequency of the laser
</p>
<p>resonator&mdash;coincide with each other. The three equations relate population differ-
</p>
<p>ence, amplitude of the field, and amplitude of the polarization. The solutions yield the
</p>
<p>temporal development of population difference, amplitude of the field, and amplitude
</p>
<p>of the polarization during onset of laser oscillation.
</p>
<p>We finally derive, in the slowly varying amplitude approximation, the laser equa-
</p>
<p>tions in the case that transverse relaxation is present and that the laser frequency is
</p>
<p>equal to the resonance frequency of the resonator but differs from the atomic transi-
</p>
<p>tion frequency. We obtain five nonlinear coupled differential equations of first order
</p>
<p>(Lorenz&ndash;Haken equations).

<p>This chapter begins with an introduction of the electric polarization of a medium.
</p>
<p>We make use of the classical oscillator model of an atom. We derive a classical expres-
</p>
<p>sion of the dielectric susceptibility, which relates the field in a medium and the polar-
</p>
<p>ization of the medium. We determine the classical absorption coefficient of a medium.
</p>
<p>Comparing the classical absorption coefficient with the absorption coefficient derived
</p>
<p>earlier by quantum mechanical arguments, we obtain a quantum mechanical expres-
</p>
<p>sion of the dielectric susceptibility. The susceptibility of an active medium depends

<p>linearly on the population difference. We mention the Kramers&ndash;Kronig relations,
</p>
<p>which relate real and imaginary part of a physical response function&mdash;the polariza-
</p>
<p>tion of a medium is the response to an external field and the dielectric susceptibility
</p>
<p>is the corresponding response function.
</p>
<p>According to Maxwell&rsquo;s equations, a laser oscillation can be driven either by a
</p>
<p>high frequency electric polarization or by a high frequency current.
</p>
<p>9.1 Maxwell&rsquo;s Equations
</p>
<p>To describe the response of a medium to an electromagnetic field, we make use of
</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s equations,
</p>
<p>&nabla; &times; H = j +
&part; D
</p>
<p>&part;t
, (9.1)
</p>
<p>&nabla; &times; E = &minus;
&part;B
</p>
<p>&part;t
, (9.2)
</p>
<p>&nabla; &middot; E = 0, (9.3)
&nabla; &middot; B = 0. (9.4)
</p>
<p>&nabla; = (&part;/&part;x, &part;/&part;y, &part;/&part;z) is the del operator (=Nabla operator), E the electric field,
D the displacement field, j the electric current density of a high frequency electric
</p>
<p>current carried by free-electrons, H the magnetic field and B the magnetic induction.
</p>
<p>We exclude, with&nabla; &middot; E = 0, local charge accumulations. Material equations provide
further relations:
</p>
<p>D(E) = ε0 E + P(E), (9.5)
j = j(E), (9.6)
</p>
<p>B = &micro;0 H, (9.7)
</p>
<p>where ε0 = 8.86 &times; 10&minus;12 A s V&minus;1 m&minus;1 is the electric field constant, &micro;0 = 4π &times;
10&minus;7 V s A&minus;1 m&minus;1 the magnetic field constant and ε0&micro;0 = c&minus;2. We ignore, using the
relation B = &micro;0 H , magnetic effects. The displacement field is the sum of the field
(times ε0) and the high frequency polarization P , which itself depends on the field.
</p>
<p>The current density depends on the field. The quantities E, P and j can depend on
</p>
<p>time and location. We can write the first Maxwell equation in the form
</p>
<p>&nabla; &times; H = j + ε0
&part;E
</p>
<p>&part;t
+
</p>
<p>&part; P
</p>
<p>&part;t
. (9.8)
</p>
<p>We now assume that the response is linear and introduce the dielectric suscepti-
</p>
<p>bility χ̃ , the dielectric constant ε̃ and the conductivity σ̃ by the relations:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.1 Maxwell&rsquo;s Equations 139
</p>
<p>P = ε0 χ̃ E, (9.9)
D = ε0 ε̃ E, (9.10)
ε̃ = 1 + χ̃ , (9.11)
j = σ̃ E. (9.12)
</p>
<p>The function χ̃ is a linear response function. It characterizes the linear response
</p>
<p>of the polarization of a dielectric medium to a high frequency electric field. Corre-
</p>
<p>spondingly, ε̃ is the linear response function for the dielectric displacement while σ̃
</p>
<p>is the linear response function for the current density.
</p>
<p>The first Maxwell equation describing linear response is given by
</p>
<p>&nabla; &times; H = j + ε0
&part;(ε̃ E)
</p>
<p>&part;t
= σ̃ E + ε0
</p>
<p>&part;ε̃
</p>
<p>&part;t
E + ε0 ε̃
</p>
<p>&part;E
</p>
<p>&part;t
. (9.13)
</p>
<p>When a medium is in thermal equilibrium, then, &part;ε̃/&part;t = 0. But, the dielectric con-
stant can be time-dependent, &part;ε̃/&part;t �= 0, for an active medium&mdash;which is always in
a nonequilibrium state.
</p>
<p>The first Maxwell equation contains the displacement current density
</p>
<p>jd =
&part; D
</p>
<p>&part;t
= ε0
</p>
<p>&part;E
</p>
<p>&part;t
+
</p>
<p>&part; P
</p>
<p>&part;t
, (9.14)
</p>
<p>which is the sum of the displacement current density ε0&part;E/&part;t and the polarization
</p>
<p>current density &part; P/&part;t . The polarization current density corresponds to the portion
</p>
<p>of the displacement current density that is due to polarization of a medium.
</p>
<p>We assume that high frequency field, polarization and current are oriented along
</p>
<p>x . A field
</p>
<p>Ẽ = A eiωt , (9.15)

<p>possibilities to obtain gain:
</p>
<p>&bull; A high frequency polarization can be the origin of gain or
&bull; A high frequency electric current can be the origin of gain.
</p>
<p>In the following sections (Sects. 9.3&ndash;9.6), we will present a model of a dielectric
</p>
<p>medium. The model is suited to study basic properties of lasers (Sects. 9.7&ndash;9.10).
</p>
<p>The model describes a dielectric medium that shows a homogeneously broadened
</p>
<p>narrow line.
</p>
<p>We will begin with a derivation of the classical susceptibility and the classical
</p>
<p>absorption coefficient αcl of an ensemble of classical oscillators. A comparison of
</p>
<p>the classical absorption coefficient with the quantum mechanical expression of the
</p>
<p>absorption coefficient αabs (Sect. 7.2) will lead to a procedure that allows us to change
</p>
<p>from classical expressions of the susceptibility to quantum mechanical expressions.
</p>
<p>The model yields the complex susceptibility of a dielectric medium consisting of an
</p>
<p>ensemble of two-level atomic systems.
</p>
<p>We will show later (in Chaps. 19 and 32) how a high frequency electric current

<p>is the (general) complex Lorentz function. At frequencies around a narrow Lorentzian
</p>
<p>resonance, the susceptibility is χ̃ = a&prime;g̃L , where a&prime; = a/2 and
</p>
<p>g̃L = gL,disp &minus; igL,res =
1
</p>
<p>ω0 &minus; ω + i∆ω0/2
. (9.83)
</p>
<p>Many textbooks treat the theory of classical dispersion (see preceding section) or
</p>
<p>present quantum mechanical derivations of the susceptibility; see, for instance,
</p>
<p>[5, 6].
</p>
<p>9.5 Polarization of an Active Medium
</p>
<p>A field E = A cosωt in a medium produces a polarization. In the special case that
the frequency of the field is equal to the resonance frequency of the atomic transition
</p>
<p>(ω = ω0), we obtain
</p>
<p>P = ε0χ2 sin(ω0t)A =
2π ε0
</p>
<p>ω0
(N1 &minus; N2) b21(ω0) sin(ω0t)A. (9.84)
</p>
<p>The polarization of an inactive medium (Fig. 9.2a) is delayed (by π/2 for ω = ω0)
with respect to the field that creates the polarization while the polarization of an
</p>
<p>active medium (Fig. 9.2b) is advanced (by π/2) with respect to the field.
</p>
<p>An external electric field in a nonactive medium delivers energy to an ensemble
</p>
<p>of two-level atomic systems. The power transferred to a single two-level system is
</p>
<p>equal to
</p>
<p>force times path
</p>
<p>time
= q E ẋ = E ṗ. (9.85)
</p>
<p>The power, averaged over time, a field (frequency ω = ω0) delivers to a medium of
polarization P = (N1 &minus; N2)p is equal to
</p>
<p>W = &lt; E

</p>
<p>The power is negative, W &lt; 0, if a medium is active: then the polarization delivers
</p>
<p>energy to the field. The polarization is maintained by pumping of the active medium.
</p>
<p>Thus, the polarization mediates gain of the field. Pump power is converted&mdash;via the
</p>
<p>polarization&mdash;to power of the high frequency field.
</p>
<p>If an active medium interacts with radiation at a frequency that is not the resonance
</p>
<p>frequency (ω �= ω0), the phase shift between field and polarization is
</p>
<p>tan ϕ(ω) = χ2(ω)/χ1(ω) (9.87)
</p>
<p>and the power is
</p>
<p>W (ω) = W0 sin ϕ, (9.88)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>W0 = (N1 &minus; N2)
πε0
</p>
<p>ω0
b21(ω0)A
</p>
<p>2 (9.89)
</p>
<p>is the power delivered by the field for ω = ω0. Accordingly, the power transfer is
smaller at frequencies outside the resonance frequency, that is, the gain in a laser
</p>
<p>medium is largest for radiation at the resonance frequency.
</p>
<p>In an active medium of a laser, after a sudden turning on of the population differ-
</p>
<p>ence (at t = 0), the atomic dipole moments oscillate with arbitrary phases relative
to each other and therefore the polarization is zero (Fig. 9.3, left). An electric field
</p>
<p>of small amplitude A(t = 0) produces a weak polarization and this enhances the
field. The amplitude of the field and the amplitude of the polarization grow together
</p>
<p>by the mutual interaction of field and polarization until a steady state oscillation is
</p>
<p>established (right).
</p>
<p>The interplay of the radiation and the atomic dipoles results in the growth of both
</p>
<p>the field and the polarization. With increasing field, the atomic dipole oscillations
</p>
<p>become more and more synchronized to the field. Accordingly, the polarization
</p>
<p>becomes more and more able to deliver energy to the field. The energy necessary
</p>
<p>for the buildup of the field originates from the excitation energy of the ensemble
</p>
<p>of two-level atomic systems. The initial field that starts oscillation can be due to
</p>
<p>spontaneous emission of radiation by the ensemble of two-level atomic systems (in
</p>
<p>the visible, UV, and X-ray range) or due to thermal radiation (in the far infrared
</p>
<p>spectral region).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.5 Polarization of an Active Medium 151
</p>
<p>At steady state oscillation, synchronization of the field and the polarization is
</p>
<p>maintained. Loss of polarization is compensated by pumping. The field synchronizes
</p>
<p>the atomic dipole oscillations that are produced by the pumping.
</p>
<p>A high frequency polarization is characteristic of a large variety of excitations
</p>
<p>used in lasers:
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic excitations of atoms, molecules, or ions.
&bull; Electronic excitations by interband transitions in bipolar semiconductor lasers.
&bull; Electronic excitations by intersubband transitions in quantum cascade lasers.
&bull; Vibrational excitations of molecules.
&bull; Rotational excitations of molecules.
</p>
<p>The origin of electric dipole moments are oscillating charges in electronic and vibra-
</p>
<p>tional excitations and rotating charges in rotational excitations.
</p>
<p>Before we treat the question how the amplitudes of the field and of the polarization
</p>
<p>build up during the onset of laser oscillation, we introduce the polarization current.
</p>
<p>9.6 Polarization Current
</p>
<p>If transverse relaxation is absent, we can introduce the polarization current charac-
</p>
<p>terized by the polarization current density
</p>
<p>jpol = Nqẋ = dP/dt. (9.90)
</p>
<p>The polarization current density is equal to the rate of change of the polarization. By
</p>
<p>differentiation of (9.53) with respect to time and multiplication of the equation by
</p>
<p>Nq, we obtain (with q = &minus;e)

<p>Making use of (9.69), we obtain quantum mechanical expressions of the real and

</p>
<p>The real part of the polarization conductivity of a nonactive medium (Fig. 9.4a)
</p>
<p>is positive and has a Lorentzian shape. The (negative) imaginary part is positive
</p>
<p>for ω &lt; ω0 and negative for ω &gt; ω0. The polarization conductivities are dynamical
</p>
<p>conductivities (=high frequency conductivities). The real part of the polarization
conductivity shows a resonance curve with the maximum at ω0. The signs of the
</p>
<p>polarization conductivities are reversed in case of an active medium (Fig. 9.4b).

<p>9.6 Polarization Current 153
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.5 Polarization current and field at resonance a of an inactive medium and b of an active
</p>
<p>medium
</p>
<p>Thus, we found that the real part of the polarization conductivity of a medium with
</p>
<p>a homogeneously damped resonance transition has the shape of a Lorentz resonance
</p>
<p>function and the imaginary part has the shape of a Lorentz dispersion function.
</p>
<p>We consider the special case that ω = ω0 and that therefore σ2 = 0. With E =
A cosω0t , we obtain
</p>
<p>jpol = σ pol1 (ω0)E = (N1 &minus; N2)&times; 2πε0b21(ω0) cos(ω0t) A. (9.103)
</p>
<p>The polarization current of a nonactive medium has the same phase as the field
</p>
<p>(Fig. 9.5a) and jpol E is positive at any moment. The field experiences damping. Power
</p>
<p>of the field is converted to heat due to relaxation of the polarization. The polarization
</p>
<p>current of an active medium has a phase of π relative to the field (Fig. 9.5b). The
</p>
<p>product jpol E is negative at any moment. The field is amplified. Pump power is
</p>
<p>converted to power of the field. Amplification is mediated by the polarization current.
</p>
<p>An electric field delivers to an oscillating charge q the
</p>
<p>power =
work
</p>
<p>time
= q E ẋ (9.104)
</p>
<p>and to an ensemble of electrons the power jpol E . The time average of the power
</p>
<p>transferred from the field to the polarization current is given by
</p>
<p>(N1 &minus; N2)σ1(ω0)A &lt; cos2 ω0t &gt;t= (N1 &minus; N2)&times; πε0b21(ω0)A2. (9.105)
</p>
<p>To describe the resonance interaction of a medium with radiation, we will make
</p>
<p>use of both the polarization and the polarization current. The polarization is the
</p>
<p>fundamental quantity. The use of the polarization current density&mdash;in the case that
</p>
<p>transverse relaxation can be neglected&mdash;has the advantage that we can write some
</p>
<p>expressions in a simpler form, particularly in the special case that ω = ω0; then the
phase between current and field is either zero or π .</p>

<p>154 9 Driving a Laser Oscillation
</p>
<p>9.7 Laser Oscillation Driven by a Polarization
</p>
<p>We now treat the case that the polarization is the origin of gain and that the active
</p>
<p>medium is a purely dielectric medium ( j = 0). The wave equation has the form
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>c2

<p>&part;2 E

</p>
<p>ε0
</p>
<p>&part;2 P
</p>
<p>&part;t2
. (9.106)
</p>
<p>We assume, for simplicity, that the active medium is optically isotropic and fills a
</p>
<p>Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator completely. We also assume that the field does not vary over
</p>
<p>the cross-sectional area of the resonator. We can write
</p>
<p>&part;2 E(z, t)
</p>
<p>&part;t2

<p>&part;2 E(z, t)

<p>ε0
</p>
<p>&part;2 P(z, t)
</p>
<p>&part;t2
. (9.107)
</p>
<p>The field in the resonator represents a standing wave
</p>
<p>E(z, t) = E(t) sin kz. (9.108)
</p>
<p>This leads, with k2 = ω2res/c2, where ωres is the resonance frequency of the resonator,
to the differential equation
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>d2 E
</p>

</p>
<p>ε0
</p>
<p>d2 P(z, t)
</p>
<p>dt2
. (9.109)
</p>
<p>The polarization has the same z dependence as the field. Therefore, we can divide
</p>
<p>by sin kz, except at the positions where E(z) = 0. Thus, we obtain, with P(z, t) =
P(t) sin kz and P = P(t), the differential equation:

<p>ε0
</p>

</p>
<p>dt2
. (9.110)
</p>
<p>In our derivation of the wave equation, we did not include damping of the field
</p>
<p>that is, for instance, due to output coupling of radiation. We now introduce damping
</p>
<p>by use of the differential equation of the empty resonator:
</p>
<p>d2 E
</p>
<p>dt2
+ κ
</p>
<p>dE
</p>
<p>dt
+ ω2res E = 0, (9.111)
</p>
<p>where κ is the damping coefficient of the resonator. We assume that κ ≪ ωres, i.e.,
that the field in the empty resonator is given by

</p>
<p>We now assume that transverse relaxation of the polarization is absent and treat

<p>the particular case that all three frequencies&mdash;laser frequency, transition frequency
</p>
<p>and resonance frequency of the resonator&mdash;coincide with each other,

</p>
<p>We now investigate the large-signal behavior. We assume that the amplitude A(t)

the steady state value.
</p>
<p>&bull; The photon density reaches half the steady state value at t = ton.

</p>
<p>described by the relation
</p>
<p>jpol(t) = σ pol1 E(t). (9.161)
</p>
<p>It follows from the negative slope that jpol(t) and E(t) have opposite phases. During
</p>
<p>the onset of laser oscillation, the negative polarization conductivity varies with time
</p>
<p>(Fig. 9.7b). The variation is very slow, i.e., σ
pol
</p>
<p>1 is nearly constant during a cycle of
</p>
<p>the field. The absolute value of the polarization conductivity is large at t = 0 and
decreases with increasing amplitude of the field until it reaches the steady state value
</p>
<p>|σ pol1,&infin;| = ε0κ .
That the magnitude of the polarization conductivity σ
</p>
<p>pol
</p>
<p>1 changes with time is the
</p>
<p>consequence of the quantum mechanical origin of gain: during the buildup of the
</p>

</p>
<p>decreases.</p>

<p>9.8 Relaxation of the Polarization
</p>
<p>Relaxation of the polarization occurs in ensembles of excited two-level systems. We
</p>
<p>consider the case that all atomic oscillators in a medium oscillate, under the action of
</p>
<p>a laser field, at the same frequency and with the same phase. We suppose that energy
</p>
<p>relaxation is absent. Then, the dipole moment of each of the oscillators is
</p>
<p>pi = p0 cos (ωt + ϕ0), (9.162)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>p0 = q x0 (9.163)
</p>
<p>is the amplitude of the dipole moment, +q and &ndash;q the oscillating charges, and x0
the amplitude of the oscillation. The polarization is defined as the dipole moment
</p>
<p>density,
</p>
<p>P =
&sum;N0
</p>
<p>i=1
pi = P0 cos (ωt + ϕ0). (9.164)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.8 Relaxation of the Polarization 163
</p>
<p>N0 is the number of atomic oscillators per unit volume and
</p>
<p>P0 = N0 p0 = N0 q0x0 (9.165)
</p>
<p>is the amplitude of the polarization.
</p>
<p>We now assume that we suddenly turn off the laser field. Then, dephasing
</p>
<p>processes can destroy the polarization. We assume that dephasing processes occur
</p>
<p>randomly in time. The number of oscillators that undergo dephasing in a small time
</p>
<p>interval dt is
</p>
<p>dN =
N
</p>
<p>T2
dt. (9.166)
</p>
<p>N is the number of coherently oscillating dipoles per unit volume and T2 is the
</p>
<p>dephasing time. It follows that
</p>
<p>N (t) = N0 e&minus; t/T2 . (9.167)
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the polarization decreases exponentially,
</p>
<p>P(t) = P0 e&minus; t/T2 . (9.168)
</p>
<p>The polarization decays with the dephasing time T2, which is called, in connection
</p>
<p>with the decay of the polarization, transverse relaxation time or phase relaxation
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>We assumed that the population of excited two-level systems remained constant,
</p>
<p>i.e., that T2 was much smaller than the energy relaxation time T1 of the upper energy
</p>
<p>level, T2 ≪ T1. In the case that T2 ≫ T1, the change of coherently oscillating dipoles
is
</p>
<p>dN =
N
</p>
<p>2T1
dt. (9.169)
</p>
<p>Now, the polarization is related to the amplitude of the oscillation that decays with
</p>
<p>the time constant 2T1 (while the energy content in the oscillator decays with T1).
</p>
<p>In the intermediate case, T2 &asymp; T1, the polarization decays according to
</p>
<p>P(t) = P0 exp
[(
</p>

</p>

<p>In connection with the polarization, the time T1 is called longitudinal relaxation time

<p>164 9 Driving a Laser Oscillation
</p>
<p>9.9 Laser Equations
</p>
<p>We study the laser oscillation of a more general case (assuming again that the pop-
</p>
<p>ulation difference is suddenly turned on):
</p>
<p>&bull; ω �= ωres �= ω0; i.e., laser frequency, resonance frequency of the resonator and
transition frequency have different values.
</p>
<p>&bull; The polarization undergoes both longitudinal and transverse relaxation.
</p>
<p>Our goal is to find differential equations that relate the field, the polarization and the
</p>
<p>population difference. We make use of the quantities:
</p>
<p>&bull; ω = laser frequency.
&bull; ωres = resonance frequency of the laser resonator.
&bull; ω0 = transition frequency; ω0 = (E2 &minus; E1)/�.
&bull; Ã = amplitude of the field.
&bull; B̃ = amplitude of the polarization.
&bull; ∆N = N2 &minus; N1 = population difference.
&bull; ∆N0 = (N2 &minus; N1)0 = initial population difference.
&bull; κ/2 = 1/(2τp); 2/κ = lifetime of the field in the laser resonator.
&bull; T1 = spontaneous lifetime of the population difference = longitudinal relaxation
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>&bull; T2 = transverse relaxation time.
&bull; ∆ω0/2 = 1/(2T1)+ 1/T2; 2/∆ω0 = relaxation time of the polarization.
&bull; b021 = �ω0 Bω21g(ω0) = growth rate constant atω0.
</p>
<p>The energy conservation law requires: the change of the population difference
</p>
<p>times the quantum energy of a photon is equal to the change of the average density
</p>
<p>of the energy contained in the field and the polarization,
</p>
<p>(

<p>�ω = &minus; &lt; E
dP
</p>
<p>dt
&gt;t,z; (9.171)
</p>
<p>the average is taken over a temporal and a spatial period of the field. Atomic excitation
</p>
<p>energy is converted to field and polarization energy.
</p>
<p>We have seen (in Sect. 9.7) that a polarization can drive a laser oscillation. We
</p>
<p>now assume that we inject into the laser resonator of an oscillating laser an external
</p>
<p>high frequency electric field E1. The external field acts as an additional source term
</p>
<p>κ1dE1/dt , where κ1 is a coupling constant.
</p>
<p>We make use of laser equations of second order, namely of (9.113) with the
</p>
<p>additional source term and of (9.76). We then have, together with (9.171), the laser
</p>
<p>equations:</p>

<p>These five equations describe dynamical processes in laser oscillators.
</p>
<p>Example Injection locking of a laser. Injection locking (=frequency locking=phase
locking) of a self-excited oscillator means that an external high frequency field,
</p>
<p>injected into the resonator of the oscillator, forces the oscillator to assume the fre-
</p>
<p>quency of the external field rather than to execute an oscillation at its &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
</p>
<p>frequency of the free running laser. At the same time, the field in the resonator has
</p>
<p>a fixed phase relative to the external field. Injection of an external field (frequency
</p>
<p>ωL ) of a small amplitude can force a laser (natural frequency ωL) to oscillate at ω1.
</p>
<p>The natural frequency is not necessarily the frequency of maximum gain but is the
</p>
<p>frequency that is determined by the corresponding condition (2.80). The small-power
</p>
<p>laser acts as &ldquo;seed&rdquo; laser (=master oscillator) of the large-power laser (=slave laser)
as shown in Fig. 9.8a. The frequency of the seed laser can be chosen in a range around
</p>
<p>the frequency of maximum gain (Fig. 9.8b). The power of the frequency-locked laser
</p>
<p>is the same as that of the free running laser. Injection of a monochromatic field results
</p>
<p>in a large occupation number of photons of frequency ω1. Thus, the laser starts oscil-
</p>
<p>lation at ω1 rather than at ω0. If a laser is already oscillating at ωL and the seed laser
</p>
<p>starts, the laser frequency &ldquo;jumps&rdquo; to ω1. Injection locking by use of a frequency
</p>
<p>stabilized small-power laser can result in a stabilization of the large-power laser with
</p>
<p>respect to frequency and output power. The minimum power necessary for phase
</p>
<p>locking and the locking range can be derived by use of the five laser equations; a
</p>
<p>detailed treatment of injection locking can be found in [1].
</p>
<p>Frequency locking of an oscillator is a general phenomenon. Two mechanical
</p>
<p>oscillators that are weakly coupled can force themselves to oscillate at a fixed phase.
</p>
<p>In 1865, Huygens observed phase locking of two pendulum clocks fixed at a wall
</p>
<p>and mechanically coupled via the wall. Injection locking of an electrical classical
</p>
<p>self-excited oscillator (Sect. 31.8) is well-known: a high frequency current flowing
</p>
<p>through the active element of a self-excited classical oscillator is superimposed with</p>

<p>[41&ndash;45].
</p>
<p>9.10 Laser-van der Pol Equation
</p>
<p>According to the last section, we can characterize laser oscillation (if transverse
</p>
<p>relaxation is absent) in slowly varying envelope approximation by the equations:

<p>E(t) = A(t)cos ωt , (9.195)

</p>
<p>This is the laser-van der Pol equation. It is a nonlinear differential equation of first
</p>
<p>order for the amplitude A.
</p>
<p>We have found in Sect. 9.7 that the laser equations lead, in slowly varying envelope
</p>
<p>approximation, to analytical expressions for the time dependences of the amplitude
</p>
<p>of field, (9.161) and, furthermore of the amplitude of the polarization and of the

</p>
<p>Thus, the analytical solution of (9.169) for A(t), equation (9.146), provides also
</p>
<p>analytical expressions for the polarization current (and therefore of the polarization)
</p>
<p>and of the population difference.
</p>
<p>The laser-van der Pol equation is always applicable for description of a laser
</p>
<p>oscillation (if transverse relaxation is absent). The reason is the following: for
</p>
<p>all lasers, the gain per period T of the laser field is small compared with unity,
</p>
<p>(γ0 &minus; κ)T ≪ 1. This is the condition for the applicability of the slowly varying
envelope approximation.
</p>
<p>We have derived the laser-van der Pol equation by using the condition that laser
</p>
<p>frequency, atomic transition frequency, and resonance frequency of the resonator
</p>
<p>coincide with each other. The equation is, however, also applicable for a high fre-
</p>
<p>quency field composed of fields of different frequencies if the frequencies have values
</p>
<p>near the frequency of maximum gain and near the eigenfrequency of the laser res-
</p>
<p>onator, i.e., if the gain curve is sufficiently broad and the Q value of the laser resonator
</p>
<p>is sufficiently small. The van der Pol equation of the laser is suitable to describe, for
</p>
<p>instance, mode beating in a laser that oscillates on two modes at the same time; see,
</p>
<p>for instance, [5, 40&ndash;42]. It can also be applied to treat frequency locking.
</p>
<p>The van der Pol equation in slowly varying amplitude approximation,
</p>
<p>dA
</p>
<p>dt
&minus;
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
(γ0 &minus; κ)A + βA3 = 0, (9.199)
</p>
<p>is a differential equation of first order. It describes an oscillation of the quantity
</p>
<p>y = A(t)cos ωt, where A(t) is a slowly varying amplitude, γ0 is a growth coefficient,
κ is a damping term, and β is a term that follows from the mechanism responsible for
</p>
<p>oscillation. The equation has two solutions. One of the solutions is A = 0. It follows
</p>
<p>that the occurrence of oscillation supposes an initial amplitude that is nonzero. A
</p>
<p>small initial amplitude causes exponential growth of the amplitude. The A3 term is
</p>
<p>responsible for limitation of the amplitude. In a laser, the initial amplitude of the
</p>
<p>laser field stems from spontaneous emission of radiation by the active medium. The
</p>
<p>equation holds only if the net gain per oscillation period is small compared with 1,
</p>
<p>that is, if (γ0 &minus; κ)T ≪ 1, as already mentioned.
The three equations (9.196) through (9.198) are the most simple laser equations
</p>
<p>but represent a complete set of laser equations.
</p>
<p>The differential equation (9.196) is also suitable, to analyze oscillation of a classi-
</p>
<p>cal model oscillator if (γ0 &minus; κ)T ≪ 1. In a classical oscillator model, the parameters
γ0, κ , and β represent quantities, which characterize mechanisms that differ com-
</p>
<p>pletely from the mechanisms in a laser (see Chap. 31). The equation (9.196) is the
</p>
<p>slowly varying envelope approximation of the (general) van der Pol equation that
</p>
<p>is a nonlinear differential equation of second order (see Sect. 31.8 and Problems to</p>

</p>
<p>this chapter). In contrast to laser oscillators, classical oscillators work in most cases
</p>
<p>with a much larger gain per period. Thus, a laser oscillator is the application of the
</p>
<p>classical van der Pol equation in slowly varying envelope approximation. (The van
</p>
<p>der Pol oscillator has been reported by van der Pol [243] long before the invention
</p>
<p>of the laser.)

<p>9.11 Kramers&ndash;Kronig Relations
</p>
<p>The Kramers&ndash;Kronig relations relate the real part of a linear response function and
</p>
<p>the imaginary part. If the real part of a linear response function is known for all
</p>
<p>frequencies, then the imaginary part can be calculated for all frequencies. And if
</p>
<p>the imaginary part of a quantity is known for all frequencies, the real part can be
</p>
<p>calculated for all frequencies. The Kramers&ndash;Kronig relations for the complex sus-
</p>
<p>ceptibility are

ization P̃ = ε0(χ1 &minus; iχ2)Ẽ . The susceptibilities χ1 and χ2 are related according to

<p>The Kramers&ndash;Kronig relations are a consequence of causality. The Dutch physi-
</p>
<p>cists Kramers [46] and Kronig [47] derived the relations independently from each

<p>other. The relations are treated in many textbooks on Solid State Physics and Optics;

</p>
<p>Besides the normalization condition, the values of x0 and ∆x0 are not restricted.
</p>
<p>For a narrow resonance function, with∆x0 ≪ x0, the integral from zero to infinity
is approximately unity. We use this approximation of the Lorentzian function to
</p>
<p>describe narrow resonances in physical systems and designate the function as Lorentz
</p>
<p>resonance function, gL,res(x).
</p>
<p>In the case that a resonance is not narrow, we use the function that we call gen-
</p>
<p>eral Lorentz resonance function. The Kramers&ndash;Kronig relations connect the general
</p>
<p>Lorentz resonance function with the general Lorentz dispersion function.
</p>
<p>In the book, we use the following functions.
</p>
<p>&bull; G̃L = GL,res &minus; i GL,disp, general complex Lorentz function.
&bull; GL,res, general Lorentz resonance function (= real part of the general Lorentz func-

<p>tion).

<p>The Lorentz resonance function describes the frequency dependence of the gain

<p>9.13 A Third Remark About the History of the Laser
</p>
<p>We come back to the question: why did it take&mdash;after the discovery of stimulated
</p>
<p>emission by Einstein&mdash;40 years until the maser and the laser were invented? The
</p>
<p>laser is an apparatus developed by experimentalists. We consider the development
</p>
<p>of spectroscopy after stimulated emission became known. In the time from 1900
</p>
<p>to 1930, Berlin was a center of spectroscopy, with two outstanding spectroscopists:
</p>
<p>Heinrich Rubens (1865&ndash;1922) and Rudolf Ladenburg (1882&ndash;1952). Rubens devel-
</p>
<p>oped methods suited to study the far infrared spectral range. His result (1900) with
</p>
<p>respect to the spectral distribution of radiation emitted by a thermal radiation source
</p>
<p>was a basis of the derivation of Planck&rsquo;s radiation law. One of Rubens&rsquo; Ph.D stu-
</p>
<p>dents, Marianus Czerny (1896&ndash;1985), studied the (far infrared) rotational spectrum
</p>
<p>of HCl [49]; he found that the positions of the absorption lines did not agree with
</p>
<p>predictions of classical physics. Richard Tolman (Caltech, Pasadena) analyzed in
</p>
<p>1924 [50] Czerny&rsquo;s data (that he knew before publication by Czerny) with respect to
</p>
<p>the strength of absorption, taking into account thermal populations of energy levels,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.13 A Third Remark About the History of the Laser 173
</p>
<p>which had transition energies of the order of kT . Tolman included in his analysis
</p>
<p>stimulated emission (then called &ldquo;negative absorption&rdquo;). Tolman discussed in his
</p>
<p>lectures about quantum mechanics the three processes described by Einstein. Thus,
</p>
<p>stimulated emission was known in the physics community (see [22]).
</p>
<p>Based on the quantum theory of Einstein and making use of the correspondence
</p>
<p>principle, Hendrik A. Kramers [51] developed a theory of the refractive index of
</p>
<p>gases taking account of stimulated emission. He showed that the refractive index
</p>
<p>in the vicinity of a resonance line of an atomic gas is expected to decrease if a
</p>
<p>portion of atoms is in the excited state, i.e., if the population difference is reduced.
</p>
<p>The effect that is due to stimulated emission was called &ldquo;negative dispersion&rdquo;. In
</p>
<p>1928, Rudolf Ladenburg and coworkers [52&ndash;56] found experimentally that stimu-
</p>
<p>lated emission resulted in a reduction of the refractive index of excited neon. Making
</p>
<p>use of an interferometric technique combined with a spectral analysis, Ladenburg
</p>
<p>and coworkers measured the change of refractive index of a gas (neon), contained in
</p>
<p>a long tube, that was excited by a gas discharge. The refractive index in the neigh-
</p>
<p>borhood of lines decreased, at strong current, with increasing discharge current, i.e.,
</p>
<p>with increasing excitation. Thus, Ladenburg and coworkers performed experimental
</p>
<p>studies of energy levels of gases in nonequilibrium states. Ladenburg studied (begin-
</p>
<p>ning in 1908) atomic gases by analyzing emission spectra excited by gas discharges.
</p>
<p>He emigrated in 1928 to the USA (becoming professor at Princeton University).
</p>
<p>In Germany, the activities in the field of experimental spectroscopy were strongly
</p>
<p>reduced after the stock market crash in 1929 and when Hitler came to power. In the
</p>
<p>U.S.A. and other countries, the Great Depression resulted in a reduced investment
</p>
<p>in physics. It seems that atomic physics was in principal understood at the end of
</p>
<p>the 1920s. During the 1930 s and especially after the discovery of nuclear fission,
</p>
<p>the field of nuclear physics became most attractive for physicists. Great interest
</p>
<p>in spectroscopy (including microwave spectroscopy) began with the discovery of
</p>
<p>masers and lasers.
</p>
<p>Townes writes in his memoirs [22]: &ldquo;By the 1950s, then, the idea of getting
</p>
<p>amplification by stimulated emission of radiation was already recognized here and
</p>
<p>there, but for one reason or another, nobody really saw the idea&rsquo;s potency or pub-
</p>
<p>lished it, except for me and the Russians [Basov and Prokhorov], whose work was
</p>
<p>then unknown for me.&rdquo; The essential new idea, besides the idea to make use of
</p>
<p>atomic transitions in a system with population inversion, was the idea&mdash;introduced
</p>
<p>by Townes&mdash;to use a resonator in order to realize a self-excited oscillator. The next
</p>
<p>step, toward the optical maser (laser), was the idea to use an optical resonator, i.e., a
</p>
<p>resonator without sidewalls.
</p>
<p>Was there a chance to invent the laser already in the late 1920s? In his first paper
</p>
<p>mentioning negative dispersion [52], Ladenburg reported the formula of the refractive
</p>
<p>index of a gas near a resonance line but outside the range of absorption,

</p>
<p>negative dispersion, whose theoretical importance is unquestionable.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Ladenburg and coworkers used an arrangement [53] shown in Fig. 9.9a. The opti-
</p>
<p>cal arrangement consisted of a Jamin interferometer. One arm of the interferometer
</p>
<p>contained a tube filled with neon gas (at low pressure) and the other arm contained
</p>
<p>an evacuated reference tube. A beam of white light from an arc discharge lamp was
</p>
<p>divided into two beams (one traversing the tube with the gas and the other traversing
</p>
<p>the empty tube). Then the two beams were superimposed and passed a diffraction
</p>
<p>grating. The interference pattern on a photo plate contained information on the fre-
</p>
<p>quency dependence of the refractive index. At large current, both the lower and the
</p>
<p>upper level of a resonance transition were occupied. The results [54&ndash;56] indicated
</p>
<p>that the refractive index decreased as predicted by theory. The relative population
</p>
<p>difference (N1 &minus; N2g1/g2)/N1 was most likely between ten and forty percent. The
arrangement had similarities to that of a helium&ndash;neon laser (Fig. 9.9b). The dimen-
</p>
<p>sion of the helium tube, the gas pressure, and the strength of current were similar.
</p>
<p>There are two important differences: the helium&ndash;neon laser contains, in addition to
</p>
<p>neon, also helium and the gas tube is enclosed between highly reflecting mirrors;
</p>
<p>additionally, the gas tube of a laser is closed by Brewster windows. The helium is
</p>
<p>essential to obtain a population inversion and the high-reflectivity mirrors are nec-
</p>
<p>essary to reach laser threshold. The effect of energy transfer from helium to neon
</p>
<p>atoms was not known at Ladenburg&rsquo;s time and highly reflecting dielectric mirrors
</p>
<p>were not available. A helium&ndash;neon laser generating visible light was realized in
</p>
<p>1962. If Ladenburg or somebody else would have had the idea of a neon laser, a
</p>
<p>more elaborated investigation of gas discharges and of laser mirrors would have
</p>
<p>been necessary.</p>

<p>9.13 A Third Remark About the History of the Laser 175
</p>
<p>In the 1920 s and the beginning 1930s, there was not yet much knowledge about
</p>
<p>optical properties of dielectric crystals, of doped dielectric crystals and of semicon-
</p>
<p>ductors. Therefore, a solid state laser would not have been a reachable goal at the

<p>time. Research in the field of solid state physics grew strongly between 1920 and
</p>
<p>1960 [57].

</p>
<p>Cavity Resonator
</p>
<p>After a basic description of a laser in the first parts of the book, we now are dealing
</p>
<p>with the question how we can operate a laser. For this purpose, we will first discuss
</p>
<p>laser resonators. In this chapter, we treat the cavity resonator, which is a closed
</p>
<p>resonator. In the next chapter, we will study the open resonator.
</p>
<p>We solve the wave equation for electromagnetic radiation in a metallic rectangular
</p>
<p>cavity and determine the eigenfrequencies and the field distributions of modes of a
</p>
<p>cavity resonator. A cavity resonator has a low frequency cutoff. The cutoff frequency,
</p>
<p>determined by the geometry of the resonator, corresponds to a resonance of lowest
</p>
<p>order. The field of a mode is a standing wave.
</p>
<p>Standing waves composed of two waves that propagate in opposite directions
</p>
<p>along one of the three axes of a rectangular resonator are forbidden modes. A long
</p>
<p>resonator has modes that are composed of waves that propagate nearly parallel to the
</p>
<p>long axis. We express the frequency separation of these modes in a simple way by
</p>
<p>the use of the Fresnel number; we will later see that Fresnel numbers are important
</p>
<p>parameters of the theory of diffraction.
</p>
<p>We finally calculate the mode density that corresponds to frequencies, which are
</p>
<p>large compared to the cutoff frequency. This leads to the expression of the mode
</p>
<p>density we used in connection with the discussion of Planck&rsquo;s radiation law and the
</p>
<p>Einstein coefficients (Sect. 6.7).
</p>
<p>10.1 Cavity Resonators in Various Areas
</p>
<p>Max Planck used the model of a cavity resonator (=&ldquo;hohlraum&rdquo; resonator) to derive
the radiation law.

<p>182 10 Cavity Resonator
</p>
<p>High-Q microwave cavities that are able to store electromagnetic fields of large
</p>
<p>amplitude are suited to accelerate particles in accelerators.
</p>
<p>10.2 Modes of a Cavity Resonator
</p>
<p>We discuss properties of a rectangular metallic cavity resonator (Fig. 10.1). All walls
</p>
<p>are metallic. We assume that the walls are ideal conductors, i.e., that reflection of
</p>
<p>radiation at the walls occurs without absorption loss. The extensions of the cavity
</p>
<p>resonator are: a1 = width (along x axis); a2 = height (along y); L = length (along z).
Coupling of radiation into a resonator is possible, for instance, by means of a hole in
</p>
<p>one of the walls. We treat the interior of the resonator as a vacuum space, ignoring
</p>
<p>the effect of air (or of another medium).
</p>
<p>To describe the electromagnetic field in the resonator, we make use of Maxwell&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>equations
</p>
<p>&nabla; &times; H = &part; D/&part;t, (10.1)
&nabla; &times; E = &minus;&part;B/&part;t, (10.2)
&nabla; &middot; E = 0, (10.3)
&nabla; &middot; B = 0. (10.4)
</p>
<p>E is the electric field, B the magnetic induction, H the magnetic field, D the dielectric
</p>
<p>displacement, ε0 the electric field constant, and μ0 the magnetic field constant. A
</p>
<p>field in vacuum is characterized by
</p>
<p>μ0 H = B, (10.5)
D = ε0 E. (10.6)
</p>
<p>The boundary conditions for electromagnetic fields require continuity of the tangen-
</p>
<p>tial component Et of the electric field at a boundary and continuity of the normal
</p>
<p>component Hn of the H field. The tangential component of the electric field is zero

<p>The frequency distribution of the modes (Fig. 10.2b) shows that there is a forbidden

<p>10.4 Density of Modes of a Cavity Resonator 189
</p>
<p>density of the modes of a cavity resonator increases proportionally to the square of
</p>
<p>the frequency (Fig. 10.5b). It also increases proportional to the volume of the cavity.
</p>
<p>The mode density per unit volume is given by

D̄(ν) =

</p>
<p>Accordingly, D(ν)dν is the number of modes (per unit volume) in the frequency
</p>
<p>interval ν,ν + dν.
The density of modes in a cavity resonator containing an optically isotropic
</p>
<p>medium (refractive index n) is equal to
</p>
<p>D(ν) =
8πν2
</p>
<p>(c/n)3
. (10.48)
</p>
<p>Due to the smaller wavelength, i.e., the larger wave vector of radiation of frequency
</p>
<p>ν, the density of modes of a cavity containing a dielectric medium with the refractive
</p>
<p>index n is by the factor n3 larger than the density of modes of the cavity without a
</p>
<p>medium.
</p>
<p>The density of modes (per unit volume) in free space is the same as the density

<p>10.5 Fresnel Number

=

<p>a/2
</p>
<p>λ
&times;

</p>
<p>L
(10.49)
</p>
<p>is a combination of resonator extensions (width a, height a, length L) and wave-
</p>
<p>length λ. The Fresnel number is dimensionless. Many properties of optic apparatus
</p>
<p>of different size depend solely on F ; the Fresnel number plays an important role in
</p>
<p>the characterization of diffraction occurring in laser resonators (Sect. 11.8).
</p>
<p>We introduce the Fresnel number in a different way. We consider (Fig. 10.6) the
</p>
<p>widening of a light beam by diffraction at an iris diaphragm (diameter a). The angle
</p>
<p>of diffraction is approximately given by
</p>
<p>θ &asymp;
λ

</p>
<p>10.6 TE Waves and TM Waves
</p>
<p>We choose the z axis of a rectangular cavity resonator as a preferred axis. Then we
</p>
<p>can divide the waves, with respect to the z axis, in TE and TM waves:
</p>
<p>&bull; TE wave (=transverse electric wave). The electric field is transverse to z. The
magnetic field has a z component as well as an x or a y component. Or it has z, x ,
</p>
<p>and y components. (A TE wave is also called H wave or magnetic wave.)
</p>
<p>&bull; TM wave (=transverse magnetic wave). The magnetic field is transverse to z. The
electric field has a z component and an x or a y component. Or it has z, x , and y
</p>
<p>components. (A TM wave is also called E wave or electric wave.)
</p>
<p>To calculate the fields of different modes, we have to take into account that the bound-
</p>
<p>ary conditions for electromagnetic fields at the boundary of a perfect conductor are
</p>
<p>Et(wall) = 0 and Hn(wall) = 0. It turns out that a mode of a rectangular cavity res-
onator is either a TE mode or a TM mode; i.e., if a mode is excited, the corresponding
</p>
<p>wave is a TE wave or a TM wave. (For calculations of amplitudes of electric and
</p>
<p>magnetic fields, see Problems).</p>

 is the impedance of free space. The 101 mode is a TE mode, which we can
</p>
<p>design as TE101 mode.
</p>
<p>10.7 Quasioptical Arrangement
</p>
<p>Microwave radiation generated by a microwave oscillator (Chap. 31) can be guided
</p>
<p>by means of waveguides. Emission of radiation into free space is possible by the
</p>
<p>use of an antenna. An antenna mediates the excitation of a wave in free space. A
</p>
<p>free-space wave excited by an antenna consists of a mixture of radiation belonging
</p>
<p>to different modes of free space. The strongest portion of radiation can belong to the
</p>
<p>fundamental (Gaussian) mode (next chapter). However, radiation belonging to other
</p>
<p>modes (corresponding to a power of radiation of the order of 1%) cannot be avoided.
</p>
<p>Vice versa, it is not possible to completely convert radiation belonging to a single
</p>
<p>mode of the free space to radiation of a single mode of a waveguide. The combination
</p>
<p>of microwave and optical techniques leads to quasioptical arrangements [63].

<p>Gaussian Waves and Open Resonators
</p>
<p>A large number of gas and solid state lasers as well as free-electron lasers make use
</p>
<p>of an open resonator.
</p>
<p>Before discussing open resonators, we introduce the Gaussian wave (=Gaussian
beam). It is a kind of a natural mode of electromagnetic radiation in free space. A
</p>
<p>Gaussian wave is a paraxial wave, that is a wave with a well-defined propagation
</p>
<p>direction along the beam axis (z axis) and a small divergence. The amplitude of the
</p>
<p>field perpendicular to the beam axis has a Gaussian distribution. A Gaussian beam
</p>
<p>traveling from z = &minus;&infin; to z = &infin; has a beam waist. Accordingly, the diameter of
the beam shows a minimum at the beam waist.
</p>
<p>A Gaussian wave is a solution of the wave equation&mdash;which we use in the form of
</p>
<p>the Helmholtz equation&mdash;and an appropriate boundary condition: the energy trans-
</p>
<p>ported by the wave through a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction is
</p>
<p>finite. Besides the Gaussian mode (=fundamental Gaussian mode), the wave equa-
tion provides higher order Gaussian modes.
</p>
<p>A Gaussian wave fits to a resonator with spherical mirrors&mdash;a longitudinal mode
</p>
<p>of an open resonator is a standing wave composed of two Gaussian waves propagating
</p>
<p>in opposite directions. Higher order Gaussian modes lead to transverse modes of a
</p>
<p>resonator. A laser with a spherical-mirror resonator is able to generate a Gaussian
</p>
<p>wave.
</p>
<p>The analysis of resonators having mirrors of various curvature shows that there are
</p>
<p>stable and unstable resonators. The confocal, the concentric, and the plane parallel
</p>
<p>resonator are three special types of resonators.
</p>
<p>We describe the effect of diffraction that can be used to suppress laser oscillation
</p>
<p>on transverse modes and to operate a laser on longitudinal modes only.
</p>
<p>We introduce the ray matrix (ABCD matrix) to describe the propagation of paraxial
</p>
<p>optical rays in free space and in optical systems. We show that a Gaussian beam can
</p>
<p>be focused by a lens to an area of a diameter that is equal to about a wavelength of
</p>
<p>the radiation.

<p>196 11 Gaussian Waves and Open Resonators
</p>
<p>The wavelength of a monochromatic Gaussian wave is a constant far outside the
</p>
<p>beam waist but shows a (small) variation in the range of the waist. As a consequence,
</p>
<p>the resonance frequencies of a resonator with spherical mirrors are not multiples
</p>
<p>of a minimum frequency but are shifted toward higher frequencies. The change of
</p>
<p>wavelength in a beam waist corresponds to a change of phase that has been pre-
</p>
<p>dicted and experimentally demonstrated by L. G. Gouy in 1891 and experimentally
</p>
<p>demonstrated also recently by the use of femtosecond pulses. The Gouy phase shift
</p>
<p>influences the frequency spectrum of optical frequency combs (Sect. 13.4).
</p>
<p>We begin this chapter with a characterization of laser radiation generated by the
</p>
<p>use of a resonator with spherical mirrors.
</p>
<p>11.1 Open Resonator
</p>
<p>Figure 11.1a shows a design of a laser (e.g., of a titanium-sapphire laser). The laser
</p>
<p>resonator consists of spherical mirrors (diameter 1 cm) at a distance of 1 m. The active
</p>
<p>medium has a diameter of 1 cm. The diameter of the laser wave is about 1 mm. The
</p>
<p>spherical mirrors have the extraordinary property to concentrate the radiation within
</p>
<p>the resonator at the resonator axis. The radiation circulates within the resonator. A
</p>
<p>portion of radiation, coupled out via the partial reflector, has a small beam divergence

<p>11.1 Open Resonator 197
</p>
<p>(e.g., 1 mrad). Diffraction of the wave at the reflector and the partial mirror has (in
</p>
<p>the laser design shown in the figure) almost no effect on the wave&mdash;except that
</p>
<p>diffraction plays an important role with respect to elimination of radiation belonging
</p>
<p>to unwanted modes (Sect. 12.2).
</p>
<p>We give here a short characterization of a spherical-mirror resonator: it is an
</p>
<p>open resonator&mdash;it has no sidewalls (Fig. 11.1b). The length L of the resonator is
</p>
<p>much larger than the wavelength of the radiation. We characterize the modes of the
</p>
<p>resonator by the use of a cartesian coordinate system; we choose the direction of the
</p>
<p>resonator axis as z axis. We now blow up the lateral extension of the wave in order
</p>
<p>to visualize different modes. The simplest type is a longitudinal mode (Fig. 11.1c).
</p>
<p>The phase of the field varies along the resonator axis. The field amplitude has the
</p>
<p>largest value on the resonator axis and decreases in directions perpendicular to the
</p>
<p>resonator axis. Figure 11.1d shows a transverse mode: the phase of the field varies
</p>
<p>in axial direction (as for a longitudinal mode); however, the amplitude of the field is
</p>
<p>zero at the resonator axis and changes the sign in x direction. There are many other
</p>
<p>types of transverse modes as we will see.
</p>
<p>We will show that longitudinal and transverse modes of a resonator with spherical
</p>
<p>mirrors correspond to standing waves in accord with the wave equation and with
</p>
<p>appropriate boundary conditions. A standing wave in a spherical-mirror resonator
</p>
<p>consists of two Gaussian waves propagating in +z and &minus;z direction. The waves are
Gaussian waves (=Gaussian beams). Before treating resonators, we will introduce
Gaussian waves as solutions of the wave equation describing electromagnetic waves
</p>
<p>in free space (see the next two sections). A Gaussian wave is a paraxial wave: it has
</p>
<p>a well-defined propagation direction and a small beam divergence. We will see that
</p>
<p>Gaussian waves in free space can also be divided into longitudinal and transverse
</p>
<p>modes. A Gaussian (or higher-order Gaussian) mode of the free space is characterized
</p>
<p>by the propagation direction (z direction) and a number pair mn, where m is the
</p>
<p>number of changes of the sign of the amplitude in x direction and n is the number
</p>
<p>of changes in y direction.
</p>
<p>The electric field of a Gaussian wave in free space is transverse or nearly transverse
</p>
<p>to the z direction. The direction of the magnetic field (that has always a direction
</p>
<p>perpendicular to the electric field) is also transverse or nearly transverse to the z
</p>
<p>direction. A Gaussian wave characterized as
</p>
<p>TEMmn wave
</p>
<p>means that the electric and magnetic fields of the wave are transverse or nearly
</p>
<p>transverse to the z direction (Problem 11.6). A TEMmn wave can be a longitudinal
</p>
<p>or a transverse mode.
</p>
<p>&bull; Longitudinal mode=00 mode=axial mode=Gaussian mode= fundamental
Gaussian mode= lowest-order Gaussian mode&mdash;the longitudinal mode appears
under different names which will become clear during this chapter. The phase
</p>
<p>of the field in a longitudinal mode varies in the axial (=longitudinal) direction.
The sign of the amplitude does not change in the directions perpendicular to the
</p>
<p>resonator axis.</p>

<p>198 11 Gaussian Waves and Open Resonators
</p>
<p>&bull; Transverse mode (=higher-order Gaussian mode). The phase of a transverse mode
varies in the axial direction and the sign of the amplitude varies in one or two
</p>
<p>directions perpendicular to the resonator axis. We will introduce the Hermite&ndash;
</p>
<p>Gaussian modes.
</p>
<p>Paraxial electromagnetic waves are transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves
</p>
<p>(=transversely polarized electromagnetic waves), whether they belong to longitudi-
nal or transverse modes. The active medium of a laser resonator is able to excite a
</p>
<p>standing Gaussian mode in the resonator and&mdash;if one of the spherical mirrors is a
</p>
<p>partial mirror&mdash;also a Gaussian wave propagating in free space.
</p>
<p>A Gaussian mode or a higher-order Gaussian mode within a resonator is a
</p>
<p>TEMmnl mode.
</p>
<p>The index l indicates the number of half wavelengths of the field in a resonator.
</p>
<p>The electric and magnetic fields of a Gaussian wave in a resonator are transverse or
</p>
<p>nearly transverse to the z direction. Each number triple corresponds to a mode of the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic field, i.e., to a particular pattern of the field in a resonator.
</p>
<p>A polarized electromagnetic wave in a mode mn of free space or on a mode mnl
</p>
<p>of a resonator can be polarized in one of two directions perpendicular to each other
</p>
<p>(and perpendicular to the propagation direction). The direction of the polarization of
</p>
<p>laser radiation can be chosen by inserting a polarizer or other elements (for instance,
</p>
<p>a Brewster window) into the laser resonator.
</p>
<p>The characterization of modes as longitudinal or transverse modes is of practical
</p>
<p>interest: most lasers generate radiation belonging mainly to longitudinal modes.
</p>
<p>11.2 Helmholtz Equation
</p>
<p>We make use of a simple wave optics, first described by Helmholtz. We start with
</p>
<p>the equation
</p>
<p>&nabla;2 E &minus;
1
</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>&part;2 E
</p>
<p>&part;t2
= 0, (11.1)
</p>
<p>which represents three wave equations, one for each of the three components of the
</p>
<p>field vector E. Ignoring the polarization of the electric field, we can reduce the three
</p>
<p>wave equations to one equation,
</p>
<p>&nabla;2E &minus;
1
</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>&part;2E
</p>
<p>&part;t2
= 0. (11.2)
</p>
<p>E is the field treated as a scalar quantity. We consider a monochromatic wave
</p>
<p>E(x, y, z, t) = ψ(x, y, z) eiωt . (11.3)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.2 Helmholtz Equation 199
</p>
<p>The time independent part of the field, ψ(x, y, z), obeys the Helmholtz equation
</p>
<p>&nabla;2ψ + k2ψ = 0, (11.4)
</p>
<p>where k = ω/c. The energy density of the field is u(x, y, z) = 1
2
ε0|ψ(x, y, z)|2.
</p>
<p>Among the many solutions of the Helmholtz equation are two simple cases.
</p>
<p>Plane wave. The solution is
</p>
<p>E = A ei(ωt&minus;kz), (11.5)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>k = ω/c (11.6)
</p>
<p>is the wave vector and c the speed of light. The wave vector is independent of x , y,
</p>
<p>and z. The phase of the wave assumes constant values,
</p>
<p>ϕ(t, z) = ωt &minus; kz = const. (11.7)
</p>
<p>The condition &part;ϕ/&part;t=0 yields the phase velocity vph =dz/dt= ω/k= c. The
condition &part;ϕ/&part;z=0 yields the group velocity vg = dz/dt= c. Group and phase
velocities are equal to the speed of light. The wavelength λ=2π/k, i.e., the spatial
period, is independent of x, y, and z. The amplitude A of a plane wave is the same
</p>
<p>everywhere in space. The phase kz is a constant in planes of fixed z.
</p>
<p>The wave has no angular spread. We can decompose the phase,
</p>
<p>ϕ(t, z) = ϕt (t)&minus; ϕz(z), (11.8)
</p>
<p>where ϕt (t) is the time-dependent portion of the phase and ϕz(z) is the position-
</p>
<p>dependent portion. The temporal change of ϕt (t) is the angular frequency,
</p>
<p>dϕt/dt = ω, (11.9)
</p>
<p>and spatial change of ϕz(z) is the wave vector (=2π&times; saptial frequency),
</p>
<p>dϕz/dz = k. (11.10)
</p>
<p>Spherical wave. A spherical wave has the form
</p>
<p>E =
K
</p>
<p>s
ei(ωt&minus;ks). (11.11)
</p>
<p>K is a measure of the strength of a wave. Inserting (11.11) in (11.4) yields k=ω/c.
The amplitude decreases inversely proportional to the distance s from a point source.
</p>
<p>The phase ks is a constant on spheres around the origin s=0. The phase and group
</p>
<p>velocities are equal to the speed of light. The direction of the phase and of the group</p>

<p>200 11 Gaussian Waves and Open Resonators
</p>
<p>velocity is radial away from the source point s=0. The wavelength λ=2π/k is
independent of x, y, and z.
</p>
<p>The plane wave and the spherical wave cannot be realized experimentally. We
</p>
<p>will now look for paraxial waves. These have a well-defined propagation direction
</p>
<p>(along z) and a small angular spread. We describe the waves by the ansatz
</p>
<p>ψ = f (x, y, z) e&minus;ikz . (11.12)
</p>
<p>We suppose that f changes only weakly with z. We can therefore neglect the second
</p>
<p>derivative of f with respect to z and obtain the Helmholtz equation of paraxial waves,
</p>
<p>&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;x2
+
</p>
<p>&part;2 f
</p>
<p>&part;y2
&minus; 2ik
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;z
= 0. (11.13)
</p>
<p>Gaussian waves and waves in optical resonators are described in many textbooks;
</p>
<p>see REFERENCES at the end of the chapter. Studies of mode patterns began in 1961
</p>
<p>[67&ndash;69]. We will study various aspects of Gaussian waves. We will begin with the
</p>
<p>discussion of a solution of the Helmholtz equation, following [40].
</p>
<p>11.3 Gaussian Wave
</p>
<p>A Gaussian wave (=Gaussian beam) is a paraxial wave. We solve the Helmholtz
equation of paraxial waves by use of the ansatz
</p>
<p>f (x, y, z) = G(z) e&minus;(x2+y2)/F(z). (11.14)

<p>G and F are complex functions that change only weakly with z.

<p>The integration constant C1 is a complex quantity. We suppose that the wave front

<p>Is it possible to realize a Gaussian wave? The answer is: a laser with appropriately

<p>A confocal resonator consists of two spherical mirrors, which have the same focus.
</p>
<p>We discuss the symmetric confocal resonator. It has two equal mirrors.
</p>
<p>Two spherical mirrors arranged at a distance L=R form a (symmetric) confocal
</p>
<p>resonator (Fig. 11.4, left). We choose z=0 as the location of the center of one of
</p>
<p>the mirrors. We will show that a Gaussian wave can fit to a confocal resonator. The
</p>
<p>symmetry of the arrangement requires that the beam waist lies at z0 = L/2. We choose

<p>zR = L/2 and obtain, by using (11.49) and (11.50), the radius of curvature</p>

<p>the cross sectional area of the beam waist (with respect to the energy distribution)
</p>
<p>and the length of the resonator. Table 11.2 shows values of beam waists and mode
</p>
<p>volumes for radiation of a fixed wavelength.
</p>
<p>The confocal resonator is suitable as resonator of, for instance, a helium&ndash;neon
</p>
<p>laser or a free-electron laser.
</p>
<p>&bull; Helium&ndash;neon laser (λ= 633 nm). The small gain of the active medium requires a
large length (typically 0.5 m) of the resonator. The mechanism of the relaxation
</p>
<p>of the excited neon atoms makes it necessary to use a tube with a small diameter;
</p>
<p>the neon atoms relax by collisions with the walls (Sect. 14.3).
</p>
<p>&bull; Free-electron laser. A free-electron laser requires a resonator of a length of typ-
ically 10 m. The Gaussian wave in a confocal resonator has a large overlap with
</p>
<p>an electron wave that propagates along the axis of the resonator (Sect. 19.1).
</p>
<p>Other resonator configurations will be discussed in the next section.
</p>
<p>11.5 Stability of a Field in a Resonator
</p>
<p>There are a large number of different resonators. However, not all have stable modes.
</p>
<p>We treat a resonator with two spherical mirrors (Fig. 11.6) that have different radii (R1
and R2) of curvature. A Gaussian mode, fitting to the resonator, can be determined</p>

<p>The different types of resonators (Fig. 11.8) have advantages and disadvantages.
</p>
<p>&bull; The confocal resonator. It has the lowest diffraction loss (Sect. 11.8). Correspond-
ing to the stability criterion, the confocal resonator is at the limit of stability. To
</p>
<p>reach stability, the distance between the mirrors should be slightly smaller than
</p>
<p>the radius of curvature of the mirrors. In comparison with other resonators, this
</p>
<p>resonator can easily be adjusted.
</p>
<p>&bull; A semiconfocal resonator consists of a spherical mirror and a plane mirror at the
distance R/2, where R is the radius of curvature of the spherical mirror&mdash;the plane
</p>
<p>mirror is located at the position of the beam waist of a corresponding confocal
</p>
<p>resonator.
</p>
<p>&bull; The concentric resonator (=spherical resonator) has a beam waist of w0 = 0 and
an infinitely large divergence. It is therefore not realizable.

<p>This is an important result: the Gouy phase shift of radiation propagating within a

<p>frequencies. The shift is the same for all resonance frequencies. But the frequency dis-
</p>
<p>tance between neighboring resonances remains uninfluenced by the Gouy phase shift.
</p>
<p>Figure 11.9 shows the frequencies of the modes of different resonators. The Gouy

<p>frequency is zero for a Fabry-Perot resonator, c/4L for a symmetric confocal res-
</p>

<p>11.7 The Gouy Phase 221
</p>
<p>The Gouy phase shift at a transit of radiation through the beam waist, from a far-
</p>
<p>field location to a location in the other far-field is equal to &minus;π . In the range of the
beam waist, the effective wavelength (Fig. 11.12, lower panels) is larger than λ. In
</p>
<p>the center of the beam waist, the effective wavelength is equal to λeff = λ+ λ/(4π).
The wave fronts have the largest distance in the center of the beam waist. The sum
</p>
<p>of all differences λeff &minus; λ at a transit of radiation through the beam waist is equal to
λ/2.
</p>
<p>We now discuss the Gouy phase shift of radiation in a resonator. The field of a
</p>
<p>standing wave of an open resonator is
</p>
<p>E(z, r, t) = A0

<p>w
e&minus;r
</p>
<p>2/w2 cos[k(z &minus; z0)&minus; φ + kr2/2R] cosωt. (11.124)

<p>The resonance condition requires that
</p>
<p>2kL &minus;∆φ = l &times; 2π; l = 1, 2, ..., (11.125)
</p>
<p>where l is the order of resonance and ∆φ the Gouy phase shift per round trip. At
</p>
<p>resonance, the phase change 2kL per round trip transit is larger than 2π because of
</p>
<p>the Gouy phase shift,
</p>
<p>2kL = l &times; 2π +∆φ. (11.126)
</p>
<p>It follows that the resonance frequencies are
</p>
<p>νl = l &times;
c

<p>2L

</p>
<p>Example The Gouy phase shift of a symmetric confocal resonator of a length of 0.5 m
</p>
<p>is ∆φ = π and the Gouy frequency is 0.5c/(2L)=150 MHz; for a semiconfocal
resonator of the same length, the Gouy phase shift is π/2 and the Gouy frequency is
</p>
<p>75 MHz.
</p>
<p>In 1891, Louis Gouy (Lyon, France) found that an electromagnetic wave changes
</p>
<p>the phase by π if it propagates through a focus point&mdash;besides the phase change due
</p>
<p>to spatial propagation [70&ndash;72]. Gouy studied an interference pattern of two beams
</p>
<p>(arising from the same white light source), which were reflected from two plane
</p>
<p>mirrors, and observed an additional phase shift when he replaced one of the mirrors
</p>
<p>by a spherical mirror that produced a focus point in one of the beams; Gouy derived
</p>
<p>the phase shift from an analysis of the focusing process by use of Huygens&rsquo; principle.
</p>
<p>Various studies in the years shortly after 1900 confirmed the results (see [73]).
</p>
<p>The Gouy phase shift has also been observed by means of coherent waves&mdash;
</p>
<p>waves with well-defined amplitudes and phases. Experiments have been performed
</p>
<p>with microwaves [74], near infrared radiation [75] and far infrared radiation [76]. We
</p>
<p>describe the far infrared experiment (Fig. 11.15). The radiation consisted of single-
</p>
<p>cycle terahertz radiation wave packet, generated with a small-area source. The radi-
</p>
<p>ation was made parallel with a lens and focused with another lens to a small-area
</p>
<p>detector. The detector monitored the time dependent amplitude and phase of the radi-
</p>
<p>ation at the position of the detector. Alternatively, two additional lenses produced</p>

<p>a focus point between source and detector. Signals were measured at different time
</p>
<p>delays relative to the starting time of a pulse. The experiment showed that the phase
</p>
<p>of a wave packet changed by π when the wave propagated through the focus; we will
</p>
<p>describe the method of measuring phases and amplitudes of electromagnetic fields
</p>
<p>in Sect. 13.5.
</p>
<p>We can ask: is the group velocity of radiation traversing a beam waist smaller than
</p>
<p>the speed of light? The answer is no: the change of phase by π causes a reversal of
</p>
<p>the direction of the electric field of the wave. The group velocity remains therefore
</p>
<p>unchanged.
</p>
<p>11.8 Diffraction Loss
</p>
<p>Up to now, we have neglected loss by diffraction at the resonator mirrors. The dif-
</p>
<p>fraction loss depends on the resonator type. Figure 11.16 shows examples of the
</p>
<p>diffraction loss δ (=loss per round trip) for resonators of different Fresnel num-
bers (F).
</p>
<p>&bull; The diffraction loss of radiation in a confocal resonator is (for F &ge; 0.5) much
smaller than the diffraction loss of radiation in a planar resonator.
</p>
<p>&bull; Longitudinal modes have a smaller diffraction loss than transverse modes.
&bull; The diffraction loss decreases strongly with increasing Fresnel number.
</p>
<p>The theory of Kirchhoff (1882) allows for determination of diffraction loss. We give
</p>
<p>here a short sketch of the theory. We are looking for a solution of the wave equation
</p>
<p>in the form of the Helmholtz equation,
</p>
<p>&nabla;2ψ + k2ψ = 0. (11.129)
</p>
<p>Originally, Kirchhoff formulated the theory assuming that a parallel light wave is
</p>
<p>incident on an iris diaphragm (Fig. 11.17a). The boundary condition is the following:
</p>
<p>in the open part of the iris, the field has the same valueψ as without iris. According to
</p>
<p>Huygens&rsquo; principle, spherical waves are leaving from each point in the open part of</p>

<p>the iris. The field amplitude at a point (x2, y2) is the sum of all partial waves arriving

</p>

</p>
<p>The amplitude depends on the distance s between the iris and the point (x2, y2) and on
</p>
<p>the angle θ between the central axis and the direction between the iris and the point;
</p>
<p>s is large compared to the diameter of the open part of the iris. The solution obeys
</p>
<p>the Helmholtz equation. The factor i to the integral (11.130) implies the occurrence
</p>
<p>of the Gouy phase shift.
</p>
<p>Radiation in a resonator undergoes multiple reflection with diffraction, illustrated
</p>
<p>in Fig. 11.17b for iris diaphragms in series. The calculation starts with an arbitrarily
</p>
<p>assumed field distribution ψ1(x1, x2), for instance, a constant distribution over one</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.8 Diffraction Loss 225
</p>
<p>of the mirrors. A first integration provides the distribution at the second mirror&mdash;at
</p>
<p>a single transit through the resonator. The numerical calculation of ψn+1 from ψn ,
where n is the number of passes through the resonator, leads to the following results.
</p>
<p>&bull; Stable resonator. After a field has performed a certain number of transits through
the resonator, the field obeys the relation
</p>
<p>ψn+1(x, y) = η ψn(x, y), (11.131)
</p>
<p>where η (&lt; 1) is a number. The shape of the field distribution is reproduced, but
</p>
<p>there is a loss at each reflection.
</p>
<p>&bull; Instable resonator. The distribution ψ(x, y) does not stabilize.
</p>
<p>We have seen that in the far field of a fundamental Gaussian wave the product of
</p>
<p>the beam diameter and the angle of aperture is a constant,
</p>
<p>D0 &times; θ0 =
4
</p>
<p>π
λ. (11.132)
</p>
<p>D0=2w0 is the diameter of the field distribution at the beam waist. If diffraction at
</p>
<p>the output coupling mirror or at another optical element in a laser resonator enhances
</p>
<p>the angle of aperture, the beam diameter D can be larger than D0 and the angle θ
</p>
<p>can be larger than θ0. The product can be written as
</p>
<p>D &times; θ = M2D0θ0. (11.133)
</p>
<p>The M factor is a measure of the quality of a beam. M = 1 corresponds to a Gaussian
beam.

<p>where r is the distance of the ray from the beam axis and r &prime; = dr/dz is the slope of
the ray. The slope of a paraxial ray is approximately equal to the angle between the
</p>
<p>ray and the optical axis. Therefore, we can make use of the approximation dr/dz =
sin α &asymp; α.

</p>
<p>lens with the focus length 2 f1=R1, a lens with the focus length f2 = R2/2 and
another half lens with the focus length 2 f1 = R1. A round trip through the resonator
corresponds to the path through the periodicity interval in the lens system from r1

<p>Different Ways of Operating a Laser
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we describe techniques used to operate lasers as continuous wave
</p>
<p>lasers or as pulsed lasers&mdash;in the next chapter we will treat femtosecond lasers.
</p>
<p>We discuss single mode lasers. We mention spectral hole burning, occurring in
</p>
<p>lasers that operate with inhomogeneously broadened transitions. We give a short
</p>
<p>introduction to variousmethods ofQ-switching of lasers used to generate laser pulses.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we describe two applications of continuous wave lasers&mdash;optical
</p>
<p>tweezers and gravitational wave detector.
</p>
<p>12.1 Possibilities of Operating a Laser
</p>
<p>Lasers can operate as continuous wave lasers, as pulsed lasers, or as femtosecond
</p>
<p>lasers. Lasers operated in different ways at different wavelengths have various appli-
</p>
<p>cations in physics, chemistry [77, 78], biology, andmedicine [79&ndash;82, 127&ndash;129, 332].
</p>
<p>An early application was the holography [83, 84].
</p>
<p>There are continuous wave lasers and different types of pulsed lasers:
</p>
<p>&bull; The cw (continuous wave) laser. Continuous pumping maintains the laser oscilla-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>&bull; Pulsed laser. A pump pulse generates a population inversion. Or more general:
</p>
<p>each laser that delivers pulses is a pulsed laser.
</p>
<p>&bull; Q-switched laser. In theQ-switched laser, the quality factorQ of the laser resonator
</p>
<p>varies with time. The Q factor is small for most of the time and large for a short
</p>
<p>time. During the time of small Q, population in the upper laser level is collected.
</p>
<p>During the time of large Q, laser oscillation occurs and the population of the upper
</p>
<p>laser level is strongly reduced.

</p>
<p>&bull; Giant pulse laser. This is a Q-switched laser with an upper laser level that has a
</p>
<p>very long lifetime (for instance 1ms); pumping leads to a large concentration of
</p>
<p>atoms in the upper laser level.
</p>
<p>&bull; Femtosecond laser (Chap. 13). The pumping is continuous. For most of the time,
</p>
<p>the Q factor of the resonator is small but it is large during short time intervals that
</p>
<p>follow each other periodically. The laser emits a coherent pulse train.
</p>
<p>12.2 Operation of a Laser on Longitudinal Modes
</p>
<p>A mode diaphragm eliminates transverse modes. The transverse modes suffer
</p>
<p>stronger diffraction than longitudinal modes and cannot reach the threshold condi-
</p>
<p>tion. This mode selection makes it possible to operate a laser on longitudinal modes,
</p>
<p>00l, 00(1+1), . . . .
</p>
<p>There are different possibilities of the operation of a laser on longitudinal modes:
</p>
<p>&bull; Single line laser, operated on a few neighboring longitudinal modes at frequencies
</p>
<p>in a narrow frequency range.
</p>
<p>&bull; Single mode laser, operated on a single longitudinal mode.
</p>
<p>&bull; Mode-locked laser, operated on a large number of longitudinal modes with fre-
</p>
<p>quencies in a large frequency range&mdash;the phases of the electromagnetic fields of
</p>
<p>different longitudinal modes are coupled (locked) to each other (Chap. 13).
</p>
<p>12.3 Single Mode Laser
</p>
<p>Many lasers (e.g., the helium&ndash;neon laser) have narrow gain profiles, but oscillate
</p>
<p>on a few modes (Fig. 12.1). By inserting an etalon (a plane parallel plate) into
</p>
<p>the resonator, selection of a single mode is possible. An etalon represents a low-Q
</p>
<p>resonator of the resonance wavelength
</p>
<p>λs =
2nd
</p>
<p>s
cos θ, (12.1)
</p>
<p>where n is the refractive index, d the thickness of the etalon, and θ the angle between
</p>
<p>the laser beam within the etalon and the normal to the etalon; s (an integer) is the
</p>
<p>order of resonance. Rotation of the etalon changes the angle θ and the resonance
</p>
<p>wavelength λs .
</p>
<p>Example Without an etalon in the resonator, a helium&ndash;neon laser oscillates on about
</p>
<p>three modes at once (Fig. 12.1, lower part) but with an etalon on a single mode.</p>

</p>
<p>633 nm, ν = 474 THz)
</p>
<p>12.4 Tunable Laser
</p>
<p>A laser with a broadband gain profile oscillates on a single line if the laser resonator
</p>
<p>contains an appropriate wavelength selective element. We mention three wavelength
</p>
<p>selective elements suited to force a laser with a broad gain profile to emit a single
</p>
<p>line.
</p>
<p>&bull; Prism (Fig. 12.2a). A prism in the resonator selects the laser wavelength. The
</p>
<p>laser is tunable; rotation of the prism changes the wavelength. With an etalon
</p>
<p>additionally inserted into the resonator, a laser is able to oscillate on a single
</p>
<p>mode.
</p>
<p>&bull; Echelette grating (Fig. 12.2b). An echelette grating acts as one of the two reflectors
</p>
<p>of a laser resonator. In the Littrow arrangement, radiation that is incident on the
</p>
<p>echelette grating is diffracted in first order. The diffracted beam has the reverse
</p>
<p>direction relative to the incident beam. A rotation of the grating changes the wave-
</p>
<p>length of the backward diffracted radiation and thus the laser wavelength. Amirror
</p>
<p>telescope extends the diameter of the beam in order to obtain a higher resolving
</p>
<p>power and, furthermore, to reduce the field strength at the surface of the echelette
</p>
<p>grating thus avoiding damage of the grating. With an etalon that is additionally
</p>
<p>inserted into the resonator, a laser is able to oscillate on a single mode.
</p>
<p>&bull; Birefringent filter (Fig. 12.2c). The frequency selective element is a birefringent
</p>
<p>plate (e.g., a crystal of KDP= potassium dihydrogen phosphate) located between
</p>
<p>two polarizers in the laser resonator. The optic axis of the birefringent plate is
</p>
<p>oriented along the surface of the plate. The birefringent plate splits a beam of
</p>
<p>polarized radiation, incident under the Brewster angle, into an ordinary and an
</p>
<p>extraordinary beam. Behind the plate, the radiation has elliptical polarization and</p>

<p>the second polarizer causes loss. There is no loss if the change of the phase between
</p>
<p>the ordinary and extraordinary beam is a multiple of π ,

<p>2π
</p>
<p>λ
(ne &minus; no)lp = s &times; π, (12.2)
</p>
<p>where ne is the refractive index of the extraordinary beam, no the refractive index
</p>
<p>of the ordinary beam, lp the length of the plate along the beam direction, and s is an
</p>
<p>integer. By rotating the plate while keeping the angle of incidence at the Brewster
</p>
<p>angle, the direction of the optic axis relative to the direction of the electric field vector
</p>
<p>(E) changes, leading to changes of ne and of λ.
</p>
<p>12.5 Spectral Hole Burning in Lasers Using
</p>
<p>Inhomogeneously Broadened Transitions
</p>
<p>The oscillation behavior of a continuous wave laser depends on the type of line
</p>
<p>broadening.
</p>
<p>A cw laser based on a homogeneously broadened line oscillates at the frequency of
</p>
<p>maximum gain (Fig. 12.3). When the population inversion begins, laser oscillation at
</p>
<p>the line center&mdash;where the gain coefficient α has its maximum&mdash;builds up. The onset
</p>
<p>of laser oscillation leads to a reduction of the population difference, from (N2 &minus; N1)0
to (N2 &minus; N1)th for frequencies at the line center. Accordingly, the gain coefficient</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 12.3 Continuous wave laser based on a homogeneously broadened transition (upper part) or
</p>
<p>an inhomogeneously broadened transition (lower part)
</p>
<p>changes from the small-signal gain coefficient to the threshold gain coefficient αth for
</p>
<p>frequencies at the line center. Then the population difference and the gain coefficient
</p>
<p>are not sufficient for laser oscillation at frequencies in the wings of the line.
</p>
<p>Examples of continuous wave lasers based on transitions with homogeneous line
</p>
<p>broadening: Nd:YAG laser; titanium&ndash;sapphire laser.
</p>
<p>If laser oscillation is based on an inhomogeneously broadened line, a cw laser can
</p>
<p>oscillate on all modes that reach the threshold gain. Laser oscillation on one mode
</p>
<p>does not directly influence the population of two-level atomic systems that contribute
</p>
<p>to oscillation on other modes.
</p>
<p>Examples of lasers based on transitions with inhomogeneous broadening: helium&ndash;
</p>
<p>neon laser; cw CO2 laser.
</p>
<p>The gain curve α(v) of a laser operated with an inhomogeneous broadened line
</p>
<p>shows &lsquo;holes&rdquo; (see Fig. 12.3)&mdash;the effect is a manifestation of spectral hole burning.
</p>
<p>Irradiation of a medium with laser radiation can lead to a hole in the absorption
</p>
<p>spectrum of a medium. (Generation of a spectral hole in a medium by using a pulsed
</p>
<p>laser and the probing of the spectrum with cw radiation or with probe pulses allows
</p>
<p>for the measurement of the lifetime of a spectral hole; different methods of spectral
</p>
<p>hole burning arewidely used in physics and chemistry for studying spectral properties
</p>
<p>of various media.)
</p>
<p>12.6 Q-Switched Lasers
</p>
<p>We discuss a few methods of Q-switching.
</p>
<p>&bull; Mechanical Q-switching (Fig. 12.4a). The reflector of the laser resonator rotates
</p>
<p>(for example with an angular frequency of 100 turns per second). The resonator
</p>
<p>has a high Q factor only during a short time in which the rotating mirror is oriented
</p>
<p>parallel to the output coupling mirror. During the time of a low Q factor, the upper
</p>
<p>laser level is populated and during the time of large Q, it is depopulated.</p>

<p>cell switches the Q factor of the laser resonator from a low to a high value. An
</p>
<p>optically isotropic crystal becomes birefringent when a static voltage (U ) across
</p>
<p>the crystal is applied and produces a static field Es in the crystal. Then the refractive
</p>
<p>indices for a light field E are different for the polarization directions parallel and

<p>perpendicular to the static field. The difference of the refractive indices is given by
</p>
<p>n(E||Es)&minus; n(E&perp;Es) = aU, (12.3)
</p>
<p>where a is a material constant. A Pockels cell with applied voltage rotates the
</p>
<p>polarization direction of the light after two transits through the cell by π/2. A
</p>
<p>polarizer blocks the radiation. When the voltage is quickly turned off, the crystal
</p>
<p>is no longer blocking the radiation&mdash;a laser pulse builds up in the resonator. The
</p>
<p>Pockels effect is large for KDP (for a specific crystal orientation). A voltage of

<p>about 25kV is necessary for Q-switching with a crystal of 5mm height and 5 cm

<p>are a singlet state (S1) and a triplet state (T), at a smaller energy.By transitionsS0 &rarr;
</p>
<p>S1, laser radiation is absorbed and by nonradiative transitions S1 &rarr; T, molecules
</p>
<p>are transferred into the triplet state. A triplet state has a long lifetime (0.1&ndash;1&micro; s);
</p>
<p>the decay of a triplet state occursmainly via nonradiative transitions. AQ-switched
</p>
<p>laser based on a saturable absorber (Fig. 12.5b) is continuously pumped.At the start
</p>
<p>of the pumping, a laser field begins to build up. The buildup of a laser field occurs
</p>
<p>slowly because of absorption of radiation by the dye molecules. The absorption
</p>
<p>saturates the dye molecules, then almost all dye molecules are in the triplet state
</p>
<p>and the dye cell becomes transparent giving rise to generation of a strong laser
</p>
<p>pulse (Fig. 12.5c). During the buildup of a pulse, the population of the upper laser
</p>
<p>level becomes reduced to a low value. Due to relaxation of the dye molecules to
</p>
<p>their ground state, absorption sets in and the Q value becomes small. The buildup
</p>
<p>of a laser field begins again. Pumping is possible with radiation of another laser.

<p>242 12 Different Ways of Operating a Laser
</p>
<p>12.8 An Application of CW Lasers: The Optical Tweezers
</p>
<p>The optical tweezers are suitable for optical trapping of single biomolecules solved
</p>
<p>or suspended in a liquid. The optical tweezers have many applications especially in
</p>
<p>biology and chemistry.
</p>
<p>&bull; Biology. Spectroscopy of trapped single molecules (e.g., red blood cells); study of
</p>
<p>properties of DNA; sorting of cells.
</p>
<p>&bull; Chemistry. Spectroscopy of trapped single organic macromolecules.
</p>
<p>Figure 12.6a illustrates the principle of the optical tweezers. A glass pearl (diam-
</p>
<p>eter 1&ndash;10&micro;m), which is transparent for light, is trapped in the focus of a laser beam.
</p>
<p>The beam (power&sim; 1 mW) is strongly focused. When the glass pearl has a position
</p>
<p>below the focus, the pearl acts as a lens and the light leaves the pearl at an angle of
</p>
<p>aperture that is smaller than the angle under which it enters the pearl. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>the light gains momentum in the direction of the light beam, namely downward, and
</p>
<p>therefore the pearl gains momentum toward the focus.When the pearl has a position
</p>
<p>above the focus, it acts as a diverging lens and the force on the pearl is downward.
</p>
<p>The light leaves the pearl under the same angular distribution as it enters the pearl
</p>
<p>and there is no momentum transfer. When the glass pearl is located at the height of
</p>
<p>the focus but shifted to the left, the light beam is deflected to the left and the pearl
</p>
<p>moves toward the focus. Finally, when the pearl is on the right side of the focus,
</p>
<p>there is a force toward the left. Thus, the stable location of the pearl is the focus of
</p>
<p>the lens.

<p>12.8 An Application of CW Lasers: The Optical Tweezers 243
</p>
<p>An optical tweezers system can be realized as amodifiedmicroscope (Fig. 12.6b).
</p>
<p>The object lens produces a strongly focused beam of laser radiation. A camera mon-
</p>
<p>itors reflected radiation. The optical tweezers are able to trap a macromolecule in a
</p>
<p>solvent. Investigation of a trapped molecule is possible by using spectroscopic tech-
</p>
<p>niques, e.g., by studyingfluorescence radiation.Applications in biology are described
</p>
<p>in [79].
</p>
<p>12.9 Another Application: Gravitational Wave Detector
</p>
<p>An extraordinary ambitious project concerns the goal to detect gravitational waves
</p>
<p>(see, for instance, [85]). The collapse of a big star generates (according to the general
</p>
<p>theory of gravitation) a gravitational wave, propagating with the speed of light. The
</p>
<p>wavelength of a gravitational wave is of the order of the extension of the collapsing
</p>
<p>star. A gravitational wave is expected to compress the space in a direction perpen-
</p>
<p>dicular to the propagation direction and to dilate the space in the other direction
</p>
<p>perpendicular to the propagation direction. At present, gravitational wave detectors
</p>
<p>based on the Michelson interferometer are built and tested at many places.
</p>
<p>The center of the gravitational wave detector (Fig. 12.7) is a Michelson interfer-
</p>
<p>ometerwith a laser light source. TheMichelson interferometer has two arms arranged
</p>
<p>perpendicular to each other. A beam splitter divides the laser beam into two beams.
</p>
<p>A gravitational wave pulse traversing the Michelson interferometer is expected to
</p>
<p>shorten one arm and to lengthen the other arm. Estimates of the effect suggest that the
</p>
<p>path length difference may only be of the order of 10&minus;22 m for L1 = L2 = 1 km. The
</p>
<p>experiment requires an extremely high stability of the laser and of the arrangement
</p>
<p>and, furthermore, an extremely high sensitivity of detection. To have a chance to
</p>
<p>observe a signal, the arms have to be very long (of the order of 1 km or much longer).
</p>
<p>Making use of satellites, very large arms are realizable. The arms have slightly dif-
</p>
<p>ferent lengths (L1 &minus; L2 = λ/4, where λ is the wavelength of the laser radiation) in
</p>
<p>order to have a high sensitivity of detection.
</p>
<p>In 2016, observation of a gravitational wave has been reported [311].

<p>Femtosecond Laser
</p>
<p>Mode locking allows a laser with a broad gain bandwidth to generate femtosecond
</p>
<p>pulses. A mode-locked laser oscillates at the same time on a large number of modes.
</p>
<p>The fields of all modes are phase-locked to each other.
</p>
<p>We describe the principle of mode locking, techniques of mode locking, and
</p>
<p>a method of determination of the duration of femtosecond pulses. We explain the
</p>
<p>pump-probe method, which is suited to take ultrashort snapshots during dynamical
</p>
<p>processes in an atomic system. Additionally, we study the onset of oscillation of a
</p>
<p>femtosecond laser.
</p>
<p>The femtosecond laser is the basis of a great variety of new areas of research
</p>
<p>and applications. We discuss: femto-chemistry; optical frequency analyzer; tera-
</p>
<p>hertz time domain spectrometer; and attosecond pulses&mdash;that is an area of nonlinear
</p>
<p>optics with very strong optical fields. Other applications concern surgery and material
</p>
<p>processing.
</p>
<p>An optical frequency analyzer makes use of an optical frequency comb.
</p>
<p>A titanium&ndash;sapphire laser generates a frequency comb with a frequency distribution
</p>
<p>that extends over about an octave. We show in this chapter that the exact position of
</p>
<p>the frequencies of a frequency comb generated with a femtosecond laser are deter-
</p>
<p>mined by: the optical length of the resonator; the Gouy phase shift; dispersion of the
</p>
<p>active medium; and dispersion of the optical elements. Making use of methods of
</p>
<p>nonlinear optics, the distribution can be broadened&mdash;a frequency comb can consist of
</p>
<p>fields at equally spaced frequencies corresponding to radiation from the near infrared
</p>
<p>to the near ultraviolet. The position of the frequencies generated by a particular laser
</p>
<p>can be determined with a very high accuracy (Sect. 35.7).
</p>
<p>We will introduce (Sect. 13.1) the mode locking without taking account of Gouy
</p>
<p>phase shift and dispersion. In Sect. 13.4, we will discuss the role of the Gouy phase
</p>
<p>shift and of dispersion.

<p>246 13 Femtosecond Laser
</p>
<p>13.1 Mode Locking
</p>
<p>The secret of the femtosecond laser is the mode locking: the laser oscillates at the
</p>
<p>same time on a large number of longitudinal modes&mdash;with equal frequency separation
</p>
<p>between next-near modes&mdash;and all oscillations have fixed phases relative to each
</p>
<p>other.
</p>
<p>We choose an active medium with a broad gain coefficient profile (Fig. 13.1a)
</p>
<p>that has a Gaussian shape. The spectral profile F2(ω) for a particular femtosecond
</p>
<p>laser depends on parameters of the laser. For a first treatment of a femtosecond laser,
</p>
<p>we assume that the profile has a rectangular shape and that the width is equal to the
</p>
<p>gain bandwidth (Fig. 13.1b). Accordingly, the amplitude A of the field components
</p>
<p>is constant within the frequency range ω0 &minus;∆ωg/2, ω0 +∆ωg/2 and zero outside
</p>
<p>this range. The frequency distribution represents an optical frequency comb: the
</p>
<p>frequency distribution consists of equally spaced peaks. The frequency separation
</p>
<p>between next-near peaks is equal to
</p>
<p>Ω = 2π/T = 2πc/2L = πc/L , (13.1)
</p>
<p>where T = 2L/c is the round trip transit time. The number of modes with frequencies
</p>
<p>in the gain bandwidth ∆ωg is
</p>
<p>N = ∆ωg/Ω. (13.2)

</p>
<p>The mode locking corresponds to a synchronization of fields of different fre-

<p>quencies (belonging to different modes). The synchronization is possible because all
</p>
<p>frequencies are multiples of the same fundamental frequency Ω = 2π/T according
</p>
<p>to the resonance condition ωl = l &times;Ω; the phase of each field component has, after

</p>
<p>An active medium with a homogeneously broadened 2 &rarr; 1 fluorescence line

<p>is most favorable as an active medium of a mode locked laser. Then all excited

<p>Because of frequency dependent loss, which we describe by a loss coefficient
</p>
<p>β(ω), we obtain an effective gain curve
</p>
<p>αeff(ω) = α(ω)&minus; β(ω). (13.20)
</p>
<p>The optical properties of the coatings of the optical elements (including the res-
</p>
<p>onator mirrors) in the laser resonator depend on the wavelength. Therefore, also the
</p>
<p>loss factor depends on the wavelength. The gain medium together with the coatings
</p>
<p>determine the actual carrier frequency&mdash;the carrier frequency can be smaller or larger
</p>
<p>thanω0. Thus, the carrier frequency can be chosen by making use of appropriate opti-
</p>
<p>cal elements.
</p>
<p>Mode locking is possible by active mode locking or passive mode locking. We
</p>
<p>will describe techniques of mode locking in the next section.
</p>
<p>Before, we should mention that the field E(t) is the Fourier transform of the
</p>
<p>frequency spectrum F(ω) and vice versa:

</p>
<p>According to the gain bandwidth of titanium&ndash;sapphire, pulses with a pulse duration
</p>
<p>as short as &sim;4 fs should be attainable; pulses of a duration of &sim;5 fs have indeed been
</p>
<p>observed [87]. (Note: in comparison with a rectangular shape of the intensity profile,
</p>
<p>a Gaussian shape with the same gain bandwidth has a broader spectral distribution
</p>
<p>of the amplitudes and leads therefore to shorter pulses.)

<p>13.2 Active and Passive Mode Locking
</p>
<p>An acousto-optic modulator (Fig. 13.6a) is suitable for active mode locking. The
</p>
<p>switch consists of a periodically in time-varying diffraction grating. An ultrasonic
</p>
<p>wave in a crystal modulates spatially the mass density of the crystal and therefore the
</p>
<p>refractive index. Every half period of the ultrasonic field, the modulation disappears
</p>
<p>during a short moment. Therefore, there is no diffraction pattern for a short moment
</p>
<p>and a light pulse passes the modulator without diffraction loss. Laser pulses pass the
</p>
<p>modulator without diffraction at twice the ultrasonic frequency fs . The frequency of</p>

</p>
<p>the ultrasonic wave is 2 fs = 1/T . A laser of length 1.5 m, 1/T = c/2L = 10
8 Hz
</p>
<p>(100 MHz), requires an ultrasonic wave of a frequency of 50 MHz.
</p>
<p>Kerr lens mode locking is a method of passive mode locking. The refractive index
</p>
<p>of a material depends on the radiation intensity I,
</p>
<p>n(x, y, t) = n0 + n2 I (x, y, t), (13.24)
</p>
<p>where n0 is the refractive index and n2 the Kerr coefficient.
</p>
<p>Figure 13.6b shows the principle of the Kerr lens mode locking: a strong laser
</p>
<p>pulse produces a Kerr lens in the Kerr medium due to self-focusing of the radiation
</p>
<p>(Sect. 35.6). The Kerr lens is a transient lens; it exists only during the passage of the
</p>
<p>laser pulse through the Kerr medium. Focusing does not occur for radiation belonging
</p>
<p>to the wings of the temporal distribution of the intensity. Therefore, the Kerr lens cuts
</p>
<p>radiation in the wings of the temporal distribution of the intensity. At steady state
</p>
<p>oscillation of a femtosecond laser, a pulse lengthening during a round trip transit
</p>
<p>through the laser resonator is compensated by the action of the Kerr lens.
</p>
<p>The active medium itself, a Ti3+:Al2O3 crystal, is suitable as a Kerr lens in a
</p>
<p>titanium&ndash;sapphire laser. The Kerr coefficient of sapphire has the value n2 = 3 &times;
</p>
<p>10&minus;20 m2 W&minus;1; for an estimate of n2, see Sect. 35.6 and Problem 35.3. To reach a
</p>
<p>change of the refractive index (n = 1.74) by an appreciable amount (for example, by
</p>
<p>0.3), the power density of the radiation has to be very large (&sim; 1019 W m&minus;2).
</p>
<p>The titanium&ndash;sapphire femtosecond laser (Fig. 13.7a) contains a chirped mirror
</p>
<p>that compensates different optical path lengths of radiation of different wavelengths;
</p>
<p>a chirped mirror consists of an antireflecting surface layer and of multilayers com-
</p>
<p>posed of layers of different thicknesses. The orientation of the crystal surfaces of the
</p>
<p>titanium&ndash;sapphire crystal correspond to the Brewster angle. A pump laser produces
</p>
<p>population inversion. The spectral distribution of the radiation emitted by a femtosec-
</p>
<p>ond titanium&ndash;sapphire laser (Fig. 13.7b) corresponds (for pulses with a duration of
</p>
<p>about 5 fs) to a frequency width (110 THz), which is about a third of the carrier
</p>
<p>frequency (360 THz). Femtosecond pulse operation is possible at different carrier
</p>
<p>frequencies; however, a modification that corresponds to an effective spectral gain
</p>
<p>coefficient leads to a narrowing of the spectral gain coefficient profile and therefore
</p>
<p>to a lengthening of the femtosecond pulses.</p>

<p>of a mode locked
</p>
<p>titanium&ndash;sapphire laser
</p>
<p>Another technique of mode locking makes use of a saturable absorber. A laser
</p>
<p>pulse saturates the absorption. After each transit of a pulse through the saturated
</p>
<p>absorber, the pulse is amplified in the gain medium and the population of the upper
</p>
<p>laser level is strongly reduced. After each transit of a pulse, the population builds
</p>
<p>up again. Dye molecules solved in a solvent are suitable as saturable absorbers of
</p>
<p>visible radiation (Sect. 12.6).
</p>
<p>Later, we will discuss a further technique of passive mode locking, namely mode
</p>
<p>locking via an intensity-dependent reflectivity of a mirror (Sect. 15.6).
</p>
<p>13.3 Onset of Oscillation of a Mode-Locked
</p>
<p>Titanium&ndash;Sapphire Laser
</p>
<p>We now discuss onset of oscillation of a mode-locked titanium&ndash;sapphire femtosec-
</p>
<p>ond laser. After turning on the optical pumping of the titanium&ndash;sapphire crystal,
</p>
<p>spontaneous emission of radiation (fluorescence radiation) initiates oscillation of the
</p>
<p>laser.
</p>
<p>The gain coefficient of titanium&ndash;sapphire has its maximum at a frequency ν0 &asymp;
</p>
<p>350 THz (Fig. 13.8), while the maximum of the spectrum of spontaneous emission
</p>
<p>lies at a higher frequency; gain curve and fluorescence curve of titanium&ndash;sapphire
</p>
<p>are studied in Sects. 5.3 and 7.6, and in Chap. 17. Spontaneously emitted radiation
</p>
<p>emitted in the low frequency wing of the fluorescence spectrum initiates oscillation.
</p>
<p>The shape of the fluorescence spectrum deviates strongly from a Gaussian: emission
</p>
<p>of radiation is still very strong in the low frequency wing of the fluorescence line.
</p>
<p>Therefore, initial radiation is available in the whole range in which the gain coefficient
</p>
<p>is sufficiently large for building up laser oscillation. Finally, a radiation field is build
</p>
<p>up that corresponds to the shape of the gain coefficient (supposed that the elements in
</p>
<p>the laser resonator work appropriately in a very broad frequency band). At the onset of
</p>
<p>oscillation of the laser, spontaneous emission produces an initial photon distribution
</p>
<p>centered at ν0 +∆ν0/2. Amplification shifts the spectrum toward smaller frequencies</p>

<p>and can have, at steady state oscillation of the laser, the same Gaussian shape as the
</p>
<p>gain coefficient curve.
</p>
<p>A femtosecond laser, which operates with an active medium whose gain coefficient
</p>
<p>has a Gaussian profile, can have a spectral intensity profile that can also have a
</p>
<p>Gaussian shape (see Fig. 13.1). How is this possible? In order to answer this question,
</p>
<p>we study a titanium&ndash;sapphire femtosecond laser containing a Kerr lens.
</p>
<p>We discuss the corresponding requirement with respect to the Q-switch. In the
</p>
<p>steady state of an oscillating Q-switched laser, a field component Es (oscillating
</p>
<p>on mode s) reproduces itself after a round trip transit of the radiation through the
</p>
<p>resonator. This leads to the condition
</p>
<p>Vout Vs(ν) G(ν) = 1,
</p>
<p>where G(ν) is the gain factor for the field at frequency ν, Vout is the V factor
</p>
<p>describing output coupling loss, and Vs(ν) is the V factor describing intrinsic loss
</p>
<p>(Sect. 2.4). Vs(ν) should have a value near unity at frequencies of large gain. (While
</p>
<p>the gain factor is large during the time a pulse passes through the active medium and
</p>
<p>small in the time between two subsequent pulses, the loss factors do not depend on
</p>
<p>time.) If the gain factor is only slightly larger than unity, 2α(ν)Lac ≪ 1, then we
</p>
<p>can write G(ν) = 1 &minus; 2α(ν)Lac and find
</p>
<p>Vout Vi(ν) = 1 &minus; 2α(ν)Lac.
</p>
<p>Lac is the length of the active medium. Thus, in the special case described by the
</p>
<p>last equation, the gain curve has the same shape as the gain coefficient curve.
</p>
<p>13.4 Optical Frequency Comb
</p>
<p>In the preceding section, we assumed that the mode-locked fields have frequencies
</p>
<p>that are multiples of the repetition rate. We neglected three effects&mdash;Gouy phase
</p>
<p>shift; phase shift due to dispersion of the active medium; and phase shift due to
</p>
<p>dispersion of the optical elements.</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-50651-7_2">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-50651-7_2</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.4 Optical Frequency Comb 255
</p>
<p>We first discuss the influence of the Gouy phase shift on the wave packets gener-
</p>
<p>ated by a femtosecond laser. Instead of (13.7), the field is equal to
</p>
<p>Ẽ = A
</p>
<p>N&minus;1
&sum;
</p>
<p>s=0
</p>
<p>ei[(ω1+sΩ)t+ωGouyt] = A

<p>N&minus;1
&sum;
</p>
<p>s=0
</p>
<p>eisΩt ei(ω1+ωGouy)t , (13.25)
</p>
<p>where ωGouy = 2πνGouy is the Gouy angular frequency. It follows, from a calculation
</p>
<p>according to (13.10)&ndash;(13.15), that the field is given by
</p>
<p>E = A(t) cos(ωc + ωGouy)t, (13.26)
</p>
<p>A(t) = A
sin( 1
</p>
<p>2
NΩt)
</p>
<p>sin( 1
2
Ωt)
</p>
<p>. (13.27)
</p>
<p>While ωc is still a multiple of the repetition rate Ω , the frequency ωc + ωGouy is
</p>
<p>not a multiple of Ω (except for the Gouy phase zero). Taking into account that
</p>
<p>ωGouy ≪ ωc, we can write
</p>
<p>E = A(t) cos[ωct + ϕce(t)], (13.28)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>ϕce(t) = 2πνGouyt = ∆φ t/T (13.29)
</p>
<p>is a time-dependent phase, the carrier envelope phase, and ∆φ the Gouy phase shift
</p>
<p>per round trip transit. The carrier envelope phase varies slowly in comparison with
</p>
<p>the phase ωct . A variation by 2π occurs in a time distance that corresponds to many
</p>
<p>periods of the carrier frequency.
</p>
<p>A frequency comb (Fig. 13.9a) is characterized by:
</p>
<p>&bull; νc = ωc/2π = carrier frequency (near the frequency ν0 of maximum gain);
</p>
<p>&bull; fr = c/2L = 1/T =Ω/2π = pulse repetition rate (=pulse repetition frequency);
</p>
<p>&bull; fo = offset frequency;
</p>
<p>&bull; νl = l &times; fr + fo = frequencies of the frequency comb;
</p>
<p>&bull; νl+1 &minus; νl = Ω/2π = c/2L = frequency distance between next-near peaks.
</p>
<p>The halfwidth of a peak is determined by the pulse duration. The field (Fig. 13.9b)
</p>
<p>shows that there is a jitter between the A(t) curve and the cos(ωct + ϕce) curve. A(t)
</p>
<p>is periodic with the period 1/T . The cos(ωct + 2πνGouyt) term changes continuously
</p>
<p>its phase from 2πνGouyt = 0 to 2π but remains, in the time average, synchronous to
</p>
<p>A(t); the fields E1(t), E2(t), E3(t)and E4(t) (Fig. 13.9b) are the fields at the times
</p>
<p>t , t + f &minus;1o /4, t + f
&minus;1
o /2 and t + 3 f

<p>&minus;1
o /4, respectively.

<p>ize the active medium by the gain coefficient α(ω) (Fig. 13.10a). We assume that</p>

<p>the refractive index increases linearly with frequency (Fig. 13.10b), as expected for
</p>
<p>frequencies around the frequency ω0 of maximum gain (Sect. 9.4, Example). Above
</p>
<p>the center frequency ω0, the change of the refractive index is positive, causing an
</p>
<p>increase of the resonance frequencies of the laser resonator. Below ω0, the change
</p>
<p>of the refractive index is negative, causing a decrease of the resonance frequencies
</p>
<p>of the resonator. The frequency separation between next-near modes has a constant
</p>
<p>value (Fig. 13.10c) because the frequency shift is proportional to ω &minus; ω0. Without

<p>13.4 Optical Frequency Comb 259
</p>
<p>medium depends on the density of excited two-level states and depends therefore on
</p>
<p>the pump strength.
</p>
<p>A third effect contributes to the carrier envelope offset phase: dispersion of the
</p>
<p>optical elements in the resonator of a femtosecond laser. Depending on the sign of
</p>
<p>dn/dω, of an optical element (for instance, of a reflector), the corresponding change
</p>
<p>of phase can lead to an increase or a decrease of the frequency separation between
</p>
<p>next-near peaks of the frequency comb.
</p>
<p>Thus, the offset frequency of a femtosecond laser is the sum of the offset fre-
</p>
<p>quencies that are caused by Gouy phase shift, dispersion of the active medium, and
</p>
<p>dispersion of the optical elements.
</p>
<p>The field of a frequency comb has peaks the frequencies
</p>
<p>νl = l fr + fo. (13.47)
</p>
<p>To find exact values of the frequencies of a frequency comb, we have to determine
</p>
<p>three parameters: order l; pulse repetition rate fr; and frequency offset fo. For a
</p>
<p>particular laser, all three quantities can be determined experimentally with a high
</p>
<p>accuracy (Sect. 35.7) by the use of techniques based on nonlinear optics.
</p>
<p>Nonlinear dispersion, occurring in addition to linear dispersion, disturbs each
</p>
<p>pulse during a round trip transit through the laser resonator. This disturbance would
</p>
<p>continuously deform the shapes of the pulses. However, it is strongly suppressed
</p>
<p>from pulse to pulse by the Kerr lens. Due to the pulse shaping by the Kerr lens, the
</p>
<p>round trip transit time is strictly periodic: the pulses propagate within the resonator
</p>
<p>with the group velocity described by the envelope function A(t + T ) = A(t). The
</p>
<p>carrier wave (at the frequency ωc), on the other hand, propagates with the phase
</p>
<p>velocity.
</p>
<p>It is possible to broaden a frequency comb in the frequency space by the use
</p>
<p>of techniques of nonlinear Optics (Sect. 35.7). A broad frequency comb, extending
</p>
<p>over the entire visible spectral range, represents white light. Focusing ultrashort light
</p>
<p>pulses onto a transparent material (a solid, a liquid or a gas) can lead to generation
</p>
<p>of a white light continuum (with a spectral super broadening of the femtosecond
</p>
<p>pulses&mdash;the origin is the interplay of short pulses with a dispersive medium; for
</p>
<p>more information, see for instance [86]).
</p>
<p>13.5 Optical Correlator
</p>
<p>How can we determine the duration of femtosecond pulses? In an autocorrelator
</p>
<p>(Fig. 13.11a), a beam splitter divides the laser beam into two beams. The paths of the
</p>
<p>two beams are different but join each other after passing another beam splitter. A lens
</p>
<p>focuses the beams to a frequency doubler, which produces second harmonic radia-
</p>
<p>tion. A filter behind the frequency doubler blocks the radiation of the fundamental
</p>
<p>frequency. Another lens focuses the second harmonic radiation on a detector. The
</p>
<p>detector signal is a measure of the strength of the second harmonic radiation. The</p>

</p>
<p>two second-harmonic pulses arriving at the frequency doubler have equal strength.
</p>
<p>The detector has a large response time and monitors the average power of the sec-
</p>
<p>ond harmonic radiation. It is not necessary that the detector is able to resolves the
</p>
<p>single pulses temporally. A KDP crystal, which has a high nonlinearity of second
</p>
<p>harmonic generation, is suitable as a frequency doubler. The delay time between the
</p>
<p>two pulses is
</p>
<p>td = 2x/c, (13.48)
</p>
<p>where x is the shift of the movable mirror and where x = 0 corresponds to equal path
</p>
<p>lengths of the two pulses. The detector signal (Fig. 13.11b) has a maximum if the
</p>
<p>delay time is zero. The pulse duration follows from the shape of the signal curve. The
</p>
<p>intensity of the second harmonic radiation increases quadratically with the intensity,
</p>
<p>I (2ω, t, td) = K |I1(t)+ I2(t + td)|

</p>
<p>13.6 Pump-Probe Method
</p>
<p>The femtosecond pulses are suited to investigate the dynamics of fast processes.
</p>
<p>Examples are the studies of short-lived excited states of atoms, molecules or solids.
</p>
<p>Applications lie in fields of physics, chemistry, biology and medicine.
</p>
<p>In a pump-probe experiment (Fig. 13.12a), a pump pulse (of large pulse energy)
</p>
<p>and a probe pulse (of small pulse energy) are passing a sample containing, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, molecules. The pump pulse excites molecules into an excited state. The probe
</p>
<p>pulse excites molecules further to an energetically higher lying state, which decays
</p>
<p>by emission of fluorescence radiation. The second excitation is only possible dur-
</p>
<p>ing the lifetime (τ ) of the excited state. A pump-probe arrangement (Fig. 13.12b)
</p>
<p>consists of a femtosecond laser, a beam splitter and a delay section. To measure the
</p>
<p>fluorescence radiation, a detector with a large response time (large compared to the
</p>
<p>temporal separation of two subsequent pulses) is suitable. The detector signal S(td),
</p>
<p>determined for different time delays td, yields the lifetime τ of the first excited state
</p>
<p>(Fig. 13.12c); the delay time is td = 2x/c, where x = 0 corresponds to the situa-
</p>
<p>tion that probe and pump beam passed the same path length when they reach the
</p>
<p>sample.
</p>
<p>The pump-probe method provides ultrashort snapshots.

<p>13.8 Optical Frequency Analyzer
</p>
<p>In 2005, the Nobel Prize in physics was donated to Roy Glauber, John Hall, and
</p>
<p>Theodor H&auml;nsch for pioneering work in quantum optics and laser spectroscopy.
</p>
<p>Glauber performed theoretical investigations in the field of quantum optics. Hall and
</p>
<p>H&auml;nsch received the Nobel Prize &ldquo;for their contribution to the development of laser-
</p>
<p>based precision spectroscopy, including the optical frequency comb&rdquo;. The frequency
</p>
<p>comb is the basis of an optical frequency analyzer and, in future, most likely of a
</p>
<p>new frequency standard.
</p>
<p>The main part of an optical frequency analyzer (Fig. 13.14a) is a frequency comb.
</p>
<p>It consists of radiation at discrete frequencies (νl , νl+1, νl+2, ...). The frequency dis-
</p>
<p>tribution extends from the near infrared to the near ultraviolet. The optical frequency
</p>
<p>analyzer serves for determination of the frequency ν of a monochromatic radiation
</p>
<p>source (for instance of a highly stabilized continuous wave laser). The measurement
</p>
<p>of the beat frequency
</p>
<p>fbeat = νl &minus; ν, (13.52)
</p>
<p>yields the value of ν. The beat frequency is measured by frequency mixing of radiation
</p>
<p>at the frequencies νl and ν in a photodiode (Fig. 13.14b). The beat frequency can be
</p>
<p>in the range of 1&ndash;10 GHz.
</p>
<p>The frequencies νl are equally spaced. The exact position of a frequency νl is
</p>
<p>influenced by the Gouy phase and by dispersion effects (Sect. 13.4). In order to
</p>
<p>determine νl of a particular laser and to reach a high accuracy (1:10
&minus;16) of the
</p>
<p>frequency measurement, the operation of an optical frequency analyzer makes use
</p>
<p>of nonlinear optical effects (Sect. 35.7).</p>

</p>
<p>13.9 Terahertz Time Domain Spectroscopy
</p>
<p>Thetime domain spectroscopy [92&ndash;96] is a new spectroscopic method&mdash;it allows
</p>
<p>for the simultaneous measurement of the time dependences of both the amplitude
</p>
<p>and phase of an electromagnetic wave. The method is particularly suited to per-
</p>
<p>form spectroscopic investigations with coherent terahertz and sub-terahertz waves,
</p>
<p>in the frequency range from about 0.1 to 100 THz (wavelength range 3 &micro;m&ndash;0.3 mm).
</p>
<p>Applications lie in fields of physics, chemistry and biophysics. Optical properties of
</p>
<p>materials such as solids, liquids, chemicals and biomaterials can be determined.
</p>
<p>A THz time domain spectrometer (Fig. 13.15a) consists of a THz field generator
</p>
<p>and a THz field detector both operated by the use of the same femtosecond laser
</p>
<p>(pulse duration 10 fs; repetition rate 50 MHz). The beam of the femtosecond laser is
</p>
<p>split into a main beam (used for generation of the THz field) and a reference beam
</p>
<p>(for detection). The main beam passes a generator crystal and the reference beam
</p>
<p>passes, after a time delay, a detector crystal. The generator crystal emits coherent THz
</p>
<p>radiation pulses; their duration is much larger than the duration of the femtosecond
</p>
<p>pulses. THz radiation reflected from a sample is focused to the detector crystal. The
</p>
<p>reference beam serves for the measurement of the instantaneous strength of the THz
</p>
<p>field at the location of the detector crystal. Under the action of the THz field, the
</p>
<p>detector crystal becomes birefringent and rotates the polarization direction of the
</p>
<p>optical radiation. Therefore, the radiation is able to pass a polarizer and to give rise
</p>
<p>to a signal by a photodetector; without THz field, the polarizer blocks the optical
</p>
<p>radiation.
</p>
<p>The signal S(x) of the photodetector corresponds, with td = 2x/c, to the signal
</p>
<p>S(td) for different time delays td (Fig. 13.15b). S(td) is a measure of the time depen-
</p>
<p>dence of the THz field. A Fourier analysis of the S(td) curve yields (Fig. 13.15c) both
</p>
<p>the spectrum F(ν) of the amplitude and the spectrum ϕ(ν) of the phase of the THz
</p>
<p>field. From these informations, the complex reflectivity coefficient and thus real and
</p>
<p>imaginary parts of the dielectric response function of the sample can be extracted.</p>

</p>
<p>signal. (c) Amplitude and phase spectra
</p>
<p>The Fourier coefficients provide the connection between F(ν) and φ(ν), on one side,
</p>
<p>and the real part χ1(ν) and the imaginary part χ2(ν) of the susceptibility, on the other
</p>
<p>side.
</p>
<p>The origin of generation of a THz field is the difference frequency generation:
</p>
<p>nonlinear frequency mixing of the field components contained in a femtosecond
</p>
<p>pulse results in generation of a THz field. Femtosecond pulses with a spectral width
</p>
<p>of 100 THz lead to difference frequencies of all different field components from zero
</p>
<p>frequency to 100 THz. The difference frequency generation makes use of the non-
</p>
<p>linear polarization (Sect. 35.4). GaSe has a large nonlinear coefficient for difference
</p>
<p>frequency generation.
</p>
<p>Electrooptic crystals with large coefficients of THz field induced birefringence
</p>
<p>(used for detection) are GaSe and ZnTe.
</p>
<p>The method makes it possible, as mentioned, to determine amplitudes and phases
</p>
<p>of THz fields. Thus, the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility of materials
</p>
<p>can be determined. Almost all solid or liquid materials have excitations in the fre-
</p>
<p>quency range 1&ndash;100 THz. In this range, electrons, phonons and magnetic excitations
</p>
<p>determine optical properties of solids and biomolecules.
</p>
<p>Time-domain spectroscopy began with a fast switch, the Auston switch [97&ndash;100]
</p>
<p>(Fig. 13.16a). Irradiation of semi-insulating GaAs with a 100-fs pulse results in gen-
</p>
<p>eration of charge carriers. A static field produced with a static voltage (for instance
</p>
<p>80 V across a GaAs crystal of 50 &micro;m thickness) accelerates the electrons giving
</p>
<p>rise to generation of radiation. The spectrum of the radiation is determined by the
</p>
<p>temporal change of the current, dI/dt . The device acts as a Hertzian dipole. The
</p>
<p>spectrum of the radiation extends from &sim;100 GHz to several THz with a maximum
</p>
<p>at a wavelength around 1 mm (i.e., the radiation covers a range of sub-THz and THz
</p>
<p>frequencies). Another switch can be used as an antenna for measuring the instanta-
</p>
<p>neous strength of a THz field (Fig. 13.16b). The THz field accelerates Free-electrons
</p>
<p>that are created by means of a femtosecond pulse. Variation of the delay between the
</p>
<p>femtosecond pulse and the THz pulse at the detector makes it possible to determine</p>

<p>femtosecond pulse (duration 2.5 fs) of visible radiation focused on a box containing

<p>noble gas atoms (for instance neon) generates an attosecond pulse. The attosecond

</p>
<p>radiation lies mainly in the 10&ndash;20 nm range. Figure 13.17b shows an optical field
</p>
<p>pulse and a neon atom. The field excites electrons so strongly that they separate

<p>from the positive core (Fig. 13.17c). The field of a femtosecond pulse accelerates the</p>

<p>266 13 Femtosecond Laser
</p>
<p>electrons further and then decelerates them. The decelaration and the recombination
</p>
<p>of the electrons with the core results in the emission of attosecond radiation. The
</p>
<p>electron motion corresponds to a current I with a fast temporal change dI/dt giving
</p>
<p>rise to emission of an electromagnetic field (Fig. 13.17d). The process corresponds
</p>
<p>to a nonlinear polarization of the atoms (Sect. 35.2); see, for instance, [101&ndash;103].

<p>Gas Lasers
</p>
<p>A gas laser contains atoms or molecules. Stimulated transitions occur in atoms
</p>
<p>between electronic states and in molecules between rotational, vibrational or elec-
</p>
<p>tronic states. We describe various gas discharge lasers: helium&ndash;neon laser; metal
</p>
<p>vapor laser; argon ion laser; excimer laser; nitrogen laser; CO2 laser; and optically
</p>
<p>pumped gas lasers.
</p>
<p>The excimer laser and the CO2 laser are two important industrial lasers. The
</p>
<p>excimer laser generates intense UV radiation pulses. The CO2 laser is a source of
</p>
<p>infrared radiation. It has a high efficiency of conversion of electric power to power of
</p>
<p>laser radiation. The CO2 laser is very versatile&mdash;it operates as continuous wave laser
</p>
<p>or as pulsed laser. Optically pumped gas lasers (pumped with CO2 laser radiation)
</p>
<p>are suitable for generation of far infrared radiation.
</p>
<p>We first treat two line broadening mechanisms that play a role in gas lasers: the
</p>
<p>Doppler and the collision broadening. Then we discuss different gas lasers.
</p>
<p>14.1 Doppler Broadening of Spectral Lines
</p>
<p>Doppler broadening is a main broadening mechanism of spectral lines for gases at
</p>
<p>low pressure. The frequency of the radiation that is due to transitions between two
</p>
<p>discrete energy levels of an atom (or a molecule) is
</p>
<p>ν = ν0 + (vz/c) ν0, (14.1)
</p>
<p>where ν0 is the frequency of the radiation emitted by the atom at rest and vz is the
</p>
<p>velocity component in z direction. The atoms in a gas have a Maxwellian velocity

<p>is the Doppler linewidth. It depends on the temperature and the atomic mass of

<p>the atoms and is independent of the gas pressure. The Doppler broadening leads to a
</p>
<p>Gaussian line. TheDoppler broadening is an inhomogeneous broadeningmechanism
</p>
<p>because atoms of different velocities have emission lines (and absorption lines) at
</p>
<p>different frequencies.
</p>
<p>The gain coefficientα(ν) of an activemediumwith aDoppler broadened transition
</p>
<p>is proportional to the population difference N2 &minus; N1 (Fig. 14.1b). The halfwidth of
the gain curve is independent of N2 &minus; N1.

</p>
<p>14.2 Collision Broadening
</p>
<p>According to a classical description of collision broadening (= pressure broadening)
in gases, a collision of an excited atom with another (nonexcited) atom changes the
</p>
<p>phase of the sinusoidal oscillation of the excited atom. Therefore, collisions change
</p>
<p>the phase of radiation emitted by the atom (Fig. 14.2a); see also Sect. 4.11. The time
</p>
<p>τc between two collisions is a dephasing time. Between two collisions, an electron of
</p>
<p>the excited atom performs, in the picture of the classical oscillator model, (Sect. 4.8),
</p>
<p>an oscillation with the transition frequency.
</p>
<p>A Fourier analysis of the electric field emitted by the atom leads to a Lorentzian

</p>
<p>The linewidth is proportional to the pressure. K is a characteristic constant of a gas,
</p>
<p>σc is the cross section of collisions, m the mass of the gas molecules (or atoms) and
</p>
<p>p the gas pressure. At room temperature, K &sim; 1GHz/p, where p is measured in
units of bar; K has values between 0.3 and 2.5GHz/p, depending on the atoms or
</p>
<p>molecules.
</p>
<p>The collision broadening corresponds to a homogeneous broadening mechanism
</p>
<p>because all atoms are submitted to collisions. The absorption coefficient of radiation
</p>
<p>interacting with a pressure broadened transition is equal to
</p>
<p>αabs(ν) = (hν/c)B12gL(ν)N1. (14.14)
</p>
<p>N1 is the (number) density of molecules (atoms). The density is proportional to pres-
</p>
<p>sure. The maximum of the lineshape function is inversely proportional to pressure.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the absorption coefficient at line center is independent of pressure while
</p>
<p>the linewidth increases linearly with pressure (Fig. 14.2b).
</p>
<p>The gain coefficient of an active medium consisting of molecules with a collision
</p>
<p>broadened line is equal to
</p>
<p>α(ν) = (hν/c)B12gL(ν)&times; (N2 &minus; N1). (14.15)

<p>14.3 Helium&ndash;Neon Laser 275
</p>
<p>14.3 Helium&ndash;Neon Laser
</p>
<p>The helium&ndash;neon laser belongs, besides the ruby laser, to the two first lasers and is
</p>
<p>still in use. In the helium&ndash;neon laser, Ne atoms are excited into s states (Fig. 14.3a).
</p>
<p>Laser transitions are s &rarr; p transitions. The helium&ndash;neon laser is a three-level laser
type. Accidentally, the second lowest excited state of a helium atom (21S state) has
</p>
<p>almost the same energy as the 5s state of Ne. This coincidence allows for a selective
</p>
<p>excitation of the 5s state of Ne:
</p>
<p>&bull; In a gas discharge, electrons excite helium atoms; the excited helium atoms have
very long lifetimes.
</p>
<p>&bull; Atomic collisions between excited He and Ne atoms lead to a transfer of excitation
energy from He to Ne atoms.
</p>
<p>&bull; Stimulated 5s &rarr; 3p transitions result in generation of laser radiation of a wave-
length of 633nm.
</p>
<p>&bull; The 3p levels are depopulated by spontaneous emission of radiation (wavelength
near 450nm) by 3p&rarr; 3s transitions. The 3s state has a very long lifetime. Relax-
ation is possible via collisions of the neon atoms in the 3s state with the wall of
</p>
<p>the tube that contains the gas; it is a process of nonradiative relaxation. To obtain
</p>
<p>a sufficiently fast relaxation, a narrow gas tube is favorable.
</p>
<p>&bull; The lifetime of the 5s state is about 100ns and the lifetime of the 3p state about
10ns.
</p>
<p>&bull; Stimulated 5s&rarr; 4p transitions lead to generation of laser radiation of awavelength
of 3.4 &micro;m.
</p>
<p>The lowest excited state level of He (23S state) almost coincides with the 4s level
</p>
<p>of neon; the energy difference (&sim;40meV) is equal to &sim;2kT . Helium atoms, excited
by electron collisions to their lowest excited state, transfer the excitation energy to
</p>
<p>neon atoms resulting in a population of the 4s level of neon. Stimulated 4s &rarr; 3p
transitions lead to generation of laser radiation at a wavelength of 1.15 &micro;m.

</p>
<p>The helium&ndash;neon laser (Fig. 14.3b) contains a gas mixture of helium and neon
</p>
<p>(ratio 5:1; pressure&sim;5mbar) in a glass tube (typical length 0.5m; diameter 1&ndash;2mm).
Brewster windows close the tube. Radiation of the appropriate polarization passes
</p>
<p>the windows without reflection loss (see Fig. 2.16). A gas discharge (voltage&sim;2kV;
current &sim;10mA) leads to a laser output power (&sim;1mW at 633nm), which corre-
sponds to an efficiency of the order of 0.01%. There are different reasons that the
</p>
<p>efficiency is small: the quantum efficiency is small and the pump process is not very
</p>
<p>efficient in the helium&ndash;neon gas. The laser resonator (especially the coating on the
</p>
<p>dielectric reflectors) determines the wavelength of a helium&ndash;neon laser.
</p>
<p>Table14.1 shows data of different helium&ndash;neon lasers;Δνg is the gain bandwidth.
</p>
<p>The electronic configuration of Ne is 1s22s22p6. Excited states have the con-
</p>
<p>figurations 1s22s22p5&mdash;3s, 3p, 4s etc. The 3s, 3p, . . . levels are split because of the
</p>
<p>interaction of an excited electron with the hole in the 2p shell (spin-orbit interaction).
</p>
<p>The s levels are split into 4 sublevels and the p levels into 10 sublevels. Due to the
</p>
<p>level splitting, a large number of transitions are available as laser transitions&mdash;about
</p>
<p>a hundred laser lines (many of them in the infrared and far infrared) are known. The

</p>
<p>sublevel is 2p1 and the lowest 2p level is 2p10. In this notation (Paschen notation),
</p>
<p>the Ne+ core is considered as an effective potential and the states of the additional
electron are 1s, 2s, 2p, etc. An alternative, more detailed analysis uses the Racah
</p>
<p>notation: an excited neon atom has the configuration 1s22s22p5 plus an additional
</p>
<p>state with one electron (the outer electron). In the Racah notation, an energy level
</p>
<p>(for instance a 5s sublevel) is characterized by 5s[K]J or 5s&prime;[K]J, where the symbols
indicate the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; 5s or 5s&prime;; configuration of the outer electron.
&bull; K; quantum number of the sum of the total angular momentum Jc (quantum
number j) of the core electrons and the orbital momentum L (quantum number l)
</p>
<p>of the outer electron.
</p>
<p>&bull; J = K &plusmn; 1
2
, where 1
</p>
<p>2
is the quantum number of the spin of the outer electron.
</p>
<p>The coupling leads to 4 sublevels of s states (Fig. 14.4); s is attributed to a state with
</p>
<p>K = 3/2 and s&prime; to a state with K = 1/2. A p state has 10 sublevels; 3p[K] configura-
tions ( j = 3/2) are possible with K = 1/2, 3/2 and 5/2 while 3p&prime;[K] configurations
are possible with K = 1/2 and 3/2. The coupling corresponds to intermediate cou-
pling ( j&minus; l coupling). The energy levels (energy values, lifetimes, and assignment
to appropriate quantum states) have been studied long before the arrival of the laser;
</p>
<p>for discussions of Ne levels used in lasers, see [116&ndash;118].
</p>
<p>Applications. The helium&ndash;neon laser generates monochromatic radiation with a
</p>
<p>small beam divergence. The laser serves for various applications (e.g., holography),
</p>
<p>which need a high coherence and low beam divergence.
</p>
<p>14.4 Metal Vapor Laser
</p>
<p>Ametal vapor laser operateswith copper, gold, lead, or cadmiumvapor. In the copper
</p>
<p>vapor laser (Fig. 14.5), Cu atoms are excited by electron collisions from the ground
</p>
<p>state 3d104s to the 3d104p state, giving rise to stimulated transitions to 3d94s2 states.
</p>
<p>Fig. 14.5 Copper vapor laser</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>278 14 Gas Lasers
</p>
<p>The level splitting is due to spin&ndash;orbit interaction. The levels are labeled according
</p>
<p>to the LS coupling (Russel-Saunders coupling); a level 2S+1LJ corresponds to a state
with the quantum number L of the orbital momentum, the quantum number S of the
</p>
<p>spin, and the quantum number J = L + S of the total momentum. 2S+ 1 is the spin
multiplicity and the S, P, D states correspond to states with L = 0, 1, 2.
</p>
<p>A copper vapor laser consists of a ceramic tube (with Brewster windows) in the
</p>
<p>laser resonator. The tube contains a little piece of metallic copper. The laser oscilla-
</p>
<p>tion depends very sensitively on the gas pressure and therefore on the temperature.
</p>
<p>There is only a narrow temperature window (1,500 ◦C &plusmn; 20 ◦C) in which the laser
operates. Population inversion is produced by electric pulses (duration 20ns; pulse
</p>
<p>energy 10mJ; repetition rate 3kHz). An electric pulse causes a pulsed discharge and
</p>
<p>excitation of copper atoms via electron collisions. The lifetime of the upper laser level
</p>
<p>is smaller than the lifetime of the lower laser level. Therefore, continuous oscillation
</p>
<p>is not possible; the laser is a self-terminating laser.
</p>
<p>The copper vapor laser has a large gain coefficient (7 m&minus;1), and it has an excellent
beam quality because of a large diameter of the active medium and of the resonator.
</p>
<p>The efficiency of conversion of electric pump energy to energy of laser radiation is
</p>
<p>about 1%.
</p>
<p>Copper vapor lasers generate radiation at the wavelengths 510 and 578nm and
</p>
<p>gold vapor lasers at 628 and 312nm.
</p>
<p>Applications lie inmedicine, particularly in the detection anddestructionof tumors
</p>
<p>by the photodynamic therapy. Today, metal vapor lasers are competing with semi-
</p>
<p>conductor lasers.
</p>
<p>14.5 Argon Ion Laser
</p>
<p>In the argon ion laser (Fig. 14.6), subsequent electron collisions lead to ionization
</p>
<p>of argon atoms and to excitation of argon ions. The electron configurations are the
</p>
<p>following:

&bull; (Ar+)&lowast; 1s2 2p6 3s2 3p4 4p; excited argon ion.
</p>
<p>Different 4p&rarr; 4s transitions between the 3p44p and 3p44s levels (split due to spin&ndash;
orbit interaction) give rise to cw laser emission in the blue and green, with strong
</p>
<p>emission lines at 488 and 514.5nm.
</p>
<p>A gas discharge in a ceramic tube (diameter 1&ndash;2mm; length 1m; cooled with
</p>
<p>water) containing the argon gas (pressure 0.1mbar) pumps the argon ion laser.
</p>
<p>Because of the twofold excitation, the efficiency of the argon ion laser is propor-
</p>
<p>tional to the square of the current density in the gas discharge. At a high electric
</p>
<p>power (current 10A; voltage 5kV), the output power is large (20W). The efficiency
</p>
<p>of the laser is small (&le; 0.1%).
The krypton ion laser operates in the sameway as the argon ion laser; it emits radi-
</p>
<p>ation at other wavelengths (between 406 and 676nm). An important application of
</p>
<p>the argon and the krypton ion lasers is the optical pumping of other lasers, especially
</p>
<p>of the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser (and before this laser existed, the optical pumping of
</p>
<p>dye lasers). Today, semiconductor lasers serve as pump lasers.
</p>
<p>14.6 Excimer Laser
</p>
<p>We now treat an important industrial laser. The excimer laser makes use of the KrF
</p>
<p>excimer or of other excimers. The following processes occur in a KrF excimer laser
</p>
<p>(Fig. 14.7).
</p>
<p>&bull; A gas discharge in a mixture of krypton and fluorine gas produces (KrF)&lowast; mole-
cules, i.e., KrF molecules in an excited electronic state. The lifetime of the excited
</p>
<p>state is of the order of 10&minus;9 s.
&bull; Stimulated transitions take place to nonbonding KrF states. After a transition, the
Kr atom and the F atom repel each other and separate spatially. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>lower laser level has a shorter lifetime than the upper laser level. During an optical
</p>
<p>transition in a KrF excimer, the nuclear distance RKr&minus;F between the nucleus of Kr
and the nucleus of F does not change (Franck&ndash;Condon principle)&mdash;the transition
</p>
<p>corresponds to a vertical line in the energy-nuclear distance diagram.

<p>XeCl (308nm); XeF (351nm); KrBr (206nm); ArBr (161nm); NeF (108nm).
</p>
<p>The excimer laser is a TEA laser (transversely excited atmospheric laser). We will
</p>
<p>describe a TEA laser arrangement in connection with the CO2 laser (Sect. 14.8). The
</p>
<p>laser gas of a krypton fluoride excimer laser has the composition: He (= buffer gas,
pressure&sim;1bar); Kr (10%); and F2 (0.1%). At a large pump power density (200MW
per liter gas volume), the gain is about 10% per cm (gain coefficient α = 10m&minus;1).
</p>
<p>Data of an excimer laser: pumping by electric discharge pulses (voltage &sim;1MV,
current 10kA, pulse duration 30ns, electric energy per pulse 100J); laser pulse energy
</p>
<p>1J; efficiency 1%; repetition rate 1&ndash;50Hz.
</p>
<p>Applications of the excimer laser are: labelling (of semiconductor chips, glasses,
</p>
<p>polymers, etc.) during mass production; structuring of materials by means of UV
</p>
<p>lithography&mdash;in 2011, semiconductor structures of lateral size of 45nm are prepared
</p>
<p>by the use of the ArF laser (wavelength 193 nm).

<p>14.7 Nitrogen Laser
</p>
<p>The nitrogen laser is a prototype of a vibronic laser (Fig. 14.8). The electronic energy
</p>
<p>depends on the distance RN&minus;N between the nitrogen nuclei. A vibronic energy level
of N2 has electronic and vibrational energy,

</p>
<p>En is the electronic energy in the nth state; n = 1, ground state; n = 2, 3, . . .,
excited states; (v + 1/2)hνvib is the vibrational energy; v = 0, 1, 2, . . . are the vibra-
tional quantum numbers; and νvib (= 70.8THz) is the vibrational frequency. Electron
collisions in a gas discharge excite N2 molecules to vibronic states belonging to the
</p>
<p>n = 3 electronic state. Stimulated transitions to vibronic levels of the n = 2 electronic
level (energies E2,v) produce laser radiation in the near UV (near 337nm). The life-
</p>
<p>time (40ns) of the upper laser level is shorter than the lifetime of the lower laser level.
</p>
<p>Therefore, continuous operation is not possible; the laser is a self-terminating laser.
</p>
<p>Suitable for pumping are very short gas discharge pulses (duration 1ns). Optical
</p>
<p>transitions obey the Franck&ndash;Condon principle.
</p>
<p>14.8 CO2 Laser
</p>
<p>The CO2 laser is of great importance:
</p>
<p>&bull; It has a high efficiency (10&ndash;50%) for conversion of electrical power to power of
laser radiation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Different ways of operation are possible; in particular, cw operation, pulsed oper-
ation, and TEA laser operation.
</p>
<p>&bull; The cw CO2 laser generates cw radiation of a large power (100 W at a length of
the active medium of about 1m, and up to 1,000W or even more at very large
</p>
<p>length of the active medium).
</p>
<p>&bull; The TEA (transversely excited atmospheric) CO2 laser produces pulses (duration
&sim;100ns) of high peak power (100kW).
</p>
<p>Applications of CO2 lasers concern material processing (cutting, welding, hardening
</p>
<p>of metal surfaces, shock hardening at power densities of 109 W/cm2) and medicine.
</p>
<p>The CO2 laser (Fig. 14.9a) makes use of vibrational-rotational levels,
</p>
<p>E = Evib(v1, v2, v3)+ Erot(J ). (14.17)
</p>
<p>Evib is the vibrational energy and Erot the rotational energy (J = quantum number
of the rotation). The vibrational energy is
</p>
<p>Evib =

</p>
<p>where the oscillation frequency ν1 (= 41.6THz) corresponds to the symmetric
valence vibration, ν2 (=20.0THz) to the bending vibration, and ν3 (=70.5THz)
to the antisymmetric valence vibration (Fig. 14.9b); v1, v2, and v3 are the vibrational
</p>
<p>quantum numbers; v1 = 0, 1, 2, . . .; v2 = 0, 1, 2, . . .; v3 = 0, 1, 2, . . .. We denote a
state with the quantum numbers v1, v2, and v3 as v1v2v3 state.

<p>Electron collisions in a gas discharge can excite CO2 molecules. More effi-
</p>
<p>cient is the indirect excitation. Electron collisions produce excited N2 molecules</p>

</p>
<p>c Vibrational-rotational transitions in CO2
</p>
<p>(in the lowest vibrational state); an excitedN2 molecule in the lowest vibrational state
</p>
<p>has a very large lifetime. Energy transfer processes by collisions between excited N2
molecules and nonexcited CO2 molecules lead to population of the 001 state of CO2
molecules. This state has a very long lifetime (&sim;4 s) with respect to spontaneous
emission of radiation that is due to 001 &rarr; 100 and 001 &rarr; 100 transitions. There
are two groups of laser transitions corresponding to two wavelength regions:
</p>
<p>&bull; 10.6 &micro;m; transitions 001 &rarr; 100; frequencies near 28THz.
&bull; 9.6 &micro;m; transitions 001 &rarr; 020; frequencies near 31THz.
</p>
<p>The transitions between different types of vibrations are allowed due to the anhar-
</p>
<p>monicity of the vibrations. The depopulation of the lower states occurs by collisions
</p>
<p>of the molecules with walls (nonradiative relaxation). A vibrational transition in a
</p>
<p>CO2 molecule is associated with a change of the rotational energy (Fig. 14.9c), where
</p>
<p>one of the selection rules
</p>
<p>ΔJ = &plusmn;1 (14.19)
</p>
<p>must be fulfilled. The selection rule ΔJ = +1 corresponds to laser lines in the P
branch and the selection ruleΔJ = &minus;1 in laser lines in the R branch. The rotational
energy is (approximately)
</p>
<p>Erot = B J (J + 1); B =
�
2
</p>
<p>2Θ
. (14.20)
</p>
<p>B (&sim;15GHz times h) is the rotational constant that is a measure of the rotational
energy and Θ is the moment of inertia of a CO2 molecule; each J state is 2J + 1
fold degenerate.
</p>
<p>Not all rotational quantum numbers lead to allowed states. The CO2 molecule is
</p>
<p>a Boson (more exactly, the 12C16O2 molecule). Interchange of the two O atoms must
</p>

</p>
<p>The frequency distance between two neighboring lines is 2 &times; 2B/h = 4B/h.
Because of centrifugal distortion, the distance between two neighboring lines is not
</p>
<p>exactly 4B/h but depends on the vibrational quantum number and on the rotational
</p>
<p>quantumnumber.About twentydiscrete laser lines belong to eachof the four branches
</p>
<p>(Fig. 14.10a). The distance between next&mdash;near lines is&sim;60GHz, or less because of
the centrifugal distortion.
</p>
<p>A gas discharge pumps the cw CO2 laser (Fig. 14.10b). The gas, a mixture of
</p>
<p>CO2, N2, and He (at a ratio of about 1:1:8), can have a pressure of about 1mbar. The
</p>
<p>glass tube (diameter 1cm) that contains the laser gas is closed by Brewster windows
</p>
<p>(NaCl crystal plates). The spherical output coupling mirror consists of crystalline
</p>
<p>germanium. The outer side of the germaniummirror is covered with an antireflecting
</p>
<p>dielectric multilayer coating. Thus, standing waves in the output coupling mirror
</p>
<p>are avoided. The other surface, covered with another dielectric multilayer coating,
</p>
<p>has a reflectivity (&sim;95%) that is appropriate to reach optimum output coupling.</p>

<p>A power supply charges a Marx generator (a capacitor bank with many capacitors in

<p>electric pulse (voltage 100kV; current 100A; duration 20ns). The electric pulse,
</p>
<p>guided to one of the electrodes, causes a transverse discharge between the elec-
</p>
<p>trodes. The electrodes (distance 1cm, length 40cm) of the TEA laser (Fig. 14.10d)
</p>
<p>have a special profile (Rogowski profile) providing a homogeneous discharge. Arc
</p>
<p>discharges between the tips of metal needles initiate the discharge. The arc dis-
</p>
<p>charges produce UV radiation, which causes pre-ionization of molecules in the vol-
</p>
<p>ume between themain electrodes. A gas discharge between pairs of needles, arranged
</p>
<p>along the electrodes (on both sides of the discharge volume), occurs when a high
</p>
<p>voltage pulse arrives at the electrodes. The TEA laser is a multi-mode laser; a single
</p>
<p>pulse consists of radiation at several modes (longitudinal and transverse modes).
</p>
<p>At small gas pressure, Doppler broadening of the vibrational-rotational lines
</p>
<p>of CO2 determines the width of the lines (Fig. 14.11). Collision broadening dom-
</p>
<p>inates at pressures between 5mbar and about 1,000mbar; in this pressure range,
</p>
<p>the gain bandwidth increases proportionally to pressure. At still higher pressure,
</p>
<p>the vibrational-rotational lines overlap partly and above a pressure of 20 bar the sin-
</p>
<p>gle vibrational-rotational lines overlap completely. Then the gain profile of each of
</p>
<p>the four branches is continuous and has a width of about 500GHz. A mode locked

</p>
<p>Far Infrared Lasers
</p>
<p>Beside CO2 lasers, there are other infrared and far infrared gas discharge lasers
</p>
<p>(Fig. 14.12). Laser oscillation is due to stimulated emission of radiation by transitions
</p>
<p>between vibrational-rotational levels (CO laser) or between rotational levels (D2O
</p>

</p>
<p>The CO2 laser is suitable for optical pumping of other gas lasers. Lasers operated
</p>
<p>with gases of CH3F, D2O, and alcoholmolecules (andmany other organicmolecules)
</p>
<p>emit far infrared radiation at a large number of wavelengths.
</p>
<p>Figure14.13a shows an example of an optically pumped gas laser. Radiation of
</p>
<p>a CO2 laser excites CH3F from the vibrational ground state to an excited vibra-
</p>
<p>tional state. The vibration of the CH3F molecule corresponds to a vibration of CH3
against F (Fig. 14.13b). Stimulated rotational transitions (J = 13 &rarr; J = 12) gen-
erate far infrared laser radiation (wavelength 496 &micro;m, frequency near 605GHz).
</p>
<p>A lens focuses the radiation of a CO2 laser into a glass tube that contains the gas
</p>
<p>(Fig. 14.13c). A filter absorbs CO2 laser radiation passing the tube.
</p>
<p>Optical pumping is also possible if the CO2 laser line and the absorption line of
</p>
<p>CH3F do not completely coincide. Then stimulated Raman scattering (Sect. 35.8)
</p>
<p>results in generation of far infrared radiation. A variation of the CO2 laser frequency
</p>
<p>leads to a variation of the frequency of the far infrared laser. The tuning range,
</p>
<p>however, is small (about 0.1% relative to a far infrared laser line).
</p>
<p>The optically pumped gas lasers emit, depending on the gas and the wavelength
</p>
<p>of the CO2 pump laser, radiation at a very large number of frequencies (about ten
</p>
<p>thousand laser lines have been reported).Agas laser pumpedby aTEA laser generates
</p>
<p>intense far infrared radiation pulses (pulse power about 1kW [119]).
</p>
<p>In comparison with optically pumped cw far infrared gas lasers, quantum cascade
</p>
<p>lasers (Chap.29) are becoming important alternatives. In comparisonwith far infrared</p>

</p>
<p>Solid State Lasers
</p>
<p>We discuss solid state lasers that make use of electronic states of impurity ions in a
</p>
<p>dielectric crystals or in glasses&mdash;other types of solid state lasers, namely semicon-
</p>
<p>ductor lasers that are based on electrons in energy bands of semiconductors, will be
</p>
<p>treated in later chapters.
</p>
<p>We describe the principle of the ruby laser. We treat the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser
</p>
<p>in more detail than in an earlier chapter. We mention other broadband solid state
</p>
<p>lasers. Then we present a description of the neodymium-doped YAG laser, of other
</p>
<p>neodymium lasers, and of other YAG lasers. We describe disk lasers and fiber lasers.
</p>
<p>We give a short survey of solid state lasers with respect to host materials and impu-
</p>
<p>rities. Finally, we describe line broadening processes occurring in solid state laser
</p>
<p>media.
</p>
<p>The active medium of a disk laser has the form of a disk rather than the form of
</p>
<p>a rod. A disk laser pumped with a semiconductor laser has a high beam quality.
</p>
<p>Glass lasers are used for generation of near infrared radiation of different wave-
</p>
<p>lengths. The neodymium-doped glass laser can produce intense radiation pulses at
</p>
<p>a wavelength at 1.05 &micro;m. Doped glass fiber lasers generate radiation in the wave-
</p>
<p>length range 0.7&ndash;3 &micro;m. Fiber lasers are robust and flexible. They are suitable for
</p>
<p>applications in many areas (material processing, biophysics, medicine); fiber lasers
</p>
<p>are able to generate continuous wave radiation or picosecond pulses.
</p>
<p>15.1 Ruby Laser
</p>
<p>A ruby laser (Fig. 15.1) uses Cr3+ ions in an Al2O3 (sapphire) crystal with a doping
</p>
<p>concentration of typically 0.05% by weight Cr2O3; the density of Cr
3+ ions is N0 =
</p>
<p>1.6&times; 1025 m&minus;3. An excited Cr3+ ion in Al2O3 has two long-lived energy levels with
</p>
<p>a small energy separation. The lifetime of the levels with respect to spontaneous
</p>
<p>emission of radiation is about 3ms. Two broad energy bands are suited as pump
</p>
<p>bands. The optical transitions between the long-lived levels and the ground state
</p>
<p>level occur at two slightly different wavelengths (R1 fluorescence line at 694.3nm

</p>
<p>field that is present, in addition to a cubic crystalline field, at the sites of the Cr3+
</p>
<p>impurity ions in sapphire). The ground state level is identical with the lower laser
</p>
<p>level. By optical pumping into a pump band and fast nonradiative relaxation, the
</p>
<p>upper laser levels are populated. At sufficiently strong pumping, the populations
</p>
<p>of the upper laser levels are larger than the population of the ground state level.
</p>
<p>The gain cross section (at the center frequencies of the two lines) has the value
</p>
<p>σ21 = 2.5&times; 10
&minus;24 m2.
</p>
<p>The further development of the ruby laser, after its first operation (in 1960 [120]),
</p>
<p>stimulated the development of special high-power discharge lamps (continuously
</p>
<p>working lamps and pulsed flash lamps too). Today, pumping of a ruby laser is possible
</p>
<p>with radiation of another laser. The long lifetime of the upper laser level makes it
</p>
<p>possible to excite almost all Cr3+ ions in a ruby crystal and to produce, by Q-
</p>
<p>switching, pulses of very large pulse energy.
</p>
<p>15.2 More About the Titanium&ndash;Sapphire Laser
</p>
<p>In an earlier chapterwehave already introduced the titanium-sapphire laser (Ti:Al2O3
laser). Here, we discuss the laser in more detail.
</p>
<p>We can describe the energy level diagram of Ti3+ in Al2O3 (Fig. 15.2, left) in a
</p>
<p>formal way. We introduce the configuration coordinate Q. It describes an average
</p>
<p>distance between a Ti3+ ion and neighboring ions. The energy of a level depends
</p>
<p>on Q. The energy curve E(Q) indicates that the ground state is accompanied by
</p>
<p>vibronic levels. The energy of a vibronic level is composed of electronic and vibra-
</p>
<p>tional energy. Q0 is the configuration coordinate at which the energy minimum of
</p>
<p>the electronic ground state occurs. Correspondingly, the E&lowast;(Q) curve indicates that
</p>
<p>the excited state of Ti3+ is accompanied by vibronic energy levels too. The configu-
</p>
<p>ration coordinate Q&lowast;0 at which the energy minimum of excited Ti
3+ occurs is larger
</p>
<p>than Q0.

3+ ion. b Crystal field splitting of the 3d state of

<p>Ti3+. c Vibronic energy levels due to coupling to a phonon
</p>
<p>&bull; In an optical absorption process, a Ti3+ ion is excited from the ground-state level
</p>
<p>(level 0) to a vibronic level (level 3) of the electronically excited state.
</p>
<p>&bull; Fast nonradiative relaxation (relaxation time &sim;10&minus;13 s) leads to population of the
</p>
<p>lowest excited-state level (level 2) of Ti3+.
</p>
<p>&bull; An optical transition occurs to a vibronic level of the electronic ground state.
</p>
<p>&bull; After fast relaxation (relaxation time&sim;10&minus;13 s), the Ti3+ ion is in its ground state.
</p>
<p>Optical transitions are governed by the Franck&ndash;Condon principle: optical transitions
</p>
<p>occur without a change of the atomic distances.
</p>
<p>We now discuss the origin of the vibronic energy levels of Ti3+ in Al2O3. The
</p>
<p>Ti3+ ion has the electron configuration 1s22s22p63s23p63d. It has filled shells (like
</p>
<p>an argon atom) and an external electron in the 3d shell. The 3d state of the free Ti3+
</p>
<p>ion is fivefold degenerate according to the quantum number (l = 2) of the orbital
</p>
<p>momentum.
</p>
<p>A Ti3+ ion in an Al2O3 crystal (Fig. 15.3a) is surrounded by an octahedron of
</p>
<p>oxygen ions (O2&minus; ions). In the field of the ions (crystal field), the 3d state splits</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>294 15 Solid State Lasers
</p>
<p>(Fig. 15.3b) into two states, one shows a threefold and the other a twofold degeneracy
</p>
<p>with respect to the electron orbital. The threefold degenerate state is the ground state
</p>
<p>of Ti3+ in Al2O3 and the twofold state is the lowest excited state; the energy level
</p>
<p>splitting is about 3eV. These two electronic states are the basis of the titanium&ndash;
</p>
<p>sapphire laser.
</p>
<p>An oscillation of the oxygen octahedron is associated with an oscillating electric
</p>
<p>field at the site of a Ti3+ ion. The field influences the orbital of the 3d electron
</p>
<p>and therefore the electron states. An oscillation of the octahedron couples to lattice
</p>
<p>vibrations of the whole crystal. Vice versa, all lattice vibrations of the Al2O3 crystal
</p>
<p>couple to an oxygen octahedron and therefore to the electronic states of a Ti3+ ion.
</p>
<p>The coupling gives rise to a distribution of electronic ground state levels as well as of
</p>
<p>excited state levels. The energy of the electronic ground state of Ti3+ is (Fig. 15.3c)
</p>
<p>E = E0,e + Evib. (15.1)
</p>
<p>E0,e is the electronic energy of Ti
3+ without oscillation and Evib the energy levels.
</p>
<p>The levels are vibronic (=vibro-electronic) energy levels. The corresponding states
</p>
<p>are vibronic states.
</p>
<p>The energy of the electronically excited state of Ti3+ is
</p>
<p>E&lowast; = E&lowast;0,e + Evib. (15.2)
</p>
<p>E&lowast;0,e is the electronic energy of the excited state and Evib again the vibrational energy.
</p>
<p>E&lowast; is the energy of a vibronic state of excited Ti3+.
</p>
<p>A single vibration of an Al2O3 crystal has the vibrational energy

<p>Evib =

</p>
<p>tion, and 1

hνvib the zero point energy of the vibration.
</p>
<p>An Al2O3 crystal has a large number of vibrational frequencies; the number of
</p>
<p>different lattice vibrations is of the order of 1022 for a crystal volume of 1cm3.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the vibronic levels have a continuous energy distribution. The different
</p>
<p>energy levels of Ti3+ in Al2O3 are:
</p>
<p>&bull; E0 = E0,e+ zero point energy of all vibrations= energy of the ground state level.
</p>
<p>&bull; E2 = E
&lowast;
</p>
<p>0,e+ zero point energy of all vibrations = lowest energy of the excited
</p>
<p>state.
</p>
<p>&bull; E1 = E0 + Evib = lower laser levels, having a broad energy distribution.
</p>
<p>The spontaneous lifetime of a vibronic level of an excited Ti3+ ion is &sim;3.8 &micro;s.
</p>
<p>Our discussion shows that the occurrence of a broad distribution of pump levels
</p>
<p>and of a broad distribution of lower laser levels in titanium&ndash;sapphire is a consequence
</p>
<p>of the vibronic character of the energy levels of Ti3+ in Al2O3. We will derive the</p>

</p>
<p>other lasers.
</p>
<p>15.3 Other Broadband Solid State Lasers
</p>
<p>We compare the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser with other broadband tunable solid state
</p>
<p>lasers (Table15.1): alexandrite laser; Cr:LiSAF laser (chromium-doped lithium
</p>
<p>strontium aluminum fluoride laser); and Cr:LiCaF laser (chromium-doped lithium
</p>
<p>calcium fluoride laser). The wavelength λ given in the table is the wavelength of
</p>
<p>maximum gain coefficient. Titanium&ndash;sapphire has the largest gain bandwidth Δνg.
</p>
<p>The alexandrite laser was the first solid state laser that was tunable over a wide
</p>
<p>wavelength range (700&ndash;820nm). In alexandrite (BeAl2O4 crystal doped with Cr
3+),
</p>
<p>the Cr3+ ions (concentration 3&times; 1025 m&minus;3) replace about 0.1% of the Al3+ ions. The
</p>
<p>energy levels of Cr3+ in alexandrite, used in the laser, are (Fig. 15.4) the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; 0; ground state. Q0 is the configuration coordinate of the energy minimum of the
</p>
<p>vibronic ground state levels.
</p>
<p>&bull; 1A; vibronic band of the ground state.
</p>
<p>&bull; 2A; vibronic band of excited Cr3+; spontaneous lifetime 1.5ms.
</p>
<p>&bull; 2B; another vibronic band of excited Cr3+, 70meV above the 2A band; sponta-
</p>
<p>neous lifetime of 1.5&micro;s. Q⋆0 is the configuration coordinate of the energyminimum
</p>
<p>of this vibronic band.

</p>

</p>
<p>Optical pumping and fast relaxation result in populations of the 2A and the 2B
</p>
<p>vibronic bands. The population of each of the vibronic bands is in thermal equilibrium
</p>
<p>and the populations of the two bands are in thermal equilibrium with each other. The
</p>
<p>equilibrium is determined by the crystal temperature. To obtain a large population
</p>
<p>of 2B levels, the crystal is kept at an elevated temperature (60 ◦C or higher). Laser
</p>
<p>transitions occur around a wavelength of 760nm within a width of about 100nm.
</p>
<p>The energy levels of Cr3+ in LiSAF and LiCaF are similar to the energy levels of
</p>
<p>Cr3+ in alexandrite. There is, however, an important difference: the energy minimum
</p>
<p>of the 2B band lies below the minimum of the 2A band. Therefore, heating of the
</p>
<p>crystals is not necessary.
</p>
<p>Alexandrite, Cr3+:LiSAF, and Cr3+:LiCaF lasers can be used for the same tasks as
</p>
<p>the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser. Titanium&ndash;sapphire has the advantage that the crystalline
</p>
<p>material has a larger hardness and a higher heat conductivity.
</p>
<p>15.4 YAG Lasers
</p>
<p>A Nd:YAG laser (YAG = Y3Al5O12 = yttrium aluminum garnet) can have a high
</p>
<p>beam quality and can be operated as a cw or as a pulsed laser. Applications:
</p>
<p>&bull; Material processing: drilling, point welding, marking.
</p>
<p>&bull; Medicine: surgery, (Nd:YAG laser radiation can be guidedwith a glass fiber into the
</p>
<p>interior of a body and focused by a lens); eye surgery; applications in dermatology,
</p>
<p>see, for instance [127&ndash;129].
</p>
<p>A neodymium YAG laser (Fig. 15.5a) makes use of energy levels of Nd3+. The
</p>
<p>Nd atom has the electron configuration 4f35s25p66s2. The free Nd3+ ion has the con-
</p>
<p>figuration 4f25s25p6; the two lowest energy levels are 4I9/2 and

<p>electric field causes a splitting of these levels (not shown in the figure). Energetically
</p>
<p>higher lying levels serve for optical pumping. Optical pumping and fast relaxation
</p>
<p>leads to population of the long-lived 4F3/2 level (spontaneous lifetime 230 &micro;s). The
</p>
<p>laser transition 4F3/2 &rarr;
4I11/2 corresponds to a wavelength of 1.064 &micro;m (frequency
</p>
<p>&sim;300THz).
</p>
<p>YAG crystals can be prepared in a very high crystal quality. Nd3+ ions can replace
</p>
<p>about 1% of the Y3+ ions. Optical pumping of a neodymium YAG laser is possible
</p>
<p>with a lamp or with a semiconductor laser. Depending on the size of a laser crystal,
</p>
<p>a neodymium YAG laser can produce laser radiation at power levels of 1&ndash;10 W or
</p>
<p>more. Operated as a giant pulse laser, a Nd:YAG laser can generate pulses of an
</p>
<p>energy of 1 J.
</p>
<p>Other laser frequencies of the Nd3+:YAG laser lie at 0.914 &micro;m.
</p>
<p>(4F3/2 &rarr;
4I9/2 transitions) and at 1.35 &micro;m (

</p>
<p>laser (InGaAs laser) by transitions between 7F3/2 sublevels and
7F5/2 sublevels.
</p>
<p>The Yb3+ ions can replace 6% of the Y3+ ions in YAG. The ytterbium-doped YAG
</p>
<p>laser is becoming a competitor of the neodymium-doped YAG laser. Due to a high
</p>
<p>concentration of impurity ions, ytterbium-dopedYAGcrystals are especially suited
</p>
<p>as active media of lasers of small length (namely disk lasers, Sect. 15.6).
</p>
<p>&bull; Praseodymium-doped YAG laser. Pr3+ ions replace Y3+ ions. The doping can be
</p>
<p>extraordinarily high; it is possible to replace about 26% of the Y3+ ions by Pr3+
</p>
<p>ions. The Pr:YAG laser, pumped with radiation of a semiconductor laser, emits
</p>
<p>infrared radiation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Erbium-doped YAG lasers (Fig. 15.6). The free erbium (Er) atomhas the configura-
</p>

</p>
<p>configuration [Xe]4f115s25p6. The Er3+ ion, doped into a solid, has a long-lived
</p>
<p>excited state 4I11/2. Laser transitions,
4I11/2 &rarr;
</p>
<p>4I13/2, generate infrared radiation
</p>
<p>(wavelength 2.94 &micro;m). Pumping of the erbium-doped YAG laser, via the narrow
4I11/2 or
</p>
<p>4I9/2 levels, is possible with a semiconductor laser (at 980nm or 800nm);
</p>
<p>it is possible to operate an erbium-doped YAG laser at 1.54 &micro;m as a three-level

<p>15.5 Different Neodymium Lasers
</p>
<p>Various other solids doped with Nd3+ are suitable as active media (Table15.3).
</p>
<p>&bull; The Nd:YVO4 laser emits at the same wavelength (1.064 &micro;m) as the Nd
3+:YAG
</p>
<p>laser. With respect to applications, the Nd3+:YVO4 laser competes with the
</p>
<p>Nd3+:YAG laser.
</p>
<p>&bull; Nd:YLF laser (= Nd:LiYF4 = neodymium-doped lithium yttrium fluoride laser).
</p>
<p>The laser emits at 1.047 &micro;m and 1.053 &micro;m. Pumping is possible with a semicon-
</p>
<p>ductor laser (pump band at 804nm, halfwidth 4nm). The laser is also an alternative
</p>
<p>to the Nd:YAG laser.
</p>
<p>&bull; Neodymium-doped glass laser. In glass, Nd3+ ions occupy sites with different
</p>
<p>surroundings and different crystal fields. This leads to an inhomogeneous broad-
</p>
<p>ening of the excited-state levels. The halfwidth of the corresponding line (&sim;6THz)
</p>
<p>allows for generation of picosecond pulses. There are broad pump bands around
</p>
<p>750 and 810nm.
</p>
<p>The lasers can generate radiation at power levels in the 10&ndash;100W range.

<p>15.6 Disk Lasers
</p>
<p>A disk laser is a compact, highly efficient laser. It produces radiation of high power
</p>
<p>(1kW or more). Applications lie in fields (cutting, welding, labeling), in competition
</p>
<p>with the Nd:YAG laser.
</p>
<p>A disk laser (Fig. 15.7) consists of a disk (thickness 100&ndash;200 &micro;m), pumped with
</p>
<p>a semiconductor laser. Because of the large diameter, the disk laser has a high beam
</p>
<p>quality. A large concentration ofYb3+ ions inYb3+:YAGallows for a compact design
</p>
<p>of the laser. We described the laser principle in the preceding section.
</p>
<p>In comparison with a laser medium with a rod shape, the disk laser has a larger
</p>
<p>ratio of cooling area and active volume. The temperature distribution within the
</p>
<p>active medium has a nearly homogeneous radial distribution. This leads to a high
</p>
<p>beam quality.
</p>
<p>A Nd:YVO4 laser can be operated as miniature picosecond laser (Fig. 15.8).
</p>
<p>A semiconductor laser (808nm) pumps the laser, which emits radiation at 1,064nm.
</p>
<p>The laser can generate picosecond pulses (duration 10ps) at a high repetition rate
</p>
<p>(e.g., 30GHz). Mode locking is possible by use of a mirror with a reflectivity that
</p>
<p>depends on the radiation intensity. The reflectivity is small at small intensity and large
</p>
<p>at high intensity. The mirror is a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM).
</p>
<p>A Nd:GdVO4 laser has similar properties as the Nd:YVO4 laser.

</p>
<p>15.7 Fiber Lasers
</p>
<p>Fiber lasers are important glass lasers. Fiber lasers havemany applications in fields of
</p>
<p>material processing, chemistry, medicine, biology. The second harmonic radiation of
</p>
<p>glass fiber lasers serves for pumping of other lasers, e.g., of disk lasers. In comparison
</p>
<p>with other solid state lasers, fiber lasers are flexible and simple with respect to
</p>
<p>adjustment (or may not need adjustment at all).
</p>
<p>The active medium of a fiber laser is a glass that is doped with rare earth ions. We
</p>
<p>describe here main features of a fiber laser (Fig. 15.9a):
</p>
<p>&bull; Glass fiber (length 1&ndash;10m, or longer; diameter 5 &micro;m), doped with ions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Dichroitic end mirror. It is highly reflecting for the laser radiation and transparent
</p>
<p>for the pump radiation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Output coupling mirror. In order to reach optimum efficiency, the reflectivity of
</p>
<p>the output coupling mirror is chosen appropriately.
</p>
<p>&bull; A fiber laser can be pumped with a semiconductor laser.
</p>
<p>The pump waveguide either coincides with the laser waveguide (Fig. 15.9b) or has a
</p>
<p>larger diameter (Fig. 15.9c).
</p>
<p>Fiber lasers are available in the 0.7&ndash;3 &micro;m wavelength range. Rare earth ions in a
</p>
<p>glass occupy sites of different strength of the crystalline electric field. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>energy levels of the electronic states of ions in a glass are energetically distributed and
</p>
<p>the gain curves are broader than for rare earth ions in a crystal. The gain bandwidth
</p>
<p>can have a value of 10% of the center frequency of the gain curve.
</p>
<p>Table15.4 shows a list of fiber lasers:
</p>
<p>&bull; Ytterbium-doped glass laser (Yb3+ fiber laser). This laser generates radiation in a
</p>
<p>wavelength range near 1 &micro;m.

</p>
<p>&bull; 1.5-&micro;m erbium-doped fiber laser (Pr3+/Er3+ fiber laser). The erbium-doped fiber
</p>
<p>laser makes use of the three energy levels 4I15/2 (ground state),
4I13/2 and
</p>
<p>4I11/2 of
</p>
<p>Er3+ (Fig. 15.10a). The 1.5-&micro;m erbium-doped fiber laser is based on stimulated
4I13/2 &rarr;
</p>
<p>4I15/2 transitions. The absorption coefficient for pump radiation is much
</p>
<p>larger if a glass contains, in addition to Er3+ ions, a large concentration of Yb3+
</p>
<p>ions; the concentration can be ten times larger than the Er3+ concentration. The 2F4
level of Pr3+ coincides with the energy level 4I11/2 of Er
</p>
<p>3+. Optical pumping and
</p>
<p>resonant energy transfer from Pr3+ ions to Er3+ ions leads to population inversion
</p>
<p>in the Er3+ ion ensemble. Co-doping with ytterbium enhances the absorptivity and
</p>
<p>allows for a more efficient optical pumping. The additional doping with ytterbium
</p>
<p>has only a small influence on the energy levels of the Er3+ ions.
</p>
<p>&bull; 2.8-&micro;m erbium-doped fiber laser (Pr3+/Er3+ fiber laser). The laser is pumped
</p>
<p>via Pr3+ ions. Above a concentration of about 1.5%, an excited Er3+ ion can
</p>
<p>transfer the excitation energy to a neighboring excited Er3+ ion by an upconversion
</p>
<p>process, leading to population of 4I9/2 states (Fig. 15.10b). Laser radiation is due
</p>
<p>to 4I9/2 &rarr;
4I11/2 transitions.
</p>
<p>&bull; 2-&micro;m thulium-doped fiber laser (Tm3+ fiber laser). Pumping results in popula-
</p>
<p>tion of 3H4 levels (Fig. 15.11, left).Cross relaxation leads to population of
3F4
</p>
<p>levels; in a cross relaxation process, excitation energy is transferred to a neighbor-
</p>

</p>
<p>&bull; 2.1-&micro;m and 2.9-&micro;m Ho3+ doped fiber laser. Pumping is possible with radiation
</p>
<p>at 1.15 &micro;m. The two laser transitions make use of the three lowest energy levels,
</p>
<p>namely the 5I8 (ground state), the
5I7, and
</p>
<p>5I8 states of Ho
3+.
</p>
<p>We mention the energy transfer processes:
</p>
<p>&bull; Resonant energy transfer.
</p>
<p>&bull; Upconversion.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cross relaxation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Phonon-assisted energy transfer (Chap. 18).
</p>
<p>Transfer of the excitation energy from an ion to another ion determines the micro-
</p>
<p>scopic dynamics of fiber laser media. We will treat the basis of energy transfer and
</p>
<p>the role of energy transfer processes in the microscopic dynamics of fiber media in
</p>
<p>Chap.18. The treatment of the dynamics will provide the gain coefficient.
</p>
<p>It is possible to use optically pumped fibers as amplifiers of radiation (Sect. 16.9
</p>
<p>and Chap.18). A special amplifier is the erbium-doped fiber amplifier&mdash;used in the
</p>
<p>optical communications. It is also possible to pump the active medium of an erbium-
</p>
<p>doped fiber amplifier with radiation at a wavelength (1.48 &micro;m) that is only slightly
</p>
<p>smaller than the wavelengths (1.52&ndash;1.56 &micro;m) of the range of gain (Chaps. 18 and
</p>
<p>33.4).
</p>
<p>15.8 A Short Survey of Solid State Lasers and Impurity
</p>
<p>Ions in Solids
</p>
<p>The basic solid (a crystal or a glass) of a solid state laser (Fig. 15.12) is transparent for
</p>
<p>pump and laser radiation. The solid acts as a host of impurity ions. The electric field
</p>
<p>(crystal field) at the site of an impurity ion in a crystal or in glass mainly determines
</p>
<p>the energy levels of an impurity ion.</p>

<p>Table15.5 shows a list of few host crystals and impurity ions. The maximum
</p>
<p>concentration of impurity ions in a solid depends on the properties of the both solid
</p>
<p>and the impurity ions. Maximum doping concentrations lie between 0.1% by weight
</p>
<p>(Ti3+ in Al2O3) and 26% by weight (Pr
3+ in YAG):
</p>
<p>&bull; Sapphire (Al2O3). The crystal field splitting of the 3d state of Ti
3+ and the inter-
</p>
<p>action of the electronic states with the lattice vibrations (phonons) are the basis of
</p>
<p>the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser.
</p>
<p>&bull; YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet = Y3Al5O12). This material grows in a very high
</p>
<p>crystal quality. Doping with all three-valid rare earth ions is possible. Doping ions
</p>
<p>replace Y3+ ions. The doping concentration has a value of about 1% for all but
</p>
<p>two rare earths: the doping with Pr3+ can be exceptionally high (25%) and also
</p>
<p>the doping with Yb3+ can be very high (6%).
</p>
<p>&bull; YVO4 (yttrium vanadium oxide). This host material became available in the last

<p>years as a high-quality crystalline material.

<p>304 15 Solid State Lasers
</p>
<p>Doping of a solid with impurity ions creates the basic electronic states used in
</p>
<p>active media. Another possibility is the use of color centers. The following list gives
</p>
<p>a short survey of defect centers (ions and color centers) contained in various laser
</p>
<p>media:
</p>
<p>&bull; Ions with valence electrons. The ions of the transition metals (Ti3+, Cr3+, V3+)
</p>
<p>have 3d electrons, which are strongly influenced by the crystalline electric field.
</p>
<p>The energy levels are vibronic levels.
</p>
<p>&bull; Rare earth ions. Three-valid ions (Nd3+, Er3+, Ho3+, Pr3+) as well as two-valid
</p>
<p>ions are suitable as impurity ions of laser media. The ions of the rare earths have
</p>
<p>closed external shells (5s25p6) and (internal) 4f states. A crystal field leads to
</p>
<p>a splitting of the 4f levels. The gain bandwidth of rare earth doped crystals at
</p>
<p>room temperature is of the order of 100GHz (Sect. 15.9). The rare earth ions are
</p>
<p>excited via 4f levels or other energy levels. The crystal field splitting depends on
</p>
<p>the symmetry of the site of an impurity ion in a host material and on the lattice
</p>
<p>parameters of the host. Therefore, the wavelength of laser radiation, which is due
</p>
<p>to transitions between two particular energy levels of impurity ions, depends on
</p>
<p>the host material.
</p>
<p>&bull; Color centers. There are many different color centers. A color center can be an F
</p>
<p>center, which is an electron on an empty halide ion site in an alkali halide crystal,
</p>
<p>replacing the negative ion in an ionic crystal (LiF, NaF, KF, NaCl, KCl, CsCl).
</p>
<p>However, F centers that can be produced by irradiating a crystal with X-rays are
</p>
<p>not suitable as defect centers of active media. Suitable as laser media are alkali
</p>
<p>halides that contain F+2 centers. An F
+
</p>
<p>2 center consists of two adjacent empty halide
</p>
<p>ion sites occupied with one electron. An F+2 center may be compared with an H
+
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>molecule. The electronic energy levels of an F+2 center are strongly influenced by
</p>
<p>the crystal surrounding: the electronic states of an F+2 center are vibronic states; for
</p>
<p>a discussion of vibronic lasers, see Chap.17. The color center lasers are tunable.
</p>
<p>Different host crystals lead to different emission bands in the near infrared (from
</p>
<p>0.8 to 4 &micro;m). Most of the color center lasers require cooling to liquid nitrogen
</p>
<p>temperature. Today, color center lasers cannot compete with semiconductor lasers.
</p>
<p>The lasermedium can have, as we alreadymentioned, various geometrical shapes:
</p>
<p>&bull; Circular cylindric rod. There is a temperature gradient perpendicular to the rod
</p>
<p>axis; the rod is cooled mainly via the cylindric surface. The gain factor can be
</p>
<p>large.
</p>
<p>&bull; Disk. There is a temperature gradient perpendicular to the disk axis; the disk is
</p>
<p>cooled mainly via one of the plane surfaces.
</p>
<p>&bull; Fiber; Sect. 15.7 and Chap.18.
</p>
<p>Table15.6 shows a selection of doping ions. The energy levels of the transition
</p>
<p>metals have electrons in 3d states. These are strongly influenced by the crystalline
</p>
<p>electric field giving rise to strong splitting of the energy levels and to strong vibronic
</p>
<p>sidebands (Chap. 17). A crystalline electric field splits the energy levels of a rare
</p>
<p>earth ion, too. However, the splitting energy is much smaller and vibronic sidebands
</p>
<p>are weak.</p>

</p>
<p>&bull; FreeNd3+ ion.The4f3 state splits into stateswith different total angularmomentum
</p>
<p>(quantumnumber J), due to spin&ndash;orbit interaction. The ground state is 4I9/2. Optical
</p>
<p>transitions are forbidden.
</p>
<p>&bull; Nd3+:YAG. The crystalline electric field splits a level with the quantum number
</p>
<p>J into (2J + 1)/2 sublevels (Stark splitting); a rare earth ion with an odd num-
</p>
<p>ber of 4f electrons shows a twofold degeneracy (Kramers degeneracy)&mdash;see, for
</p>
<p>instance, [121]. The splitting of the sublevels has values in the range of several
</p>
<p>meV to about 100meV [122&ndash;126]. Optical transitions are allowed due to spin&ndash;
</p>
<p>orbit interaction or due to the interplay of spin&ndash;orbit interaction and crystalline
</p>
<p>electric field. The strongest transition is a transition between a 4F3/2 sublevel and
</p>
<p>a 4I11/2 sublevel. The corresponding line (at 1.064 &micro;m) has a linewidth of 12GHz</p>

<p>&bull; Nd3+:glass. Because of the great variety of the crystal field acting on ions at dif-
</p>
<p>ferent sites in a glass, the energy of a sublevel differs strongly for ions at different
</p>
<p>sites&mdash;we obtain a continuous energy distribution of sublevels. The strongest tran-
</p>
<p>sition is again a transition between a 4F3/2 sublevel and a
4I11/2 sublevel. The
</p>
<p>corresponding line (with the center near 1.054 &micro;m) has a linewidth (7&ndash;10THz)
</p>
<p>that is large and depends on the composition of the glass.
</p>
<p>Table15.7 shows data of Nd3+:YAG and Nd3+:glass. The gain cross section of an
</p>
<p>Nd3+ ion in a glass is 40 times smaller than the gain cross section of an Nd3+ ion in

</p>
<p>15.9 Broadening of Transitions in Impurity Ions in Solids
</p>
<p>Various broadening mechanisms can be responsible for the shape of the gain profile
</p>
<p>of an active medium based on optical transitions between two levels of an impurity
</p>
<p>ion in a solid:
</p>
<p>&bull; Line broadening due to phonon Raman scattering. An electronic transition is
</p>
<p>accompanied by a phonon Raman scattering process, i.e., by inelastic scattering
</p>
<p>of a phonon during the emission of a photon (Fig. 15.14). This process is frozen
</p>
<p>out at low crystal temperature (e.g., at 4K or 77K) but is the main broadening
</p>
<p>mechanism of many transitions in impurities in crystals at room temperature.
</p>
<p>Phonon Raman scattering leads to homogeneous line broadening. Fluorescence as
</p>
<p>well as absorption line have Lorentzian shape. We can interpret the mechanism as
</p>
<p>line broadening due to elastic collisions of an atom with phonons.

<p>Examples 1.06-&micro;m line of Nd3+:YAG at room temperature; the R1 and R2 lines
</p>
<p>of ruby at room temperature.
</p>
<p>&bull; Line broadening due to the Stark effect. Due to the Stark effect, the energy levels
</p>
<p>of ions at different sites of impurity ions in a glass have an energy distribution&mdash;
</p>
<p>and the transition energies too. Phonon-assisted energy transfer processes create
</p>
<p>a quasiband of excited ions (Chap18).
</p>
<p>At low temperature, the Stark effect of impurity ions in a solid (crystal or glass)
</p>
<p>leads to inhomogeneous broadening of absorption lines. An impurity ion occupies
</p>
<p>not exactly the position of an ion that it replaces. The strength of the crystal field at
</p>
<p>different impurity ion sites is slightly different. Due to the Stark effect, the energy
</p>
<p>levels and transition energies of the ions at different sites are different. The lineshape
</p>
<p>can be Gaussian.
</p>
<p>Examples almost all lines that are due to transitions between 4f states of ions in
</p>

<p>Some Other Lasers and Laser Amplifiers
</p>
<p>We present further types of lasers: dye laser; chemical laser; X-ray laser; organic
</p>
<p>laser. And we discuss the principle of laser amplifiers. Another topic concerns optical
</p>
<p>damage.
</p>
<p>16.1 Dye Laser
</p>
<p>The dye laser was the first laser with a broad gain profile. The dye laser operates as a
</p>
<p>tunable cw laser or as picosecond laser (pulse duration &sim;1 ps). The tuning range of
</p>
<p>a dye laser is about 5% relative to the laser frequency. By the use of different dyes,
</p>
<p>the entire visible spectral range can be covered with laser radiation.
</p>
<p>The dye laser is a vibronic laser (Fig. 16.1a). Transitions involve vibronic energy
</p>
<p>levels of the ground state (S0) and of the first excited singlet state (S1). The spatial
</p>
<p>extension of a molecule in the S1 state is larger than in the S0 state. Spontaneous
</p>
<p>emission of radiation determines the lifetime (2&ndash;5 ns). The vibronic levels are due
</p>
<p>to interaction of the electronic states with molecular vibrations. Optical pumping
</p>
<p>and fast nonradiative relaxation leads to population of the S1 state. Laser radiation is
</p>
<p>generated by stimulated transitions from the lowest S1 state of excited molecules to
</p>
<p>vibronic S0 states. An optical transition is governed by the Franck&ndash;Condon principle.
</p>
<p>In a dye laser (Fig. 16.1b), the solvent (water or an alcohol) that contains the dye
</p>
<p>molecules can continuously be pressed through a nozzle leading to a jet. The laser
</p>
<p>radiation passes the jet under the Brewster angle. The laser can be optically pumped
</p>
<p>with another laser (e.g., an argon ion laser) or with a lamp.
</p>
<p>As an example of a dye molecule, we mention 7-hydroxycoumarin. The molecule
</p>
<p>has a benzene-like molecular structure (Fig. 16.1c). A corresponding laser contains
</p>
<p>coumarin solved in water (0.1 molar solution).
</p>
<p>The S0 &rarr; S1 absorption band of 7-hydroxycoumarin (Fig. 16.2) lies in the
</p>
<p>blue (450&ndash;470 nm) and the emission band in the green (580&ndash;600 nm). The fluo-
</p>
<p>rescence band (= fluorescence line) has a Gaussian-like shape. We attribute the
</p>
<p>line broadening to homogeneous broadening (Sect. 17.4). The linewidth of the

<p>Other applications of dyes. Dye molecules solved in water or in alcohol are

<p>saturable absorbers suitable for Q-switching of lasers (Sect. 12.6). Dye molecules find
</p>
<p>applications in medicine: dye molecules are suitable as markers in the photodynamic

<p>16.2 Solid State and Thin-Film Dye Laser 311
</p>
<p>16.2 Solid State and Thin-Film Dye Laser
</p>
<p>The active medium of solid state dye laser can consist of a solid matrix, for instance
</p>
<p>polymethylmethacrylate, containing dye molecules. Suitable as pump sources are
</p>
<p>semiconductor lasers or diodes.
</p>
<p>A thin-film dye laser consists of a thin film of dye molecules (embedded in a solid
</p>
<p>matrix) on a plane solid surface. A grating on the surface of the thin film can act as
</p>
<p>distributed feedback reflector (Sects. 25.4 and 34.4).
</p>
<p>16.3 Chemical Laser
</p>
<p>The basis of a chemical laser is a chemical reaction. In an HF laser, a gas discharge
</p>
<p>drives the reactions
</p>
<p>F + H2 &rarr; H + (HF)
&lowast;, (16.1)
</p>
<p>F2 + H &rarr; F + (HF)
&lowast;. (16.2)
</p>
<p>The (HF)&lowast; molecules are in excited vibrational-rotational states and emit radiation
</p>
<p>in the 3-&micro;m range by transitions between vibrational-rotational states.
</p>
<p>A chemical reaction changes the enthalpy H of a system. The two reactions
</p>
<p>described by (16.1) and (16.2) are exothermic reactions&mdash;producing reaction energy
</p>
<p>(= reaction heat ∆H ). In the first reaction, (16.1), the reaction heat is ∆H =
</p>
<p>1.3 eV/molecule (132 kJ/mole). A portion of the reaction heat is transferred to
</p>
<p>energy of excitation of vibrational-rotational states of the v = 0, 1, 2 vibrational
</p>
<p>levels (Fig. 16.3). The second reaction, (16.2), has a larger reaction heat (∆H =
</p>
<p>4.0 eV/molecule) and results in excitation of vibrational-rotational energy levels up to
</p>
<p>the v = 6 vibrational level. The population of the different vibrational-rotational lev-
</p>
<p>els is a nonequilibrium population. Therefore, many laser transitions between dif-
</p>
<p>ferent vibrational-rotational states can occur. The laser wavelengths are in the range
</p>
<p>between 2.7 and 3.3 &micro;m.

<p>312 16 Some Other Lasers and Laser Amplifiers
</p>
<p>The HF laser operates as a continuous wave laser (driven by a gas discharge) or
</p>
<p>as TEA laser. The continuous wave laser can generate radiation of a power of 10 kW.
</p>
<p>The TEA laser pulses (of about 100 ns duration) have pulse energies of several kJ.
</p>
<p>The energy of a pulse corresponds to the energy of 100 J of laser radiation that can
</p>
<p>be generated per liter of the active material.
</p>
<p>Other chemical lasers operating with other gases produce laser radiation in slightly
</p>
<p>different wavelength regions (DF, 3.5&ndash;4.5 &micro;m; HCl, 3.5&ndash;4.1 &micro;m; HBr, 4.0&ndash;4.7 &micro;m).
</p>
<p>16.4 X-Ray Laser
</p>
<p>There are first steps toward a table-top X-ray laser. Figure 16.4a shows the principle
</p>
<p>of an X-ray laser [131&ndash;133]. Two strong visible laser pulses, focused onto a titanium
</p>
<p>plate, pump an X-ray laser in a two-step excitation.
</p>
<p>&bull; A laser pulse 1 (wavelength around 600 nm; pulse energy 20 J; duration 1 ns)
</p>
<p>produces a plasma with a large concentration of Ti12+ ions; the configuration of a
</p>
<p>Ti12+ ion corresponds to a [Ne] configuration (2p6).
</p>
<p>&bull; A laser pulse 2 (frequency around 600 nm; 4J; 1 ps) excites the plasma further.
</p>
<p>Then hot electrons in the plasma produce, by electron collisions, a population
</p>
<p>inversion, giving rise to stimulated emission of X-ray pulses.
</p>
<p>In the second step, electrons collide with Ti12+ leading to excited Ti12+ ions in
</p>
<p>2p53s states (Fig. 16.4b). Transitions 3s &rarr; 2p result in laser radiation at 18.2 nm
</p>
<p>(pulse energy 30 &micro;J, repetition rate 1 s&minus;1). The 2p states decays by fast radiative
</p>
<p>transitions.
</p>
<p>X-ray lasers with other solids (Ge, Pd, Ag, etc.) generate radiation pulses at other
</p>
<p>wavelengths (6&ndash;40 nm) in the soft X-ray region.
</p>
<p>The X-ray laser presented here is a mirrorless laser, there is no feedback with a
</p>
<p>resonator. Laser radiation is generated by amplified spontaneous emission (ASE).
</p>
<p>During propagating through the plasma, spontaneously generated radiation is ampli-
</p>
<p>fied by stimulated emission of radiation.

<p>16.5 Random Laser 313
</p>
<p>16.5 Random Laser
</p>
<p>A random laser can consist of an optical powder, for example a powder of Nd3+:YAG
</p>
<p>crystallites. Due to light scattering at the powder particles, the light emitted sponta-
</p>
<p>neously is amplified by stimulated emission; for information about solid state random
</p>
<p>lasers, see [134].
</p>
<p>16.6 Optically Pumped Organic Lasers
</p>
<p>We will treat optically pumped organic lasers in a later chapter (Sect. 34.4); then we
</p>
<p>will have available concepts, described in Chap. 18 and in chapters on semiconductor
</p>
<p>lasers, that are useful to explain how gain of radiation in an organic medium can occur.
</p>
<p>16.7 Laser Tandem
</p>
<p>A laser tandem is suitable for generation of laser radiation of high beam quality.
</p>
<p>A semiconductor laser, with a high efficiency of conversion of electric power to laser
</p>
<p>radiation, pumps a solid state laser. The frequency doubled radiation of this laser
</p>
<p>pumps a third laser. A semiconductor laser has a low beam quality. The combination
</p>
<p>of both type of lasers is most favorable: the use of a semiconductor laser as pump
</p>
<p>laser of a solid state laser allows for an efficient conversion of electric energy to high
</p>
<p>quality laser radiation.
</p>
<p>Example A semiconductor laser pumps a Nd:YAG laser, then the radiation is
</p>
<p>frequency-doubled. The frequency doubled radiation finally pumps a titanium&ndash;
</p>
<p>sapphire laser.
</p>
<p>16.8 High-Power Laser Amplifier
</p>
<p>In a high-power laser system (Fig. 16.5) consisting of a laser and a laser amplifier,
</p>
<p>the laser beam is expanded by the use of a telescope in order to avoid optical damage
</p>
<p>of the active medium of the amplifier. The (single-pass) gain factor G1 of a laser
</p>
<p>amplifier can have a value of the order of 10. By the use of laser amplifiers in
</p>
<p>series, very large power levels can be obtained. Table 16.1 shows data of three high-
</p>
<p>power laser systems (tp = pulse duration; Wp = pulse energy; P = pulse power;
</p>
<p>νrep = repetition rate).

<p>&bull; Neodymiumglass laser amplifier. By amplification of a light pulse of a neodymium-
</p>
<p>doped glass laser with glass laser amplifiers, a pulse of extremely high pulse energy
</p>
<p>can be generated. The beam emitted by a glass laser is widened and amplified by
</p>
<p>a first amplifier, then widened and amplified by a second amplifier and so on.
</p>
<p>(It is possible to produce glass in cylinders of large diameter.) A radiation pulse
</p>
<p>generated by a laser amplifier system (or pulses generated by systems in parallel),
</p>
<p>focused on a target containing deuterium and tritium can heat up the target to a
</p>
<p>temperature at which nuclear fusion processes can occur (laser fusion); a laser
</p>
<p>pulse can produce a plasma of a temperature of the order of 100 million degrees.
</p>
<p>16.9 Fiber Amplifier
</p>
<p>Fiber amplifiers consisting of glass doped with rare earth ions are suitable for ampli-
</p>
<p>fication of radiation in the 1&ndash;3 &micro;m range; fiber amplifiers make use of the same rare
</p>
<p>earth-doped glasses as fiber lasers (Sect. 15.7 and Chap. 18). By the use of amplifiers,
</p>
<p>radiation at kW power levels can be generated.
</p>
<p>The erbium-doped fiber amplifier&mdash;that is of great importance for long-distance
</p>
<p>optical communications&mdash;will be treated in Chap. 18.
</p>
<p>16.10 Optical Damage
</p>
<p>A strong radiation field in a transparent solid material can lead to optical damage.
</p>
<p>Different materials have different damage thresholds. The damage threshold of a
</p>
<p>material depends strongly on the wavelength of the radiation. The damage threshold
</p>
<p>is orders of magnitude larger for pulses of 10 fs duration than for pulses of 1 ns</p>

</p>
<p>duration. Accordingly, the optical-damage threshold can have values between 10 kW
</p>
<p>per cm (or smaller) and 20 MW per cm.
</p>
<p>Optical damage can be caused by interband transitions of electrons and subse-
</p>
<p>quent impact ionization processes [135, 136]. An interband transition in a crystal
</p>
<p>in a strong electromagnetic field can be due to a multiphoton transition. Interband
</p>
<p>transitions excite electrons into the conduction band. Subsequently, the electrons in
</p>
<p>the conduction band gain energy by absorption processes, i.e., due to acceleration
</p>
<p>of the conduction electrons by the optical field. Highly excited conduction electrons
</p>
<p>excite, by impact ionization, further electrons from the valence band to the conduc-
</p>
<p>tion band. The impact ionization is an avalanche process that can lead to optical
</p>
<p>breakdown associated with crystal damage.
</p>
<p>16.11 Gain Units
</p>
<p>The power of a light beam that traverses an amplifier increases from P0 to P . We can
</p>
<p>characterize the increase in different ways, assuming that the gain does not change
</p>
<p>along the path of the beam:
</p>
<p>&bull; G = P/P0 = gain factor.
</p>
<p>&bull; G = eαL , where α is the gain coefficient (in m&minus;1) and L (in m) the length of the
</p>
<p>gain medium.
</p>
<p>&bull; 1 dB (= 1 dB) = 10 &times; log(P/P0) = 10 &times; 0.43 &times; αL = 4.3 &times; αL .
</p>
<p>&bull; (1 B = 1 Bel = 10 dB).
</p>
<p>&bull; 1 dB/m = L&minus;1 &times; 10 &times; log(P/P0) = 4.3α.
</p>
<p>&bull; 1 dB m = 1 dB mW = 1 dB &times; 1 mW = a unit of gain of an amplifier.
</p>
<p>Example erbium fiber amplifier; α = 0.5 m&minus;1 and L = 14 m; gain = 2.15 dB/m;

<p>G = 103.

<p>Vibronic Medium
</p>
<p>We study the origin of gain of radiation in a vibronic medium. We find that the
</p>
<p>gain coefficient of a vibronic medium like optically pumped titanium-sapphire has
</p>
<p>a Gaussian-like shape.
</p>
<p>We introduce a one-dimensional model of a vibronic medium that illustrates the
</p>
<p>occurrence of vibronic transitions and we describe the results of theoretical investiga-
</p>
<p>tions. The energy of an atomic state of a vibronic medium, i.e., the energy of a vibronic
</p>
<p>state, is composed of electronic energy of an impurity ion and of vibrational energy
</p>
<p>of the host crystal. The broad frequency distribution of lattice vibrations (phonons)
</p>
<p>of a crystal together with the possibility that many phonons can be involved in an
</p>
<p>optical transition lead to two broad vibronic sidebands of the zero-phonon line. One
</p>
<p>of the bands is observable as absorption band and the other as fluorescence band.
</p>
<p>In a laser, the absorption band is used for optical pumping and the other band for
</p>
<p>stimulated transitions.
</p>
<p>In a classical description of vibronic transitions, we make use of the classical
</p>
<p>oscillator model of an atom to describe the electronic transition in an impurity ion
</p>
<p>and attribute a vibronic transition to an atomic oscillation experiencing frequency
</p>
<p>modulation by a vibration of the host crystal.
</p>
<p>A vibronic laser like the titanium-sapphire laser is based on a homogeneous broad-
</p>
<p>ening mechanism, which determines the optical transitions.
</p>
<p>17.1 Model of a Vibronic System
</p>
<p>We first illustrate, by the use of a simple model, the origin of vibronic coupling.
</p>
<p>We consider a TiO2 molecule (Fig. 17.1a); x0 is the TiO distance. We describe the
</p>
<p>potential of the 3d electron of the Ti3+ ion in a TiO2 molecule by a one-dimensional
</p>
<p>square well potential of infinite height (Fig. 17.1b). We make use of the Schr&ouml;dinger

<p>The symmetric valence vibration of the TiO molecule causes a variation of the

<p>17.2 Gain Coefficient of a Vibronic Medium

<p>Vibronic systems have been studied in detail by the use of appropriate quan-

<p>tum mechanical methods [137]. The configuration diagram (Fig. 17.3a) illustrates
</p>
<p>the role of lattice vibrations. The configuration coordinate Q replaces x of our

<p>ions if Ti3+ is in its electronic ground state. Q&lowast;0 describes the distance if Ti
3+ is
</p>
<p>excited. Q &minus; Q0 is a measure of the displacement due to lattice vibrations; the con-
</p>
<p>figuration coordinate takes into account that a large number of lattice vibrations
</p>
<p>(phonons) of a crystal can couple to an electronic transition.
</p>
<p>We discuss the gain coefficient of Ti3+:Al2O3 at zero temperature. We make use
</p>
<p>of results obtained for vibronic transitions in Cr3+:Al2O3 [137]. We assume that
</p>
<p>Ti3+:Al2O3 shows a similar vibronic coupling strength as Cr
3+:Al2O3 as a compari-
</p>
<p>son of the widths of the vibronic absorption bands suggests. Both Ti3+ and Cr3+ are
</p>
<p>transition metal ions; Ti3+ has one electron and Cr3+ two electrons in the 3d shell.
</p>
<p>If the E(Q &minus; Q0) and E
&lowast;(Q &minus; Q&lowast;0) curves have parabolic slopes (Fig. 17.3a),
</p>
<p>the gain coefficient α(ν) is expected to have a Gaussian shape. Optical pumping
</p>
<p>leads to a population of the lowest excited-state level. Gain is due to transitions to
</p>
<p>vibronic levels of the ground state. The maximum of the gain curve corresponds,
</p>
<p>with respect to a single emission process, to emission of a photon and creation of
</p>
<p>about ten phonons of an average frequency of 7.5 THz. The halfwidth of the gain
</p>
<p>curve is about 10 times the average phonon energy. The density of states D1(νvib)
</p>
<p>of the phonons of Al2O3 extends from νvib = 0 to a maximum vibrational frequency
</p>
<p>hνmax of about 15 THz. The Gaussian shape of the gain curve reflects the Gaussian
</p>
<p>shape of the wave function of the lowest excited state (Fig. 17.3b). According to the
</p>
<p>Franck&ndash;Condon principle, the distance does not change during an optical transition
</p>
<p>from the excited state to a vibronic state of the electronic ground state.
</p>
<p>In an optically pumped crystal at room temperature, transitions occur also from
</p>
<p>thermally populated vibronic states (Fig. 17.4a). The population is determined by the
</p>
<p>crystal temperature. Because of additional transitions, in comparison with low tem-
</p>
<p>perature, the gain curve shifts to higher energy and the halfwidth is larger than at low
</p>
<p>temperature (by a factor of 1.2 according to theory [137]). Figure 17.4b shows the
</p>
<p>E(Q &minus; Q0) and E
&lowast;(Q &minus; Q&lowast;0) curves together with the shape of the gain coefficient
</p>
<p>α. The gain coefficient has a Gaussian shape. Due to anharmonicity of the lattice
</p>
<p>vibrations, the E(Q &minus; Q0) deviates from a parabolic shape at Q &gt; Q0 (dashed). This
</p>
<p>is most likely the main reason of the deviation of the gain curve from a Gaussian</p>

</p>
<p>ring at room temperature, can lead to a broadening of the gain curve; the halfwidth
</p>
<p>(110 THz), derived from fluorescence data (Sect. 7.6), corresponds to about 15 times
</p>
<p>the average energy of a phonon in Al2O3.
</p>
<p>While the gain curve deviates from a Gaussian shape at small frequencies, the
</p>
<p>experimental absorption curve deviates at large frequencies (see Fig. 7.8). This is
</p>
<p>in accordance with a deviation (Fig. 17.4, dotted) of the shape of the E&lowast;(Q &minus; Q&lowast;0)
</p>
<p>curve from a parabolic shape due to anharmonicity for Q &lt; Q&lowast;0. A structure in the
</p>
<p>absorption line, indicated in Fig. 7.8, is due to a splitting&mdash;caused by the Jahn-Teller
</p>
<p>effect [138]. The Jahn-Teller effect is most likely responsible that the absorption
</p>
<p>cross section of a Ti3+ ion in the ground state is by about a factor of 4 smaller than
</p>
<p>the gain cross section of an excited Ti3+ ion (see Fig. 5.3, upper part).
</p>
<p>The maximum quantum efficiency of titanium-doped sapphire is about 80% [139].

<p>Chapter 18
</p>
<p>Amplification of Radiation
</p>
<p>in a Doped Glass Fiber
</p>
<p>We study the dynamics of gain of fiber amplifiers and fiber lasers. We present a
</p>
<p>model&mdash;the quasiband model&mdash;that allows for derivation of an analytical expression
</p>
<p>for the gain coefficient of an optically pumped doped glass fiber. We concentrate
</p>
<p>the discussion mainly on the erbium-doped fiber amplifier. We will however discuss
</p>
<p>other fiber amplifiers and fiber lasers too.
</p>
<p>A glass fiber of the worldwide optical fiber network contains, about every 50 km,
</p>
<p>an erbium-doped fiber amplifier. This amplifier operates in a frequency band (width
</p>
<p>&sim;5 THz) around 195 THz (1.54 &micro;m). It is possible to pump the erbium-doped fiber
amplifier with radiation of a semiconductor laser at a frequency (&sim;202 THz) that
lies just outside the range of gain. Alternatively, pumping with radiation at a much
</p>
<p>larger frequency is possible.
</p>
<p>While an excited atom in a gas, a liquid, or a crystal keeps its excitation until a
</p>
<p>stimulated emission process takes place, the situation is completely different for a
</p>
<p>fiber glass medium. In a glass, an excited ion loses its excitation to another ion and
</p>
<p>this to a third ion and so on&mdash;the excitation migrates within the glass. The origin of the
</p>
<p>migration of excitation are phonon-assisted energy transfer processes. An excitation
</p>
<p>travels over a very large number of ions before a stimulated emission process takes
</p>
<p>place. The migration of excitation plays an essential role in the dynamics of gain
</p>
<p>of radiation in fiber amplifiers. We will introduce a model (quasiband model) that
</p>
<p>takes account of the migration of energy and that enables us to calculate the gain
</p>
<p>coefficient of a fiber.
</p>
<p>We will begin this chapter with a short survey of the erbium-doped fiber amplifier:
</p>
<p>we first describe the gain coefficient and the quasiband model. Later in the chapter,
</p>
<p>we will justify the model and derive the gain coefficient. In the last section of the
</p>
<p>chapter, we will show that the quasiband model is in accord with experimental results
</p>
<p>of absorption, fluorescence, and gain measurements. We will also discuss three-level
</p>
<p>laser models often used for description of fiber lasers and amplifiers.

<p>326 18 Amplification of Radiation in a Doped Glass Fiber
</p>
<p>18.1 Survey of the Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier
</p>
<p>Figure 18.1 shows the gain coefficient of an erbium-doped fiber amplifier; the gain
</p>
<p>coefficient was calculated (Sect. 18.6) under the assumption that&sim;60% of the erbium
ions are in the excited state. The amplifier operates in a wavelength range near
</p>
<p>1.54 &micro;m (frequency 195 THz); see also Table 18.1. The gain bandwidth of about
</p>
<p>40 nm (&sim;5 THz) corresponds to &sim;2.5% of the center frequency. Radiation of a
semiconductor laser serves as pump laser (pump wavelength 1.48 &micro;m, frequency
</p>
<p>&sim;203 THz). According to the small difference between pump and laser wavelength,
it is possible to reach a high quantum efficiency of conversion of pump radiation to
</p>
<p>laser radiation. The model of a glass fiber amplifier, presented in this chapter, has
</p>
<p>been published in 2010 [145].
</p>
<p>We begin with mentioning few data of an erbium-doped fiber amplifier:

density of 2.3 &times; 1028 m&minus;3.

</p>
<p>Figure 18.2 illustrates the principle of the erbium-doped fiber amplifier (=Er3+:
glass amplifier) as we will explain in the following sections. Pump radiation cre-
</p>
<p>ates excited-impurity quasiparticles in a quasiband via optical transitions from a
</p>
<p>vacuum level to the upper part of the quasiband. Stimulated emission of radiation
</p>
<p>by transitions from the lower part of the quasiband to the vacuum level gives rise to
</p>
<p>amplification of radiation. The width (&sim;50 meV) of the quasiband is small compared
to the center energy (819 meV); the width of the quasiband depends on the type of
</p>
<p>glass and differs by a factor 2&ndash;3 for glasses of different composition. Pumping via
</p>
<p>higher levels has already been discussed (see Fig. 15.10a).
</p>
<p>The erbium-doped fiber laser at room temperature is a quasiband laser (Sect. 4.3)&mdash;
</p>
<p>the intraband relaxation time (10&minus;13 s) is much smaller than the relaxation time of
</p>
<p>energy levels with respect to relaxation to the ground state (τ &lowast;rel = 10&minus;2 s). Intraband
relaxation is a nonradiative relaxation. Population inversion occurs if the occupation
</p>
<p>number difference is larger than zero, f2 &minus; f1 &gt; 0. Because the halfwidth of the
quasiband is comparable to kT , population inversion requires that about half of the
</p>
<p>erbium ions are in the excited state (Sect. 18.6).</p>

</p>
<p>18.2 Energy Levels of Erbium Ions in Glass
</p>
<p>and Quasiband Model
</p>
<p>An energy level of a free Er3+ ion (Fig. 18.3) is characterized by the quantum number
</p>
<p>J of the total angular momentum; J= 15/2 in the ground state (4I15/2) and J= 13/2 in
the first excited state (4I13/2). A crystalline electric field splits a level into a multiplet
</p>
<p>of J + 1/2 sublevels; because of Kramers degeneracy [121], a state with an odd J does
not experience the complete lifting of the 2J + 1 fold degeneracy. The splitting of
the ground state level is larger than the splitting of the excited-state level as indicated
</p>
<p>in the figure for Er3+ ions in a LaF3 crystal [146, 147].
</p>
<p>In a glass, the Er3+ ions are randomly distributed on sites of different crystalline
</p>
<p>electric field. Boltzmann&rsquo;s statistics determines the occupancy of the sublevels of
</p>
<p>an ion; thermal equilibrium of the sublevel population of an ion is established via
</p>
<p>spin-lattice relaxation; at room temperature, nonradiative relaxation by spin-lattice
</p>
<p>relaxation processes lead to a fast establishment of thermal equilibrium in an erbium-
</p>
<p>doped glass as long as pump radiation is absent.
</p>
<p>Multiplet splitting and crystal field variations suggest widths of energy distri-
</p>
<p>butions (&sim;50 meV for the ground state levels and &sim;25 meV for the excited-state
levels), which are of the order of kT at room temperature (T = temperature; k =
Boltzmann&rsquo;s constant). In a laser medium consisting of a doped crystal, an excited
</p>
<p>ion loses its excitation energy mainly via a stimulated optical transition. But in a
</p>
<p>doped-glass medium, an ion excited via a pump process transfers its excitation to
</p>
<p>another ion, this again to another ion and so on. On average, a laser transition process
</p>
<p>occurs only after 1011 transfer processes.
</p>
<p>As an example of a glass, we discuss a quartz glass (=SiO2 glass). A two-
dimensional structural model (Fig. 18.4) illustrates the structure of glass. The SiO2
glass consists of silicon ion and oxygen ions. The silicon and oxygen ions do not form

</p>
<p>a periodic structure: the Si-O distance varies within the glass and the atomic arrange-
</p>
<p>ment shows no symmetry. Er3+ ions occupy different sites and therefore experience
</p>
<p>different crystal line fields. The energy of the ground state level, the energy of the
</p>
<p>excited state level, as well as the transition energy are different for erbium ions at
</p>
<p>different sites.
</p>
<p>To discuss the role of energy transfer, we describe, for simplicity, an Er3+ ion as a
</p>
<p>two-level atomic system consisting of a ground state level and an excited-state level.
</p>
<p>An excited two-level system at site (i) with a transition energy Ei can transfer its
</p>
<p>excitation to a neighboring unexcited two-level system at site (j) that has a transition
</p>
<p>energy Ej (Fig. 18.5, left). The energies of the ground state levels differ by δij. Energy
</p>
<p>conservation in a phonon assisted energy transfer process requires that
</p>
<p>Ei + hνp1 = Ej + hνp2 + δij, (18.2)
</p>
<p>where νp1 is the frequency of a phonon and νp2 is the frequency of another phonon.
</p>
<p>The energy transfer rate depends on the concentration of impurity ions and the
</p>
<p>temperature of the glass. In the reverse process (Fig. 18.5, right), the sum of the
</p>
<p>energy of excitation of the ion at site (j), the energy of a phonon, and the energy of
</p>
<p>position is transferred to energy of excitation of ion (i) and of another phonon.
</p>
<p>Energy transfer processes between rare earth ions in a glass at room tempera-
</p>
<p>ture, with involvement of two phonons, first discussed in theoretical investigations
</p>
<p>[148, 149], are very efficient as experimental studies indicated [150, 151]. The micro-
</p>
<p>scopic process of energy transfer can be due to Coulomb interaction between two
</p>
<p>impurity ions.
</p>
<p>Besides the two-phonon-assisted energy transfer, there are other energy transfer
</p>
<p>processes: resonant energy transfer (without the involvement of a phonon); energy</p>

</p>
<p>Ec is the center and ∆E the halfwidth of the distribution.
</p>
<p>Because of the phonon-assisted energy transfer processes, the quasiparticles inter-
</p>
<p>act with each other and couple to the thermal bath. The coupling to the thermal bath
</p>
<p>gives rise to the formation of a thermal equilibrium of the population in the quasi-
</p>
<p>band (Fig. 18.7). At steady state, the average number of quasiparticles is constant.
</p>
<p>Continuous optical pumping compensates the loss of quasiparticles that is due to
</p>
<p>relaxation (mainly caused by spontaneous emission of radiation) and due to the net
</p>
<p>effect of stimulated emission and absorption of radiation.
</p>
<p>Our model does not take into account that the ground state as well as the excited
</p>
<p>state of a single Er3+ ion are multiplets (due to crystal field splitting). Without
</p>
<p>pumping, the population in a multiplet of the ground state is in thermal equilibrium.
</p>
<p>This equilibrium is established via spin-lattice relaxation processes. During optical

<p>pumping, the ensemble of occupied ground state levels is not in a thermal equilibrium.

<p>Quasiparticles
</p>
<p>An energy level of the quasiband is, according to the Pauli principle, either empty or

<p>occupied with one quasiparticle. We apply to the ensemble of quasiparticles Fermi&rsquo;s

</p>
<p>N is the density of quasiparticles. The probability to find a quasiparticle in a level of
</p>
<p>energy E is f2(E). The probability that the ground state level, which corresponds to
</p>
<p>the excited-state level of energy E , is occupied, is f1 = 1 &minus; f2.
We introduce dimensionless variables x = E/kT , a = EF/kT , b = Ec/kT ,w =

</p>
<p>If b ≫ 1 (Ec ≫ kT ), which is the case for glass amplifiers and lasers, a numerical
analysis of (18.7) yields a quasi-Fermi energy that does not depend on w; the integral
</p>
<p>is finite only in a small range of x around b and zero otherwise. The quasi-Fermi
</p>
<p>energy EF (Fig. 18.8) increases with increasing filling factor N/N0 and is equal to
</p>
<p>Ec at half filling; EF is &minus;&infin; at zero quasiband filling (N = 0) and +&infin; at complete
filling (N = N0). The quasi-Fermi energy EF depends linearly on N/N0 in a large
range of the filling factor,

<p>EF = Ec + 4.44 &times; (N/N0 &minus; 0.5) kT . (18.8)
</p>
<p>Figure 18.9 shows the occupation number difference f2 &minus; f1 for quasiparticles at
the center of the quasiband (E = Ec). The occupation number difference is &minus;1 for
N = 0. With increasing N , f2 &minus; f1 increases, becomes zero at half filling of the qua-
siband and increases further. At complete filling (N = N0), the occupation number
difference is unity. The occupation number difference shows a linear dependence on

<p>At the center of the quasiband, the occupation number difference (see Fig. 18.9)

</p>
<p>The linear dependence of the occupation number difference on the filling factor, for
</p>
<p>E = Ec, appears to be characteristic for a Gaussian shape of the density of states of
the quasiband; there are only small deviations from the linear dependence, occurring
</p>
<p>at N/N0 near 0 and 1. The linear slope is slightly (11%) larger than for an ensemble
</p>
<p>of two-level systems that all have the same transition energy. We will show that
</p>
<p>f2 &minus; f1 &ge; 0 corresponds to gain and f2 &minus; f1 &le; 0 to absorption.
A Fourier expansion of f2(E) around Ec indicates that the linear dependence of
</p>
<p>the occupation number difference f2(Ec)&minus; f1 on N/N0 follows directly from the
linear dependence of the quasi-Fermi energy EF on N/N0 (Problem 18.3). The linear

factor than the linear dependence of the quasi-Fermi energy.

<p>the quasiband. After the formation of a quasithermal equilibrium, the excited two-
</p>
<p>level atomic systems still interact with phonons. Accordingly, each upper level is
</p>
<p>energetically broadened due to energy transfer processes. The width of a broadened
</p>
<p>energy level is δE &asymp; �/τin, where τin is the scattering time, i.e., the time between
two energy transfer events. The scattering time τin depends on temperature. At room
</p>
<p>temperature, the occupation number of thermal phonons is large at phonon ener-
</p>
<p>gies kT &sim;25 meV. Thus, a few energy transfer events (per excited two-level system)
establish a quasiequilibrium after a few scattering events. Therefore, we regard τin
as the intraband relaxation time.
</p>
<p>The intraband relaxation time (&sim;10&minus;13 s) of Er3+:glass at room temperature is
much shorter than the lifetime (of the order of 10 ms) of an upper level with respect
</p>
<p>to spontaneous emission of a photon. The width of the broadening of an upper level,

<p>18.6 Calculation of the Gain Coefficient of a Doped Fiber 337
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.12 Gain coefficient at different band filling factors N/N0 (in steps of 0.1)
</p>
<p>Under the assumption that B21 is the same for all two-level systems and does
</p>
<p>therefore not depend on E , the peak gain coefficient is
</p>
<p>αp = (n/c)hνc B̄21 D(Ec). (18.28)
</p>
<p>Then the slope of the gain coefficient curves is given by the simple expression
</p>
<p>α(ν)/αp = f2 &minus; f1 = 2 f2(E)&minus; 1; E = hν. (18.29)
</p>
<p>Gain coefficient curves (Fig. 18.12) show that the range of gain increases with
</p>
<p>increasing quasiband filling according to the increase of the frequency
</p>
<p>νF = EF/h. (18.30)
</p>
<p>The frequency νF is a transparency frequency. At complete filling, the gain coefficient
</p>
<p>has the same slope as the density of states and reaches the peak gain coefficient αp at
</p>
<p>the center frequency νc = Ec/h. If the quasiband is empty, the absorption coefficient
has the same profile as the density of states.
</p>
<p>From the peak gain coefficient, we obtain a peak gain cross section according to
</p>
<p>the relation
</p>
<p>αp = N0 σp. (18.31)

<p>The gain coefficient (at a filling factor of 0.6) is positive below a frequency that

<p>18.7 Different Effective Gain Cross Sections
</p>
<p>Here, we introduce three different effective gain cross sections: effective gain cross
</p>
<p>section σ ; effective gain cross section σ̄eff ; effective gain cross section σeff .
</p>
<p>Figure 18.15 shows gain coefficients (solid lines) at different quasiband filling

<p>factors. The maximum gain coefficient αmax (dashed) depends on the filling factor.

<p>We can relate the maximum gain coefficient and the density of quasiparticles (i.e.,

<p>the density of excited ions),
</p>
<p>αmax = N σ ; (18.37)
</p>
<p>the effective gain cross section σ (Fig. 18.6, dashed) increases with increasing filling
</p>
<p>factor, from zero for the empty quasiband to σp at complete quasiband filling.

</p>
<p>σ̄eff = (dαmax/dN )N/N0 (18.38)

</p>
<p>cross section σ̄eff (Fig. 18.16, solid line) increases from zero near N/N0 = 0, shows
a maximum (&sim;2σp) for N/N0 &sim; 0.6, then decreases and approaches zero near
N/N0 = 1.
</p>
<p>We can introduce another effective gain cross section, σeff , writing
</p>
<p>α(νc) &asymp; 2.22(N/N0 &minus; 1/2)(n/c)hν B̄21 D(Ec) = (N &minus; N0/2) σeff (18.39)
</p>
<p>and find
</p>
<p>σeff &asymp; 2.22 (n/c)hν B̄21 D(Ec) = 2.22 σp. (18.40)
</p>
<p>The effective gain cross section σeff (Fig. 18.16, dotted) has a constant value (2.22
</p>
<p>σp) over a large range of the filling factor, from N/N0 = 0.5 to nearly N/N0 = 1,
where it decreases to 2σp. At complete filling, σeff = 2σp; the factor 2 is due to the
different reference values, N/N0 &minus; 0.5 an N , respectively. At smaller band filling,
σeff exceeds 2σp because band filling in the center of the quasiband leads to stronger
</p>
<p>gain than filling in the wing of the band for N/N0 &rarr; 1.
The effective gain cross section
</p>
<p>σeff = (dα/dN ) (18.41)
</p>
<p>describes, for radiation of frequency νc, the gain cross section related to the two-
</p>
<p>level systems that are excited above half filling; N0/2 is the transparency density for
</p>
<p>radiation of frequency νc.
</p>
<p>Here, we can ask: does the gain coefficient curve show a narrowing near complete
</p>
<p>quasiband filling, i.e., when almost all erbium ions (for instance 90%) are in the
</p>
<p>excited state? In this case, the energy transfer processes strongly slow, particularly
</p>
<p>in the wings of the quasiband.</p>

<p>ᾱabs = αabs(ν)/αp = f1 &minus; f2 = 1 &minus; 2 f2(E), (18.42)
</p>

<p>S̄ν(ν) = Sν(ν)/Sν,p = f2(E); E = hν. (18.43)
</p>
<p>Sν(ν) is the spectral distribution of the fluorescence radiation. Sν,p is the peak inten-

<p>sity, namely the intensity at the frequency νc in the case of complete quasiband
</p>
<p>filling. We neglect the frequency dependence of the Einstein coefficient of sponta-
</p>
<p>neous emission.
</p>
<p>Figure 18.17 shows an absorption curve and a fluorescence curve both for week

<p>quasiband filling (N/N0 = 0.1). The absorption curve is slightly blue-shifted with
respect to the absorption curve for zero quasiband filling. The fluorescence curve is
</p>
<p>red-shifted. The absorption and the fluorescence curves have different shapes. The
</p>
<p>shapes of the curves as well as the frequencies of their maxima depend on the filling
</p>
<p>factor.
</p>
<p>The filling factor relates the absorption coefficient and the shape of the fluores-

</p>
<p>In this case, the shape of the fluorescence curve is determined by the product of the
</p>
<p>Fermi&ndash;Dirac distribution function and the absorption coefficient.
</p>
<p>It is possible to modify the quasiparticle model taking into account that B21 can
</p>
<p>have different values for ions at different sites in a glass and that the density of states
</p>
<p>does not have a Gaussian shape. An analysis of absorption and fluorescence spectra
</p>
<p>measured for different filling factors N/N0 (and different sample temperatures) may
</p>
<p>provide detailed information on B21(ν) and D(ν).
</p>
<p>There remains the question how to take account of the multiplet splitting, espe-
</p>
<p>cially of the occupied sublevels of the ground state. During optical pumping, the
</p>
<p>population of the ensemble of sublevels of the nonexcited ions is not in thermal

<p>18.9 Experimental Studies and Models of Doped Fiber
</p>
<p>Media
</p>
<p>The gain coefficient curves at different filling factors (see Fig. 18.12) and the absolute
</p>
<p>values of the gain coefficients (see Fig. 18.1) are, in principle, in accord with exper-
</p>
<p>imental results. However, experimental studies of the shape of absorption curves,
</p>
<p>gain curves, and fluorescence curves of erbium-doped fibers indicate the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; The profiles of absorption spectra and of fluorescence spectra are non-Gaussian
[154]; this shows that the densities of states of quasiparticles have non-Gaussian
</p>
<p>profiles and that&mdash;most likely&mdash;B21 does not have a constant value.
</p>
<p>&bull; The profiles depend on the composition of a fiber glass; fibers can consist of various
types of glasses (silicate, phosphate, germanite, fluorite, fluorozirconate glass).
</p>
<p>&bull; The fluorescence spectrum is red-shifted relative to the absorption spectrum&mdash;in
accord with the results (see Fig. 18.17) obtained with the quasiparticle model.
</p>
<p>We mention two other models that are mostly used to describe fluorescence,
</p>
<p>absorption, and gain curves of fiber media:
</p>
<p>&bull; Three-level laser model (Fig. 18.18a). It describes gain and absorption of an
erbium-doped fiber amplifier [155, 156]; numerical simulations provide gain coef-
</p>
<p>ficient curves that show a similar behavior as the gain curves (Fig. 18.12) obtained
</p>
<p>by the analytical expression (18.29).
</p>
<p>&bull; Three-level laser medium of the ruby laser type (Fig. 18.18b). It describes ampli-
fiers and lasers, which are strongly pumped via high-lying pump levels [157, 158].</p>

<p>These models assume a quasithermal equilibrium of the population of the ground
</p>
<p>state levels. Although the assumption is not fully justified, the models provide a basis
</p>
<p>of the description of optical properties of a fiber.
</p>

<p>In a free-electron laser (FEL), free-electrons of a velocity near the speed of light are
</p>
<p>passing through a periodic transverse magnetic field. Due to the Lorentz force, the
</p>
<p>electrons perform oscillations (free-electron oscillations) with displacements trans-
</p>
<p>verse to the propagation direction. Stimulated emission of radiation by the oscillating
</p>
<p>electrons is the origin of free-electron laser radiation. The frequency of the radiation
</p>
<p>increases quadratically with the electron energy. Frequency tuning over a large fre-
</p>
<p>quency range is possible by changing the electron energy; the range of the electron
</p>
<p>energy is determined by the particle accelerator that produces an external electron
</p>
<p>beam used to operate a free-electron laser.
</p>
<p>Infrared and far infrared free-electron lasers generate pulses of radiation of high
</p>
<p>power; one type of the presently operating far infrared free-electron lasers generates
</p>
<p>quasi-continuous radiation.
</p>
<p>Single-pass free-electron lasers, i.e., mirrorless lasers, are able to generate optical
</p>
<p>pulses of extremely large pulse power. An important single-pass free-electron laser
</p>
<p>is the SASE (self-amplified spontaneous emission) free-electron laser. It generates
</p>
<p>optical pulses by amplification of spontaneously emitted radiation. X-ray SASE free-
</p>
<p>electron lasers are successfully applied in many fields.
</p>
<p>The equation of motion of an electron traversing a spatially periodic magnetic
</p>
<p>field provides the oscillation frequency (resonance frequency) ω0 of the free-electron
</p>
<p>oscillation; ω0 depends on the energy of the electron as well as on the period and the
</p>
<p>strength of the magnetic field.
</p>
<p>Classical theory describes the dynamics of a free-electron laser by using Maxwell&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>equations together with classical laws for the generation of radiation by moving
</p>
<p>charges. Translational energy of electrons is converted to energy of optical radiation.
</p>
<p>Gain for radiation occurs at frequencies slightly below ω0. Theory shows that the
</p>
<p>amplitude of the high frequency electric field in a free-electron laser medium is lim-
</p>
<p>ited; even if the high frequency field in a laser resonator has no loss, the field cannot
</p>
<p>exceed a saturation field&mdash;conventional lasers do not have such a limitation. Numer-

<p>ical simulations provide solutions of Maxwell&rsquo;s equations that allow for complete
</p>
<p>characterization of a free-electron laser.
</p>
<p>This chapter contains an introduction to free-electron lasers. Instead of applying
</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s theory, we present a model of the free-electron laser, which we call mod-
</p>
<p>ulation model of the free-electron laser. The transverse oscillation of an electron at
</p>
<p>the frequency ω0 is joined with a transverse current at ω0. The modulation model
</p>
<p>describes the interaction of an electron with a high frequency electric field of fre-
</p>
<p>quency ω as a phase modulation of the oscillation of the electron. Phase modulation
</p>
<p>results in another current, the modulation current at the frequency ω. The modula-
</p>
<p>tion leads, in an ensemble of electrons, to a modulation current density that mediates
</p>
<p>gain for the high frequency electric field; energy of translation of the electrons is
</p>
<p>transferred to energy of the high frequency electric field. An ensemble of electrons
</p>
<p>represent the active medium in a free-electron laser. The modulation model contains
</p>
<p>a numerical parameter, which is a measure of the strength of interaction of the elec-
</p>
<p>tron oscillation and the high frequency electric field. We choose the parameter by
</p>
<p>comparison with experimental data of free-electron lasers. The modulation model
</p>
<p>provides analytical expressions for the saturation field amplitude and for the gain
</p>
<p>coefficient of the free-electron laser medium. The model allows, furthermore, for an
</p>
<p>analysis of the onset of oscillation, with the onset being initiated by radiation spon-
</p>
<p>taneously emitted by oscillating electrons. The modulation model illustrates main
</p>
<p>properties of a free-electron laser. According to the modulation model, saturation
</p>
<p>of the amplitude of high frequency electric field is due to a transition of the active
</p>
<p>medium from a state of gain to a state in which absorption compensates stimulated
</p>
<p>emission of radiation.
</p>
<p>We attribute, additionally, discrete energy levels, namely an energy-ladder system,
</p>
<p>to an oscillating electron; the energy levels are equidistant and have a next near
</p>
<p>energy level distance of �ω0. In this description, radiation is generated by stimulated
</p>
<p>electronic transitions between discrete energy levels.
</p>
<p>In the energy-ladder description of the elementary excitations in a free-electron
</p>
<p>laser medium, the free-electron medium is an active medium with a population inver-
</p>
<p>sion. In the description by classical Maxwell theory and also in the modulation model,
</p>
<p>the free-electron laser is a laser with an active medium without population inversion.
</p>
<p>We will not discuss a radiation source&mdash;also called free-electron laser&mdash;that is
</p>
<p>operating at very large electron currents. In this type of free-electron laser, electron&ndash;
</p>
<p>electron interaction gives rise to charge density domains. Electromagnetic radiation
</p>
<p>interacts with a collective of electrons. These free-electron lasers, which are single-
</p>
<p>pass free-electron lasers, are also able to produce radiation of very large power;
</p>
<p>however, the radiation is not monochromatic.
</p>
<p>19.1 Principle of the Free-Electron Laser
</p>
<p>In a free-electron laser (Fig. 19.1), a beam of electrons (energy Eel,0) traverses a peri-
</p>
<p>odic magnetic field (period λw). Due to the Lorentz force, the electrons execute trans-</p>

</p>
<p>verse oscillations. The oscillating electrons form an active medium ( free-electron
</p>
<p>laser medium = FEL medium). Stimulated emission of radiation by the free-electron
oscillators gives rise to buildup and maintenance of a high frequency field in a laser
</p>
<p>resonator. Laser radiation (output power Pout) is coupled out via a partial mirror.
</p>
<p>The relativistic energy of an electron, which enters a periodic magnetic field with
</p>
<p>the velocity vz,0, is given by
</p>
<p>Eel,0 = γm0c2, (19.1)
</p>
<p>where m0 is the electron mass and

<p>γ =
1
</p>
<p>&radic;
</p>
<p>1 &minus; v2z,0/c2
(19.2)
</p>
<p>is the Lorentz factor; γ measures the relativistic energy of an electron in units of
</p>
<p>m0c
2; γ = EMeV/0.51 MeV. The oscillation frequency of a free-electron oscillation
</p>
<p>is equal to
</p>
<p>ν0 =

<p>1 + K 2w/2
2cγ 2
</p>
<p>λw

</p>
<p>Kw (= wiggler parameter) is the dimensionless wiggler strength. We will show (in
Sect. 19.3) that it is given by
</p>
<p>Kw =
eBwλw
</p>
<p>2πm0c

</p>
<p>Bw is the maximum strength of a magnetic field assumed to vary sinusoidally along
</p>
<p>the wiggler axis; a value K 2w = 1, for instance, characterizes strong transverse oscil-
lations. On the ω scale, the electron oscillation frequency is given by

<p>Interaction of the free-electron oscillations with the high frequency field in the
</p>
<p>resonator results in conversion of a portion of power of the electron beam into power
</p>
<p>of laser radiation. The laser frequency has a value near the resonance frequency of
</p>
<p>the free-electron oscillations,
</p>
<p>ν &sim; ν0. (19.6)
</p>
<p>But ν is slightly smaller than ν0. It follows that the wavelength of the laser radiation
</p>
<p>is about equal to
</p>
<p>λ &sim;
λw
</p>
<p>2γ 2
(1 + K 2w/2). (19.7)
</p>
<p>We describe the free-electron laser in more detail. A beam of relativistic electrons,
</p>
<p>produced by the use of an accelerator (Fig. 19.2a), traverses a spatially periodic mag-
</p>
<p>netic field and excites a radiation field in the optical resonator. The electron beam,
</p>
<p>guided by a bending magnet into the resonator, passes the periodic magnetic field,
</p>
<p>which is produced by use of a periodic magnet structure, the wiggler (= undulator).
The electron beam then leaves the resonator by means of a second bending mag-
</p>
<p>net. Along the resonator axis (z axis), the magnetic field direction assumes the +y
direction and the &minus;y direction in turn. It varies in the simplest case sinusoidally,
</p>
<p>By = Bw sin
2π
</p>
<p>λw
z. (19.8)
</p>
<p>The length of the wiggler is Lw = Nwλw and Nw is the number of wiggler periods.
Due to the Lorentz force, the electrons execute oscillations perpendicular to the
</p>
<p>magnetic field direction (y direction) and perpendicular to the z direction; i.e., the
</p>
<p>electrons oscillate with elongations in &plusmn;x direction.
The wiggler can consist of two rows of equal magnets, with north poles N and
</p>
<p>south poles S arranged periodically (Fig. 19.2b). The magnetization of a magnet and
</p>
<p>the distance d between the rows determine the field strength Bw. Magnets prepared
</p>
<p>from a samarium-cobalt alloy, which have a high magnetization, are suitable as wig-
</p>
<p>gler magnets. Alternatively, the wiggler is a superconducting magnet with a helical
</p>
<p>winding of the superconducting wires, leading to a circular sinusoidally varying
</p>
<p>transverse magnetic field.
</p>
<p>The electron beam in the range between the wiggler magnets constitutes the free-
</p>
<p>electron laser medium (Fig. 19.2c). A radiation field propagating in +z direction is
amplified.
</p>
<p>The length L of the optical resonator is larger than the length Lw of the wiggler;
</p>
<p>z0 is the center of both the optical resonator and the wiggler. We consider the optical
</p>
<p>beam as a parallel beam within the active medium.
</p>
<p>There are various comprehensive books and articles about free-electron lasers;
</p>
<p>see, for instance, [166, 167, 312].</p>

<p>Operation of a free-electron laser places great demands on the accelerator.
</p>
<p>&bull; High current density. The current density of a quasi-continuous free-electron laser
should lie in the range 1&ndash;10 A. At smaller current, the gain is too small to reach laser
</p>
<p>threshold. At larger current, electron interaction (Coulomb repulsion) destroys the
</p>
<p>quality of the electron beam. The current density can be much larger in the case
</p>
<p>that the pulses are very short&mdash;1 kA for instance or even more for electron pulses
</p>
<p>of 0.1 ps duration.
</p>
<p>&bull; High quality of the electron beam. The energy distribution in the electron beam
should be narrow, for instance 0.1&ndash;1% of Eel,0. The divergence of the electron
</p>
<p>beam should be small.
</p>
<p>Almost all free-electron lasers make use of electron pulses, produced by linear accel-
</p>
<p>erators, and therefore generate radiation pulses. There is one exception: free-electron
</p>
<p>lasers at the University of California, Santa Barbara (United States) produce quasi-
</p>
<p>continuous radiation.
</p>
<p>The first free-electron lasers was operated at Stanford University [168, 169] and
</p>
<p>the second at the research center in Santa Barbara. After the first demonstrations of
</p>
<p>free-electron lasers, many research centers began to develop free-electron lasers.</p>

</p>
<p>laser
</p>
<p>The free-electron lasers in Santa Barbara operate very successful with respect
</p>
<p>to the study of excitations of condensed matter. An electrostatic accelerator with
</p>
<p>a design of high originality drives a free-electron laser (Fig. 19.3). The accelerator
</p>
<p>(6 MeV) is a pelletron (a modified van de Graaff accelerator), which allows for
</p>
<p>a high charging current (current strength 100 &micro;A). Metal cylinders (length about
</p>
<p>10 cm, diameter 10 cm) move from the anode to the cathode and back. Metal tips
</p>
<p>on the low-voltage side extract electrons from the anode and metal tips on the high-
</p>
<p>voltage side extract electrons from the metal cylinders. Free-electrons, produced
</p>
<p>with an electron gun at the cathode, are accelerated, pass through laser resonator and
</p>
<p>are then recovered by a deceleration system. The recovery of the electrons makes
</p>
<p>it possible that, during a certain time (&sim;30 &micro;s), a constant current of high strength
(&sim;2 A) is flowing through the free-electron laser. A voltage (&sim;50 kV), produced
with a generator and a power supply at the cathode, accelerates the electrons to
</p>
<p>compensate energy loss due to generation of radiation in the free-electron laser. The
</p>
<p>wiggler consists of samarium-cobalt magnets. Radiation pulses of 30 &micro;s duration
</p>
<p>are generated at a repetition rate of few Hz. The radiation has a very high degree of
</p>
<p>monochromaticity. The free-electron lasers generate millimeter wave and far infrared
</p>
<p>radiation of a power up to 10 kW. The free-electron lasers are continuously tunable.
</p>
<p>The free-electron laser laboratory in Santa Barbara is available as user facility.
</p>
<p>Another user facility, available in a laboratory in Dresden (Germany), pro-
</p>
<p>duces pulsed far infrared and infrared radiation also by using several free-electron
</p>
<p>lasers. These free-electron lasers are driven by linear accelerators (LINACs) with
</p>
<p>15&ndash;45 MeV electron energy and peak currents up to 100 A. The lasers generate radi-
</p>
<p>ation pulses (duration 0.1 ps or longer) with pulse powers of 100 kW to 1 MW.
</p>
<p>The SASE free-electron laser principle has been successfully demonstrated [170]
</p>
<p>for visible (wavelength 530 nm) and near ultraviolet radiation (385 nm); operation of
</p>
<p>SASE free-electron lasers generating radiation of GW power of VUV radiation in
</p>
<p>the 100 nm range (tuned in the range 95&ndash;105 nm) [171] and of radiation at 32 nm
</p>
<p>[172&ndash;174] has been reported. A SASE free-electron laser is a mirrorless laser;
</p>
<p>SASE = self-amplified spontaneous emission.
Presently (2016), X-ray SASE free-electron lasers experience an exciting devel-
</p>
<p>opment. X-ray SASE free-electron lasers are operating at wavelengths from 100 nm</p>
<p/>

<p>19.2 Free-Electron Laser Arrangements 353
</p>
<p>to less than 0.1 nm; for surveys, see [312, 313]. The lasers produce pulses of a few
</p>
<p>to 100 fs duration and peak powers of 10&ndash;100 GW. There is a wide field of applica-
</p>
<p>tions in physics, chemistry, and biology. An example is the study of nonlinear X-ray
</p>
<p>excitation of atoms [314, 315]. X-ray SASE free-electron lasers generate radiation
</p>
<p>with transverse coherence. Longitudinal coherence is absent according to the ini-
</p>
<p>tial process of spontaneously generated radiation; in comparison, in a free-electron
</p>
<p>laser, spontaneously generated radiation also initiates oscillation, however, feedback
</p>
<p>of radiation during the onset of laser oscillation by the laser resonator results in
</p>
<p>complete coherence of the free-electron laser radiation.
</p>
<p>Seeded free-electron lasers, another type of single-pass free-electron lasers, pro-
</p>
<p>vide fully coherent radiation; in a seeded free-electron laser, a coherent radiation
</p>
<p>pulse is injected, together with an electron pulse, into a first wiggler of a series of
</p>
<p>many wigglers in turn. Operation of seeded free-electron lasers has been demon-
</p>
<p>strated. High harmonic radiation pulses of mode locked titanium-sapphire lasers
</p>
<p>have been used to generate radiation at discrete frequencies in the 20&ndash;100 nm range
</p>
<p>[313, 317&ndash;321].
</p>
<p>Extension of the wavelength of free-electron lasers by using harmonics of the
</p>
<p>fundamental frequency of a free-electron laser is, in principle, possible by operation
</p>
<p>of a free-electron laser at a harmonic of the fundamental oscillation frequency of the
</p>
<p>electrons in a laser; for recent studies, see [322, 323].
</p>
<p>During the flight through a wiggler, an electron permanently loses energy due
</p>
<p>to stimulated emission of radiation. Therefore, the oscillation frequency decreases
</p>
<p>along the wiggler. In a tapered wiggler, the oscillation frequency is kept constant.
</p>
<p>A constant oscillation frequency can be achieved either by reducing, along the +z
direction, the wiggler period or by increasing the distance d between the wiggler
</p>
<p>magnets. Light guiding in the active medium of a SASE free-electron laser avoids
</p>
<p>spreading of the radiation beam.
</p>
<p>The radiation of free-electron lasers is suitable for research (e.g., in solid state
</p>
<p>physics and biophysics), for technical applications (e.g., structuring).
</p>
<p>19.3 Free-Electron Oscillation: Resonance Frequency
</p>
<p>and Spontaneously Emitted Radiation
</p>
<p>In this section, we relate the resonance frequency of the free-electron oscillation
</p>
<p>and the electron energy. We will obtain, additionally, the spectrum of spontanously
</p>
<p>emitted radiation. We will proceed in three steps.
</p>
<p>&bull; First step: we study generation of spontaneously emitted radiation and take the
relativistic Doppler effect into account. We will obtain the oscillation frequency
</p>
<p>of the free-electron oscillations,

<p>ν0 =

<p>and a spectrum of spontaneously emitted dipole radiation, centered at ν0.
</p>
<p>&bull; Second step: we interpret the emission of radiation as relativistic Compton scat-
tering. We will find that the analysis also leads to the frequency ν0.
</p>
<p>&bull; Third step: we determine the modified resonance frequency ν0 as it occurs in
free-electron lasers.
</p>
<p>An oscillating free-electron moving at a relativistic velocity emits radiation at a
</p>
<p>frequency according to the relativistic Doppler effect. The radiation observed in the
</p>
<p>laboratory frame has an extreme forward direction.
</p>
<p>The motion of an electron through a wiggler takes the time (Fig. 19.4)
</p>
<p>t = Nwλw/v. (19.10)
</p>
<p>Nw is the number of wiggler periods,λw the wiggler period, and v the electron velocity
</p>
<p>along the wiggler. In the same time in which an electron traverses the wiggler, the
</p>
<p>electron emits an electromagnetic wave packet with Nw oscillation cycles. A wave
</p>
<p>packet of radiation emitted in z direction has the spatial length
</p>
<p>(c &minus; v)t = Nwλw(1 &minus; β)/β, (19.11)
</p>
<p>where β = v/c. Since (c &minus; v)t = Nwλ, where λ is the wavelength of the radiation,
it follows that
</p>
<p>Nwλ = Nwλw(1 &minus; β)/β (19.12)

<p>The halfwidth of the [sin(X/2)/(X/2)]2 curve (Fig. 19.5) is equal to δX0 = 5.7. This

</p>
<p>The halfwidth corresponds, for Nw = 100, to 1% of ω0. The oscillations of the
electrons are not synchronized to each other. Therefore, the phases of the wave
</p>
<p>packets, emitted by different electrons, are statistically distributed. A pulse containing
</p>
<p>Np electrons leads to an average amplitude that is proportional to
&radic;
</p>
<p>N p. The power
</p>
<p>is proportional to Np, which itself is proportional to the strength I of the electron
</p>
<p>current. Thus, the power of spontaneously emitted radiation is proportional to the
</p>
<p>current strength. Since the electrons are moving at a relativistic velocity near the
</p>
<p>speed of light, the emission occurs into a narrow cone directed along the direction
</p>
<p>of the electron beam.
</p>
<p>In the first step, we obtained an important result with respect to a beam of electrons,
</p>
<p>which have a narrow energy distribution. A beam of electrons traversing a periodic

ν0 = 2cγ 2/λw; this is the oscillation frequency (resonance frequency) of the free-
electron oscillations if Kw &lt;&lt; 1.
</p>
<p>&bull; The spectrum shows a frequency distribution varying as (sin X/X)2, where
X = Nw(ν &minus; ν0)/ν0.
</p>
<p>&bull; The relative width of the spectrum is 1/Nw.
</p>
<p>In the second step, we attribute the origin of free-electron laser radiation to Comp-
</p>
<p>ton scattering. We perform a relativistic transformation from the laboratory frame to
</p>
<p>the electron frame. We then describe the Compton scattering in the electron frame.
</p>
<p>The relativistic transformation back into the laboratory frame yields the wavelength
</p>
<p>of the radiation (Fig. 19.6);
</p>
<p>&bull; Laboratory frame (a). An electron has the velocity v and moves toward the wiggler
field of wavelength λw.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electron frame, before scattering (b). The electron experiences an electromag-
netic field of the wavelength λ&prime; = λw/(2γ ). The wavelength λ&prime; is smaller than λw
because of the relativistic length contraction. The factor 1/2 occurs since the wig-
</p>
<p>gler field in the laboratory frame is a static field (Weizs&auml;cker-Williams theorem
</p>
<p>[59]).
</p>
<p>&bull; Electron frame, scattering process (c). Compton scattering of the electromagnetic
radiation at the electrons reverses the direction of the electromagnetic field. There-
</p>
<p>fore, the wavelength λ&prime; is the same before and after scattering (supposed that the
recoil energy of an electron can be neglected).
</p>
<p>&bull; Laboratory frame (d). The transformation back into the laboratory frame leads,
due to the relativistic contraction of length, to the wavelength λ = λw/(2γ 2).
</p>
<p>In the first two steps, we assumed that an electron has almost no energy of trans-
</p>
<p>verse motion and that an electron in the wiggler has therefore the γ value of a
</p>
<p>free-electron. We come to the third step. We assume that the average energy of longi-
</p>
<p>tudinal motion of an electron in the wiggler is notably reduced, in comparison with
</p>
<p>the free flight, because of the occurrence of transverse oscillations. The equation of

<p>358 19 Free-Electron Laser
</p>
<p>Spontaneously emitted radiation plays an important role at the onset of laser oscil-
</p>
<p>lation; the spectrum of spontaneously emitted radiation determines the frequency
</p>
<p>distribution of laser radiation at steady state oscillation (Sect. 19.12).
</p>
<p>19.4 Data of a Free-Electron Laser
</p>
<p>We present data of a free-electron laser (Table 19.1). The data, oriented at infrared
</p>
<p>free-electron lasers, are concerning the laser resonator, the high frequency field (=
optical field) in a resonator, the electron beam and the free-electron laser medium.
</p>
<p>We choose the laser wavelength λ = 5 &micro;m (laser frequency ν = 6 &times; 1013 Hz;
photon energy hν = 0.25 eV). A resonator of length L = 10 m is suitable as laser
resonator; the beam waist has a radius ru,0 = 3.5 mm. The lifetime of a photon in
the resonator is τp = (2L/c)/(1 &minus; R). We assume that the reflectivity of the output
coupling mirror is R = 0.9.
</p>
<p>We assume that the wiggler has a length of Lw = 1.2 m and a period of λw =
2.4 cm and that the number of wiggler periods is Nw = 50. The time it takes the
electrons and the radiation to pass through the wiggler field is the transit time ttr =
Lw/c (= 4 ns). The resonance frequency ν0 of the free-electron oscillations is only
slightly larger than the laser frequency ν. The gain bandwidth is 6 &times; 1011 Hz. A
current Iel = 100 A corresponding to a current density j = Iel/(πr2u,0ec) = 6.6 &times;
104 A m&minus;2, an electron density N0 = jdc/(ec)= 8 &times; 1016 m&minus;3, and a rate of electrons
traversing the active medium rel = I/e (= 1.2 &times; 1019 s&minus;1). We assume that the small-
signal gain is G &minus; 1 = 0.5.
</p>
<p>We assume that the output power Pout has a value of &sim;1 MW and that this output
power corresponds to laser oscillation at saturation of the high frequency field within
</p>
<p>the laser resonator. Accordingly, the saturation of the high frequency field within
</p>
<p>the laser resonator. Accordingly, the saturation field amplitude is Asat = A&infin; &sim;
4 &times; 107 V m&minus;1 and the density of photons in the resonator is Z&infin; = ε0 A2&infin;/2hν (&sim;2&times;
1022 m&minus;3). The total photon output coupling rate is rph = Pout/hν= (2.5 &times; 1025 s&minus;1).

<p>Pout =

</p>
<p>of a free-electron laser is independent of the length of the active medium&mdash;because
</p>
<p>of field saturation. This is a main difference between a free-electron laser and a
</p>
<p>conventional laser: the density Z&infin; of photons in the resonator of a conventional
laser and Pout increase if we increase the length of the active medium (and double
</p>
<p>the total pump strength).
</p>
<p>Each electron traversing the active medium generates a large number of photons:
</p>
<p>the number of photons generated (per electron) by stimulated emission is sstim. The
</p>
<p>time between two stimulated emission processes is τstim = ttr/sstim (= 2 &times; 10&minus;14 s).</p>

<p>360 19 Free-Electron Laser
</p>
<p>A free-electron laser for generation of radiation in the range around 5 &micro;m can
</p>
<p>be realized by using a beam of electrons of an initial energy Eel,0 near 50 MeV (at
</p>
<p>a wiggler period λw = 2.4 cm). The power efficiency, ηP = Pout/Pel on the order of
0.1%. The loss of energy of an electron, Eel,0 &minus; Eel,&infin; = sstimhν (= 500 keV) due to
stimulated emission corresponds to 10&minus;2 Eel,0. [The loss cannot be larger, because
an electron cannot contribute to gain if its energy loss relative to the initial energy
</p>
<p>is larger than 1/(2Nw). There is another limitation: the saturation field is limited, see
</p>
<p>Sect. 19.8.]
</p>
<p>The data of Table 19.1 characterize a pulsed laser and correspond to peak values.
</p>
<p>We obtain an average output Pout,av = Pouttprp, where tp is the pulse duration and rp
the pulse repetition rate; for example, tp = 0.1 ps, rp = 107 s&minus;1 and Pout,av = 2 W.
</p>
<p>Laser operation requires that the amplitude of the high frequency field in the
</p>
<p>resonator is smaller than the damage field of the laser mirrors. A short pulse duration
</p>
<p>is therefore necessary to reach the amplitude A&infin;.
</p>
<p>19.5 Rigid Coupling of Transverse and Longitudinal
</p>
<p>Oscillation of an Electron
</p>
<p>Entering the wiggler, an electron is submitted to the Lorentz force of the transverse
</p>
<p>magnetic field. The electron starts a transverse oscillation. The transverse oscillation
</p>
<p>is rigidly coupled to a longitudinal oscillation (Fig. 19.7a). The orbit of the electron
</p>
<p>has the shape of an &ldquo;eight&rdquo; (see Problem 19.14). The x component, vx , of the velocity
</p>
<p>of the electron is rigidly coupled to the z component, vz . The coupling is mediated
</p>
<p>by the Lorentz force. The x component is given by (19.21) and the z component by
</p>
<p>(19.22). The longitudinal velocity oscillates twice as fast as the transverse velocity
</p>
<p>(Fig. 19.8b).
</p>
<p>The transverse velocity of an electron is small compared with the speed of light.
</p>
<p>We can therefore describe the transverse motion nonrelativistically. An observer in

</p>
<p>19.6 High Frequency Transverse Currents
</p>
<p>Two different types of transverse currents (both oscillating in &plusmn;x direction) are
characteristic of the active medium of a free-electron laser. We now introduce two
</p>
<p>types of currents.
</p>
<p>&bull; Transverse electron current Ie(ω0). The transverse electron current is joined with
the transverse oscillation of a single electron in the wiggler field, Ie = &minus;ev =
&minus;ev0 cosω0t, where v0 = cKW/γ is the amplitude of the transverse current and
ω0 the oscillation frequency.
</p>
<p>&bull; Transverse modulation current Imod(ω). The modulation current is a consequence
of the interaction of the electron oscillation with a high frequency electric field of
</p>
<p>frequencyω. The interaction is due to phase modulation of the electron oscillation.
</p>
<p>The modulation current of an electron leads to a transverse dynamical conductivity
</p>
<p>of an ensemble of electrons in a free-electron laser medium.
</p>
<p>A high frequency electric field (oriented along x) of frequency ω and amplitude
</p>
<p>A,
</p>
<p>Ẽ(ω) = A eiωt , (19.34)
</p>
<p>exerts an electric force on an electron. This causes a change of the trajectory of the
</p>
<p>electron in the wiggler. We will describe the action of the field as a phase modulation
</p>
<p>of the transverse velocity v (and accordingly of the transverse current Ie). The phase
</p>
<p>modulated oscillation of the electron leads to a transverse modulation velocity
</p>
<p>vmod(ω) &equiv; ṽ(ω) = v1(ω)&minus; iv2(ω) (19.35)
</p>
<p>at the frequency ω of the high frequency electric field. The modulation velocity
</p>
<p>depends linearly on the electric field:
</p>
<p>ṽ(ω) = η̃(ω) Ẽ(ω), (19.36)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.6 High Frequency Transverse Currents 363
</p>
<p>where η̃(ω) is the complex dynamical mobility of an electron for transverse motion
</p>
<p>under the action of a high frequency electric field. We can characterize an ensemble
</p>
<p>of electrons performing modulated oscillations at the frequency ω by a transverse
</p>
<p>current density j̃(ω). Assuming that electrons of an ensemble are oscillating syn-
</p>
<p>chronously, we obtain a transverse current density at a location of a free-electron
</p>
<p>laser medium that is given by
</p>
<p>j̃(ω) = N0 q ṽ(ω) = N0 q η̃(ω) Ẽ(ω) (19.37)
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>j̃(ω) = σ̃ (ω) Ẽ(ω). (19.38)
</p>
<p>N0 is the electron density, σ̃ (ω) = N0 q η̃(ω) is the transverse dynamical conductiv-
ity of the free-electron laser medium at the frequencyω, and q = (&minus;e) is the electron
charge.
</p>
<p>We thus describe the linear response of the free-electron laser medium to a high
</p>
<p>frequency electric field by the transverse modulation current density in the free-
</p>
<p>electron laser medium (Fig. 19.9b),
</p>

</p>
<p>j2(ω) = σ2(ω)A sinωt (19.42)
</p>
<p>has a phase of 90◦ relative to the field and corresponds to an inductive current. The
current is phase shifted relative to the field,
</p>
<p>j (ω) = σ(ω)A cos[ωt + ϕ(ω)], (19.43)
</p>
<p>where

<p>σ 21 + σ 22 (19.44)
</p>
<p>is the absolute value of the conductivity and where ϕ is the phase between current
</p>
<p>density and field. The phase follows from the relation
</p>
<p>tan ϕ = σ2/σ1. (19.45)
</p>
<p>We assume that the optical beam has the same lateral extension as the electron
</p>
<p>beam and that the electron density N0 and the amplitude A of the high frequency
</p>
<p>field do not vary over the cross section. Our goal is to derive σ1(ω) and σ2(ω). gain
</p>
<p>coefficient. From the real part of the high frequency transverse conductivity, we
</p>
<p>obtain the (small-signal) gain coefficient:
</p>
<p>α(ω) = &minus;
1
</p>
<p>ε0c
σ1(ω). (19.46)
</p>
<p>Here, we give a short description, how a free-electron laser works according to
</p>
<p>the modulation model presented in the next section. Single electrons in the wiggler
</p>
<p>perform oscillations at the resonance frequency ω0. A high frequency electric field
</p>
<p>of frequency ω modulates the oscillations. The modulation results in a transverse
</p>
<p>modulation current density j̃(ω) at the frequency of the electric field. The electric
</p>
<p>field can be amplified or damped-depending on the phase between the modulation
</p>
<p>current density and the field. In the case that amplification occurs, i.e., if σ1(ω) is
</p>
<p>negative, then the gain coefficient α(ω) is positive and the free-electron laser medium
</p>
<p>is an active medium. If the threshold condition for laser oscillation is satisfied, a free-
</p>
<p>electron laser starts oscillation itself and maintains oscillation as long as electrons
</p>
<p>are propagating through the wiggler. A weak high frequency electric field initiates
</p>
<p>oscillation of a free-electron laser. Mutual interaction of the field and the transverse
</p>
<p>modulation current leads to growth of both the field and the modulation current. The
</p>
<p>initial high frequency electric field is created by spontaneous emission of radiation
</p>
<p>by the transversely oscillating electrons.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.6 High Frequency Transverse Currents 365
</p>
<p>Since the transverse dynamical conductivity is a local quantity, the gain coefficient
</p>
<p>α(ω) is also a local quantity. It is a goal to determine the dependence of the gain
</p>
<p>coefficient α on frequency, location, and on time.
</p>
<p>Introduction of a modulation current density for characterization of an active
</p>
<p>medium of a free-electron laser medium that is based on monopole oscillations of
</p>
<p>electrons is equivalent to the introduction of a polarization (Chap. 9) for characteri-
</p>
<p>zation of an active medium of a laser that is based on dipole oscillations in an active
</p>
<p>medium (containing two-level atomic systems).
</p>
<p>19.7 Modulation Model of the Free-Electron Laser
</p>
<p>An electron that entered the wiggler performs a transverse oscillation, in x direction,
</p>
<p>with the transverse velocity
</p>
<p>v = v0 cosω0t, (19.47)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>v0 =
cKw
</p>
<p>γ
(19.48)
</p>
<p>is the amplitude of the transverse velocity and ω0 the frequency of the oscillation.
</p>
<p>We now assume that an oscillating electron travels along z together with the high
</p>
<p>frequency field E , which is oriented along x ,
</p>
<p>E(ω) = A cosωt. (19.49)
</p>
<p>A is the amplitude and ω the frequency of the field. The high frequency field causes
</p>
<p>a phase modulation of the electron oscillation. The electron has an instantaneous
</p>
<p>frequency
</p>
<p>ωinst = ω0 + κA cosωt, (19.50)
</p>
<p>where κ is the coupling strength. We will show that κ is proportional to the wiggler
</p>
<p>parameter Kw. We relate the instantaneous frequency to a phase according to the
</p>
<p>relationship ω = &part;ϕ/&part;t . Integration leads to the instantaneous phase
</p>
<p>ϕinst = ω0(t &minus; t0)+ μ(sinωt &minus; sinωt0), (19.51)
</p>
<p>where t0 is a starting time of the oscillation. The instantaneous transverse velocity is
</p>

(19.53)
</p>
<p>is the modulation index. It is proportional to the coupling strength and to the amplitude
</p>
<p>of the high frequency electric field, and inversely proportional to the frequency. The
</p>
<p>modulation index is a measure for the deviation of the instantaneous phase from the
</p>
<p>phase ω0t.
</p>
<p>In the case that ω &lt; ω0, the electron oscillates faster than the field (Fig. 19.10).
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the phase between the electron oscillation and the field increases con-
</p>
<p>tinuously with time&mdash;we denote this as dephasing. The continuous increase of the
</p>
<p>phase difference can be interrupted by a stimulated emission process. A stimulated
</p>
<p>emission process occurs preferentially when the phase between velocity and elec-
</p>
<p>tric field is zero. A stimulated emission process changes the phase of the electron
</p>
<p>oscillation. After a stimulated emission process, the phase difference grows until
</p>
<p>a new stimulated emission process takes place. The time between two subsequent
</p>
<p>stimulated emission processes is the dephasing time τ ; we suppose that the elec-
tron follows the Lorentz force by the static magnetic field adiabatically. Stimulated
</p>
<p>emission of a photon by an oscillating electron does not change the frequency ω of
</p>
<p>the high frequency field and the frequency ω0 of the electron oscillation is the same
</p>
<p>before and after stimulated emission of a photon. The amplitude v0 of the transverse
</p>
<p>velocity remains also unchanged. Stimulated emission processes in turn lead to syn-
</p>
<p>chronization of the electron oscillation to the electric field. We thus find that the
</p>
<p>transverse oscillation of the electron mediates gain for the field. Energy of transverse
</p>
<p>motion is converted to energy of radiation.
</p>
<p>The free-electron oscillation of a free-electron in a periodic magnetic field repre-
</p>
<p>sents a monopole oscillation (Sect. 4.12). Interaction with an external high frequency
</p>
<p>field changes the phase of the oscillation but not the amplitude.

<p>The probability that an oscillating electron does not undergo a stimulated emission

<p>We have assumed that the electron beam and the optical beam have the same

</p>
<p>We will introduce (in the next two sections) a saturation field amplitude Asat
and attribute the saturation field amplitude to a critical modulation index μc. We
</p>
<p>will choose μc = 1. If, at the onset of oscillation of a free-electron laser, the sat-
uration field amplitude and thus the critical modulation index is reached, then the
</p>
<p>active medium goes over into the state of saturation (Fig. 19.12b). The maximum
</p>
<p>gain coefficient αm is almost constant up to μc. Therefore, αm is the small-signal
</p>
<p>gain coefficient as well as the large-signal gain coefficient. (However, we will differ
</p>
<p>between small-signal gain and large-signal gain; see, Sect. 19.12.)
</p>
<p>19.8 Saturation Field and Energy of Distortion
</p>
<p>In this section, we present a criterion that allows for an estimate of the saturation
</p>
<p>field amplitude Asat. We study a free-electron laser at steady state oscillation. The
</p>
<p>field at a location in the laser resonator has the amplitude Asat,
</p>
<p>E = Asat cosωt. (19.77)
</p>
<p>We consider the case that the phase between the velocity of an electron and the
</p>
<p>electric field is equal to zero,
</p>
<p>v = v0 cosω0t ; v0 = c Kw/γ. (19.78)
</p>
<p>We ask the question: which is the maximum rate at which energy can be exchanged
</p>
<p>between an oscillating electron and an optical field? We introduce the criterion:
</p>
<p>The work done by an electron during an oscillation cycle has an upper limit. At the
</p>
<p>upper limit, the work results in a strong distortion of the electron oscillation.
</p>
<p>The work done by an electron under the action of the high frequency field has a
</p>
<p>maximum value if the phase between field and velocity of the electron oscillation is
</p>
<p>zero. Then, the work is given by
</p>
<p>W1,φ=0 = &minus;ev0 Asat
&int; T
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>cos(ω0t) cos(ωt) dt (19.79)
</p>
<p>The solution is, with ω0 &asymp; ω, equal to
</p>
<p>W1,φ=0 = &minus;π e v0 Asat/ω. (19.80)
</p>
<p>We now assume that distortion occurs if the work is equal to the distortion energy
</p>
<p>E&lowast;, i.e., if
W1,φ=0 = &minus;E&lowast;. (19.81)
</p>
<p>Comparison of (1980) and (1981) provides the saturation field amplitude</p>

</p>
<p>(E&lowast;/e) γ ω
</p>
<p>π c Kw
. (19.82)
</p>
<p>The saturation field amplitude Asat is proportional to the distortion energy, to
</p>
<p>the Lorentz factor, and to the frequency. It is inversely proportional to the wiggler
</p>
<p>parameter Kw. The frequency dependence corresponds to an ω
3/2 dependence.
</p>
<p>A process leading to distortion changes the phase of the oscillation by π. After
</p>
<p>a change of the phase, the reversed process occurs: the field transfers energy to the
</p>
<p>electron. The work is given
</p>
<p>W1,φ=π = +ev0 Asat
&int; T
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>cos(ω0t) cos(ωt) dt = + π ev0 Asat/ω, (19.83)
</p>
<p>or,
</p>
<p>W1,φ=π = +E&lowast;. (19.84)
</p>
<p>Our analysis implies that a process that causes distortion is accompanied by stim-
</p>
<p>ulated emission of radiation and that the reversed process is accompanied by absorp-
</p>
<p>tion of radiation. Absorption of radiation during a cycle of the electron oscillation
</p>
<p>follows on stimulated emission during the preceding cycle of the electron oscillation.
</p>
<p>At steady state oscillation of a free-electron laser, there is, in the saturation region of
</p>
<p>the wiggler, no net energy transfer of energy from the electrons to the field and vice
</p>
<p>versa, from the field to the electrons: absorption compensates stimulated emission
</p>
<p>of radiation. Analysis of free-electron laser data (Sect. 19.10) on basis of the ideas
</p>
<p>presented in this section suggest that a process causing distortion involves more than
</p>
<p>one photon per electron oscillation cycle. This corresponds to a fast cascade of stim-
</p>
<p>ulated emission of photons during one cycle of the electron oscillation. The reversed
</p>
<p>process involves the same number of photons and corresponds to a fast cascade of
</p>
<p>absorption processes during one cycle of the electron oscillation. The processes are
</p>
<p>also discussed in Sects. 19.13, 19.17, and 19.19.
</p>
<p>We will treat the distortion energy as a parameter that can be determined from
</p>
<p>experimental data of free-electron lasers. We expect that the distortion energy
</p>
<p>depends on the wiggler parameter. We will show that experimental data for exist-
</p>
<p>ing free-electron lasers are consistent with a distortion energy on the order of 1
</p>
<p>eV (E&lowast;/e &asymp; 2 V); see also Problem 19.16 suggesting a derivation of the distortion
energy.

<p>19.9 Critical Modulation Index
</p>
<p>The modulation index depends, according to its definition, on the coupling strength,
</p>
<p>μ =
κ A
</p>
<p>ω
. (19.87)
</p>
<p>We introduce the critical modulation index μc by the relationship
</p>
<p>μ
</p>
<p>μc
=
</p>
<p>A
</p>
<p>Asat
or
</p>
<p>μ
</p>
<p>A
=
</p>
<p>μc
</p>
<p>Asat
. (19.88)
</p>
<p>The critical modulation index, a dimensionless number, corresponds to the modula-
</p>
<p>tion index that is reached if the amplitude of the high frequency electric field is equal
</p>
<p>to the saturation field amplitude Asat.
</p>
<p>In order to find out the value of μc, we consider the phase difference between the
</p>
<p>transverse oscillation of an electron and the high frequency electric field,
</p>
<p>φ(x) = x &minus; μ sin ax, (19.89)
</p>
<p>where x = ω0t is the phase for μ = 0 and a = (ω0 &minus; ω)/ω0 is the difference of
the frequencies of the electron oscillation and the high frequency electric field,
</p>
<p>divided by ω0. Without modulation (μ = 0), the phase φ increases linearly with
time. In the case that a high frequency electric field modulates the electron oscil-
</p>
<p>lation, the phase difference oscillates around the φ = x line. The amplitude of this
oscillation increases with increasing μ. The phase difference φ increases continu-
</p>
<p>ously with time as long as μ &lt; 1. However, for μ &gt; 1, the same phase difference
</p>
<p>can be obtained for two different times. The change from the continuous increase
</p>
<p>to the more complicated behavior occurs at the critical modulation index μc. We
</p>
<p>find the value of μc from the condition that the derivative dφ/dx is zero, that is,
</p>
<p>dφ/dx = 1 &minus; μ a = 0, which leads to
</p>
<p>μc =
1
</p>
<p>a
&asymp; 1 (19.90)

<p>The modulation model thus leads to the result (Fig. 19.13) that, at fixed frequency,
</p>
<p>the coupling strength κ increases as proportional to the wiggler parameter Kw, the

energy.

by changing the current strength Iel and the mode area amode, i.e., by changing the

We find the modal gain coefficient αm = 0.3 m&minus;1 and, assuming that the radius of
the waist of the beam (in a near concentric resonator) was ru = 2 mm, the saturation
field amplitude is given by Asat = 2 &times; 108 V m&minus;1. The experimental value for the
gain G &minus; 1 and for the average output power (12 kW) agreed (within few percent)
with theoretical values determined by a three-dimensional simulation [326]. The
</p>
<p>FEL emitted pulses at a repetition rate of 37 MHz (corresponding to the resonator
</p>
<p>length). For determination of the pulse power, we took into account that the pulses
</p>
<p>had Gaussian shape.

<p>The efficiency η = Pout/ [(Eel/e) Iel] of the free-electron lasers for conversion of

</p>
<p>The far infrared lasers (Examples 3&ndash;5) are using hybrid resonators. A hybrid
</p>
<p>resonator consists of a parallel plate resonator combined with an optical resonator.
</p>
<p>The arrangement results in a mode volume that is larger than for a purely Gaussian

<p>beam resonator. Radiation is coupled out from a free-electron resonator via a hole

<p>in one of the optical mirrors. (Broadband dielectric mirrors are not available for</p>

</p>
<p>radiation at wavelengths below a few micrometer. Metal film mirrors are not suitable
</p>
<p>as partially transparent mirrors because of a strong absorptivity in comparison to the
</p>
<p>transmissivity.) Diffraction of radiation in a resonator at a hole in a mirror causes
</p>
<p>internal loss. This loss is frequency dependent. Accordingly, the net gain and the
</p>
<p>output power of free-electron lasers operating at wavelengths below a few micrometer
</p>
<p>can strongly depend on frequency. In our discussion of the laser power, we consider
</p>
<p>maximum values reported, since these occur when internal loss has a small influence
</p>
<p>on gain and power.
</p>
<p>We conclude from the analysis that an electron generates 104&ndash;107 photons during
</p>
<p>the flight through the wiggler at steady state oscillation of a free-electron laser.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, in the last part of the gain region of the wiggler, more than one photon
</p>
<p>per period of electron oscillation is generated.
</p>
<p>Thus, the modulation model provides data for the saturation field amplitude that
</p>
<p>are, in principle, in accord with laser data known from experimental and design
</p>
<p>parameters. Experimental data for gain coefficients are in accord with the modulation
</p>
<p>model if we take account of the appropriate values of the current strength and the mode
</p>
<p>area of different lasers. We summarize results obtained by applying the modulation
</p>
<p>model.
</p>
<p>&bull; The gain coefficient varies asω&minus;3/2 (for fixed Kw andλw and fixed current density).
&bull; The saturation field amplitude varies as ω3/2 (for fixed Kw and λw).
&bull; The modulation model contains a parameter, the distortion energy E&lowast;, which we
</p>
<p>adjust to experimental data or design data of free-electron lasers; for a derivation
</p>
<p>of the distortion energy, see Problem 19.16.
</p>
<p>&bull; The product of the gain coefficient and the saturation field amplitude is a constant
that contains only the wiggler parameter and the modal current density; the constant
</p>
<p>is independent of frequency and of the distortion energy.
</p>
<p>&bull; At steady state oscillation of a free-electron laser, the orbit of an electron undergoes
a transition into a distorted oscillation state if the electron traverses the saturation
</p>
<p>range of the wiggler.
</p>
<p>&bull; The modulation model seems to be applicable for characterization of lasers as well
as of SASE free-electron lasers, that is, from millimeter waves to X-rays&mdash;see next
</p>
<p>section.
</p>
<p>19.11 Modulation Model and SASE Free-Electron Lasers
</p>
<p>In this section, we ask the question whether the modulation model is suitable to
</p>
<p>describe SASE free-electron lasers. There are worldwide many SASE free-electron
</p>
<p>lasers in operation or in planning. We will compare data following from the modu-
</p>
<p>lation model with experimental or design data of two SASE free-electron lasers:
</p>

<p>SASE free-electron laser, simulation data, published in 2007 [173], see also https://
</p>
<p>portal.slac.stanford.edu for information about operating free-electron lasers at
</p>
<p>SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford.
</p>
<p>According to the modulation model, the gain coefficient is given by
</p>
<p>α =
π K 2w Iel
</p>
<p>4ε0 (E&lowast;/e) amode γ ω
, (19.103)
</p>
<p>and the saturation field amplitude by
</p>
<p>Asat =
(E&lowast;/e) γ ω
</p>
<p>π c Kw
. (19.104)
</p>
<p>We choose the same value for the distortion energy E&lowast; as for the free-electron lasers
discussed in the preceding section; the saturation field amplitude is most likely vary-
</p>
<p>ing less strongly with frequency as discussed in Problem 19.17.
</p>
<p>Example 1 5.8 nm SASE FEL (Flash, Hamburg).ν = 5 &times; 1016 Hz, hν = 200 eV,
Eel = 1.1 GeV, γ = 2.1 &times; 103, Lw = 27 m, λw = 2.7 cm, Kw = 1.1,
Iel = 80 A, tp = 20 fs, Pout = 1 &times; 109 W. The Flash FEL produces radiation of a
relative spectral width of 1%. The wiggler consists of periodically arranged magnets
</p>
<p>at constant period. During the transit through the wiggler, an electron loses 1% of
</p>
<p>its initial energy, corresponding to 11 MeV. We conclude that an electron generates
</p>
<p>5 &times; 104 photons by stimulated emission, i.e., that the gain of radiation is equal to
G = 5 &times; 104. The number of photons in a pulse is equal to Z = Pout/hν= 3 &times; 1011.
Thus, the initial number of spontaneously emitted photons is of the order of 107.
</p>
<p>It follows from the value of the gain that the modal gain coefficient is equal to
</p>
<p>α = 0.4 m&minus;1. This value follows from (19.103) for E&lowast;/e = 2 V if we assume a
radiation beam diameter of ru = 0.06 mm. The power generated by the SASE FEL
is much smaller than the saturation field (Asat = 1012 V m&minus;1), which follows from
(19.104).
</p>
<p>Example 2 0.15 nm SASE-FEL [173]; ν = 2 &times; 1018 Hz, hν = 8 keV,
Eel = 13.6 GeV, γ = 2.7 &times; 104, Lw = 110 m, λw = 5.5 cm, Nw = 3.7 &times; 103,
Kw = 3.5, Iel = 3.4 kA, α = 0.23 m&minus;1. The modulation model provides the same
gain coefficient if we assume the values E&lowast;/e = 2 V and ru = 0.9 mm. However,
a gain of G = exp(αLw) cannot be realized because the output power of radiation
would exceed the input power contained in the electron beam. We estimate the power
</p>
<p>in a different way. We assume that 1% of the energy of an electron is converted to
</p>
<p>radiation by stimulated emission of radiation. This corresponds to an optical power
</p>
<p>of P = 460 GW. An electron pulse, assumed to have a duration of δt = 100 fs, con-
tains Ielδt/e (= 2 &times; 109) electrons. The number of photons in an optical pulse is
given by the relationship Ptp = Zhν. We assume that the optical pulse duration is
equal to the electron pulse duration, tp = δt , and find Z = 4 &times; 1013. It follows that
the gain is equal to G = 2 &times; 104. Each electron produces, by stimulated emission
of radiation, 2 &times; 104 photons. The saturation field that follows from (19.104) cannot</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>In conclusion, the modulation model may, in principle, be applicable for an illus-

</p>
<p>19.12 Onset of Oscillation of a Free-Electron Laser
</p>
<p>In this section, we discuss the onset of oscillation of a free-electron laser. We will
</p>
<p>find that the spectrum of radiation generated by a free-electron laser at steady state
</p>
<p>oscillation is determined by the dynamics during the onset of oscillation. We consider
</p>
<p>a continuous wave laser.
</p>
<p>The gain coefficient of the free-electron laser medium is time dependent:
</p>
<p>α (ω, t) = 2αm ḡL,disp(ω, t) = 2αm
(ω0 &minus; ω) Δω0(t)/2
</p>
<p>(ω0 &minus; ω)2 +Δω20(t)/4
. (19.105)
</p>
<p>The maximum gain coefficient, αm, is independent of time. However, Δω0 depends
</p>
<p>on time.
</p>
<p>The first electron pulses propagating through the wiggler at time t = 0 excite,
by spontaneous emission of radiation, modes of the laser resonator according to the
</p>
<p>spectrum of spontaneously emitted radiation (Fig. 19.15). Stimulated emission of
</p>
<p>radiation sets in at time t &asymp; 0.The initial rate of stimulated emission processes is very
small. Therefore, at t &asymp; 0, the widthΔω0 of the gain coefficient curve is very narrow.
Accordingly, initial stimulated emission of radiation occurs in a narrow frequency
</p>
<p>range near ω0; the gain coefficient has the shape of the normalized general Lorentz
dispersion function. With increasing number of transits of the radiation through
</p>
<p>the wiggler, the rate τ&minus;1 (= τ&minus;1stim) of stimulated emission processes increases. An
increasing stimulated emission rate leads to broadening of the gain curve and a shift
</p>
<p>of the maximum of the gain coefficient curve (and of the maximum of the frequency
</p>
<p>distribution of radiation generated by stimulated emission) toward smaller frequency.
</p>
<p>At the oscillation onset time, ton, the amplitude of the high frequency electric field is
</p>
<p>equal to the saturation field amplitude Asat. During the onset of laser oscillation, the
</p>
<p>center frequency of the radiation in the resonator shifts from a value near ω0 to the
</p>
<p>frequency of maximum gain, assumed to be near the center frequency ωc of the laser
</p>
<p>oscillation range &lt; ω1, ω0 &gt;. The lower limit of the laser oscillation range occurs
</p>
<p>because spontaneous emission at ω1 is absent. In the vicinity of this frequency, the
</p>
<p>spontaneous emission is too week to initiate strong laser oscillation, i.e. there is a
</p>
<p>bottleneck in the spontaneous emission of radiation at frequencies around ω1 and at
</p>
<p>smaller frequencies.</p>

<p>radiation and gain coefficient. Center, onset of oscillation of a single line free-electron laser. Right,
</p>
<p>onset of oscillation of a pulsed (mode locked) free-electron laser
</p>
<p>In a pulsed laser, the spectral width of the frequency distribution grows during the
</p>
<p>buildup of laser oscillation and corresponds to about Δω0/2 &asymp; ω0/2Nw. The width
Δω0 of the gain coefficient curve characterizing an ensemble of electrons increases
</p>
<p>exponentially with time (Fig. 19.16). If the critical modulation index is reached,
</p>
<p>the ensemble loses its conductivity. Then stimulated emission and absorption of
</p>
<p>radiation determine the behavior of the electron ensemble. Accordingly, during the
</p>
<p>initial propagation of electron pulses through the wiggler, the width Δω0 of the
</p>
<p>radiation field increases with time until it reaches a value that is slightly smaller than
</p>
<p>ω0/Nw.
</p>
<p>The gain per transit of radiation through the active medium is equal to
</p>
<p>G &minus; 1 = exp(α Leff)&minus; 1. (19.106)
</p>
<p>G is the gain factor, G &minus; 1 the gain, α the modal gain coefficient, and Leff is an effec-
tive length. The effective length changes during the onset of oscillation (Fig. 19.17):
</p>
<p>G &minus; 1 = exp(α Lw)&minus; 1, small-signal gain; Leff = Lw.
G &minus; 1 = exp(αLw/2)&minus; 1, intermediate gain (at t = ton); Leff = Lw/2.
G&infin; = exp(αLw/3), large-signal gain at steady state oscillation of the laser; Leff =
Lw/3.
</p>
<p>At begin of the onset of laser oscillation (at t &asymp; 0), radiation is amplified along the
whole wiggler length. In the intermediate range, the modulation current density is</p>

<p>Dephasing between an electron oscillation in a free-electron medium and a high

<p>frequency electric field occurs because the frequency ω0 of the electron oscillation
</p>
<p>is different from the frequency ω of the field.

<p>difference Δω/ω0. A stimulated emission process, which occurs preferably if φ &asymp;
π, causes a change of the phase (Fig. 19.19b). With increasing amplitude of the

<p>high frequency electric field, stimulated emission processes follow each other rapidly
</p>

frequency ω0. Interaction of the electron with the high frequency electric field

<p>The modulation model provides the real part of the dynamical conductivity of a

<p>free-electron laser medium. In order to determine the imaginary part, we apply the
</p>
<p>Kramers-Kronig relations (Sect. 9.11). If the shape of the real part of a physical

<p>response function is a general Lorentz dispersion function, then the shape of the
</p>
<p>imaginary part is a general Lorentz resonance function. In the case that ωτ &lt;&lt; 1,
</p>
<p>we can approximate, in the vicinity of a resonance, the general complex Lorentz

<p>Real and imaginary part of the dynamical conductivity are shown in Fig. 19.21. The
</p>
<p>real part of the high frequency conductivity shows a dispersive behavior as derived

<p>in Sect. 19.7. The imaginary part shows a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; peak with the peak value &minus;2σm

<p>It follows that the components of the complex refractive index ñ = n1 &minus; in2 are

</p>
<p>Figure 19.23 shows the result of our study of the onset of laser oscillation. At steady
</p>
<p>state oscillation, the spectral intensity profile F2(ω) of the laser radiation extends
</p>
<p>fromω1 = ω0 &minus;Δω0 toω0.The center frequency isωc.The spectral intensity profile
shows a maximum near ωc. The halfwidth of the spectral distribution is equal to
</p>
<p>Δω &asymp; Δω0/2. All resonator modes with frequencies in the laser oscillation range
(of width ω0/Nw) oscillate synchronously.
</p>
<p>A sequence of electron pulses is driving a laser oscillation. Each pulse of the
</p>
<p>sequence propagates only once through the wiggler. Interaction of an electron pulse
</p>
<p>with the high frequency electric field in the laser resonator modifies the electron
</p>
<p>pulse. We now will specify the modifications. We suppose that the electron beam
</p>
<p>and the optical beam have the same Gaussian shape in time and, furthermore, the
</p>
<p>same Gaussian shape in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis (=resonator axis).
We assume, for simplicity, that the beams are parallel beams. For a treatment of
</p>
<p>the dynamics, we simplify further: we replace the Gaussian shape by a rectangular
</p>
<p>shape.
</p>
<p>An optical pulse circulates in the resonator and propagates at the same time
</p>
<p>through the wiggler as an electron pulse (Fig. 19.24a). The repetition rate of the elec-
</p>
<p>tron pulses is equal to the reciprocal of the round trip transit time of the optical pulse
</p>
<p>within the laser resonator. An electron pulse and an optical pulse have lengths that are
</p>
<p>small compared with the wiggler length. An optical pulse, which propagates slightly
</p>
<p>faster than a corresponding electron pulse, enters the wiggler immediately after the
</p>
<p>corresponding electron pulse (Fig. 19.24b). The two pulses overlap completely at the
</p>
<p>center of the wiggler. The electron pulse leaves the wiggler immediately after the
</p>
<p>optical pulse leaves. An electron pulse in the wiggler represents the active medium.
</p>
<p>The active medium propagates through the wiggler with a velocity near the speed
</p>
<p>of light. During the flight of the active medium (i.e., of an electron pulse) through
</p>
<p>the wiggler, the optical pulse propagates through the active medium. Interaction of</p>

<p>the high frequency electric field of the optical pulse and the electrons of an electron

<p>pulse occurs during the whole flight of the two pulses through the wiggler. At the
</p>
<p>end of the wiggler, the interaction finishes, because of absence of a spatially periodic
</p>
<p>magnetic field.
</p>
<p>A portion of radiation is coupled out from the laser resonator by means of an output

<p>coupling mirror. The radiation generated by the mode locked free-electron laser is
</p>
<p>a coherent pulse train. Each time an electron pulse travels through the wiggler, the

<p>optical pulse is amplified: at steady state oscillation of the mode locked free-electron
</p>
<p>laser, the optical gain per single transit is equal to the loss per round trip transit
</p>
<p>through the resonator.
</p>
<p>At steady state oscillation of a mode locked free-electron laser, different modi-

<p>fications of the pulses occur in three regions of the wiggler, each with a length of

<p>about one third of the wiggler length:

</p>
<p>The pulse duration is equal to the product of the number of wiggler periods and the

</p>
<p>The pulse train of a mode locked free-electron laser consists of short pulses. When
</p>
<p>a Gaussian beam interacts with an electron beam, then the Gaussian beam experiences
</p>
<p>a self-focusing (light guiding) effect during the flight through the gain region of the
</p>
<p>electron pulse. Spreading of the optical pulse with respect to the temporal and the
</p>
<p>lateral shape during a transit through the free-electron medium is repaired by the
</p>
<p>following transits; the electron beam acts as an aperture in a conventional phase
</p>
<p>locked laser. The Gouy phase shift changes the temporal shape of a pulse in a pulse
</p>
<p>train, each time a pulse propagates through the wiggler.

<p>19.16 Electron Bunching
</p>
<p>Synchronization of the transverse oscillations to the high frequency electric field leads
</p>
<p>also to synchronization of the longitudinal oscillations according to the rigid coupling
</p>
<p>of the transverse and the longitudinal oscillation of an electron. It follows that the
</p>
<p>transverse modulation current of an electron is joined with a longitudinal modulation
</p>
<p>current of the electron. In an ensemble of electrons, a longitudinal modulation current
</p>
<p>density is built up in the synchronization region of the wiggler. Accordingly, the
</p>
<p>electrons form bunches (microbunches) along the z direction. At a fixed location in
</p>
<p>the wiggler, the electron distribution, N (t), is enhanced in temporal distances of half
</p>
<p>the period of the optical field and reduced in the regions in between (Fig. 19.25).
</p>
<p>This corresponds to bunching along the z axis, with two electron bunches every
</p>
<p>wavelength of the optical field.
</p>
<p>At steady state oscillation of a free-electron laser, electrons enter the wiggler
</p>
<p>at different times. The high frequency electric field, which propagates through the
</p>
<p>electron beam, leads to buildup of bunches within the first third of the wiggler. In
</p>
<p>the second third of the wiggler, the electron bunches become more pronounced and
</p>
<p>mediate gain for the optical field. In the third part of the wiggler, electron bunches
</p>
<p>persist. Then, stimulated emission and absorption of radiation compensate each other.</p>

<p>Medium
</p>
<p>At begin of this section, we introduce the hypothesis: A transverse oscillation of a
</p>
<p>free-electron propagating through a spatially periodic magnetic field can be described
</p>
<p>as a quantum system, namely as an energy-ladder system. Characteristic of an energy-
</p>
<p>ladder system is the equidistance of the energy levels. An electron occupies one level
</p>
<p>of the corresponding energy-ladder system. (A motivation for the thesis will be given
</p>
<p>at the end of this section.)
</p>
<p>Characteristic of an energy-ladder system (Fig. 19.26a), are the energy levels
</p>
<p>El = l E0, (19.116)
</p>
<p>where l is an integer and
</p>
<p>E0 = hν0 (19.117)
</p>
<p>is the transition energy, i.e., the energy distance between two next-near energy lev-
</p>
<p>els. Electromagnetic radiation interacts via spontaneous emission, absorption, and
</p>
<p>stimulated emission according to the Einstein coefficients. However, absorption and
</p>
<p>stimulated emission processes have the same transition probability (Fig. 19.26b).
</p>
<p>Therefore, the average rate of absorption processes is the same as the average rate of
</p>
<p>stimulated emission processes if the phase of the radiation is equal to the resonance
</p>
<p>frequency, i.e., if ν = ν0. The description as a phase modulation (Sect. 19.7) indicates
that stimulated emission prevails if ν &lt; ν0 and absorption if ν &gt; ν0. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>the gain coefficient curve is not a Lorentz resonance curve but a Lorentz dispersion
</p>
<p>curve.
</p>
<p>In a strong electromagnetic field, transitions between next near levels are also
</p>
<p>allowed as multiphoton transitions (Fig. 19.26c) corresponding to the condition
</p>
<p>nhν = hν0; n = 1, 2, ... . (19.118)

<p>We have the following possibilities.
</p>
<p>&bull; A radiation field experiences a population inversion if hν &lt; E0 (see Fig. 19.26d).
In a stimulated emission process by radiation at the frequency ν by an l &rarr; l &minus; 1

</p>
<p>energy, Edist, connected with a single-photon transition:
</p>
<p>E0 = hν + Edist. (19.119)

<p>Absorption does not occur since the states of distortion are almost unpopulated,

<p>i.e., the upper laser level has an occupation number of nearly unity, f2 &asymp; 1, and
the lower level of nearly zero, f1 &asymp; 0. After a stimulated emission process, the

In an absorption process, a photon is converted into excitation energy E0 and energy

<p>hν = E0 + Edist. (19.121)

</p>
<p>&bull; If hν = E0, upward and downward transitions are equally strong and there is no
net energy transfer from the field to the electrons and vice versa.

<p>The states belonging to an energy-ladder system are transient states according to the

<p>finite time of flight of an electron through the wiggler. However, the time of flight of
</p>
<p>an electron through the wiggler is by many orders of magnitude larger than the period

<p>of a free-electron oscillation. A description of a transversely oscillating electron by

<p>Table 19.2 shows values of Einstein coefficients characterizing transitions between
</p>
<p>energy-ladder levels of a free-electron laser medium. The data are obtained for a
</p>
<p>free-electron laser presented in Sect. 19.6 (Table 19.1). The Einstein coefficient of
</p>
<p>stimulated emission is larger than that of active media of conventional lasers (for a
</p>
<p>comparison, see Table 6.1 in Sect. 6.5).
</p>
<p>The gain cross section σ21(ω) has the same frequency dependence as the gain
</p>
<p>coefficient. The maximum gain cross section is σ21,m = αm/N0 (= 2 &times; 10&minus;18 m2).
In comparison, a naturally broadened two-level system propagating with a velocity
</p>
<p>corresponding to a Lorentz factor γ̄ would have a gain cross section 4γ̄ 2λ2/2π
</p>
<p>(&sim;10&minus;7 m2).
The states belonging to an energy-ladder system are transient states according to
</p>
<p>the finite time of flight of an electron through the wiggler. However, the time of flight
</p>
<p>is by many orders of magnitude larger than the period of a free-electron oscillation.
</p>
<p>An illustration of a free-electron medium as an ensemble of energy-ladder sytems
</p>
<p>may therefore be justified.
</p>
<p>Figure 19.28 is a modified version of the preceding figure. A beam of electrons
</p>
<p>of energy Eel,0 enters the wiggler. In the synchronization region, each electron loses,
</p>
<p>on average, a small amount of energy due to synchronization by stimulate emission
</p>
<p>of radiation. The electrons then enter the gain region with nearly the original energy.
</p>
<p>In the gain region, an electron loses energy of longitudinal motion due to a cas-
</p>
<p>cade of stimulated emission processes. In the saturation region, the electron energy
</p>
<p>remains almost unchanged although the transition rate of electronic transitions is
</p>
<p>large: a fast cascade of absorption processes follows on a fast cascade of stimulated
</p>
<p>emission processes. Absorption compensates stimulated emission. A fast cascade of
</p>
<p>stimulated emission processes occurs during a period of the electron oscillation and
</p>
<p>a fast cascade of absorption processes during the following period. A fast cascade
</p>
<p>of stimulated emission processes is joined with a distorted state of an electron. The
</p>
<p>reversed process leads back to the undistorted state.</p>

<p>and the saturation region of the wiggler (with a fast cascade of absorption processes following on
</p>
<p>a fast cascade of stimulated emission processes, in turn)
</p>
<p>In order to discuss the saturation behavior, we estimate the time between two
</p>
<p>stimulated emission processes. The electron transit rate is equal to rel = Iel/e. The
power of an electron is given by Pel = U Iel, where U is the voltage that corresponds
to the electron energy. The power of the radiation emitted by the laser is equal to
</p>
<p>Pout = ηPel,whereη is the efficiency of the laser. The rate of photon emission is given
by rph = Pout/(hν). The average time between two stimulated emission processes is
equal to
</p>
<p>τstim =
rel
</p>
<p>rph
ttr =
</p>
<p>(hν/e) ttr
</p>
<p>ηU
, (19.128)
</p>
<p>where ttr is the transit time, i.e., the time an electron takes for a transit through the
</p>
<p>wiggler.
</p>
<p>Example 1.6 &micro;m FEL, pulsed laser; ν = 188 THz, hν = 0.8 eV, U = 115 MV,
Lw = 2 m, ttr = 6 ns, Iel = 100 A, η = 2 &times; 10&minus;2, Pout = 200 MW. We find
τstim = 2 &times; 10&minus;15s.
</p>
<p>The time given in the example is about equal to half the period of the electron
</p>
<p>oscillation. Since the time τstim is an average taken over the time of flight of an electron
</p>
<p>through the whole wiggler, the time between two stimulated emission processes is
</p>
<p>much shorter in the final part of the gain region and, accordingly, in the saturation
</p>
<p>region. Thus, the assumption of a fast cascade of stimulated emission processes
</p>
<p>within one period of an electron oscillation cycle appears to be justified. The work
</p>
<p>E&lowast; done by an electron in a cascade corresponds to stimulated emission of a number
of photons. We can estimate this number n of photons involved in a cascade process
</p>
<p>within the saturation region of the wiggler assuming that the distortion energy is about
</p>
<p>equal to the energy of the phonons, n hν &asymp; E&lowast;. The number n (&asymp; E&lowast;/hν &asymp; 3 for
the 1.6 &micro;m FEL and for E&lowast; = 2 V) increases with decreasing frequency. If the energy
of a photon is larger than E&lowast;, then saturation is expected if τstim is smaller than the
period of the electron oscillation. According to (19.127), the time τstim increases</p>

</p>
<p>proportional to U . Therefore, saturation of a SASE X-ray free-electron laser does
</p>
<p>not occur: τstim is larger than the period of the electron oscillation. This result is in
</p>
<p>accord with the conclusion that the saturation field cannot be reached in a SASE
</p>
<p>X-ray free-electron laser (Sect. 19.11).
</p>
<p>Here, we discuss the motivation for the introduction of an energy-ladder system.
</p>
<p>It is known that a free-electron in a crystal propagating through a periodic electric
</p>
<p>potential can be described as a quantum system. The energy levels of the electron form
</p>
<p>an energy-ladder system, a Wannier-Stark ladder [274]. The levels are energetically
</p>
<p>equidistant.
</p>
<p>There is a formal connection between a theoretically well studied superlattice
</p>
<p>Bloch laser and a free-electron laser:
</p>
<p>&bull; The active medium of a superlattice Bloch laser (Chap. 32) consists of an ensemble
of free-electrons in a spatially periodic electric potential. The electrons execute,
</p>
<p>under the action of a static electric field and the periodic potential, free-electron
</p>
<p>oscillations. An electromagnetic field modulates the free-electron oscillations,
</p>
<p>which leads to a synchronization of the free-electron oscillations to the field and
</p>
<p>to gain for the field. The gain coefficient curve is a Lorentz dispersion curve.
</p>
<p>The states of an electron subject to both a periodic potential and a static field are
</p>
<p>quantum mechanical describable as Wannier&ndash;Stark states. The energy levels of
</p>
<p>an electron form a Wannier&ndash;Stark ladder&mdash;i.e., an energy-ladder with equidistant
</p>
<p>energy levels [175, 274]. An electron occupies one of the levels. A stimulated
</p>
<p>transition occurs from the occupied Wannier&ndash;Stark level to an intermediate level
</p>
<p>that corresponds to the distorted level of the energetically next near level of lower
</p>
<p>energy (Sect. 32.7 and [272]).
</p>
<p>&bull; The active medium of a free-electron laser consists of an ensemble of Free-
electrons that execute, under the action of a periodic magnetic field, free-electron
</p>
<p>oscillations. An electromagnetic field modulates the free-electron oscillations,
</p>
<p>which leads to a synchronization of the free-electron oscillations to the field and
</p>
<p>to gain of the field. The gain coefficient curve is a Lorentz dispersion curve. We
</p>
<p>introduced&mdash;on the basis of the similarity of the formal description of the free-
</p>
<p>electron oscillations in a free-electron laser and the free-electron oscillations in a
</p>
<p>Bloch laser as monopole oscillations&mdash;an energy-ladder description.
</p>
<p>The transverse oscillation of an electron in a free-electron laser and a Bloch
</p>
<p>oscillation of an electron in a semiconductor superlattice have in common that the
</p>
<p>oscillations are monopole oscillations. An external perturbation can change the phase
</p>
<p>of the oscillation of a monopole oscillator, but not the amplitude. In comparison, an
</p>
<p>external perturbation can change the amplitude and the phase of a dipole oscillator.
</p>
<p>We used a dipole oscillator as a classical model of a two-level system. In an analogous
</p>
<p>way, a monopole oscillator may be seen as a classical model of an energy-ladder
</p>
<p>system. It is an open question, whether it is possible to develop a theory of transient
</p>
<p>energy states for relativistic electrons in a spatially periodic magnetic field.</p>

<p>19.18 Aspects of Free-Electron Laser Theory
</p>
<p>Quantum effects taking account of the recoil of an electron due to emission of a
</p>
<p>photon are expected to be important for free-electron lasers generating radiation at
</p>
<p>short X-ray wavelengths. Theoretical aspects have been treated in various studies,
</p>
<p>for instance in [175, 176, 325, 326].
</p>
<p>Analysis of a free-electron laser is possible on basis of Maxwell&rsquo;s equations
</p>
<p>together with laws of classical equations describing interaction of an accelerated
</p>
<p>or decelerated relativistic electron with an electromagnetic field. The equations are
</p>
<p>solvable by using methods of numerical simulation; for a treatment of a free-electron
</p>
<p>laser by a three-dimensional simulation, see, for instance, [326].
</p>
<p>The equations of motion of electrons in the limit of negligibly small electromag-
</p>
<p>netic fields can approximately solved in a one-dimensional description and provide
</p>
<p>the gain [5, 166, 312]:

<p>The gain curve (Fig. 19.29) is antisymmetric with respect to the resonance frequency
</p>
<p>X = 0; there is no gain at the resonance frequency ω0. The gain curve shows a
modulation according to the finite time of flight of the electrons through the wiggler.

<p>The lineshape function g(X) is equal to the derivative of the function that describes
</p>
<p>the spectral distribution of spontaneously emitted radiation. (This is sometimes called
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madey theorem&rdquo;.) Maximum gain, G0m &minus; 1, occurs at a frequency (Xm &asymp; &minus; 2.6)
slightly smaller than the resonance frequency. The frequency distance (ΔX0 &asymp; 5.2)

</p>
<p>In comparison, the small-signal gain derived on basis of the equations of motion is

<p>proportional to N 2w while the small-signal gain following from the modulation model
</p>
<p>is inversely proportional to the distortion energy E&lowast;. (There is also a difference in the
dependence on the wiggler parameter.) The two expressions lead to the same mag-
</p>
<p>nitude of the gain for Nw = 140. Thus, the gain determined by the two expressions
is, for wiggler periods of the order of 100, on the same order of magnitude.
</p>
<p>Example 1.6 &micro;m FEL, see, Example 1, Sect. 19.10. ν = 188 THz, Eel =
115 MeV, γ = 230, Nw = 30, Lw = 1.65 m, λw = 5.5 cm, Kw = 0.64, Iel =
100 A, L res = 30 m, 1 &minus; R = 0.1, L res = 30 m, ru = 2 mm. We find GMTm &minus; 1 =
0.012 and GMMm &minus; 1 = 0.7.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>400 19 Free-Electron Laser
</p>
<p>The gain G0m &minus; 1 is proportional to the length of the wiggler Lw and, additionally,
proportional to the square of the number Nw of wiggler periods. This dependence
</p>
<p>corresponds, for a free-electron laser driven by short electron pulses, to a gain that
</p>
<p>is proportional to Lw and additionally, to Nw since the width of the laser oscillation
</p>
<p>interval decreases as 1/Nw. The gain G
MM
m &minus; 1 is also proportional to the length of
</p>
<p>the wiggler. But it shows no additional dependence on Nw. This corresponds to a
</p>
<p>gain coefficient that is a local quantity. During the onset of laser oscillation GMMm &minus; 1
remains constant while the spectrum of radiation broadens, joined with a shift of the
</p>
<p>maximum.
</p>
<p>An experimental study [168] (performed in the High Energy Physics Laboratory,
</p>
<p>Stanford University) provided a gain curve that is in accordance with the theoretical
</p>
<p>curve (Fig. 19.31). In the experiment, CO2 laser radiation (wavelength 10.6 &micro;m)
</p>
<p>propagated through a spatially periodic magnet field (strength 0.24 T, period 3.2 cm,
</p>
<p>wiggler length 5.2 m) and interacted with an electron beam (24 MeV) that consisted
</p>
<p>of pulses (peak current 0.1 A). The electron energy was swept through a range in the
</p>
<p>vicinity of 24 MeV. The gain (during an electron pulse) was 7%. The power of the
</p>
<p>transmitted radiation increased by a value (4 &times; 103 W), which was 109 times larger
than the power of spontaneously emitted radiation.
</p>
<p>Shortly after the observation of amplification, the same laboratory published the
</p>
<p>first successful operation of a free-electron laser [169]. The arrangement was the
</p>
<p>same as for the amplification experiment, with two differences: the electrons had
</p>
<p>a larger energy (43 MeV) and radiation was stored in a laser resonator. Infrared
</p>
<p>radiation (wavelength 3.4 &micro;m, relative spectral width 10&minus;2) had a power of 5 &times; 105
W within the resonator (output mirror transmissivity 1.5%) that was much larger than
</p>
<p>the power of the CO2 laser radiation used for the amplification experiment. [John
</p>
<p>Madey once explained me (K.F.R.) in his laboratory in Stanford: a laser experiment
</p>
<p>is much easier to perform than an amplification experiment.]
</p>
<p>Now, we mention the pendulum model of the free-electron laser. The model fol-
</p>
<p>lows as a one-dimensional approximation of the equations of motion of an elec-
</p>
<p>tron in a periodic magnetic field and a high frequency electric field: the equa-
</p>
<p>tions of motion are given in the Problems to this chapter. The pendulum model
</p>
<p>(not treated in this book) provides a saturation field amplitude APMsat that corre-
</p>
<p>sponds to the criterion: in a passage through the wiggler, an electron can lose
</p>
<p>the maximum energy leading to a relative shift of the resonance frequency by
</p>
<p>(Δω0/2)/ω0 = 1/2Nw. This corresponds to an efficiency of conversion of elec-
tron energy to radiation power of η = 1/2Nw. Accordingly, the maximum power
generated by a free-electron laser is equal to P = (1/2)cε0(APMsat )2πr2u (1 &minus; R). With
P = ηUl, we find APMsat = (2Ul)1/2(ηcε0πr2u (1 &minus; R)&minus;1/2. This saturation field ampli-
tude increases with the current strength.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.18 Aspects of Free-Electron Laser Theory 401
</p>
<p>Here, we summarize aspects treated by different models.
</p>
<p>&bull; Maxwell&rsquo;s theory together with theorems treating interaction of relativistic elec-
trons with electromagnetic fields; provides a complete description of a free-
</p>
<p>electron laser.
</p>
<p>&bull; Gain G0m &minus; 1 (often called small-signal gain of a free-electron laser) applies for
negligibly small fields; it corresponds to gain following from the equations of
</p>
<p>motion at weak high frequency field.
</p>
<p>&bull; The pendulum model provides an ultimate upper limit of the saturation field;
however, the field cannot be reached because the model ignores strong changes of
</p>
<p>the electron orbits in connection with saturation.
</p>
<p>&bull; The modulation model provides small-signal gain and saturation field and describes
onset of laser oscillation; the model assumes that stimulated emission of a photon
</p>
<p>results in a change of the phase of the electron oscillation and that saturation is
</p>
<p>due to strong distortions of the electron orbits. A determination of the distortion
</p>
<p>energy E&lowast; is performed by an analysis of free-electron laser data (Sect. 19.10).
Problem 19.16 presents a study that provides the magnitude of E&lowast; and the depen-
dence on the strength of the wiggler field and on the wiggler wavelength.
</p>
<p>19.19 Comparison of a Free-Electron Laser
</p>
<p>with a Conventional Laser
</p>
<p>We illustrate dynamical processes occurring in a conventional laser and a free-
</p>
<p>electron laser. We will use the two different aspects, one of them based on a quantum
</p>
<p>mechanical description and the other based on classical oscillator models.
</p>
<p>We consider, in the quantum mechanical description of a conventional laser, a
</p>
<p>two-level system (Fig. 19.30a). A pump process leads to population of the upper
</p>
<p>level. After a stimulated emission process and subsequent fast relaxation, the two-
</p>
<p>level system is unpopulated. A new pumping process leads again to population of
</p>
<p>the upper level. The processes occur repeatedly. Population inversion in an ensemble
</p>
<p>of two-level systems, which constitute the active medium of a laser, is a necessary
</p>
<p>condition of laser oscillation.
</p>
<p>In the quantum mechanical description of the free-electron laser (Fig. 19.30b), an
</p>
<p>electron occupies a level of an energy-ladder system. A stimulated emission process
</p>
<p>leads to occupation of a distorted state at an energy slightly larger (by the distortion
</p>
<p>energy Edist) than the energy of the next lower energy level. Stimulated emission
</p>
<p>processes occur repeatedly. Population inversion in an ensemble of energy-ladder
</p>
<p>systems, which constitute an active medium of a free-electron laser, is a necessary
</p>
<p>condition of free-electron laser oscillation.
</p>
<p>We now discuss classical oscillator models of the active medium in a laser and of
</p>
<p>the active medium in a free-electron laser. In a conventional laser, the polarization
</p>
<p>current of a dipole oscillator oscillates, at a phase of π, synchronously to the high
</p>
<p>frequency electric field (Fig. 19.31a). After a stimulated emission process (indicated</p>

<p>a Two-level system, with repeated processes of pumping, stimulated emission of a photon, and
</p>
<p>relaxation of the population of the lower level. b Energy-ladder system,
</p>
<p>by a star) and subsequent relaxation of the lower level of the corresponding two-
</p>
<p>level system, the dipole oscillator disappears. A pumping excitation of the upper
</p>
<p>level results again in a dipole oscillation with the polarization current oscillating,
</p>
<p>at the phase of π, synchronously to the field. In a free-electron laser, an electron
</p>
<p>performs a monopole oscillation at the resonance frequency that is slightly larger
</p>
<p>than the frequency of the high frequency field in the laser resonator (Fig. 19.31b).
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the phase between the electric current of an electron oscillator and the
</p>
<p>high frequency field increases with time. This dephasing is an inherent property of a
</p>
<p>free-electron laser medium.
</p>
<p>In a conventional laser, gain is mediated by a dielectric polarization of the active
</p>
<p>medium; during onset of laser oscillation the high frequency polarization grows
</p>
<p>together with the field. In a free-electron laser, gain is mediated by a high frequency
</p>
<p>electric current density; during onset of laser oscillation the high frequency current
</p>
<p>density grows together with the field.
</p>
<p>In our classical treatment of a conventional laser, we related quantum mechanical
</p>
<p>dipole transitions and classical dipole oscillators, octroying the effect of population
</p>
<p>inversion by an appropriate adjustment of the phase between a field and a dipole oscil-
</p>
<p>lator (Chap. 9). In our treatment of the free-electron laser, we reversed the procedure.
</p>
<p>We introduced electron-monopole oscillators as elementary oscillators in a free-
</p>
<p>electron laser medium and, then, the energy-ladder system as a quantum mechanical

<p>Fig. 19.32 Comparison of
</p>
<p>the saturation behavior, a of
</p>
<p>a two-level system showing a
</p>
<p>Rabi like oscillation and b of
</p>
<p>an energy-ladder system in a
</p>
<p>free-electron laser
</p>
<p>We finally compare the saturation behavior of a two-level system in a high fre-
</p>
<p>quency electric field and an energy-ladder system in a high frequency electric field.
</p>
<p>We assume that relaxation of the lower state of the two-level systems is absent
</p>
<p>(Fig. 19.32a). A transition from the upper level to the lower level by stimulated emis-
</p>
<p>sion of a photon follows a transition from the lower to the upper level by absorption
</p>
<p>of a photon. Stimulated emission and absorption follow each other. This behavior is
</p>
<p>consistent with the gain coefficient that is proportional to the population difference
</p>
<p>N2 &minus; N1 of an ensemble of two-level systems (Chap. 9). It is therefore also consis-
tent that the phase between polarization current and field is equal to π if a two-level
</p>
<p>system is in the upper state and that it is zero if the two-level system is in the lower
</p>
<p>state. In the case that a strong high frequency coherent field saturates an ensemble of
</p>
<p>two-level systems, the polarization and thus the polarization-current density follow
</p>
<p>the field coherently (see Problems to Chap. 9). Figure 19.32b illustrates saturation of
</p>
<p>a free-electron laser. A fast cascade of stimulated emission processes promotes an
</p>
<p>electron from a state with population inversion to a distorted state without population
</p>
<p>inversion. In the reversed process, a fast cascade of absorption processes promotes
</p>
<p>the electron back to the original level. Emission followed by absorption of radiation
</p>
<p>at a large amplitude of the high frequency electric field resembles the Rabi oscillation
</p>
<p>that is due to interaction of two-level systems with a strong high frequency electric
</p>
<p>field. (An analogy of the saturation behavior of a free-electron laser with a Rabi
</p>
<p>type of oscillation has already been suggested in connection with an analysis of a
</p>
<p>free-electron laser on basis of the pendulum model [312].)
</p>
<p>Table 19.4 indicates the main difference between a conventional laser and a free-
</p>
<p>electron laser: the elementary excitation of a conventional laser medium, on one hand,
</p>
<p>can be characterized as a two-level system and the elementary system of a free excita-
</p>
<p>tion of a free-electron laser medium, on the other hand, as an energy-ladder system.</p>

<p>&bull; Free-electron laser medium. The shape of the imaginary part of the response

<p>The lasers have in common that the laser field synchronizes the elementary oscil-

<p>19.20 Remark About the History of the Free-Electron
</p>
<p>Laser
</p>
<p>We mention a few data concerning the history of the free-electron laser.
</p>
<p>1933 P. Kapiza and P. Dirac discussed the possibility of stimulated Compton
</p>
<p>scattering.
</p>
<p>1951 H. Motz (Oxford) proposed to use a wiggler configuration for generation
</p>
<p>of incoherent radiation.
</p>
<p>1971/76 J. Madey (Stanford University) proposed a free-electron laser and realized
</p>
<p>the first free-electron laser (50 MeV LINAC; superconducting helical coil
</p>
<p>as wiggler magnet; wavelength of the radiation 3.4 &micro;m).
</p>
<p>1983 Petroff (Orsay) used radiation of a storage ring (150 MeV; the laser gen-
</p>
<p>erated visible radiation (wavelength 650 nm).
</p>
<p>1983 Stanford; 1 GeV LINAC.
</p>
<p>1983 Los Alamos; 1 GeV LINAC.
</p>
<p>1985 L. Elias et al. developed the free-electron laser in Santa Barbara, with a
</p>
<p>6 MeV static accelerator; the laser was the first tunable far infrared laser.</p>

</p>
<p>(a) Which is the Lorentz force, assuming that an electric field is absent?
</p>
<p>Answer: The Lorentz force is equal to F = qv &times; B, where q(= &minus;e) is the elec-
tron charge.

<p>(b) Determine the equation of motion of an electron (mass m0) moving at a relativis-
</p>
<p>tic velocity in a periodic magnetic field; assume that an optical field is absent

<p>Answer:

(γm0v) = qv &times; B. (19.138)

<p>Since the electron does not lose energy, the Lorentz factor is a constant and we

<p>Answer: The Lorentz force is equal to

<p>The electric field, which is oriented along the x direction, is given by

<p>19.16 Modulation model: an estimate of the distortion energy.
</p>
<p>We assume that the critical field amplitude A&lowast; plays a role for distortion of an electron
orbit that we described in connection with the modulation model.
</p>
<p>Characteristic of the modulation model is the distortion energy E&lowast;. We now
attribute the distortion energy a critical frequency ω&lowast; by the relationship
</p>
<p>�ω&lowast; = E&lowast;. (19.152)
</p>
<p>If an electron performs the work E&lowast;, then, stimulated emission of radiation can result
in a strong distortion of the electron orbit. We will differ between two cases:
</p>
<p>&bull; ω0 &le; ω&lowast;; the electron oscillation frequency ω0(&asymp; ω) is smaller or equal to the
critical frequency.
</p>
<p>&bull; ω0 &gt;&gt; ω&lowast;; the electron oscillation frequency is large compared with the critical
frequency (see Problem 19.17).
</p>
<p>Here, we consider the case that the electron oscillation frequency is equal or smaller
</p>
<p>than the critical frequency, ω0 &le; ω&lowast;. We ask for the work performed by an electron
submitted to the critical field using the relation

<p>(a) Determine E&lowast; and ω&lowast; for Bw = 1 T and λw = 1 cm; Kw &asymp; 1.
Answer.
</p>
<p>E&lowast; = 1eV. The calculated value of the distortion energy is comparable with the
value (2 eV) that we extracted, using the modulation model, from experimental

<p>(d) Determine the distortion energy, the critical frequency, and the coupling strength
</p>
<p>in the limits Kw &lt;&lt; 1 and Kw &gt;&gt; 1.
</p>
<p>(e) What is the reason that many expressions imply complicated dependences on
</p>
<p>the parameters; see, for instance the dependence of the distortion energy on the
</p>
<p>wiggler field and the wiggler wavelength.
</p>
<p>Answer. Complicated dependences stem mainly from the dependence of the laser
</p>
<p>frequency on the Lorentz factor, ω0(γ ).
</p>
<p>(f) What is the process that leads, according to the modulation model, to strong
</p>
<p>distortion of the electron orbit at saturation of the laser field?
</p>
<p>Answer. At saturated laser field, the work done by an electron during one period
</p>
<p>of the electron oscillation is equal to the distortion energy. During a period
</p>
<p>of the electron oscillation, one photon is generated if the electron oscillation
</p>
<p>frequency is about equal to the critical frequency, ω0 &asymp; ω&lowast;. Many photons are

</p>
<p>compared with the critical frequency. Then, the number n of photons generated

<p>in a cascade process is given by the relationship nω0 &asymp; ω&lowast;. At saturated laser
field, an absorption process in a period of the electron oscillation follows a
</p>
<p>stimulated emission process occurring in the preceding period.
</p>
<p>Thus, the condition of saturation implies that stimulated emission and absorption

</p>
<p>An Introduction to Semiconductor Lasers
</p>
<p>Beginning with this chapter, we will treat semiconductor lasers&mdash;that are solid state
</p>
<p>lasers with active media based on semiconductor materials. We will concentrate our
</p>
<p>discussion on diode lasers (=laser diodes), that is, of current pumped semiconductor
</p>
<p>lasers and, in particular, on diode lasers operating at room temperature. These are
</p>
<p>presently the most important semiconductor lasers with respect to applications.
</p>
<p>There are two families of semiconductor lasers: the bipolar semiconductor lasers
</p>
<p>and the unipolar semiconductor lasers.
</p>
<p>The bipolar semiconductor lasers are two-band lasers. In a bipolar semiconductor
</p>
<p>laser, stimulated transitions between occupied electron levels in the conduction band
</p>
<p>and empty electron levels in the valence band generate the laser radiation. The photon
</p>
<p>energy of the laser radiation is about equal to the gap energy of the semiconductor.
</p>
<p>The unipolar semiconductor lasers, realized as quantum cascade lasers, belong to
</p>
<p>the three-level laser type. Electrons are performing transitions between three energy
</p>
<p>levels in three different subbands of the conduction band. The photon energy of the
</p>
<p>laser radiation is much smaller than the gap energy.
</p>
<p>We describe an electron in the conduction band of a semiconductor as a free
</p>
<p>electron, i.e., as an electron that can freely move (between two collisions) within a
</p>
<p>semiconductor. Accordingly, a hole in the valence band is a free hole. The freemotion
</p>
<p>of an electronor a hole is either three-dimensional (in a bulk crystal), two-dimensional
</p>
<p>(in a quantum film), one-dimensional (in a quantum wire) or zero-dimensional (in a
</p>
<p>quantum dot); in a quantum dot, freemotion of an electron is not possible, an electron
</p>
<p>is imprisoned in the quantum dot. The free motion of an electron in a direction is
</p>
<p>restricted if the extension of a semiconductor in the direction is, for a semiconductor
</p>
<p>at room temperature, about 10nm or smaller.
</p>
<p>The waveguide Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator, with reflectors formed by semiconductor
</p>
<p>surfaces only, is suitable as laser resonator for all types of bipolar lasers. Later
</p>
<p>(Chap. 25)wewill discuss other types of resonators that can be used in semiconductor
</p>
<p>lasers.

<p>416 20 An Introduction to Semiconductor Lasers
</p>
<p>We present the further program concerning semiconductor lasers. We will treat
</p>
<p>bipolar semiconductor lasers of different types: junction lasers, double heterostruc-
</p>
<p>ture lasers, quantum well lasers, quantum wire lasers and quantum dot lasers. The
</p>
<p>active media of the junction and double heterostructure lasers are three-dimensional
</p>
<p>semiconductors while the active media of the other types of bipolar lasers are semi-
</p>
<p>conductors of lower dimensions.
</p>
<p>We also give a short survey of the frequency ranges of the different semiconductor
</p>
<p>lasers and mention the energy band engineering as the basis of the great variety of
</p>
<p>semiconductor lasers.
</p>
<p>In comparison with other lasers, semiconductor lasers are unique with respect to
</p>
<p>their small sizes and, particularly, with respect to the possibility to design a semicon-
</p>
<p>ductor laser for a specific frequency&mdash;for any frequency in the near UV, visible and
</p>
<p>infrared. Realization of small-size semiconductor lasers is possible because both the
</p>
<p>Einstein coefficient B21 of stimulated emission and the density of two-level systems
</p>
<p>in an active semiconductor can have large values at the same time; in active media
</p>
<p>of other lasers, only one of the two quantities, either B21 or the density of two-level
</p>
<p>systems, has a large value.
</p>
<p>20.1 Energy Bands of Semiconductors
</p>
<p>We characterize (Fig. 20.1) a semiconductor by a conduction band c and a valence
</p>
<p>band v separated from each other by an energy gap:
</p>
<p>&bull; Ec = energy minimum of the conduction band.
</p>
<p>&bull; Ev = energy maximum of the valence band.
</p>
<p>&bull; Eg = Ec &minus; Ev = gap energy.
</p>
<p>Fig. 20.1 Conduction band and valence band</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.1 Energy Bands of Semiconductors 417
</p>
<p>We describe the electron states of the conduction band by free-electron waves
</p>
<p>ψ(k, r) = A ei[kr&minus;(E/�)t)], (20.1)
</p>
<p>where the quantities are:
</p>
<p>&bull; ψ = wave function.
</p>
<p>&bull; ψ&lowast;(r)ψ(r)dV = probability to find an electron in the state ψ at the location r in
</p>
<p>the volume element dV .
</p>
<p>&bull; A = amplitude of the electron wave.
</p>
<p>&bull; k = wave vector of the electron wave.
</p>
<p>&bull; r = spatial coordinate.
</p>
<p>&bull; E = energy.
</p>
<p>&bull; t = time.
</p>
<p>We characterize the relation between the energy and the k vector by a parabolic
</p>
<p>dispersion relation
</p>
<p>E = Ec + ǫc, (20.2)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>ǫc =
�
2k2
</p>
<p>2me
(20.3)
</p>
<p>is the energy within the conduction band, me the effective mass of a conduction band
</p>
<p>electron, and 1/mc the curvature of the dispersion curve in the energy minimum at
</p>
<p>k = 0. We can interpret ǫc as the kinetic energy of a conduction band electron.
</p>
<p>With respect to the valence band, we are only interested in the range near the
</p>
<p>band maximum. We describe the wave function of a valence band electron also as a
</p>
<p>free-electron wave, however with another dispersion relation,
</p>
<p>E = Ev &minus; ǫv, (20.4)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>ǫv =
�
2k2
</p>
<p>2mh
(20.5)
</p>
<p>is the energy of a valence band electron state measured from the top of the valence
</p>
<p>band, k is the wave vector, and mh the effective mass of a valence band electron at
</p>
<p>the top of the valence band.
</p>
<p>We denote an empty level in the valence band as a hole. The energy of a hole is
</p>
<p>equal to the energy of an electron in the valence band in the case that the electron
</p>
<p>occupies the empty level. The effective mass of a hole is equal to the effective mass
</p>
<p>of a valence band electron.</p>

<p>&bull; mh = 0.43m0 = effective mass of a hole (in the valence band)=mass of a valence

<p>band electron (on top of the valence band).
</p>
<p>&bull; mh &sim; 6me; the effective mass of a hole is about six times the effective mass of a
</p>
<p>conduction band electron.
</p>
<p>We utilize notations that are in use in semiconductor physics. A &ldquo;free-electron&rdquo; in
</p>
<p>a crystal is a conduction band electron (=electron in the conduction band) or a valence
</p>
<p>band electron (=electron in the valence band). We denote an ensemble of electrons
</p>
<p>in the conduction band as electron gas in the conduction band and, accordingly, an
</p>
<p>ensemble of electrons in the valence band as electron gas in the valence band.
</p>
<p>20.2 Low-Dimensional Semiconductors
</p>
<p>In a bulk semiconductor crystal, electrons move freely in space; we have a three-
</p>
<p>dimensional semiconductor (Fig. 20.2). The restriction of the free motion in one
</p>
<p>direction leads to a two-dimensional semiconductor realized as quantum well (=
</p>
<p>quantum film). The further restriction results in the one-dimensional semiconductor
</p>
<p>(quantum wire) and, finally, to the zero-dimensional semiconductor (quantum dot).
</p>
<p>Electrons in a quantum dot cannot move freely at all. The density of states (=level
</p>
<p>density) of electrons depends on the dimensionality of a semiconductor.
</p>
<p>&bull; Three-dimensional density of states= number of states per unit of energy and unit

</p>

</p>
<p>opposite spin) is taken into account. The density of states concern:
</p>
<p>&bull; Electrons in the conduction band; then ǫ = ǫc is the energy within the conduction
</p>
<p>band and m = me is the effective mass of a conduction band electron.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electrons or holes in the valence band near the top of the band; then ǫ = ǫv is
</p>
<p>the energy within the valence band and m = mh is the effective mass of a valence
</p>
<p>band electron (=effective mass of a hole in the valence band).
</p>
<p>20.3 An Estimate of the Transparency Density
</p>
<p>The effective mass of an electron in the conduction band and the effective mass of
</p>
<p>an electron in the valence band are quite different. Therefore, the density (=level
</p>
<p>density) for the of states in the conduction band differs strongly from the density of
</p>
<p>states for the valence band. We expect, according to the criterion used to determine
</p>
<p>the transparency density (Sect. 2.3), that the transparency density has a value between

</p>
<p>geometric average.)
</p>
<p>20.4 Bipolar and Unipolar Semiconductor Lasers
</p>
<p>In a bipolar semiconductor laser (Fig. 20.3a), the active medium contains nonequi-
</p>
<p>librium electrons in the conduction band and empty electron levels in the valence
</p>
<p>band. A current leads to injection of electrons into the conduction band and, at the
</p>
<p>same time, to extraction of electrons from the valence band. The electrons injected
</p>
<p>into the conduction band occupy mainly energy levels near the bottom of the con-
</p>
<p>duction band&mdash;while empty electron levels that occur due to extraction of electrons
</p>
<p>from the valence band accumulate at the top of the valence band. The electrons in the
</p>
<p>conduction band are in a quasithermal equilibrium at the temperature of the semi-
</p>
<p>conductor, and the electrons in the valence band are in a quasithermal equilibrium
</p>
<p>at the temperature of the semiconductor too. But the population of the conduction
</p>
<p>band is far out of equilibrium with respect to the population of the valence band.
</p>
<p>Stimulated transitions of electrons in the conduction band to empty electron levels
</p>
<p>in the valence band lead to generation of laser radiation. There is a distribution of
</p>
<p>transition energies E21. The smallest transition energy is the gap energy:
</p>
<p>E21 = E2 &minus; E1 &ge; Eg. (20.11)
</p>
<p>The range of transition energies is small compared to the gap energy. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>the photon energy of laser radiation generated by a bipolar semiconductor laser is
</p>
<p>comparable to the gap energy,
</p>
<p>hν &sim; Eg. (20.12)
</p>
<p>To cover the spectral ranges from the UV to the infrared with radiation of semicon-
</p>
<p>ductor lasers, semiconductors with quite different values of Eg are necessary. Thus,
</p>
<p>almost all semiconductors are candidates as basic materials of bipolar semiconductor
</p>
<p>lasers.
</p>
<p>But to be suitable as an active semiconductor medium, a semiconductor has to
</p>
<p>fulfill an important condition: the semiconductor must be a direct gap semiconductor.</p>

</p>
<p>semiconductors have direct gaps and are usable as laser media. In a direct gap semi-
</p>
<p>conductor, the conduction band minimum occurs at the same k value as the valence
</p>
<p>band maximum.
</p>
<p>In a unipolar semiconductor laser (Fig. 20.3b), electronic transitions between sub-
</p>
<p>bands of the conduction band of a semiconductor heterostructure generate the laser
</p>
<p>radiation. Now, the design of the heterostructure mainly determines the transition
</p>
<p>energy. There is again a distribution of transition energies. The transition energies
</p>
<p>are smaller than the gap energy,
</p>
<p>E21 = E2 &minus; E1 ≪ Eg, (20.13)
</p>
<p>and consequently, the laser frequencies are small compared to the gap frequency,
</p>
<p>hν ≪ Egap. (20.14)
</p>
<p>The unipolar laser realized as quantum cascade laser is available in frequency ranges
</p>
<p>of the infrared and far infrared.
</p>
<p>Table20.2 shows data of Einstein coefficients for GaAs-based semiconductor
</p>
<p>heterostructures. The values of B21 for bipolar semiconductor structure follow from
</p>
<p>A21 (known from fluorescence studies). Due to anisotropy of a heterostructure, the
</p>
<p>Einstein coefficient B21 is different for different orientations of the electromagnetic</p>

</p>
<p>well or a quantum wire, B

</p>
<p>21 can be larger than B21 (Sect. 22.8). The value of the
</p>
<p>Einstein coefficient of stimulated emission for a QCL medium can be derived from
</p>
<p>theory.
</p>
<p>20.5 Edge-Emitting Bipolar Semiconductor Lasers
</p>
<p>A edge-emitting bipolar semiconductor laser emits radiation from one of the edges
</p>
<p>of a device (or from two edges), see Fig. 20.4. The resonator corresponds (in the
</p>
<p>simplest case) to aFabry&ndash;Perot resonatorwith twouncovered semiconductor surfaces
</p>
<p>as reflectors. A central layer sandwiched between two other layers contains the active
</p>
<p>media. The central layer has a slightly larger refractive index (n0) than the adjacent
</p>
<p>layers (refractive index n1). The field is confined to the central layer, the laser light is
</p>
<p>index guided (=refractive index guided). The central layer has a thickness (a2) that
</p>
<p>is equal to half a wavelength or larger than half a wavelength of the laser radiation
</p>
<p>in the resonator. The reflectivity of a single surface is
</p>
<p>R1 = R2 =
(n0 &minus; 1)
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>(n0 + 1)2
. (20.15)
</p>
<p>The refractive index of a GaAs-based semiconductor is &sim;3.6 (or smaller) and the
</p>
<p>reflectivity of the surfaces R1 = R2 &sim; 0.3. The V factor characterizing the loss
</p>
<p>per single transit through the resonator is V1 &sim; 0.3. The laser threshold condition,
</p>
<p>G1V1 &ge; 1, requires that the gain factor at a single transit of radiation through a laser
</p>
<p>resonator must have a value G1 &ge; V
&minus;1
1 (&sim;3) that is noticeably larger than unity.
</p>

<p>The lifetime of a photon is slightly smaller than the time of flight (T/2) of the light

</p>
<p>20.6 Survey of Topics Concerning Semiconductor Lasers
</p>
<p>We will introduce (Fig. 20.5), on the basis of the properties of semiconductors and
</p>
<p>semiconductor heterostructures, the bipolar semiconductor lasers and the unipolar
</p>
<p>semiconductor lasers. We characterize the different types of the two families as types
</p>
<p>as follows.
</p>
<p>&bull; Junction laser (=homojunction laser = homostructure junction laser). The active
</p>
<p>medium is the junction region between an n-doped and a p-doped part of a crystal.
</p>
<p>This was the first semiconductor laser type.
</p>
<p>Example GaAs junction laser, containing an n GaAs/p GaAs junction.
</p>
<p>&bull; Double heterostructure laser. The active medium is an undoped film embedded
</p>
<p>in n- and p-doped materials. The undoped film is a well for electrons and holes.
</p>
<p>The thickness of the film is so large that the electrons move as free-electrons in all
</p>
<p>spatial directions. With this type, the laser design making use of heterostructures
</p>
<p>began.
</p>
<p>Example GaAs/GaAlAs laser, containing the layers n GaAlAs/GaAs/p GaAlAs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Quantum well laser. The active medium is an undoped quantum film. Adjacent to
</p>
<p>the quantum film, there is on one side n-doped material and on the other side p-
</p>
<p>doped material. The materials act as injectors of electrons and holes, respectively.
</p>
<p>Quantum well lasers are available for the visible, near infrared, and near UV spec-
</p>
<p>tral ranges and dominate presently the semiconductor laser field with respect to
</p>
<p>applications.

<p>424 20 An Introduction to Semiconductor Lasers
</p>
<p>Example GaAs quantum well laser, containing layers of n GaAlAs-2/n GaAlAs-
</p>
<p>1/GaAs/p GaAlAs-1/p GaAlAs-2; the numbers 1 and 2 refer to different
</p>
<p>compositions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Quantum wire laser. Quantumwire lasers, with quantumwires embedded in injec-
</p>
<p>tor material, are in the first stage of realization.
</p>
<p>&bull; Quantum dot laser. This type of a bipolar semiconductor laser is being developed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Quantum cascade laser (QCL). This laser type is presently in a very active state
</p>
<p>of development. The radiation of quantum cascade lasers covers large wavelength
</p>
<p>ranges of the infrared and the far infrared (2&ndash;28&micro;m) and, as cooled QCL, wave-
</p>
<p>length ranges of the far infrared (70&ndash;300&micro;m).
</p>
<p>&bull; Superlattice Bloch laser (=Bloch laser = Bloch oscillator). This type of laser
</p>
<p>exists only as an idea on the basis of theoretical studies. The active element is a
</p>
<p>doped semiconductor superlattice. The superlattice is composed of two different
</p>
<p>semiconductormaterials, for instance,GaAs andAlAs.An electron that propagates
</p>
<p>along the superlattice axis experiences a periodic potential. The energy is confined
</p>
<p>to a miniband of a width that is much smaller than the gap energy of the two
</p>
<p>semiconductors. In a strong static electric field (Es), the states of an electron in a
</p>
<p>miniband form an energy-ladder system. An electron occupies one of the levels in
</p>
<p>an energy-ladder system. Stimulated transitions between energetically next-year
</p>
<p>levels in the energy-ladder systems give rise to gain. Bloch lasers&mdash;if realizable&mdash;
</p>
<p>should operate at room temperature and cover a frequency range beginning at a
</p>
<p>frequency below 1THz up to several THz.
</p>
<p>We will begin in the next section with a discussion of a bipolar laser and then con-
</p>
<p>centrate the discussion during several chapters&mdash;because of its great importance&mdash;on
</p>
<p>the quantum well laser.
</p>
<p>20.7 Frequency Ranges of Semiconductor Lasers

</p>
<p>&bull; Superlattice Bloch laser (hypothetical); &sim;100&micro;m&ndash;1mm.
</p>
<p>In the wavelength range covered by quantum well lasers, there are other bipolar
</p>
<p>lasers such as quantumwire lasers, quantum dot lasers, double heterostructure lasers,
</p>
<p>and junction lasers.
</p>
<p>At present, there is a gapwith respect to semiconductor based oscillators operating
</p>
<p>at room temperature; the gap (&ldquo;terahertz gap&rdquo;) extends from about 30 &micro;m to 3mm
</p>
<p>(Sect. 28.7). The cooled quantum cascade lasers cover a part of the gap.</p>

<p>20.8 Energy Band Engineering
</p>
<p>An important tool used to design semiconductor lasers is the energy band engineering
</p>
<p>(tailoring of semiconductors), based on two principles.
</p>
<p>&bull; The use of mixed crystals. The energy gap of a mixed crystal is different from the
</p>
<p>gaps of the single components.
</p>
<p>&bull; The preparation of heterostructures. Heterostructures are spatial structures con-
</p>
<p>sisting of different semiconductor materials.
</p>
<p>20.9 Differences Between Semiconductor Lasers
</p>
<p>and Other Lasers
</p>
<p>Semiconductor lasers (=diode lasers = laser diodes) have a series of extraordinary
</p>
<p>properties.
</p>
<p>&bull; The transition energies can have, for different materials, very different values.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, lasers can be designed for the UV, visible, infrared, and far infrared
</p>
<p>spectral regions.
</p>
<p>&bull; The use of alloys of semiconductors makes it possible to design semiconductor
</p>
<p>lasers for each wavelength in the range from the near UV to the infrared.
</p>
<p>&bull; The use of heterostructures leads to an extraordinary extension of the possibility
</p>
<p>of designing lasers.
</p>
<p>A laser diode
</p>
<p>&bull; Converts electric current directly to light.
</p>
<p>&bull; Has a high gain coefficient (e.g., 10cm&minus;1 ormore), in comparisonwith the helium&ndash;
</p>
<p>neon laser (10&minus;3 cm&minus;1) or the CO2 laser (0.05cm
&minus;1), see Fig. 7.6.
</p>
<p>&bull; Can reach a high efficiency (50% or more).
</p>
<p>&bull; Operates as cw or pulsed laser.
</p>
<p>&bull; Can be tailored for a given wavelength.

<p>The combination of the radiation of a large number of semiconductor lasers leads
</p>
<p>to a high-power semiconductor laser; the radiation is monochromatic but not coher-
</p>
<p>ent.
</p>
<p>The other lasers have, in comparison with semiconductors, other advantages:
</p>
<p>they are suitable for generation of radiation of high directionality and of high mono-
</p>
<p>chromaticity; some of the lasers allow for generation of ultrashort pulses; some are
</p>
<p>suitable as giant pulse lasers.
</p>
<p>The Einstein coefficient B21 of transitions used in semiconductors is large and
</p>
<p>density of two-level atomic systems, which contribute to a laser oscillation, is large
</p>
<p>too. This has different reasons. A three-dimensional semiconductor can carry a large
</p>
<p>density of electrons contributing to the gain.ALow-dimensional semiconductor,with
</p>
<p>a large two-dimensional density of electrons contributing to gain, can be integrated
</p>
<p>in a integrated in a resonator of small size so that the so that the average density of
</p>
<p>two-level atomic systems in a photon mode has a large value too. In comparison with
</p>
<p>active media of semiconductor lasers, only one of the quantities of an active medium
</p>
<p>of other laser has a large value&mdash;either the Einstein coefficient B21 or the density of

<p>Chapter 21
</p>
<p>Basis of a Bipolar Semiconductor Laser
</p>
<p>We treat the basis of bipolar semiconductor lasers. We discuss: condition of gain;
</p>
<p>joint density of states; gain coefficient; laser equations; bipolar character of the active
</p>
<p>medium. And we derive, by use of Planck&rsquo;s radiation law, the Einstein coefficients
</p>
<p>for an ensemble of two-level systems that is governed by Fermi&rsquo;s statistics.
</p>
<p>The first part of this chapter is dealing with three-dimensional semiconductors.
</p>
<p>Another part, Sects. 21.8 and 21.9, concerns quantum well lasers. Instead of following
</p>
<p>through these two sections, a reader may solve the Problems 21.5 and 21.6, or jump
</p>
<p>to the next chapter that contains, in a short form, the main conclusions with respect
</p>
<p>to quantum well lasers.
</p>
<p>The active medium of a bipolar semiconductor laser is a semiconductor containing
</p>
<p>electrons in the conduction band and empty electron levels (holes) in the valence band.
</p>
<p>Permanent pumping (via a current delivered by a voltage source) leads to injection
</p>
<p>of electrons into the conduction band and to extraction of electrons from the valence
</p>
<p>band. The active medium carries no net charge. The density N of electrons in the
</p>
<p>conduction band is equal to the density of empty electron levels in the valence band.
</p>
<p>Laser radiation occurs due to stimulated transitions of electrons in the conduction
</p>
<p>band to empty levels in the valence band. The electrons in the conduction band have
</p>
<p>a Fermi distribution, f2, corresponding to a quasi-Fermi energy EFc. The electrons in
</p>
<p>the valence band have another Fermi distribution, f1, corresponding to a quasi-Fermi
</p>
<p>energy EFv.
</p>
<p>We derive the condition of gain: gain occurs if the occupation number difference
</p>
<p>is larger than zero, f2 &minus; f1 &gt; 0. This is equivalent to the condition that the density of
conduction band electrons is larger than the transparency density (N &gt; Ntr). And it is
</p>
<p>also equivalent to the condition that the difference of the quasi-Fermi energies is larger
</p>
<p>than the gap energy, EFc &minus; EFv &gt; Eg. Gain occurs for photons of a quantum energy
that is smaller than the difference of the quasi-Fermi energies, hν &lt; EFc &minus; EFv.
The range of gain increases with increasing density of nonequilibrium electrons in
</p>
<p>the conduction band (and a corresponding increasing density of empty levels in the
</p>
<p>valence band).

</p>
<p>We determine the reduced density of states (=joint density of states), taking
into account that energy and momentum conservation laws have to be obeyed in a
</p>
<p>radiative transition. We derive expressions describing stimulated and spontaneous
</p>
<p>emission. Furthermore, we formulate laser equations. Their solutions provide the
</p>
<p>threshold condition, particularly the threshold current. The solutions reveal clamping
</p>
<p>of occupation number difference f2 &minus; f1 and accordingly, clamping of the quasi-
Fermi energies.
</p>
<p>To combine, for calculation of gain, a quantum well that is a two-dimensional
</p>
<p>semiconductor with a radiation field that is three-dimensional, we use appropriate
</p>
<p>average densities. We introduced the method earlier (in Sects. 7.8 and 7.9 about gain
</p>
<p>mediated by a two-dimensional active medium). The topics we will treat with respect
</p>
<p>to the quantum well laser concern: condition of gain; quasi-Fermi energies; reduced
</p>
<p>mass; transparency density; gain characteristic; gain mediated by a quantum well
</p>
<p>oriented along the direction of a light beam; gain of radiation traversing a quantum
</p>
<p>well; laser equations and their solutions.

<p>21.1 Principle of a Bipolar Semiconductor Laser
</p>
<p>A bipolar semiconductor laser contains an electron gas in the conduction band and
</p>
<p>another electron gas in the valence band (Fig. 21.1a). The electron gas in the conduc-
</p>
<p>tion band is in a quasithermal equilibrium with the thermal bath. The quasithermal

<p>21.1 Principle of a Bipolar Semiconductor Laser 429
</p>
<p>equilibrium with the thermal bath, i.e., with the crystal lattice, is established via
</p>
<p>electron&ndash;phonon scattering. The electron gas in the valence band is also in a qua-
</p>
<p>sithermal equilibrium with the thermal bath. The quasithermal equilibrium with
</p>
<p>the thermal bath is also established via electron&ndash;phonon interaction. However, the
</p>
<p>two electron gases are far out of equilibrium with each other. Electron injection into
</p>
<p>the conduction band and electron extraction from the valence band maintain the
</p>
<p>nonequilibrium state.
</p>
<p>We will characterize the electron gas in the conduction band by the quasi-Fermi
</p>
<p>energy EFc and the electron gas in the valence band by the quasi-Fermi energy EFv
(Fig. 21.1b, left). The gain coefficient α of an active medium (Fig. 21.1b, right) is
</p>
<p>positive for radiation in the frequency range between νg, and νF , where νg = Eg/h
is the gap frequency, Eg the gap energy, and where νF corresponds to the difference
</p>
<p>of the quasi-Fermi energies according to the relation
</p>
<p>νF = (EFc &minus; EFv)/h. (21.1)
</p>
<p>This will be shown in the next sections.
</p>
<p>21.2 Condition of Gain of Radiation in a Bipolar
</p>
<p>Semiconductor
</p>
<p>We consider (Fig. 21.2) two discrete energy levels, a level 2 (energy E2) in the
</p>
<p>conduction band and a level 1 (energy E1) in the valence band. Radiative transitions
</p>
<p>between the two levels can occur by the three processes: absorption, stimulated
</p>
<p>and spontaneous emission. The transition rate of absorption (=number of transitions
per m3 and s) is equal to
</p>
<p>r12(ν) = r12(hν) = B̄12 f1(1 &minus; f2)ρ(hν). (21.2)

</p>
<p>We use the following quantities:
</p>
<p>&bull; Ec = energy of the bottom of the conduction band.
&bull; Ev = energy of the top of the valence band.
&bull; E2 = energy of the upper laser level.
&bull; E1 = energy of the lower laser level.
&bull; E21 = E2 &minus; E1 = transition energy.
&bull; B̄12 =Einstein coefficient of absorption (in units of m3 s&minus;1); B̄12 = hB12 (Sect. 6.6).
&bull; B̄21 = Einstein coefficient of stimulated emission.
&bull; A21 = Einstein coefficient of spontaneous emission.
&bull; f1 = f1(E1)= probability that level 1 is occupied; 1 &minus; f1 = probability that level
</p>
<p>1 is empty.
</p>
<p>&bull; f2 = f2(E2) = probability that level 2 is occupied.
&bull; (1 &minus; f2) = probability that level 2 is empty.
&bull; ρ(hν) = spectral energy density of the radiation on the energy scale.
</p>
<p>It is convenient to choose the energy scale. Consequently, the Einstein coefficients
</p>
<p>of absorption and stimulated emission, B̄12 and B̄21, differ from B12 and B21.
</p>
<p>The rate of stimulated emission processes is equal to
</p>
<p>r21(hν) = B̄21 f2(1 &minus; f1)ρ(hν). (21.3)
</p>
<p>The spontaneous emission rate is equal to
</p>
<p>r21,sp(hν) = A21 f2(1 &minus; f1). (21.4)
</p>
<p>The occupation probability of level 2 is given by the Fermi&ndash;Dirac distribution
</p>
<p>f2 =
1
</p>
<p>exp [(E &minus; EFc)/kT ] + 1
. (21.5)
</p>
<p>EFc is the quasi-Fermi energy of the electrons in the conduction band and T is the
</p>
<p>lattice temperature. The occupation probability of level 1 is
</p>
<p>f1 =
1
</p>
<p>exp [(E &minus; EFv)/kT ] + 1
. (21.6)
</p>
<p>EFv is the quasi-Fermi energy of the electrons in the valence band.
</p>
<p>At thermal equilibrium, the transition rates of upward and downward transitions
</p>
<p>are equal,
</p>
<p>r12 = r21 + r21,sp, (21.7)
</p>
<p>and the Fermi energies coincide,
</p>
<p>EFc = EFv = EF. (21.8)</p>

<p>21.2 Condition of Gain of Radiation in a Bipolar Semiconductor 431
</p>
<p>It follows that
</p>
<p>ρ(hν) =
A21 f2(1 &minus; f1)
</p>
<p>B̄12 f1(1 &minus; f2)&minus; B̄21 f2(1 &minus; f1)
(21.9)
</p>
<p>must be equal to the expression given by Planck&rsquo;s radiation law (now with the energy

<p>ρ(hν) =

<p>c3
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>ehν/kT &minus; 1

</p>
<p>The comparison yields
</p>
<p>A21 = 8πn3ν3c&minus;3 B̄21 (21.11)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>B̄12 = B̄21. (21.12)
</p>
<p>We find again the Einstein relations. If a semiconductor is optically anisotropic, the
</p>
<p>value of B̄12 (=B̄21) depends on the direction of the electromagnetic field relative to
the orientation of the semiconductor. Then a modification of the Einstein relations
</p>
<p>is necessary.
</p>
<p>At nonequilibrium, the quasi-Fermi energies are different, EFc �= EFv, i.e., the
electrons in the conduction band are not in an equilibrium with respect to the electrons
</p>
<p>in the valence band. However, the electrons within the conduction band form an
</p>
<p>electron gas that is in a quasiequilibrium with the lattice at the temperature T&mdash;
</p>
<p>and the electrons within the valence band form another electron gas that is in a
</p>
<p>quasiequilibrium with the lattice at the temperature T . In a bibpolar semiconductor
</p>
<p>laser nonequilibrium state consists of two electron gases that are far out of equilibrium
</p>
<p>relative to each other.
</p>
<p>The net rate of stimulated emission and absorption by transitions between the two
</p>
<p>energy levels of energy E1 and E2 is equal to
</p>
<p>r21 &minus; r12 = B̄21( f2 &minus; f1)ρ(hν). (21.13)
</p>
<p>Stimulated emission prevails if the occupation number difference is larger than zero,
</p>
<p>f2 &minus; f1 &gt; 0. (21.14)
</p>
<p>This condition corresponds to
</p>
<p>EFc &minus; EFv &gt; Eg. (21.15)
</p>
<p>A bipolar medium is an active medium if the difference of the quasi-Fermi energies

<p>is larger than the gap energy. The injection of electrons leads to a density N of

valence band). Because of neutrality, the two densities are equal, N = P .
</p>
<p>The quasi-Fermi energy of the electrons in the conduction band follows from the
</p>
<p>condition that the density of occupied levels in the conduction band is equal to the
</p>
<p>density N of nonequilibrium electrons in the conduction band,

</p>

f2(E)Dc(E)dE = N . (21.16)
</p>
<p>The quantities are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Dc(E) = density of states in the conduction band (in units of m&minus;3 J&minus;1).
&bull; f2(E)Dc(E)dE = density of occupied levels in the conduction band in the energy
</p>
<p>interval E, E + dE .
&bull; N = density of electrons = density of electrons injected into the conduction band
</p>
<p>(in units of m&minus;3).
</p>
<p>The density of unoccupied electron levels in the valence band is
</p>
<p>&int; &infin;
</p>
<p>&minus;&infin;
(1 &minus; f1)Dv(E)dE = P (=N ), (21.17)
</p>
<p>where the quantities are:

<p>&bull; Dv(E) = density of states in the valence band.
&bull; f1(E)Dv(E)dE = density of occupied levels in the valence band within the energy

</p>
<p>We can use the last two equations to determine, for a given electron density N , the
</p>
<p>quasi-Fermi energies EFc and EFv.
</p>
<p>The description of the electronic states takes into account that the electrons in the
</p>
<p>conduction band obey the Pauli principle. Each of the states can be occupied with
</p>
<p>two electrons (of opposite spin). A Fermi distribution function describes the filling
</p>
<p>of the conduction band. With increasing electron density N , the quasi-Fermi energy
</p>
<p>EFc increases. Correspondingly, the extraction of electrons from the valence band
</p>
<p>leads, with increasing density N of empty levels, to a decrease of the quasi-Fermi
</p>
<p>energy EFv. The difference of the quasi-Fermi energies, EFc &minus; EFv, increases with
increasing N . The difference becomes equal to the gap energy,
</p>
<p>EFc &minus; EFv = Eg if N = Ntr. (21.18)

<p>Ntr is the transparency density. At this electron density, the Fermi functions have,

stimulated emission and absorption are equal. Accordingly, the semiconductor is</p>

<p>21.2 Condition of Gain of Radiation in a Bipolar Semiconductor 433
</p>
<p>transparent for radiation of the photon energy hν = E2 &minus; E1 = Eg. Gain occurs if
the electron density exceeds the transparency density. The range of gain increases
</p>
<p>with increasing N &minus; Ntr. We can express the result in other words: the range of
gain increases with increasing filling of the conduction band with electrons and the
</p>
<p>simultaneous extraction of electrons from the valence band (i.e., with the filling of
</p>

<p>21.3 Energy Level Broadening
</p>
<p>We study transitions involving monochromatic radiation in the energy interval hν,
</p>
<p>hν + d(hν) taking into account energy level broadening (Fig. 21.3). The net transition
rate is equal to
</p>
<p>(r21 &minus; r12)hv d(hν) = B̄21g(hν &minus; E21) ( f2 &minus; f1) ρ(hν)d(hν), (21.19)

<p>where g(hν &minus; E21) is the lineshape function that corresponds to the 1&rarr; 2 absorption
line. The lineshape function is normalized,
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>g(hν &minus; E21) d(hν) = 1; (21.20)
</p>
<p>the integral over all contributions g(hν &minus; E21)d(hν) is unity. If the lineshape function
is a Lorentzian, we can write
</p>
<p>g(hν &minus; E21) =
δE21
</p>
<p>2π
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>(hν &minus; E21)2 + δE221/4
. (21.21)
</p>
<p>δE21 is the linewidth of the transition.
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.3 Energy level broadening</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>434 21 Basis of a Bipolar Semiconductor Laser
</p>
<p>If the radiation is monochromatic, d(hν) ≪ δE21, then the net transition rate of
transitions between level 2 and level 1 is given by
</p>
<p>r21 &minus; r12 =
&int;
</p>
<p>(r21 &minus; r12)hνd(hν) =
&int;
</p>
<p>B̄21g(hν &minus; E21)( f2 &minus; f1)ρ(hν)d(hν).
(21.22)
</p>
<p>With u =
&int;
</p>
<p>ρ(hν)d(hν) and the energy density u = Zhν, we can write
</p>
<p>r21 &minus; r12 = hν B̄21g(hν &minus; E21) [ f2(E2)&minus; f1(E1)] Z . (21.23)
</p>
<p>The transition rate is proportional to the occupation number difference f2 &minus; f1 and to
the photon density Z . The condition of gain remains the same, f2(E2)&minus; f1(E1) &gt; 0,
as derived without taking account of energy level broadening. At the transparency
</p>
<p>density, where f2(E2)&minus; f1(E1) = 0, there is no contribution to gain of radiation of
the quantum energy hν by 2 &rarr; 1 transitions&mdash;whether hν lies in the line center or
in the wing of the line. We thus have obtained the condition of gain:
</p>
<p>f2(E2)&minus; f1(E1) &gt; 0 (21.24)
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>EFc &minus; EFv &gt; Eg, (21.25)
</p>
<p>which corresponds to
</p>
<p>hν &lt; EFc &minus; EFv. (21.26)
</p>
<p>The photon energy can have a value that is smaller than the gap energy Eg because of
</p>
<p>the energy level broadening. An electron level (in the conduction band as well in the
</p>
<p>valence band) has a finite lifetime due to inelastic scattering of electrons at phonons
</p>
<p>(electron&ndash;phonon scattering).
</p>
<p>The condition of gain, hν &lt; EFc &minus; EFv, is sometimes called Bernard&ndash;Duraffourg
relation according to the authors of a corresponding publication [201].

<p>21.4 Reduced Density of States
</p>
<p>Because of momentum conservation, a radiative transition from a particular level
</p>
<p>2 can only occur to a particular level 1. Vice versa, a radiative transition from the
</p>
<p>lower level 1 can only occur to the corresponding upper level 2. The momentum
</p>
<p>�k2 of a conduction band electron involved in an emission process must be equal to
</p>
<p>the momentum �k1 of the electron in the valence band (after the transition) plus the
</p>
<p>momentum �qp of the photon created, or
</p>
<p>k2 = k1 + qp. (21.27)</p>

<p>We assume, for simplicity, that

</p>
<p>It follows that

<p>A radiative transition corresponds in the energy-wave vector diagram (see Fig. 21.2)

(E21 &minus; Eg). (21.38)
</p>
<p>How many radiative pair levels are available in the energy interval E21, E21 +
dE21? The number of states, Dr(E21)dE21, is equal to the corresponding number of
</p>
<p>levels in the conduction band,
</p>
<p>Dr(E21)dE21 = Dc(ǫc)dǫc. (21.39)
</p>
<p>Thus, the reduced density of states (=joint density of states = density of states of

<p>Dr(E21) =
Dc(ǫc)

<p>dE21/dǫc

<p>mr
</p>

Dc(ǫc). (21.40)
</p>
<p>Dc is the density of states in the conduction band. Correspondingly, we can write

<p>Dr(E21) =
mr
</p>
<p>mh
Dv(ǫh). (21.41)
</p>
<p>Dv is the density of states in the valence band. The reduced density of states is smaller

<p>than the density of states in the conduction band and also smaller than the density of
</p>
<p>states in the valence band. The reason is the spreading of the energy scale:
</p>
<p>dE21 = dǫc + dǫv. (21.42)
</p>
<p>As a result, we find that radiative transitions occur within radiative pairs of electron

The empty levels in the valence band are distributed over a larger range too and the

<p>of phonons. At finite temperature, emission and absorption of phonons leads to the
</p>
<p>establishment of the quasi-Fermi distribution of the electrons in the conduction band.
</p>
<p>After the establishment of a quasithermal equilibrium, the conduction band electrons
</p>
<p>still scatter permanently at phonons. Accordingly, each electron level is broadened.
</p>
<p>The width of a broadened energy level in the conduction band isΔE2 &asymp; �/τin, where
τin is the inelastic scattering time of an electron, i.e., the time between two inelastic
</p>
<p>scattering events. The scattering time τin depends on temperature.
</p>
<p>The main process of electron&ndash;phonon scattering is the interaction with polar optic
</p>
<p>phonons; the energy of polar optic phonons of GaAs is about 40 meV. The inelastic
</p>
<p>scattering time (&sim;10&minus;13 s) of a conduction electron in GaAs at room temperature
is much shorter than the lifetime (of the order of 1 ns) with respect to a radiative
</p>
<p>transition to the valence band by spontaneous emission of a photon. The width of
</p>
<p>broadening of a level in the conduction band is �/τin &sim; 6 meV.
The extraction of valence band electrons from the active region leads to the estab-
</p>
<p>lishment of a quasi-Fermi distribution of the valence band electrons. Due to the non-
</p>
<p>radiative relaxation, the valence band, nearly filled with electrons, has empty states
</p>
<p>(holes) near the maximum of the band, as characterized by the quasi-Fermi energy
</p>
<p>EFv. The electrons in the valence band scatter also at phonons and the strength of the
</p>
<p>scattering is about the same as for the electrons in the conduction band. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>an electron level in the valence band has approximately the same lifetime with respect
</p>
<p>to inelastic scattering at phonons as an electron state in the conduction band&mdash;and
</p>
<p>the width of an energy level in the valence band is ΔE1 &asymp; �/τin too.
Taking into account broadening of both the energy level in the conduction band
</p>
<p>and energy level in the valence band, which are involved in a radiative transition,
</p>
<p>we attribute to the transition a Lorentzian function g(hν &minus; E21) of a width that is
by a factor of
</p>
<p>&radic;
2 larger than the value of the width of a level in a single band. The
</p>

<p>21.6 Spontaneous Emission
</p>
<p>Spontaneous emission of radiation is the origin of luminescence radiation. The rate of
</p>
<p>spontaneous emission of photons by transitions in the energy range hν, hν + hdν is
</p>
<p>Rsp,hνhdν =
&int;
</p>
<p>g(hν &minus; E21)hdν &times; A21Dr(E21) f2(1 &minus; f1)dE21. (21.57)
</p>
<p>Rsp,hν is the spontaneous emission rate per unit of photon energy (and per unit of
</p>
<p>volume). The integration takes account of the contributions of all electrons in the
</p>
<p>conduction band and of the corresponding empty levels in the valence band. It follows
</p>
<p>that
</p>
<p>Rsp,hν =

<p>A21Dr(E21) f2(1 &minus; f1)g(hν &minus; E21)dE21. (21.58)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>440 21 Basis of a Bipolar Semiconductor Laser
</p>
<p>Spontaneous emission can also occur at photon energies hν &lt; Eg. This is the conse-
</p>
<p>quence of the broadening of the energy levels due to the finite lifetimes of the con-
</p>
<p>duction band and valence band states with respect to inelastic scattering at phonons.
</p>
<p>The total spontaneous emission rate is

</p>
<p>emission is

<p>τsp =

<p>Rsp/N

</p>
<p>N is the density of electrons in the conduction band. If g(hν &minus; E21) is a narrow
function, we obtain

<p>Rsp,hν = A21Dr(E21) f2(1 &minus; f1). (21.61)

</p>
<p>are f2 = 1 in the region of populated energy levels and f1 = 0 in the region of empty

</p>
<p>At finite temperatures, transitions from an occupied electron level in the conduc-
</p>
<p>tion band to an occupied electron level in the valence band cannot occur. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the decay constant is smaller than the Einstein coefficient of spontaneous emission,

</p>
<p>In a bipolar semiconductor laser diode (Fig. 21.6a), the current I is flowing via
</p>
<p>the large area (a1L) through the active volume (height a2). Below threshold, the
</p>
<p>electron concentration N increases (Fig. 21.6b) with increasing current strength until
</p>
<p>the current reaches the threshold current
</p>

</p>
<p>At stronger pumping, the carrier density remains at the value Nth. This means clamp-
</p>
<p>ing of the following quantities: populations in the conduction and valence band;
</p>
<p>quasi-Fermi energy of the electrons in the conduction band; quasi-Fermi energy of
</p>
<p>the electrons in the valence band. Pumping above threshold leads to conversion of
</p>
<p>the additional pump power into photons and energy of relaxation. Above threshold,
</p>
<p>the rate of photon generation is equal to the additional rate of electron injection. The
</p>
<p>photon density in the laser resonator increases linearly with I &minus; Ith.
The luminescence spectrum (Fig. 21.6c) is broad while the spectrum of the laser
</p>
<p>radiation is narrow.
</p>
<p>At weak pumping (below threshold), luminescence radiation becomes stronger
</p>
<p>with increasing pump strength. Above threshold, clamping of luminescence occurs
</p>
<p>together with the clamping of the quasi-Fermi energies.

<p>21.8 Gain Mediated by a Quantum Well
</p>
<p>In two earlier sections (Sects. 7.8 and 7.9), we treated the question how we can com-
</p>
<p>bine a two-dimensional active medium with a light beam, which is three-dimensional.
</p>
<p>We introduced the two-dimensional gain characteristic H 2D and showed how we
</p>
<p>can determine the modal gain coefficient of radiation propagating along a two-
</p>
<p>dimensional gain medium and how we can determine the gain, G1 &minus; 1, of radiation
crossing a quantum well. The topic of this section concerns the following questions.
</p>
<p>&bull; How can we determine semiconductor properties of an active quantum well (quasi-
Fermi energies; strength of spontaneous emission of radiation; two-dimensional
</p>
<p>transparency density; two-dimensional gain characteristic)?
</p>
<p>&bull; How can we determine gain of radiation interacting with an active quantum well
(according to the concepts presented in Sects. 7.8 and 7.9)?
</p>
<p>Instead of proceeding with this section, a reader may jump to Sect. 21.10 and
</p>
<p>then work out Problem 21.5 (gain mediated by a quantum well) and Problem 21.6
</p>
<p>(quantum well laser).

<p>21.10 What Is Meant by &ldquo;Bipolar&rdquo;?
</p>
<p>Instead of discussing empty electron states in the valence band of a bipolar laser
</p>
<p>medium, we can use the picture of holes: an empty level in the valence band is a hole
</p>
<p>in the valence band. Accordingly, a current leads to injection of electrons into the
</p>
<p>conduction band and to injection of holes into the valence band. In the electron&ndash;hole
</p>
<p>picture, the current is carried by electrons in the conduction band and by holes in the
</p>
<p>valence band&mdash;the current is carried by negatively charged quasiparticles (electrons)
</p>
<p>and positively charged quasiparticles (holes); the discussion that now follows can be
</p>
<p>in [236].
</p>
<p>Involved in a radiative transition (Fig. 21.9) are an electron (in the conduction
</p>
<p>band) and a hole (in the valence band). In an absorption process, an electron and a
</p>
<p>hole annihilate recombine and create a photon. Conservation of momentum requires
</p>
<p>that the momentum before an emission process is equal to the momentum after the
</p>
<p>process,
</p>
<p>�ke + �kh = �qp, (21.129)
</p>
<p>where ke is the wave vector of the electron, kh the wave vector of the hole, and qp
the wave vector of the photon. If qp ≪ ke, kh, then</p>

</p>
<p>kh = &minus;ke. (21.130)
</p>
<p>In the electron&ndash;hole picture, the wave vector conservation ke + kh = 0 corresponds
to the wave vector conservation kce = kve in the electron picture. The momentum of
an empty electron state of the valence band is &minus;�kve while �kve is the momentum
of an electron that occupies this state. Accordingly, the wave vector kh of a hole (in
</p>
<p>the valence band) is
</p>
<p>kh = &minus;kve. (21.131)
</p>
<p>Electron and hole have opposite wave vectors. A radiative pair&mdash;an electron&ndash;hole
</p>
<p>pair consisting of an electron and a hole of opposite wave vector&mdash;can annihilate
</p>
<p>(=recombine) by spontaneous or stimulated emission of a photon. Laser radiation
in a bipolar laser is due to stimulated electron&ndash;hole recombination. The energy of a

<p>The occupation number of a hole state is
</p>
<p>fh = 1 &minus; f1. (21.133)
</p>
<p>It follows that the quasi-Fermi energy EFh of the holes is equal to the quasi-Fermi

<p>Because of bipolarity and charge neutrality of an active medium, the knowledge

</p>
<p>characterization of a particular active medium (if the density of states of electrons
</p>
<p>and holes as well as the temperature are known).
</p>
<p>The bipolarity of a medium manifests itself in the dependence of the spontaneous
</p>
<p>lifetime on the densities of positive and negative charge carriers. It turns out (analyz-
</p>
<p>ing Rsp) that the rate τ
&minus;1
sp of spontaneous transitions of electrons in a semiconductor
</p>
<p>at room temperature is, for very small values of N , approximately proportional to
</p>
<p>the product of the density N of electrons and the density P = N of holes,
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>τsp
= K N 2. (21.137)
</p>
<p>K is a constant. At large values of N , the decay rate τ&minus;1sp is nearly independent of N .
</p>
<p>The behavior is characteristic of a bipolar system.

</p>
<p>GaAs Quantum Well Laser
</p>
<p>As an example of a bipolar semiconductor laser, we treat the GaAs quantum well
</p>
<p>laser (wavelength around 800 nm). In later chapters, we will study quantum well
</p>
<p>lasers consisting of other materials and bipolar lasers of other types.
</p>
<p>We describe a quantum well by an electron subband and a hole subband (the heavy
</p>
<p>hole subband); we will, in a later chapter (Chap. 26), slightly modify the description
</p>
<p>of a quantum well laser by taking into account another hole subband (the light hole
</p>
<p>subband).
</p>
<p>To characterize an active quantum well, we calculate the quasi-Fermi energies
</p>
<p>of electrons and holes; because the densities of states of electrons and holes have
</p>
<p>constant (energy-independent) values, we obtain analytic expressions of the quasi-
</p>
<p>Fermi energies. We consider a GaAs quantum well (at low temperature and at room
</p>
<p>temperature) carrying nonequilibrium electrons of different densities N 2D. We deter-
</p>
<p>mine the quasi-Fermi energy, the occupation number difference f2 &minus; f1 and the two-
</p>
<p>dimensional gain characteristic H 2D. We discuss modal growth and gain coefficients.
</p>
<p>We introduce the material gain coefficient; the material gain coefficient corresponds
</p>
<p>to a three-dimensional description of the quantum film, but with a two-dimensional
</p>
<p>density of states.
</p>
<p>The quantum well laser consists of a heterostructure composed of at least five
</p>
<p>semiconductor layers. These have the tasks: to form a quantum well; to provide a
</p>
<p>light guide effect; to allow for injection of electrons and holes into the quantum well
</p>
<p>by means of a current. We describe the principle and the design of the edge emitting
</p>
<p>GaAs quantum well laser. We derive the laser threshold condition and determine the
</p>
<p>threshold current. The solutions to the rate equations of a quantum well laser indicate
</p>
<p>clamping of the quasi-Fermi energies of the electron and hole gases.
</p>
<p>A multi-quantum well laser, containing several quantum wells in parallel, has
</p>
<p>a larger gain and a larger output power than a quantum well laser containing one
</p>
<p>quantum well only.
</p>
<p>The arrangement of many laser diodes in a linear array or in a stack of arrays results
</p>
<p>in a high-power semiconductor laser. The radiation of a high-power semiconductor

<p>high degree of monochromaticity.
</p>
<p>Besides the edge emitting quantum well laser, we discuss the vertical-cavity
</p>
<p>surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). The importance with respect to applications&mdash;of
</p>
<p>both edge emitting quantum well laser and vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser&mdash;
</p>
<p>has already been discussed (in Sect. 1.4).
</p>
<p>We finally point out that the laser radiation of an edge-emitting laser can be
</p>
<p>polarized, with the electric field vector of the laser radiation lies in the plane of the
</p>
<p>quantum well. As a last point, we determine the spectrum of luminescence radiation
</p>
<p>emitted by a quantum well laser in addition to laser radiation.
</p>
<p>22.1 GaAs Quantum Well
</p>
<p>A GaAs quantum well (Fig. 22.1) consists of a thin GaAs film embedded in
</p>
<p>GaAlAs. Electrons can assume lower energies in the GaAs layer than in GaAlAs and
</p>
<p>holes can assume higher energies. Because of the lateral restriction, free-electron
</p>
<p>motion is only possible along the film plane. The two-dimensional free-electron
</p>
<p>motion of a conduction band electron is characterized by the electron subband.
</p>
<p>Correspondingly, the two-dimensional free-electron motion of a valence band elec-
</p>
<p>tron is characterized by a hole subband. The gap energy E2Dg of the two-dimensional
</p>
<p>semiconductor is slightly larger than the gap energy Eg of the corresponding bulk
</p>
<p>semiconductor because of the zero point energy associated with the electron and the

</p>
<p>The GaAs quantum well laser (Fig. 22.8) consists of a heterostructure with two
</p>
<p>different n-doped GaAlAs layers, the GaAs quantum layer, and two different p-doped
</p>
<p>GaAlAs layers. Under the influence of a voltage, electrons from the n-doped region
</p>
<p>and holes from the p-doped region drift into the quantum film. Stimulated transitions
</p>
<p>from occupied levels in the conduction band to empty levels in the valence band
</p>
<p>give rise to generation of laser radiation. The quantum film has no net charge, the
</p>
<p>two-dimensional densities of nonequilibrium electrons and nonequilibrium holes
</p>
<p>are equal. The quantum well laser contains at least five different semiconductor
</p>
<p>layers. An n-doped GaAs substrate (n+ GaAs substrate) supports the layers. The
</p>
<p>layer sequence can be, for instance, the following (beginning with the substrate).

</p>
<p>&bull; n Ga0.75Al 0.25As.

</p>
<p>are doped with silicon atoms and contain free-electrons of a concentration of (1&ndash;2)
</p>

</p>
<p>within the conduction band of GaAs. The concentration of excess electrons is smaller
</p>
<p>(by about two orders of magnitude) in the n GaAlAs layers. The Fermi level of the
</p>
<p>valence band electrons in the p-doped GaAs layers lies within the valence band.
</p>
<p>The photon mode of a laser diode (Fig. 22.9) has submillimeter size (e.g., 100&micro;m
</p>
<p>&times; 0.2&micro;m &times; 500&micro;m). Metal films on top of the heterostructure and on the backside
</p>
<p>of the substrate serve as electrical contacts. Under the action of a voltage (U ), a
</p>
<p>current (I ) is flowing through the heterostructure. Electrons in the n-doped region
</p>
<p>and holes in the p-doped region carry the current. Electrons and holes recombine
</p>
<p>within the quantum well. Stimulated electron-hole pair recombination drives the

</p>
<p>The refractive is n(Ga1&minus;x Alx As) &asymp; 3.60 &minus; 0.71x . Across the heterostructure, the
</p>
<p>refractive index has the largest value in the very thin GaAs quantum layer. The
</p>
<p>refractive index is larger in the Ga0.75Al0.25As layers than in the Ga0.9Al0.1As layers.
</p>
<p>This leads to a light guide effect. The light is concentrated in the Ga0.9Al0.1As layers,
</p>
<p>which together have an optical thickness between one and two wavelengths. The
</p>
<p>GaAs film has a thickness (of the order of 10 nm) that is much smaller than the
</p>
<p>thickness of the adjacent Ga0.9Al0.1As layers. Accordingly, only a small portion of
</p>
<p>the field overlaps with the quantum well.
</p>
<p>The current through a quantum well corresponds to a migration of electrons from
</p>
<p>the n+ substrate to the quantum well and, at the same time, to the migration of holes
</p>
<p>from the p-doped layers to the quantum well. The injection of electrons into the
</p>
<p>quantum well (see Fig. 22.8) leads to a nonequilibrium population of electrons in
</p>
<p>the electron subband, characterized by the quasi-Fermi energy EFe. The injection of
</p>
<p>holes into the quantum well leads to a nonequilibrium population of holes in the hole
</p>
<p>subband, characterized by the quasi-Fermi energy EFv. Under the action of a voltage
</p>
<p>U across the heterostructure, an electron migrating through the heterostructure loses
</p>
<p>its potential energy eU mainly due to the processes: relaxation within the electron
</p>
<p>subband; transition to the hole subband by stimulated emission of a photon; and
</p>
<p>energy necessary for extraction of the electron from the hole subband. The extrac-
</p>
<p>tion of an electron from the hole subband corresponds to injection of a hole from
</p>
<p>the p-doped region into the hole subband accompanied with relaxation of the hole.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, we find the quantum efficiency

<p>22.5 Multi-Quantum Well Laser
</p>
<p>A laser diode can contain (Fig. 22.10) more than one quantum well (e.g., five to
</p>
<p>ten quantum wells), arranged in parallel. This leads to a larger output power and a
</p>
<p>smaller threshold current. The radiation of a multi-quantum well laser is coherent.
</p>
<p>22.6 High-Power Semiconductor Laser
</p>
<p>A high-power semiconductor laser consists of laser diodes arranged in an array or as
</p>
<p>a bar of laser arrays (Fig. 22.11). A laser array contains 10&ndash;100 laser diodes. The laser
</p>
<p>diodes are kept at room temperature by the use of a cooler, which itself is cooled with
</p>
<p>air or via the mechanical support. Each single laser diode emits coherent radiation.
</p>
<p>However, the oscillations of different laser diodes are not in phase. Therefore, a
</p>
<p>high-power semiconductor laser generates a beam of incoherent monochromatic
</p>
<p>radiation. Depending on the number of arrays, a high-power semiconductor laser
</p>
<p>produces radiation with a power in the watt to kW range.
</p>
<p>A diode array of laser diodes, each with a microlens collimating the radiation,
</p>
<p>emits radiation that has a divergence of &sim;10◦ in the plane of the array and 1◦ per-
</p>
<p>pendicular to the plane; without lenses, the divergence is 10◦ in the plane and 40◦
</p>
<p>perpendicular to the plane.</p>

does not lead to noticeably larger values of f2 &minus; f1 (Problem 22.4).
</p>
<p>In comparison with the edge emitting laser, the vertical-cavity surface-emitting
</p>
<p>laser requires, as shown, a resonator with a high Q factor. The vertical-cavity surface-
</p>
<p>emitting laser has advantages:
</p>
<p>&bull; The radiation is less divergent.
</p>
<p>&bull; The size can be much smaller.
</p>
<p>&bull; The threshold current can be much smaller.
</p>
<p>The lower threshold current results in a smaller heating effect.

<p>22.8 Polarization of Radiation of a Quantum Well Laser
</p>
<p>A quantum film is optically anisotropic. More detailed studies show that the Einstein
</p>
<p>coefficient B&perp;21, i.e., with the electric field being perpendicular to the film plane, is
</p>
<p>zero and therefore B
||
</p>
<p>21 = 1.5B21. Accordingly, the radiation of an edge emitting
</p>
<p>bipolar laser&mdash;that generates radiation due to recombination of electrons and heavy
</p>
<p>holes&mdash;is polarized and the direction of the electric field of the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>wave is parallel to the plane of the quantum well. However, emission of radiation of
</p>
<p>well-defined polarization direction is limited to a narrow frequency range near the
</p>
<p>two-dimensional gap frequency. Toward higher frequency, light holes (Sect. 26.3)
</p>
<p>can give rise to generation of radiation of a less defined polarization direction.
</p>
<p>It is a further consequence of the anisotropy that the Einstein relations have to be
</p>
<p>modified: A21 is related to an average value between B
||
</p>
<p>21 and B
&perp;
21.

</p>
<p>of the periodic table or compounds of elements of the second and the sixth group.
</p>
<p>The compounds have energy gaps corresponding to gap frequencies ranging from
</p>
<p>the infrared to the near UV.
</p>
<p>We describe the zinc blende crystal structure that is common to many of the
</p>
<p>semiconductor laser materials and introduce the monolayer as an important structural
</p>
<p>element of heterostructures. Heterostructures are suitable for the design of artificial
</p>
<p>materials with spatially varying energy bands.
</p>
<p>We shortly mention the methods of preparation of semiconductor heterostructures.
</p>
<p>After a survey of the different materials, we will concentrate the discussion on
</p>
<p>heterostructures composed of GaAs and AlAs.
</p>
<p>We will present dispersion curves of electrons in GaAs and AlAs. And we will
</p>
<p>discuss absorption coefficients of GaAs and AlAs, characterizing absorption due to

<p>Group III&ndash;V semiconductors&mdash;materials composed of group III and group V ele-

</p>
<p>Figure 23.1 shows a section of the periodic table. The III&ndash;V semiconductors are
</p>
<p>the materials of laser diodes from the UV to the infrared. The III&ndash;V semiconductors
</p>
<p>consisting of atoms of small masses have large bandgaps and III&ndash;V semiconductors
</p>
<p>consisting of atoms of large masses have small bandgaps. AlN has a large bandgap
</p>
<p>and InSb a small one. The group IV semiconductors diamond, silicon, germanium
</p>
<p>and gray tin are indirect semiconductors. These are not suitable as active materials
</p>
<p>of bipolar semiconductor lasers. Group III&ndash;V semiconductors are known since 1952

<p>23.2 GaAlAs Mixed Crystal
</p>
<p>It is possible to prepare Ga1&minus;x Alx As mixed crystals of each mixing ratio x . In
</p>
<p>a GaAlAs crystal, Al atoms replace Ga atoms. The energy gap of Ga1&minus;x Alx As
</p>
<p>(Fig. 23.2a) varies continuously with the mixing ratio, from the energy gap of GaAs
</p>
<p>(x = 0) up to the k = 0 gap of AlAs (x = 1); Ga1&minus;x Alx As is a direct gap semiconduc-
</p>
<p>tor for x &lt; 0.32 and an indirect gap semiconductor for larger x . For the region of the
</p>
<p>direct gap, the energy gap (in units of eV) of a mixed GaAlAs crystal (at room tem-
</p>
<p>perature) follows from the relation Eg (Ga1&minus;x Alx As) = 1.424 + 1.247 x &minus; 0.14 x
2.
</p>
<p>A GaAs crystal and an AlAs crystal have a special property in common: they
</p>
<p>have nearly the same lattice constant. The cubic lattice constants (of crystals at room
</p>
<p>temperature) are:
</p>
<p>&bull; GaAs d = 0.565326(2)nm.
</p>
<p>&bull; AlAs d = 0.5660 nm.
</p>
<p>The difference between the lattice constants of GaAs and AlAs is only about a tenth
</p>
<p>of a percent and smaller for the Ga1&minus;x Alx As (x = 0 . . . 1) mixed crystals. Therefore,
</p>
<p>GaAs is an ideal substrate for deposition of Ga1&minus;x Alx As layers, independently of
</p>
<p>the value of x . The lattice constant d increases, from the value of GaAs to the value
</p>
<p>of AlAs, linearly with x (Fig. 23.2b).</p>

</p>
<p>δEg of the gap energy across the GaAlAs/GaAs interface is partly due to the con-
</p>
<p>duction band offset and partly due to the valence band offset. Both vary linearly
</p>
<p>with the composition x . The mixed crystal is, as already mentioned, a direct gap
</p>
<p>semiconductor for x &lt; 0.32 and an indirect gap semiconductor for larger x . The
</p>
<p>conduction band offset (Fig. 23.4b) is δc(x) = 0.67δEg(x) and the valence band off-
</p>
<p>set is δv(x) = 0.33δEg(x).
</p>
<p>23.5 Preparation of Heterostructures
</p>
<p>There are two basic techniques of preparation of heterostructures, the molecular
</p>
<p>beam epitaxy (MBE) and the metal oxide chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD),
</p>
<p>which is a special method of chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
</p>
<p>Molecular beam epitaxy is performed in a chamber with ultrahigh vacuum (pres-
</p>
<p>sure &lt;10&minus;10 mbar). To grow a heterostructure containing GaAs and GaAlAs, the
</p>
<p>elements Ga and Al are evaporated from effusion cells. The chamber contains As
</p>
<p>at a very low pressure. The GaAs substrate has a temperature that is favorable for</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>480 23 Semiconductor Materials and Heterostructures
</p>
<p>epitactic growth&mdash;for the growth of atomic layers with the same lattice constant as
</p>
<p>the substrate. Silicon (for n-doping) or phosphorus (for p-doping) are evaporated
</p>
<p>from appropriate effusion cells. The molecular beam epitaxy is suitable for grow-
</p>
<p>ing heterostructures of atomic accuracy, in particular for preparation of GaAs and
</p>
<p>InP-based heterostructures for infrared bipolar lasers and quantum cascade lasers.
</p>
<p>In the chemical vapor deposition process, a gas mixture of organic metal oxides
</p>
<p>containing the constituents (e.g., Ga and N) flows over a substrate. Near the sub-
</p>
<p>strate surface, the organic metal oxides decompose and the new material (GaN)
</p>
<p>grows on the substrate. The chemical vapor deposition is used to prepare GaN-
</p>
<p>based heterostructures. Doping materials of GaN-based semiconductors are silicon
</p>
<p>(n-doping) or magnesium (p-doping). In comparison with the molecular beam epi-
</p>
<p>taxy, the chemical vapor deposition needs less technical effort and allows for a higher
</p>
<p>speed of production of heterostructures.
</p>
<p>23.6 Preparation of Laser Diodes
</p>
<p>To prepare laser diodes, a wafer covered with a heterostructure is laterally structured.
</p>
<p>Different steps of structuring include photolithography, chemical etching or plasma
</p>
<p>etching, and the preparation of ohmic contacts.
</p>
<p>23.7 Material Limitations
</p>
<p>Bipolar semiconductor lasers are realizable in a wide frequency range. There are
</p>
<p>limitations at large frequencies and at small frequencies.
</p>
<p>The direct gap semiconductor with the widest gap (used to prepare semiconductor
</p>
<p>lasers) is AlN. The gap energy (6.2 eV) corresponds to a gap frequency of 1.5 &times;
</p>
<p>1015 Hz (wavelength 200 nm).
</p>
<p>At small frequencies, bipolar lasers operated at room temperature are limited to
</p>
<p>frequencies of about 1.3 &times; 1014 Hz (vacuum wavelength 2&micro;m), corresponding to
</p>
<p>an energy gap of 0.6 eV. At smaller frequencies (smaller gap energies) nonradiative
</p>
<p>transitions between conduction band and valence band become strong and population
</p>
<p>inversion is not possible. By cooling, the nonradiative transitions slow down and
</p>
<p>laser oscillation at smaller frequencies is possible. With cooled lead salts, bipolar
</p>
<p>semiconductor lasers up to frequencies of about 8 THz (wavelength 40&micro;m) can be
</p>
<p>produced (Sect. 28.4).</p>

<p>23.8 Energy Bands and Absorption Coefficients
</p>
<p>of GaAs and AlAs
</p>
<p>Figure 23.5 shows dispersion curves of electrons in GaAs and AlAs crystals, with
</p>
<p>the k vector oriented along the 100 direction. The energy bands are periodic with the
</p>
<p>period 2π/(d/2), where d is the cubic lattice constant; the Brillouin zone extends in
</p>
<p>the 100 direction from &minus;2π/d to 2π/d.
</p>
<p>The energy maximum (Ev) of the valence band of GaAs occurs at the same k
</p>
<p>vector as the energy minimum (Ec) of the conduction band&mdash;GaAs is a direct gap
</p>
<p>semiconductor (Fig. 23.5, left). Accordingly, the electronic transitions between the
</p>
<p>two bands of GaAs are strong at frequencies ν &gt; νg; GaAs is transparent for ν &lt; νg .
</p>
<p>The absorption coefficientαabs of GaAs (Fig. 23.6, left) reaches a value of the order
</p>
<p>of 104 cm&minus;1. Population inversion results in a gain coefficient that can, in principle, be
</p>
<p>of the same order of magnitude. That means that a crystal with an inverted population

<p>can have a gain factor G = eαL = e = 2.6 already at a length of 1 &micro;m. The large
</p>
<p>coefficient of absorption due to interband transitions, with a corresponding large gain
</p>
<p>coefficient, in case of a population inversion is the basis of the bipolar semiconductor
</p>
<p>lasers.
</p>
<p>In an absorption process, a photon (momentum �qphoton) is absorbed and an elec-
</p>
<p>tron (momentum �k1) in the valence band is excited to the conduction band where
</p>
<p>it has the momentum �k2. Momentum conservation requires that
</p>
<p>�k1 + �qphoton = �k2. (23.2)
</p>
<p>The sum of the momentum �k1 of a valence band electron and the momentum �qphoton
of a photon has to be equal to the momentum �k2 of the conduction band electron
</p>
<p>after the excitation. Since the momentum of a photon is small compared to the wave
</p>
<p>vector at the Brillouin zone boundary, �qphoton ≪ 2π/d, the condition of an electronic
</p>
<p>transition is
</p>
<p>�k1 &asymp; �k2. (23.3)
</p>
<p>In the energy-wave vector diagram, the transition appears as &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; transition
</p>
<p>(=direct transition).
</p>
<p>AlAs is an indirect gap semiconductor: the minimum of the conduction band
</p>
<p>occurs at a k vector that differs from the k vector at which the maximum of the
</p>
<p>valence band occurs (see Fig. 23.5, right). A transition between a state of maximum
</p>
<p>energy in the valence band and a state of minimum energy in the conduction band is
</p>
<p>possible only by the involvement of a phonon. Momentum and energy conservation
</p>
<p>require that
</p>
<p>�k1 + �qphonon = �k2, (23.4)
</p>
<p>E1 + �ωphonon = E2, (23.5)
</p>
<p>where �qphonon is the momentum, �ωphonon the energy of a phonon, E1 is the energy of
</p>
<p>the valence band electron before excitation, and E2 is the energy of the electron in the
</p>
<p>conduction band (after excitation); the momentum of the photon is negligibly small.
</p>
<p>The transitions at photon energies near the indirect gap energy, Eg,ind = Ec &minus; Ev, of
</p>
<p>AlAs are indirect. The absorption coefficient for these processes is very small (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 23.6, right). Accordingly, the gain of radiation of a frequency near the indirect
</p>
<p>gap frequency νg,ind = (Ec &minus; Ev)/h would be very small even at a strong population
</p>
<p>inversion.

<p>Quantum Well Lasers from the UV

<p>Quantum well lasers are available in a large wavelength range, extending from the

</p>
<p>for red lasers; InP for near infrared lasers; GaN, GaAs or ZnSe for green lasers. We

<p>substrate materials. At each wavelength in the range of 0.3&ndash;2&micro;m, a laser diode
</p>
<p>is in principle available. The materials used for preparing a laser diode must have

<p>24.3 Blue and UV Laser Diodes
</p>
<p>In 1997, S.Nakamura and coworkers at a small Japanese company (NichiaChemicals)
</p>
<p>succeeded in preparing blue diode lasers [196, 203, 204]. In 2014, Nakamura
</p>
<p>received, together with H. Amano and I. Akasaki, the Nobel Price in Physics. The
</p>
<p>basic materials are nitrides (Fig. 24.2b), belonging to the group III&ndash;V
</p>
<p>semiconductors:
</p>
<p>&bull; GaN; Eg = 3.4eV (λg = 365nm).
</p>
<p>&bull; AlN; Eg = 6.2eV.
</p>
<p>&bull; InN; Eg = 1.8eV.
</p>
<p>Ga1&minus;x AlxN and Ga1&minus;x InxN mixed materials are most suitable for preparation of
</p>
<p>blue and near UV laser diodes. Although sapphire (Al2O3) has a large mismatch
</p>
<p>(16%) to GaN, it serves as a substrate; SiC is suitable as substrate too.
</p>
<p>An example of a GaN-based laser diode is shown in Fig. 24.3a. The laser diode
</p>
<p>(emitting at a wavelengths of 413nm) consists of the following layers.
</p>
<p>&bull; InGaN quantum well layers (thicknesses 3nm).
</p>
<p>&bull; GaN barrier layers.
</p>
<p>&bull; GaAlN (p type) electron blocking layer; it acts as a reflector of electrons.
</p>
<p>&bull; GaAlN layers, n-doped on one side and p-doped on the other side of the GaN layer.
</p>
<p>At a wavelength of 400nm, the refractive index of GaN is n = 2.55, while the
</p>
<p>refractive index ofAlGaN is smaller. Dopingwith silicon leads to n-type conductivity
</p>
<p>and doping with magnesium to p-type conductivity.
</p>
<p>The design of a blue laser diode is shown in Fig. 24.3b. The different layers
</p>
<p>are (beginning at the Al2O3 substrate): a very thin undoped GaN layer (e.g., of
</p>
<p>a thickness of 50nm) as buffer layer; an n-doped AlGaN cladding layer; then the
</p>
<p>layers embedding the layers containing the multi-quantum wells (MQWs); finally,
</p>
<p>a p-doped AlGaN cladding layer. The pump current flows from the metallic anode
</p>
<p>through the heterostructure to the metallic cathode.</p>

</p>
<p>24.4 Group II&ndash;VI Materials of Green Lasers
</p>
<p>As already mentioned, green laser diodes consist of GaAs-, GaN- or ZnSe-based
</p>
<p>materials. The ZnSe-based mixed materials have energy gaps between 2 and 4eV
</p>
<p>(Fig. 24.4a). There are various possibilities to prepare mixed crystal materials com-

</p>
<p>Reflectors of Quantum Well Lasers
</p>
<p>and of Other Lasers
</p>
<p>We discuss different reflectors: distributed feedback reflector; Bragg reflector and
</p>
<p>photonic crystal reflector; total internal reflector leading to whispering gallery modes.
</p>
<p>The reflectors are suited as reflectors not only in quantum well lasers but also in
</p>
<p>quantum wire and quantum dot lasers (Chap. 27). Depending on the type of reflector,
</p>
<p>it is possible to design semiconductor lasers of submillimeter size down to (10 &micro;m)3.
</p>
<p>In connection with photonic crystals, we mention the photonic crystal fiber as a
</p>
<p>dielectric light guiding structure. The one-dimensional photonic crystal reflector
</p>
<p>( = Bragg reflector = multilayer reflector) is in use for almost all types of lasers.
</p>
<p>We consider propagation of electromagnetic waves in layered materials (stratified
</p>
<p>media) in the special&mdash;but important&mdash;case that radiation is propagating in the direc-
</p>
<p>tion perpendicular to the layers. We introduce the plane-wave transfer matrix that
</p>
<p>describes transfer of a wave from one side of an interface to the other side&mdash;and the
</p>
<p>propagation matrix, which characterizes propagation of a wave within a medium. The
</p>
<p>plane-wave matrix method is based on the boundary conditions for fields at an inter-
</p>
<p>face. We treat: thin film between two media; dielectric multilayer; one-dimensional
</p>
<p>photonic crystal. We will apply (Sect. 30.3) the plane-wave matrix method also to
</p>
<p>investigate electron waves passing through an interface of two semiconductor media.
</p>
<p>25.1 Plane Surface
</p>
<p>We have already discussed the edge-emitting quantum well laser with two uncovered
</p>
<p>crystal surfaces as reflectors. Cleaving a substrate (together with the layers on the
</p>
<p>substrate) results in a plane surface and cleaving along two parallel planes results
</p>
<p>in a resonator. Disadvantages and advantages of an edge-emitting laser with cleaved
</p>
<p>surfaces (Fig. 25.1a) are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; The reflectivity, determined by the refractive index of the cleaved semiconductors
material has a fixed value.

<p>laser emits radiation in one direction only.</p>

</p>
<p>25.3 External Reflector
</p>
<p>An external reflector (Fig. 25.1c) makes it possible to realize a tunable semiconductor
</p>
<p>laser. The reflector is an echelette grating in Littrow arrangement. Rotation of the
</p>
<p>grating results in a change of the wavelength of the laser radiation. Resonances
</p>
<p>between the surface and the grating are avoided by the use of an antireflecting coating
</p>
<p>(a coating with a low reflectivity, LR) on one of the surfaces of the laser diode. The
</p>
<p>length of the external resonator limits the tuning range&mdash;up to about 50 GHz&mdash;for
</p>
<p>tuning on one mode.
</p>
<p>25.4 Distributed Feedback Reflector
</p>
<p>The integration of a grating into the light guiding structure (Fig. 25.1d) leads to
</p>
<p>distributed feedback. The wavelength of the laser radiation is mainly determined
</p>
<p>by the period of the distributed reflector. Distributed feedback together with coated
</p>
<p>cleaved surfaces makes it possible to optimize the laser output of distributed feedback
</p>
<p>edge-emitting semiconductor lasers.
</p>
<p>Distributed feedback reflectors are also suitable as reflectors of solid state dye
</p>
<p>lasers and organic and polymer lasers (Sect. 34.4).
</p>
<p>25.5 Distributed Bragg Reflector
</p>
<p>A distributed reflection grating separated from the gain region is a distributed Bragg
</p>
<p>reflector (Fig. 25.1e). A distributed Bragg reflector acts as output coupler. The surface
</p>
<p>opposite to the Bragg reflector is highly reflecting.
</p>
<p>By the use of two distributed Bragg reflectors (Fig. 25.1f ), a high reflectivity at
</p>
<p>one end of the active region and an optimized output coupler at the other end can be
</p>
<p>realized.
</p>
<p>Distributed Bragg reflectors are well suitable as reflectors of bipolar semiconduc-
</p>
<p>tor lasers.
</p>
<p>25.6 Total Reflector
</p>
<p>Internal total reflection in a circularly shaped solid results in a resonator with a very
</p>
<p>high Q factor. Light is propagating in a whispering gallery mode (Fig. 25.2). Output
</p>
<p>coupling of radiation is possible by positioning a prism near the surface, resulting in
</p>
<p>frustrated total reflection in a small region of the resonator. The distance d between
</p>
<p>the prism and the surface of the resonator regulates the output power. The quality
</p>
<p>factor can be of the order of 106.</p>

<p>25.7 Bragg Reflector
</p>
<p>A very successful type of reflector is the Bragg reflector (=dielectric multilayer
reflector = 1D photonic crystal reflector); it can consist of a multilayer coating on a
transparent substrate.
</p>
<p>A Bragg reflector (Fig. 25.3, left) consists of dielectric layers of two different
</p>
<p>materials of different refractive indices. Each layer has a thickness that is equal to
</p>
<p>a fourth of the wavelength of radiation in the corresponding material; a material
</p>
<p>(refractive index n1) has the thickness λ/(4n1) and the other material (n2) has the
</p>
<p>thickness λ/(4n2). With increasing number of quarter-wavelength layers (of two
</p>
<p>materials in turn) the reflectivity increases and can reach a value very near unity. A
</p>
<p>Bragg reflector can have a high reflectivity R over nearly one octave of the spectrum
</p>
<p>(Fig. 25.3, right) around a central frequency νBragg. The transmissivity T of the Bragg
</p>
<p>reflector is T = 1 &minus; R. Radiation incident on a Bragg reflector is either reflected or
transmitted. Bragg reflectors are essential for operation of vertical-cavity surface-
</p>
<p>emitting lasers (VCSELs). A Bragg reflector can consist of quarter-wavelength layers
</p>
<p>of two semiconductors&mdash;for instance, of GaAs and AlAs for red and infrared lasers.
</p>
<p>Bragg reflectors (=dielectric mirrors) consisting of other materials (e.g., layers
of two glass types with different refractive indices) can be used as reflectors and as
</p>
<p>partial reflectors of almost all types of lasers (Chaps. 14&ndash;19).</p>

<p>25.8 Photonic Crystal
</p>
<p>A medium that has a spatially periodic dielectric constant is a photonic crystal. A
</p>
<p>medium consisting of a periodic metal structure with holes or dielectric inclusions
</p>
<p>can be a photonic crystal too. All photonic crystals have in common that the light
</p>
<p>propagation is anisotropic and that there can be a photonic bandgap&mdash;radiation of a
</p>
<p>frequency that lies in the bandgap cannot propagate in a photonic crystal. There are
</p>
<p>three types of photonic crystals (Fig. 25.4, upper row):
</p>
<p>&bull; 1D (one-dimensional) photonic crystal. A 1D photonic crystal is, with respect to
the optical properties, periodic in one direction and has no structure along the
</p>
<p>two other directions; the 1D photonic crystal is a three-dimensional medium. The
</p>
<p>frequency spectrum ω(k) can have a gap for electromagnetic waves propagating
</p>
<p>along the direction of periodicity (Sect. 25.14).
</p>
<p>&bull; 2D (two-dimensional) photonic crystal. The 2D photonic crystal is periodic in two
directions and has no structure along the third direction; the 2D photonic crystal
</p>
<p>is a three-dimensional medium. The frequency spectrum ω(k) can show gaps for
</p>
<p>electromagnetic waves with wave vectors in the plane, which contains the two
</p>
<p>directions of periodicity.
</p>
<p>&bull; 3D (three-dimensional) photonic crystal. The 3D photonic crystal is periodic in
three directions. The frequency spectrum ω(k) can show gaps for electromagnetic
</p>
<p>waves in all three spatial directions.

</p>
<p>Fig. 25.5 Elementary cells of 2D photonic crystal lattices
</p>
<p>A photonic crystal of finite length can act as a partial reflector for radiation of a
</p>
<p>photon energy in the photonic gap: radiation incident on a photonic crystal of finite
</p>
<p>thickness is partly reflected and partly transmitted.
</p>
<p>If a single layer of a one-dimensional crystal is missing (Fig. 25.4, lower row), the
</p>
<p>photonic crystal contains a defect (d&lowast;). A photonic crystal with a defect represents a
resonator&mdash;it is a Fabry&ndash;Perot resonator. A two-dimensional photonic crystal with a
</p>
<p>defect can act as a light guide. A three-dimensional crystal with a defect represents a
</p>
<p>cavity-like resonator. In all the three cases (1D, 2D, or 3D photonic crystal), a defect
</p>
<p>can also consist in the modification of more than one structural element.
</p>
<p>Common to all photonic crystals (assumed to have infinite extensions in all three
</p>
<p>directions) is the translational symmetry. A 1D photonic crystal contains a structural
</p>
<p>element that periodically repeats in one direction. There is no structure in the lateral
</p>
<p>directions. A 2D photonic crystal has two axes of periodicity and a 3D photonic
</p>
<p>crystal has three axis of periodicity.
</p>
<p>A 2D photonic crystal can have one of the five different types of lattices (Fig. 25.5):
</p>
<p>square lattice; rectangular lattice; centered rectangular lattice; hexagonal lattice and
</p>
<p>parallelogram lattice.
</p>
<p>A 3D photonic crystal can have one of 14 different lattice types. The simplest
</p>
<p>three-dimensional lattice is the (primitive) cubic lattice.
</p>
<p>25.9 Photonic Crystal Fiber
</p>
<p>A photonic crystal fiber (Fig. 25.6) can consist of a fiber with an internal two-
</p>
<p>dimensional photonic crystal (e.g., a hexagonal two-dimensional lattice). The struc-
</p>
<p>ture is composed of two different glass materials, one with a higher dielectric con-</p>

</p>
<p>A photonic bandgap for propagation of radiation along a direction perpendicu-
</p>
<p>lar to the axis of the two-dimensional photonic crystal avoids spreading of the
</p>
<p>radiation.
</p>
<p>25.10 Remark About Photonic Crystals
</p>
<p>In 1887, Lord Rayleigh explained an experiment, which indicated that a periodic
</p>
<p>dielectric multilayer stack showed a spectral range of high reflectivity [217], cor-
</p>
<p>responding to a stop-band of radiation. Such multilayer stacks (later called Bragg
</p>
<p>reflectors or photonic crystals) are widely studied and applied as reflectors or par-
</p>
<p>tial reflectors. The term &ldquo;photonic crystal&rdquo; describing inhomogeneous but periodic
</p>
<p>structures was introduced by E. Yablonovitch [218] in 1987.
</p>
<p>Reflectors of the two-dimensional photonic crystal type were first used as reflec-
</p>
<p>tors of microwave Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometers in 1957 [219] and of far infrared
</p>
<p>Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometers up to frequencies of several THz in 1962 [220]; a far
</p>
<p>infrared reflector consists of a thin metal mesh and a Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometer of
</p>
<p>two meshes in parallel.

<p>25.14 One-Dimensional Photonic Crystal
</p>
<p>We consider a stratified periodic medium consisting of a series of double layers

<p>(Fig. 25.10). A double layer consists of a layer 1 (refractive n1, thickness a1) and a
</p>
<p>layer 2 (refractive n2, thickness a2). The stratified medium is spatially periodic, the
</p>
<p>spatial period is
</p>
<p>a = a1 + a2. (25.25)
</p>
<p>The unit cell consists of a double layer. We suppose that we have an infinite number
</p>
<p>of cells, numbered l = . . .&minus; 1, 0, 1, . . ..
We study the propagation of a monochromatic plane wave (frequency ω). Our
</p>
<p>goal is to find the dispersion relation ω(k). We use the ansatz (Boch theorem):

<p>Ak(x + a) = Ak(x). (25.27)
</p>
<p>The field E(x) is a Bloch wave. The amplitude varies within a periodicity interval.
</p>
<p>However it is, for a particular k, lattice-periodic. The propagation of the plane wave
</p>
<p>over the distance x causes, as it is typical for plane waves, a change kx . The wave

<p>25.15 Bragg Reflection as Origin of Energy Gaps
</p>
<p>The occurrence of energy gaps is a consequence of the ability of radiation to undergo
</p>
<p>Bragg reflection. Bragg reflection occurs for radiation with discrete values of the
</p>
<p>wave vector, namely for k = kBragg. In the case of a one-dimensional crystal, kBragg =
π/a. A two-dimensional photonic crystal has Bragg vectors that lie on a plane. A
</p>
<p>two-dimensional photonic crystal can show a photonic bandgap (frequency gap) for
</p>
<p>radiation of all k vectors in a plane. A three-dimensional photonic crystal has Bragg
</p>
<p>vectors in the three-dimensional k space. A three-dimensional photonic crystal can
</p>
<p>have energy gaps for k vectors of all spatial directions.</p>

<p>More About the Quantum Well Laser
</p>
<p>We continue the discussion of subbands with a description of wave functions and
</p>
<p>energy bands of electrons in a quantum well. We also show how light holes modify
</p>
<p>the gain profile. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of inhomogeneous broadening
</p>
<p>on the properties of a quantum well laser.
</p>
<p>26.1 Electron Subbands
</p>
<p>Electrons can move freely in the GaAs plane (y, z plane) of a GaAs quantum well
</p>
<p>(Fig. 26.1, left). The motion perpendicular to the plane, along the x direction, is
</p>
<p>spatially limited. The potential energy Epot(x, y, z) of electrons (Fig. 26.1, center) is
</p>
<p>equal to the conduction band profile Ec(x, y, z).
</p>
<p>We treat the GaAs layer as an infinitely extended layer. The Schr&ouml;dinger equation
</p>

<p>Fig. 26.3 Subbands of electrons in a quantum film
</p>
<p>The energy of an electron is given by
</p>
<p>E = E (n)c + E||, (26.13)
</p>
<p>where n is the number of a subband. The conduction band of a quantum layer consists
</p>
<p>of electron subbands. Figure 26.3 (left) shows the zero point energy and the first and
</p>
<p>the second electron subband. The energy of the motion perpendicular to the layer
</p>
<p>is discrete while the motion within the quantum layer corresponds to the motion
</p>
<p>of a free-electron. The density of states in a subband (Fig. 26.3, right) is a constant
</p>
<p>(Problem 27.1):
</p>
<p>D2Dc (ǫ) =
me
</p>
<p>π�2
. (26.14)
</p>
<p>The total density of states is the sum of the densities of states in the different subbands.
</p>
<p>That the density of states of electrons in a quantum film is independent of the
</p>
<p>thickness of the film is plausible: the film thickness determines the zero point energy,
</p>
<p>which is due to the lateral confinement of an electron, while the dispersion relation
</p>
<p>for electrons in a two-dimensional semiconductor determines the propagation along
</p>
<p>the plane.
</p>
<p>The quantum confinement of an electron in a quantum film has consequences:
</p>
<p>&bull; Subbands.
</p>
<p>&bull; Discrete energy values for motion perpendicular to the quantum layer.
</p>
<p>&bull; Zero point energy (E (1)c ). The value of E
(1)
c depends on the thickness s of the
</p>
<p>quantum film.
</p>
<p>&bull; The electrons move freely along the plane of the quantum film.
</p>
<p>&bull; The depth of the quantum well depends on the composition of the GaAlAs layers.
</p>
<p>&bull; The wave functions χ1 and χ2 have cosine and sine shapes within the GaAs
</p>
<p>film material and extend into the confinement material GaAlAs. Their amplitudes
</p>
<p>decrease exponentially with the distance from the GaAs film.</p>

<p>26.2 Hole Subbands 515
</p>
<p>26.2 Hole Subbands
</p>
<p>GaAs and other group III&ndash;V semiconductors have three hole bands (Fig. 26.4): the
</p>
<p>heavy hole band; the light hole band; the split-off band. In a laser diode, the split-off
</p>
<p>band is completely populated and does not play any role. However, the light holes
</p>
<p>(m lh &sim; 0.08 m0) influence the gain coefficient curves.
</p>
<p>In a quantum well, the zero point energy of a heavy hole,
</p>
<p>E (1)v =
π2�2
</p>
<p>2mhs2
, (26.15)
</p>
<p>is by the factor mh/me smaller than the zero point energy of an electron in the
</p>
<p>conduction band while the zero point energy E
(1)
v,lh of the light hole is comparable
</p>
<p>with the zero point energy of a conduction band electron since m lh &sim;me. There is an
</p>
<p>energy range, between E (1)v and E
(1)
v,lh, without light hole energy levels. The density
</p>
<p>of states of light holes is much smaller than that of heavy holes.
</p>
<p>The conduction band states of GaAs have their origin in s-like hybrid states
</p>
<p>composed of s-states of Ga and As atoms. The s-like hybrid states overlap spatially.
</p>
<p>This leads to electron waves extended over the whole crystal and to the conduc-
</p>
<p>tion band (Sect. 30.2); the dispersion relation E(k) characterizes the states of the
</p>
<p>conduction band. The valence band states stem from hybrid states composed of
</p>
<p>p-states (i.e., px , py, pz states) of Ga and As atoms. The three p-state components
</p>
<p>give rise to three different energy bands and dispersion relations&mdash;i.e., a wave func-
</p>
<p>tion of a valence band state can assume, for the same k vector, three different energy
</p>
<p>values. At the Brillouin zone center (k = 0), two of the dispersion curves have the
</p>
<p>same energy value indicating energy degeneracy; however, the two dispersion curves
</p>
<p>have completely different shapes described by the different effective masses,

<p>The third band, the split off band, is shifted to smaller energies relative to the two
</p>
<p>other valence bands due to spin-orbit interaction.
</p>
<p>26.3 Modification of the Gain Characteristic by Light
</p>
<p>Holes
</p>
<p>The quasi-Fermi energy of the electrons in the conduction band is determined by the
</p>
<p>density of nonequilibrium electrons in the electron subband. The quasi-Fermi energy
</p>
<p>of the electrons in the hole subbands follows from the condition
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>f1(D
2D
v + D
</p>
<p>2D
v,lh)dE = N
</p>
<p>2D, (26.18)
</p>
<p>where D2Dv is the density of states of heavy holes, D
2D
v,lh is the density of states of light
</p>
<p>holes and f1 is the Fermi function of the electrons in the heavy hole and light hole
</p>
<p>subbands. The equation yields the quasi-Fermi energy of the valence band electrons.
</p>
<p>In our earlier treatment of quantum wells, we ignored the light hole band. Now, we
</p>
<p>discuss, qualitatively, the modification of a quantum well laser at room temperature
</p>
<p>that is due to the light hole band. Figure 26.5 shows (qualitatively) the occupation
</p>
<p>number difference f2 &minus; f1 for a GaAs quantum well at room temperature, with
</p>
<p>N 2D = 2 &times; 1016 m&minus;2. In comparison with the case of a single hole subband, we
</p>
<p>have a different situation:
</p>
<p>&bull; There are two peaks in the gain characteristic H 2D , which is proportional to
</p>
<p>f2 &minus; f1.
</p>
<p>&bull; The gain curve has a larger width and the maximum of the gain characteristic has
</p>
<p>a smaller value.
</p>
<p>&bull; The actual threshold current density is larger because the holes are distributed
</p>
<p>over two subbands. Since the density of states of the light holes is smaller than the
</p>
<p>density of states of the heavy holes, the increase of the threshold current density
</p>
<p>for laser oscillation is less than a factor of two.
</p>
<p>The theoretical expressions presented in Chap. 21 are suited to perform a quantitative
</p>
<p>analysis. However, we do not deepen the discussion of the gain characteristic.

<p>26.4 Gap Energy of a Quantum Well 517
</p>
<p>26.4 Gap Energy of a Quantum Well
</p>
<p>Taking into account the zero point energy of electrons and holes, we find that the gap
</p>
<p>energy of a quantum well of infinitely high potential walls is equal to
</p>
<p>E2Dg = Eg +
π2�2
</p>
<p>2mr s2
. (26.19)
</p>
<p>Example GaAs quantum film (thickness s = 10 nm) at room temperature
</p>
<p>(� = 1.04 &times; 10&minus;34 J s; m0 = 0.9 &times; 10
&minus;30 kg).
</p>
<p>&bull; Eg = 1.42 eV = gap energy of bulk GaAs.
</p>
<p>&bull; E2Dg = Eg + 61 meV; energy gaps of a GaAs quantum well in the case of infinitely
</p>
<p>high walls.
</p>
<p>&bull; νg = 344 THz; λg = 872 nm.
</p>
<p>&bull; ν2Dg = 358 THz; λ
2D
g = 838 nm.
</p>
<p>The actual zero point energy is smaller because of the finite height of the walls.
</p>
<p>Through the choice of the composition of the quantum film and of the barrier material
</p>
<p>as well as of s, different values of the gap energy E2Dg (&gt; Eg) can be realized .
</p>
<p>26.5 Temperature Dependence of the Threshold Current
</p>
<p>Density of a GaAs Quantum Well Laser
</p>
<p>The electrons occupy energy levels in the electron subband in the range from E2Dc
to EFc, with a spread of kT . The holes in the heavy hole subband occupy energy
</p>
<p>levels between E2Dv and EFv. With increasing temperature, the energy distribution of
</p>
<p>the electrons in the electron subband broadens. The energy distribution of the holes
</p>
<p>in the heavy hole subbands broadens too. It follows that the threshold current of a
</p>
<p>quantum well laser operating at room temperature is much larger than the threshold
</p>
<p>current of a quantum well laser operating at low temperature.
</p>
<p>26.6 Gain Mediated by a Quantum Well
</p>
<p>with Inhomogeneous Well Thickness
</p>
<p>When the thickness of a quantum film is different at different positions of the film,
</p>
<p>interband transitions are inhomogeneously broadened. Both the zero point energies
</p>
<p>E (1)c and E

</p>
<p>for a GaAs quantum well at room temperature, smaller than the broadening (10 meV)
</p>
<p>that is due to the inelastic scattering of the electrons at phonons.
</p>
<p>26.7 Tunability of a Quantum Well Laser
</p>
<p>A single-mode quantum well laser operating at room temperature emits radiation
</p>
<p>at a laser frequency that is determined by the gain characteristic and the resonance
</p>
<p>frequency of the laser resonator. The position of the energy gap, the frequency of
</p>
<p>the maximum of the gain characteristic, and the refractive index of a semiconductor
</p>
<p>depend on temperature. Therefore, the frequency of laser oscillation depends on
</p>
<p>temperature. The temperature of a laser diode changes if the temperature of the
</p>
<p>surrounding or if the current through the diode is varied. A shift of several percent of
</p>
<p>the frequency of a quantum well laser can be achieved. Tuning over a small frequency
</p>
<p>range is possible by the use of an external resonator (Sect. 25.3).
</p>
<p>26.8 Anisotropy of a Quantum Well
</p>
<p>The quantum theory of the optical transitions in a quantum well shows that transitions
</p>
<p>in which heavy holes are involved are only allowed if the electric field vector of the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic field lies in the plane of the quantum well. If light holes are involved,

<p>transitions for the field vector parallel and perpendicular to the quantum well are
</p>
<p>allowed too.

<p>Quantum Wire and Quantum Dot Laser
</p>
<p>The next steps of spatial restriction of free motion of electrons in a semiconductor
</p>
<p>lead to quantum wire lasers and quantum dot lasers.
</p>
<p>A quantum wire is a carrier of electrons, which can move freely in one dimension
</p>
<p>only. The electronic levels form subbands. The density of states of electrons and
</p>
<p>of holes are now characteristic of a one-dimensional semiconductor. We study gain
</p>
<p>mediated by quantum wires and the quantum wire laser.
</p>
<p>In a quantum dot, electrons cannot perform a free motion. The motion of an
</p>
<p>electron is limited by a potential, which is formed by the boundary of a semicon-
</p>
<p>ductor material. (A comparison with electrons in an atom shows: the electrons in
</p>
<p>an atom cannot perform a free motion; the limitation of the motion is due to the
</p>
<p>atomic potential.) We discuss the energy levels of radiative electron-hole pairs in a
</p>
<p>quantum dot and their use in quantum dot lasers. A large number of quantum dots.
</p>
<p>A single quantum dot in a photonic crystal (at low temperature) could be the basis
</p>
<p>of a nanolaser.
</p>
<p>27.1 Quantum Wire Laser
</p>
<p>In the quantum wire laser (Fig. 27.1a), the active medium consists of a quantum
</p>
<p>wire, with a one-dimensional conduction band (the electron subband) and a one-
</p>
<p>dimensional valence band (the hole subband). Stimulated transitions of electrons in
</p>
<p>the conduction band to empty levels of the valence band are the origin of gain. The
</p>
<p>quantum wire (Fig. 27.1b) is embedded in an undoped semiconductor layer, which
</p>
<p>itself is sandwiched between an n-doped layer and a p-doped layer. The undoped layer
</p>
<p>serves as light guide. Under the action of a static voltage, electrons migrate from the n-
</p>
<p>doped layer through the undoped layer into the quantum wire. Correspondingly, holes
</p>
<p>migrate from the p-doped layer into the quantum wire. The direction of the quantum
</p>
<p>wire is perpendicular to the propagation direction of the electromagnetic field.
</p>
<p>The use of a series of parallel quantum wires leads to an enhancement of gain.

</p>
<p>To prepare quantum dots (Fig. 27.4, left), one can make use of the mismatch
</p>
<p>between two materials. The deposition of a small amount of GaInAs on a plane
</p>
<p>GaAs surface results in formation of GaInAs islands. Further deposition of GaAs
</p>
<p>fills up the space between the islands and the GaAs surface becomes plane again. The
</p>
<p>result is a layer with a large number of quantum dots. By further deposition of the two
</p>
<p>materials, it is possible to obtain further layers with quantum dots. A quantum dot can
</p>
<p>have a pyramidal shape (Fig. 27.4, center) of extensions of the order of 10 nm. The
</p>
<p>motion of electrons and holes is restricted with respect to all three spatial directions.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the energy levels are discrete.</p>

<p>A Comparison of Semiconductor Lasers
</p>
<p>The simplest heterostructure laser is the double heterostructure laser. AGaAs double-
</p>
<p>heterostructure consists of three layers: n-doped GaAlAs; GaAs; p-doped GaAlAs.
</p>
<p>It corresponds to two heterostructures, a GaAlAs/GaAs and a GaAs/GaAlAs het-
</p>
<p>erostructure that have in common the GaAs layer. The GaAs layer forms a well&mdash;not
</p>
<p>a quantum well. The well width is so large that the electrons and the holes can, in
</p>
<p>principle,move freely in all three dimensions. The double-heterostructure also acts as
</p>
<p>a light guide. The successful realization of the double heterostructure laser initiated
</p>
<p>the development of the semiconductor lasers with the more complex heterostructures
</p>
<p>that we discussed.
</p>
<p>The junction laser (=homostructure laser = homojunction laser) was the first
</p>
<p>semiconductor laser type. A GaAs junction laser consists of an n-doped GaAs layer
</p>
<p>in direct contact to a p-doped GaAs layer. Without applied voltage, the contact
</p>
<p>(=junction) region is a depletion layer. The contact region does not contain free-
</p>
<p>electrons or free holes.Avoltage applied across the junction causes a drift of electrons
</p>
<p>from the n-doped GaAs into the depletion layer and, at the same time, a drift of holes
</p>
<p>from the p-dopedGaAs into the depletion layer.Recombination of electrons andholes
</p>
<p>in the depletion layer by stimulated optical transitions is the origin of laser radiation.
</p>
<p>The gain region provides a weak light guiding effect. Junction lasers, cooled to liquid
</p>
<p>nitrogen temperature, are available in the infrared spectral range up towavelengths of
</p>
<p>about 30 &micro;m. However, quantum cascade lasers are taking over the tasks of infrared
</p>
<p>junction lasers.
</p>
<p>We show how the laser threshold decreased since the realization of the first semi-
</p>
<p>conductor lasers.
</p>
<p>Finally, we will present a comparison of different types of semiconductor lasers,
</p>
<p>including the quantum cascade laser (that we will discuss in the next chapter). In a
</p>
<p>spectral range&mdash;called the terahertz gap&mdash;semiconductor lasers (quantum cascade
</p>
<p>lasers) are presently in development.

<p>Ferdinand Braun introduced the contact between twomaterials as an important phys-
</p>
<p>ical object. He found that the strength of current flowing in one direction through
</p>
<p>a contact between a metal and a conducting crystal was different from the strength
</p>
<p>of current flowing in the other direction at opposite voltage across the contact. This
</p>
<p>effect led to the first device suitable for rectification of high frequency radiation.
</p>
<p>Later, a contact between n-doped germanium and p-doped germanium was the basis
</p>
<p>of semiconductor junction transistors discovered by Bardeen, Brattain and Shockley.
</p>
<p>Making use of heterostructures instead of contacts represented an essential change in

<p>semiconductor physics. This change began by 1960 and resulted in a miniaturization

</p>
<p>electron gas and the holes a three-dimensional hole gas.

<p>28.2 Double Heterostructure Laser
</p>
<p>As a double heterostructure laser we discuss a GaAs/GaAlAs double heterostructure
</p>
<p>laser (Fig. 28.2, left). The active zone is a GaAs well (thickness 0.2&ndash;1&micro;m) embedded
</p>
<p>in n-dopedGaAlAs and p-dopedGaAlAs.Under the action of a voltage (U ), electrons
</p>
<p>migrate from the n-doped side and holes from the p-doped side into the well. This
</p>
<p>results in nonequilibrium populations of electrons in the conduction band and of
</p>
<p>holes in the valence band. Stimulated recombination of radiative electron-hole pairs
</p>
<p>leads to laser radiation.
</p>
<p>A double heterostructure laser diode (Fig. 28.2, right) consists of different layers
</p>
<p>forming an n GaAlAs/GaAs/p GaAlAs heterostructure grown on a highly doped
</p>
<p>GaAs substrate (dopedwith silicon; electron concentration 2&times; 1024m&minus;3). TheGaAs
</p>
<p>layer, with a larger refractive index than the neighboring GaAlAs material, acts as a
</p>
<p>light guide. The crystal surfaces perpendicular to the light guide serve as reflectors.
</p>
<p>The threshold current is, for N &asymp; Ntr,
</p>
<p>Ith &asymp; Ntra1a2Le/τsp. (28.9)

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28.2 Double Heterostructure Laser 537
</p>
<p>The critical current is much larger than that of a quantum well laser. Below thresh-
</p>
<p>old, the double heterostructure emits luminescence radiation (electro-luminescence
</p>
<p>radiation). Above laser threshold, the quasi-Fermi energies of electrons and holes
</p>
<p>remain at their threshold values. Accordingly, the luminescence spectrum remains
</p>
<p>unchanged when the current exceeds the threshold current (Sect. 21.7).
</p>
<p>28.3 GaAs Junction Laser
</p>
<p>The junction laser (=homostructure junction laser = homojunction laser) contains
</p>
<p>nonequilibriumelectrons andholes in a junctionwithin a homogenous semiconductor
</p>
<p>material.
</p>
<p>The GaAs junction laser (Fig. 28.3a, b) consists of a GaAs crystal, with n-doped
</p>
<p>GaAs adjacent to p-doped GaAs. A voltage (U ) causes a current flow (strength I ).
</p>
<p>Electrons move from one side and holes from the other side into the junction region
</p>
<p>where they recombine by emission of laser radiation. The emission wavelength of a
</p>
<p>GaAs junction laser lies in the near infrared (860nm). Without applied voltage, the
</p>
<p>Fermi energy EF has everywhere within the crystal the same value (Fig. 28.3c). In
</p>
<p>the junction region, there is a depletion zone (thickness &sim;1 &micro;m for carrier densities
</p>
<p>of 1023 m&minus;3 in the n-doped and the p-doped regions) in which no free carriers are
</p>
<p>present. EFc lies above Ec in n GaAs and EFv lies below Ev in p GaAs.

</p>
<p>A junction laser operating at room temperature requires strong cooling.
</p>
<p>In the junction laser, the active layer has a slightly larger refractive index than
</p>
<p>the surrounding n-doped GaAs and p-doped GaAs; the difference of the refractive
</p>
<p>indices is about 0.02. Therefore, there is a (weak) light guiding effect.
</p>
<p>28.4 Junction Lasers in the Infrared
</p>
<p>Infrared junction lasers (Fig. 28.4) consist of mixed crystals of lead salts. Lead salts
</p>
<p>have small energy gaps (PbS, Eg &sim; 270meV; PbTe, 170meV; PbSe, 130meV).
</p>
<p>Mixed crystals of lead salts and tin salts have still smaller gap energies. The lead salt
</p>
<p>lasers operate at low temperature, at the temperature of liquid nitrogen or at lower
</p>
<p>temperature. In principle, it is possible to build a lead salt laser that generates radi-
</p>
<p>ation at a specific wavelength in a large range (4&ndash;30&micro;m). Nonradiative relaxation
</p>
<p>due to electron-hole recombination via phonons limits the wavelength range of lead
</p>
<p>salt lasers at large wavelengths.
</p>
<p>A lead salt laser is tunable on a single mode over a very small frequency range
</p>
<p>by changing the current and the temperature.
</p>
<p>Infrared lasers are especially suitable for detection of spurious gases (e.g., NO,
</p>
<p>NO2) in environmental gases. Today, lead salt lasers cannot compete with quantum
</p>
<p>cascade lasers.
</p>
<p>28.5 Bipolar Semiconductor Lasers: A Comparison
</p>
<p>We have seen that all types of bipolar laser media are in principle suitable as active
</p>
<p>media of edge emitting lasers operating at room temperature. But there are great
</p>
<p>differences.
</p>
<p>&bull; The junction laser requires a large total number of electrons to reach the trans-
</p>
<p>parency density. Therefore, the threshold current is very large.
</p>
<p>&bull; The double heterojunction laser also requires a large total number of electrons.
</p>
<p>The light guiding effect is more favorable than for the junction laser.</p>

</p>
<p>tion of quantum well lasers is possible by mass production: quantum well lasers
</p>
<p>of a high reliability are available.
</p>
<p>&bull; The quantum wire laser is in an early state of development.
</p>
<p>&bull; The quantum dot laser is being developed. The quantum dot lasers can at present
</p>
<p>not yet compete with the quantum well lasers.
</p>
<p>We perform a quantitative comparison of different bipolar lasers operating at room
</p>
<p>temperature (Fig. 28.5). We ask how many excited electrons are necessary to drive a
</p>
<p>bipolar laser in an edge-emitting arrangement that is the same for each of the laser
</p>
<p>types (a1a2L = 100&micro;m&times;200nm&times;1mm = 2&times; 10
&minus;14m3). The arrows indicate the
</p>
<p>total number Ntot = Ntra1a2L of electrons necessary to reach transparency density;
</p>
<p>the total number of electrons at laser threshold, Nth,tot, is only slightly (10%) larger
</p>
<p>than Ntot. We take into account the main broadening mechanisms. The figure shows,
</p>
<p>for each type of lasers, the shape of the reduced density of state curves Dr(hν) and
</p>
<p>the α(hν) curves. All α(hν) curves have the same α scale and the same hν scale.
</p>
<p>The maximum of the gain coefficient curve is equal to threshold gain coefficient.
</p>
<p>An increase of the number of excited electrons (for example, to ten times the total
</p>
<p>number at transparency) allows laser oscillation to occur at frequencies belonging to
</p>
<p>the whole gain bandwidths (=halfwidts of the gain coefficient curves). The survey
</p>
<p>indicates the following.

<p>542 28 A Comparison of Semiconductor Lasers
</p>
<p>Current-driven semiconductor lasers cover different spectral regions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Near UV, visible, near infrared (from about 0.3 to 2&micro;m): quantum well laser.
</p>
<p>&bull; Infrared (2&ndash;25 &micro;m): quantum cascade laser (QCL).
</p>
<p>&bull; Terahertz gap (about 25&micro;m&ndash;1mm; 0.3&ndash;10THz): in this range (that includes the
</p>
<p>sub-THz range from 0.3 to 1THz), there is a gap with respect to semiconductor
</p>
<p>laser oscillators and to quasiclassical semiconductor oscillators operating at room
</p>
<p>temperature (or more general: there is a gap with respect to the availability of solid
</p>
<p>state electronic devices and solid state photonic devices). Quantum cascade lasers
</p>
<p>working at 80K cover a part (60&ndash;300&micro;m; 1&ndash;5THz) of the terahertz gap.
</p>
<p>28.7 Terahertz Gap
</p>
<p>Semiconductor oscillators (Figs. 28.7 and 28.8)&mdash;including both laser oscillators
</p>
<p>and quasiclassical microwave oscillators&mdash;are available from the microwave range
</p>
<p>up to the ultraviolet, however, with the exception of the terahertz gap, a frequency
</p>
<p>range that extends from a sub-THz frequency of about 300GHz (wavelength 1mm)
</p>
<p>to about 30THz. Cooled quantum cascade lases are partly covering the range of the
</p>
<p>terahertz gap.
</p>
<p>Fig. 28.8 Terahertz gap</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28.7 Terahertz Gap 543
</p>
<p>Why are room-temperature quantum cascade lasers not available in the range
</p>
<p>between 4 and 30THz? There are several reasons: The energy difference E2 &minus; E1
is of the order of kT or smaller so that the population difference is smaller than at
</p>
<p>low temperature. Relaxation via phonons is stronger at high temperatures than at low
</p>
<p>temperatures. If the energy difference E2 &minus; E1 coincides with the energy of polar
</p>
<p>optic phonons, relaxation by one-phonon processes occurs, resulting in very short
</p>
<p>lifetimes of electrons in the upper subband (subband 2); the energy of a polar optic
</p>
<p>phonon of GaAs is 36meV (corresponding to a frequency of 8.6THz).
</p>
<p>Another type of unipolar semiconductor laser should be mentioned here, the p
</p>
<p>germanium laser. This is a unipolar semiconductor laser pumped by a current. It is
</p>
<p>operated at temperatures below liquid nitrogen temperature. A current pulse applied
</p>
<p>to a p germanium crystal in a magnetic field gives rise to a nonequilibrium hole
</p>
<p>populationwith a population inversion.By feedbackwith a resonator, laser oscillation
</p>
<p>occurs. The laser is tunable over a very wide frequency range (0.3&ndash;3THz). Tuning
</p>
<p>is possible by varying the strength of the magnetic field.
</p>
<p>There are, furthermore, CO2 laser pumped semiconductor lasers emitting far
</p>
<p>infrared radiation; these have also to be cooled to temperatures below liquid nitrogen
</p>
<p>temperature. The laser transitions occur between discrete energy levels of impurity
</p>
<p>ions in semiconductor crystals.
</p>
<p>We mention semiconductor oscillators of the range of electronics at frequencies
</p>
<p>above 100GHz (see Fig. 28.8).
</p>
<p>&bull; Gunn oscillator (Sect. 31.2). Gunn oscillators are microwave oscillators, commer-
</p>
<p>cially available up to about 200GHz.
</p>
<p>&bull; Semiconductor superlattice oscillator (Sect. 31.3). Semiconductor superlattice
</p>
<p>oscillators (up to 200GHz) are being developed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Resonant tunnel diode oscillator (Sect. 31.7). Operation of resonant tunnel diode
</p>
<p>oscillators have been demonstrated up to 700GHz; however, the output power was
</p>
<p>very small.
</p>
<p>Radiation at frequencies above 100GHz up to 10THz can be generated by frequency
</p>
<p>multiplication of microwave radiation.

</p>
<p>from 200GHz to &sim;1.5THz.

<p>Quantum Cascade Laser
</p>
<p>A quantum cascade laser contains active regions and conducting regions in turn. An
</p>
<p>active region contains three electron subbands. An electron injected into the upper
</p>
<p>subband undergoes a stimulated transition to the lower subband and reaches, after a
</p>
<p>nonradiative relaxation process, the lowest subband. The electron leaves the lowest
</p>
<p>subband by spatial escape to the neighboring conducting region. Then, the elec-
</p>
<p>tron is injected into another upper subband, undergoes another stimulated emission
</p>
<p>process, relaxes, escapes, and so on. Passing, for example, through a hundred gain
</p>
<p>regions, an electron can produce a hundred photons by stimulated transitions. A sin-
</p>
<p>gle gain region is in principle a three-level system. An electron performs a cascade
</p>
<p>of stimulated emission processes in subsequent three-level systems.
</p>
<p>How can we obtain a gain region in a quantum cascade laser and how can we
</p>
<p>inject an electron into a gain region and extract an electron from a gain region?
</p>
<p>We can realize a gain region by the use of coupled quantum wells. Tunnel splitting
</p>
<p>of energy levels leads to appropriate subbands. Superlattices connect next-near gain
</p>
<p>regions. Injection of electrons into a gain region and extraction of electrons from a
</p>
<p>gain region are due to tunneling processes under the action of a static electric field.
</p>
<p>The quantum cascade laser operating at room temperature is a radiation source
</p>
<p>of the infrared; it is available at wavelengths just beyond the wavelengths of bipolar
</p>
<p>lasers, from about 2&ndash;28 &micro;m (11&ndash;150 THz). Quantum cascade lasers cooled to liquid
</p>
<p>nitrogen temperature operate in the frequency range of about 1&ndash;5 THz.
</p>
<p>It is expected that terahertz radiation may be of importance for applications in the
</p>
<p>areas of communications, the environment, medicine, and security. Pioneering work
</p>
<p>is done in infrared and millimeter wave astronomy through the use of oscillators as
</p>
<p>local oscillators of heterodyne detectors (that are most sensitive).

<p>546 29 Quantum Cascade Laser
</p>
<p>29.1 Principle of the Quantum Cascade Laser
</p>
<p>The quantum cascade laser (QCL) is a three-level laser. The three levels (Fig. 29.1a)
</p>
<p>belong to subband 0, subband 1, and subband 2. Under the action of a static field
</p>
<p>Es, electrons are injected into the subband 2 and perform stimulated transitions to
</p>
<p>subband 1. The subband 1 is depopulated by relaxation via the emission of phonons
</p>
<p>and the subband 0 is depopulated by the spatial extraction of electrons. In principle,
</p>
<p>an electron passing through a subband system with 100 periods can produce 100
</p>
<p>photons! Injection occurs by means of a conducting superlattice. In the superlattice
</p>
<p>region, the energy of an electron is energetically constrained to a miniband, i.e., to
</p>
<p>an energy band that is much smaller than an energy band of a bulk semiconductor.
</p>
<p>Extraction occurs to another superlattice. A spatial period is repeated about 100 times
</p>
<p>or more (Fig. 29.1b).
</p>
<p>An external voltage, leading to a voltage U1 per period, drives the electron through
</p>
<p>the cascade system. The voltage per period is approximately
</p>
<p>U1 &asymp; E2 &minus; E0, (29.1)
</p>
<p>where E2, E1, and E0 are levels belonging to the three subbands. The quantum effi-
</p>
<p>ciency ηq &asymp; (E2 &minus; E1)/(E2 &minus; E0) have a value near 1. The overall power efficiency
</p>
<p>can be larger than 0.5.

<p>29.1 Principle of the Quantum Cascade Laser 547
</p>
<p>Under the action of a static field, an electron propagates through a miniband, then
</p>
<p>through a tunnel barrier into the active region with the three subbands and, after an
</p>
<p>optical transition and relaxation, into another miniband. The active region contains
</p>
<p>two coupled quantum wells. A narrow tunnel barrier between the wells provides the
</p>
<p>coupling.
</p>
<p>A minigap (a gap between two minibands) prevents the tunneling of electrons out
</p>
<p>of the subband 2. Perpendicular to the heterostructure, the electrons can move freely.
</p>
<p>The injector consists of a miniband, with a continuously decreasing miniband width,
</p>
<p>realized by quantum film layers and quantum well layers in turn (Sect. 29.3).
</p>
<p>The heterostructure of a quantum cascade laser can be grown by molecular epitaxy.
</p>
<p>29.2 Infrared Quantum Cascade Laser
</p>
<p>The infrared quantum cascade laser (Fig. 29.2) consists of a quantum cascade het-
</p>
<p>erostructure on a conducting substrate (GaP or GaAs). The heterostructure contains
</p>
<p>conduction electrons (&sim;1022 m&minus;3), introduced into the heterostructure during its
</p>
<p>preparation by doping with silicon. An electric power of the order of 1 W (voltage
</p>
<p>5 V; current 0.2 A) leads (in a structure of 1 mm length; 100 &micro;m width; 10 &micro;m
</p>
<p>thickness) to radiation of a power of several mW.

<p>Before discussing the far infrared quantum cascade laser, we introduce superlat-
</p>
<p>tices and minibands.

<p>29.3 Semiconductor Superlattice and Minibands
</p>
<p>Semiconductor superlattices with minibands play an important role for quantum
</p>
<p>cascade lasers. We describe here properties of a GaAs/AlAs superlattice.
</p>
<p>A GaAs/AlAs superlattice (Fig. 29.3) consists of a periodic sequence of GaAs
</p>
<p>layers and AlAs layers. An electron propagating along the superlattice axis experi-
</p>
<p>ences the AlAs layers as potential barriers. The periodic potential leads to minibands
</p>
<p>separated by minigaps. We characterize the dispersion relation of electrons in the
</p>
<p>lowest miniband by:
</p>
<p>ǫ = ǫm
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
&minus;
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
cos kx a
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>, (29.2)
</p>
<p>where ǫ is the energy, ǫm is the miniband width and kx the wave vector along the
</p>
<p>superlattice axis. The dispersion curve is periodic in kx . Therefore, we can restrict
</p>
<p>the wave vector kx to the mini-Brillouin zone &minus;π/a &lt; kx &le; π/a. The calculation
</p>
<p>of minibands is possible by the use of a Kronig&ndash;Penney model (Chap. 30).
</p>
<p>The motion perpendicular to the superlattice axis, within the GaAs layers, corre-
</p>
<p>sponds to a free motion of a conduction electron. The energy of a miniband electron
</p>
<p>is given by
</p>
<p>E = Ec + Ezp + ǫm
</p>
<p>(
</p>

</p>
<p>2mc
. (29.3)
</p>
<p>Ec is the energy of an electron at the minimum of the conduction band and Ezp the
</p>
<p>zero point energy of a miniband electron. The last term corresponds to the energy of
</p>
<p>motion perpendicular to the superlattice axis; mc is the effective mass of an electron
</p>
<p>in the minimum of the conduction band of GaAs.
</p>
<p>The value of ǫm of a GaAs/AlAs superlattice is adjustable by the choice of the
</p>
<p>period a of the superlattice and of the width of the AlAs barrier layers. The largest

<p>29.3 Semiconductor Superlattice and Minibands 549
</p>
<p>value of the miniband width of a GaAs/AlAs superlattice is ǫm &sim; 0.14 eV, which
</p>
<p>corresponds to 10% of the gap energy of GaAs. InGaAs/InGaAlAs superlattices can
</p>
<p>have larger miniband widths (up to 0.3 eV) because the effective mass of a conduction
</p>
<p>electron in InAs is smaller than in GaAs.
</p>
<p>29.4 Transport in a Superlattice
</p>
<p>We discuss the electric transport in a superlattice (miniband transport). A static elec-
</p>
<p>tric field Es oriented along the superlattice axis accelerates the electrons. Relaxation
</p>
<p>gives rise to an ohmic conductivity (Fig. 29.4). The ohmic conductivity is given by
</p>
<p>σ =
N0e
</p>
<p>2τ
</p>
<p>m&lowast;
. (29.4)
</p>
<p>N0 is the density of electrons in a superlattice, m
&lowast; the effective mass of an electron at
</p>
<p>the bottom of the miniband (at kx &asymp; 0), and τ is the intraminiband relaxation time; τ
</p>
<p>&sim; 10&minus;13 s for an electron in a GaAs/AlAs superlattice at room temperature. The value
</p>
<p>of the effective mass m&lowast; depends on the period of the superlattice and the barrier
</p>
<p>width. Ohmic conductivity is limited to not too strong static fields (Sect. 32.3).
</p>
<p>In a superlattice used in a quantum cascade laser as injector (and as extractor),
</p>
<p>the layer thicknesses of GaAs and AlAs&mdash;or of InGaAs and InGaAlAs&mdash;are varying
</p>
<p>along the superlattice axis. Accordingly, the zero point energy, the widths of the
</p>
<p>minibands, and the widths of the minigaps are varying as well. An applied voltage
</p>
<p>leads to a static field along the superlattice axis. The upper boundary of the miniband
</p>
<p>limits the maximum energy an electron can reach in the static field. The first minigap
</p>
<p>prevents escape of excited electrons from the gain region as already mentioned.
</p>
<p>Miniband transport will be treated in more detail in Sect. 32.3.

<p>29.5 Far Infrared Quantum Cascade Laser
</p>
<p>In the far infrared quantum cascade laser (Fig. 29.5), the energy separation between
</p>
<p>sublevel 2 and sublevel 1 corresponds to a frequency in the far infrared. The energy
</p>
<p>difference between the laser levels is of the order of kT at room temperature. To
</p>
<p>reach the threshold population difference, a far infrared QCL has to be cooled, for
</p>
<p>instance to the temperature (77 K) of liquid nitrogen.

<p>Electron Waves in Semiconductor
</p>
<p>Heterostructures
</p>
<p>We study electron waves in one-dimensional potentials and in semiconductor
</p>
<p>heterostructures.
</p>
<p>We will begin with the discussion of the one-dimensional square well potential,
</p>
<p>then describe the origin of energy bands for electrons in a one-dimensional periodic
</p>
<p>potential. We make use of the tight binding method.
</p>
<p>We will introduce the plane-wave transfer matrix method to describe, for an inter-
</p>
<p>face of two semiconductors, how a wave function of a semiconductor continues in
</p>
<p>the other semiconductor. The requirement that the energy flux through a boundary
</p>
<p>is steady provides the boundary conditions for electron waves at an interface of two
</p>
<p>different semiconductors. The plane-wave transfer matrix method allows for deter-
</p>
<p>mination of the energy bands (minibands) of a superlattice. Finally, we will treat the
</p>
<p>quantum well and the double quantum well.
</p>
<p>The plane-wave transfer matrix method is the same we used to describe electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic plane waves in layered systems (Sect. 25.11). The difference of the results
</p>
<p>comes from the different dispersion relations: the wave vector of a free-electron wave
</p>
<p>in vacuum (or in a semiconductor) varies with the square root of energy while the
</p>
<p>wave vector of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum (or in a homogeneous medium)
</p>
<p>shows a linear dependence on frequency.

<p>A Comparison of Laser Oscillators
</p>
<p>and Quasiclassical Solid State Oscillators
</p>
<p>We present three types of quasiclassical oscillators that are able to generate microwave
</p>
<p>radiation of high frequency: Gunn oscillator (used as source of radiation up to
</p>
<p>&sim;200 GHz); superlattice oscillator (in development, up to 200 GHz); resonant-tunnel
</p>
<p>diode oscillator (demonstrated up to 700 GHz). These oscillators are solid state oscil-
</p>
<p>lators, driven by active media. An active medium of a solid state oscillator makes
</p>
<p>use of the nonlinear transport in a semiconductor (Gunn oscillator) or a semicon-
</p>
<p>ductor heterostructure (superlattice oscillator and resonant-tunnel diode oscillator).
</p>
<p>The nonlinear transport is due to a negative mobility of conduction electrons. The
</p>
<p>origin of negative differential mobility is of quantum mechanical nature. However,
</p>
<p>the transport can be described classically.
</p>
<p>A laser oscillator and a quasiclassical solid state oscillator have in common that
</p>
<p>gain is mediated by a high frequency polarization of an active medium and, addition-
</p>
<p>ally, that the active medium experiences a change during the buildup of an oscillation.
</p>
<p>What makes the difference between a laser oscillator and a quasiclassical solid
</p>
<p>state oscillator? In a laser oscillator, polarization occurs via interaction of a high
</p>
<p>frequency field with single particles (atoms, molecules, free-electrons). In a quasi-
</p>
<p>classical solid state oscillator, polarization occurs via interaction of a high frequency
</p>
<p>field with charge density domains, i.e., with collectives of free-electrons. The forma-
</p>
<p>tion of domains and thus of the polarization is due to nonlinear transport properties
</p>
<p>of the active medium&mdash;and not by a population inversion. A quasiclassical solid state
</p>
<p>oscillator shows an upper frequency limit that is determined by a relaxation time; this
</p>
<p>is the time it takes the electrons to establish a collective. Oscillation is only possible
</p>
<p>if the period of the high frequency field is larger than the relaxation time.
</p>
<p>There is, beside the mechanism of interaction of radiation with a medium, a
</p>
<p>difference in the techniques used to couple radiation to a medium. The active medium
</p>
<p>of a laser fills a resonator partly or completely. A solid state diode that drives a
</p>
<p>quasiclassical solid state oscillator can have extensions that are small compared to
</p>
<p>the wavelength of the radiation. An antenna serves for coupling of the active medium
</p>
<p>to the radiation. It is possible to use an active medium of small volume because the
</p>
<p>gain of classical active media can be much larger than the gain of laser media.

<p>568 31 A Comparison of Laser Oscillators and Quasiclassical &hellip;
</p>
<p>According to Kroemer, there are two types of domains and therefore two modes
</p>
<p>of operation of a quasiclassical solid state oscillator&mdash;the pure charge accumula-
</p>
<p>tion mode and the propagating dipole domain mode. Here, we treat the pure charge
</p>
<p>accumulation mode, which is rarely described in textbooks, and we present an exper-
</p>
<p>iment that demonstrates the occurrence of the pure charge accumulation mode in a
</p>
<p>quasiclassical solid state oscillator.
</p>
<p>We will, furthermore, discuss a classical oscillator model&mdash;the van der Pol oscil-
</p>
<p>lator. The model describes an equivalent circuit containing a nonlinear resistance
</p>
<p>that drives a self-excited oscillation in the circuit. The resistance of a van der Pol
</p>
<p>oscillator does not undergo a change during the buildup of an oscillation.
</p>
<p>The chapter provides a connection to textbooks that treat microwave oscillators.

<p>31.1 Interaction of Radiation with an Active Medium
</p>
<p>of a Laser or a Quasiclassical Oscillator
</p>
<p>A comparison of a laser oscillator and a quasiclassical solid state oscillator shows
</p>
<p>the following.
</p>
<p>&bull; A laser oscillator and a quasiclassical oscillator have in common: interaction of an
</p>
<p>active medium with a high frequency field results in a high frequency polarization,
</p>
<p>which is synchronized to the field; mutual interaction of field and polarization leads
</p>
<p>to the buildup of both field and polarization.
</p>
<p>&bull; An active medium of a laser is, with respect to the charge distribution ρ, homoge-
</p>
<p>neous (Fig. 31.1a). The corresponding material equation has the form &nabla; &middot; D = 0.
</p>
<p>An active medium of a laser contains high frequency dipole moments carried
</p>
<p>by atomic excitations. Interaction of these single-particle excitations with a high
</p>
<p>frequency electromagnetic field leads to gain for the high frequency field.
</p>
<p>&bull; In the active medium of a solid state oscillator, the charge distribution is inhomo-
</p>
<p>geneous, &nabla; &middot; D �= 0 (Fig. 31.1b). The periodic buildup and destruction of charge
</p>
<p>density domains gives rise to a high frequency polarization of the active medium.
</p>
<p>A quasiclassical solid state oscillator shows an upper frequency limit that is deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the relaxation time of the electrons, which constitute a domain. The
</p>
<p>material properties responsible for the occurrence of charge density domains are
</p>
<p>based on quantum mechanical properties of a semiconductor (or a semiconductor
</p>
<p>heterostructure).

<p>31.2 Solid State Oscillators 569
</p>
<p>31.2 Solid State Oscillators
</p>
<p>There are various types of solid state oscillators for generation of microwave radia-
</p>
<p>tion. We mention three types.
</p>
<p>&bull; Gunn oscillator. The active device (active medium and electrodes together) of a
</p>
<p>Gunn oscillator is a Gunn diode. We describe a GaAs Gunn diode. The active device
</p>
<p>consists of a doped GaAs layer embedded in highly doped GaAs layers carrying
</p>
<p>metallic contacts. Nonlinearity is due to transfer of conduction electrons from a
</p>
<p>high-mobility state to a low-mobility state in GaAs. The electron transfer, which
</p>
<p>is of quantum mechanical nature, gives rise to a negative differential mobility for
</p>
<p>voltages larger than a critical voltage. The negative differential mobility causes
</p>
<p>formation of charge density domains. Gunn oscillators are available as microwave
</p>
<p>oscillators up to frequencies of &sim;200 GHz. Gunn oscillators are described in many
</p>
<p>textbooks and survey articles; see, for instance, [234&ndash;239].
</p>
<p>&bull; Semiconductor superlattice oscillator. The basis of the nonlinearity of a semi-
</p>
<p>conductor superlattice oscillator is the miniband transport. At voltages across a
</p>
<p>superlattice that are larger than a critical voltage, miniband electrons show a neg-
</p>
<p>ative differential mobility. The negative differential mobility causes formation of
</p>
<p>charge density domains.
</p>
<p>&bull; Resonant tunnel diode oscillator. The active medium is a resonant-tunneling diode
</p>
<p>(Sect. 31.7).
</p>
<p>There are two modes of operation of a Gunn oscillator or of a superlattice oscillator.
</p>
<p>&bull; Pure charge accumulation mode [239] (Fig. 31.2a). Under the action of a static
</p>
<p>field, a negative differential mobility medium extracts electrons from the cathode.
</p>
<p>The excess electrons in the medium and the positive charges at the cathode rep-
</p>
<p>resent a dipole domain connected with a quasistatic polarization of the medium.
</p>
<p>Under the action of both a static field and a high frequency field, the number of
</p>
<p>excess electrons within the medium (and thus the density of positive charge at
</p>
<p>the cathode) increases and decreases periodically at the frequency of the high fre-
</p>
<p>quency field. The corresponding high frequency polarization P mediates gain. In
</p>
<p>the pure charge accumulation mode of operation of an oscillator, negative charge
</p>
<p>flows periodically from the cathode into the negative differential mobility medium
</p>
<p>and back to the cathode while the positive charge is bound to the cathode.

</p>
<p>&bull; Propagating dipole domain mode [239] (Fig. 31.2b). Under the action of a static
</p>
<p>field and of a high frequency field, negative and positive charges within the negative
</p>
<p>differential mobility medium separate giving rise to dipole domains. A dipole
</p>
<p>domain is formed near the cathode, travels through the medium, and disappears at
</p>
<p>the anode. The periodic formation and destruction of domains at the frequency of
</p>
<p>the high frequency field is joined with a high frequency polarization P of the active
</p>
<p>medium. The polarization mediates gain. The formation of propagating domains
</p>
<p>requires special boundary conditions for the field at the boundary between cathode
</p>
<p>and the negative differential mobility medium.
</p>
<p>We will consider a particular solid state oscillator, namely a semiconductor super-
</p>
<p>lattice oscillator, operating in a pure charge accumulation mode.
</p>
<p>31.3 Semiconductor Superlattice Oscillator
</p>
<p>In a semiconductor superlattice oscillator (Fig. 31.3a), a superlattice in a cavity res-
</p>
<p>onator drives the oscillation. The superlattice is electromagnetically coupled to the
</p>
<p>field in the resonator via an antenna (a metal whisker). The antenna is also connected

</p>
<p>to a bias circuit containing a voltage source (voltage U ), which delivers a direct
</p>
<p>current I . A filter in the bias circuit avoids loss of radiation to the bias circuit. Radia-
</p>
<p>tion is coupled out from the resonator via the output port that contains a diaphragm.
</p>
<p>The oscillator is suited to generate microwave radiation. The emission spectrum
</p>
<p>(Fig. 31.3b), of an oscillator generating radiation near a frequency of 64 GHz, shows
</p>
<p>a bandwidth (200 kHz) that is determined by the spectrum analyzer used to regis-
</p>
<p>ter the spectrum. The emission line is, as indicated by the slope in the far wings, a
</p>
<p>Lorentzian line; a small deviation is due to background of the spectrum analyzer. For
</p>
<p>description of a superlattice oscillator, we follow [246].
</p>
<p>Figure 31.3c (points and solid line) shows the output power Pout of the oscillator
</p>
<p>for different strengths η of output coupling loss; a measure of the output coupling
</p>
<p>loss η is the ratio of the aperture area and the area of the completely open output port.
</p>
<p>At small η, with radiation stored in the resonator, Pout is small. With increasing η,
</p>
<p>Pout increases, shows a maximum corresponding to optimum output coupling at ηopt,
</p>
<p>and then decreases to zero at the threshold loss ηth. A solid state oscillator shows an
</p>
<p>oscillation threshold behavior as a laser oscillator does.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the principle of a superlattice oscillator, we consider the current-
</p>
<p>voltage (I &ndash;V ) curve of a superlattice (Fig. 31.4a). With increasing voltage, the current
</p>
<p>increases linearly at small voltage, then less than linearly, reaches a peak value Ip
at a critical voltage Uc, and remains constant for Us &gt; Uc. A static voltage Us &gt; Us
causes the buildup of a high frequency current I (t) and voltage U (t). The active
</p>
<p>medium experiences feedback from the high frequency field stored in the resonator,
</p>
<p>which results in a reduction δ I of the direct current. The current reduction is equal
</p>
<p>to the amplitude of the high frequency current (Fig. 31.4b). The current reduction
</p>
<p>occurs stepwise: at increasing Us, the direct current shows plateau-like slopes. A
</p>
<p>current reduction, indicating oscillation, can occur already for U &lt; Uc.

<p>572 31 A Comparison of Laser Oscillators and Quasiclassical &hellip;
</p>
<p>We conclude from the occurrence of oscillations that the real high frequency
</p>
<p>current and high frequency voltage contain components of opposite phases, i.e., that
</p>
<p>the high frequency resistance of the superlattice is negative, which that is a condition
</p>
<p>of gain. The high frequency resistance is equal to
</p>
<p>Rneg = &minus; Û/ Î . (31.1)
</p>
<p>Û is the amplitude of the high frequency voltage and Î the amplitude of the high
</p>
<p>frequency current.
</p>
<p>Example A particular GaAs superlattice (diameter 4 &micro;m; length 0.6 &micro;m; electron
</p>
<p>density N0 = 5&times; 10
22 m&minus;3) has a critical voltage of 0.6 V and a peak current of
</p>
<p>10 mA. Oscillation at 65 GHz results in a reduction of the current amplitude of
</p>
<p>δ I = Î = 2 mA. The amplitude of the high frequency voltage is Û = 0.9 V (for
</p>
<p>Us = 2 Uc). Thus, the negative resistance is equal to Rneg = &minus;450�. The exper-
</p>
<p>imental output power at optimum output coupling is &sim;0.5 mW corresponding to an
</p>
<p>efficiency of 4% for conversion of electric power to power of microwave radiation.
</p>
<p>31.4 Model of a Solid State Oscillator
</p>
<p>We follow [234]. We characterize a (quasiclassical) solid state oscillator by an equiv-
</p>
<p>alent resonance circuit. The resonance circuit can be a parallel or series resonance
</p>
<p>circuit. We choose a parallel resonance circuit.
</p>
<p>The equivalent circuit (Fig. 31.5a) describes a high frequency circuit containing
</p>
<p>an active device with a negative resistance Rneg, a capacitance C , an inductance L
</p>
<p>and a resistance R, which accounts for loss due to emission of radiation. The active

<p>oscillation, the magnitude of the negative resistance decreases from a small-signal

<p>value to a large-signal value.
</p>
<p>&bull; If the total resistance is positive, an initial high frequency current will be damped
</p>
<p>and oscillation will not start.
</p>
<p>The magnitude of the negative resistance depends on the amplitude of the high

<p>frequency current (Fig. 31.6). The absolute value of Rneg is largest for a small current

<p>phase locking of a classical oscillator to an external (weak) high frequency voltage

<p>(that is delivered, for instance, by a highly stabilized oscillator).
</p>
<p>In comparison with a laser oscillator coupled to an external field&mdash;characterized

<p>The drift velocity-field characteristic (Fig. 31.7b) is expected to have the form of

<p>an Esaki-Tsu characteristic:
</p>
<p>vET = vET,m
2 Es/Ec
</p>
<p>1 + (Es/Ec)2
(31.19)
</p>
<p>Es is the static field, vET,m the maximum drift velocity reached at the critical

<p>field Ec. The differential mobility μ = dvET/d Es is equal to the ohmic mobil-
</p>
<p>ity μohm = 2vET,m/Ec for fields around Es = 0 and is negative for Es &gt; Ec. The
</p>
<p>negative differential mobility has the largest absolute value for E = 1.7 Ec, where
</p>
<p>&micro; = &minus;&micro;ohm/8. We will derive the Esaki&ndash;Tsu characteristic in Sect. 32.3. We will
</p>
<p>show that the critical field is determined by the superlattice period a and a relax-
</p>
<p>ation time τ according to Ec = �/eaτ ; the relaxation time indicates how fast an
</p>
<p>equilibrium is established in an ensemble of free-electrons in a superlattice.
</p>
<p>If the field along the superlattice axis is homogeneous even if the field exceeds

<p>the critical field, we obtain the Esaki&ndash;Tsu I &ndash;V characteristic, which is given by

<p>Ip = πr

</p>
<p>sity increases linearly with the static voltage, n = (1/2)N0Us/Uc. We suppose that
</p>
<p>the positive charges are distributed on a plane (at the cathode) adjacent to the super-
</p>
<p>lattice boundary. The excess charge within the superlattice is equal to the positive
</p>
<p>charge at the cathode (Fig. 31.8b, upper part). The density of the excess charge in

<p>excess charge in the superlattice together with the positive charge at the cathode
</p>
<p>form a dipole domain (Fig. 31.8b, lower part). It consists of a charge density domain
</p>

</p>
<p>P(Us) = &minus;n(Us)el/2. The direction of polarization is opposite to the direction of

</p>
<p>The density n(Us) increases with increasing Us (Fig. 31.9a). If the voltage across

</p>
<p>flow into the superlattice until the excess charge density is equal to n(Us + U1) in

</p>
<p>during an oscillation cycle
</p>
<p>Under the influence of both a static and a high frequency voltage, the high fre-
</p>
<p>quency voltage causes a periodic change of polarization. The temporal change of
</p>
<p>polarization is equal to a polarization-current density. A high frequency voltage (fre-
</p>
<p>quency νc) of a rectangular shape (Fig. 31.9b) produces a polarization that has, in
</p>
<p>a simplified picture, a triangular shape and is phase-shifted by π/2. The current
</p>
<p>has a rectangular shape and is phase-shifted by π relative to the voltage. A Fourier
</p>
<p>transformation yields the amplitude Û = (4/π) U1 of the high frequency voltage
</p>
<p>U = Û cosωt and the amplitude P̂ = nel/2π of the high frequency polarization
</p>
<p>P = P̂ sinωt . The high frequency polarization current is equal to I = &minus; Î cosωt ,
</p>
<p>where Î = πr2ω P̂ = r2lνne is the amplitude of the current; the high frequency
</p>
<p>polarization-current is continued outside the superlattice by a high frequency cur-
</p>
<p>rent (flowing through the antenna). For static voltages that are noticeably larger than
</p>
<p>Uc, the electrons are not fast enough to follow the high frequency voltage. There-
</p>
<p>fore, the effective length leff of an excess charge domain is shorter than l. We write
</p>
<p>leff = 0.2vET,m/vc. The product nleff (= 1.2 N0l) and thus P̂ are independent of Us.
</p>
<p>We obtain a constant current amplitude

<p>Î = 1.2 r2νl N0e. (31.25)

<p>Thermal radiation in a resonator is amplified according to the small-signal negative

<p>resistance Racc,0. Due to fluctuations of amplified thermal radiation, a superlattice
</p>
<p>can be promoted into a state of larger negative resistance. If this resistance reaches
</p>
<p>Racc, stable oscillation can occur. The resistance Racc corresponds to the threshold
</p>
<p>resistance Rth since, for R &lt; |Rth|, feedback is strong enough to start oscillation.
</p>
<p>Then at steady state oscillation, the superlattice resistance |Racc| assumes the value
</p>
<p>R. Because of fluctuations of the field, i.e., because of noise, oscillation can occur
</p>
<p>also for Us &lt; Uc.
</p>
<p>It follows from (31.19) that the small-signal Esaki-Tsu differential resistance,

<p>In the voltage range of oscillation, the small-signal Esaki&ndash;Tsu resistance RET,0
is comparable with the large-signal resistance Racc. However, the absolute value of
</p>
<p>the large-signal Esaki&ndash;Tsu negative resistance RET is smaller than the absolute value
</p>
<p>of RET,0 according to the slope of the Esaki&ndash;Tsu I &ndash;V curve. Therefore, |Racc| is
</p>
<p>larger than |RET|. This means that the interaction of the high frequency field with an
</p>
<p>electron collective of a pure charge accumulation mode is associated, with respect
</p>
<p>to the negative resistance, with a larger nonlinearity than the interaction of the high

<p>The electric field associated with a domain has a triangular shape, with a low-field

</p>
<p>carries the field energy πr2lǫǫ0(E2 &minus; E1)
2/2. The field energy of a domain stems</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>582 31 A Comparison of Laser Oscillators and Quasiclassical &hellip;
</p>
<p>from the high frequency field in the resonator. During a half cycle of the field, the
</p>
<p>domain transfers its field energy to the high frequency field and during the following
</p>
<p>half cycle, energy of the high frequency field is used to build up the field of the
</p>
<p>domain.
</p>
<p>Energy balance requires that the power delivered by the voltage source is equal
</p>
<p>to the sum of the losses (we modify a discussion in [236]):
</p>
<p>πr2lνN0eUs = πr
2lνN0eE1l + Pout + Pdom. (31.33)
</p>
<p>The loss terms concern:
</p>
<p>&bull; πr2lνN0eE1l = loss due to the current carried by the electrons (of density N0).
</p>
<p>&bull; Pout = loss due to output coupling of radiation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Pdom = loss due to dissipation caused by relaxation processes during domain for-
</p>
<p>mation and destruction.
</p>
<p>We find
</p>
<p>Us = E1l + Urad + Udom, (31.34)
</p>
<p>where Urad = Pout/(πr
2lνN0e) and Udom = Pdom/(πr
</p>
<p>2lνN0e). The static voltage
</p>
<p>across the superlattice is equal to the sum of three terms: the voltage necessary to drive
</p>
<p>the normal electrons by the field E1; the voltage Urad necessary to compensate loss of
</p>
<p>radiation and the voltage Udom necessary for compensation of energy of dissipation
</p>
<p>associated with domains. The normal electrons drift with the average velocity v(E1)
</p>
<p>through the superlattice. The domains, with the positive charges bound to the cathode,
</p>
<p>appear and disappear at the repetition rate ν.
</p>
<p>Example (for the superlattice already discussed) For Us = 2 Uc (=1.2 V) and
</p>
<p>Prad = Pout at optimum output, the analysis yields the data: E1 = 0.7 Ec; E2 = 4
</p>
<p>Ec; E1l = 0.5 V; Urad = 0.25 V; Udom = 0.5 V. Accordingly, the dissipation energy
</p>
<p>is, for Us = 2 Uc, equal to half the field energy of a fully developed domain. The
</p>
<p>direct current strength is determined by the drift velocity at the lower field and is
</p>
<p>given by the expression Idc/Ip = N0ev(E1)/Ip (&sim;0.8).
</p>
<p>The upper limit frequency νlimit is determined by the intraminiband relaxation of
</p>
<p>the electrons in a superlattice. It follows from the intraminiband relaxation time (1.5
</p>
<p>&times; 10&minus;13 s) that νlimit is &sim;1 THz. The appropriate superlattice length, according to the
</p>
<p>relation νc = 0.4 νET,m/ l has a value of &sim;10 nm. This means that we are no longer
</p>
<p>dealing with a superlattice but with a resonant-tunneling diode like structure (next
</p>
<p>section).
</p>
<p>A more detailed discussion of the pure charge accumulation mode observed for
</p>
<p>superlattice oscillators can be found in [246]. The study presents a method that is
</p>
<p>suited to investigate the mechanism of gain of a solid state oscillator. Such studies may
</p>
<p>contribute to an improvement of the efficiency of microwave oscillators, particularly
</p>
<p>in the range above 100 GHz.</p>

<p>31.7 Resonant-Tunneling Diode Oscillator 583

<p>31.7 Resonant-Tunneling Diode Oscillator
</p>
<p>The resonant-tunnel diode oscillator [234, 247] is a quasiclassical solid state oscilla-
</p>
<p>tor that reaches very high oscillation frequencies. Because of small radiation power,
</p>
<p>resonant-tunneling diode oscillators are not in use.
</p>
<p>A resonant-tunneling diode (Fig. 31.11a) consists, for instance, of two AlAs lay-
</p>
<p>ers separated by a GaAs layer, embedded in n GaAs. The layers form a quantum
</p>
<p>well with a discrete energy level for electron motion perpendicular to the layers.
</p>
<p>Under the action of a static voltage Us, electrons tunnel through the quantum well
</p>
<p>from one n GaAs region to the other n GaAs region, which results in a current. If the
</p>
<p>energy of the tunneling electrons coincides with the energy of the discrete energy
</p>
<p>level (Fig. 31.11b), the tunnel current has a maximum as indicated in the I &ndash;V curve
</p>
<p>(Fig. 31.11c). The I &ndash;V curve has, for a voltage above a critical voltage Uc, a neg-
</p>
<p>ative slope, which corresponds to a negative differential resistance. The I &ndash;V curve
</p>
<p>is a hypothetical curve: because of the negative differential resistance, the charge
</p>
<p>distribution is inhomogeneous.
</p>
<p>The negative differential resistance gives rise to a self-excited oscillation if the
</p>
<p>active element is coupled to a resonance circuit; the oscillation frequency is deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the resonator. Radiation generated in first order has been observed in
</p>
<p>frequency ranges from 10 GHz up to several hundred GHz. The power decreased
</p>
<p>strongly at frequencies above 100 GHz. The highest frequency of radiation emitted

<p>31.8 Van der Pol Oscillator
</p>
<p>We discuss a model of a classical electric oscillator, namely the van der Pol oscillator.
</p>
<p>The active device is a resistance that shows a negative differential resistance above
</p>
<p>a critical voltage Uc (Fig. 31.12a); the I&minus;V curve resembles the hypothetical I&minus;V
</p>
<p>curve of the resonant-tunneling diode. Under the action of a static voltage (bias
</p>
<p>voltage U0), with the resistance coupled to a resonant circuit, a self-excited oscillation
</p>
<p>can occur. It is characteristic of this classical oscillator model that the current through
</p>
<p>the active device and the voltage across the device always follow the I&minus;V curve and
</p>
<p>that the curve does not change during buildup of an oscillation.
</p>
<p>To study basic properties of a classical oscillator, we introduce an I&minus;V curve
</p>
<p>(Fig. 31.12b) that has, around the range of negative shape, a similar slope as the
</p>
<p>hypothetical I &ndash;V curve of the resonant-tunneling diode and can be described by an
</p>
<p>analytical expression,
</p>
<p>I (U ) = I0 &minus; a (U &minus; U0)+ b (U &minus; U0)

<p>for U = U0. The slope of the I&minus;V curve according to (31.35) is unrealistic for
</p>
<p>voltages U ≪ U0 and U ≫ U0. In the range around U0, it shows for appropriate

</p>
<p>Superlattice Bloch Laser: A Challenge
</p>
<p>The superlattice Bloch laser (also called Bloch oscillator) exists only as an idea.
</p>
<p>We discuss this type of laser for two reasons. First, a superlattice Bloch laser would
</p>
<p>provide a semiconductor source of coherent radiation in the 1&ndash;10THz range&mdash;with
</p>
<p>operation at room temperature. Second, there are, with respect to the formal descrip-
</p>
<p>tion of a Bloch laser medium, many similarities to a free-electron laser medium,
</p>
<p>although the origin of gain is completely different.
</p>
<p>In a superlattice Bloch laser, free-electrons in a semiconductor superlattice per-
</p>
<p>form, under the action of a static electric field directed along the superlattice axis,
</p>
<p>Bloch oscillations. The oscillation frequency (=Bloch frequency = resonance fre-
</p>
<p>quency) is determined by the strength of the static field and the period of the superlat-
</p>
<p>tice. A high frequency electric field, also oriented along the superlattice axis, causes
</p>
<p>a phase modulation of the Bloch oscillations. This results in a high frequency drift
</p>
<p>current along the superlattice axis. Interaction of the high frequency drift current
</p>
<p>with the high frequency electric field mediates gain for the high frequency field; gain
</p>
<p>is due to transfer of energy of translation of the electrons to energy of the high fre-
</p>
<p>quency field. The Bloch frequency increases linearly with the strength of the static
</p>
<p>field. Frequency tuning over a large range is possible by changing the static field
</p>
<p>strength, that is, the voltage across a superlattice. The amplitude of the high fre-
</p>
<p>quency field in an active medium of a Bloch laser medium is limited; even if the high
</p>
<p>frequency field in the laser resonator has no loss, the field cannot exceed a saturation
</p>
<p>field&mdash;conventional lasers do not have such a limitation.
</p>
<p>Suitable as an activemedium is a semiconductor superlattice submitted to a homo-
</p>
<p>geneous static electric field Es of a strength that is larger than a critical field Ec.
</p>
<p>However, under this condition, the electrons tend to form charge density domains,
</p>
<p>which destroy the homogeneity of the field. We will mention methods that may be
</p>
<p>suited to avoid domains.
</p>
<p>We study transport properties of a superlattice in a homogeneous electric field&mdash;
</p>
<p>assuming that the field remains homogeneous even if Es &gt; Ec. We characterize
</p>
<p>Bloch oscillations and derive the current-voltage characteristic of a superlattice.

<p>592 32 Superlattice Bloch Laser: A Challenge
</p>
<p>We derive the small-signal gain coefficient and the saturation field amplitude. Gain
</p>
<p>can occur up to the Bloch frequency νB.
</p>
<p>We also present an energy-level description of the superlattice Bloch laser. The
</p>
<p>energy levels of an electron,which executesBlochoscillations, formanenergy-ladder
</p>
<p>system (a Wannier&ndash;Stark ladder): the energy levels are equidistant and have a next-
</p>
<p>near energy distance of hνB. In this description, radiation is generated by stimulated
</p>
<p>transitions of electrons. An electron, which occupies a level of the energy-ladder
</p>
<p>system, emits a photon by a transition to a distorted state at an energy slightly above
</p>
<p>the next near energy level at lower energy.
</p>
<p>32.1 Principle of a Superlattice Bloch Laser
</p>
<p>Figure32.1 illustrates the principle of a superlattice Bloch laser. A voltage source
</p>
<p>(voltage Us) produces a direct current (I ) that flows as electron current through an
</p>
<p>n-doped semiconductor superlattice. In the superlattice, miniband electrons carry the
</p>
<p>current. The miniband electrons execute&mdash;under the action of the static field along
</p>
<p>the superlattice axis&mdash;free-electronoscillations (=Blochoscillations). The resonance
</p>
<p>frequency of a free-electron oscillator is the Bloch frequency
</p>
<p>νB =
eaEs
</p>
<p>h
. (32.1)
</p>
<p>Es is the strength of the static field within the superlattice and a the superlattice
</p>
<p>period. The Bloch frequency is proportional to Es and to a.
</p>
<p>We assume that a superlattice fills a resonator, which is formed by the metallic
</p>
<p>anode, the metallic cathode, and four free surfaces of the superlattice. Interaction of
</p>
<p>the electrons, performing Bloch oscillations, with a high frequency electric field can
</p>
<p>result in gain (Bloch gain) for the high frequency electric field. Radiation (power
</p>
<p>Pout) is coupled out via free surfaces of the superlattice.
</p>
<p>The gain coefficient is, approximately, given by (Sect. 32.4):

<p>to energy relaxation. Therefore, the dephasing time is equal to the energy relaxation
</p>
<p>time of an electron.)
</p>

<p>32.2 Bloch Oscillation 597
</p>
<p>We describe an electron propagating in x direction as a wave packet composed
</p>
<p>of plane waves of different wave vectors kx that has a central wave vector kx,c. The
</p>
<p>central wave vector corresponds to a de Broglie wavelength λdB = 2π/kx,c. In the
</p>
<p>following, we consider the temporal change of the central wave vector under the
</p>
<p>influence of a force. We omit, for convenience, the subscript &ldquo;c&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>We first study the motion of an electron under the action of a static electric field
</p>
<p>Es along the x axis. The field leads to acceleration of an electron (charge q = &minus;e)
</p>
<p>according to the equation of motion
</p>
<p>�dkx/dt = q Es. (32.12)
</p>
<p>In this semiclassical equation of motion, �kx plays the role of the classical momen-
</p>
<p>tum; see, for instance, [179]. The equation (also called acceleration theorem) corre-
</p>
<p>sponds to Newton&rsquo;s equation of motion in classical physics. The solution is
</p>
<p>kx = (q Es/�)(t &minus; t0), (32.13)
</p>
<p>where t0 is the time the electron starts with the wave vector kx = 0. The wave vector
</p>
<p>increases linearly with time. Multiplying kx by a, we find that the phase
</p>
<p>kx a = (qaEs/�) (t &minus; t0) (32.14)
</p>
<p>increases linearly with time. The group velocity is

(32.16)
</p>
<p>is the maximum group velocity and ωB the Bloch frequency, which is given by the
</p>
<p>relationship
</p>
<p>ωB = eaEs/�. (32.17)
</p>
<p>The maximum group velocity increases proportional to ǫm. The Bloch frequency
</p>
<p>is proportional to the strength of the static field. The energy �ωB is the energy an
</p>
<p>electron can gain in the field Es when it travels over of a superlattice period a. An
</p>
<p>electron executes Bloch oscillations with the period TB = 2 π/ωB.
</p>
<p>An electron starting with k(t0) = 0 is accelerated, reaches themini-Brillouin zone
</p>
<p>boundary after TB/2 (see Fig. 32.3a), experiences a Bragg reflection, is decelerated
</p>
<p>until it begins a new oscillation cycle. The group velocity of the electron wave packet

</p>
<p>a Bragg reflection when the de Broglie wavelength is equal to twice the spatial period
</p>

<p>the shape of real part of the response function is a Lorentz dispersion function

</p>
<p>(see also Sect. 19.9):
</p>
<p>Saturation of the high frequency electric field occurs if the modulation degree
</p>
<p>assumes the critical modulation degree μc = 1.
</p>
<p>We consider the phase difference between the transverse oscillation of an electron
</p>
<p>and the high frequency electric field,
</p>
<p>φ(x) = x &minus; μ sin ax, (32.59)
</p>
<p>where x = ωBt is the phase for μ = 0 and a = (ωB &minus; ω)/ωB is the difference of
</p>
<p>the frequencies of the Bloch oscillation and the high frequency electric field, divided
</p>
<p>by ωB. Without modulation (μ = 0), the phase φ increases linearly with time (if
</p>
<p>intraminiband relaxation is ignored). In the case that a high frequency electric field
</p>
<p>modulates the electron oscillation, the phase difference oscillates around the φ(t) =
</p>
<p>x(t) line. The amplitude of this oscillation increases with increasing μ. The phase
</p>
<p>difference φ increases continuously with time as long as μ &lt; 1. However, for μ &gt;
</p>
<p>1, the same phase difference can be obtained for two different times. The change
</p>
<p>from the continuous increase to the more complicated behavior occurs at the critical
</p>
<p>modulation index μc. We find the value of μc from the condition that the derivative
</p>
<p>dφ/dx is zero, dφ/dx = 1&minus; μ a = 0, which leads (for a ≪ 1) to
</p>
<p>μc =
1
</p>

<p>degree is limited to unity, leads to a well understandable result. We discuss the
</p>
<p>current-field curve together with the high frequency electric field (Fig. 32.10). The
</p>
<p>instantaneous field, which is the sum of the static field Es and the high frequency
</p>
<p>field E , causes the electrons to perform Bloch oscillations resulting in gain for the
</p>
<p>high frequency field. However, if the instantaneous field is smaller than the critical
</p>
<p>field Ec, the instantaneous field gives rise to loss of radiation. Therefore, maximum
</p>
<p>gain is expected for |A| &le; Es &minus; Ec. This corresponds, for ωBτ ≫ 1, to the condition
</p>
<p>Asat = Es. The quantities in the current-field curve are: Ip, peak current; δ I , excess

<p>32.6 Energy of Distortion in a Bloch Laser
</p>
<p>In the state of saturation, a high frequency electric field is present and interacts
</p>
<p>stronglywith theBlochoscillations.Accordingly, absorption compensates stimulated
</p>
<p>emission of radiation. However, it is not clear, how the state of saturation is realized.
</p>
<p>The modulation current may have a phase of π/2 relative to the current as in the
</p>
<p>case of resonance absorption. This appears to be unlikely because distortion of the
</p>
<p>oscillating state seems to be disregarded.
</p>
<p>We rather suggest that the phase between themodulation current of theBlochoscil-
</p>
<p>lation and the high frequency electric field is equal to π or 0. The two corresponding
</p>
<p>oscillation states allow for the strongest interaction between Bloch oscillation and
</p>
<p>high frequency field. In order to find a possible origin of saturation, we determine the
</p>
<p>work done by the electron during a cycle of a Bloch oscillation. The work is given
</p>
<p>by
</p>
<p>W1,φ=0 = &minus;ev0 Asat
</p>
<p>&int; T
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>cos(ωBt) cos(ωt)dt. (32.66)
</p>
<p>The solution is, with ω0 &asymp; ω equal to
</p>
<p>W1,φ=0 = &minus;π ev0 Asat/ω. (32.67)
</p>
<p>We now assume that the work results in a distortion of the electron oscillation and
</p>
<p>that the distortion occurs if the work is equal to the distortion energy E&lowast;, i.e., we
</p>
<p>assume that
</p>
<p>W1,φ=0 = &minus;E
&lowast;. (32.68)
</p>
<p>Comparison of (32.67) and (32.68) provides the saturation field amplitude
</p>
<p>Asat =
E&lowast;ωB
</p>
<p>πev0
.</p>

</p>
<p>Since we know Asat, we find the distortion energy,
</p>
<p>E&lowast; =
πev0 Asat
</p>
<p>ωB
. (32.69)
</p>
<p>It follows that
</p>
<p>E&lowast; = (π/2)ǫm.
</p>
<p>The distortion energy is equal to the miniband width (multiplied by π/2). We can
</p>
<p>write the condition in the form
</p>
<p>e a Asat = (2/π)�ωB. (32.70)
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the saturation energy is reached,when themaximumenergy gainwithin
</p>
<p>a period a of the superlattice is equal to the quantum energy of a photon (multiplied
</p>
<p>by π/2).
</p>
<p>The distortion changes the phase of the oscillation by π . After a change of the
</p>
<p>phase, the reversed process occurs: the field transfers energy to the electron. The
</p>
<p>work is given
</p>
<p>W1,φ=π = ev0 Asat
</p>
<p>&int; T
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>cos(ω0t) cos(ωt)dt = +πev0 Asat/ω, (32.71)
</p>
<p>or,
</p>
<p>W1,φ=π = +E
&lowast;. (32.72)
</p>
<p>A process of repairing a distortion follows on a process that leads to distortion of
</p>
<p>an electron oscillation. At saturation, absorption compensates stimulated emission
</p>
<p>of radiation. On average, there is no energy exchange between the electrons and the
</p>
<p>high frequency field.
</p>
<p>The saturation field amplitude does not depend on the length of the Bloch laser
</p>
<p>medium. Doubling of the length of the Bloch laser medium results in a shortening
</p>
<p>of the oscillation onset time.
</p>
<p>32.7 Synchronization of Bloch Oscillations to a High
</p>
<p>Frequency Field
</p>
<p>The dynamics of synchronization of the high frequency drift current to a high fre-
</p>
<p>quency electric field can be analyzed by studying the temporal change of the wave
</p>
<p>vector of an electron. The method, leading to phase space bunching (k-space bunch-
</p>
<p>ing), has been introduced by Kroemer [258]. We illustrate the result of the gain cal-
</p>
<p>culation. Electrons in a static field perform Bloch oscillations at the Bloch frequency.
</p>
<p>The oscillations of different electrons are uncorrelated to each other (Fig. 32.11, left).</p>

</p>
<p>trajectories of two electrons submitted to both a static and a high frequency field
</p>
<p>The average high frequency current at the Bloch frequency is zero. A high frequency
</p>
<p>field (frequency ω) forces the electrons to oscillate with the same average phase rel-
</p>
<p>ative to the phase of the field (Fig. 32.11, right). For ω = ωB, the phase between the
</p>
<p>current and the field is π /2. There is, in the time average, no net exchange of energy.
</p>
<p>For ω &lt; ωB, the phase is larger than π /2 and gain occurs while at ω &gt; ωB, the phase
</p>
<p>is smaller than π /2, which corresponds to absorption.
</p>
<p>In a static field along the superlattice axis, the wave vector of an electron
</p>
<p>increases linearly with time. We restrict the wave vector to the mini-Brillouin zone
</p>
<p>(Fig. 32.12a). An electron (with a path represented by the dotted line) that starts with
</p>
<p>the initial wave vector k(t0) = 0 experiences a Bragg reflection after half a period
</p>
<p>and then after each further period TB = 2π/ωB of the Bloch frequency. An elec-
</p>
<p>tron with the initial wave vector k(t0) = &minus;π/a (solid line) undergoes the first Bragg
</p>
<p>reflection after one temporal period, the second after two periods and so on. The
</p>
<p>k-space trajectories are straight lines.</p>

<p>Modulation of the Bloch oscillations causes a change of the trajectories.
</p>
<p>Figure32.12b shows the trajectories of the two electrons if a high frequency field
</p>
<p>(dashed in the lower part of the figure), which has the same period as the Bloch oscil-
</p>
<p>lation (T = TB), is applied in addition to the static field. The electron startingwith the
</p>
<p>initial wave vector k(t0) = 0 traverses the range of large wave vector (kx &sim; &plusmn;π/a)
</p>
<p>slower thanwithoutmodulationwhile the electron startingwith the initialwave vector
</p>
<p>k(t0) = &minus;π/a traverses the range of large wave vector faster. Relaxation processes
</p>
<p>occur preferably when an electron has a wave vector near the minizone boundary:
</p>
<p>due to its large energy, a zone boundary electron can lose energy by interaction with
</p>
<p>phonons (particularly optical phonons). The &ldquo;most stable trajectory&rdquo; is the trajectory
</p>
<p>of the electron with the initial wave vector k(t0) = &minus;π/a. Electrons starting with
</p>
<p>other initial wave vectors relax by phonon emission (vertical waved lines) toward
</p>
<p>the most stable trajectory. The electrons experience k-space bunching. The k-space
</p>
<p>bunching corresponds to synchronization of the Bloch oscillations to the high fre-
</p>
<p>quency field.
</p>
<p>The k-space bunching causes gain or loss, depending on the frequency of the high
</p>
<p>frequency field (for ωBτ ≫ 1):
</p>
<p>&bull; ω = ωB. Velocity v1 and high frequency field have a phase of π/2 relative to each
</p>
<p>other. The Bloch oscillations of all miniband electrons are perfectly synchronized
</p>
<p>to the field. However, there is, on average, no net exchange of energy.
</p>
<p>&bull; ω &lt; ωB. The phase between velocity and high frequency field lies between π/2
</p>
<p>and 3π/2. The electron oscillations mediate transfer of potential energy to the high
</p>
<p>frequency field. The average drift velocity of an electron is increased. Since the
</p>
<p>frequencies are different, dephasing occurs permanently. Due to phase relaxation
</p>
<p>processes, synchronization occurs again and again.
</p>
<p>&bull; ω &gt; ωB. The phase between velocity and high frequency field lies between 0
</p>
<p>and π/2 or between 3π/2 and 2π . The electron oscillations mediate transfer of
</p>
<p>radiation energy to potential energy of the electrons. The average drift velocity
</p>
<p>of an electron is decreased. Since the frequencies are different, dephasing occurs
</p>
<p>permanently. Due to energy relaxation processes, synchronization occurs again
</p>
<p>and again.
</p>
<p>In all three cases, modulation of the Bloch oscillations by the high frequency field
</p>
<p>results in a current at the frequency of the high frequency field.

</p>
<p>E0 = hνB is the energy separation between next near energy levels (=transition

</p>
<p>radiation interacts via spontaneous emission, absorption and stimulated emission
</p>
<p>according to the Einstein coefficients. However, absorption and stimulated emission
</p>
<p>processes have the same transition probability (Fig. 32.13b). Therefore, the average
</p>
<p>rate of absorption processes is the same as the average rate of stimulated emission
</p>
<p>processes if the frequency of the radiation is exactly equal to the resonance frequency,
</p>
<p>i.e., if ν = νB. The description as a frequency modulation (Sect. 32.4) indicates that
</p>
<p>stimulated emission prevails if ν &lt; νB and absorption if ν &gt; νB. Accordingly, the
</p>
<p>gain curve is a Lorentz dispersion curve rather than a Lorentz resonance curve.
</p>
<p>In a strong electromagnetic field, transitions between next-near levels are also
</p>
<p>allowed as multiphoton transitions (Fig. 32.13c) according to the condition
</p>
<p>nhν = E0 = hνB; n = 1, 2, . . . . (32.74)
</p>
<p>The cases n&gt;1 correspond to velocity components of higher order according to
</p>
<p>(32.37).
</p>
<p>Whether a radiation field experiences a population inversion in the Bloch laser
</p>

<p>E0 is converted to photon energy hν and distortion energy Edist,

</p>
<p>is equal to twice the period of the Bloch frequency, τstim = 2/νB. This analysis is
</p>
<p>consistent with data of Table32.1. The time τstim given in the table is an average time
</p>
<p>between two stimulated emission processes for the case that radiation is coupled out

<p>nance frequency of the resonator is determined by the length L , the width a1 of the

<p>resonator, and the optical properties of the superlattice material. Superlattices with
</p>
<p>extensions LSL up to &sim;10 &micro;m can be grown by molecular epitaxy. The laser fre-
</p>
<p>quency is expected to correspond to the lowest order resonance of the resonator. Bias

<p>oscillations should be avoidable by the use of filters in the bias circuit. The output
</p>
<p>power is determined by the saturation field amplitude, the output coupling strength,
</p>
<p>and the area of two opposite output surfaces; the mismatch between the superlattice
</p>
<p>and air should provide sufficient feedback.
</p>
<p>Another possible arrangement is shown in Fig. 32.16b. The superlattice is coupled
</p>
<p>to a resonator via an antenna. In this case, the resistance of the superlattice has to
</p>
<p>be matched to the resonator. The frequency is determined by the geometry of the
</p>
<p>resonator and the resistance of the superlattice in the active state. In this arrangement,
</p>
<p>superlattices with much smaller extensions and thus less heating would be appro-
</p>
<p>priate. However, the preparation of the resonator and the filter would require more
</p>
<p>effort.

<p>32.10 References to the Bloch Laser and Discussion
</p>
<p>In 1928, Felix Bloch (then a Ph.D. student of Werner Heisenberg) described [251]
</p>
<p>a one-dimensional quantum theory of the electric conductivity of crystals and intro-
</p>
<p>duced a number of basic concepts that allow for a description of properties of con-
</p>
<p>duction electrons in a crystal,
</p>
<p>&bull; The (one-dimensional) tight binding method.
</p>
<p>&bull; Energy bands.
</p>
<p>&bull; The acceleration theorem of conduction electrons.
</p>
<p>Bloch also realized that energy relaxation via phonons is a necessary condition for
</p>
<p>the occurrence of electric conduction in a crystal. Without energy relaxation, a con-
</p>
<p>duction electron interacting with a static electric field is accelerated and decelerated
</p>
<p>in turn. On time average, there is no transfer energy from a field to an electron or
</p>
<p>vice versa. Zener [252] introduced the term Bloch oscillations for the motion of a
</p>
<p>free-electron subject to both a periodic potential and a static field.
</p>
<p>Keldish [253] proposed to prepare superlattices by means of very-high frequency
</p>
<p>ultrasonic waves (that have wavelenghths of the order of 10nm). Esaki and Tsu [254]
</p>
<p>made the proposal to prepare composite semiconductor superlattices and to study
</p>
<p>transport properties of doped superlattices. Ktitorov et al. [255] were the first to
</p>
<p>predict Bloch gain. In their theory, based on one-dimensional Boltzmann transport
</p>
<p>equations, they included elastic scattering of the electrons and thermal distribution
</p>
<p>of electrons in a miniband of a superlattice at finite temperature, leading to the
</p>
<p>temperature parameter f (T ); see also [256, 257]. Kroemer [258] showed that Bloch
</p>
<p>gain canbe attributed to k-space bunching.Blochgain and k-space bunchinghave also
</p>
<p>been treated in gain calculations using a three-dimensional Monte&ndash;Carlo technique
</p>
<p>[259, 260].
</p>
<p>The method of molecular beam epitaxy made it possible to prepare semiconduc-
</p>
<p>tor superlattices, to study transport properties of doped superlattices [261], and to
</p>
<p>investigate response of oscillating electrons to a terahertz field [262, 263]. Evidence
</p>
<p>of Bloch gain of THz radiation has been reported by Allen et al. [264].</p>

<p>It is an open question whether it is possible to avoid formation of space charge
</p>
<p>domains in a superlattice in order to realize a THz Bloch laser. Proposals concern
</p>
<p>the use of weakly doped superlattices [264, 265] and the use of an additional THz
</p>
<p>radiation source [266]. A microwave-terahertz double oscillator is another proposal
</p>
<p>[246]. The idea is to operate a superlattice as a microwave oscillator (for instance,
</p>
<p>at a frequency near 65GHz) based on domains as described in Sects. 31.3&ndash;31.6. The
</p>
<p>use of a lossless microwave resonator may lead, during a certain time during each
</p>
<p>microwave period, to a homogeneous field distribution that may be associated with
</p>
<p>Bloch gain at THz fields. If a superlattice is coupled, at the same time, to amicrowave
</p>
<p>resonator and to a resonator for a THz field, a THz field may be amplified during a
</p>
<p>part of each cycle of a microwave oscillation.
</p>
<p>Bloch oscillations of miniband electrons have been observed by the use of fem-
</p>
<p>tosecond optical techniques [267, 268]; for surveys, see [269, 270].
</p>
<p>Wannier&ndash;Stark ladders andBlochoscillations are discussed in [271].Willenberg et
</p>
<p>al. [272] introduced intermediate states (distorted states) inWannier-Stark ladders for
</p>
<p>calculation of the small-signal gain coefficient. Johannes Stark (1874&ndash;1957; born in
</p>
<p>Freihung, Bavaria) predicted and observed the Stark effect [273], namely the splitting
</p>
<p>of energy levels of atoms and molecules in electric fields. In 1919, he received the
</p>
<p>Nobel Prize in Physics. Gregory Wannier (1911&ndash;1983; born in Basel, Switzerland)
</p>
<p>developed the Wannier functions [274, 275].
</p>
<p>Finally, we discuss the question of the upper limit frequency of a Bloch laser. The
</p>
<p>limit is determined by the condition that the length of the trajectory of a Bloch oscil-
</p>
<p>lation should be larger than a superlattice period. This leads to a limiting frequency,
</p>
<p>where ξ = 2 a of&sim;15THz for a GaAs/AlAs superlattice (with amaximumminiband
</p>
<p>width of 140meV) and &sim;30THz of an InGaAs/InAlAs superlattice. Gain can also
</p>
<p>occur at larger frequencies via stimulated transitions between Wannier&ndash;Stark states
</p>
<p>that are localized within a few superlattice periods or within one period [270]. In
</p>
<p>the range of infrared active phonons (near 8THz) intrinsic absorption caused by an
</p>
<p>infrared active lattice vibration can be stronger than gain.

<p>Optical Communications
</p>
<p>An important field of application of lasers is optical communications by means of
</p>
<p>glass fibers.
</p>
<p>To transfer information over very large distances (e.g., around the world), radiation
</p>
<p>of a wavelength of 1.55 &micro;m is most suitable by two reasons. First, glass fibers have
</p>
<p>the smallest loss of radiation in a wavelength band around 1.55 &micro;m. Second, a glass
</p>
<p>fiber amplifier&mdash;the erbium-doped fiber amplifier&mdash;allows for amplification of laser
</p>
<p>radiation at 1.55 &micro;m. A glass fiber with integrated light amplifier (installed every
</p>
<p>100 km) can transport information over any distance on earth.
</p>
<p>The transfer of optical waves over shorter distances (up to about 50 km) is possible
</p>
<p>with radiation at wavelengths around 1.32 &micro;m. At this wavelength, the absorptivity
</p>
<p>of glass fibers is also small and the dispersion is zero (resulting in less distortion of
</p>
<p>optical pulses in comparison to pulses of 1.55 &micro;m radiation). However, there is no
</p>
<p>efficient light amplifier available for 1.32 &micro;m radiation.
</p>
<p>In the past, the transfer rate increased more and more. The use of radiation at many
</p>
<p>wavelengths at the same time&mdash;corresponding to many frequency bands available
</p>
<p>for information transfer&mdash;and increase of the modulation bandwidth enhanced the
</p>
<p>transfer rate. For long-distance transfer of information via fiber-optic cable networks,
</p>
<p>a frequency band of about 5 THz is available; the width of the band corresponds to
</p>
<p>about 2.5% of an average frequency (about 200 THz) of radiation of the 1.55 &micro;m
</p>
<p>band.
</p>
<p>33.1 Principle of Optical Communications
</p>
<p>The basis of optical communications is the guidance of light by means of optical
</p>
<p>fibers. The principle of optical communications is illustrated in Fig. 33.1. Light,
</p>
<p>coupled by means of a transmitter into a fiber, propagates through the fiber to a
</p>
<p>receiver. For long-distance transfer, the fiber contains laser amplifiers. The following
</p>
<p>components belong to an optical transfer system.

<p>Of course, communication with free light waves is also possible. On earth, it is

</p>
<p>that is necessary for changing the propagation direction of light.
</p>
<p>33.2 Glass Fiber
</p>
<p>Glass fibers can be prepared with high accuracy from quartz glass. A glass fiber
</p>
<p>(Fig. 33.1) consists of two parts.
</p>
<p>&bull; Core. Diameter about 10 &micro;m; SiO2 doped with germanium; refractive index
</p>
<p>n0 = 1.52.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cladding (mantle). Diameter about 80 &micro;m; SiO2; n1 = 1.48.
</p>
<p>The basis of the guidance of light is the total reflection. The light is propagating
</p>
<p>in the 00 mode of a fiber (monomode fiber). The field distribution is Gaussian like.
</p>
<p>The amplitude of the field is large within the core and decreases exponentially in the
</p>
<p>mantle. Accordingly, a portion of the light is propagating in the core, another portion
</p>
<p>in the mantle. While a Gaussian beam in free space is always divergent, a Gaussian
</p>
<p>like beam in a fiber remains confined.</p>

</p>
<p>Light in a glass fiber experiences damping (Fig. 33.2, upper part). The damping
</p>
<p>has two minima at slightly different wavelengths.
</p>
<p>&bull; 1.32 &micro;m; damping 0.4 dB/km.
</p>
<p>&bull; 1.55 &micro;m; damping 0.2 dB/km.
</p>
<p>Toward small wavelengths, the damping increases because of Rayleigh scattering.
</p>
<p>This is a consequence of small irregularities at the interface between core and mantle.
</p>
<p>Toward large wavelengths the damping increases due to absorption caused by lattice
</p>
<p>vibrations (phonons) in glass. OH impurities in glass are responsible for an absorption
</p>
<p>line near 1.4 &micro;m. The OH concentration (5 ppm) in a glass fiber corresponds to 1 OH
</p>
<p>group per 2 &times; 108 SiO2 molecules.
</p>
<p>33.3 Pulse Distortion Due to Dispersion
</p>
<p>A light pulse propagating in a fiber is damped and changes its shape. This is due to
</p>
<p>dispersion (Fig. 33.2, center). The dispersion is zero at 1.32 &micro;m. It has a value of
</p>
<p>about 15 ps per km and nm at 1.55 &micro;m. The dispersion relation of light in an isotropic
</p>
<p>medium (refractive index n) is
</p>
<p>ω = vphk =
c
</p>
<p>n
k, (33.1)
</p>
<p>where ω is the angular frequency, vph the phase velocity, and k the wave vector. The
</p>
<p>refractive index of SiO2 glass (Fig. 33.2, lower part) shows in the near infrared a
</p>
<p>weak decrease with increasing wavelength and a point of inflection at 1.32 &micro;m. We
</p>
<p>can write the dispersion relation in the form</p>

</p>
<p>33.4 Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier
</p>
<p>In a long distance fiber cable, an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) compensates
</p>
<p>damping of radiation.
</p>
<p>Light is amplified (Fig. 33.3) by stimulated transitions in Er3+ ions that are pumped
</p>
<p>with radiation of a semiconductor laser (wavelength 1,480 nm or 980 nm). The
</p>
<p>erbium-doped glass amplifier can amplify radiation in the range of 1,520&ndash;1,560 nm.
</p>
<p>The relative bandwidth (δν/ν &sim; 2.6%) corresponds to a bandwidth δν &sim; 5 THz at
</p>
<p>the frequency ν &sim; 2 &times; 1014 Hz. Thus, the band available near 200 THz for optical
</p>
<p>communications has a width of about 5 THz. The mechanism of gain of radiation in
</p>
<p>an erbium fiber is discussed in Chap. 18; see, particularly, Fig. 18.1.
</p>
<p>A fiber amplifier consists of an erbium-doped region of a long glass fiber cable.
</p>
<p>pump radiation of a semiconductor laser is coupled into a fiber via an optocoupler.
</p>
<p>An amplifier (length 30 m) has a gain factor of the order of 1,000 (gain 30 dB). In
</p>
<p>parallel to a a long-distance fiber cable, there is a current carrying cable delivering
</p>
<p>the electric energy necessary to operate the pump laser of the erbium-doped fiber
</p>
<p>amplifier.</p>

<p>Photodiodes are suitable as detectors of radiation in optical communication systems.
</p>
<p>A silicon pin photodiode (Fig. 33.4) consists of a thin p-doped silicon layer, an

</p>
<p>A transparent metallic anode film on the p-doped silicon layer and a metal cathode
</p>
<p>on the backside of the substrate serve as metallic contacts. A light pulse traversing
</p>
<p>the anode film creates electron-hole pairs in the intrinsic layer. A static voltage across
</p>
<p>the photodiode accelerates electrons and holes, created by a light pulse, giving rise
</p>
<p>to an electric pulse that is registered electronically.
</p>
<p>33.6 Transfer Rates
</p>
<p>The transfer rates of large-distance communication systems increased permanently.
</p>
<p>&bull; Before 1996, a copper cable in the ocean reached a transfer rate of 280 Mbit/s

<p>Light Emitting Diode and Organic Laser
</p>
<p>The development of semiconductor lasers is accompanied by the development of
</p>
<p>light emitting diodes (LEDs). An LED, based on spontaneous electron-hole recom-
</p>
<p>bination, does not require a cavity and can therefore have a simpler design than a
</p>
<p>laser. We discuss properties of diodes and mention various areas of applications.
</p>
<p>There is a growing market of LEDs as lighting sources. Superluminescent semi-
</p>
<p>conductor diodes can reach high efficiencies. Stimulated emission just below laser
</p>
<p>threshold is favorable for a high efficiency. In 2014, S. Nakamura, H. Amano, and I.
</p>
<p>Akasaki received the Nobel Prize in physics for the invention of efficient blue light
</p>
<p>emitting diodes, which has enabled bright and energy-saving light sources.
</p>
<p>Besides the LED, the organic LED (OLED) is being developed. The basis of the
</p>
<p>OLED is the spontaneous recombination of electrons and holes in molecular crystals
</p>
<p>or polymers. Production of OLEDs is possible at low costs as large-area films suitable
</p>
<p>for outdoor lighting of large areas.
</p>
<p>We will also mention organic lasers.
</p>
<p>34.1 LED Preparation and Market
</p>
<p>An LED converts electric power into light. Most efficient are LEDs based on direct
</p>
<p>semiconductors.
</p>
<p>In an LED, electrons and holes recombine giving rise to spontaneous emission of
</p>
<p>radiation at frequencies near the gap frequency of a semiconductor. An LED is easier
</p>
<p>to prepare than a laser diode. Antireflecting coatings ensure that the active medium
</p>
<p>of an LED experiences almost no feedback or only a weak feedback from radiation
</p>
<p>reflected at the crystal surfaces. Thus, the light is incoherent. An LED emits the light
</p>
<p>into a large solid angle.
</p>
<p>Of great importance for the development of the LED market was the discovery
</p>
<p>of the blue LED (in 1992); see Sect. 1.9, Nobel Prizes. The lifetime of an industrial
</p>
<p>LED lies in the range of 10,000&ndash;100,000 h of operation. Already in 2006, about 25
</p>
<p>billion LEDs (about 60% InGaN LEDs, 38% AlInGaP LEDs, and 2% LEDs of other

<p>materials) have been prepared, mainly by metal oxide chemical vapor deposition
</p>
<p>(MOCVD). The size of a chip is typically 250 &micro;m &times; 250 &micro;m.
</p>
<p>The luminous efficiency of LEDs was (by 2006) about 50 lm/W (lumen per watt
</p>
<p>electric power). The record in the laboratory was 100 lm/W. The goal of the devel-
</p>
<p>opment is a further increase of efficiency. The luminous flux (in units of lm) is
</p>
<p>a measure of power of light perceived by the human eye. The power of broadband
</p>
<p>visible radiation (e.g., from a blackbody source) of 1 mW corresponds to about 15 lm.
</p>
<p>A superluminescent LED is based on stimulated emission below laser threshold.
</p>
<p>Figure 34.1 shows the principle of the superluminescent LED (=high-power LED =
</p>
<p>laser diode operating below threshold). Under the action of a voltage U (current I ),
</p>
<p>electrons migrate from the n-doped material into quantum wells and holes migrate
</p>
<p>from the p-doped material into the quantum wells. Radiation is generated by electron-
</p>
<p>hole recombination in the quantum wells. Antireflecting coatings on the surfaces
</p>
<p>avoid cavity resonances. The superluminescent LED has a broad output spectrum,
</p>
<p>like an LED. The power can be as large as that of a corresponding laser diode. The
</p>
<p>light has a higher directionality than the light of a normal diode.
</p>
<p>The market is permanently growing. More than 100 firms are worldwide active
</p>
<p>in the LED industry. In 2005, the LED market had a turnover of 4 billion US $. The
</p>
<p>main portion concerned mobile phones. Although prices of LEDs steadily decrease,
</p>
<p>it is expected that the turnover would double every five years. The growth rate of
</p>
<p>the LED market with respect to the number of LEDs was (2010) &sim;50% per year.
</p>
<p>The largest growth is expected in various fields&mdash;illumination; full color displays;
</p>
<p>television and monitor screens; outdoor large-area screens; and projectors.
</p>
<p>34.2 Illumination
</p>
<p>Besides the use of LEDs for color applications (screens, traffic lights), the generation
</p>
<p>of white light is of great importance. We compare different illumination elements.
</p>
<p>&bull; Light bulb. Radiative efficiency about 20 lm/W (efficiency of conversion of electric
</p>
<p>power into light &sim;4%); 1,000 h of operation; for 1US $, one obtains 800 lm.
</p>
<p>&bull; Energy-saving lamp. Radiative efficiency&sim;50 lm/W. The energy-saving lamp con-
</p>
<p>tains mercury, which should be avoided in future. In the energy-saving lamp
</p>

</p>
<p>US $ per year in the year 2025. Worldwide, the generation of light consumes about
</p>
<p>20% of the total electric power. The replacement of bulbs is a worldwide task.
</p>
<p>A problem concerns the quality of the white light produced with LEDs. Many
</p>
<p>people have the feeling that the light is cold. This feeling has a physical background.
</p>
<p>The light emitted by a phosphor, irradiated by an LED, does not have the same
</p>
<p>spectrum as the radiation of a light bulb. If white light is generated by three LEDs
</p>
<p>emitting radiation in the red, yellow and blue spectral regions, the radiation is, of
</p>
<p>course, also quite different from white light of a light bulb.
</p>
<p>34.3 Organic LED
</p>
<p>It is possible to produce organic LEDs of large areas at a low price per square meter.
</p>
<p>The luminous efficiency is about 30 lm/W. There are worldwide efforts to increase
</p>
<p>the efficiency and to improve the reproducibility.
</p>
<p>The center of an organic LED (OLED) is a molecular layer or a polymer layer
</p>
<p>sandwiched between electric contact layers. The organic LED (Fig. 34.3a) consists
</p>
<p>in principle of 3 layers on a substrate:
</p>
<p>&bull; Metal contact.
</p>
<p>&bull; Organic layer.
</p>
<p>&bull; Transparent conductor (e.g., indium tin oxide) as a metallic contact.
</p>
<p>&bull; Transparent polymer substrate.
</p>
<p>Under the action of a static field produced by a voltage (U ) between the metal
</p>
<p>contacts, electrons migrate into the organic layer from one side and holes from the
</p>
<p>other side. Electron-hole recombination generates light.
</p>
<p>In the organic LED, molecular levels (Fig. 34.3b) play an essential role. The

principle of the organic LED
</p>
<p>organic LED has occupied energy levels that have a broad energy distribution and,
</p>
<p>separated by a gap, empty levels that have also a broad energy distribution. An
</p>
<p>electron excited in a molecule migrates via a hopping process to another molecule.
</p>
<p>The holes migrate via hopping processes too. Characteristic energy levels are:
</p>
<p>&bull; E1,max = highest energy of occupied energy levels.
</p>
<p>&bull; E2,min = lowest energy of empty molecular energy levels.
</p>
<p>&bull; E2,min &minus; E1,max = energy gap.
</p>
<p>A voltage U forces electrons to drift from the cathode and holes from the anode
</p>
<p>through the molecular film. Electron-hole recombination leads to generation of lumi-
</p>
<p>nescence radiation. The voltage is equal to the energy difference between the Fermi
</p>
<p>energy EF,c of the cathode material and the Fermi energy EF,a of the anode material,
</p>
<p>eU = EF,c &minus; EF,a.
</p>
<p>Special emphasis lies in the choice of the cathode and anode materials. The cathode
</p>
<p>material has a work function Wcathode that has a similar value as E2,min (related to
</p>
<p>the vacuum level Evac). The anode material has a work function Wanode &sim; E1,max.
</p>
<p>Appropriate materials are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Cathode materials. Calcium, lithium, magnesium or alloys of these materials.
</p>
<p>&bull; Anode materials. Indium tin oxide (InSnO2) film; this is transparent for visible
</p>
<p>radiation.
</p>
<p>Without voltage, there is a built-in potential, establishing a constant Fermi level over
</p>
<p>the whole device. By application of a sufficiently large voltage, a nonequilibrium
</p>
<p>state with electrons and holes gives rise to the electron-hole recombination and to
</p>
<p>luminescence radiation.</p>

<p>34.4 Organic and Polymer Lasers
</p>
<p>Operation of optically pumped organic lasers and optically pumped polymer lasers
</p>
<p>has been demonstrated for wavelengths in the whole visible spectral range [285&ndash;
</p>
<p>296]. Organic and polymer lasers are bipolar lasers (Fig. 34.4). We can describe a
</p>
<p>polymer laser (or an organic laser) as a two-quasiband laser, with an upper quasi-
</p>
<p>band and a lower quasiband. The upper quasiband consists of energy levels of excited
</p>
<p>molecules. An excited molecule can transfer its excitation energy to a nonexcited,
</p>
<p>neutral molecule. Energy transfer is possible via the F&ouml;rster mechanism and other
</p>
<p>energy transfer processes (Sect. 18.2). Optical pumping and intramolecular relax-
</p>
<p>ation leads to quasithermal population in the upper quasiband. The density of states
</p>
<p>D2(E) = D2(ǫ2), of the levels in the upper quasiband depends on the molecular
</p>
<p>properties of the polymer; ǫ2 = E &minus; E2,min is the energy within the upper quasiband.
</p>
<p>Injection of electrons leads to band filling, characterized by the quasi-Fermi energy
</p>
<p>E2,F (ǫ2,F).
</p>
<p>Extraction of electrons from nonexcited molecules results in a nonequilibrium
</p>
<p>distribution of empty levels in the lower quasiband. Energy transfer is again possible
</p>
<p>via energy transfer processes. Intramolecular relaxation processes are responsible
</p>
<p>that the occupied levels if the lower quasiband have also a quasithermal distribution.
</p>
<p>The density of states, D1(E) = D1(ǫ1), of the levels of the lower quasiband depends
</p>
<p>on the molecular properties too; ǫ1 = E1,max &minus; E is the energy within the lower
</p>
<p>quasiband. Extraction of electrons leads to empty levels in the lower quasiband,
</p>
<p>characterized by the quasi-Fermi energy E1,F (ǫ1,F).

<p>Nonlinear Optics
</p>
<p>The polarization of a dielectric medium depends nonlinearly on the amplitude of
</p>
<p>the electromagnetic field. Nonlinear dielectric media are suitable for frequency con-
</p>
<p>version of radiation. Nonlinear media can be crystals, glasses, liquids or vapors. We
</p>
<p>discuss: frequency multiplication; difference frequency generation; parametric oscil-
</p>
<p>lation; four wave mixing; stimulated Raman scattering. In connection with four-wave
</p>
<p>mixing, we show how the frequencies of a frequency comb can be determined.
</p>
<p>We will present only a very narrow view on the fascinating field of Nonlinear
</p>
<p>Optics. Our main aspect concerns the question: how can we convert coherent radiation
</p>
<p>of one frequency to coherent radiation of other frequencies?
</p>
<p>35.1 Optics and Nonlinear Optics
</p>
<p>In Maxwell&rsquo;s theory, the matter equations describe the electric properties of a dielec-
</p>
<p>tric medium are expressed by the relation between the dielectric polarization P of
</p>
<p>the medium and the electric field E in the medium,
</p>
<p>P = P(E). (35.1)
</p>
<p>In Optics (Linear Optics), the relation is
</p>
<p>P = ε0χ
(1)
</p>
<p>E, (35.2)
</p>
<p>where χ (1) is the (complex) dielectric susceptibility. The susceptibility of an opti-
</p>
<p>cally isotropic medium is a scalar. It is a tensor if a medium is anisotropic. The
</p>
<p>polarization has the same frequency as the electromagnetic field. The susceptibility
</p>
<p>χ (1)(ω) characterizes optical properties of a material. The study of χ (1)(ω) leads to
</p>
<p>an understanding of basic microscopic properties of matter.

<p>Fig. 35.1 Nonlinear
</p>
<p>polarization
</p>
<p>The basis of Nonlinear Optics is the nonlinearity of the polarization at large
</p>
<p>amplitudes of the electric field (Fig. 35.1). We characterize the polarization by the
</p>
<p>relation
</p>
<p>P = ε0χ
(1)E + ε0χ
</p>
<p>(2)E2 + ε0χ
(3)E3 + . . . (35.3)
</p>
<p>We make use of two simplifications. We neglect the vector character of E and P
</p>
<p>as well as the tensor properties of χ (1), χ (2), χ (3) etc. We assume that the field
</p>
<p>is spatially homogeneous in the direction of a light beam&mdash;we ignore that the field
</p>
<p>changes the phase during propagation. Thus, we neglect phase effects, which can be of
</p>
<p>great importance. Nevertheless, the simplified representation of the relation between
</p>
<p>polarization and field allows for developing an understanding of the principle of
</p>
<p>generation of radiation by means of the nonlinear polarization. Nonlinear polarization
</p>
<p>is applicable, for instance, to convert monochromatic radiation to radiation at other
</p>
<p>frequencies.
</p>
<p>The electric field that causes a polarization can consist of fields of different fre-
</p>
<p>quencies. We can write, instead of (35.3),
</p>
<p>P = ε0χ
(1)E + ε0χ
</p>
<p>(2)E1 E2 + ε0χ
(3)E1 E2 E3 + . . . , (35.4)
</p>
<p>where E1, E2, . . . are fields of different frequencies and where E = E1 + E2 + . . .
</p>
<p>is the sum of the fields.
</p>
<p>35.2 Origin of Nonlinear Polarization
</p>
<p>At which amplitude of an electromagnetic field do we expect a nonlinear polarization?
</p>
<p>We consider a hydrogen atom in a static electric field. We describe the H atom by
</p>
<p>Bohr&rsquo;s atomic model. In a distance of the Bohr radius (a0 = 0.053 nm) to the nucleus
</p>
<p>(proton), an electron experiences the field strength

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35.2 Origin of Nonlinear Polarization 637
</p>
<p>A static external field polarizes an H atom. The center of the positive charge and the
</p>
<p>center of the negative charge do not coincide with each other. Therefore, the H atom
</p>
<p>represents an electric dipole. The dipole moment increases with the field strength. At
</p>
<p>large field strength, the dipole moment depends nonlinearly on the field strength. The
</p>
<p>nonlinearity is extremely large when the field strength is of the order of the internal
</p>
<p>field produced by the proton at the site of the electron.
</p>
<p>A strong high frequency field with a sinusoidal time dependence applied to a
</p>
<p>nonlinear medium leads to a time dependent polarization
</p>
<p>P(t) = ε0χ
(1) E(t)+ ε0χ
</p>
<p>(2)E2(t)+ . . . . (35.6)
</p>
<p>We describe the nonlinear polarization in the classical model of an atom (Sect. 4.8).
</p>
<p>Under the action of a strong electric field, an electron oscillates unharmonically&mdash;
</p>
<p>leading to a nonlinear dipole moment. Accordingly, the polarization of a medium
</p>
<p>depends nonlinearly on the amplitude of the electric field. The time-dependent polar-
</p>
<p>ization, which depends nonlinearly on the electric field, contains frequency compo-
</p>
<p>nents not only at the driving frequency but also at other frequencies. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>nonlinear polarization is the source of electromagnetic radiation at frequencies that
</p>
<p>differ from the driving frequency.
</p>
<p>Atoms, ions, or molecules in gases, liquids and solids show nonlinear polariza-
</p>
<p>tion. The strength of the nonlinearity strongly depends on the specific material. Espe-
</p>
<p>cially large nonlinear susceptibilities are known for a variety of crystals (e.g., KDP,
</p>
<p>LiNbO3).
</p>
<p>We will now discuss applications that are based on the nonlinear polarization.
</p>
<p>35.3 Optical Frequency Doubler
</p>
<p>A frequency doubler (Fig. 35.2a) converts radiation of frequency ν to radiation at
</p>
<p>the doubled frequency (2ν). A filter blocks the radiation of frequency ν that is not
</p>
<p>converted. The frequency doubling makes use of the quadratic term of the polariza-
</p>
<p>tion,
</p>
<p>P = ε0χ

</p>
<p>(2)E2(ω). (35.7)

<p>frequency 2ω. The additional term corresponds to a static polarization (optical recti-
</p>
<p>fication). In an elementary process of frequency doubling (Fig. 30.2b), two photons
</p>
<p>of the quantum energy hν are annihilated and a photon of energy 2hν is created.
</p>
<p>Examples
</p>
<p>&bull; A frequency doubler converts infrared radiation to green radiation. As nonlinear
</p>
<p>crystals, LiNbO3 or KDP are suitable: the conversion efficiency can reach 40%.
</p>
<p>&bull; In a titanium&ndash;sapphire laser, a frequency doubler located within the laser resonator
</p>
<p>produces frequency-doubled radiation in the violet and green (according to the

<p>tunability of the laser).
</p>
<p>&bull; Frequency doubling of green or blue radiation leads to UV radiation.

<p>35.4 Difference Frequency Generator
</p>
<p>In a difference frequency generator (Fig. 35.3a), two sinusoidal fields of different

<p>frequencies (ω1 andω2; withω1 &gt; ω2) produce a nonlinear polarization in a nonlinear
</p>

<p>that is the source of the field at the difference frequency. The polarization and, accord-
</p>
<p>ingly, the field at the difference frequency ω1 &minus; ω2 are proportional to the product
</p>
<p>of the amplitudes A1 and A2. In an elementary process of difference frequency gen-
</p>
<p>eration, a photon (energy hν1) is annihilated, a photon at the energy hν2 and another
</p>
<p>photon at the energy hν3 = hν1 &minus; hν2 are created (Fig. 35.3b).
</p>
<p>The frequency difference generation obeys the Manley-Rowe rule. A photon of the
</p>
<p>quantum energy hν1 can only produce one photon of energy hν3. This corresponds
</p>
<p>to the energy conservation law of the elementary process. Thus, the efficiency of
</p>
<p>conversion of radiation at frequency ν1 to radiation of frequency ν3 is
</p>
<p>ηdiff = ν3/ν1. (35.17)
</p>
<p>If the frequency ν3 is much smaller than ν1 (and ν2), only a small portion of the power
</p>
<p>of radiation at the frequency ν1 is converted to power of radiation at the difference
</p>
<p>frequency.
</p>
<p>Application. The superposition of two visible or near infrared laser fields of dif-
</p>
<p>ferent frequencies can lead to generation of far infrared radiation.
</p>
<p>35.5 Optical Parametric Oscillator
</p>
<p>An optical parametric oscillator (OPO) converts radiation of a pump frequency (νp)
</p>
<p>to tunable radiation at two other frequencies (ν1 and ν2). Radiation of one of the fre-
</p>
<p>quencies ν1 or ν2 (or of both frequencies) is stored in a resonator in order to produce
</p>
<p>a feedback to the nonlinear crystal (Fig. 35.4a). The OPO shows threshold behavior.
</p>
<p>Above a threshold amplitude of the pump field, optical parametric oscillation sets in.
</p>
<p>The oscillation frequency ν1 depends on the resonator. Changing the eigenfrequency
</p>
<p>of the resonator leads to a variation of ν2 and ν3.
</p>
<p>(Together with the change of the resonance frequency, phase matching of the
</p>
<p>fields of different frequencies is a necessary condition for operation of a parametric</p>

</p>
<p>tion of the nonlinear crystal, e.g., of a LiNbO3 crystal; changing the frequency of the
</p>
<p>signal wave then requires a rotation of the crystal. Another possibility is the change
</p>
<p>of the crystal temperature, suitable for KDP.)
</p>
<p>In the photon picture (Fig. 35.4b), the elementary process in the OPO crystal
</p>
<p>corresponds to the decay of a photon into two photons of smaller quantum energy.
</p>
<p>The energy conservation law holds,
</p>
<p>hνp = hν1 + hν2. (35.18)
</p>
<p>An optical parametric oscillator, pumped with radiation near 1 &micro;m, is suitable for
</p>
<p>generation of tunable infrared radiation with frequencies in the range from 1 THz
</p>
<p>to 15 THz; the threshold pump power of a parametric oscillator is of the order of
</p>
<p>1 MW/cm2 (for LiNbO3 as the nonlinear crystal).
</p>
<p>The notations&mdash;νp = pump frequency, ν1 = νs = signal frequency and
</p>
<p>ν2 = νi = idler frequency&mdash;have originally been introduced in the fields of high fre-
</p>
<p>quency technique and of microwave technique. &ldquo;Parametric&rdquo; means that the pump

<p>field modulates a parameter and that the parameter gives rise to a frequency con-
</p>

<p>The third-order polarization due to a monochromatic field causes two different
</p>
<p>effects, frequency tripling and a change of the refractive at the frequency ω.
</p>
<p>The first term is the source of an electric field at the frequency 3ν (Fig. 35.5a).
</p>
<p>Radiation of frequency ν is converted to radiation of frequency 3ν. In an elementary
</p>
<p>process, three photons of energy hν are annihilated and a photon of energy 3hν is
</p>
<p>created (Fig. 35.5b).</p>

<p>with E1 = A1 cosω1t , E2 = A2 cosω2t and E3 = A3 cosω3t , is responsible for the
</p>
<p>mixing process. The polarization P is the source of a field E4 = A4 cos ω4t . The
</p>
<p>nonlinear medium can be a crystal or a glass. The elementary process of the four-wave
</p>
<p>mixing (Fig. 35.7b) corresponds to the conversion of two photons (energy hν1 and
</p>
<p>hν2) to two other photons (energy hν3 and hν4). Four-wave mixing is a stimulated
</p>
<p>process. It occurs at strengths above appropriate threshold fields of E1 and E2.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 35.8 Four-wave mixing
</p>
<p>of a frequency comb
</p>
<p>Four-wave mixing has many applications (see books on nonlinear optics). Here,
</p>
<p>we discuss as an example the role of four-wave mixing for the optical frequency
</p>
<p>analyzer.
</p>
<p>Example four-wave mixing of radiation consisting of an optical frequency comb.
</p>
<p>In our earlier treatment of the optical spectrum analyzer, we have seen that the
</p>
<p>pulses emitted by a femtosecond laser are not exactly multiples of the round trip
</p>
<p>frequency fr of the radiation pulses in the laser, but that the frequencies are shifted
</p>
<p>by a frequency offset fo. The frequency of the nth line of the optical frequency comb
</p>
<p>is equal to
</p>
<p>fn = n fr + fo. (35.23)
</p>
<p>We now discuss how the frequencies fr and fo can be determined (Fig. 35.8). A
</p>
<p>frequency comb generated by a titanium&ndash;sapphire laser is strongly focused to a glass
</p>
<p>fiber (inner diameter &sim;1 &micro;m). In a four-wave mixing process, the frequency comb
</p>
<p>broadens and all lines show the same frequency shift fo. This follows from an analysis
</p>
<p>of the polarization. The term cosω1t cosω2t cosω3t of the polarization contains the
</p>
<p>angular frequency ω1 + ω2 &minus; ω3 and is the source of a field of frequency
</p>
<p>f4 = f1 + f2 &minus; f3 = n4 fr &minus; fo, (35.24)
</p>
<p>where n4 = n1 + n2 &minus; n3 is an integer. By the mixing of radiation of different fre-
</p>
<p>quencies f1, f2, and f3, the frequency comb becomes very broad. The optical fre-
</p>
<p>quency analyzer involves the following frequencies.
</p>
<p>&bull; fr = repetition rate of the femtosecond pulses = number of pulses per second,
</p>
<p>measured by counting the pulses.
</p>
<p>&bull; fo = offset frequency; measured by mixing of frequency-doubled radiation.
</p>
<p>&bull; 2 fn = 2n fr + 2 fo = frequencies of frequency-doubled radiation. The mixing of
</p>
<p>the frequency-doubled radiation with radiation generated by four-wave mixing
</p>
<p>provides the difference frequencies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35.7 Four-Wave Mixing and Optical Frequency Analyzer 643
</p>
<p>2 fn &minus; fm = (2n &minus; m) fr &minus; fo, (35.25)
</p>
<p>where n and m are integers. For 2n = m, the difference frequency is fo. By mea-
</p>
<p>suring different combinations of (2n &minus; m), also fr can be determined by a mixing
</p>
<p>experiment: a photodiode serves as nonlinear device, which produces microwaves
</p>
<p>at the difference frequencies.
</p>
<p>In an optical frequency analyzer, the frequency fo is kept constant. For this purpose,
</p>
<p>the laser resonator of the titanium&ndash;sapphire laser is stabilized: the distance between
</p>
<p>the resonator mirrors is piezoelectrically controlled. After starting a femtosecond
</p>
<p>titanium&ndash;sapphire laser and reaching stable operation, the offset frequency fo is kept
</p>
<p>constant
</p>
<p>35.8 Stimulated Raman Scattering
</p>
<p>An efficient way of converting monochromatic radiation into coherent radiation of
</p>
<p>another frequency is the stimulated Raman scattering.
</p>
<p>In a Raman scattering process (Fig. 35.9), the energy �ω1 of a photon is converted
</p>
<p>to energy �ω2 of another photon and internal excitation energy Eint of a medium.
</p>
<p>The Raman scattered light is incoherent. Above a threshold pump field, stimulated
</p>
<p>Raman scattering results in the generation of a coherent field. Internal excitations
</p>
<p>can be phonons in crystals, phonons in glasses, vibrational-rotational excitations, or
</p>
<p>rotational excitations in molecular gases.
</p>
<p>Example Stimulated Raman scattering of radiation of a CO2 laser at molecules (e.g.,
</p>
<p>CH3F molecules in a gas) can lead to coherent far infrared radiation; the internal
</p>
<p>excitation is a vibrational-rotational state in a molecular gas (Sect. 14.9).

10.7 Density of modes in free space
</p>
<p>We consider a propagating wave E = A exp[i(ωt &minus; kr)]. We apply periodic
boundary conditions: E(x + L , y + L , z + L) = E(x, y, z) for each value of t ; L is
the length of the periodicity interval assumed to be equal in all spatial directions. This
leads to the conditions: exp(ikx L) = 1; exp(iky L) = 1; exp(ikz L) = 1. It follows
that: kx = l&times;2π/L; ky = m&times;2π/L; kz = n&times;2π/L; k2 = (2π/L)2(l2 +m2 +n2),
with l,m, n = 0,&plusmn;1,&plusmn;2, . . .. We find, with ω = ck, that ω2 = (2πc/L)2(l2+m2+
n2). The mode density in k space is D(k) = (L3/π2)k2 and in ω space D&lowast;(ω) =
ω2 L3/(π2c3). With D&lowast;(ω)dω = D&lowast;(ν)dν, we obtain D&lowast;(ν) = (8πν2/c3)L3.

r &sim; 106 rth; the pump rate is about 106 times larger than the threshold pump

</p>
<p>(b) Because of the extremely long lifetime of the upper laser level with respect
to spontaneous emission, the oscillation builds up as soon as the population
difference exceeds (N2 &minus; N1)th. Stronger pumping then leads to generation
of laser radiation. By collisions of the CO2 molecules with each other, a
quasithermal distribution of the populations of the different rotational levels
of the excited state is maintained and the pump energy is converted to laser
radiation (and energy of relaxation).
</p>
<p>(c) We treat, for simplicity, the CO2 gas as an ideal gas. At 273 K and normal
pressure, an ideal gas (mole volume 22.4 l) contains 6 &times; 1023 molecules. This
corresponds to about 3 &times; 1025 m&minus;3. We use this number for CO2 at room
temperature and normal pressure (1 bar). At a pressure of 10 mbar, the density
of available CO2 molecules is 3 &times; 1022 m&minus;3. At room temperature, excited CO2
molecules are in different rotational states. About 1% of the molecules are in a
particular rotational state. Thus, about 3 &times; 1021 molecules per m3 are available
for laser transitions. Assuming that half of the molecules are in an excited
state we find that the density of molecules in a vibrational-rotational state is
1.5 &times; 1021 m&minus;3. This leads to α &sim; 8 &times; αth &sim; 1.4 m&minus;1 and to a single path gain
of G1 = exp(αL) = 4.
</p>
<p>(d) For a collision-broadened line, the gain cross section is σ21 = c2 A21/(8πν2)
g(ν). With increasing pressure g(ν) broadens and the cross section in the line
center, σ21(ν0) = c2 A21/(8πν2)&times;2/(πΔνc), is inversely proportional to the gas
pressure p. It follows that α(ν0) is independent of pressure above a pressure of
about 10 mbar. At this pressure, 2Δνc &sim; ΔνD, the gain coefficient we calculated
is the maximum gain coefficient for the TEA and the high-pressure CO2 laser.
</p>
<p>In a TEA laser, the pulse duration of the radiation is about 200 ns. It is much
larger than the duration (20 ns) of the electrical excitation pulse. During about 20
round trip transits of the radiation through the active medium, a fast redistribution
occurs for the population of the levels involved in a laser oscillation. If we assume
that about 1% of the excited molecules contribute to the laser oscillation, we find
the pulse energy Epulse = 0.3 J and the pulse power Epulse/tpulse &sim; 1 MW.</p>

<p>(b) The Nd3+:YVO4 laser produces a laser beam with a small angle of aperture.
Therefore, a column of a small diameter can be excited in titanium&ndash;sapphire
allowing generation of a narrow laser beam. Direct pumping with a semiconductor
laser beam, which has a large divergence, leads to excitation of the whole
titanium&ndash;sapphire crystal. This results in strong heating.

containing one k point is (2π/L)2. The density of k states is D̄2D(k) = kdk/(2π)L2.
The density of states in the energy space follows from the relation D̄2D(ǫ)dǫ =
