<p>Preface
</p>
<p>This is not your father&rsquo;s, your mother&rsquo;s, or your 
grandparent&rsquo;s Scanning Electron Microscopy and 
X-Ray Microanalysis (SEMXM). But that is not to 
say that there is no continuity or to deny a family 
resemblance. SEMXM4 is the fourth in the series 
of textbooks with this title, and continues a tradi-
tion that extends back to the &ldquo;zero-th edition&rdquo; in 
1975 published under the title, &ldquo;Practical Scanning 
Electron Microscopy&rdquo; (Plenum Press, New&nbsp;York). 
However, the latest edition differs sharply from 
its predecessors, which attempted an encyclope-
dic approach to the subject by providing extensive 
details on how the SEM and its associated devices 
actually work, for example, electron sources, lenses, 
electron detectors, X-ray spectrometers, and so on.
</p>
<p>In constructing this new edition, the authors have 
chosen a different approach. Modern SEMs and the 
associated X-ray spectrometry and crystallography 
measurement functions operate under such exten-
sive computer control and automation that it is 
actually difficult for the microscopist-microanalyst 
to interact with the instrument except within care-
fully prescribed boundaries. Much of the flexibility 
of parameter selection that early instruments pro-
vided has now been lost, as instrumental operation 
functions have been folded into software control. 
Thus, electron sources are merely turned &ldquo;on,&rdquo; with 
the computer control optimizing the operation, or 
for the thermally assisted field emission gun, the 
electron source may be permanently &ldquo;on.&rdquo; The user 
can certainly adjust the lenses to focus the image, 
but this focusing action often involves complex 
interactions of two or more lenses, which formerly 
would have required individual adjustment. More-
over, the nature of the SEM field has fundamentally 
changed. What was once a very specialized instru-
ment system that required a high level of training 
and knowledge on the part of the user has become 
much more of a routine tool. The SEM is now sim-
ply one of a considerable suite of instruments that 
can be employed to solve problems in the physical 
and biological sciences, in engineering, in technol-
ogy, in manufacturing and quality control, in fail-
ure analysis, in forensic science, and other fields.
</p>
<p>The authors also recognize the profound changes 
that have occurred in the manner in which peo-
ple obtain information. The units of SEMXM4, 
whether referred to as chapters or modules, are 
meant to be relatively self-contained. Our hope 
</p>
<p>is that a reader seeking specific information can 
select a topic from the list and obtain a good 
understanding of the topic from that module 
alone. While each topic is supported by informa-
tion in other modules, we acknowledge the like-
lihood that not all users of SEMXM4 will &ldquo;read 
it all.&rdquo; This approach inevitably leads to a degree 
of overlap and repetition since similar informa-
tion may appear in two or more places, and this is 
entirely intentional.
</p>
<p>In recognition of these fundamental changes, the 
authors have chosen to modify SEMXM4 exten-
sively to provide a guide on the actual use of the 
instrument without overwhelming the reader with 
the burden of details on the physics of the opera-
tion of the instrument and its various attachments. 
Our guiding principle is that the microscopist-
microanalyst must understand which parameters 
can be adjusted and what is an effective strategy to 
select those parameters to solve a particular prob-
lem. The modern SEM is an extraordinarily flex-
ible tool, capable of operating over a wide range 
of electron optical parameters and producing 
images from electron detectors with different sig-
nal characteristics. Those users who restrict them-
selves to a single set of operating parameters may 
be able to solve certain problems, but they may 
never know what they are missing by not explor-
ing the range of parameter space available to them. 
SEMXM4 seeks to provide sufficient understand-
ing of the technique for a user to become a com-
petent and efficient problem solver. That is not to 
say that there are only a few things to learn. To 
help the reader to approach the considerable body 
of knowledge needed to operate at a high degree 
of competency, a new feature of SEMXM-4 is the 
summary checklist provided for each of the major 
areas of operation: SEM imaging, elemental X-ray 
microanalysis, and backscatter-diffraction crystal-
lography.
</p>
<p>Readers familiar with earlier editions of SEMXM 
will notice the absence of the extensive material 
previously provided on specimen preparation. 
Proper specimen preparation is a critical step in 
solving most problems, but with the vast range of 
applications to materials of diverse character, the 
topic of specimen preparation itself has become 
the subject of entire books, often devoted to just 
one specialized area.</p>

</p>
<p>Throughout their history, the authors of the 
SEMXM textbooks have been closely associated 
as lecturers with the Lehigh University Summer 
Microscopy School. The opportunity to teach and 
interact with each year&rsquo;s students has provided a 
very useful experience in understanding the com-
munity of users of the technique and its evolution 
over time. We hope that these interactions have 
improved our written presentation of the subject 
as a benefit to newcomers as well as established 
practitioners.
</p>
<p>Finally, the author team sadly notes the passing in 
2015 of Professor Joseph I.&nbsp; Goldstein (University 
of Massachusetts, Amherst) who was the &ldquo;found-
ing father&rdquo; of the Lehigh University Summer 
Microscopy School in 1970, and who organized 
and contributed so extensively to the microscopy 
courses and to the SEMXM textbooks throughout 
the ensuing 45 years. Joe provided the stimulus to 
the production of SEMXM4 with his indefatigable 
spirit, and his technical contributions are embed-
ded in the X-ray microanalysis sections.

<p>Scanning Electron Microscopy and Associated 
Techniques: Overview
</p>
<p> Imaging Microscopic Features
</p>
<p>The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is an 
instrument that creates magnified images which 
reveal microscopic-scale information on the size, 
shape, composition, crystallography, and other 
physical and chemical properties of a specimen. 
The principle of the SEM was originally demon-
strated by Knoll (1935; Knoll and Theile 1939) 
with the first true SEM being developed by von 
Ardenne (1938). The modern commercial SEM 
emerged from extensive development in the 1950s 
and 1960s by Prof. Sir Charles Oatley and his 
many students at the University of Cambridge 
(Oatley 1972). The basic operating principle of 
the SEM involves the creation of a finely focused 
beam of energetic electrons by means of emission 
from an electron source. The energy of the elec-
trons in this beam, E
</p>
<p>0
, is typically selected in the 
</p>
<p>range from E
0
 = 0.1 to 30&nbsp; keV). After emission 
</p>
<p>from the source and acceleration to high energy, 
the electron beam is modified by apertures, mag-
netic and/or electrostatic lenses, and electromag-
netic coils which act to successively reduce the 
beam diameter and to scan the focused beam in a 
raster (x-y) pattern to place it sequentially at a 
series of closely spaced but discrete locations on 
the specimen. At each one of these discrete loca-
tions in the scan pattern, the interaction of the 
electron beam with the specimen produces two 
outgoing electron products: (1) backscattered 
electrons (BSEs), which are beam electrons that 
emerge from the specimen with a large fraction of 
their incident energy intact after experiencing 
scattering and deflection by the electric fields of 
the atoms in the sample; and (2) secondary elec-
trons (SEs), which are electrons that escape the 
specimen surface after beam electrons have 
ejected them from atoms in the sample. Even 
though the beam electrons are typically at high 
energy, these secondary electrons experience low 
kinetic energy transfer and subsequently escape 
the specimen surface with very low kinetic ener-
gies, in the range 0&ndash;50&nbsp;eV, with the majority below 
5&nbsp;eV in energy. At each beam location, these out-
going electron signals are measured using one or 
more electron detectors, usually an Everhart&ndash;
Thornley &ldquo;secondary electron&rdquo; detector (which is 
actually sensitive to both SEs and BSEs) and a 
&ldquo;dedicated backscattered electron detector&rdquo; that is 
insensitive to SEs. For each of these detectors, the 
signal measured at each individual raster scan 
</p>
<p>location on the sample is digitized and recorded 
into computer memory, and is subsequently used 
to determine the gray level at the corresponding 
X-Y location of a computer display screen, form-
ing a single picture element (or pixel). In a con-
ventional-vacuum SEM, the electron-optical 
column and the specimen chamber must operate 
under high vacuum conditions (&lt;10&minus;4 Pa) to min-
imize the unwanted scattering that beam elec-
trons as well as the BSEs and SEs would suffer by 
encountering atoms and molecules of atmo-
spheric gasses. Insulating specimens that would 
develop surface electrical charge because of 
impact of the beam electrons must be given a con-
ductive coating that is properly grounded to pro-
vide an electrical discharge path. In the variable 
pressure SEM (VPSEM), specimen chamber pres-
sures can range from 1&nbsp; Pa to 2000&nbsp; Pa (derived 
from atmospheric gas or a supplied gas such as 
water vapor), which provides automatic discharg-
ing of uncoated insulating specimens through the 
ionized gas atoms and free electrons generated by 
beam, BSE, and SE interactions. At the high end 
of this VPSEM pressure range with modest speci-
men cooling (2&ndash;5&nbsp;&deg;C), water can be maintained in 
a gas&ndash;liquid equilibrium, enabling direct exami-
nation of wet specimens.
</p>
<p>SEM electron-optical parameters can be optimized 
for different operational modes:
 1. A small beam diameter can be selected for high 
</p>
<p>spatial resolution imaging, with extremely fine 
scale detail revealed by possible imaging strate-
gies employing high beam energy, for example, 
. Fig.&nbsp;1a (E
</p>
<p>0
 = 15&nbsp;keV) and low beam energy, 
</p>
<p>. Fig.&nbsp;1b (E
0
 = 0.8&nbsp;keV), . Fig.&nbsp;1c (E
</p>
<p>0
 = 0.5&nbsp;keV), 
</p>
<p>and . Fig.&nbsp;1d (E
0
 = 0.3&nbsp;keV). However, a nega-
</p>
<p>tive consequence of choosing a small beam 
size is that the beam current is reduced as the 
inverse square of the beam diameter. Low beam 
current means that visibility is compromised 
for features that produce weak contrast.
</p>
<p> 2. A high beam current improves visibility of low 
contrast objects (e.g., . Fig.&nbsp;2). For any combi-
nation of beam current, pixel dwell time, and 
detector efficiency there is always a threshold 
contrast below which features of the speci-
men will not be visible. This threshold contrast 
depends on the relative size and shape of the 
feature of interest. The visibility of large objects 
and extended linear objects persists when 
small&nbsp;objects have dropped below the visibility </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>VIII
</p>
<p>threshold. This threshold can only be lowered 
by increasing beam current, pixel dwell time, 
and/or detector efficiency. Selecting higher 
beam current means a larger beam size, caus-
ing resolution to deteriorate. Thus, there is a 
dynamic contest between resolution and visibil-
ity leading to inevitable limitations on feature 
size and feature visibility that can be achieved.
</p>
<p> 3. The beam divergence angle can be minimized 
to increase the depth-of-field (e.g., . Fig.&nbsp;3). 
With optimized selection of aperture size and 
specimen-to-objective lens distance (work-
ing distance), it is generally possible to achieve 
small beam convergence angles and therefore 
effective focus along the beam axis that is at 
least equal to the horizontal width of the image.

</p>
<p>A negative consequence of using a small aper-
ture to reduce the convergence/divergence angle 
is a reduction in beam current.
</p>
<p>Vendor software supports collection, dynamic 
processing, and interpretation of SEM images, 
including extensive spatial measurements. Open 
source software such as ImageJ-Fiji, which is 
highlighted in this textbook, further extends these 
digital image processing capabilities and provides 
the user access to a large microscopy community 
effort that supports advanced image processing.
</p>
<p>General specimen property information that 
can be obtained from SEM images:
 1. Compositional microstructure (e.g., . Fig.&nbsp;4). 
</p>
<p>Compositional variations of 1 unit differ-
ence in average atomic number (Z) can be 
observed generally with BSE detection, with 
even greater sensitivity (ΔZ = 0.1) for low 
(Z = 6) and intermediate (Z = 30) atomic num-
bers. The lateral spatial resolution is generally 
</p>
<p>limited to approximately 10&ndash;100&nbsp;nm depend-
ing on the specimen composition and the 
beam energy selected.
</p>
<p> 2. Topography (shape) (e.g., . Fig.&nbsp;5). Topo-
graphic structure can be imaged with varia-
tions in&nbsp;local surface inclination as small as 
a few degrees. The edges of structures can 
be localized with a spatial resolution rang-
ing from the incident beam diameter (which 
can be 1&nbsp;nm or less, depending on the elec-
tron&nbsp;source) up to 10&nbsp;nm or greater, depend-
ing on the material and the geometric nature 
of the edge (vertical, rounded, tapered, re-
entrant, etc.).
</p>
<p> 3. Visualizing the third dimension (e.g., . Fig.&nbsp;6). 
Optimizing for a large depth-of-field permits 
visualizing the three-dimensional structure 
of a specimen. However, in conventional X-Y 
image presentation, the resulting image is a 
projection of the three dimensional informa-
tion onto a two dimensional plane, suffering

<p>spatial distortion due to foreshortening. The 
true three-dimensional nature of the speci-
men can be recovered by applying the tech-
niques of stereomicroscopy, which invokes 
the natural human visual process for stereo 
imaging by combining two independent views 
of the same area made with small angular dif-
ferences.
</p>
<p> 4. Other properties which can be accessed by 
SEM imaging: (1) crystal structure, including 
grain boundaries, crystal defects, and crystal 
deformation effects (e.g., . Fig.&nbsp;8); (2) mag-
netic microstructure, including magnetic 
domains and interfaces; (3) applied electri-
cal fields in engineered microstructures; (4) 
electron-stimulated optical emission (cath-
odoluminescence), which is sensitive to low 
energy electronic structure.
</p>
<p> Measuring the&nbsp;Elemental 
Composition
</p>
<p>The beam interaction with the specimen produces 
two types of X-ray photon emissions which com-
pose the X-ray spectrum: (1) characteristic X-rays, 
whose specific energies provide a fingerprint that 
is specific to each element, with the exception of H 
and He, which do not emit X-rays; and (2) con-
tinuum X-rays, which occur at all photon energies 
from the measurement threshold to E
</p>
<p>0
 and form a 
</p>
<p>background beneath the characteristic X-rays. 
This X-ray spectrum can be used to identify and 
quantify the specific elements (excepting H and 
He, which do not produce X-rays) present within 
the beam-excited interaction volume, which has 
dimensions ranging from approximately 100&nbsp; nm 
to 10&nbsp; μm depending on composition and beam 
energy, over a wide range of concentrations (C, 
expressed in mass fraction):
&ldquo;Major constituent&rdquo;: 0.1 &lt; C &le; 1
&ldquo;Minor constituent&rdquo;: 0.01 &le; C &le; 0.1
&ldquo;Trace constituent&rdquo;: C &lt; 0.01
</p>
<p>The X-ray spectrum is measured with the semi-
conductor energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer 
(EDS), which can detect photons from a threshold 
of approximately 40&nbsp;eV to E
</p>
<p>0
 (which can be as high 
</p>
<p>as 30&nbsp; keV). Vendor software supports collection 
and analysis of spectra, and these tools can be aug-
mented significantly with the open source software 
National Institute of Standards and Technology 
DTSA II for quantitative spectral processing and 
simulation, discussed in this textbook.
</p>
<p>Analytical software supports qualitative X-ray 
microanalysis which involves assigning the char-
acteristic peaks recognized in the spectrum to 
specific elements. Qualitative analysis presents 
significant challenges because of mutual peak 
interferences that can occur between certain

<p>combinations of elements, for example, Ti and 
Ba; S, Mo, and Pb; and many others, especially 
when the peaks of major constituents interfere 
with the peaks of minor or trace constituents. 
Operator knowledge of the physical rules govern-
ing X-ray generation and detection is needed to 
perform a careful review of software-generated 
peak identifications, and this careful review must 
always be performed to achieve a robust mea-
surement result.
</p>
<p>After a successful qualitative analysis has been 
performed, quantitative analysis can proceed. 
The characteristic intensity for each peak is auto-
matically determined by peak fitting procedures, 
such as the multiple linear least squares method. 
The intensity measured for each element is pro-
portional to the concentration of that element, 
but that intensity is also modified by all other ele-
ments present in the interaction volume through 
their influence on the electron scattering and 
retardation (&ldquo;atomic number&rdquo; matrix effect, Z), 
X-ray absorption within the specimen (&ldquo;absorp-
tion&rdquo; matrix effect, A), and X-ray generation 
induced by absorption of X-rays (&ldquo;secondary flu-
orescence&rdquo; matrix effects, F, induced by charac-
teristic X-rays and c, induced by continuum 
X-rays). The complex physics of these &ldquo;ZAFc&rdquo; 
matrix corrections has been rendered into algo-
rithms by a combined theoretical and empirical 
approach. The basis of quantitative electron-
excited X-ray microanalysis is the &ldquo;k-ratio proto-
col&rdquo;: measurement under identical conditions 
(beam energy, known electron dose, and spec-
trometer performance) of the characteristic 
intensities for all elements recognized in the 
unknown spectrum against a suite of standards 
containing those same elements, producing a set 
of k-ratios, where
</p>
<p>k I I=
Unknown Standard
</p>
<p>/  (1)
</p>
<p>for each element in the unknown. Standards are 
materials of known composition that are tested to 
be homogeneous at the microscopic scale, and 
preferably homogeneous at the nanoscale. 
Standards can be as simple as pure elements&mdash;e.g., 
C, Al, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au, etc.&mdash;but for 
those elements that are not stable in a vacuum 
(e.g., gaseous elements such as O) or which 
degrade during electron bombardment (e.g., S, P, 
and Ga), stable stoichiometric compounds can be 
used instead, e.g., MgO for O; FeS
</p>
<p>2
 for S; and GaP 
</p>
<p>for Ga and P.&nbsp; The most accurate analysis is per-
formed with standards measured on the same 
instrument as the unknown(s), ideally in the same 
measurement campaign, although archived 
</p>
<p>standard spectra can be effectively used if a quality 
measurement program is implemented to ensure 
the constancy of measurement conditions, includ-
ing spectrometer performance parameters. With 
such a standards-based measurement protocol and 
ZAFc matrix corrections, the accuracy of the anal-
ysis can be expressed as a relative deviation from 
expected value (RDEV):
</p>
<p>RDEV TrueMeasured True% %/( ) [ ]( )= &acute;- 100  
 
</p>
<p>(2)
</p>
<p>Based on extensive testing of homogeneous 
binary and multiple component compositions, 
the distribution of RDEV values for major con-
stituents is such that a range of &plusmn;5 % relative cap-
tures 95 % of all analyses. The use of stable, high 
integrated count spectra (&gt;1 million total counts 
from threshold to E
</p>
<p>0
) now possible with the sili-
</p>
<p>con drift detector EDS (SDD-EDS), enables this 
level of accuracy to be achieved for major and 
minor constituents even when severe peak inter-
ference occurs and there is also a large concen-
tration ratio, for example, a major constituent 
interfering with a minor constituent. Trace con-
stituents that do not suffer severe interference 
can be measured to limits of detection as low as 
C = 0.0002 (200 parts per million) with spectra 
containing &gt;10 million counts. For interference 
situations, much higher count spectra (&gt;100 
million counts) are required.
</p>
<p>An alternative &ldquo;standardless analysis&rdquo; protocol 
uses libraries of standard spectra (&ldquo;remote stan-
dards&rdquo;) measured on a different SEM platform 
with a similar EDS spectrometer, ideally over a 
wide range of beam energy and detector parame-
ters (resolution). These library spectra are then 
adjusted to the local measurement conditions 
through comparison of one or more key spectra 
(e.g., locally measured spectra of particular ele-
ments such as Si and Ni). Interpolation/extrapola-
tion is used to supply estimated spectral intensities 
for elements not present in or at a beam energy not 
represented in the library elemental suite. Testing 
of the standardless analysis method has shown 
that an RDEV range of &plusmn;25 % relative is needed to 
capture 95 % of all analyses.
</p>
<p>High throughput (&gt;100&nbsp;kHz) EDS enables col-
lection of X-ray intensity maps with gray scale rep-
resentation of different concentration levels (e.g., 
. Fig.&nbsp; 7a). Compositional mapping by spectrum 
imaging (SI) collects a full EDS spectrum at each 
pixel of an x-y array, and after applying the quanti-
tative analysis procedure at each pixel, images are 
created for each element where the gray (or color) 
level is assigned based on the measured concentra-
tion (e.g., . Fig.&nbsp;7b).

</p>
<p> Measuring the&nbsp;Crystal Structure
</p>
<p>An electron beam incident on a crystal can undergo 
electron channeling in a shallow near-surface layer 
which increases the initial beam penetration for 
certain orientations of the beam relative to the 
crystal planes. The additional penetration results in 
a slight reduction in the electron backscattering 
coefficient, which creates weak crystallographic 
contrast (a few percent) in SEM images by which 
differences in&nbsp; local crystallographic orientation 
can be directly observed: grain boundaries, defor-
mations bands, and so on (e.g., . Fig.&nbsp;8).
</p>
<p>The backscattered electrons exiting the speci-
men are subject to crystallographic diffraction 
effects, producing small modulations in the intensi-
ties scattered to different angles that are superim-
posed on the overall angular distribution that an 
amorphous target would produce. The resulting 
&ldquo;electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)&rdquo; pattern 
provides extensive information on the local orienta-
tion, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;8b for a crystal of hematite. 
EBSD pattern angular separations provide mea-
surements of the crystal plane spacing, while the 
overall EBSD pattern reveals symmetry elements. 
This crystallographic information combined with 
elemental analysis information obtained simultane-
ously from the same specimen region can be used to 
identify the crystal structure of an unknown.
</p>
<p> Dual-Beam Platforms: Combined 
Electron and&nbsp;Ion Beams
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;dual-beam&rdquo; instrument combines a fully func-
tional SEM with a focused ion beam (FIB), typi-
cally gallium or argon. This combination provides 
a flexible platform for in situ specimen modifica-
tion through precision ion beam milling and/or 
ion beam mediated material deposition with 
sequential or simultaneous electron beam tech-
nique characterization of the newly revealed 
specimen surfaces. Precision material removal 
enables detailed study of the third dimension of a 
specimen with nanoscale resolution along the 
depth axis. An example of ion beam milling of a 
directionally solidified Al-Cu is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;9, 
as imaged with the SEM column on the dual-
beam instrument. Additionally, ion-beam 
induced secondary electron emission provides 
scanning ion microscopy (SIM) imaging to com-
plement SEM imaging. For imaging certain speci-
men properties, such as crystallographic 
structure, SIM produces stronger contrast than 
SEM.&nbsp; There is also an important class of stand-
alone SIM instruments, such as the helium ion 
microscope (HIM), that are optimized for high 
resolution/high depth-of-field imaging perfor-
mance (e.g., the same area as viewed by HIM is 
also shown in . Fig.&nbsp;9).

<p> Modeling Electron and Ion 
Interactions
</p>
<p>An important component of modern Scanning 
Electron Microscopy and X-ray Microanalysis 
is modeling the interaction of beam electrons 
and ions with the atoms of the specimen and its 
environment. Such modeling supports image 
interpretation, X-ray microanalysis of challeng-
ing specimens, electron crystallography methods, 
and many other issues. Software tools for this pur-
pose, including Monte Carlo electron trajectory 
simulation, are discussed within the text. These 
tools are complemented by the extensive database 
of Electron-Solid Interactions (e.g., electron scat-
tering and ionization cross sections, secondary 
electron and backscattered electron coefficients, 
etc.), developed by Prof. David Joy, can be found 
in chapter 3 on SpringerLink: http://link.springer.

1.1  What Happens When the&nbsp;Beam 
</p>
<p>Electrons Encounter Specimen Atoms?
</p>
<p>By selecting the operating parameters of the SEM electron 
gun, lenses, and apertures, the microscopist controls the 
characteristics of the focused beam that reaches the speci-
men surface: energy (typically selected in the range 0.1&ndash;
30&nbsp;keV), diameter (0.5&nbsp;nm to 1&nbsp;μm or larger), beam current 
(1&nbsp; pA to 1&nbsp; μA), and convergence angle (semi-cone angle 
0.001&ndash;0.05 rad). In a conventional high vacuum SEM (typi-
cally with the column and specimen chamber pressures 
reduced below 10&minus;3 Pa), the residual atom density is so low 
that the beam electrons are statistically unlikely to encounter 
any atoms of the residual gas along the flight path from the 
electron source to the specimen, a distance of approximately 
25&nbsp;cm.
</p>
<p>kThe initial dimensional scale
</p>
<p>With a cold or thermal field emission gun on a high- 
performance SEM, the incident beam can be focused to 1&nbsp;nm 
in diameter, which means that for a target such as gold (atom 
diameter ~ 288&nbsp;pm), there are approximately 12 gold atoms in 
the first atomic layer of the solid within the area of the beam 
footprint at the surface.
</p>
<p>At the specimen surface the atom density changes 
abruptly to the very high density of the solid. The beam elec-
trons interact with the specimen atoms through a variety of 
physical processes collectively referred to as &ldquo;scattering 
events.&rdquo; The overall effects of these scattering events are to 
transfer energy to the specimen atoms from the beam elec-
trons, thus setting a limit on their travel within the solid, and 
to alter the direction of travel of the beam electrons away 
from the well-defined incident beam trajectory. These beam 
electron&ndash;specimen interactions produce the backscattered 
electrons (BSE), secondary electrons (SE), and X-rays that 
convey information about the specimen, such as coarse- and 
fine-scale topographic features, composition, crystal struc-
ture, and local electrical and magnetic fields. At the level 
needed to interpret SEM images and to perform electron-
excited X-ray microanalysis, the complex variety of scatter-
ing processes will be broadly classified into &ldquo;inelastic&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;elastic&rdquo; scattering.
</p>
<p>1.2  Inelastic Scattering (Energy Loss) 
Limits Beam Electron Travel 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Specimen
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inelastic&rdquo; scattering refers to a variety of physical processes 
that act to progressively reduce the energy of the beam elec-
tron by transferring that energy to the specimen atoms 
through interactions with tightly bound inner-shell atomic 
electrons and loosely bound valence electrons. These energy 
loss processes include ejection of weakly bound outer-shell 
</p>
<p>atomic electrons (binding energy of a few eV) to form sec-
ondary electrons; ejection of tightly bound inner shell atomic 
electrons (binding energy of hundreds to thousands of eV) 
which subsequently results in emission of characteristic 
X-rays; deceleration of the beam electron in the electrical 
field of the atoms producing an X-ray continuum over all 
energies from a few eV up to the beam&rsquo;s landing energy (E
</p>
<p>0
) 
</p>
<p>(bremsstrahlung or &ldquo;braking radiation&rdquo;); generation of waves 
in the free electron gas that permeates conducting metallic 
solids (plasmons); and heating of the specimen (phonon pro-
duction). While energy is lost in these inelastic scattering 
events, the beam electrons only deviate slightly from their 
current path. The energy loss due to inelastic scattering sets 
an eventual limit on how far the beam electron can travel in 
the specimen before it loses all of its energy and is absorbed 
by the specimen.
</p>
<p>To understand the specific limitations on the distance 
traveled in the specimen imposed by inelastic scattering, a 
mathematical description is needed of the rate of energy loss 
(incremental dE, measured in eV) with distance (incremen-
tal ds, measured in nm) traveled in the specimen. Although 
the various inelastic scattering energy loss processes are 
discrete and independent, Bethe (1930) was able to sum-
marize their collective effects into a &ldquo;continuous energy loss 
approximation&rdquo;:
</p>
<p>d d eV nmE s Z AE E J/ / . / ln . /( ) =&minus; ( ) ( )7 85 1 166ρ
 
</p>
<p>(1.1a)
</p>
<p>where E is the beam energy (keV), Z is the atomic number, ρ 
is the density (g/cm3), A is the atomic weight (g/mol), and J is 
the &ldquo;mean ionization potential&rdquo; (keV) given by
</p>
<p>J Z ZkeV x( )= +( )&minus; &minus;9 76 58 5 100 19 3. . .
 
</p>
<p>(1.1b)
</p>
<p>The Bethe expression is plotted for several elements (C, Al, 
Cu, Ag, Au) over the range of &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; SEM operat-
ing energies, 5&ndash;30&nbsp;keV in . Fig.&nbsp;1.1. This figure reveals that 
the rate of energy loss dE/ds increases as the electron 
energy decreases and increases with the atomic number of 
the target. An electron with a beam energy of 20&nbsp;keV loses 
energy at approximately 10&nbsp;eV/nm in Au, so that if this rate 
was constant, the total path traveled in the specimen would 
be approximately 20,000&nbsp;eV/(10&nbsp;eV/nm) = 2000&nbsp;nm = 2&nbsp;μm. 
A better estimate of this electron &ldquo;Bethe range&rdquo; can be 
made by explicitly considering the energy dependence of 
dE/ds through integration of the Bethe expression, Eq.&nbsp;1.1a, 
from the incident energy down to a lower cut-off energy 
(typically ~ 2&nbsp;keV due to limitations on the range of appli-
cability of the Bethe expression; see further discussion 
below). Based on this calculation, the Bethe range for the 
selection of elements is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;1.2. At a particular 
incident beam energy, the Bethe range decreases as the 
atomic number of the target increases, while for a particu-
lar target, the Bethe range increases as the incident beam 
energy increases.

<p>kNote the change of scale
</p>
<p>The Bethe range for Au with an incident beam energy of 
20&nbsp;keV is approximately 1200&nbsp;nm, a linear change in scale of 
a factor of 1200 over an incident beam diameter of 1&nbsp;nm. If 
the beam&ndash;specimen interactions were restricted to a cylin-
drical column with the circular beam entrance footprint as its 
</p>
<p>cross section and the Bethe range as its altitude, the volume 
of a cylinder 1&nbsp;nm in diameter and 1200&nbsp;nm deep would be 
approximately 940&nbsp; nm3, and the number of gold atoms it 
contained would be approximately 7.5 &times; 104, which can be 
compared to the incident beam footprint surface atom count 
of approximately 12.

1.3  Elastic Scattering: Beam Electrons 
</p>
<p>Change Direction of Flight
</p>
<p>Simultaneously with inelastic scattering, &ldquo;elastic scattering&rdquo; 
events occur when the beam electron is deflected by the elec-
trical field of an atom (the positive nuclear charge as partially 
shielded by the negative charge of the atom&rsquo;s orbital elec-
trons), causing the beam electron to deviate from its previous 
path onto a new trajectory, as illustrated schematically in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 1.3a. The probability of elastic scattering depends 
strongly on the nuclear charge (atomic number Z) and the 
energy of the electron, E (keV) and is expressed mathemati-
cally as a cross section, Q:

<p>where ϕ

 is a threshold elastic scattering angle, for example, 
</p>
<p>2&deg;. Despite the angular deviation, the beam electron energy is 
effectively unchanged in energy. While the average elastic 
scattering event causes an angular change of only a few 
degrees, deviations up to 180o are possible in a single elastic 
scattering event. Elastic scattering causes beam electrons to 
deviate out of the narrow angular range of incident trajecto-
ries defined by the convergence of the incident beam as con-
trolled by the electron optics.
</p>
<p>1.3.1  How Frequently Does Elastic  
Scattering Occur?
</p>
<p>The elastic scattering cross section, Eq.&nbsp; 1.2, can be used to 
estimate how far the beam electron must travel on average to 
experience an elastic scattering event, a distance called the 
&ldquo;mean free path,&rdquo; λ:

hundreds to thousands of times along a Bethe range of sev-
eral hundred to several thousand nanometers.

<p>1.4  Simulating the&nbsp;Effects of&nbsp;Elastic 
Scattering: Monte Carlo Calculations
</p>
<p>Inelastic scattering sets a limit on the total distance traveled 
by the beam electron. The Bethe range is an estimate of this 
distance and can be found by integrating the Bethe continu-
ous energy loss expression from the incident beam energy E
</p>
<p>0
 
</p>
<p>down to a low energy limit, for example, 2&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;Estimating 
the effects of elastic scattering on the beam electrons is much 
more complicated. Any individual elastic scattering event 
can result in a scattering angle within a broad range from a 
threshold of a fraction of a degree up to 180&deg;, with small scat-
tering angles much more likely than very large values and an 
average value typically in the range 5&ndash;10&deg;. Moreover, the 
electron scattered by the atom through an angle ϕ in 
. Fig.&nbsp;1.3a at point P1 can actually follow any path along the 
surface of the three-dimensional scattering cone shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;1.3b and can land anywhere in the circumference of 
the base of the scattering cone (i.e., the azimuthal angle in 
the base of the cone ranges from 0 to 360&deg; with equal proba-
bility), resulting in a three-dimensional path. The length of 
the trajectory along the surface of the scattering cone 
depends on the frequency of elastic events with distance 
traveled and can be estimated from Eq.&nbsp; 1.3a for the elastic 
scattering mean free path, λ
</p>
<p>elastic
. The next elastic scattering 
</p>
<p>event P2 causes the electron to deviate in a new direction, as 
</p>
<p>shown in . Fig.&nbsp;1.3c, creating an increasingly complex path. 
Because of the random component of scattering at each of 
many steps, this complex behavior cannot be adequately 
described by an algebraic expression like the Bethe continu-
ous energy loss equation. Instead, a stepwise simulation of 
the electron's behavior must be constructed that incorpo-
rates inelastic and elastic scattering. Several simplifications 
are introduced to create a practical &ldquo;Monte Carlo electron 
trajectory simulation&rdquo;:
 1. All of the angular deviation of the beam electron is ascribed 
</p>
<p>to elastic scattering. A mathematical model for elastic 
scattering is applied that utilizes a random number (hence 
the name &ldquo;Monte Carlo&rdquo; from the supposed randomness of 
gambling) to select a properly weighted value of the elastic 
scattering angle out of the possible range (from a threshold 
value of approximately 1&deg; to a maximum of 180&deg;). A second 
random number is used to select the azimuthal angle in the 
base of the scattering cone in . Fig.&nbsp;1.1c.
</p>
<p> 2. The distance between elastic scattering events, s, which 
lies on the surface of the scattering cone in . Fig.&nbsp;1.3b, is 
calculated from the elastic mean free path, Eq.&nbsp;1.3b.
</p>
<p> 3. Inelastic scattering is calculated with the Bethe 
continuous energy loss expression, Eq.&nbsp;1.1b. The specific 
energy loss, ΔE, along the path, s, in the surface of the 
scattering cone, . Fig.&nbsp;1.3b, is calculated with the Bethe 
continuous energy loss expression: ΔE = (dE/ds)*s

Given a specific set of these parameters, the Monte Carlo elec-
tron trajectory simulation utilizes geometrical expressions to 
calculate the successive series of locations P1, P2, P3, etc., suc-
cessively determining the coordinate locations (x, y, z) that the 
energetic electron follows within the solid. At each location P, 
the newly depreciated energy of the electron is known, and after 
the next elastic scattering angle is calculated, the new velocity 
vector components v
</p>
<p>x
, v
</p>
<p>y
, v
</p>
<p>z
 are determined to transport the 
</p>
<p>electron to the next location. A trajectory ends when either the 
electron energy falls below a threshold of interest (e.g., 1&nbsp;keV), 
or else the path takes it outside the geometric bounds of the 
specimen, which is determined by comparing the current loca-
tion (x, y, z) with the specimen boundaries. The capability of 
simulating electron beam interactions in specimens with com-
plex geometrical shapes is one of the major strengths of the 
Monte Carlo electron trajectory simulation method.
</p>
<p>Monte Carlo electron trajectory simulation can pro-
vide visual depictions as well as numerical results of the 
beam&ndash;specimen interaction, creating a powerful instructional 
tool for studying this complex phenomenon. Several power-
ful Monte Carlo simulations appropriate for SEM and X-ray 
microanalysis applications are available as free resources:
CASINO [7    http://www.gel.usherbrooke.ca/casino/What.html]
Joy Monte Carlo [7    http://web.utk.edu/~srcutk/htm/

</p>
<p>epq/dtsa2/index.html]
</p>
<p>While the static images of Monte Carlo simulations pre-
sented below are useful instructional aids, readers are 
encouraged to perform their own simulations to become 
familiar with this powerful tool, which in more elaborate 
implementations is an important aid in understanding criti-
cal aspects of SEM imaging.
</p>
<p>1.4.1  What Do Individual Monte Carlo 
Trajectories Look Like?
</p>
<p>Perform a Monte Carlo simulation (CASINO simulation) for 
copper with a beam energy of 20&nbsp;keV and a tilt of 0&deg; (beam 
perpendicular to the surface) for a small number of trajecto-
ries, for example, 25. . Figure&nbsp;1.5a, b show two simulations of 
25 trajectories each. The trajectories are actually determined 
in three dimensions (x-y-z, where x-y defines the surface 
plane and z is perpendicular to the surface) but for plotting 
are rendered in two dimensions (x-z), with the third 
</p>
<p>dimension y projected onto the x-z plane. (An example of the 
true three-dimensional trajectories, simulated with the Joy 
Monte Carlo, is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;1.6, in which a small number 
of trajectories (to minimize overlap) have been rendered as 
an anaglyph stereo representation with the convention left 
eye = red filter. Inspection of this simulation shows the y 
motion of the electrons in and out of the x-z plane.) The sto-
chastic nature of the interaction imposed by the nature of 
elastic scattering is readily apparent in the great variation 
among the individual trajectories seen in . Fig.&nbsp; 1.5a, b. It 
quickly becomes clear that individual beam electrons follow a 
huge range of paths and simulating a small number of trajec-
tories does not provide an adequate view of the electron beam 
specimen interaction.
</p>
<p>1.4.2  Monte Carlo Simulation To&nbsp;Visualize 
the&nbsp;Electron Interaction Volume
</p>
<p>To capture a reasonable picture representation of the electron 
interaction volume, which is the region of the specimen in 
which the beam electrons travel and deposit energy, it is nec-
essary to calculate many more trajectories. . Figure&nbsp; 1.5c 
shows the simulation for copper, E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp; keV at 0&deg; tilt 
</p>
<p>extended to 500 trajectories, which reveals the full extent of 
the electron interaction volume. Beyond a few hundred tra-
jectories, superimposing the three-dimensional trajectories 
to create a two-dimensional representation reaches dimin-
ishing returns due to overlap of the plotted lines. While sim-
ulating 500 trajectories provides a reasonable qualitative 
view of the electron interaction volume, Monte Carlo calcu-
lations of numerical properties of the interaction volume and 
related processes, such as electron backscattering (discussed 
in the backscattered electron module), are subject to statisti-
cally predictable variations because of the use of random 
numbers to select the elastic scattering parameters. Variance 
in repeated simulations of the same starting conditions is 
related to the number of trajectories and can be described 
with the properties of the Gaussian (normal) distribution. 
Thus the precision, p, of the calculation of a parameter of the 
interaction is related to the total number of simulated trajec-
tories, n, and the fraction, f, of those trajectories that produce 
the effect of interest (e.g., backscattering):

<p>1.4.3  Using the&nbsp;Monte Carlo Electron 
Trajectory Simulation to&nbsp;Study 
the&nbsp;Interaction Volume
</p>
<p> What Are the&nbsp;Main Features of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Beam 
Electron Interaction Volume?
</p>
<p>In . Fig.&nbsp;1.5c, the beam electron interaction volume is seen to 
be a very complex structure with dimensions extending over 
hundreds to thousands of nanometers from the beam impact 
point, depending on target material and the beam energy. At 
0&deg; tilt, the interaction volume is rotationally symmetric 
around the beam. While the electron trajectories provide a 
strong visual representation of the interaction volume, more 
informative numerical information is needed. The Monte 
Carlo simulation can provide detailed information on many 
aspects of the electron beam&ndash;specimen interaction. The 
color-encoding of the energy deposited along each trajectory, 
as implemented in the Joy Monte Carlo shown in . Fig.&nbsp;1.11, 
creates a view that reveals the general three-dimensional 
complexity of energy deposition within the interaction vol-
ume. The CASINO Monte Carlo provides an even more 
detailed view of energy deposition, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 1.7. 
The energy deposition per unit volume is greatest just under 
the beam impact location and rapidly falls off as the periph-
ery of the interaction volume is approached. This calculation 
reveals that a small cylindrical volume under the beam 
impact point, shown in more detail in . Fig.&nbsp; 1.7b, receives 
half of the total energy deposited by the beam in the speci-
men (that is, the volume within the 50% contour), with the 
</p>
<p>balance of the energy deposited in a strongly non-linear fash-
ion in the much larger portion of the interaction volume.
</p>
<p> How Does the&nbsp;Interaction Volume Change 
with&nbsp;Composition?
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;1.8 shows the interaction volume in various targets, 
C, Si, Cu, Ag, and Au, at fixed beam energy, E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV, and 
</p>
<p>0&deg; tilt. As the atomic number of the target increases, the lin-
ear dimensions of the interaction volume decrease. The 
form also changes from pear-shaped with a dense conical 
region below the beam impact for low atomic number tar-
gets to a more hemispherical shape for high atomic number 
targets.
</p>
<p>kNote the dramatic change of scale
</p>
<p>Approximately 12 gold atoms were encountered within the 
footprint of a 1-nm diameter at the surface. Without consid-
ering the effects of elastic scattering, the Bethe range for Au 
at an incident beam energy of 20&nbsp;keV limited the penetra-
tion of the beam to approximately 1200&nbsp;nm and a cylindri-
cal volume of approximately 940&nbsp; nm3, containing 
approximately 5.6 &times; 104&nbsp;Au atoms. The effect of elastic scat-
tering is to create a three-dimensional hemispherical inter-
action volume with a radius of approximately 600&nbsp;nm and a 
volume of 4.5 &times; 108&nbsp;nm3, containing 2.7 &times; 1010&nbsp;Au atoms, an 
increase of nine orders-of-magnitude over the number of 
atoms encountered in the initial beam footprint on the 
surface.
</p>
<p> How Does the&nbsp;Interaction Volume Change 
with&nbsp;Incident Beam Energy?
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;1.9 shows the interaction volume for copper at 0&deg; tilt 
over a range of incident beam energy from 5 to 30&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;The 
shape of the interaction volume is relatively independent of 
beam energy, but the size increases rapidly as the incident 
beam energy increases.
</p>
<p> How Does the&nbsp;Interaction Volume Change 
with&nbsp;Specimen Tilt?
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;1.10 shows the interaction volume for copper at an 
incident beam energy of 20&nbsp;keV and a series of tilt angles. As 
the tilt angle increases so that the beam approaches the surface 
at a progressively more shallow angle, the shape of the interac-
tion volume changes significantly. At 0&deg; tilt, the interaction 
volume is rotationally symmetric around the beam, but as the 
tilt angle increases the interaction volume becomes asymmet-
ric, with the dense portion of the distribution shifting progres-
sively away from the beam impact point. The maximum 
penetration of the beam is reduced as the tilt angle increases.

<p>1.5  A Range Equation To&nbsp;Estimate the&nbsp;Size 
of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Interaction Volume
</p>
<p>While the Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool to depict 
the complexity of the electron beam specimen interactions, it 
is often useful to have a simple estimate of the size. The Bethe 
range gives the maximum distance the beam electron can 
travel in the specimen, but this distance is measured along 
the complex trajectory that develops because of elastic scat-
tering. Kanaya and Okayama (1972) developed a range equa-
tion that considered both inelastic and elastic scattering to 
give an estimate of the interaction volume as the radius of a 
hemisphere centered on the beam impact point that con-
tained at least 95% of the trajectories:

the interaction volume in . Fig.&nbsp;1.11 and is plotted graphi-
cally in . Fig.&nbsp;1.12. It is, of course, simplistic to use a single 
numerical value of the range to describe such a complex phe-
nomenon as the electron interaction volume with its varying 
contours of energy deposition, and thus the range equation 
</p>
<p>should only be considered as a &ldquo;gray&rdquo; number useful for esti-
mation purposes. Nevertheless, the Kanaya&ndash;Okayama range 
is useful as a means to provide scaling to describe the spatial 
distributions of the signals produced within the interaction 
volume: secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, and 
X-rays.

<p>2.1  Origin
</p>
<p>Close inspection of the trajectories in the Monte Carlo simu-
lation of a flat, bulk target of copper at 0&deg; tilt shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 2.1 reveals that a significant fraction of the incident 
beam electrons undergo sufficient scattering events to com-
pletely reverse their initial direction of travel into the speci-
men, causing these electrons to return to the entrance surface 
and exit the specimen. These beam electrons that escape 
from the specimen are referred to as &ldquo;backscattered elec-
trons&rdquo; (BSE) and constitute an important SEM imaging sig-
nal rich in information on specimen characteristics. The BSE 
signal can convey information on the specimen composition, 
topography, mass thickness, and crystallography. This mod-
ule describes the properties of backscattered electrons and 
how those properties are modified by specimen characteris-
tics to produce useful information in SEM images.
</p>
<p>2.1.1  The Numerical Measure of 
Backscattered Electrons
</p>
<p>Backscattered electrons are quantified with the &ldquo;backscat-
tered electron coefficient,&rdquo; η, defined as
</p>
<p>η =N N
BSE B
/
</p>
<p> 
(2.1)
</p>
<p>where N
B
 is the number of beam electrons that enter the 
</p>
<p>specimen and N
BSE
</p>
<p> is the number of those electrons that sub-
sequently emerge as backscattered electrons.
</p>
<p>2.2  Critical Properties of&nbsp;Backscattered 
Electrons
</p>
<p>2.2.1  BSE Response to&nbsp;Specimen 
Composition (η vs. Atomic Number, Z)
</p>
<p>Use the CASINO Monte Carlo simulation software, which 
reports η in the output, to examine the dependence of electron 
backscattering on the atomic number of the specimen.
</p>
<p>Simulate at least 10,000 trajectories at an incident energy 
of E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV and a surface tilt of 0&deg; (i.e., the beam is perpen-
</p>
<p>dicular to the surface). Note that statistical variations will be 
observed in the calculation of η due to the different selections 
of the random numbers used in each simulation. Repetitions 
of this calculation will give a distribution of results, with a 
precision p = (η N)1/2/η N, so that for N = 10,000 trajectories 
and η ~ 0.15 (Si), p is expected to be 2.5 %. . Figure&nbsp;2.2 shows 
the simulation of 500 trajectories in carbon, silicon, copper, 
and gold with an incident energy of E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV and a surface 
</p>
<p>tilt of 0&deg;, showing qualitatively the increase in the number of 
backscattered electrons with atomic number.
</p>
<p>Detailed experimental measurements of the backscattered 
electron coefficient as a function of the atomic number, Z, in 
highly polished, flat pure element targets confirm a generally 
monotonic increase in η with increasing Z, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;2.3a, where the classic measurements made by Heinrich 
(1966) at a beam energy of 20&nbsp;keV are plotted. The slope of η 
vs. Z is highest for low atomic number targets up to approxi-
mately Z =14 (Si). As Z continues to increase into the range of

<p>the transition elements, e.g., Z = 26 (Fe), the slope progressively 
decreases until at very high Z, e.g., the region around Z = 79 
(Au), the slope becomes so shallow that there is very little 
change in η between adjacent elements. Plotted in addition to 
the experimental measurements in . Fig.&nbsp;2.3a is a mathemati-
cal fit to the 20&nbsp;keV data developed by Reuter (1972):

</p>
<p>(2.2)
</p>
<p>This fit provides a convenient estimate of η for those elements 
for which direct measurements do not exist.
</p>
<p>Experimental measurements (Heinrich 1966) have shown 
that the backscattered electron coefficient of a mixture of 
atoms that is homogeneous on the atomic scale, such as a 
stoichiometric compound, a glass, or certain metallic alloys, 
can be accurately predicted from the mass concentrations of 
the elemental constituents and the values of η for those pure 
elements:
</p>
<p>η η
mixture
</p>
<p>=Σ
i i
C
</p>
<p> 
(2.3)
</p>
<p>where C is the mass (weight) fraction and i is an index that 
denotes all of the elements involved.
</p>
<p>When measurements of η vs. Z are made at different 
beam energies, combining the experimental measurements 
of Heinrich and of Bishop in . Fig.&nbsp;2.3b, little dependence on 
the beam energy is found from 5 to 49&nbsp;keV, with all of the 
measurements clustering relatively closely to the curve for 
the 20&nbsp;keV data shown in . Fig.&nbsp;2.3a. This result is perhaps 
surprising in view of the strong dependence of the dimen-
sions of the interaction volume on the incident beam energy. 
The weak dependence of η upon E
</p>
<p>0
 despite the strong depen-
</p>
<p>dence of the beam penetration upon E
0
 can be understood as 
</p>
<p>a near balance between the increased energy available at 
higher E
</p>
<p>0
, the lower rate of loss, dE/ds, with higher E
</p>
<p>0
, and 
</p>
<p>the increased penetration. Thus, although a beam electron 
may penetrate more deeply at high E

tron at a lower incidence energy. Thus, a higher incidence 
energy electron, despite penetrating deeper in the specimen, 
retains more energy and can continue to scatter and progress 
through the target to escape.

<p> SEM Image Contrast with&nbsp;BSE: &ldquo;Atomic

<p>Whenever a signal that can be measured in the SEM, such as 
backscattered electrons, follows a predictable response to a

<p>The monotonic behavior of η vs. Z establishes the physical 
basis for &ldquo;atomic number contrast&rdquo; (also known as 
&ldquo;Z-contrast&rdquo; and &ldquo;compositional contrast&rdquo;). When an SEM 
BSE image is acquired from a flat specimen (i.e., no topogra-
phy is present, at least on a scale no greater than about 5 % of 
the Kanaya&ndash;Okayama range for the particular material com-
position and incident beam energy), then local differences in 
composition can be observed as differences in the BSE inten-
sity, which can be used to construct a meaningful gray-scale 
SEM image. The compositionally-different objects must have 
dimensions that are at least as large as the Kanaya-Okayama 
range for each distinct material so that a BSE signal charac-
teristic of the particular composition can be measured over at 
least the center portion of the object. The BSE signal at beam 
locations on the edge of the object may be affected by pene-
tration into the neighboring material(s).

<p>. Figure&nbsp; 2.7 shows the results of similar Monte Carlo 
simulations for various elements as a function of surface 
inclination. As the surface tilt increases, η increases for all 
elements, converging toward unity at high tilt and grazing 
incidence for the incident beam.
</p>
<p> SEM Image Contrast: &ldquo;BSE Topographic 
Contrast&mdash;Number Effects&rdquo;
</p>
<p>This regular behavior of η vs. θ provides the basis for a 
contrast mechanism by which differences in the relative 
numbers of backscattered electrons depend on differences 
in the local surface inclination, which reveals the surface 
</p>
<p>topography. . Figure&nbsp; 2.8a shows an example of a pure 
material (polycrystalline silver) with grain faces inclined 
at various angles. The higher the inclination of the local 
surface to the incident beam, the higher will be the BSE 
signal, so that highly inclined surfaces appear bright, while 
dark surfaces are those nearly perpendicular to the beam. 
This image was prepared with a backscattered electron 
detector (discussed in the Electron Optics&mdash;Detectors 
module), which has a very large solid angle, so that back-
scattered electrons are collected with high efficiency 
regardless of the direction that they travel after leaving the  
specimen.

<p>2.2.3  Angular Distribution of&nbsp;Backscattering
</p>
<p> Beam Incident Perpendicular to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Specimen 
Surface (0&deg; Tilt)
</p>
<p>For a flat, bulk target, backscattered electrons emerge 
through the surface along a wide range of possible angular 
paths measured relative to the surface normal. When the 
incident beam is perpendicular to the specimen surface (0&deg; 
tilt), experimental measurements and Monte Carlo simula-
tions show that the angular distribution of the trajectories is 
such that the fraction along any given angle of emission is 
proportional to the cosine of that angle of emission, φ, 
between the electron trajectory and the surface normal, as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;2.9a:
</p>
<p>η ϕ ϕ( ) ( )~cos
 
</p>
<p>(2.6)
</p>
<p>Thus, the largest number of BSEs follow a path parallel to the 
surface normal (φ =0&deg;, cosine = 1), while virtually no BSEs 
exit along a trajectory nearly parallel to the surface (φ =90&deg;, 
cosine = 0). The angular distribution seen in . Fig.&nbsp;2.8a is also 
rotationally symmetric around the beam: the same cosine 
shape would be found in any section through the distribution 
in any plane perpendicular to surface containing the beam 
vector and surface normal.
</p>
<p> Beam Incident at an&nbsp;Acute Angle 
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Specimen Surface (Specimen  
Tilt &gt; 0&deg;)
</p>
<p>When a flat, bulk target is tilted so that the beam is incident at 
an acute angle to the surface, the angular distribution of back-
scattered electrons changes from the rotationally symmetric 
cosine function of . Fig.&nbsp;2.9a to the asymmetric distribution

<p>seen in . Fig.&nbsp;2.9b, with this distribution measured for a tilt of 
60&deg; (angle of incidence = 30&deg;). The angular distribution is 
peaked in the forward direction away from the incident beam 
direction, with the maximum BSE emission occurring at an 
angle above the surface close to the value of the angle of inci-
dence above the surface of the beam. This angular asymmetry 
develops slowly for tilt angles up to approximately 30&deg;, but the 
asymmetry becomes increasingly pronounced with further 
increases in the specimen tilt. Moreover, the rotational sym-
metry of the 0&deg; tilt case is also progressively lost with increas-
ing tilt, with the asymmetric distribution seen in . Fig.&nbsp;2.9b 
becoming much narrower in the direction out of the plotting 
plane. See 7 Chapter 29 for effects of crystal structure on 
backscattering angular distribution.
</p>
<p> SEM Image Contrast: &ldquo;BSE Topographic 
Contrast&mdash;Trajectory Effects&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The overall effects of specimen tilt are to increase the number 
of backscattered electrons and to create directionality in the 
backscattered electron emission, and both effects become 
increasingly stronger as the tilt increases. The &ldquo;trajectory 
effects&rdquo; create a very strong component of topographic con-
trast when viewed with a backscattered electron detector that 
has limited size and is placed preferentially on one side of the 
specimen. . Figure&nbsp;2.8b shows the same area as . Fig.&nbsp;2.8a 
imaged with a small solid angle detector, located at the top 
center of the image. Very strong contrast is created between 
faces tilted toward the detector, i.e., facing upward, and those 
tilted away, i.e., facing downward. These effects will be dis-
cussed in detail in the Image Interpretation module.
</p>
<p>2.2.4  Spatial Distribution of&nbsp;Backscattering
</p>
<p>Model a small number of trajectories (~25) so that the indi-
vidual trajectories can be distinguished; e.g., for a copper target 
with an incident beam energy of 20&nbsp;keV and 0&deg; tilt, as seen in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 2.10 (Note: because of the random number sampling, 
repeated simulations will differ from each other and will be dif-
ferent from the printed example.) By following a number of 
trajectories from the point of incidence to the point of escape 
through the surface as backscattered electrons, it can be seen 
that the trajectories of beam electrons that eventually emerge 
as BSEs typically traverse the specimen both laterally and in 
depth.
</p>
<p> Depth Distribution of&nbsp;Backscattering
</p>
<p>By performing detailed Monte Carlo simulations for many 
thousands of trajectories and recording for each trajectory 
the maximum depth of penetration into the specimen before 
the electron eventually escaped as a BSE, we can determine 
the contribution to the overall backscatter coefficient as a 
function of the depth of penetration, as shown for a series of 
elements in . Fig.&nbsp;2.11a. To compare the different elements, 
the horizontal axis of the plot is the depth normalized by the 
Kanaya&ndash;Okayama range for each element. From the depth 
distribution data in . Fig.&nbsp;2.11a, the cumulative backscatter-
ing coefficient as a function of depth can be calculated, and as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;2.11b, this distribution follows an S-shaped 
curve. To capture 90 % of the total backscattering, which cor-
responds to the region where the slope of the plot is rapidly 
decreasing, the backscattered electrons are found to travel a

<p>beam energy leads to a strong dependence of the sampling 
depth of backscattered electrons, as shown in the depth dis-
tributions of backscattered electrons for copper over a wide 
energy range in . Fig.&nbsp;2.12. The substantial sampling depth 
of backscattered electrons combined with the strong depen-
dence of the electron range on beam energy provides a useful 
tool for the microscopist. By comparing a series of images of 
a given area as a function of beam energy, subsurface details 
can be recognized. An example is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;2.13 for an 
engineered semiconductor electronic device with three- 
dimensional layered features, where a systematic increase in 
the beam energy reveals progressively deeper structures.
</p>
<p> Radial Distribution of&nbsp;Backscattered 
Electrons
</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo simulation can record the x-y location at 
which a backscattered electron exits through the surface 
plane, and this information can be used to calculate the 
radial distribution of backscattering relative to the beam 
impact location. The cumulative radial distribution is shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;2.14 for a series of elements, as normalized by the 
Kanaya&ndash;Okayama range for each element, and an S-shaped 
curve is observed. . Table&nbsp;2.3 gives the fraction of the range 
necessary to capture 90 % of the total backscattering. The 
radial distribution is steepest for high atomic number ele-
ments, which scatter strongly compared to weakly scattering 
low atomic number elements. However, even for strongly 
scattering elements, the backscattered electrons emerge over 
a significant fraction of the range. This characteristic impacts 
the spatial resolution that can be obtained with backscat-
tered electron images. An example is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;2.15 for 
an interface between an aluminum-rich phase and a copper- 
rich phase (CuAl
</p>
<p>2
) in directionally solidified aluminum-

<p>2.2.5  Energy Distribution of&nbsp;Backscattered 
Electrons
</p>
<p>As a beam electron travels in the specimen, inelastic scatter-
ing progressively diminishes the energy. When the trajectory 
of a beam electron intersects a specimen surface so that back-
scattering occurs, the backscattered electron will have lost a 
portion of the initial beam energy, E
</p>
<p>0
, with the amount lost 
</p>
<p>depending on the length of the path within the specimen. 
The Monte Carlo simulation can record the exit energy of 
each backscattered electron, and from this data the energy 
distribution of BSE can be calculated, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;2.16a. 
The energy distribution is seen to extend from the incident 
beam energy down to zero energy. The energy distribution is 
sharply peaked at high fractional energy for a strong elastic 
scattering material such as gold, but the energy distribution 
is much broader and flatter for a weak elastic scattering mate-
rial such as carbon. The backscattered electron energy spec-
tra of . Fig.&nbsp; 2.16a can be used to calculate the cumulative 
backscattering distribution as a function of the fractional 
energy retained, E/E
</p>
<p>0
, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 2.16b. It is worth 
</p>
<p>noting that even for weakly scattering carbon, more than half 
of the backscattered electrons retain at least half of the inci-
dent beam energy. The retained energy is a critical property 
that impacts the design of detectors for backscattered 
electrons.
</p>
<p>2.3  Summary
</p>
<p>Backscattered electrons form an important imaging signal 
for the SEM.&nbsp;A general understanding of the major proper-
ties of BSE provides the basis for interpreting images:
 1.  η vs. Z (atomic number)
 2.  η vs. θ (specimen tilt)
 3.  η(θ) vs. φ (emission angle relative to surface normal)
 4.  η vs. sampling depth
 5.  η vs. radial distance from beam
 6.  η(E) vs. Z, energy distribution of BSE (. Fig.&nbsp;2.16)

<p>3.1  Origin
</p>
<p>Secondary electrons (SE) are created when inelastic scatter-
ing of the beam electrons ejects weakly bound valence elec-
trons (in the case of ionically or covalently bonded materials) 
or conduction band electrons (in the case of metals), which 
have binding energies of ~ 1&ndash;15&nbsp; eV to the parent atom(s). 
Secondary electrons are quantified by the parameter δ, which 
is the ratio of secondary electrons emitted from the speci-
men, N
</p>
<p>SE
, to the number of incident beam (primary) elec-
</p>
<p>trons, N
B
:
</p>
<p>d=N / N
SE B  
</p>
<p>(3.1)
</p>
<p>3.2  Energy Distribution
</p>
<p>The most important characteristic of SE is their extremely 
low kinetic energy. Because of the large mismatch in relative 
velocities between the primary beam electron (incident 
energy 1&ndash;30&nbsp;keV) and the weakly bound atomic electrons 
(1&ndash;15&nbsp;eV ionization energy), the transfer of kinetic energy 
from the primary electron to the SE is relatively small, and 
as a result, the SE are ejected with low kinetic energy. After 
ejection, the SE must propagate through the specimen while 
undergoing inelastic scattering, which further decreases 
their kinetic energy. SE are generated along the complete 
trajectory of the beam electron within the specimen, but 
only a very small fraction of SE reach the surface with suffi-
cient kinetic energy to exceed the surface energy barrier and 
escape. The energy spectrum of the secondary electrons that 
escape is peaked at only a few eV, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;3.1a for 
a measurement of a copper target and an incident beam 
energy of E
</p>
<p>0
 = 1&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;Above this peak, the intensity falls rap-
</p>
<p>idly at higher kinetic energy (Koshikawa and Shimizu 1973). 
. Figure&nbsp;3.1b shows the cumulative intensity as a function 
of energy: 67 % of the secondary electrons from copper are 
emitted with less than 4&nbsp; eV, and 90 % have less than 
8.4&nbsp;eV.&nbsp;Secondary electron production is considered to cease 
for kinetic energies above 50&nbsp;eV, an arbitrary but reasonable 
value considering how sharply the energy distribution of 
. Fig.&nbsp;3.1a is skewed toward low energy. Inspection of the 
literature of secondary electrons confirms that the distribu-
tion for copper is generally representative of a large range of 
metals and other materials (e.g., Kanaya and Ono 1984).
</p>
<p>3.3  Escape Depth of&nbsp;Secondary Electrons
</p>
<p>The kinetic energy of SE is so low that it has a strong influence 
on the depth from which SE can escape from the specimen. 
While some inelastic scattering processes are absent because 
of the low kinetic energy of SE, nevertheless SE suffer rapid 
energy loss with distance traveled, limiting the range of an SE 
</p>
<p>to a few nanometers rather than the hundreds to thousands of 
nanometers for the energetic beam electrons and BSE.&nbsp;Thus, 
although SE are generated along the entire trajectory of a beam 
electron scattering in the target, only those SE generated close 
to a surface have a significant chance to escape. The probabil-
ity of escape depends on the initial kinetic energy, the depth 
of generation, and the nature of the host material. Since there 
is a spectrum of initial kinetic energies, each energy repre-
sents a different escape probability and depth sensitivity. This 
complex behavior is difficult to measure directly, and instead 
researchers have made use of the Monte Carlo simulation to 
characterize the escape depth. . Figure&nbsp; 3.2a shows the rela-
tive intensity of secondary electrons (over the energy range 
0&ndash;50&nbsp; eV) that escape from a copper target as a function of 
the depth of generation in the solid (Koshikawa and Shimizu 
1974). . Figure&nbsp;3.2b shows this same data in the form of the 
cumulative secondary electron intensity as a function of initial 
generation depth. For copper, virtually no secondary electron 
escapes if it is created below approximately 8&nbsp; nm from the 
surface, and 67 % of the secondary emission originates from 
a depth of less than 2.2&nbsp;nm and 90 % from less than 4.4&nbsp;nm. 
Kanaya and Ono (1984) modeled the mean secondary electron 
escape depth, d
</p>
<p>esc
, in terms of various material parameters:
</p>
<p>d A I Z
esc
</p>
<p>0.66
nm = 0.267 /( ) ( )r
</p>
<p> 
(3.2)
</p>
<p>where A is the atomic weight (g/mol), ρ is the density (g/
cm3), Z is the atomic number, and I is the first ionization 
potential (eV). When this model is applied to the solid ele-
ments of the Periodic Table, the complex behavior seen in 
. Fig.&nbsp;3.3 results. The mean escape depth varies from a low 
value of ~ 0.25&nbsp;nm for Ce to a high value of 9&nbsp;nm for Li. For 
copper, d
</p>
<p>esc
 is calculated to be 1.8&nbsp; nm, which can be com-
</p>
<p>pared to the 50 % escape value of 1.3&nbsp; nm from the Monte 
Carlo simulation study in . Fig.&nbsp;3.2b. Systematic behavior of 
the atomic properties in Eq.&nbsp;3.1 leads to systematic trends in 
the mean escape depth, with the low density alkali metals 
showing the largest values for the escape depth, while min-
ima occur for the highest density elements in each period.

<p>3.4  Secondary Electron Yield Versus 
Atomic Number
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp; 3.4 shows a plot of the secondary electron coef-
ficient as a function of atomic number for an incident beam 
energy of E
</p>
<p>0
 = 5&nbsp; keV with data taken from A Database of 
</p>
<p>Electron- Solid Interactions of Joy (2012). The measurements 
of δ are chaotic and inconsistent. For example, the values of 
δ for gold reported by various workers range from approxi-
mately 0.4 to 1.2. Oddly, all of these measured values may 
be &ldquo;correct&rdquo; in the sense that a valid, reproducible mea-
surement was made on the particular specimen used. This 
behavior is really an indication of how difficult it is to make a

<p>at such elevated pressures even when ion beam cleaning is 
utilized to expose the &ldquo;true&rdquo; surface. The effective second-
ary electron coefficient of a &ldquo;real&rdquo; material under typical 
SEM or VP-SEM vacuum conditions is unlikely to pro-
duce a consistent, predictable response as a function of the 
composition of the nominal substance under examination. 
</p>
<p>Thus, while compositionally dependent secondary electron 
signals may be occasionally observed, they are generally 
not predictable and reproducible, which is the critical basis 
for establishing a useful contrast mechanism such as that 
found for backscattered electrons as a function of atomic 
number.

<p>3.5  Secondary Electron Yield Versus 
Specimen Tilt
</p>
<p>When the secondary electron coefficient is measured as a 
function of the specimen tilt angle, θ (i.e., the specimen incli-
nation to the beam, where a tilt of 0&deg; means that the beam is 
perpendicular to the surface), a monotonic increase with tilt is 
observed, as shown for copper at two different incident beam 
energies in . Fig.&nbsp;3.5, which is taken from the measurements 
of Koshikawa and Shimizu (1973). This increase in δ with θ 
can be understood from the geometric argument presented 
schematically in . Fig.&nbsp; 3.6. As the primary beam enters the 
specimen, the rate of secondary electron production is effec-
tively constant along the path that lies within the shallow sec-
ondary electron escape depth because the beam electrons 
have not yet undergone sufficient scattering to modify their 
energies or trajectories. The length of the primary beam path 
within the depth of escape, d
</p>
<p>esc
, increases as the secant of the 
</p>
<p>tilt angle. Assuming that the number of secondary electrons 
that eventually escape will be proportional to the number pro-
duced in this near surface region, the secondary electron coef-
ficient is similarly expected to rise with the secant of the tilt 
angle. As shown in . Fig.&nbsp;3.5, the measured dependence of δ 
upon θ does not rise as fast as the secant relation that the sim-
ple geometric argument predicts. This deviation from the 
secant function model in . Fig.&nbsp;3.6 is due to the large contri-
bution of secondary electrons produced by the exiting back-
scattered electrons which follow different trajectories through 
the escape layer, as discussed below.
</p>
<p>The monotonic dependence of the secondary electron 
coefficient on the local surface inclination is an important 
factor in producing topographic contrast that reveals the 
shape of an object.
</p>
<p>3.6  Angular Distribution of&nbsp; 
Secondary Electrons
</p>
<p>When a secondary electron is generated within the escape 
depth below the surface, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;3.7a, the short-
est path to the surface, s, lies along the direction parallel to 
the local surface normal. For any other trajectory at an 
angle φ relative to this surface normal, the path length 
increases in length as s/cos φ. The probability of secondary 
electron escape decreases as the escape path length 
increases, so that the angular distribution of emitted

<p>secondary electrons is expected to follow a cosine relation 
with the emergence angle relative to the local surface nor-
mal. Behavior close to a cosine relation is seen in the Monte 
Carlo simulation of Koshikawa and Shimizu (1974) in 
. Fig.&nbsp;3.7b.
</p>
<p>Even when the surface is highly tilted relative to the beam, 
the escape path length situation for a secondary electron gen-
erated below the surface is identical to the case for normal 
beam incidence, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;3.7c. Thus, the secondary 
electron trajectories follow a cosine distribution relative to 
the local surface normal regardless of the specimen tilt.
</p>
<p>3.7  Secondary Electron Yield Versus Beam 
Energy
</p>
<p>The secondary electron coefficient increases as the incident 
beam energy decreases, as shown for copper in . Fig.&nbsp;3.8a for 
the conventional beam energy range (5&nbsp; keV &le; E
</p>
<p>0
 &le; 30&nbsp; keV) 
</p>
<p>and in . Fig.&nbsp;3.8b for the low beam energy range (E
0
 &lt; 5&nbsp;keV). 
</p>
<p>This behavior arises from two principal factors: (1) as the 
beam electron energy decreases, the rate of energy loss, dE/ds, 
increases so that more energy is deposited per unit of beam 
electron path length leading to more secondary electron gen-
eration per unit of path length; and (2) the range of the beam 
</p>
<p>electrons is reduced so more of that energy is deposited and 
more secondary electrons are generated in the near surface 
region from which secondary electrons can escape. This is a 
general behavior found across the Periodic Table, as seen in 
the plots for C, Al, Cu, Ag, and Au in . Fig.&nbsp;3.8c.
</p>
<p>3.8  Spatial Characteristics of&nbsp;Secondary 
Electrons
</p>
<p>As the beam electrons enter the sample surface, they begin to 
generate secondary electrons in a cylindrical volume whose 
cross section is defined by the footprint of the beam on the 
entrance surface and whose height is the escape depth of the 
SE, as shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;3.9 These entrance surface 
SE, designated the SE
</p>
<p>1
 class, preserve the lateral spatial resolu-
</p>
<p>tion information defined by the dimensions of the focused 
beam and are similarly sensitive to the properties of the near 
surface region due to the shallow scale of their origin. As the 
beam electrons move deeper into the solid, they continue to 
generate SE, but these SE rapidly lose their small initial kinetic 
energy and are completely reabsorbed within an extremely 
short range. However, for those beam electrons that subse-
quently undergo enough scattering to return to the entrance 
surface to emerge as backscattered electrons (or reach any

<p>other surface for specimens with more complex topography 
than a simple flat bulk target), the SE that they continue to gen-
erate as they approach the surface region will escape and add to 
the total secondary electron production, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;3.9. 
This class of SE is designated SE
</p>
<p>2
 and they are indistinguishable 
</p>
<p>from the SE
1
 class based on their energy and angular distribu-
</p>
<p>tions. However, because of their origin from the backscattered 
electrons, the SE
</p>
<p>2
 class actually carries the degraded lateral spa-
</p>
<p>tial distribution of the BSE: because the relative number of SE
2
 
</p>
<p>rises and falls with backscattering, the SE
2
 signal actually car-
</p>
<p>ries the same information as BSE.&nbsp;That is, the relative number 
of the SE
</p>
<p>2
 scales with whatever specimen property affects elec-
</p>
<p>tron backscattering. Finally, the BSE that leave the specimen 
are energetic, and after traveling millimeters to centimeters in 
the specimen chamber, these BSE are likely to hit other metal 
surfaces (objective lens polepiece, chamber walls, stage compo-
nents, etc.), generating a third set of secondary electrons desig-
nated SE
</p>
<p>3
. The SE
</p>
<p>3
 class again represents BSE information, 
</p>
<p>including the degraded spatial resolution, not true SE
1
 infor-
</p>
<p>mation and resolution. The SE
1
 and SE
</p>
<p>2
 classes represent an 
</p>
<p>inherent property of a material, while the SE
3
 class depends on 
</p>
<p>the details of the SEM specimen chamber. Peters (1984) mea-
sured the three secondary electron classes for thin and thick 
gold targets to estimate the relative populations of each class:
</p>
<p>Incident beam footprint, high resolution, SE
1
 (9 %)
</p>
<p>BSE generated at specimen, low resolution, SE
2
 (28 %)
</p>
<p>BSE generated remotely on lens, chamber walls, SE
3
 (61 %)
</p>
<p>A small SE contribution designated the SE
4
 class arises from 
</p>
<p>pre-specimen instrumental sources such as the final aperture 
(2 %) that depends in detail on the instrument construction 
(apertures, magnetic fields, etc.). These measurements show 
</p>
<p>that for gold the sum of the SE
2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
 classes which actually 
</p>
<p>carry BSE is nearly ten times larger than the high resolution, 
high surface sensitivity SE
</p>
<p>1
 component. These three classes of 
</p>
<p>secondary electrons influence SEM images of compositional 
structures and topographic structures in complex ways. The 
appearance of the SE image of a structure depends on the 
details of the secondary electron emission and the properties 
of the secondary electron detector used to capture the signal, 
as discussed in detail in the image formation module.

<p>4.1  Overview
</p>
<p>Energetic beam electrons stimulate the atoms of the speci-
men to emit &ldquo;characteristic&rdquo; X-ray photons with sharply 
defined energies that are specific to each atom species. The 
critical condition for generating characteristic X-rays is that 
the energy of the beam electron must exceed the electron 
binding energy, the critical ionization energy E
</p>
<p>c
, for the par-
</p>
<p>ticular atom species and the K-, L-, M-, and/or N- atomic 
shell(s). For efficient excitation, the incident beam energy 
should be at least twice the critical excitation energy, E
</p>
<p>0
 &gt; 2 E
</p>
<p>c
.  
</p>
<p>Characteristic X-rays can be used to identify and quan-
tify the elements present within the interaction volume. 
Simultaneously, beam electrons generate bremsstrahlung, or 
braking radiation, which creates a continuous X-ray spec-
trum, the &ldquo;X-ray continuum,&rdquo; whose energies fill the range 
from the practical measurement threshold of 50 eV to the 
incident beam energy, E
</p>
<p>0
. This continuous X-ray spectrum 
</p>
<p>forms a spectral background beneath the characteristic 
X-rays which impacts accurate measurement of the charac-
teristic X-rays and determines a finite concentration limit of 
</p>
<p>detection. X-rays are generated throughout a large fraction 
of the electron interaction volume. The spatial resolution, 
lateral and in-depth, of electron-excited X-ray microanalysis 
can be roughly estimated with a modified Kanaya&ndash;Okayama 
range equation or much more completely described with 
Monte Carlo electron trajectory simulation. Because of their 
generation over a range of depth, X-rays must propagate 
through the specimen to reach the surface and are subject 
to photoelectric absorption which reduces the intensity at all 
photon energies, but particularly at low energies.

<p>4.2.1  Origin
</p>
<p>The process of generating characteristic X-rays is illustrated 
for a carbon atom in . Fig.&nbsp;4.1. In the initial ground state, the 
carbon atom has two electrons in the K-shell bound to the 
nucleus of the atom with an &ldquo;ionization energy&rdquo; E

</p>
<p>shells bound to the atom, with an ionization energy of 7 eV.&nbsp;An 
incident energetic beam electron having initial kinetic energy 
E
</p>
<p>in
 &gt; E
</p>
<p>c
 can scatter inelastically with a K-shell atomic electron 
</p>
<p>and cause its ejection from the atom, providing the beam elec-
tron transfers to the atomic electron kinetic energy at least 
equal to the ionization energy, which is the minimum energy 
necessary to promote the atomic electron out of the K-shell 
beyond the effective influence of the positive nuclear charge. 
The total kinetic energy transferred to the K-shell atomic elec-
tron can range up to half the energy of the incident electron. 
The outgoing beam electron thus suffers energy loss corre-
sponding to the carbon K-shell ionization energy E
</p>
<p>K
 = 284 eV 
</p>
<p>plus whatever additional kinetic energy is imparted:
</p>
<p>E E E E
out in K kin
= &minus; &minus;  (4.1)
</p>
<p>The ionized carbon atom is left with a vacancy in the K-shell 
which places it in a raised energy state that can be lowered 
through the transition of an electron from the L-shell to fill 
the K-vacancy. The difference in energy between these shells 
must be expressed through one of two possible routes:
 1. The left branch in . Fig.&nbsp;4.1 involves the transfer of this 
</p>
<p>K&ndash;L inter-shell transition energy difference to another 
L-shell electron, which is then ejected from the atom 
with a specific kinetic energy:
</p>
<p>E E E E
kin K L L
</p>
<p>270eV= &minus; &minus; =  (4.2a)
</p>
<p>This process leaves the atom with two L-shell vacancies 
for subsequent vacancy-filling transitions. This ejected 
electron is known as an &ldquo;Auger electron,&rdquo; and measure-
</p>
<p>ment of its characteristic kinetic energy can identify the 
atom species of its origin, forming the physical basis for 
&ldquo;Auger electron spectroscopy.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 2. The right branch in . Fig.&nbsp;4.1 involves the creation of an 
X-ray photon to carry off the inter-shell transition energy:
</p>
<p>E E E
ν
= &minus; =
</p>
<p>K L
277eV  (4.2b)
</p>
<p>Because the energies of the atomic shells of an element are 
sharply defined, the shell difference is also a sharply defined 
quantity, so that the resulting X-ray photon has an energy that is 
characteristic of the particular atom species and the shells 
involved and is thus designated as a &ldquo;characteristic X-ray.&rdquo; Char-
acteristic X-rays are emitted uniformly in all directions over the 
full unit sphere with 4 π steradians solid angle. Extensive tables 
of characteristic X-ray energies for elements with Z &ge; 4 (beryl-
lium) are provided in the database embedded within the DTSA-
II software. The characteristic X-ray photon energy has a very 
narrow range of just a few electronvolts depending on atomic 
number, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;4.2 for the K&ndash;L
</p>
<p>3
 transition.
</p>
<p>4.2.2  Fluorescence Yield
</p>
<p>The Auger and X-ray branches in . Fig.&nbsp;4.1 are not equally 
probable. For a carbon atom, characteristic X-ray emission 
only occurs for approximately 0.26 % of the K-shell ioniza-
tions. The fraction of the ionizations that produce photons is 
known as the &ldquo;fluorescence yield,&rdquo; ω. Most carbon K-shell 
ionizations thus result in Auger electron emission. The fluo-
rescence yield is strongly dependent on the atomic number 
of the atom, increasing rapidly with Z, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;4.3a 
for K-shell ionizations. L-shell and M-shell fluorescence

<p>yields are shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 4.3b, c; and K-, L-, and M-shell 
yields are compared in . Fig.&nbsp; 4.3d (Crawford et&nbsp; al. 2011). 
From . Fig.&nbsp;4.3d, it can be observed that, when an element 
can be measured with two different shells, ω

</p>
<p>The shell transitions for carbon are illustrated in the shell 
energy diagram shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 4.4a. Because of the small 
number of carbon atomic electrons, the shell energy values are 
limited, and only one characteristic X-ray energy is possible for 
carbon with a value of 277 eV. (The apparent possible transi-
tion from the L
</p>
<p>1
-shell to the K-shell is forbidden by the quan-
</p>
<p>tum mechanical rules that govern these inter-shell transitions.)
</p>
<p>4.2.3  X-Ray Families
</p>
<p>As the atomic number increases, the number of atomic elec-
trons increases and the shell structure becomes more com-
plex. For sodium, the outermost electron occupies the 
M-shell, so that a K-shell vacancy can be filled by a transition 
from the L-shell or the M-shell, producing two different 
characteristic X-rays, designated
</p>
<p>&Prime; &minus; &Prime; &Prime; α&Prime; = &minus; =K L K E E E
2,3 X K L
</p>
<p>1041eV( )  (4.3a)
</p>
<p>&Prime; &minus; &Prime; &Prime; β&Prime; = &minus; =K M K E E E( ) X K M 1071eV  (4.3b)
</p>
<p>For atoms with higher atomic number than sodium, addi-
tional possibilities exist for inter-shell transitions, as shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;4.4b, leading to splitting of the K &minus; L
</p>
<p>2,3
 into K &minus; L
</p>
<p>3
 
</p>
<p>and K &minus; L
2
 (Kα into Kα
</p>
<p>1
 and Kα
</p>
<p>2
), and similarly for Kβ into 
</p>
<p>Kβ
1
 and Kβ
</p>
<p>2
, which can be observed with energy dispersive 
</p>
<p>spectrometry for X-rays with energies above 20 keV.
As these additional inter-shell transitions become possi-
</p>
<p>ble, increasingly complex &ldquo;families&rdquo; of characteristic X-rays 
are created, as shown in the energy diagrams of . Fig.&nbsp;4.4c for 
L-shell X-rays, and 4.4d for M-shell X-rays. Only transitions 
that lead to X-rays that are measurable on a practical basis 
with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry are shown. (There 
are, for example, at least 25 L-shell transitions that are possi-
ble for a heavy element such as gold, but most are of such low 
abundance or are so close in energy to a more abundant tran-
sition as to be undetectable by energy dispersive X-ray 
spectrometry.)

<p>4.2.4  X-Ray Nomenclature
</p>
<p>Two systems are in use for designating X-rays. The 
traditional but now archaic Siegbahn system lists the 
shell where the original ionization occurs followed by a 
Greek letter or other symbol that suggests the order of 
the family members by their relative intensity, α &gt; β &gt; γ 
&gt; η &gt; ζ. For closely related members, numbers are also 
attached, for example, Lβ
</p>
<p>1
 through Lβ
</p>
<p>15
. Additionally, 
</p>
<p>Latin letters are used for the complex minor L-shell fam-
ily members: l, s, t, u, and v. While still the predominant 
labeling system used in commercial X-ray microanalysis 
software systems, the Siegbahn system has been officially 
</p>
<p>replaced by the International Union of Pure and Applied 
Chemistry (IUPAC) labeling protocol in which the first 
term denotes the shell or subshell where the original ion-
ization occurs while the second term indicates the sub-
shell from which the electron transition occurs to fill the 
vacancy; for example, Kα
</p>
<p>1
 is replaced by K-L
</p>
<p>3
 for a K-shell 
</p>
<p>ionization filled from the L
3
 subshell. . Table&nbsp; 4.1 gives 
</p>
<p>the correspondence between the Siegbahn and IUPAC 
labeling schemes for the characteristic X-rays likely to 
be detected by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. 
Note that for the M-shell, there are minor family mem-
bers detectable by EDS for which there are no Siegbahn  
designations.

<p>4.2.5  X-Ray Weights of&nbsp;Lines
</p>
<p>Within these families, the relative abundances of the charac-
teristic X-rays are not equal. For example, for sodium the 
ratio of the K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 to K-M is approximately 150:1, and this 
</p>
<p>ratio is a strong function of the atomic number, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 4.5a for the K-shell (Heinrich et&nbsp; al. 1979). For the 
L-shell and M-shell, the X-ray families have more members, 
and the relative abundances are complex functions of atomic 
number, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;4.5b, c.

the energy of the energetic beam electron is shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;4.6. Starting with a zero value at 1.838 keV, the K-shell 
ionization energy for silicon, the cross section rapidly 
increases to a peak value, and then slowly decreases with fur-
ther increases in the beam energy.
</p>
<p>The relationship of the energy of the exciting electron to

parameter and is designated the &ldquo;overvoltage,&rdquo; U:

<p>When several elements are mixed at the atomic level in a 
thin specimen, the relative production of X-rays from differ-
ent elements depends on the cross section and fluorescence 
yield, as given in Eq.&nbsp;4.7, and also on the partitioning of the 
X-ray production among the various possible members of 
the X-ray families, as plotted in . Fig.&nbsp; 4.5a&ndash;c. The relative 
production for the most intense transition in each X-ray fam-
ily is plotted in . Fig.&nbsp;4.8 for E
</p>
<p>0
 = 30 keV.&nbsp;. Figure&nbsp;4.8 reveals

</p>
<p>strong differences in the relative abundance of the X-rays 
produced by different elements. This plot also reveals that 
over certain atomic number ranges, two different atomic 
shells can be excited for each element, for example, K and L 
for Z = 16 to Z = 50, and L and M for Z = 36 to Z = 92. For 
lower values of E
</p>
<p>0
, these atomic number ranges will be 
</p>
<p>diminished.
</p>
<p> X-Ray Intensity Emitted from&nbsp;Thick, 
Solid&nbsp;Specimens
</p>
<p>A thick specimen is one with sufficient thickness so that it 
contains the full electron interaction volume, which gener-
ally requires a thickness of at least a few micrometers for 
most choices of composition and incident beam energy. 
Within the interaction volume, the complete range of elastic 
and inelastic scattering events occur. X-ray generation for 
each atom species takes place across the full energy range of 
the ionization cross section from the initial value corre-
sponding to the energy of the incident beam as it enters the 
specimen down to the ionization energy of each atom spe-
cies. Based upon experimental measurements, the X-ray 
intensity emitted from thick targets is found to follow an 
expression of the form
</p>
<p>I i E E E i U&asymp; &minus; &asymp; &minus;p 0 c 0
n
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>n
1( )  [ ]/  (4.8)
</p>
<p>where i
p
 is the beam current, and n is a constant depending 
</p>
<p>on the particular element and shell (Lifshin et&nbsp;al. 1980). The 
value of n is typically in the range 1.5&ndash;2.0. Equation&nbsp; 4.8 is 
plotted for an exponent of n = 1.7&nbsp;in . Fig.&nbsp;4.9. The intensity 
</p>
<p>rises rapidly from a zero value at U = 1. For a reasonably effi-
cient degree of X-ray excitation, it is desirable to select E
</p>
<p>0
 so 
</p>

</p>
<p>4.3  X-Ray Continuum (bremsstrahlung)
</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the inner shell ionization events that 
lead to characteristic X-ray emission, a second physical pro-
cess operates to generate X-rays, the &ldquo;braking radiation,&rdquo; or 
bremsstrahlung, process. As illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;4.10, because 
of the repulsion that the beam electron experiences in the 
negative charge cloud of the atomic electrons, it undergoes 
deceleration and loses kinetic energy, which is released as a 
photon of electromagnetic radiation. The energy lost due to 
deceleration can take on any value from a slight deceleration 
involving the loss of a few electron volts up to the loss of the 
total kinetic energy carried by the beam electron in a single 
event. Thus, the bremsstrahlung X-rays span all energies from 
a practical threshold of 100 eV up to the incident beam energy, 
E
</p>
<p>0
, which corresponds to an incident beam electron suffer-
</p>
<p>ing total energy loss by deceleration in the Coulombic field 
of a surface atom as the beam electron enters the target and 
before it has lost any energy in any other inelastic scattering 
events. The braking radiation process thus forms a continu-
ous energy spectrum, also referred to as the &ldquo;X-ray contin-
uum,&rdquo; from 100 eV to E
</p>
<p>0
, which is the so-called Duane&ndash;Hunt 
</p>
<p>limit. The X-ray continuum forms a background beneath any 
characteristic X-rays produced by the atoms. The bremsstrah-
lung process is anisotropic, being somewhat peaked in the

beam electron trajectories are nearly aligned, this anisotropy 
can result in a different continuum intensity in the forward 
direction along the beam relative to the backward direction. 
</p>
<p>However, in thick specimens, the near-randomization of 
the beam electron trajectory segments by elastic scattering 
effectively smooths out this anisotropy, so that the X-ray con-
tinuum is effectively rendered isotropic.

<p>4.3.1  X-Ray Continuum Intensity
</p>
<p>The intensity of the X-ray continuum, I
cm
</p>
<p> , at an energy E
ν
 is 
</p>
<p>described by Kramers (1923) as
</p>
<p>I i Z E E Ecm p 0&asymp; &minus; ν ν( ) /  (4.9)
</p>
<p>where i
p
 is the incident beam current and Z is the atomic 
</p>
<p>number. For a particular value of the incident energy, E
0
, the 
</p>
<p>intensity of the continuum decreases rapidly relative to lower 
photon energies as E
</p>
<p>ν
 approaches E
</p>
<p>0
, the Duane&ndash;Hunt limit.
</p>
<p>An important parameter in electron-excited X-ray micro-
analysis is the ratio of the characteristic X-ray intensity to the 
X-ray continuum intensity at the same energy, E
</p>
<p>ch
 = E
</p>
<p>ν
, often 
</p>
<p>referred to as the &ldquo;peak-to-background, P/B.&rdquo; The P/B can be 
estimated from Eqs. (4.8) and (4.9) with the approximation 
that E
</p>
<p>ν
 &asymp; E
</p>
<p>c
 so that Eq. (4.9) can be rewritten as&mdash;
</p>
<p>I i Z E E E i Z Ucm p 0 c p&asymp; &minus; &asymp; &minus;( )  ( )/ c 1  (4.10)

</p>
<p> 
(4.11)
</p>
<p>The P/B is plotted in . Fig.&nbsp; 4.11 with the assumption that 
n = 1.7, where it is seen that at low overvoltages, which are 
often used in electron-excited X-ray microanalysis, the char-
acteristic intensity is low relative to higher values of U, and 
the intensity rises rapidly with U, while the P/B increases 
rapidly at low overvoltage but then more slowly as the over-
voltage increases.
</p>
<p>4.3.2  The Electron-Excited X-Ray Spectrum, 
As-Generated
</p>
<p>The electron-excited X-ray spectrum generated within the 
target thus consists of characteristic and continuum X-rays 
and is shown for pure carbon with E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20 keV in . Fig.&nbsp;4.12, 
</p>
<p>as calculated with the spectrum simulator in NIST Desktop 
Spectrum Analyzer (Fiori et&nbsp;al. 1992), using the Pouchou and 
Pichoir expression for the K-shell ionization cross section and 
the Kramers expression for the continuum intensity (Pouchou 
and Pichoir 1991; Kramers 1923). Because of the energy 
dependence of the continuum given by Eq.&nbsp;4.10, the generated 
X-ray continuum has its highest intensity at the lowest photon 
energy and decreases at higher photon energies, reaching zero 
intensity at E
</p>
<p>0
. By comparison, the energy span of the charac-
</p>
<p>teristic C&ndash;K peak is its natural width of only 1.6 eV, which is 
related to the lifetime of the excited K-shell vacancy. The 
energy width for K-shell emission up to 25 keV photon energy 
is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;4.2 (Krause and Oliver 1979). For photon 
energies below 25 keV, the characteristic X-ray peaks from the 
K-, L-, and M- shells have natural widths less than 10 eV.&nbsp;In 
the calculated spectrum of . Fig.&nbsp;4.12, the C&ndash;K peak is there-
fore plotted as a narrow line. (X-ray peaks are often referred to 
as &ldquo;lines&rdquo; in the literature, a result of their appearance in high-
energy resolution measurements of X-ray spectra by diffrac-
tion-based X-ray spectrometers.) The X-ray spectra 
as-generated in the target for carbon, copper, and gold are 
compared in . Fig.&nbsp;4.13, where it can be seen that at all photon 
energies the intensity of the X-ray continuum increases with 
Z, as given by Eq.&nbsp;4.9. The increased complexity of the charac-
teristic X-rays at higher Z is also readily apparent.

<p>4.3.3  Range of&nbsp;X-ray Production
</p>
<p>As the beam electrons scatter inelastically within the tar-
get and lose energy, inner shell ionization events can be 
produced from U
</p>
<p>0
 down to U = 1, so that depending on E
</p>
<p>0
 
</p>
<p>and the value(s) of E
c
 represented by the various elements 
</p>
<p>in the target, X-rays will be generated over a substantial 
portion of the interaction volume. The &ldquo;X-ray range,&rdquo; a 
</p>
<p>crude estimate of the limiting range of X-ray generation, 
can be obtained from a simple modification of the 
Kanaya&ndash;Okayama range equation (IV-5) to compensate 
for the portion of the electron range beyond which the 
energy of beam electrons has deceased below a specific 
value of E

<p>The X-ray range given by Eq.&nbsp;4.12 provides a single value that 
captures the limit of the X-ray production but gives no infor-
mation on the complex distribution of X-ray production 
within the interaction volume. Monte Carlo electron simula-
tion can provide that level of detail (e.g., Drouin et al., 2007;

<p>method to model ϕ(ρz) by dividing the target into layers of 
constant thickness parallel to the surface, counting the X-rays 
produced in each layer, and then plotting the intensity as a his-
togram. The intensity in each layer is normalized by the inten-
sity produced in a single unsupported layer which is sufficiently 
thin so that no significant elastic scattering occurs: the electron 
trajectories pass through such a thin layer without deviation. 
The ϕ(ρz) distribution has several important characteristics. 
For a thick specimen, the intensity produced in the first layer 
exceeds that of the unsupported reference layer because in 
addition to the X-ray intensity produced by the passage of all of 
the beam electrons through the first layer, elastic scattering 
from deeper in the specimen creates backscattered electrons 
which pass back through the surface layer to escape the target, 
producing additional X-ray generation. The intensity produced 
in the first layer, designated ϕ
</p>
<p>0
, thus always exceeds unity 
</p>
<p>because of this extra X-ray production due to backscattering. 
Below the surface layer, ϕ(ρz) increases as elastic scattering 
increases the path length of the electrons that pass obliquely 
through each layer, compared to the relatively unscattered pas-
sage of the incident electrons through the outermost layers 
before elastic scattering causes significant deviation in the tra-
jectories. The reverse passage of backscattered electrons also 
adds to the generation of X-rays in the shallow layers. Eventually 
</p>
<p>a peak value in ϕ(ρz) is reached, beyond which the X-ray 
intensity decreases due to cumulative energy loss, which 
reduces the overvoltage, and the relative number of backscat-
tering events decreases. The ϕ(ρz) distribution then steadily 
decreases to a zero intensity when the electrons have sustained 
sufficient energy loss to reach overvoltage U = 1. The limiting 
X-ray production range is given by Eq.&nbsp;4.12.
</p>
<p>4.4  X-Ray Absorption
</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo simulations shown in . Fig.&nbsp;4.15b&ndash;d are in 
fact plots of the X-rays emitted from the sample. To escape the 
sample, the X-rays must pass through the sample atoms where 
they can undergo the process of photoelectric absorption. 
An X-ray whose energy exceeds the binding energy (critical 
excitation energy) for an atomic shell can transfer its energy to 
the bound electron, ejecting that electron from the atom with 
a kinetic energy equal to the X-ray energy minus the bind-
ing energy, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;4.17, which initiates the same 
processes of X-ray and Auger electron emission as shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;4.1 for inner shell ionization by energetic electrons. 
The major difference in the two processes is that the X-ray is 
annihilated in photoelectric absorption and its entire energy 
</p>
<p> Chapter 4 &middot; X-Rays</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>transferred to the ejected electron. Photoelectric absorption 
is quantified by the &ldquo;mass absorption coefficient,&rdquo; μ/ρ, which 
determines the fraction of X-rays that pass through a thickness 
s of a material acting as the absorber:
</p>
<p>I I/ /0 exp s= &minus; &micro; ρ ρ( )   (4.13)
</p>
<p>where I
0
 is the initial X-ray intensity and I is the intensity after 
</p>
<p>passing through a thickness, s, of a material with  density&nbsp;ρ. 
</p>
<p>The dimensions of the mass absorption coefficient are cm2/g. 
For a given material, mass absorption coefficients generally 
decrease with increasing photon energy, as shown for carbon 
in . Fig.&nbsp; 4.18a. The exception is near the critical excitation 
energy for the atomic shells of a material. The region near the 
C K-shell excitation energy of 284 eV is shown expanded in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 4.18b, where an abrupt increase in μ/ρ occurs. An 
X-ray photon whose energy is just slightly greater than the 
critical excitation energy for an atomic shell can very

<p> efficiently couple its energy to the bound electron, resulting 
in a high value of μ/ρ. With further increases in photon 
energy, the efficiency of the coupling of the photon energy to 
the bound electron decreases so that μ/ρ also decreases. For 
more complex atoms with more atomic shells, the mass 
absorption coefficient behavior with photon energy becomes 
more complicated, as shown for Cu in . Fig.&nbsp;4.19a, b, which 
shows the region of the three Cu L-edges. For Au, . Fig.&nbsp;4.20a&ndash;

<p>Photoelectric absorption reduces the X-ray intensity that 
is emitted from the target at all photon energies. The absorp-
tion loss from each layer of the ϕ(ρz) distribution is calcu-
lated using Eq.&nbsp;4.15 with the absorption path, s, determined as 
</p>
<p>shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 4.21a from the depth, d, of the histogram 
slice, and the cosecant of the X-ray detector &ldquo;take-off angle,&rdquo; 
ψ, which is the elevation angle of the detector above the 
 target surface:

</p>
<p>Normalizing by the intensity generated in each layer, the 
ϕ(ρz) histogram gives the probability, with a value between 0 
and 1, that a photon generated in that layer and emitted into 
the solid angle of the EDS detector will escape and reach the 
detector, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;4.16b for each histogram bin of 
the silicon ϕ(ρz) distribution. The escape probability of 
X-rays integrated over the complete ϕ(ρz) histogram gives 
the parameter designated &ldquo;f(χ),&rdquo; which is the overall escape 
probability, between 0 and 1, for an X-ray generated any-
where in the ϕ(ρz) distribution.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp; 4.21b shows a sequence of calculations of the 
C K ϕ(ρz) distribution and subsequent absorption as a func-
tion of incident beam energy. As the incident beam energy 
increases, the depth of electron penetration increases so that 
carbon characteristic X-rays are produced deeper in the tar-
get. For pure carbon with E
</p>
<p>0
 = 5 keV, the cumulative value of 
</p>
<p>f(χ) = 0.867; that is, 86.7 % of all carbon X-rays that are gener-
ated escape, while 13.3 % are absorbed. As the C X-rays are 
produced deeper with increasing beam energy, the total 
X-ray absorption increases so that the value of f(χ) for C K 
decreases sharply with increasing beam energy, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;4.21b and in . Table&nbsp;4.3.
</p>
<p>Thus, with E
0
 = 2 keV, 97.4 % of the carbon X-rays escape 
</p>
<p>the specimen, while at E
0
 = 30 keV, nearly 90 % of the carbon 
</p>
<p>X-rays generated in pure carbon are absorbed before they 
can exit the specimen.
</p>
<p>When the parameter f(χ) is plotted at every photon energy 
from the threshold of 100 eV up to the Duane&ndash;Hunt limit of 
the incident beam energy E
</p>
<p>0
, X-ray absorption is seen to 
</p>
<p>sharply modify the X-ray spectrum that is emitted from the 
target, as illustrated for carbon (. Fig.&nbsp; 4.22), copper 
(. Fig.&nbsp;4.23), and gold (. Fig.&nbsp;4.24). The high relative intensity 
of the X-ray continuum at low photon energies compared to 
higher photon energies in the generated spectrum is greatly 
diminished in the emitted spectrum because of the higher 
absorption suffered by low energy photons. Discontinuities 
</p>
<p>in f(χ) are seen at the critical ionization energy of the K-shell 
in carbon, the K- and L-shells in copper, and the M- and 
L-shells in gold, corresponding to the sharp increase in μ/ρ 
just above the critical ionization energy. Because the X-ray 
continuum is generated at all photon energies, the continuum 
is affected by every ionization edge represented by the atomic 
species present, resulting in abrupt steps in the background. 
An abrupt decrease in X-ray continuum intensity is observed 
just above the absorption edge energy due to the increase in 
the mass absorption coefficient. The characteristic peaks in 
these spectra are also diminished by absorption, but because 
a characteristic X-ray is always lower in energy than the ion-
ization edge energy from which it originated, the mass 
absorption coefficient for characteristic X-rays is lower than 
that for photons with energies just above the shell ionization 
energies. Thus an element is relatively transparent to its own 
characteristic X-rays because of the decrease in X-ray absorp-
tion below the ionization edge energy.
</p>
<p>4.5  X-Ray Fluorescence
</p>
<p>As a consequence of photoelectric absorption shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;4.17, the atom will subsequently undergo de-excitation 
following the same paths as is the case for electron ionization 
in . Fig.&nbsp;4.1. Thus, the primary X-ray spectrum of character-
istic and continuum X-rays generated by the beam electron 
inelastic scattering events gives rise to a secondary X-ray 
spectrum of characteristic X-rays generated as a result of tar-
get atoms absorbing those characteristic and continuum 
X-rays and emitting lower energy characteristic X-rays. 
Because continuum X-rays are produced up to E
</p>
<p>0
, the 
</p>
<p>Duane&ndash;Hunt limit, all atomic shells present with E
c
 &lt; E
</p>
<p>0
 will 
</p>
<p>be involved in generating secondary X-rays, which is referred 
to as &ldquo;secondary X-ray fluorescence&rdquo; by the X-ray micro-
analysis community. Generally, at any characteristic photon 
energy the contribution of secondary fluorescence is only a 
few percent or less of the intensity produced by the direct 
electron ionization events. However, there is a substantial 
difference in the spatial distribution of the primary and sec-
ondary X-rays. The primary X-rays must be produced within 
the interaction volume of the beam electrons, which gener-
ally has limiting dimensions of a few micrometers at most. 
The secondary X-rays can be produced over a much larger 
volume because the range of X-rays in a material is typically 
an order-of-magnitude (or more) greater than the range of 
an electron beam with E
</p>
<p>0
 from 5 to 30 keV.&nbsp; This effect is 
</p>
<p>shown in . Fig.&nbsp;4.25 for an alloy of Ni-10 % Fe for the second-
ary fluorescence of Fe K-shell X-rays (E
</p>
<p>K
 = 7.07 keV) by the 
</p>
<p>electron- excited Ni K-L
2,3
</p>
<p> X-rays (7.47 keV). The hemispher-
ical volume that contains 99 % of the secondary Fe K-L
</p>

<p>5.1  Electron Beam Parameters
</p>
<p>This chapter addresses essential topics: the quantitative attri-
butes of an electron beam, well-known widely-used SEM 
modes, and electron detectors.
</p>
<p> z Why Learn About Electron Optical Parameters?
</p>
<p>As we mentioned in the introduction to the book, the main 
goal of the text is to help users understand how to operate the 
SEM and its accessories, and how to be effective at using 
these powerful tools for materials characterization and anal-
ysis. It is a fair question, then, to ask why an operator of the 
microscope needs to understand electron optics and the 
optical parameters of the beam. Clearly an SEM design engi-
neer needs to be conversant in these subjects, but why learn 
these concepts as an end user? The simplest answer is that 
while all SEMs have knobs, switches, and controls, in the end 
it is the electron optical beam parameters that the operator is 
controlling, and a basic understanding of what is being 
changed by those knobs is essential to becoming a skilled 
user. Whether the knobs and dials are &ldquo;old-school&rdquo; analog 
hardware devices or purely virtual objects that exist only in a 
software user interface, the operator cannot use the SEM to 
best advantage without a clear picture of how those knobs are 
changing the beam.
</p>
<p>5.2  Electron Optical Parameters
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;5.1 shows the basic features of an electron beam in a 
scanning electron microscope after it emerges from the final 
aperture of the objective lens and before it impacts the sam-
ple surface. While changes to the beam inside the electron 
gun and inside the electron column are also important to the 
SEM operator, a thorough understanding of the attributes of 
the beam in the chamber is absolutely essential to mastery of 
the instrument.
</p>
<p>5.2.1  Beam Energy
</p>
<p>One of the fundamental beam parameters is the energy of the 
electrons in the beam, measured in electronvolts (eV) and 
often represented by the symbol E, or E
</p>
<p>0
. This parameter rep-
</p>
<p>resents the initial energy of the electrons as they enter the 
SEM chamber or the sample. Beam energy has a direct effect 
on many important aspects of SEM operation, such as the 
size of the excitation volume in the sample and the intensity 
of the X-rays emitted, so it is necessary to choose this param-
eter carefully and set it to an appropriate value before acquir-
ing data. Frequently the beam energy is several thousand 
electronvolts or higher, so the kilo-electronvolt is the most 
common unit of beam energy, abbreviated keV.&nbsp;One keV is 
equal to 1000&nbsp;eV, and many SEMs are capable of generating 
electron beams up to 30&nbsp;keV (equal to 30,000&nbsp;eV), or in a few 
cases even higher.
</p>
<p>If you have any experience with electronics or electrical 
engineering, the electronvolt as a unit of energy may be con-
fusing at first since it sounds more like a measure of voltage, 
unlike the more common units of energy such as the Joule, 
the calorie, or the erg. The terms electron volt and the related 
SI unit electronvolt are related to the method used by the SEM 
to impart energy to the electrons that emerge from the elec-
tron source. Typically, the electrons are accelerated from low 
energy to high energy using an electrostatic potential differ-
ence generated by a high-voltage power supply. Negatively 
charged electrons are repelled from surfaces with negative 
electrical potential and attracted to surfaces with positive 
potential, and the potential difference is measured in volts. 
One electronvolt is simply the energy acquired by an electron 
when it is accelerated through a potential difference of one 
volt; similarly, an electron that drops through a voltage differ-
ence of 20 kilovolts (20&nbsp;kV) emerges with an energy of 20&nbsp;keV.
</p>
<p>This underlying connection between the accelerating 
voltage used by the microscope and the resulting beam 
energy can help make sense of the different terminol-
ogy often used in the SEM community regarding &ldquo;beam 
energy.&rdquo; On many microscopes, you set the accelerating 
voltage with a knob or by using a graphical user interface 
on a computer. On these microscopes, you would select 
30&nbsp;kV for the accelerating voltage if you wanted to work at 
high beam energy, or you might select 1&nbsp;kV if you wished to 
work at low voltage. Other microscope interfaces allow you 
to select the beam energy directly instead of the accelerat-

</p>
<p>ing voltage, so the corresponding settings would be 30&nbsp;keV 
for high beam energy work and 1&nbsp;keV for low-voltage oper-
ation. In informal conversation it is common to hear 30&nbsp;kV 
and 30&nbsp;keV used interchangeably to mean the same beam 
setting, and usually no confusion arises from this practice. 
However, in written documents such as reports of analyses 
or academic publications, the common error of describing 
the beam energy using units of kilovolts or of recording the 
accelerating voltage in units of kilo-electronvolts should be 
avoided.
</p>
<p> Landing Energy
</p>
<p>Aside from this possible confusion between beam energy and 
accelerating potential, there are other subtleties in the proper 
characterization of the beam energy in the SEM.&nbsp;Depending 
on the technology used by the microscope manufacturer, 
the electrons in the microscope may change energy more 
than once during their path from the electron source to the 
surface of the sample. Some microscopes seek to improve 
imaging performance by modifying the electrons&rsquo; energy 
during the mid-portion of the optical column. On more 
recent microscope models it is increasingly common to see 
beam deceleration options, which decrease the beam energy 
just before the electrons emerge from the objective lens.
</p>
<p>Also common on modern instruments is the option to 
apply a voltage bias to the sample itself, thus allowing the 
SEM operator to increase the energy of the electrons as they 
approach the sample (in the case of a positive sample bias), or 
decrease the energy of the electrons (in the case of a negative 
sample bias). For example, if the electron beam emerges from 
the objective lens into the SEM sample chamber with a beam 
energy of 5&nbsp;keV, but the sample has a negative voltage bias of 
1&nbsp;kV applied, the electrons will be decelerated to an energy of 
4&nbsp;keV when they impact the specimen.
</p>
<p>The term used to describe the electron beam energy at 
the point of impact on the sample surface is landing energy, 
usually denoted by the symbol E
</p>
<p>l
. The physics of beam&ndash;speci-
</p>
<p>men interaction depends only on the landing energy of the 
electrons, not on their energy at points further up the optical 
path. Critically important phenomena such as the size of the 
excitation volume in the specimen, the number of character-
istic X-ray peaks available for use in compositional measure-
ments, or the high energy limit of continuum X-rays emitted 
(the Duane&ndash;Hunt limit) are all functions of the landing 
energy, not the initial beam energy. Because of this, it is very 
important for the SEM operator to understand when land-
ing energy differs from the beam energy at the objective lens 
final aperture, and how to control the value of the landing 
energy. The details of such subtleties vary from one vendor 
to another, and even from one microscope model to the next, 
but they are invariably described in the user documentation 
for every instrument. Seek help from your microscope&rsquo;s cus-
tomer support team or an application engineer if you are not 
absolutely clear on how to control the landing energy on your 
microscope. In many situations, particularly when working 
with older microscopes, this distinction is not important 
and the terms beam energy and landing energy may be used 
</p>
<p>interchangeably without a problem, but when the distinction 
matters it can be crucial to accurate analysis and proper com-
munication or reporting.
</p>
<p>5.2.2  Beam Diameter
</p>
<p>Another important electron beam characteristic under the 
control of the SEM operator is the diameter of the electron 
beam, which in most cases refers to the diameter of the beam 
as it impacts the sample surface. Beam diameter has units of 
length and is frequently measured in nanometers, &Aring;ngstroms, 
or micrometers, depending on the size of the beam. For most 
SEM applications the beam diameter will fall within the 
broad range of 1&nbsp;nm to 1&nbsp;μm. It is commonly represented by 
the symbol d, or a subscripted variant such as dprobe or dp.
</p>
<p>Before developing an understanding of the importance of 
beam&ndash;specimen interactions, many SEM operators naively 
assume that the resolution of their SEM images is dictated 
solely by the beam diameter. While this may be true in some 
situations, more often the relationship between the beam 
diameter and the resolution is a complex one. Perhaps this 
explains why the exact definition of beam diameter is not 
always provided, even in relatively careful writing or formal 
contexts. The simplest model of an electron beam is one 
where the beam has a circular cross section at all times, and 
that the electrons are distributed with uniform intensity 
everywhere inside the beam diameter and are completely 
absent outside the beam diameter. In this trivial case, the 
beam has hard boundaries and is the same size no matter 
which azimuth you use to measure it. In reality the electron 
beam in an SEM is much more complicated. Even if you 
assume that the cross section is circular, electron beams 
exhibit a gradient of electron density from the core of the 
beam out to the edges, and in many cases have a tail of faint 
intensity that extends quite far from the central flux. It is still 
possible in these case to define the meaning of beam diame-
ter in a precise way, in terms of the full width at half- 
maximum of the intensity for example, or the full width at 
tenth-maximum if the tails are pronounced. More careful 
statistical models of the beam will specify the radial intensity 
distribution function&mdash;a Gaussian or Lorentzian distribu-
tion, for example&mdash;and will allow for non-circularity. In most 
situations where such precision is not warranted, however, it 
will suffice to assume that the beam diameter is a single num-
ber that characterizes the width in nanometers of that por-
tion of the beam that gives rise to the most important fraction 
of the contrast or sample excitation as measured at the sur-
face of the specimen.
</p>
<p>5.2.3  Beam Current
</p>
<p>Of all the electron beam parameters that matter to the SEM 
operator, beam current is perhaps highest on the list. 
Fortunately it is a relatively simple parameter to understand 
since it is entirely analogous to electrical currents of the kind 
</p>
<p>5.2 &middot; Electron Optical Parameters</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>68
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>found in wires, electronics, or electrical engineering. Beam 
current at the sample surface is a measure of the number of 
electrons per second that impact the specimen. It is usually 
measured in fractions of an ampere, such as microamperes 
(μA), nanoamperes (nA), or picoamperes (pA). A typical 
SEM beam current is about 1&nbsp;nA, which corresponds to 6.25 
&times; 109 electrons per second, or approximately one electron 
striking the sample every 160&nbsp;ps . The usual symbol used to 
represent beam current is I, or i, or a subscripted variant such 
as Iprobe, Ibeam, Ip, or Ib.
</p>
<p>5.2.4  Beam Current Density
</p>
<p>Similar to the beam current, the concept of current density is 
relatively easy to understand and corresponds directly with 
the same concept in electrical engineering or electrical 
design. Current density in an electron beam is defined as the 
beam current per unit area, and it is usually represented by 
the symbol J, or Jbeam. In standard units this quantity is 
expressed in A/m2, but there are also derived units better 
suited to the SEM such as nA/nm2 or similar. The most 
important thing to understand about current density is that 
it is an areal measure, not an absolute measure; this means 
the current depends directly on and varies linearly with the 
area of the region through which the stated current density 
passes.
</p>
<p>To make this concrete, let&rsquo;s consider an example calcula-
tion of the current density in an electron beam. . Figure&nbsp;5.2 
shows a circular beam with a diameter of 5&nbsp;nm; and the total 
current inside the circular beam spot is 1&nbsp;nA.&nbsp;The area of the 
beam is

<p>. Figure&nbsp;5.2b shows the situation if you decrease the diame-
ter of the beam by half, from 5&nbsp;nm to 2.5&nbsp;nm, yet keep the 
same total current in the beam. Now the area has gotten 
smaller, yet the current is unchanged, so the current density 
has increased. The new current density is

</p>
<p>Since focusing the electron beam in an SEM changes the 
diameter of the beam but does not change the beam current, 
the current density must change. As can be seen in . Fig.&nbsp;5.2, 
shrinking the beam width by a factor of two results in a four-
fold increase in beam current density.
</p>
<p>5.2.5  Beam Convergence Angle, α
</p>
<p>One of the fundamental characteristics of the electron beam 
found in all SEM instruments is that the shape of the beam as 
seen from the side is not a parallel-sided cylinder like a pen-
cil, but rather a cone. The beam is wide where it exits the final 
aperture of the objective lens, and narrows steadily until (if 
the sample is in focus) it converges to a very small spot when 
it enters the specimen. A schematic of this cone is shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;5.3. The point where the beam lands on the sample is 
denoted S at the bottom of the cone, and the beam-defining 
aperture is shown in perspective as a circle at the top of the 
cone, with line segment AB equal to the diameter of that 
aperture, dapt. The vertical dashed line represents the optical 
axis of the SEM column, which ideally passes through the 
center of the final aperture, is perpendicular to the plane of 
that aperture, and extends down through the chamber into 
the sample and beyond. The sides of the cone are defined by 
the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; of the electron beam. As mentioned above in the 
definition of the beam diameter, this notion of a hard-edged

</p>
<p>beam may not be physically realistic, but it is simple to 
understand and works well for our purposes here of under-
standing basic beam parameters.
</p>
<p>In geometry, the opening angle of a cone is defined as the 
vertex angle ASB at the point of the cone, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 5.3a. When working with the electron optics of an 
SEM, by convention we use the term convergence angle to 
describe how quickly the electron beam narrows to its focus 
as it travels down the optic axis. This convergence angle is 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;5.3b as α, which is half of the cone opening 
angle. In some cases, the beam convergence angle is referred 
to as the convergence half-angle to emphasize that only half of 
the opening angle is intended.
</p>
<p>Generally the numerical value of the beam convergence 
angle in the SEM is quite small, and the electron beam cones 
are much sharper and narrower than the cones used for sche-
matic purposes in . Fig.&nbsp;5.3. In fact, if you ground down and 
reshaped the sides of a sewing needle so that it was a true 
cone instead of a cylinder sharpened only at the tip, you 
would then have a cone whose size and shape is reasonably 
close to the dimensions found in the SEM.
</p>
<p>Estimating the value of the convergence angle of an 
electron beam is not difficult using the triangles drawn in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 5.3. The length of the vertical dashed line along the 
optical axis is called the working distance, usually denoted by 
the symbol W. It is merely the distance from the bottom of 
the objective lens pole piece (taken here to be approximately 
the same plane as the final aperture) to the point at which 
the beam converges, which is typically also the surface of the 
sample if the sample is in focus. In practical SEM configura-
tions this distance can be as small as a fraction of a millime-
ter or as large as tens of millimeters or a few centimeters, but 
in most situations W will be between 1&nbsp;mm and 5&nbsp;mm or 
so. The diameter of the wide end of the cone, line segment 
AB, is the aperture diameter, dapt. This can also vary widely 
depending on the SEM model and the choices made by the 
operator, but it is certainly no larger than a fraction of a mil-
limeter and can be much smaller, on the order of microm-
eters. For purposes of concreteness, let&rsquo;s assume W is 5&nbsp;mm 
(i.e., 5000&nbsp;μm) and the aperture is 50&nbsp;μm in diameter (25&nbsp;μm 
in radius, denoted rapt).
</p>
<p>From . Fig.&nbsp; 5.3b we can see that triangle ASB is com-
posed of two back-to-back right triangles. The rightmost of 
these has its vertex angle labeled α. The leg of that triangle 
adjacent to α is the working distance W, the opposite leg is 
the aperture radius rapt, and the hypotenuse of the right tri-
angle is the slant length of the beam cone, SB. From basic 
trigonometry we know that the tangent of the angle is equal 
to the length of its opposite leg divided by its adjacent leg, or

</p>
<p>5.2.6  Beam Solid Angle
</p>
<p>In the previous section we defined the beam convergence 
angle in terms of 2D geometry and characterized it by a 
planar angle measured in the dimensionless units of radi-
ans. However, the electron beam forms a 3D cone, not a 2D 
triangle, so in reality it subtends a solid angle. This is a con-
cept used in 3D geometry to describe the angular spread of 
a converging (or diverging) flux. The usual symbol for solid 
angle is Ω, and its units of measure are called steradians, 
abbreviated sr. Usually when solid angles are discussed in the 
context of the SEM they are used to describe the acceptance 
angle of an X-ray spectrometer, or sometimes a backscat-
tered electron detector, but they are also important in fully 
describing the electron optical parameters of the primary 
beam in the SEM as well as the properties of electron guns.

<p>of the figure and converging on the sample surface. The 
diameter of that aperture is dapt, and the area of the aperture 
is aapt. As discussed earlier, the distance the beam travels ver-
tically from the final aperture to the point where it is focused 
to a spot is the working distance, W. Now imagine a complete 
sphere centered on the beam impact point, and with spheri-
cal radius equal to W. The upper hemisphere of this imagi-
nary dome is depicted in . Fig.&nbsp; 5.4 as well, and since its 
radius is W, the beam-defining aperture will lie on the sur-
face of this sphere.
</p>
<p>The key to understanding the meaning of solid angles and 
their numerical measure using units of steradians is to con-
sider such a complete sphere and the fractional surface area 
of that sphere that is occupied by the object of interest. Every 
complete sphere, regardless of diameter, subtends exactly 4π 
steradians of solid angle. It follows that every hemisphere 
represents a solid angle of 2π steradians, no matter how small 
or how large the hemisphere might measure in meters. On 
the other hand, the surface area of a sphere Asphere most 
certainly depends on the radius r, and can be calculated using 
the ancient formula

<p>For the imaginary sphere and electron beam aperture shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;5.4, we can assume realistic numbers for this calcu-
lation by adopting the values used in the beam convergence 
angle discussion above: W = 5000&nbsp; μm, dapt = 50&nbsp; μm, and 
rapt = 25&nbsp;μm. With these values we can calculate the surface 
area of the complete sphere as

<p>Unless you work with solid angle calculations on a regular 
basis, this value probably has little physical meaning to you, 
and you have no sense of how big or how small 78 microste-
radians are in real life. To provide some perspective, consider 
that both the Moon and the Sun subtend about this same 
solid angle when viewed from the surface of the Earth using 
the naked eye. The exact angular diameters (and therefore 
also the solid angles) of both the Sun and the Moon vary 
slightly during their orbits, depending on how far away they 
are at any given moment, but this variation is small and oscil-
lates around average values:

</p>
<p>sr.= 66 7.
</p>
<p>Of course the Sun is much, much larger than the Moon in 
diameter, but it is also much farther away, so the two celestial 
bodies appear to be about the same angular size from the per-
spective of the Earthbound viewer. This similarity in angular 
size is a coincidence, and it is the reason that during a solar 
eclipse that the Moon almost perfectly occludes the Sun for a 
short time. This analogy is instructive for the SEM operator 
because it helps explain how a small final beam aperture 
combined with a short working distance can produce the 
same convergence angle (and therefore depth of field) as a 
configuration that uses a large aperture and a long working 
distance. Likewise, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer 
(EDS detector) with a small area of 10&nbsp;mm2 can subtend the 
same solid angle (and therefore collect the same number of 
X-rays) as a much larger 100-mm2 detector sitting at a more 
distant detector-to-sample position.
</p>
<p>5.2.7  Electron Optical Brightness, β
</p>
<p>In practice the beam solid angle described in the previous 
section is an obscure and little-used parameter, and it is not 
that important for most SEM operators to understand fully. 
However, the concept of beam solid angle and the units of 
steradians affect the SEM operator much more directly 
through the concept of electron optical brightness, β. The 
main reason that field emission gun SEMs (FEG SEMs) enjoy 
drastically improved performance over SEMs that use therm-
ionic tungsten electron sources is because of the much larger 
electron optical brightness of the FEG electron source. 
Further, the brightness of the beam when it lands on the 
sample is the central mathematical variable in one of the key 
equations of SEM operation, the brightness equation. This 
equation relates the beam brightness to the beam diameter, 
the beam current, and the convergence angle, and it is an 
invaluable tool that lets the SEM operator predict and man-
age the tradeoff between probe size and beam current. 
</p>
<p> Chapter 5 &middot; Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Instrumentation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>Because of this central role in practical use of the SEM, it is 
worth struggling with the mathematics until you understand 
these concepts and can apply them in your work.
</p>
<p>Because the term brightness is used in everyday language, 
most people have an intuitive sense that if one source of 
energy (say, the Sun) is brighter than another source (say 
your flashlight or torch) then the brighter source is emitting 
&ldquo;more light.&rdquo; In other words, the flux is higher on the receiv-
ing end (i.e., at the sensor). Electron optical brightness is 
similar, but it is more precisely defined, considers current 
density instead of just total current, and factors in the change 
in angular divergence of the beam as it is focused or defo-
cused by the electron lenses in the SEM column. Using the 
terms and concept defined in the sections above, brightness 
can be succinctly defined as current density per unit solid 
angle, and it is measured in units of A m&minus;2 sr&minus;1 (i.e., amperes 
per square meter per steradian). Based on a quick analysis of 
the units, it becomes obvious that if two electron beams have 
exactly the same current and same beam diameter at their 
tightest focus (and therefore the same current density), but 
they have different convergence angles, the beam with the 
smaller convergence angle will have the higher brightness. 
This is a result of the sr&minus;1 term in the units, meaning the solid 
angle is in the denominator of the definition of brightness, 
and therefore larger solid angles result in smaller bright-
nesses (all other things being equal). In the case of visible 
light, this is why a 1-W laser is far &ldquo;brighter&rdquo; than a 200-W 
light bulb. This simultaneous dependence on current density 
and angular spread is also the reason for one of the most 
important properties of brightness as defined above: it is not 
changed as the electron beam is acted upon by the lenses in 
the SEM.&nbsp;In other words, to a very good approximation, the 
brightness of the electron beam is constant as it travels down 
the SEM from the electron source to the surface of the sam-
ple; and if you can estimate its value at one location along the 
beam you know it everywhere. One variable that does affect 
the brightness, however, is beam energy. In the SEM the 
brightness of all electron sources increases linearly with 
beam energy, and this change must be taken into account if 
you compare the brightness of beams at different energies.
</p>
<p> Brightness Equation
</p>
<p>One of the most valuable equations for understanding the 
behavior of electron beams in the SEM is the brightness 
equation, which relates the three parameters that define the 
beam:
</p>
<p>b
p a
</p>
<p>=
4
</p>
<p>2 2 2
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>d  
</p>
<p>(5.12)
</p>
<p>If you know the numerical value of the brightness of the 
beam, measured in A m&minus;2 sr&minus;1, then the brightness equation 
can provide a rough estimate of other parameters such as 
beam diameter, current, and convergence angle. This can be 
useful for explaining (quantitatively) the observed perfor-
mance increase of a FEG SEM over a thermionic instrument, 
</p>
<p>for example. However, even without knowing the numerical 
value of the brightness β, the functional form of the equation 
can provide very useful information about changes in the 
beam.
</p>
<p>Because the brightness, even if its value is unknown, is a 
constant and does not change as you change lens settings 
from one imaging condition to the next, the left-hand side of 
the equation is constant and has a fixed value. This implies 
the right-hand side of the equation is also fixed, so that any 
changes in one variable must be offset by equivalent changes 
in the other variables to maintain the constant value. The 
multiplier &ldquo;4&rdquo; in the numerator is a constant, as is π in the 
denominator. That means that the ratio of i to the product 
d2α2 is also constant. Note that the brightness equation con-
strains the selection of the beam parameters such that all 
three parameters cannot be independently chosen. For 
example, this means that if the current i is increased by a fac-
tor of 9 but the convergence angle is unchanged, the beam 
diameter will increase by a factor of 3 to maintain the equal-
ity. Alternatively, if the convergence angle is increased by a 
factor of 2 (say, by decreasing the working distance by mov-
ing the sample closer to the objective lens) then the current 
can be increased by a factor of 4 without changing the beam 
size. Even more complex changes in the beam parameters 
can be understood and predicted in this way, so careful study 
of this equation and its implications will pay many dividends 
during your study of the SEM.
</p>
<p>5.2.8  Focus
</p>
<p>One of the first skills taught to new SEM operators is how to 
focus the image of the sample. From a practical perspective, 
all that is required is to observe the image produced by the 
SEM, and adjust the focus setting on the microscope until the 
image appears sharp (not blurry) and contains as much fine 
detail as possible. From the perspective of electron optics, it 
is not quite as straightforward to understand what happens 
during the focusing operation, especially if you remember 
that the SEM image is not formed using the action of a lens as 
would be the case in a light microscope, but rather by raster-
ing a conical beam across the surface of the sample. 
. Figure&nbsp;5.5 shows the three basic focus conditions: overfo-
cus, correct focus, and underfocus.
</p>
<p>In the SEM the focus of the microscope is changed by 
altering the electrical current in the objective lens, which is 
almost always a round, electromagnetic lens. The larger the 
electrical current supplied to the objective lens, the more 
strongly it is excited and the stronger its magnetic field. This 
high magnetic field produces a large deflection in the elec-
trons passing through the lens, causing the beam to be 
focused more strongly, so that the beam converges to cross-
over quickly after leaving the lens and entering the SEM 
chamber. In other words, a strongly excited objective lens has 
a shorter focal length than a weakly excited lens. On the left 
in . Fig.&nbsp; 5.5, a strongly excited objective lens (short focal

<p>72
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>length) causes the beam to converge to focus before the elec-
trons reach the surface of the sample. Since the electrons then 
begin to diverge from this crossover point, the beam has 
broadened beyond its narrowest waist and is wider than opti-
mal when it strikes the surface of the sample, thus producing 
an out-of-focus image. Conversely, the right-hand portion of 
. Fig.&nbsp;5.5 shows the beam behavior in an underfocused con-
dition. Here the magnetic field is too weak, and the beam is 
not fully brought to crossover before it strikes the surface of 
the sample, and again the beam diameter is broader than 
optimal, resulting in an out-of-focus image.
</p>
<p>Using these schematics as a guide, it is easier to under-
stand what is happening electron optically when the SEM 
user focuses the image. Changes in the focus control result 
in changes in the electrical current in the objective lens, 
which results in raising or lowering the crossover of the elec-
tron beam relative to the surface of the sample. The distance 
between the objective lens exit aperture and this beam cross-
over point is displayed on the microscope as the working 
distance, W. On most microscopes you can see the working 
distance change numerically on the screen as you make 
gross changes in the focus setting, reflecting this vertical 
motion of the beam crossover in the SEM chamber. It is 
important to note that the term working distance is also used 
by some microscopists when referring to the distance 
between the objective lens pole piece and the surface of the 
sample. The value of W displayed on the microscope will 
accurately reflect this lens-to-sample distance if the sample 
is in focus.
</p>
<p> Astigmatism
</p>
<p>The pointy cones drawn in . Fig.&nbsp;5.5 are a useful fiction for 
representing the large-scale behavior of a focused electron 
beam, but if we consider the beam shape carefully near the 
beam crossover point this conical model of the beam breaks 
down. . Figure&nbsp; 5.6 is a more realistic picture of the beam 
shape as it converges to its narrowest point and then begins 
to diverge again below that plane. For a variety of reasons, 
mostly the effects of lens aberrations and other imperfec-
tions, even at its narrowest point the beam retains a finite 
beam diameter. In other words, it can never be focused to a 
perfect geometrical point. The left side of . Fig.&nbsp;5.6 shows the 
beam narrowing gently but never reaching a sharp point, 
reflecting this reality. Ideally, cross sections through the beam 
at different heights will all be circles, as shown in the right of 
. Fig.&nbsp; 5.6. If the beam is underfocused or overfocused, as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;5.5, the consequence is a blurry image caused 
by the larger-diameter beam (larger blue circles in . Fig.&nbsp;5.6 
above and below the narrowest point).
</p>
<p>In real SEMs the magnetic fields created in the electron 
optics are never perfectly symmetric. Although the 
 manufacturers strive for ideal circular symmetry in round 
lenses, invariably there are defects in the lens yoke, the elec-
trical windings, the machining of the pole pieces, or other 
problems that lead to asymmetries in the lens field and ulti-
mately to distortions in the electron beam. Dirt or contami-
nation buildup on the apertures in the microscope can also 
be an important source of distorted beam shapes. Since the 
dirt on the aperture is electrically non-conductive, it can

</p>
<p>accumulate an electric charge when the beam electrons strike 
it, and the resulting electrostatic fields can warp and bend the 
beam into odd and complex shapes that no longer have a cir-
cular cross section.
</p>
<p>By far the most important of these distortions is called 
two-fold astigmatism, which in practice is often referred to 
just as astigmatism. In this specific distortion the magnetic 
field that focuses the electrons is stronger in one direction 
than in the orthogonal direction, resulting in a beam with an 
elliptical cross section instead of a circular one. In beams 
exhibiting astigmatism the electrons come to closest focus in 
the x-direction at a different height than the y-direction, con-
sistent with the formation of elliptical cross sections. These 
effects are shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp; 5.7. Similar to 
. Fig.&nbsp;5.6, the focused beam is shown in perspective on the 
left side of the diagram, while a series of cross sections of the 
beam are shown on the right of the figure. In the case shown 
here, as the beam moves down the optical axis of the SEM, the 
</p>
<p>cross section changes from an elongated ellipse with long axis 
in the y-direction, to a circle (albeit with a larger diameter 
than the equivalent circle in . Fig.&nbsp;5.6), and then to another 
elongated ellipse, but this time with its long axis oriented in 
the x-direction. This progression from a near-line-focus to a 
broader circular focus and then to a near-line-focus in an 
orthogonal direction is the hallmark of a beam exhibiting 
astigmatism.
</p>
<p>This behavior is also easily visible in the images produced 
by rastering the beam on a sample. When the beam cross sec-
tion is highly elongated at the surface of the sample, the 
image resolution is degraded badly in one direction, produc-
ing a blurring effect with pronounced linear asymmetry. It 
appears as if the image detail is sheared or stretched in one 
direction but not the other. If the focus knob is adjusted when 
the beam is astigmatic, a point can be reached when this 
image shearing or linear asymmetry is eliminated or at least 
greatly reduced. This is the best focus obtainable without

<p>correcting the astigmatism, although it generally produces 
an image that is far inferior to the in-focus images obtainable 
with a properly stigmated beam. If the focus is further 
adjusted, past this point of symmetry, the image will again 
exhibit large amounts of shearing and stretching of the fine 
details, but in a different direction. This sequence of effects 
can be seen in . Fig.&nbsp;5.8. In . Fig.&nbsp;5.8a the sample is shown

<p>of the electron beam is approximately circular. . Figure&nbsp;5.9 
shows the sample field of view seen in . Fig.&nbsp;5.8, but imaged 
using a beam with pronounced astigmatism in the Y direc-
tion. In general the SEM beam will be astigmatic in both X 
and Y, and the operator must correct this beam distortion 
along both axes using the X and Y stigmators. When this is 
</p>
<p>performed correctly, a series of image like those in . Fig.&nbsp;5.10 
can be obtained. In . Fig.&nbsp;5.10, both overfocused and under-
focused images show loss of fine detail, but no directional 
distortion is present. The other significant improvement in 
. Fig.&nbsp;5.10c over . Figs.&nbsp;5.8c and 5.9c is that the best-focus 
image is much sharper when the image is properly stigmated. 
While this last benefit is the real reason to master the art of 
image stigmation, the characteristic appearance of images 
like those in . Figs.&nbsp;5.8a, b and 5.9a, b are very handy when 
adjusting the stigmation controls on the microscope.
</p>
<p>Learning how to properly adjust the stigmation coils on an 
SEM can be one of the most challenging and frustrating skills 
to develop when first learning to use the instrument. However, 
as can be seen in the previous figures, being able to quickly and 
accurately minimize astigmatism in your electron micrographs 
is an essential milestone along the journey to becoming an 
expert scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalyst.
</p>
<p>5.3  SEM Imaging Modes
</p>
<p>SEMs are very flexible instruments, and the SEM operator has 
control over a large number of electron beam, detector, and 
stage parameters. Consequently, the number of different imag-
ing conditions that may be employed to analyze any given sam-
ple is nearly infinite, and it is the job of the analyst to choose 
these conditions wisely to obtain useful information to meet 
the needs of the analysis. Fortunately, in many situations these 
choices can be narrowed to using one of the four basic modes of 
SEM operation: (1) High Depth-of-Field Mode, (2) Resolution 
Mode, (3) High-Current Mode, and (4) Low-Voltage Mode.
</p>
<p>Below you will find practical information on how to con-
trol the fundamental electron optical parameters described 
earlier in the text and specific guidance for operating the 
SEM in the four basic modes just mentioned. Experienced 
SEM operators will have mastered these four modes and will 
be comfortable moving between them as needed. Choosing 
any one of these modes is a compromise, since each of them 
sacrifices microscope performance in some areas to achieve 
other imaging goals. Appreciating the strengths and weak-
nesses of each mode is essential to understanding when each 
mode is warranted. Of course some analyses will demand 
imaging conditions that do not fall neatly into one of these 
four basic modes, and the expert SEM operator will use the 
full flexibility of the instrument when required.
</p>
<p>5.3.1  High Depth-of-Field Mode
</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with compound light microscopes (LMs) 
understands that they have a very limited Depth-of-Field 
(DoF), meaning there is a limited range of vertical heights on 
the sample surface that will all appear to be in focus simul-
taneously. Parts of the sample that fall outside this range 
appear blurry. One of the advantages of the SEM over the 
light microscope is that it is capable of a much deeper depth-
of- field than the LM.

</p>
<p>The shallow depth-of-field in the LM arises from the 
properties of its glass lenses, but SEMs don&rsquo;t use lenses to 
form direct images; instead they rely on lenses to focus the 
beam and then scan this beam from pixel to pixel to image 
the sample.1 Nonetheless, they suffer from limited DoF 
because of the effect shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp; 5.11. 
Here the electron beam is shown striking the sample in 
three different locations, producing three different pixels in 
the image. For all three pixels the vertical position of the 
electron beam crossover is the same; this height is called the 
plane of optimum focus and is represented in . Fig.&nbsp;5.11 as 
a horizontal green dot-dashed line. For the case of pixel 2, 
this plane coincides with the surface of the sample. For pixel 
1, the electron beam has not yet reached crossover when it 
</p>
<p>1 Glass lenses and transmission electron microscope lenses also 
</p>
<p>have a related property known as depth-of-focus, a term that is 
</p>
<p>often confused with depth-of-field. Depth-of-field refers to the 
</p>
<p>range of heights in simultaneous focus on the sample (i.e., the 
</p>
<p>observed field). In contrast, depth-of-focus refers to the range of 
</p>
<p>positions near the imaging plane of the lens where the image is in 
</p>
<p>focus. This determines, for example, how far away from the ideal 
</p>
<p>imaging plane of the lens you can place a piece of film, or a CCD 
</p>
<p>detector, and still capture an in-focus image. Because SEMs 
</p>
<p>capture images via scanning action, the term depth-of-focus is not 
</p>
<p>relevant.
</p>
<p>strikes the surface of the sample, at a height denoted by the 
upper red dotted line. This is equivalent to underfocusing 
the beam, with the same effect: the diameter of the probe at 
the sample surface is larger than optimal. If this increase in 
probe size is large enough, it will degrade the sharpness of 
the image. The height at which this blurring becomes mea-
sureable, denoted by the upper red dotted line, is the upper 
limit of the DoF for this beam. Similarly, for pixel 3 the 
sample surface is lower (i.e., further from the objective lens) 
than the middle case. This is analogous to overfocus because 
the beam comes to crossover and begins to diverge again 
before it lands on the sample. As before, this can degrade the 
sharpness of the image, and the height at which this degra-
dation is noticeable is the lower limit of the height range that 
defines the DoF.&nbsp;The distance between these two dotted red 
lines is labeled Df in . Fig.&nbsp;5.11, denoting the depth-of-field.
</p>
<p>Because the definition of DoF requires the resulting blur 
to be noticeable (or at least measureable), it depends on many 
factors and can be somewhat subjective. For example, since 
in most cases sub-pixel blurring is not a concern to the SEM 
analyst, the effective DoF will often improve as the magnifi-
cation decreases and the pixel size increases. However, as the 
magnification decreases, much more of the sample is visible 
in the field of view, increasing the chances that pronounced 
topography will lead to blurring. In these cases the DoF is

</p>
<p>still increased at low magnification, but parts of the sample 
are still blurred in the image because of the large range of 
height visible in the expanded field of view. Nonetheless, 
operating the SEM in High Depth-of-Field Mode at medium 
to low magnifications is perhaps the most often used imaging 
condition for routine SEM work.
</p>
<p>The basic idea behind High Depth-of-Field Mode is to 
create a set of imaging conditions where the convergence 
angle of the beam is small, producing a narrow pencil-like 
electron beam that does not change diameter rapidly with 
height above the sample. . Figure&nbsp;5.12 shows what this looks 
like schematically. . Figure&nbsp;5.12a represents typical imaging 
conditions, with short working distance W and normal aper-
ture diameter. . Figure&nbsp;5.12b shows the imaging conditions 
used in High Depth-of-Field Mode, where the working dis-
tance has been increased significantly and a smaller diameter 
aperture is inserted. These two changes decrease the conver-
gence angle of the electron beam and therefore increase the 
DoF.&nbsp; The effects of the aperture and working distance are 
independent of each other, meaning either one can improve 
the depth-of-field by itself.
</p>
<p>For best results in Depth-of-Field Mode, determine the 
lowest stage position available (largest working distance), 
and drive the sample to that location. Changing the working 
distance is straightforward on most SEMs. Those micro-
scopes with a manual stage will often have a physical knob on 
the chamber door for changing the height of the sample. 
Motorized stages are sometimes controlled by a hand panel, 
</p>
<p>joystick, or stand-alone stage controller, especially on older 
microscopes. Recent models typically use a graphical user 
interface, requiring the operator to enter a destination height 
(or &ldquo;Z position&rdquo;) in millimeters and then executing the move. 
Some also allow the stage height to be changed continuously 
using the mouse.
</p>
<p>Depth-of-Field Mode is also optimized by selecting a 
relatively small final beam aperture. The mechanisms used 
to change the diameter of the final aperture, and to center it 
on the optical axis of the microscope, vary widely from one 
SEM model to the next. In fact, some SEMs are designed to 
use a fixed or semi-fixed final aperture and do not provide an 
easy method of altering the aperture size. Many microscopes 
have manual aperture controls mounted on the outside of 
the SEM column (. Fig.&nbsp; 5.13). Other microscopes use a 
graphical user interface (GUI) to allow the operator to select 
one of several available apertures for insertion. Following 
this selection, motors driven by an X/Y- motion controller 
physically move the selected aperture into place and recall 
from memory the X- and Y- positions needed to center it. In 
either case the apertures themselves are arrayed linearly as a 
series of circular holes in a long, thin aperture strip.
</p>
<p>A few microscopes permit you to configure Depth-of- 
Field Mode directly by selecting this option in the instrument 
control software. . Figure&nbsp;5.14 shows an example screenshot 
from one manufacturer&rsquo;s user interface where the operator 
can select a dedicated &ldquo;DEPTH&rdquo; setting, automatically opti-
mizing the instrument for a small convergence angle.

<p>5.3.2  High-Current Mode
</p>
<p>Like the High Depth-of-Field Mode described above, the 
High-Current Mode of operating the SEM is used frequently. 
In many common imaging situations it delivers excellent fea-
ture visibility, useful and informative materials contrast, and 
adequate resolution and depth-of-field . It is particularly use-
ful when the native contrast of the sample is low, such as when 
neighboring materials phases exhibit approximately equal 
average atomic number. It is also invaluable when performing 
X-ray microanalysis since the higher beam current translates 
directly into higher X-ray count rates. This can help by short-
ening the acquisition time needed to acquire individual X-ray 
spectra with an adequate number of counts for quantitative 
analysis, but it is even more important when acquiring X-ray 
maps or spectrum image datasets with full spectra at every 
spatial pixel. In all the cases mentioned above, feature visibil-
ity and count rate (both enabled by high current) are more 
important than spatial resolution or depth- of- field .
</p>
<p>The basic idea behind High-Current Mode is to increase 
the current in the probe to boost both the signal reaching the 
detectors and the signal-to-noise ratio. Regardless of the 
electron detector in use (e.g., Everhart&ndash;Thornley detector, 
dedicated backscatter detector, through-the-lens detector, 
etc.), the signal reaching the detector scales with the signal 
generated at the sample, and this in turn scale directly with 
the current in the electron probe.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the controls used to vary the electron 
beam current vary widely from one SEM model to the next, 
and different SEM manufacturers use discordant or conflict-
ing terminology to describe these controls. As dictated by the 
brightness equation, the probe diameter must increase with 
an increase in probe current, so some manufacturers call the 
control &ldquo;Spot Size.&rdquo; On some microscopes Spot Size 1 is a 
small spot (corresponding to a low beam current) and Spot 
Size 10 is a large spot (high current); a different vendor, how-
ever, may have adopted the convention where Spot Size 1 is a 
large spot and Spot Size 10 is a small spot. Other companies 
use the term Spot Size, but specify it in nanometers in an 
attempt to represent the nominal diameter of the probe. An 
approach growing in popularity with more modern instru-
ments is to allow the operator to set the nominal probe cur-
rent itself instead of Spot Size. As discussed above, this can be 
done either in discrete steps or continuously. In either case, 
the current steps can be labeled with arbitrary numbers (e.g., 
7), they can reflect the nominal probe current (e.g., 100 pA), 
or sometimes they are specified as a percentage of the maxi-
mum current (e.g., 30 %). This dizzying variety of methods 
for labeling the desired probe current on SEMs can be con-
fusing when switching from one instrument to another.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp; 5.15 shows two different varieties of physical 
knob configuration that might be encountered on the control 
panel of SEMs and electron probe microanalyzers (EPMAs). 
These analog controls are very intuitive to use because turning 
the knob changes the beam current in an immediate and con-
tinuous manner, allowing fine control of this parameter. Large

</p>
<p>changes in beam current can be made quickly by using the 
coarse setting of the knob shown in . Fig.&nbsp;5.15a, or the coarse 
knob shown in . Fig.&nbsp;5.15b. In both cases fine control is also 
possible for smaller adjustments. . Figure&nbsp; 5.16 shows two 
examples of computer-based beam current controls of the type 
found in graphical user interfaces. In both cases the operator 
can change the beam current using the mouse and keyboard. 
In . Fig.&nbsp;5.16a this can be accomplished either by entering an 
exact digital value for the beam current and clicking the &ldquo;Set&rdquo; 
button, by dragging one of the two the slider controls to the left 
or right, or by clicking the arrow buttons to increase to decrease 
the current setting. Note that on this microscope, the slider 
positions are expressed digitally using arbitrary units (58 units 
for the coarse slider and 331 units for the fine slider). While 
these numbers are not true current values, these arbitrary set-
tings can be useful for returning the microscope to a specific 
current. . Figure&nbsp;5.16b shows a similar GUI window from the 
</p>
<p>user interface written by a different manufacturer. In this case, 
the operator also has access to a numerical beam current set-
ting, nominally calibrated in true current measured in pA, as 
well as buttons that when clicked will increase or decrease the 
beam current incrementally. Finally, . Fig.&nbsp;5.17 shows screen-
shots from a graphical user interface based on Spot Size instead 
of beam current. The operator is asked to select a specific Spot 
Size using a quick access pull-down menu (. Fig.&nbsp;5.17a) or a 
more flexible combination of a pull-down menu and up/down 
buttons (. Fig.&nbsp;5.17b). While these figures provide a sampling 
of the large variety of terms and interface layouts that the oper-
ator might encounter in the field, there are many more varia-
tions in practice than can be shown here.
</p>
<p>Regardless of how any given SEM allows the operator to 
change the probe current, the most important tasks for the 
operator are to know how to increase and decrease current, 
and how to measure the current accurately once set. Even on 
those instruments that let the operator select a numerical 
probe current (e.g., 1&nbsp;nA) via the user interface, it is unwise

<p>to assume this setting will reliably produce the displayed 
value. Well-equipped SEMs have a built-in picoammeter that 
can be automatically inserted into the beam path to measure 
probe current. Getting a reading in these cases is as simple as 
triggering the insertion of the meter&rsquo;s cup and reading the 
value off the screen. Alternatively, a stage-mounted Faraday 
cup (either purchased commercially or homemade) attached 
through an electrical feedthrough to a benchtop picoamme-
ter can be used instead.
</p>
<p>Since the basic idea of High-Current Mode is to deliver 
sufficient probe current to the sample to generate superior 
signal-to-noise ratio, optimum results are obtained at 
medium to low magnifications, and often a larger final aper-
ture is useful. Frame the field-of-view desired, focus the 
beam, and increase probe current until high-quality images 
can be obtained within a relatively short frame time, say, a 
few seconds to a minute. Check that any low-contrast fea-
tures needed for analysis are sufficiently visible, and increase 
probe current further if they are not. For many situations, 
this high-current imaging approach will yield excellent 
images quickly and with little wasted time. If you are per-
forming X-ray microanalysis, the approach to High-Current 
Mode is very similar to that for imaging, but the choice of 
current is dictated not by image quality but by X-ray count 
rate or, more suitably, the dead time percentage of the X-ray 
spectrometer&rsquo;s pulse processor.
</p>
<p>5.3.3  Resolution Mode
</p>
<p>Resolution Mode is probably the most demanding of the four 
basic SEM operational modes, chiefly because the micro-
scope is driven at or near its limits of performance. It chal-
lenges the operator mentally, since choosing optimum 
imaging parameters requires deeper knowledge of electron 
optics and the physics of electron beams, although suitable 
images can be obtained with a basic understanding of the 
principles. It also demands more skill in operating the micro-
scope, since small misalignments (e.g., residual stigmatism, 
imperfectly centered aperture) are more apparent. In fact, 
good alignment of the entire column is necessary to get the 
best resolution from the scope, while small misalignments 
are often tolerated in High-Current or High Depth-of-Field 
Mode. Resolution Mode also expects more from the micro-
scope&rsquo;s environment. Mechanical vibrations, electronic noise, 
and AC magnetic fields near the microscope are some of the 
many sources of image degradation that, while generally 
unnoticeable, become obvious when operating in Resolution 
Mode. Poor sample preparation, such as overly thick evapo-
rated metal coatings or insufficient metallographic polishing, 
for example, is also more evident at high magnifications. 
Most of these challenges are greatly reduced at lower magni-
fications, but the larger pixel sizes that result from low mag-
nification obviate the need for Resolution Mode. In short, the 
same imaging conditions that enable Resolution Mode also 
highlight any shortcomings in the operator&rsquo;s technique, the 
laboratory environment, and the sample preparation.

</p>
<p>Although every one of the basic SEM operational modes 
requires some compromise, in Resolution Mode the pursuit of 
high spatial resolution often involves compromise across the 
board. Small probe diameters require very low beam currents, 
thereby reducing the signal generated and lengthening the 
frame times needed. Depth-of-field is also reduced, although 
this is often not noticeable at high magnification, and detector 
choice is usually limited to the one or two channels optimized 
for this purpose (e.g., through-the-lens detectors).
</p>
<p>The basic idea in Resolution Mode is to (1) minimize the 
probe diameter by raising the beam energy and reducing the 
beam current, (2) emphasize the collection of the resolution- 
preserving SE1 secondary electrons generated at the beam foot-
print, and (3) minimize the myriad sources of image 
degradation by using the shortest working distance possible. 
Raising the beam energy helps produce smaller probe sizes 
because it increases the brightness of the gun. For thin samples, 
such as small particles sitting on an ultrathin film substrate, this 
produces the highest resolution. Likewise for very high-Z sam-
ples, even high landing energies have short electron ranges and 
therefore small excitation volumes. However, for thick samples 
with low atomic number, better resolution may be obtained at 
lower landing energies if the size of the excitation volume is the 
limiting factor. For any given beam energy, smaller currents 
always yield smaller probe sizes, as demanded by the brightness 
equation, so operating at tens of picoamps is not uncommon in 
this mode. Choice of signal carrier and detector can be crucial 
for obtaining high spatial resolution. Since backscattered elec-
trons emerge from a disc comparable in size to the electron 
range, it is very hard to realize high resolution by using back-
scattered electrons (BSE) directly or BSE-generated secondar-
ies such as SE2 secondary electrons (generated at the sample 
surface by emerging BSE) or SE3 secondary electrons (gener-
ated at great distance from the sample by BSE that strike micro-
scope components). The highest resolution is obtained from 
SE1 secondary electrons, because these emerge from the very 
narrow electron probe footprint on the sample surface, compa-
rable in diameter to the probe itself. Microscopes equipped 
with immersion objective lenses or snorkel lenses and through- 
the- lens detectors (TTLs) are best at efficient collection of SE1 
electrons. Finally, bringing the sample very close to the objec-
tive lens, even less than 1&nbsp;mm if practical, can improve resolu-
tion significantly. SE1 collection is maximized by this proximity, 
and a short working distance (WD) can minimize the length 
over which beam perturbations such as AC fields can act.
</p>
<p>The practical steps needed to configure the SEM for opera-
tion in Resolution Mode follow from the basic requirements 
outlined above. Get the sample as close to the objective lens as 
possible by carefully shortening the working distance. 
Computer-controlled SEMs will frequently have a software 
interlock designed to reduce the chances that the sample will 
physically impact the pole piece. Learn how this feature func-
tions and use it effectively but carefully; high resolution is use-
ful, but a scratched or dented pole piece can be a very expensive 
mistake! Also, beware that many microscopes possess more 
than one objective lens mode. Invariably the lens mode 
needed for best resolution will be the one that creates the 
</p>
<p>highest magnetic field at the sample. Coupled with the prox-
imity of a short working distance, these high magnetic field 
modes may lift your sample off the stage unless it consists of a 
non-magnetic material. Select the TTL detector if available, or 
other detector that preferentially utilizes SE1 secondary elec-
trons for imaging. Increase the accelerating voltage on the 
SEM to its highest setting, usually 30&nbsp;kV or higher, and reduce 
the beam current to as low a value as practical while still main-
taining visibility of the sample as noise increases. Moving to a 
slower frame time, longer dwell time, or enabling frame aver-
aging will help mitigate the effects of reduced signal at low 
probe currents. Finally, select the optimal objective lens aper-
ture diameter for best resolution. This can be tricky because of 
competing effects. Small apertures can limit the resolution 
due to diffraction effects, so the larger the aperture the less 
likely that these effects will be a problem. However, large aper-
tures quickly amplify the effects of objective lens aberrations, 
especially spherical aberration, so the smallest aperture size 
available is ideal for reduction of aberrations. Clearly these 
requirements conflict with one another, and every objective 
lens has an intermediate aperture diameter that delivers the 
best resolution for any given beam energy and working dis-
tance. Some SEMs inform the operator of this optimal aper-
ture size, while others are less helpful and leave it up to the 
operator to determine the best choice. In these cases, contact 
the SEM manufacturer&rsquo;s application engineer for advice or test 
a variety of aperture diameters on high quality imaging test 
specimens to understand how to manage this tradeoff.
</p>
<p>5.3.4  Low-Voltage Mode
</p>
<p>Of the four basic SEM modes, Low-Voltage Mode is probably 
the most esoteric and challenging, regarding both instru-
mentation and specimen issues. Reducing the landing energy 
of the beam is useful in many situations, and varying the 
beam energy should be considered when operating in High- 
Current Mode or Depth-of-Field Mode as needed. However, 
operating with landing energies below 5&nbsp;keV, and especially 
below 1&nbsp;keV, is qualitatively different than using higher ener-
gies. The performance of the SEM&rsquo;s entire electron optical 
chain, from the electron gun to the objective lens, is much 
worse at 1&nbsp; keV than at high beam energy. While modern 
thermionic SEMs are often quite good performers in Low- 
Voltage Mode, not many years ago a field emission electron 
source (FEG) was considered a de facto requirement for low 
voltage work, and most older thermionic SEMs produce such 
poor images at 1&nbsp;keV that they are almost useless.
</p>
<p>For all electron sources the gun&rsquo;s brightness will be much 
lower at 1&nbsp;keV than at 30&nbsp;keV, which limits the current density 
in the probe because of the brightness equation. This in turn 
means the operator must work at much larger probe sizes to 
obtain sufficient current for imaging. Here field emission 
sources have a big advantage over tungsten or LaB6 therm-
ionic filaments because they are much brighter intrinsically, 
and so remain bright enough at low voltage for decent imag-
ing. Another important concern that arises at these low beam 
</p>
<p>5.3 &middot; SEM Imaging Modes</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>82
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>energies is the chromatic aberration of the objective lens. This 
aberration causes beam electrons at different energies to be 
focused in different planes, reducing the current density. 
Although this aberration is a flaw in the lens itself and not the 
electrons in the beam, lower beam energies make the problem 
more apparent, in part because they have a larger fractional 
energy spread. In fact, the effects of this aberration would not 
be noticeable at all in a monochromatic electron beam, where 
all the electrons have exactly the same energy. Similarly, elec-
tron sources with naturally narrow energy spreads, such as 
cold field emission sources, suffer from these problems much 
less than sources with large energy spreads like thermionic 
guns. Whatever their cause, these reductions in image quality, 
both lower resolution and lower current density, explain why 
Low-Voltage Mode is commonly employed at low magnifica-
tions. Operators with expensive, high-performing field emis-
sion microscopes designed for low voltage operation will be 
able to work at low voltage and high magnification&mdash;even 
more so if the microscope is equipped with a beam mono-
chromator, an accessory designed to artificially narrow the 
energy spread of the electron beam, thus reducing the effect 
of chromatic aberration even at very high magnifications.
</p>
<p>Another unwanted consequence of using very low beam 
energies is that the resulting electron trajectories are less 
&ldquo;stiff,&rdquo; meaning the electrons are more easily deflected from 
their intended paths by stray electric or magnetic fields near 
the beam. At 1&nbsp;keV landing energy and below, the electrons 
are moving relatively slowly and are more susceptible to elec-
trical charging in the sample, AC electric or magnetic fields 
in the microscope room, and electrical noise on the micro-
scope&rsquo;s scan coils. These are some of the many challenges of 
imaging in Low-Voltage Mode.
</p>
<p>The main advantages of Low-Voltage Mode are the much- 
reduced excitation volume and the resulting change in contrast 
for most sample materials. The range of primary beam elec-
trons in most materials drops very rapidly as the landing 
energy is reduced, so the region in the sample emitting signal- 
carrying electrons can be very small, improving resolution in 
cases where it is limited by this range. The resulting surface 
sensitivity of the signal also tends to flatten the image contrast 
and it de-emphasizes materials contrast in favor of topography. 
Because the view of the sample in Low-Voltage Mode is often 
dramatically different than the equivalent image at normal 
beam energy, this mode often reveals important features in the 
sample that might be missed using routine imaging conditions.
</p>
<p>It is possible to perform X-ray microanalysis at low volt-
age, but it presents special challenges and should not be 
attempted unless it is unavoidable. The very short electron 
range means the X-rays produced in the sample are gener-
ated close to the surface and very near the beam impact 
point. This is a good thing, because both lateral and depth 
resolution are improved, and absorption losses are reduced 
for outgoing X-rays. However, the low landing energies 
severely limit the number of X-ray lines that are efficiently 
excited, and many elements are either inaccessible, or the 
analyst is forced to use M- or N-shell lines with poorly mea-
sured cross sections or absorption coefficients. Complicating 
</p>
<p>matters further, the reduced brightness at low voltage means 
probe currents are low and X-ray count rates can be anemic.
</p>
<p>The basic idea behind low voltage mode is simple: reduce 
the landing energy of the beam. The practical advice for con-
figuring this mode is equally straightforward, since changing 
the beam energy on most microscopes is controlled by a 
dedicated knob or can be achieved by selecting the desired 
energy on a graphical user interface. . Figure&nbsp;5.18 shows two 
examples of GUI controls from different instruments. In 
screenshots the controls are expressed in accelerating voltage 
measured in kV; this is equivalent to controlling the beam 
energy in keV.

</p>
<p>In some cases the SEM may allow the operator to apply a 
sample bias or use another form of beam deceleration, thus 
permitting the electron landing energy to differ from the 
beam energy. In these situations the manufacturer&rsquo;s instru-
ment manual should be consulted for exact configuration 
guidance, and it is important to remember that it is the land-
ing energy (not the energy of the beam as it leaves the objec-
tive lens) that governs both the electron range and the X-ray 
generation physics.
</p>
<p>5.4  Electron Detectors
</p>
<p>The SEM is equipped with one or more detectors that are 
sensitive to BSE, SE, or a combination of BSE and SE that 
emerge from the specimen as a result of the interaction of the 
primary electron beam. By measuring the response of BSE 
and SE as a function of beam location, various properties of 
the specimen, including composition, thickness, topography, 
crystallographic orientation, and magnetic and electrical 
fields, can be revealed in SEM images.
</p>
<p>5.4.1  Important Properties of&nbsp;BSE and&nbsp;SE 
for&nbsp;Detector Design and&nbsp;Operation
</p>
<p> Abundance
</p>
<p>The total yield per incident beam electron of BSE or SE is 
sensitive to specimen properties such as the average atomic 
number (BSE), the chemical state (SE), local specimen incli-
nation (BSE and SE), crystallographic orientation (BSE), and 
local magnetic field (BSE and SE). However, the total elec-
tron signal is not what is measured by most electron detec-
tors in common use for SEM imaging. The actual response of 
a particular detector is further complicated by its limited 
angular range of acceptance as well as its sensitivity to the 
energy of the electrons being detected. The only detector 
which is exclusively sensitive to the number of BSE and/or SE 
(and not emitted trajectory or energy distributions) is the 
specimen itself when the specimen current is used as an 
imaging signal.
</p>
<p> Angular Distribution
</p>
<p>Knowledge of the trajectories of BSE and SE after leaving the 
specimen is important for placing a detector to intercept the 
useful signals. For a beam incident perpendicularly to a sur-
face (i.e., the beam is parallel to the normal to the surface), 
BSE and SE are emitted with the same angular distribution 
which approximately follows the cosine function: the relative 
abundance along any direction is proportional to the cosine 
of the angle between the surface normal and that direction. 
Thus, the most abundant emission is along the direction par-
allel to the surface normal (i.e., back along the beam, where 
the angle = 0&deg; and cos 0&deg; = 1.0), while relatively few BSE or SE 
are emitted close to the surface (e.g., along a direction 1&deg; 
above the surface is 89&deg; from the surface normal, cos 
89&deg; = 0.017, so that only 1.7 % is emitted compared to the 
</p>
<p>intensity emitted back along the beam). When a surface is 
highly inclined to the beam, the angular distribution of the 
SE still follows the cosine distribution, but the BSE follow a 
distribution that becomes progressively more asymmetric 
with tilt and is peaked in the forward (down slope) direction. 
For local surface inclinations above approximately 45&deg;, the 
most likely direction of BSE emission is at an angle above the 
surface that is similar to the beam incidence angle above the 
surface. The directionality of BSE emission becomes more 
strongly peaked as the inclination further increases.
</p>
<p> Kinetic Energy Response
</p>
<p>BSE and SE have sharply differing kinetic energies. BSE 
retain a significant fraction of the incident energy of the 
beam electrons from which they originate, with typically 
more than 50 % of the BSE escaping while retaining more 
than 0.5 E0. The BSE coefficient, the relative abundance of 
energetic BSE, and the peak BSE energy all increase with the 
atomic number of the target. Thus, for an incident beam 
energy of E0 = 20&nbsp;keV, a large fraction of the BSE will escape 
with a kinetic energy of 10&nbsp;keV or more. By comparison, SE 
are much lower in kinetic energy, being emitted with less 
than 50&nbsp;eV (by arbitrary definition). In fact, most SE exit the 
specimen with less than 10&nbsp;eV, and the peak of the SE kinetic 
energy distribution is in the range 2 eV to 5 eV.&nbsp;Methods of 
detecting electrons include (1) charge generation during 
inelastic scattering of an energetic electron within semicon-
ductor devices and (2) scintillation, the emission of light 
when an energetic electron strikes a suitably sensitive mate-
rial, which includes inorganic compounds (e.g., CaF2 with a 
minor dopant of the rare earth element Eu), certain glasses 
incorporating rare earth elements, and organic compounds 
(e.g., certain plastics). Both charge generation in semicon-
ductors and scintillation require that electrons have elevated 
kinetic energy, typically above several kilo-electronvolts, to 
initiate the detection process, and the strength of the detec-
tion effect generally increases with increasing kinetic energy. 
Thus, most BSE produced by a beam in the conventional 
energy range of 10&ndash;30&nbsp; keV can be directly detected with 
semiconductor and scintillation detectors, while these same 
detectors are not sensitive to SE because of their much lower 
kinetic energy. To detect SE, post-specimen acceleration 
must be applied to boost the kinetic energy of SE into the 
detectable range.
</p>
<p>5.4.2  Detector Characteristics
</p>
<p> Angular Measures for&nbsp;Electron Detectors
</p>
<p>kKey Fact
</p>
<p>Knowledge of the location of electron detectors is critical for 
proper interpretation of SEM images, especially of topo-
graphic features. Apparent illumination in the SEM image 
appears to come from the detector, while the observer&rsquo;s view 
appears to be along the incident electron beam, as discussed 
in detail in the Image Formation module.

</p>
<p>Elevation (Take-Off) Angle, ψ, and&nbsp;Azimuthal 
</p>
<p>Angle, ζ
</p>
<p>The effective position of a detector is specified by two angles. 
The elevation (&ldquo;take-off&rdquo;) angle, designated ψ, is the angle 
above a horizontal plane perpendicular to the beam axis and 
the vector that joins the center of the detector to the beam 
impact position on the specimen, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;5.19a. 
(Alternatively, the take-off angle can be measured as the 
complement of the angle between the beam axis and a line 
perpendicular to the detector face extended to the beam optic 
axis.) The &ldquo;azimuthal angle,&rdquo; ζ, of the detector is the rotational 
angle around the beam to the detector line, measured relative 
to some arbitrary but fixed reference, such as the front face 
of the specimen chamber, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;5.19b. When an 
SEM image is created, it is critical for the user to understand 
the relative position of the detector in the scanned image, as 
given by the azimuthal angle, since the illumination of the 
image will apparently come from the detector. Note that the 
&ldquo;scan rotation&rdquo; function, which permits the user to arbi-
trarily choose the angular orientation for the presentation 
of the image on the display, also varies the apparent angular 
location of the detector. It is therefore critical for the user to 
establish what setting of scan rotation corresponds to the cor-
rect known value of the detector azimuthal angle.
</p>
<p>kGood Practice
</p>
<p>Make a drawing (top view and side view) of the SEM cham-
ber showing the physical locations of all detectors (electron, 
X-ray, and cathodoluminescence) and mark the values of the 
elevation angle, ψ, and azimuthal angle, ζ.
</p>
<p>Solid Angle, Ω
</p>
<p>As shown in . Fig.&nbsp;5.20, the effective size of the detector with 
an active area A placed at a distance r from the beam impact 
point on the specimen is given by the solid angle, Ω (Greek 
omega, upper case), which is defined as
</p>
<p>W = ( )A r/ ,2 steradians sr
 
</p>
<p>(5.13)
</p>
<p>Note the strong dependence of Ω upon the distance of the 
detector from the beam impact on the specimen.
</p>
<p>As an estimate of the overall geometric efficiency, ε, the 
solid angle of the detector can be compared to the solid angle 
of the hemisphere (2π sr) into which all electrons leaving a 
thick target are emitted:
</p>
<p>e W p= / 2
 
</p>
<p>(5.14)
</p>
<p>ε provides only an estimate of efficiency because the simple 
definition in Eq. (5.14) does not consider the non- uniform dis-
tribution in the emission of electrons from the specimen, for 
example, the cosine distribution of BSE at normal incidence.

</p>
<p> Energy Response
</p>
<p>The response of a detector may be sensitive to the kinetic 
energy of the striking electron. Generally an electron detec-
tor exhibits an energy threshold below which it has no 
response, usually a consequence of an insensitive surface 
layer such as a metallic coating, needed to dissipate charging, 
through which the incident electron must penetrate. Above 
this threshold, the detector response typically increases with 
increasing electron energy, making the detector output signal 
more sensitive to the high energy fraction of the electrons.
</p>
<p> Bandwidth
</p>
<p>The act of creating an SEM image involves scanning the beam 
in a time-serial fashion to dwell at a series of discrete beam 
locations (pixels) on the specimen, with the detector measur-
ing the signal of interest at each location. The signal stream 
can thus be thought of as changing with a maximum spatial 
frequency defined by the speed within which successive pix-
els are sampled. &ldquo;Bandwidth&rdquo; is a general term used to 
describe the range from the lowest to the maximum spatial 
frequency that can be measured and transmitted through the 
amplification system. To achieve sufficiently fast scanned 
imaging to create the illusion of a continuous image (&ldquo;flicker 
free&rdquo;) to a human observer, the imaging system must be 
capable of producing approximately 30 distinct image frames 
per second.
</p>
<p>Ideally, the measurements of successive pixel locations 
are independent, with the detector returning to its quiescent 
state before measuring the next pixel. In reality, detectors 
typically require a finite decay time to dissipate the electron 
charge accumulated before measuring the next pixel. Thus, as 
the scanning speed increases so that the time separation of 
the pixel samples decreases, a limit will eventually be reached 
where the detector retains a sufficiently high fraction of the 
signal from the previous pixel so as to interfere with the use-
ful measurement of the signal at the next pixel, producing a 
visible degradation of the image. When this situation occurs, 
the detector acts as a bandwidth-limiting device. For the dis-
cussion of detector performance characteristics below, detec-
tor bandwidth will be broadly classified as &ldquo;high&rdquo; (e.g., 
capable of achieving flicker-free imaging) or &ldquo;low&rdquo; (slow scan 
speeds required).
</p>
<p>5.4.3  Common Types of&nbsp;Electron Detectors
</p>
<p> Backscattered Electrons
</p>
<p>Passive Detectors
</p>
<p>Because a large fraction of the BSE emitted from the speci-
men under conventional operating conditions (E0 &gt; 5&nbsp; keV) 
retain 50 % or more of the incident energy, they can be 
detected with a passive detector that does not apply any post- 
specimen acceleration to the BSE.&nbsp;Passive detectors include 
scintillation-based detectors and semiconductor charge- 
deposition based detectors.
</p>
<p>Scintillation Detectors
</p>
<p>Energetic electrons that strike certain optically active materials 
cause the emission of light. Optical materials are selected that 
produce a high signal response that decays very rapidly, thus 
enabling high bandwidth operation. The emitted light is col-
lected and passed by total internal reflection through a light 
guide to a photomultiplier, where the light is converted into an 
electrical signal with very high gain and very rapid time decay, 
thus preserving the high bandwidth of the original detector 
signal. Depending on the design, scintillator detectors can vary 
widely in solid angle. . Figure&nbsp;5.21 shows a small solid-angle 
design consisting of a small area scintillator (e.g., A = 1&nbsp;cm2) on 
the tip of a light guide placed at a distance of 4&nbsp;cm from the 
beam impact, giving a solid angle of&nbsp;Ω = 0.0625&nbsp;sr and a geo-
metric efficiency of ε = 0.01 or 1 %. Both a high take-off angle 
and a low take-off angle arrangement are illustrated.
</p>
<p>kAdjustable Controls
</p>
<p>Passive BSE detectors on rigid light guides have no  
user- adjustable operating parameters. (In operation, the 
&ldquo;brightness&rdquo; and &ldquo;contrast&rdquo; parameters match the ampli-
fied signal from the detector photomultiplier to the accept-
able input range of the digitizer.) A passive BSE detector 
that employs a flexible light guide enables the microscopist 
to change the take-off angle, azimuthal angle, and the solid 
angle.
</p>
<p>Very large solid angle scintillator-BSE detectors are pos-
sible. An example of a large solid angle design is shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;5.22 that almost entirely surrounds the specimen with 
an aperture to permit the access of the beam. For a planar 
sample set normal to the beam, this detector spans a large 
range of take-off angles. The scintillator also serves as the 
light guide, so that a BSE that strikes anywhere on the detec-
tor surface can be detected. Due to its large area and close 
proximity to the specimen, the solid angle approaches 2π sr 
in size with a geometric efficiency greater than 90 % (Wells 
1957; Robinson 1975).

</p>
<p>kAdjustable Controls
</p>
<p>The Wells&ndash;Robinson scintillation BSE detector is often 
mounted on an externally controlled, motorized retractable 
arm. In typical use the detector would be fully inserted to 
maximize the solid angle. A partial insertion that does not 
interrupt the beam access to the specimen can be used to 
intentionally provide an asymmetric detector placement to 
give an apparent illumination from one side.
</p>
<p>Semiconductor BSE Detectors
</p>
<p>Certain semiconductor devices can detect energetic elec-
trons that penetrate into the active region of the device where 
they undergo inelastic scattering. One product of this energy 
deposition in the semiconductor is the promotion of loosely 
bound valence shell electrons (each leaving behind a vacancy 
or positively-charged &ldquo;hole&rdquo;) into the empty conduction 
band where they can freely move through the semiconduc-
tor in response to an applied potential bias. By applying a 
suitable electrical field, these free electrons can be collected 
at a surface electrode and measured. For silicon, this process 
requires 3.6&nbsp;eV of energy loss per free electron generated, so 
that a 15-keV BSE will generate about 4000 free electrons. 
Thus a BSE current of 1&nbsp;nA entering the detector will cre-
ate a collected current of about 4&nbsp;μA as input for the next 
amplification stage. The collection electrodes are located on 
the entrance and back surfaces of the planar wafer detector, 
which is shown in a typical mounting as an annular detec-
tor in . Fig.&nbsp;5.23. The semiconductor BSE detector has the 
advantage of being thin, so that it can be readily mounted 
</p>
<p>under the objective lens where it will not interfere with other 
detectors. The size and proximity to the specimen provide 
a large solid angle and a high take-off angle. As shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;5.23, the semiconductor detector can also be assem-
bled from segments, each of which can be used as a separate 
detector that provides a selectable apparent illumination of 
the SEM image, or the signals from any combination of the 
detectors can be added. Semiconductor detectors can also 
be placed at various locations around the specimen, simi-
lar to the arrangement shown for scintillator detectors in 
. Fig.&nbsp;5.21.
</p>
<p>The semiconductor BSE detector has an energy threshold 
typically in the range 1 keV to 3 keV because of energy loss 
suffered by the BSE during penetration through the entrance 
surface electrode. Above this threshold, the response of the 
detector increases linearly with increasing electron energy, thus 
providing a greater gain from the high energy fraction of BSE.
</p>
<p>kAdjustable Controls
</p>
<p>The semiconductor BSE detector does not have any user- 
adjustable parameters, with the exception of the choice of 
the individual components of a composite multi-detector. 
In some systems, the individual quadrants or halves can be 
selected in various combinations, or the sum of all detectors 
can be used. Some SEMs add an additional semiconductor 
detector that is placed asymmetrically away from the electron 
beam to enhance the effect of apparent oblique illumination.

<p> Everhart&ndash;Thornley Detector

</p>
<p>(1957) solved the problem of detecting very low energy sec-
ondary electrons by using a scintillator with a thin metal 
coating to which a large positive potential, 10&nbsp;kV or higher, 
is applied. This post-specimen acceleration of the second-
ary electrons raises their kinetic energy to a sufficient level 
to cause scintillation in an appropriate material (typically 
plastic or glass doped with an optically active compound) 
after penetrating through the thin metallization layer that 
is applied to discharge the insulating scintillator. To protect 
the primary electron beam from any degradation due to 
encountering this large positive potential asymmetrically 
placed in the specimen chamber, the scintillator is sur-
rounded by an electrically isolated &ldquo;Faraday cage&rdquo; to which 
is applied a modest positive potential of a few hundred 
volts (in some SEMs, the option exists to select the bias over 
a range typically from &minus;50 to + 300&nbsp; V), as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 5.24. The primary beam is negligibly affected by 
exposure to this much lower potential, but the secondary 
electrons can still be collected with great efficiency to the 
vicinity of the Faraday cage, where they are then acceler-
ated by the much higher positive potential applied to the 
scintillator.
</p>
<p>While the E&ndash;T detector does indeed detect the second-
ary electrons emitted by the sample, the nature of the total 
collected signal is actually quite complicated because of 
the different sources of secondary electrons, as illustrated 
in .  Fig.&nbsp; 5.25. The SE1 component generated within the 
landing footprint of the primary beam on the specimen 
cannot be distinguished from the SE2 component pro-
duced by the exiting BSE since they are produced spatially 
within nanometers to micrometers and they have the same 
energy and angular distributions. Since the SE2 production 
</p>
<p>depends on the BSE, rising and falling with the local effects 
on backscattering, the SE2 signal actually carries BSE 
information. Moreover, the BSE are sufficiently energetic 
that while they are not significantly deflected and collected 
by the low Faraday cage potential, the BSE continue along 
their emission trajectory until they encounter the objective 
lens pole piece, stage components, or sample chamber 
walls, where they generate still more secondary electrons, 
designated SE3. Although SE3 are generated centimeters 
away from the beam impact, they are collected with high 
efficiency by the Faraday cage potential, again constituting 
a signal carrying BSE information since their number 
depends on the number of BSE (&ldquo;indirect BSE&rdquo;). Finally, 
those BSE emitted by the specimen into the solid angle 
defined by the E-T scintillator disk are detected (&ldquo;direct 
BSE&rdquo;). This complex mixture of signals plays an important 
role in creating the apparent illumination of the &ldquo;second-
ary electron image.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>kAdjustable Controls
</p>
<p>On some SEMs the Faraday cage bias of the Everhart&ndash;
Thornley detector can be adjusted, typically over a range 
from a negative potential of &ndash;100&nbsp; V or less to a positive 
potential of a few hundred volts. When the Faraday cage 
potential is set to zero or a few volts negative, secondary elec-
tron collection is almost entirely suppressed, so that only the 
direct BSE are collected, giving a scintillator BSE detector 
that is of relatively small solid angle and asymmetrically 
placed on one side of the specimen. When the Faraday cage 
potential is set to the maximum positive value available, the

effects.
</p>
<p> Through-the-Lens (TTL) Electron Detectors
</p>
<p>TTL SE Detector
</p>
<p>In SEMs where the magnetic field of the objective lens 
projects into the specimen chamber, a &ldquo;through-the-lens&rdquo; 
(TTL) secondary electron detector can be implemented, as 
illustrated schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;5.26. SE1 from the inci-
dent beam footprint and SE2 emitted within the BSE sur-
face distribution are captured by the magnetic field and 
spiral up through the lens. After emerging from the top of 
the lens, the secondary electrons are then attracted to an 
Everhart&ndash;Thornley type biased scintillator detector. The 
advantage of the TTL SE detector is the near complete 
exclusion of direct BSE and the abundant SE3 class gener-
ated by BSE striking the chamber walls and pole piece. 
Since these remote SE3 are generated on surfaces far from 
the optic axis of the SEM, they are not efficiently captured 
by the lens field. Because the SE3 class actually represents 
low resolution BSE information, removing SE3 from the 
overall SE signal actually improves the sensitivity of the 
image to the true SE1 component, which is still diluted by 
the BSE-related SE2 component. A further refinement of 
the through-the-lens detector is the introduction of energy 
filtering which allows the microscopist to select a band of 
SE kinetic energy.
</p>
<p>TTL BSE Detector
</p>
<p>For a flat specimen oriented normal to the beam, the cosine 
distribution of BSE creates a significant flux of BSE that pass 
up through the bore of the objective lens. A TTL BSE detec-
tor is created by providing either a direct scintillation BSE 
detector or a separate surface above the lens for BSE-to-SE 
conversion and subsequent detection with another E-T type 
detector.

<p>5.4.5  Specimen Current: The&nbsp;Specimen as&nbsp;Its 
Own Detector
</p>
<p> z The Specimen Can Serve as a Perfect Detector for the 
</p>
<p>Total Number of BSE and SE Emitted
</p>
<p>Consider the interaction of the beam electrons to produce 
BSE and SE.&nbsp;For a 20-keV beam incident on copper, about 30 
out of 100 beam electrons are backscattered (η = 0.3). The 
remaining 70 beam electrons lose all their energy in the solid, 
are reduced to thermal energies, and are captured. 
Additionally, about 10 units of charge are ejected from cop-
per as secondary electrons (δ = 0.1). This leaves a total of 60 
excess electrons in the target. What is the fate of these elec-
trons? To understand this, an alternative view is to consider 
the electron currents, defined as charge per unit time, which 
flow in and out of the specimen. Viewed in this fashion, the 
specimen can be treated as an electrical junction, as illus-
trated schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;5.27, and is subject to the fun-
damental rules which govern junctions in circuits. By 
Thevinin&rsquo;s junction theorem, the currents flowing in and out 
of the junction must exactly balance, or else there will be net 
accumulation or loss of electrical charge, and the specimen 
will charge on a macroscopic scale. If the specimen is a con-
ductor or semiconductor and if there is a path to ground 
from the specimen, then electrical neutrality will be main-
tained by the flow of a current, designated the &ldquo;specimen cur-
rent&rdquo; (also referred to as the &ldquo;target current&rdquo; or &ldquo;absorbed 
current&rdquo;), either to or from ground, depending on the exact 
conditions of beam energy and specimen composition. What 
is the magnitude of the specimen current?
Considering the specimen as a junction, the current flow-
ing into the junction is the beam current, iB, and the cur-
rents flowing out of the junction are the backscattered 
electron current, iBS, and the secondary electron current, 
iSE. For charge balance to occur, the specimen current, iSC, 
is given by

<p>For the copper target, the BSE current will be iBSE = η&times;iB = 0.3 
iB and the SE current will be iSE = δ&times;iB = 0.1 iB. Substituting 
these values in Eq. (5.15) gives the result that the specimen 
current will be iSC = 0.6 iB, double the largest of the conven-
tional emitted imaging currents, the BSE signal. If a path to 
ground is not provided so that the specimen current can flow, 
the specimen will rapidly charge.
</p>
<p>Note that in formulating Eq. (5.15) no consideration is 
given to the large difference in energy carried by the BSE and 
SE.&nbsp;Since current is the passage of charge per unit time, the 
ejection of a 1&nbsp; eV SE from the specimen carries the same 
weight as a 10&nbsp;keV BSE in affecting the specimen current sig-
nal. Moreover, the specimen current is not sensitive to the 
direction of emission of BSE and SE, or to their subsequent 
fate in the SEM specimen chamber, as long as they do not 
return to the specimen as a result of re-scattering. Thus, 
specimen current constitutes a signal that is sensitive only to 
number effects, that is, the total numbers of BSE and SE leav-
ing the specimen.
</p>
<p>The specimen serves as its own collector for the specimen 
current. As such, the specimen current signal is readily avail-
able just by insulating the specimen from electrical ground 
and then measuring the specimen current flowing to ground 
through a wire to ground. Knowledge of the actual specimen 
current is extremely useful for establishing consistent operat-
ing conditions, and is critical for dose-based X-ray micro-
analysis. The original beam current itself be measured by 
creating a &ldquo;Faraday cup&rdquo; in the specimen or specimen stage 
by drilling a blind hole and directing the incident beam into 
the hole: since no BSE or SE can escape the Faraday cup, the 
measured specimen current then must equal the beam cur-
rent. But by measuring the specimen current as a function of 
the beam position during the scan, an image can be formed 
that is sensitive to the total emission of BSE and SE regardless 
of the direction of emission and their subsequent fate inter-
acting with external detectors, the final lens pole piece, and 
the walls of the specimen chamber. Does the specimen cur-
rent signal actually convey useful information? As described 
below under contrast formation, the specimen current signal 
contains exactly the same information as that carried by the 
BSE and SE currents. Since external electron detectors mea-
sure a convolution of backscattered and/or secondary cur-
rent with other characteristics such as energy and/or 
directionality, the specimen current signal can give a unique 
view of the specimen (Newbury 1976).
</p>
<p>To make use of the specimen current signal, the current 
must be routed through an amplifier on its way to ground. 
The difficulty is that we must be able to work with a current 
similar in magnitude to the beam current, without any high 
gain physical amplification process such as electron-hole pair 
production in a solid state detector or the electron cascade in 
an electron multiplier. To achieve acceptable bandwidth at 
the high gains necessary, most current amplifiers take the 
form of a low input impedance operational amplifier (Fiori 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al. 1974). Such amplifiers can operate with currents as low 
as 10 pA and still provide adequate bandwidth to view 
acceptable images at slow visual scan rates (one 500-line 
frame/s).
</p>
<p>5.4.6  A Useful, Practical Measure of a 
Detector: Detective Quantum 
Efficiency
</p>
<p>The geometric efficiency is just one factor in the overall per-
formance of a detector, and while this quantity is relatively 
straightforward to define in the case of a passive BSE detec-
tor, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 5.20, it is much more difficult to 
describe for an E&ndash;T detector because of the mix of BSE and 
direct SE1 and SE2 signal components and the complex con-
version and collection of the remote SE3 component pro-
duced where BSE strike the objective lens, BSE detector, and 
chamber walls. A second important factor in detector perfor-
mance is the efficiency with which each collected electron is 
converted into useful signal. Thirdly, noise may be intro-
duced at various stages in the amplification process to the 
digitization which creates the final intensity recorded in the 
computer memory for the pixel at which the beam dwells.
</p>
<p>All of these factors are taken into account by the detective 
quantum efficiency (DQE). The DQE is a robust measure of 
detector performance that can be used in the calculation of 
limitations imposed on imaging through the threshold cur-
rent/contrast equation (Joy et&nbsp;al. 1996).
</p>
<p>The DQE is defined as (Jones 1959)
</p>
<p>DQE
experimental theoretictal
</p>
<p>= ( ) ( )S N S N/ / /
2 2
</p>
<p> 
(5.16)
</p>
<p>where S is the signal and N is the noise. Determining the 
DQE for a detector requires measurement of the experimen-
tal S/N ratio as produced under defined conditions of speci-
men composition, beam current and pixel dwell time that 
enable an estimate of the corresponding theoretical S/N ratio. 
This measurement can be performed by imaging a featureless 
specimen that ideally produces a fixed signal response which 
translates into a single gray level in the digitally recorded 
image, giving a direct measure of the signal, S. The corre-
sponding noise, N, is determined from the measured width 
of the distribution of gray levels around the average value.
</p>
<p> Measuring the&nbsp;DQE: BSE Semiconductor 
Detector
</p>
<p>Joy et&nbsp; al. (1996) describe a procedure by which the experi-
mental S/N ratio can be estimated from a digital image of a 
specimen that produces a unique gray level, so that the broad-
ening observed in the image histogram of the ideal gray level 
is a quantitative measure of the various noise sources that are 
inevitable in the total measurement process that produces the 
image. Thus, the first requirement is a specimen with a highly 
polished featureless surface that will produce unique values of 
η and δ and which does not contribute any other sources of 
</p>

</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>contrast (e.g., topography, compositional differences, electron 
channeling, or most problematically, changing δ and η values 
due to the accumulation of contamination). A polished sili-
con wafer provides a suitable sample, and with careful pre-
cleaning, including plasma cleaning in the SEM airlock if 
available, the contamination problem can be minimized satis-
factorily during the sequence of measurements required. As 
an alternative to silicon, a metallographically polished (but 
not etched) pure metallic element (metallic) surface, such as 
nickel, molybdenum, gold, etc., will be suitable. Because cal-
culation of the theoretical S/N ratio is required for the DQE 
calculation with Eq.&nbsp;5.16, the beam current must be accurately 
measured. The SEM must thus be equipped with a picoam-
meter to measure the beam current, and if an in-column 
Faraday cup is not available, then a specimen stage Faraday 
cup (e.g., a blind hole covered with a small [e.g., 
&lt;100-μm-diameter] aperture) is required to completely cap-
ture the beam without loss of BSE or SE so that a measure-
ment of the specimen current equals the beam current.
</p>
<p>Because the detector will have a &ldquo;dark current,&rdquo; i.e., a 
response with no beam current, it is necessary to make a 
series of measurements with changing beam current. It is 
also important to defeat any automatic image gain scaling 
that some SEMs provide as a &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; feature for the 
user that acts to automatically compensate for changes in the 
incident beam current by adjusting the imaging amplifier 
gain to maintain a steady mid-range gray level.
</p>
<p>Measurement sequence
 1. Choose a beam current which will serve as the high end 
</p>
<p>of the beam current range, and using the image histo-
gram function, adjust the imaging amplifier controls 
(often designated &ldquo;contrast&rdquo; and &ldquo;brightness&rdquo;) to place 
the average gray level of the specimen near the top of the 
range, being careful that the upper tail of the gray level 
distribution of the image of the specimen does not 
saturate (&ldquo;clip&rdquo;) at the maximum gray level (255 for an 
8-bit image, 65,535 for a 16-bit image).
</p>
<p> 2. Keeping the same values for the image amplifier 
parameters (autoscaling of the imaging amplifier must 
be defeated before beginning the measurement process), 
choose a beam current that places the average gray level 
of the specimen near low end of the gray level range, 
checking to see that the gray level distribution of the 
image is completely within the histogram range&mdash;that is, 
there is no clipping of the distribution at the bottom 
(black) of the range.
</p>
<p> 3. With the minimum and maximum of the current range 
established, record a sequence of images with different 
beam currents between the low and high values and use 
the image histogram tool to determine the average gray 
level for each beam current.
</p>
<p> 4. A graphical plot of data measured with a semiconductor 
BSE detector for a polished Mo target produces the 
result illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;5.28, where the y-axis intercept 
value is a measure of the dark current gray level inten-
sity, GLDC (corresponding to zero beam current) of this 
particular BSE detector.
</p>
<p> 5. Choose an image recorded within this range and 
determine the mean gray level, Gmean, and the variance, 
Svar (the square of the standard deviation) using the 
image histogram function, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;5.29.

<p>6.1  Image Construction by Scanning 
Action
</p>
<p>After leaving the electron source, the beam follows the central 
(optic) axis of the lens system and is sequentially defined by 
apertures and focused by the magnetic and/or electrostatic 
fields of the lens system. Within the final (objective) lens, a sys-
tem of scan coils acts to displace the beam off the optic axis so 
that it can be addressed to a location on the specimen, as illus-
trated schematically for single deflection scanning in . Fig.&nbsp;6.1. 
</p>
<p>At any particular time, there is only one ray path (solid line) 
through the scanning system and the beam reaches only one 
location on the specimen, for example, position 3&nbsp;in . Fig.&nbsp;6.1. 
The SEM image is a geometric construction created under 
computer control by addressing the focused beam to a sequence 
of discrete x-y locations on the specimen and measuring the 
effect of the interaction of the beam with the specimen at each 
location. For a single gray- scale SEM image, this interaction 
could be the output from a single electron detector, such as the 
Everhart&ndash;Thornley detector. It is also possible to measure the 
output from more than one detector simultaneously while the 
beam is addressed to a single x-y location. When this is done, 
multiple gray- scale SEM images are built up at the same time 
during the scan. It is essential to realize that even when these 
multiple signals are being collected simultaneously and multi-
ple images are produced, only a single scan is needed; the par-
allel nature of the acquisition arises from parallel detection, not 
parallel scanning. Note that no &ldquo;true image&rdquo; actually exists 
within the SEM in the same sense as the image created in a light 
optical microscope, where actual ray paths extend from each 
point on the specimen through the lens system to a corre-
sponding point on the image recording medium, whether that 
is the eye of a human viewer or the positionally sensitive detec-
tor of a digital camera. In the SEM, at each location sampled by 
the incident electron beam, each signal is measured with an 
appropriate detector and the analog measurement is converted 
to an equivalent digital value (using an analog-to-digital con-
verter, ADC). The beam x-y location and the intensity(ies) I
</p>
<p>j
 of 
</p>
<p>the signal(s) of interest generate a digital stream of data packets 
(x, y, I
</p>
<p>j
), where the index j represents the various signals avail-
</p>
<p>able: backscattered electrons (BSE), secondary electrons (SE), 
absorbed current, X-rays, cathodoluminescence, etc.
</p>
<p>A simple description of this &ldquo;scanning action&rdquo; to create an 
image is shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp; 6.2, where an area 
with equal edge dimensions l being scanned on the specimen 
is effectively divided into an x-y grid of square picture ele-

<p>ments or &ldquo;pixels&rdquo; of number n along an edge. The specimen 
pixel edge dimension is given by
</p>
<p>Specimen pixeldimension = l n/
 
</p>
<p>(6.1)
</p>
<p>With equal values of the scan l along the x- and y- dimensions, 
the pixels will be square. Strictly, the pixel is the geometric 
center of the area defined by the edges given by Eq. (6.1), and 
the center-to-center spacing or pitch is given by Eq. (6.1). In 
creating an SEM image, the center of the beam is placed in 
the center of a specific pixel, dwells for a specific time, t
</p>
<p>p
, and 
</p>
<p>the signal information I
sig
</p>
<p> from various sources &ldquo;j&rdquo;&mdash;e.g., SE, 
BSE, X-ray, etc.&mdash;collected during that time at that (x, y) 
location is stored at a corresponding location in a data 
matrix with a minimum of three dimensions (x, y, I
</p>
<p>j
). The 
</p>
<p>final image viewed by the microscopist is created by reading 
the stored data matrix into a corresponding pattern of (x, y) 
display pixels with a total edge dimension L, and adjusting 
the display brightness (&ldquo;gray level&rdquo;, varying from black to 
white) according to the relative strength of the measured 
signal(s).
</p>
<p>6.2  Magnification
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnification&rdquo; in such a scanning system is given by the 
ratio of the edge dimensions of the specimen area and the 
display area:
</p>
<p>M L= / l
 
</p>
<p>(6.2)
</p>
<p>Since the final display size is typically fixed, increasing the 
magnification in this scanning system means that the edge 
dimension of the area scanned on the specimen is reduced.
</p>
<p>6.2.1  Magnification, Image Dimensions, 
and&nbsp;Scale Bars
</p>
<p>One of the most important pieces of information that the 
microscopist seeks is the size of objects of interest. The first 
step in determining the size of an object is knowledge of the 
parameters in Eq. (6.2): the linear edge length of the area 
scanned on the specimen and on the display. The nominal 
SEM magnification appropriate to the display as viewed 
by the microscopist is typically embedded in the alphanu-
meric record that appears with the image as presented on 
most SEMs, as shown in the example of . Fig.&nbsp; 6.3, and as 
recorded with the metadata associated with the digital record 
of the image. &ldquo;Magnification&rdquo; only has a useful meaning for 
the display on which the original image was viewed, since 
this is the display for which L in Eq. (6.2) is strictly valid. If 
the image is transferred to another display with a different 
value of L, for example, projected on a large screen, then the 
specific magnification value embedded in the metadata bar 
becomes meaningless. Much more meaningful are the x- and

nal boundaries of the scanned square area on the specimen, 
</p>
<p>l, in . Fig.&nbsp; 6.2, or for rectangular images, the dimensions 
in orthogonal directions, l by k (dimensions: millimeters, 
micrometers, or nanometers, as appropriate). While the 
image dimension(s) is a much more robust term that auto-
matically scales with the presentation of the image, this term 
is also vulnerable to inadvertent mistakes, such as might 
happen if the image is &ldquo;cropped,&rdquo; either digitally or manu-
ally in hard copy and the appropriate reduction in size is not 
recorded by modifying l (and k, if rectangular) appropriately. 
The most robust measure in terms of image integrity is the 
dimensional scale bar, which shows the length that corre-
sponds to a specific millimeter, micrometer, or nanometer 
measure. Because this feature is embedded directly in the 
image (as well as in the metadata associated with the image), 
it cannot be lost unless the image is severely (and obviously) 
cropped. Such a scale bar automatically enlarges or contracts 
as the image size is modified for subsequent publication or 
projection.

</p>
<p>6.3.1  Calibrating the&nbsp;Image
</p>
<p>The validity of the dimensional marker displayed on the SEM 
image should not be automatically assumed (Postek et&nbsp; al. 
2014). As part of a laboratory quality-assurance program, the 
dimensional marker and/or the x- and y-dimensions of the 
scanned field should be calibrated and the calibration peri-
odically confirmed. This can be accomplished with a &ldquo;scale 
calibration artifact,&rdquo; a specimen that contains features with 
various defined spacings whose dimensions are traceable to 
the fundamental primary length standard through a national 
measurement institution. An example of such a scale calibra-
tion artifact suitable for SEM is Reference Material RM 8820

<p>Technology [USA]), shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 6.4. This scale calibra-
tion artifact consists of an elaborate collection of linear fea-
tures produced by lithography on a silicon substrate. It is 
important to calibrate the SEM over the full range of magnifi-
cations to be used for subsequent work. RM 8820 contains 
large- scale structures suitable for low and intermediate mag-
nifications, for example, a span of 1500&nbsp;μm (1.5&nbsp;mm) as indi-
cated by the red arrows in . Fig.&nbsp;6.4a, that permit calibration 
of scan fields ranging up to 1&nbsp; &times; 1&nbsp; cm (e.g., a nominal 
</p>
<p>magnification of 10&times; on a 10&nbsp;x 10-cm display). Scanned fields 
as small as 1&nbsp; &times; 1&nbsp; μm (e.g., a nominal magnification of 
100,000&times;) can be calibrated with the series of structures with 
pitches of various repeat distances shown in . Fig.&nbsp;6.4b. The 
structures present in RM 8820 enable simultaneous calibra-
tion along the x- and y-axes of the image so that image distor-
tion can be minimized. Accurate calibration in orthogonal 
directions is critical for establishing &ldquo;square pixels&rdquo; in order to 
avoid introducing serious distortions into the scanned image.

<p>With square pixels, the shape of an object is faithfully trans-
ferred, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;6.5a, while non-square pixels in the

be placed normal to the optic axis of the SEM to eliminate 
image foreshortening effects (see further discussion below).

<p> Using a&nbsp;Calibrated Structure in&nbsp;ImageJ-Fiji
</p>
<p>The image-processing software engine ImageJ-Fiji includes a 
&ldquo;Set Scale&rdquo; function that enables a user to transfer the image 
calibration to subsequent measurements made with various 
</p>
<p>functions. As shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 6.6a, starting with an image 
of a primary or secondary calibration artifact (i.e., where 
&ldquo;secondary&rdquo; refers to a commercial vendor artifact that is 
traceable to a primary national measurement calibration 
artifact) that contains a set of defined distances, the user 
can specify a vector that spans a particular pitch to establish 
the calibration at that magnification setting. This calibra-
tion procedure should then be repeated to cover the range 
of magnification settings to be used for subsequent measure-
ments of unknowns. Note that the calibration that has been 
performed is only strictly valid for the SEM working distance 
at which the calibration artifact has been imaged. When a

</p>
<p>different working distance (i.e., objective lens strength) is 
used subsequently to image the unknown specimen, the SEM 
software is likely to make automatic adjustments for differ-
ent lens strength and scan dimensions that alter the effective 
magnification. For the most robust measurement environ-
ment, the user should use the calibration artifact to deter-
mine the validity of the SEM software specified scale at other 
working distances to develop a comprehensive calibration.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the SEM magnification calibration has 
already been performed with an appropriate calibration 
artifact, then subsequent images of unknowns will be 
recorded with accurate dimensional information in the form 
of a scale bar and/or specified scan field dimensions. This 
information can be used with the &ldquo;Set Scale&rdquo; function in 
ImageJ-Fiji as shown for a specified field width in . Fig.&nbsp;6.6b 
where a vector (yellow) has been chosen that spans the full 
image width. The &ldquo;Set Scale&rdquo; tool will record this length and 
the user then specifies the &ldquo;Known Distance&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Unit 
of Length.&rdquo; To minimize the effect of the uncertainty associ-
ated with selecting the endpoints when defining the scale for 
this image, the larger of the two dimensions reported in the 
vendor software was chosen, in this case the full horizontal 
field width of 12&nbsp;μm rather than the much shorter embedded 
length scale of 2&nbsp;μm.
</p>
<p> Making Routine Linear Measurements 
With&nbsp;ImageJ-Fiji (Flat Sample Placed Normal 
to&nbsp;Optic Axis)
</p>
<p>For the case of a flat sample placed normal to the optic axis of 
the SEM, linear measurements of structures can be made fol-
lowing a simple, straightforward procedure after the image 
calibration procedure has been performed. Typical image- 
processing software tools directly available in the SEM opera-
tional software or in external software packages such as 
ImageJ-Fiji enable the microscopist to make simple linear 
measurements of objects. With the calibration established, 
the &ldquo;Line&rdquo; tool is used to define the particular linear mea-
surement to be made, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;6.6c, and then the 
&ldquo;Measure&rdquo; tool is selected, producing the &ldquo;Results&rdquo; table that 
is shown. Repeated measurements will be accumulated in 
this table.
</p>
<p>6.4  Image Defects
</p>
<p>6.4.1  Projection Distortion (Foreshortening)
</p>
<p>The calibration of the SEM image must be performed with 
the planar surface of the calibration artifact placed perpen-
dicular to the optic axis (i.e., x- and y-axes at right angles rel-
ative to the z-axis), and only measurements that are made on 
planar objects that are similarly oriented will be valid. When 
the specimen is tilted around an axis, for example, the x-axis, 
the resulting SEM image is subject to projection distortion 
causing foreshortening along the y-axis. Foreshortening 
occurs because the effective magnification is reduced along 
the y-axis relative to the x-axis (tilt axis), as illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp;6.7. For nominal magnifications exceeding 100&times;, the

<p>successive scan rays of the SEM image have such a small angu-
lar spread relative to the optic axis that they create a nearly 
parallel projection to create the geometric mapping of the 
specimen three-dimensional space to the two- dimensional 
image space. As shown in . Fig.&nbsp;6.7, a linear feature of length 
L
</p>
<p>true
 lying in a plane tilted at an angle, θ, (where θ is defined 
</p>
<p>relative to a plane perpendicular to the optic axis) is fore-
shortened in the SEM image according to the relation
</p>
<p>L Limage true= * cosθ  
(6.3)
</p>
<p>For the situation shown in . Fig.&nbsp;6.7a, all four linear objects 
would have the same apparent size in the SEM image, but only 
one, object B, would be shown with the correct length since it 
lies in a plane perpendicular to the optic axis, while the true 
lengths of the other linear objects would be significantly 
underestimated. For the most severe case, object D, which lies 
on the most highly tilted surface with θ = 75&deg;, the object is a 
factor of 3.9 longer than it appears in the image. The effect of 
foreshortening is dramatically illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;6.7b, where 
familiar objects, paper clips, are seen in a wide area SEM 
image at 0&deg; tilt and 70&deg; tilt. At high tilt, the length of the first 
paper clip parallel to the tilt axis remains the same, while the 
second paper clip that is perpendicular to the tilt axis is highly 
foreshortened (Note that the third paper clip, which also lies 
parallel to the tilt axis, appears shorter than the first paper clip 
because the effective magnification decreases down the tilted 
surface). As shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;6.8, foreshortening 
causes a square to appear as a rectangle. The effect of fore-
shortening is shown for an SEM image of a planar copper grid 
in . Fig.&nbsp;6.9, where the square openings of the grid are cor-
rectly imaged at θ = 0&deg; in . Fig.&nbsp; 6.9a. When the specimen 
</p>
<p>plane is tilted to θ = 45&deg;, the grid appears to have rectangular 
openings, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;6.9b, with the shortened side of 
the true squares running parallel to the y-axis, while the cor-
rectly sized side runs parallel to the x-axis, which is the axis of 
tilt. Some SEMs are equipped with a &ldquo;tilt correction&rdquo; feature in 
which the y-scan perpendicular to the tilt axis is decreased to 
compensate for the extended length (relative to the x-scan 
along the tilt axis) of the scan excursion on the tilted speci-
men, as shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp; 6.9c. Tilt correction 
creates the same magnification (i.e., the same pixel dimen-
sion) along orthogonal x- and y-axes, which restores the 
proper shape of the squares, as seen in . Fig.&nbsp;6.9c. However, 
this scan transformation is only correct for objects that lie in 
the plane of the specimen. . Figure&nbsp;6.9c also contains a spher-
ical particle, which appears to be circular at θ = 0&deg; and at 
θ = 45&deg; without tilt correction, since the normal scan projects 
the intersection of the plane of the scan sphere as a circle. 
However, when tilt correction is applied at θ = 45&deg;, the sphere 
now appears to be a distorted ovoid. Thus, applying tilt cor-
rection to the image of an object with three- dimensional fea-
tures of arbitrary orientation will result in image distortions 
that will increase in severity with the degree of local tilt.
</p>
<p>6.4.2  Image Defocusing (Blurring)
</p>
<p>The act of focusing an SEM image involves adjusting the 
strength of the objective lens to bring the narrowest part of 
the focused beam cross section to be coincident with the 
surface. If the specimen has a flat, planar surface placed nor-
mal to the beam, then the situation illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;6.10a 
will exist at sufficiently low magnification. . Figure&nbsp; 6.10a

<p>shows the locations of the beam at the pixel centers in the 
middle of the squares and the effective sampling footprint. 
The sampling footprint consists of the contribution of the 
incident beam diameter (in this case finely focused to a 
diameter &lt;10&nbsp;nm) and the surface emergence area of the BSE 
and SE, which is controlled by the interaction volume. 
. Figure&nbsp; 6.10a considers a situation of a low beam energy 
(e.g., 5&nbsp;keV) and a high atomic number (e.g., Au). For these 
conditions, the beam sampling footprint only occupies a 
</p>
<p>small fraction of each pixel area so that there is no possibility 
of overlap, i.e., sampling of adjacent pixels. Now consider 
what happens as the magnification is increased, i.e., the 
length l in Eq. (6.1) decreases while the pixel number, n, 
remains the same: the distance between pixel centers 
decreases, but the beam sampling footprint remains the 
same size for this particular material and beam landing 
energy. The situation shown in . Fig.&nbsp;6.10b for the original 
beam sampling  footprint relative to the pixel spacing and

</p>
<p>four successive increases in magnification reveals that as the 
pixel spacing becomes smaller, the beam sampling footprint 
eventually leaks into the surrounding pixels, so that the 
beam no longer samples exclusively the region of a single 
pixel. Eventually, when enough pixels overlap, the observer 
will perceive this leakage as image defocusing or blurring. 
The reality and limitations of this situation become obvious 
when the microscopist seeks to perform high spatial resolu-
tion microscopy, a topic which will be covered in more depth 
in module 10 on high resolution SEM.
</p>
<p>The effects of blurring are also encountered in the trivial 
case when the objective lens is strengthened or weakened, 
which moves the minimum beam convergence along the ver-
tical axis (either up or down), as shown schematically in 
. Fig.&nbsp;6.11a, increasing the size of the beam that encounters 
the specimen surface. The beam diameter that encounters the 
specimen surface will be larger in either case because of the 
finite convergence angle, α. As the beam samples progres-
sively more adjacent pixels just due to the increase in beam 
size, and not dependent on the BSE-SE sampling footprint, 
the observer will eventually perceive the defocusing, and 
hopefully correct the situation!
</p>
<p>Defocusing is also encountered when the specimen 
has features that extend along the optic axis. For example, 
defocusing may be encountered when planar specimens are 
tilted or rough topographic specimens are examined, even 
at low magnifications, i.e., large scanned areas, as illustrated 
schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;6.11b, c. In these situations, the diam-
eter of the converged beam that encounters the specimen 
depends on the distance of the feature from the bottom of 
the objective lens and the convergence angle of the beam, α. 
Because the beam is focused to a minimum diameter at a spe-
cific distance from the objective lens, the working distance W, 
any feature of the specimen that the scanned beam encoun-
ters at any other distance along the optic axis will inevitably 
involve a larger beam diameter, which can easily exceed the 
sampling footprint of the BSE and SE.&nbsp;. Figure&nbsp;6.11d shows 
an image of Mt. St. Helens volcanic ash particles where the 
top of the large particle is in good focus, but the focus along 
the sides of the particles deteriorates into obvious blurring, 
as also occurs for the small particles dispersed around the 
large particle on the conductive tape support. This defocus 
situation can only be improved by reducing the convergence 
angle, α, as described in Depth-of-Field Mode operation.
</p>
<p>6.5  Making Measurements on&nbsp;Surfaces 
With&nbsp;Arbitrary Topography: 
Stereomicroscopy
</p>
<p>By operating in Depth-of-Field Mode, which optimizes the 
choice of the beam convergence angle, α, a useful range of 
focus along the optic axis can be established that is sufficient 
to render effective images of complex three-dimensional 
objects. . Figure&nbsp; 6.12 shows an example of a specimen 
(metal fracture surface) with complex surface topography. 
The red arrows mark members of a class of flat objects. If the 
microscopist&rsquo;s task is to measure the size of these objects, 
the simple linear measurement that is possible in a single 
SEM image is subject to large errors because the local tilt of 
each feature is different and unknown, which corresponds 
to the situation illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;6.7. Although lost in a 
single two- dimensional image, the third dimension of an 
irregular surface can be recovered by the technique of ste-
reomicroscopy.

<p>6.5.1  Qualitative Stereomicroscopy
</p>
<p>The human visual process creates the perception of depth 
and the three-dimensional character of objects by combin-
ing the separate two-dimensional views provided by the left 
eye and the right eye to create a fused image, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;6.13. The angular difference between the eyes creates 
two distinct views containing parallax information, which 
is the horizontal shift (relative to a vertical axis) of a feature 
common to the two separate views. The parallax is the criti-
cal information that the brain uses to create the sensation of 
depth in the fused image: the larger the parallax, the closer 
the object is to the viewer. To create a similar sensation of 
depth, SEM stereomicroscopy operates by mimicking the 
</p>
<p>human visual process and creating two angularly separated 
views of the specimen with parallax information. In SEM 
imaging, the electron beam is the &ldquo;eye of the observer&rdquo; (see 
the &ldquo;Image Interpretation&rdquo; module), so the two required 
images for stereo imaging must be obtained by either 
changing the orientation of the beam relative to the speci-
men (beam rocking method), or by changing the orienta-
tion of the specimen relative to the fixed electron beam 
(specimen tilting method). An appropriate image separa-
tion method such as the anaglyph technique (e.g., using red 
and cyan filters to view color-coded images) then presents 
the each member of the image pair to the left or right eye so 
that the viewer&rsquo;s natural imaging process will create a fused 
image that reveals the third dimension. (Note that there is a

</p>
<p>fraction of the population for whom this process is not 
effective at creating the sense of viewing a three-dimen-
sional object.)
</p>
<p> Fixed beam, Specimen Position Altered
</p>
<p>Parallax can be created by changing the specimen tilt relative 
to the optic axis (beam) by recording two images with a dif-
ference in tilt angle ranging from 2&deg; to 10&deg;. The specific value 
depends on the degree of topography of the specimen, and 
the optimum choice may require a trial-and-error approach. 
Weak topography will generally require a larger tilt difference 
to create a suitable three-dimensional effect. However, if the 
tilt angle difference between the images is made too large, it 
may not be possible for a viewer to successfully fuse the 
images and visualize the topography, especially for large- 
scale topography.
</p>
<p>A suitable procedure to achieve SEM stereomicroscopy 
with a fixed beam by tilting the specimen has the following 
steps:
 1. Determine where the tilt axis lies in the SEM image. The 
</p>
<p>eventual images must be presented to the viewer with 
horizontal parallax (i.e., all the shift between the two 
images must be across a vertical axis), so the tilt axis 
must be oriented vertically. The images can be recorded 
and rotated appropriately within image processing 
software such as ImageJ-Fiji, or the scan rotation 
function of the SEM can be used to orient the tilt axis

</p>
<p>along the vertical. In either case, note the location of the 
Everhart&ndash;Thornley detector in the image, which will 
provide the general sense of illumination. Ideally, the 
position of the E&ndash;T detector should be at the top of the 
image. However, after image rotation to orient the tilt 
axis vertically, the effective position of the Everhart-
Thornley detector is likely to be different from this ideal 
12-o&rsquo;clock position (top center of image).
</p>
<p> 2. Record an image of the area of interest at the low tilt 
angle, for example, stage tilt = 0&deg;.
</p>
<p> 3. Using this image as a reference, increase the tilt angle to 
the desired value, e.g., stage tilt = 5&deg;, while maintaining 
the location of the field of view. Depending on the 
mechanical sophistication of the specimen stage, 
changing the tilt may cause the field of view to shift 
laterally, requiring continual relocation of the desired 
field of view during the tilting process to avoid losing the 
area of interest, especially at high magnification on 
specimens with complex topography.
</p>
<p> 4. The vertical position of the specimen may also shift 
during tilting. To avoid introducing rotation in the 
second (high tilt image) by changing the objective lens 
strength to re-focus, the vertical stage motion (z-axis) 
should be used to refocus the image. After careful 
adjustment of the x-y-z position of the stage using the 
low tilt image to locate the area of interest, record this 
high tilt image.
</p>
<p> 5. Within the image-processing software, assign the low tilt 
image to the RED image channel and the high tilt image 
to the CYAN (GREEN-BLUE channels combined, or the 
individual GREEN or BLUE image channels, depending 
on the type of anaglyph viewing filters available). Apply 
the image fusion function to create the stereo image, and 
view this image display with appropriate red (left eye) 
</p>
<p>and blue (right eye) glasses. Note: The image-processing 
software may allow fine scale adjustments (shifts and/or 
rotations) to improve the registration of the images. This 
procedure is illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;6.14 for the &ldquo;Anaglyph 
Maker STEREOEYE&rdquo; software (7 http://www.stereoeye.jp/
index_e.html). Examples of &ldquo;stereo pairs&rdquo; created in this 
manner are shown in . Fig.&nbsp;6.15 (a particle of ash from 
the Mt. St. Helens eruption) and . Fig.&nbsp;6.16 (gypsum 
crystals from cement).
</p>
<p>kNote
</p>
<p>While usually successful, this SEM stereomicroscopy &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; 
may not produce the desired stereo effect on your particular 
instrument. Because of differing conventions for labeling tilt 
motions or due to unexpected image rotation applied in the 
software, the sense of the topography may be reversed (e.g., a 
topographic feature that is an &ldquo;inner&rdquo; falsely becomes an 
&ldquo;outer&rdquo; and vice versa). It is good practice when first imple-
menting stereomicroscopy with an SEM to start with a simple 
specimen with known topography such as a coin with raised 
lettering or a scratch on a flat surface. Apply the procedure 
above and inspect the results to determine if the proper sense 
of the topography has been achieved in the resulting stereo 
pair. If not, be sure the parallax shift is horizontal, that is, 
across a vertical axis (if necessary, use software functions to 
rotate the images to vertically orient the tilt axis). If the tilt axis 
is vertical but the stereo pair still shows the wrong sense of the 
topography, try reversing the images so the &ldquo;high tilt&rdquo; image is 
now viewed by the left eye and the &ldquo;low tilt&rdquo; image viewed by 
the right eye. Once the proper procedure has been discovered 
to give the correct sense of the topography on a known test 
structure, follow this convention for future stereomicroscopy 
work. (Note: A small but significant fraction of observers find 
it difficult to fuse the images to form a stereo image.)

<p> Fixed Specimen, Beam Incidence Angle 
Changed
</p>
<p>The beam incidence angle relative to the specimen can 
be changed by a small value by means of a deflection in 
the final stage of the scan to create the two distinct views 
needed to achieve the stereo effect. An example of a stereo 
pair created in this manner is shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 6.17 for a 
</p>
<p>fractured fragment of galena. By applying the two beam tilts 
to alternate image scans at high rate, &ldquo;live&rdquo; 3D SEM imaging 
can be achieved that is nearly &ldquo;flicker free.&rdquo; By eliminating 
the need for mechanical stage motion as well as avoiding 
problems which frequently occur due to shifting of the area 
of interest during mechanical tilting, the speed of the beam 
tilting method makes it very powerful for studying complex

<p>topography. This is especially true at high magnification 
when the act of mechanical stage tilting is more likely to 
cause significant lateral shifting of the specimen, rendering 
the mechanical stage tilt stereo method tedious. An example 
of a stereo pair for a silver crystal produced with the beam 
tilt method at higher magnification is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;6.18.

<p>(Boyde 1973, 1974a,b; Wells 1974). This procedure can be 
accomplished even if the operator is not personally able to 
perceive the qualitative stereo effect using the anaglyph or 
other methods to present the two images.
 1. The first step is to record a stereo pair with tilt angles θ
</p>
<p>1
 
</p>
<p>and θ
2
 and with the tilt axis placed in a vertical orienta-
</p>
<p>tion in the images. The difference in tilt angle between 
the members of the stereo pair is a critical parameter:
</p>
<p>∆θ θ θ= &minus;
2 1  (6.4)
</p>
<p> 2. A set of orthogonal axes is centered on a recognizable 
feature, as shown in the schematic example in 
. Fig.&nbsp;6.19. This point will then be arbitrarily assigned 
the X-, Y-, Z-coordinates (0, 0, 0) and all subsequent 
height measurements will be with respect to this point. 
The axes are selected so that the y-axis is parallel to the 
tilt axis and the x-axis is perpendicular to the tilt axis.
</p>
<p> 3. For the feature of interest, the (X, Y)-coordinates are 
measured in the Left (X
</p>
<p>L
, Y
</p>
<p>L
) and Right (X
</p>
<p>R
, Y
</p>
<p>R
) 
</p>
<p>members of the stereo pair using the calibrated distance 
marker. The parallax, P, of a feature is given by
</p>
<p>P X X= ( )L R&minus;  
(6.5)
</p>
<p>  With this convention, points lying above the tilt axis will 
have positive parallax values P. Note that as an internal 
consistency check, Y
</p>
<p>L
 = Y
</p>
<p>R
 if the y-axis has been properly 
</p>
<p>aligned with the tilt axis.
 4. For SEM magnifications above a nominal value of 100&times;, 
</p>
<p>the scan angle will be sufficiently small that it can be 
assumed that the scan is effectively moving parallel to 
the optic axis, which enables the use of simple formulas 
for quantification. With reference to the fixed point (0, 0, 
0), the three-dimensional coordinates X

<p> Measuring a&nbsp;Simple Vertical Displacement
</p>
<p>The stereo pair in . Fig.&nbsp; 6.20a illustrates a typical three- 
dimensional measurement problem: for this screw thread, 
how far above or below is the feature circled in green relative 
to the feature circled in yellow? The left image (low tilt, θ = 0&deg;) 
and right image (high tilt, θ = 5&deg;) are prepared according to 
the convention described above and oriented so that the tilt 
axis is vertical. It is good practice to inspect the stereo pair 
with the anaglyph method shown in . Fig.&nbsp;6.14 to ensure that 
the stereo pair is properly arranged, and to qualitatively 
assess the nature of the topography, i.e., determine how fea-
tures are arranged relative to each other, as shown for this 
image of the screw thread in . Fig.&nbsp;6.20a. In . Fig.&nbsp;6.20b, a 
set of x- (horizontal) and y- (vertical) axes are established in 
each image centered on the feature in the yellow circle, which 
is assigned the origin of coordinates (0, 0, 0). Using this coor-
dinate system, measurements are made of the feature of 
interest (within the green circle) in the left (X
</p>
<p>L
 = 144&nbsp; μm, 
</p>
<p>Y
L
 = &minus;118&nbsp; μm) and right (X

</p>
<p>(6.10)
</p>
<p>Note that the sign of the parallax is negative, which means 
that the green circle feature is below the yellow circle feature, 
a result that is confirmed by the qualitative inspection of the 
stereo pair in . Fig.&nbsp; 6.20a. Inserting these values into Eq. 
(6.6), the Z-coordinate of the end of the green circle feature 
relative to the yellow circle feature is calculated to be:

</p>
<p>Thus, the feature in the green circle is 619&nbsp;μm below the fea-
ture in the yellow circle at the origin of coordinates. The 
uncertainty budget for this measurement consists of the fol-
lowing components:
 1. Scale calibration error: with the careful use of a primary 
</p>
<p>or secondary dimensional artifact, this uncertainty 
contribution can be reduced to 1 % relative or less.
</p>
<p> 2. Measurement of the feature individual coordinates: The 
magnitude of this uncertainty contribution depends on 
how well the position of a feature can be recognized and 
on the separation of the features of interest. By selecting 
a magnification such that the features whose vertical 
separation is to be measured span at least half of the 
image field, the uncertainty in the individual coordinates 
should be approximately 1 % relative, and in the differ-
ence of X- coordinates (X
</p>
<p>L
&ndash;X
</p>
<p>R
) about 2 % relative. For 
</p>
<p>closely spaced features, the magnitude of this uncer-
tainty contribution will increase.
</p>
<p> 3. Uncertainty in the individual tilt settings: The magni-
tude of this uncertainty is dependent on the degree of 
backlash in the mechanical stage motions. Backlash

</p>
<p>effects can be minimized by selecting the initial (low) tilt 
value to correspond to a well-defined detent position if 
the mechanical stage is so designed, such as a physical 
stop at 0&deg; tilt. With a properly maintained mechanical 
stage, the uncertainty in the tilt angle difference Δθ is 
</p>
<p>estimated to be approximately 2 % for Δθ = 50, with the 
relative uncertainty increasing for smaller values of Δθ.
</p>
<p> 4. Considering all of these sources of uncertainty, the 
measurement should be assigned an overall uncertainty 
of &plusmn;5 % relative.

<p>7.1  Information in&nbsp;SEM Images
</p>
<p>Information in SEM images about specimen properties is 
conveyed when contrast in the backscattered and/or second-
ary electron signals is created by differences in the interac-
tion of the beam electrons between a specimen feature and its 
surroundings. The resulting differences in the backscattered 
and secondary electron signals (S) convey information about 
specimen properties through a variety of contrast mecha-
nisms. Contrast (C
</p>
<p>tr
) is defined as
</p>
<p>C S S S
tr
= ( )max min max&minus; /  
</p>
<p>(7.1)
</p>
<p>where is S
max
</p>
<p> is the larger of the signals. By this definition, 
0 &le; C
</p>
<p>tr
 &le; 1.
</p>
<p>Contrast can be conveyed in the signal by one or more of 
three different mechanisms:
 1. Number effects. Number effects refer to contrast which 
</p>
<p>arises as a result of different numbers of electrons leaving 
the specimen at different beam locations in response to 
changes in the specimen characteristics at those loca-
tions.
</p>
<p> 2. Trajectory effects. Trajectory effects refer to contrast 
resulting from differences in the paths the electrons 
travel after leaving the specimen.
</p>
<p> 3. Energy effects. Energy effects occur when the contrast is 
carried by a certain portion of the backscattered 
electron or secondary electron energy distribution. For 
example, the high-energy backscattered electrons are 
generally the most useful for imaging the specimen 
using contrast mechanisms such as atomic number 
contrast or crystallographic contrast. Low-energy 
</p>
<p>secondary electrons are likely to escape from a shallow 
surface region of a specimen and convey surface 
information.

<p>7.2.1  Atomic Number Contrast 
With&nbsp;Backscattered Electrons
</p>
<p>The monotonic dependence of electron backscattering upon 
atomic number (η vs. Z, shown in . Fig. 2.3) constitutes a 
number effect with predictable behavior that enables SEM 
imaging to reveal the compositional microstructure of a spec-
imen through the contrast mechanism variously known as 
&ldquo;atomic number contrast,&rdquo; &ldquo;compositional contrast,&rdquo; &ldquo;material 
contrast,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Z-contrast.&rdquo; Ideally, to observe unobscured 
atomic number contrast, the specimen should be flat so that 
topography does not independently modify electron back-
scattering. An example of atomic number contrast observed 
in a polished cross section of Raney nickel alloy using signal 
collected with a semiconductor backscattered electron (BSE) 
detector is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;7.1, where four regions with pro-
gressively higher gray levels can be identified. The systematic 
behavior of η versus Z allows the observer to confidently con-
clude that the average atomic number of these four regions 
increases as the average gray level increases. SEM/EDS micro-
analysis of these regions presented in . Table&nbsp; 7.1 gives the 
compositional results and calculated average atomic number,

<p>7.2.2  Calculating Atomic Number Contrast
</p>
<p>An SEM is typically equipped with a &ldquo;dedicated backscat-
tered electron detector&rdquo; (e.g., semiconductor or passive scin-
tillator) that produces a signal, S, proportional to the number 
of BSEs that strike it and thus to the backscattered electron 
coefficient, η, of the specimen. Note that other factors, such 
as the energy distribution of the BSEs, can also influence the 
detector response.
</p>
<p>If the detector responded only to the number of BSEs, the 
contrast C
</p>
<p>tr
, can be estimated as
</p>
<p>C S S S
tr max min max max min max
= ( ) = ( )&minus; &minus;/ /η η η
</p>
<p> 
(7.2)
</p>
<p>Values of the backscatter coefficient for E
0
 &ge; 10&nbsp;keV can be 
</p>
<p>conveniently estimated using the fit to η versus Z (Eq. 2.2). 
Note that for mixtures that are uniform at the atomic level 
(e.g., alloy solid solutions, compounds, glasses, etc.), the 
backscattered electron coefficient can be calculated from the 
mass fraction average of the atomic number inserted into Eq. 
2.2 (as illustrated for the Al-Fe-Ni phases listed in . Table&nbsp;7.1), 
or alternatively, from the mass fraction average of the pure 
element backscatter coefficients.
</p>
<p>The greater the difference in atomic number between two 
materials, the greater is the atomic number contrast. Consider 
two elements with a significant difference in atomic number, 
for example, Al (Z = 13, η = 0.152) and Cu (Z = 29, η = 0.302). 
From Eq. (7.1), the atomic number contrast between Al and 
Cu is estimated to be
</p>
<p>C

</p>
<p>(7.3)
</p>
<p>When the contrast is calculated between elements separated 
by one unit of atomic number, much lower values are found, 
which has an important consequence on establishing visibil-
ity, as discussed below. Note that the slope of η versus Z 
decreases as Z increases, so that the contrast (which is the 
slope of η vs. Z) between adjacent elements (ΔZ = 1) also 
decreases. For example, the contrast between Al (Z = 13, 
η = 0.152) and Si (Z = 14, η = 0.164) where the slope of η ver-
sus Z is relatively high is

</p>
<p>(7.4)
</p>
<p>A similar calculation for Cu (Z = 29, η = 0.302) and Zn (Z = 30, 
η = 0.310) where the slope of η versus Z is lower gives
</p>
<p>C
tr

</p>
<p> 
(7.5)
</p>
<p>For high atomic number elements, the slope of η versus Z 
approaches zero, so that a calculation for Pt (Z = 78, η = 0.484) 
and Au (Z = 79, η = 0.487) gives a very low contrast:

atomic number contrast for a unit change in Z as a function of Z.

<p>7.2.3  BSE Atomic Number Contrast 
With&nbsp;the&nbsp;Everhart&ndash;Thornley Detector

<p>The appearance of atomic number contrast for a polished cross 
section of Al-Cu aligned eutectic, which consists of an Al-2 % 
Cu solid solution and the intermetallic CuAl
</p>
<p>2
, is shown as 
</p>
<p>viewed with a semiconductor BSE detector in . Fig.&nbsp;7.3a and an 
Everhart&ndash;Thornley detector (positively biased) in . Fig.&nbsp;7.3b. 
The E&ndash;T detector is usually thought of as a secondary electron 
detector, and while it captures the SE
</p>
<p>1
 signal, it also captures 
</p>
<p>BSEs that are directly emitted into the solid angle defined by the 
scintillator. Additionally, BSEs are also represented in the E&ndash;T 
detector signal by the large contribution of SE
</p>
<p>2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
, which 
</p>
<p>are actually BSE-modulated signals. Thus, although the SE
1
 sig-
</p>
<p>nal of the E&ndash;T detector does not show predictable variation 
with composition, the BSE components of the E&ndash;T signal reveal 
the atomic number contrast seen in . Fig.&nbsp; 7.3b. It must be 
noted, however, that because of the sensitivity of the E&ndash;T detec-
tor to edge effects and topography, these fine-scale features are 
much more visible in . Fig.&nbsp;7.3b than in . Fig.&nbsp;7.3a.
</p>
<p>For both the dedicated semiconductor BSE detector and 
the E&ndash;T detector, the higher atomic number regions appear 
brighter than the lower atomic number regions, as indepen-
dently confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry of 
both materials. However, the semiconductor BSE detector

mated from the composition (Al-0.02Cu, η = 0.155; CuAl
</p>
<p>2
, 
</p>
<p>η = 0.232, which gives C
tr
</p>
<p> = 0.33). The semiconductor detec-
tor shows increased response from higher energy backscat-
tered electrons, which are produced in greater relative 
abundance from Cu compared to Al, thus enhancing the dif-
ference in the measured signals. The response of the Everhart- 
Thornley detector (positive bias) to BSEs is more complex. 
The BSEs that directly strike the scintillator produce a greater 
response with increasing energy. However, this component is 
small compared to the BSEs that strike the objective lens pole 
piece and chamber walls, where they are converted to SE
</p>
<p>3
 
</p>
<p>and subsequently collected. For these remote BSEs, the lower 
energy fraction actually create SEs more efficiently.
</p>
<p>7.3  Interpretation of&nbsp;SEM Images 
of&nbsp;Specimen Topography
</p>
<p>Imaging the topographic features of specimens is one of the 
most important applications of the SEM, enabling the 
microscopist to gain information on size and shape of fea-
tures. Topographic contrast has several components arising 
from both backscattered electrons and secondary electrons:
 1. The backscattered electron coefficient shows a strong 
</p>
<p>dependence on the surface inclination, η versus θ. This 
effect contributes a number component to the observed 
contrast.
</p>
<p> 2. Backscattering from a surface perpendicular to the 
beam (i.e., 0&deg; tilt) is directional and follows a cosine

<p>distribution η(φ) &asymp; cos φ (where φ is an angle measured 
from the surface normal) that is rotationally symmetric 
around the beam. This effect contributes a trajectory 
component of contrast.
</p>
<p> 3. Backscattering from a surface tilted to an angle θ 
becomes more highly directional and asymmetrical as θ 
increases, tending to peak in the forward scattering 
direction. This effect contributes a trajectory component 
of contrast.
</p>
<p> 4. The secondary electron coefficient δ is strongly depen-
dent on the surface inclination, δ(θ) &asymp; sec θ, increasing 
rapidly as the beam approaches grazing incidence. This 
effect contributes a number component of contrast.
</p>
<p>Imaging of topography should be regarded as qualitative in 
nature because the details of the image such as shading 
depend not only on the specimen characteristics but also 
upon the response of the particular electron detector as 
well as its location and solid angle of acceptance. 
Nevertheless, the interpretation of all SEM images of 
topography is based on two principles regardless of the 
detector being used:
 1. Observer&rsquo;s Point-of-View: The microscopist views the 
</p>
<p>specimen features as if looking along the electron beam.
 2. Apparent Illumination of the Scene:
</p>
<p> a. The apparent major source of lighting of the 
scene comes from the position of the electron 
detector.
</p>
<p> b. Depending on the detector used, there may appear to 
be minor illumination sources coming from other 
directions.
</p>
<p>7.3.1  Imaging Specimen Topography 
With&nbsp;the&nbsp;Everhart&ndash;Thornley Detector
</p>
<p>SEM images of specimen topography collected with the 
Everhart&ndash;Thornley (positive bias) detector (Everhart and 
Thornley 1960) are surprisingly easy to interpret, considering 
how drastically the imaging technique differs from ordinary 
human visual experience: A finely focused electron beam steps 
sequentially through a series of locations on the specimen and a 
mixture of the backscattered electron and secondary electron 
signals, subject to the four number and trajectory effects noted 
above that result from complex beam&ndash;specimen interactions, is 
used to create the gray-scale image on the display. Nevertheless, 
a completely untrained observer (even a young child) can be 
reasonably expected to intuitively understand the general shape 
of a three-dimensional object from the details of the pattern of 
highlights and shading in the SEM/E&ndash;T (positive bias) image. 
In fact, the appearance of a three-dimensional object viewed in 
an SEM/E&ndash;T (positive bias) image is strikingly similar to the 
view that would be obtained if that object were viewed with a 
conventional light source and the human eye, producing the so-
called &ldquo;light- optical analogy.&rdquo; This situation is quite remarkable, 
and the relative ease with which SEM/E&ndash;T (positive bias) 
images can be utilized is a major source of the utility and popu-
larity of the SEM.&nbsp;It is important to understand the origin of this 
SEM/E&ndash;T (positive bias) light-optical analogy and what patho-
logical effects can occur to diminish or destroy the effect, pos-
sibly leading to incorrect image interpretation of topography.

and secondary electron emission (type SE
</p>
<p>1
 produced by the 
</p>
<p>beam electrons entering the specimen and type SE
2
 produced 
</p>
<p>by the exiting BSEs). Energetic BSEs carrying at least a few 
kilo-electronvolts of kinetic energy that directly strike the 
E&ndash;T scintillator are always detected, even if the scintillator is 
passive with no positive accelerating potential applied. In 
typical operation the E&ndash;T detector is operated with a large 
positive accelerating potential (+10&nbsp; kV or higher) on the 
scintillator and a small positive bias (e.g., +300&nbsp; V) on the 
Faraday cage which surrounds the scintillator. The small 
positive bias on the cage attracts SEs with high efficiency to 
the detector. Once they pass inside the Faraday cage, the SEs 
are accelerated to detectable kinetic energy by the high posi-
tive potential applied to the face of the scintillator. In addi-
tion to the SE
</p>
<p>1
 and SE
</p>
<p>2
 signals produced at the specimen, the 
</p>
<p>E&ndash;T (positive bias) detector also collects some of the remotely 
produced SE
</p>
<p>3
 which are generated where the BSEs strike the 
</p>
<p>objective lens and the walls of the specimen chamber. Thus, 
in . Fig.&nbsp;7.4 a feature such as face &ldquo;A,&rdquo; which is tilted toward 
the E&ndash;T detector, scatters some BSEs directly to the scintilla-
tor, which add to the SE

</p>
<p>3
 signals that are also

<p>collected, making &ldquo;A&rdquo; appear especially bright compared to 
face &ldquo;B.&rdquo; Because &ldquo;B&rdquo; is tilted away from the E&ndash;T (positive 
bias) detector, it does not make a direct BSE contribution, but 
some SE
</p>
<p>1
 and SE
</p>
<p>2
 signals will be collected from &ldquo;B&rdquo; by the 
</p>
<p>Faraday cage potential, which causes SEs to follow curving 
trajectories, while remote SE
</p>
<p>3
 signals from face &ldquo;B&rdquo; will also 
</p>
<p>be collected. Only features the electron beam does not 
directly strike, such as the re-entrant feature &ldquo;C,&rdquo; will fail to 
generate any collectable signal and thus appear black.

<p>illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;7.4 effectively illuminates the specimen 
in a way similar to the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; landscape scene illus-
trated schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;7.5 (Oatley 1972). A viewer in 
an airplane looks down on a hilly landscape that is direction-
ally illuminated by the Sun at a shallow (oblique) angle, high-
lighting sloping hillsides such as &ldquo;A,&rdquo; while a general pattern 
of diffuse light originates from scattering of sunlight by 
clouds and the atmosphere that illuminates all features, 
including those not in the direct path of the sunlight, such 
as hillside &ldquo;B,&rdquo; while the cave &ldquo;C&rdquo; receives no illumination. 
To establish this light-optical analogy, we must match com-
ponents with similar characteristics:
 1. The human observer&rsquo;s eye, which has a very sharply 
</p>
<p>defined line-of-sight, is matched in characteristic by the 
electron beam, which presents a very narrow cone angle 
of rays: thus, the observer of an SEM image is effectively 
looking along the beam, and what the beam can strike is 
what can be observed in an image.
</p>
<p> 2. The illumination of an outdoor scene by the Sun consists 
of a direct component (direct rays that strongly light 
those surfaces that they strike) and an indirect compo-
nent (diffuse scattering of the Sun&rsquo;s rays from clouds and 
the atmosphere, weakly illuminating the scene from all 
angles). For the E&ndash;T detector (positive bias), there is a 
direct signal component that acts like the Sun (BSEs 
emitted by the specimen into the solid angle defined by 
the scintillator, as well as SE

<p>struck by BSEs).
</p>
<p>Though counterintuitive, in the SEM the detector is the 
apparent source of illumination while the observer looks 
along the electron beam.
</p>
<p> Establishing a&nbsp;Robust Light-Optical Analogy
</p>
<p>The human visual process has developed in a world of top 
lighting (. Fig.&nbsp;7.6): sunlight comes from above in the out-
doors; our indoor environment is illuminated from light 
sources on the ceiling or lamp fixtures placed above our com-
fortable reading chair. We instinctively expect that brightly 
illuminated features must be facing upward to receive light 
from the source above, while poorly illuminated features are 
facing away from the light source. Thus, to establish the 
strongest possible light-optical analogy for the SEM/E&ndash;T 
(positive bias) image, we need to create a situation of appar-
ent top lighting. Because the strong source of apparent illu-
mination in an SEM image appears to come from the detector 
(direct BSEs, SE
</p>
<p>1,
 and SE
</p>
<p>2
 for an E&ndash;T [positive bias] detec-
</p>
<p>tor), by ensuring that the effective location of the E&ndash;T detec-
tor is at the top of the SEM image field as it is presented to the 
viewer, any feature facing the E&ndash;T detector will appear bright, 
thus establishing that the apparent lighting of the scene pre-
sented to the viewer will be from above. All features that can 
be reached by the electron beam will produce some signal, 
even those facing away from the E&ndash;T (positive bias) detector 
or that are screened by local topography, through the 
</p>
<p> collection of the SE
3
 component. Thus, if we imagine the 
</p>
<p>specimen scene to be illuminated by a primary light source, 
then that light source occupies the position of the E&ndash;T detec-
tor and the viewer of that scene is looking along the electron 
beam. The SE
</p>
<p>3
 component of the signal provides a general 
</p>
<p>diffuse secondary source of illumination that appears to 
come from all directions.
</p>
<p> Getting It Wrong: Breaking the&nbsp;Light-Optical 
Analogy of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Everhart&ndash;Thornley (Positive 
Bias) Detector
</p>
<p>If the microscopist is not careful, it is possible to break the 
light-optical analogy of the Everhart-Thornley (positive bias) 
detector. This situation can arise through improper collec-
tion of the image by misuse of the feature called &ldquo;Scan 
Rotation&rdquo; (or in subsequent off-line image modification with 
image processing software). &ldquo;Scan Rotation&rdquo; is a commonly 
available feature of nearly all SEM systems that allows the 
microscopist to arbitrarily orient an image on the display 
screen. While this may seem to be a useful feature that 
enables the presentation of the features of a specimen in a 
more aesthetically pleasing manner (e.g., aligning a fiber 
along the long axis of a rectangular image), scan rotation 
changes the apparent position of the E&ndash;T detector (indeed, 
of all detectors) in the image with potentially serious conse-
quences that can compromise the light-optical analogy of 
the E&ndash;T (positive bias) detector. The observer is naturally 
accustomed to having top illumination when interpreting 
images of topography, that is, the apparent source of illumi-
nation coming from the top of the field-of-view and shining

<p>down on the features of the specimen. When the top lighting 
condition is violated and the observer is unaware of the 
alteration of the scene illumination, then the sense of the 
topography can appear inverted. Arbitrary scan rotation can 
effectively place the E&ndash;T detector, or any other asymmetri-
cally placed (i.e., off-axis) detector, at the bottom or sides of 
the image, and if the observer is unaware of this situation of 
unfamiliar illumination, misinterpretation of the specimen 
topography is likely to result. This is especially true in the 
case of specimens for which there are limited visual clues. 
For example, the SEM image of an insect contains many 
familiar features&mdash;e.g., head, eyes, legs, etc.&mdash;that make it 
almost impossible to invert the topography regardless of the 
</p>
<p>apparent lighting. By comparison, the image of an undulat-
ing surface of an unknown object may provide no clues that 
cause the proper sense of the topography to &ldquo;click in&rdquo; for the 
observer. Having top illumination is critical in such cases. 
When a microscopist works in a multi-user facility, the pos-
sibility must always be considered that a previous user may 
have arbitrarily adjusted the scan rotation. As part of a per-
sonal quality- assurance plan, the careful microscopist should 
confirm that the location of the E&ndash;T detector is at the top 
center of the image. . Figure&nbsp;7.7 demonstrates a procedure 
that enables unambiguous location of the E&ndash;T detector. 
Some (but not all) implementations of the E&ndash;T detector 
enable the user to &ldquo;deconstruct&rdquo; the E&ndash;T detector image by

<p>selectively excluding the SE component of the total signal&mdash;
either by changing the Faraday cage voltage to negative val-
ues to reject the very low energy SEs (e.g., &minus;50&nbsp;V cage bias) 
or by eliminating the high potential on the scintillator so that 
SEs cannot be accelerated to sufficient kinetic energy to 
excite scintillation. Even without the high potential applied 
to the scintillator, the E&ndash;T detector remains sensitive to the 
high energy BSEs generated by a high energy primary beam, 
for example., E
</p>
<p>0
 &ge; 20&nbsp; keV, which creates a large fraction of 
</p>
<p>BSEs with energy &gt;10&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;As a passive scintillator or with 
the negative Faraday cage potential applied, the E&ndash;T (nega-
tive bias) detector only collects the small fraction of high 
energy BSEs scattered into the solid angle defined by the E&ndash;T 
scintillator. When the direct BSE mode of the E&ndash;T (negative 
bias) detector is selected, debris on a flat surface is found to 
create distinct shadows that point away from the apparent 
source of illumination, the E&ndash;T detector. By using the scan 
rotation, the effective position of the E&ndash;T detector can then 
be moved to the top of the image, as shown in the sequence 
of . Fig.&nbsp;7.7a&ndash;c, thus achieving the desired top-lighting situ-
ation. When the conventional E&ndash;T (positive bias) is used to 
image this same field of view (. Fig.&nbsp;7.7d), the strong shadow 
of the particle disappears because of the efficient collection 
of SEs, particularly the SE
</p>
<p>3
 component, and now has a bright 
</p>
<p>edge along the top which reinforces the impression that it 
rises above the general surface.
</p>
<p>Note that physically rotating the specimen stage to change 
the angular relation of the specimen relative to the E&ndash;T (or 
any other) detector does not change the location of the appar-
ent source of illumination in the displayed image. Rotating 
the specimen stage changes which specimen features are 
directed toward the detector, but the scan orientation on the 
displayed image determines the relative position of the detec-
tor in the image presented to the viewer and the apparent 
direction of the illumination.
</p>
<p> Deconstructing the&nbsp;SEM/E&ndash;T Image 
of&nbsp;Topography
</p>
<p>It is often useful to examine the separate SE and BSE compo-
nents of the E&ndash;T detector image. An example of a blocky 
fragment of pyrite (FeS
</p>
<p>2
) imaged with a positively-biased 
</p>
<p>E&ndash;T detector is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;7.8a. In this image, the effec-
tive position of the E&ndash;T detector relative to the presentation 
of the image is at the top center. . Figure&nbsp;7.8b shows the same 
field of view with the Faraday cage biased negatively to 
exclude SEs so that only direct BSEs contribute to the SEM 
image. The image contrast is now extremely harsh, since 
topographic features facing toward the detector are illumi-
nated, while those facing away are completely lost. Comparing 
. Fig.&nbsp;7.8a, b, the features that appear bright in the BSE-only 
image are also brighter in the full BSE + SE image obtained 
with the positively biased E&ndash;T detector, demonstrating the 
presence of the direct-BSE component. The much softer con-
trast of nearly all surfaces seen in the BSE + SE image of 
</p>
<p>. Fig.&nbsp; 7.8a demonstrates the efficiency of the E&ndash;T detector 
for collection of signal from virtually all surfaces of the spec-
imen that the primary beam strikes.
</p>
<p>7.3.3  Imaging Specimen Topography 
With&nbsp;a&nbsp;Semiconductor BSE Detector
</p>
<p>A segmented (A and B semicircular segments) semiconduc-
tor BSE detector placed directly above the specimen is illus-
trated schematically in . Fig.&nbsp; 7.9. This BSE detector is 
mounted below the final lens and is placed symmetrically 
around the beam, so that in the summation mode it acts as 
an annular detector. A simple topographic specimen is illus-
trated, oriented so that the left face directs BSEs toward the 
A-segment, while the right face directs BSEs toward the 
B-segment. This A and B detector pair is typically arranged 
so that one of the segments, &ldquo;A,&rdquo; is oriented so that it appears 
to illuminate from the top of the image, while the &ldquo;B&rdquo; seg-
ment appears to illuminate from the bottom of the image. 
The segmented detector enables selection of several modes 
of operation: SUM mode (A + B), DIFFERENCE mode 
(A&minus;B), and individual detectors A or B) (Kimoto and 
Hashimoto 1966).
</p>
<p> SUM Mode (A + B)
</p>
<p>The two-segment semiconductor BSE detector operating in 
the summation (A + B) mode was used to image the same 
pyrite specimen previously imaged with the E&ndash;T (positive 
bias) and E&ndash;T (negative bias), as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 7.8c. The 
placement of the large solid angle BSE is so close to the pri-
mary electron beam that it creates the effect of apparent 
wide-angle illumination that is highly directional along the 
line-of-sight of the observer, which would be the light-optical 
equivalent of being inside a flashlight looking along the 
beam. With such directional illumination along the observ-
er&rsquo;s line-of-sight, the brightest topographic features are those 
oriented perpendicular to the line-of-sight, while tilted sur-
faces appear darker, resulting in a substantially different 
impression of the topography of the pyrite specimen com-
pared to the E&ndash;T (positive bias) image in . Fig.&nbsp; 7.8a. The 
large solid angle of the detector acts to suppress topographic 
contrast, since local differences in the directionality of BSE 
emission caused by differently inclined surfaces are effec-
tively eliminated when the diverging BSEs are intercepted by 
another part of the large BSE detector.
</p>
<p>Another effect that is observed in the A + B image is the 
class of very bright inclusions which were subsequently 
determined to be galena (PbS) by X-ray microanalysis. The 
large difference in average atomic number between FeS
</p>
<p>2
 
</p>
<p>(Z
av
</p>
<p> = 20.7) and PbS (Z
av
</p>
<p> = 73.2) results in strong atomic 
number (compositional) between the PbS inclusions and the 
FeS
</p>
<p>2
 matrix. Although there is a significant BSE signal com-

<p> Examining Images Prepared 
With&nbsp;the&nbsp;Individual Detector Segments
</p>
<p>Some semiconductor BSE detector systems enable the 
microscopist to view BSE images prepared with the signal 
derived from the individual components of a segmented 
</p>
<p>detector. As illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;7.9 for a two-segment BSE 
detector, the individual segments effectively provide an off- 
axis, asymmetric illumination of the specimen. Comparing 
the A-segment and B-segment images of the pyrite crystal in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 7.8d, e, the features facing each detector can be dis-
cerned and a sense of the topography can be obtained by 
comparing the two images. But note the strong effect of the 
apparent inversion of the sense of the topography in the

</p>
<p>B-segment image, where the illumination comes from the 
bottom of the field, compared to the A-segment image, where 
the illumination comes from the top of the field of view.
</p>
<p> DIFFERENCE Mode (A&minus;B)
</p>
<p>The signals from the individual BSE detector segments &ldquo;A&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;B&rdquo; can be subtracted from each other, producing the image 
seen in . Fig.&nbsp;7.8f. Because the detector segments &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; 
effectively illuminate the specimen from two different direc-
tions, as seen in . Fig.&nbsp; 7.8d, e, taking the difference A&ndash;B 
between the detector signals tends to enhance these directional 
differences, producing the strong contrast seen in . Fig.&nbsp;7.8f.
</p>
<p>Note that when subtracting the signals the order of the 
segments in the subtraction has a profound effect on appear-
ance of the final image. . Figure&nbsp;7.8g shows the image created 
with the order of subtraction reversed to give B&ndash;A.&nbsp;Because 
the observer is so strongly biased toward interpreting an 
image as if it must have top lighting, bright  features are 
automatically interpreted as facing upward. This automatic 
</p>
<p>assumption of top lighting has the effect for most viewers 
of . Fig.&nbsp; 7.8g to strongly invert the apparent sense of the 
topography, so that protuberances in the A&ndash;B image become 
concavities in the B&ndash;A image. If BSE detector difference 
images are to be at all useful and not misleading, it is critical 
to determine the proper order of subtraction. A suitable test 
procedure is to image a specimen with known topography, 
such as the raised lettering on a coin or a particle standing on 
top of a flat surface.

<p>The detection in SEM images of specimen features such as 
compositional differences, topography (shape, inclination, 
edges, etc.), and physical differences (crystal orientation, 
magnetic fields, electrical fields, etc.), depends on satisfying 
two criteria: (1) establishing the minimum conditions neces-
sary to ensure that the contrast created by the beam&ndash;speci-
men interaction responding to differences in specimen 
features is statistically significant in the imaging signal (back-
scattered electrons [BSE], secondary electrons [SE], or a 
combination) compared to the inevitable random signal fluc-
tuations (noise); and (2) applying appropriate signal process-
ing and digital image processing to render the contrast 
information that exists in the signal visible to the observer 
viewing the final image display.
</p>
<p>8.1  Signal Quality: Threshold Contrast 
and&nbsp;Threshold Current
</p>
<p>An SEM image is constructed by addressing the beam to a 
specific location on the specimen for a fixed dwell time, τ, 
during which a number of beam electrons are injected 
through the focused beam footprint into the specimen. The 
resulting beam&ndash;specimen interactions cause the emission of 
BSE and SE, a fraction of which will be detected and mea-
sured with appropriate electron detectors. This measured BSE 
and/or SE signal is then assigned to that pixel as it is digitally 
stored and subsequently displayed as a gray-level image. Both 
the incident electron beam current and the measured BSE 
and/or SE signals, Si, involve discrete numbers of electrons: 
n
</p>
<p>B
, n
</p>
<p>BSE
, and n
</p>
<p>SE
. The emission of the incident beam current 
</p>
<p>from the electron gun and the subsequent BSE/SE generation 
due to elastic and inelastic scattering in the specimen are sto-
chastic processes; that is, the mechanisms are subject to ran-
dom variations over time. Thus, repeated sampling of any 
imaging signal, S, made at the same specimen location with 
</p>
<p>the same nominal beam current and dwell time will produce 
a range of values distributed about a mean count n, with the 
standard deviation of this distribution described by n1 2/ . 
This natural variation in repeated samplings of the signal S is 
termed &ldquo;noise,&rdquo; N. The measure of the signal quality is termed 
the &ldquo;signal-to-noise ratio,&rdquo; S/N, given by
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>N
n n n= =/ / /1 2 1 2
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(8.1)
</p>
<p>Equation (8.1) shows that as the mean number of collected 
signal counts increases, the signal quality S/N improves as 
the random fluctuations become a progressively smaller frac-
tion of the total signal.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp; 8.1 shows schematically the result of repeated 
scans over a series of pixels that cross a feature of interest. The 
signal value S changes in response to the change in the speci-
men property (composition, topography, etc.), but the 
repeated scans do not produce exactly the same response due 
to the inevitable noise in the signal generation processes. 
When an observer views a scanned image, this noise is super-
imposed on the legitimate changes in signal (contrast) of 
features in the image, reducing the visibility. Rose (1948) 
made an extensive study of the ability of observers viewing 
scanned television images to detect the contrast between 
objects of different size and the background in the presence 
of various levels of noise. Rose found that for the average 
observer to distinguish small objects with dimensions about 
5 % of the image width against the background, the change in 
signal due to the contrast, ΔS, had to exceed the noise, N, by 
a factor of 5:

objects. . Figure&nbsp; 8.2a shows a synthesized object from the

to N. In . Fig.&nbsp;8.3b ΔS = 5 = N; . Fig.&nbsp;8.3c ΔS = 10 = 2 N; and 
. Fig.&nbsp;8.3d ΔS = 25 = 5 N, which just matches the Rose crite-
rion. While the large-scale features are visible in all three 
images, the fine-scale objects are completely lost in image 
. Fig.&nbsp;8.3b, and only fully visible when the Rose criterion is 
satisfied in image . Fig.&nbsp;8.3d.
</p>
<p>The Rose visibility criterion can be used as the basis to 
develop the quantitative relation between the threshold con-
trast, that is, the minimum level of contrast potentially visible 
in the signal, and the beam current. The noise can be consid-
ered in terms of the number of signal events, N = n1/2:

Alternatively, if we measure the current which is available in 
the beam that reaches the specimen (e.g., with a Faraday cup 
and specimen current picoammeter), then we can calculate the 
minimum contrast, the so-called &ldquo;threshold contrast,&rdquo; which 
can be observed in an image prepared under these conditions. 
Objects in the field of view that do not produce this threshold 
contrast cannot be distinguished from the noise of random 
background fluctuations. Equations (8.12 and 8.13) lead to the 
following critical limitation on SEM imaging performance:
</p>
<p>For any particular selection of operating parameters&mdash;
beam current, signal (backscattered electrons, secondary elec-
trons, or a combination), detector performance (DQE), image 
pixel density and dwell time&mdash;there is always a level of contrast 
below which objects cannot be detected. Objects producing 
contrast below this threshold contrast cannot be recovered by 
applying any post-collection image-processing algorithms.

<p>of the contrast) provide a useful way to understand the rela-
tionships of the parameters of the Threshold Equation. These 
plots have been derived from Eq. (8.13) with the assumptions 
that the image has 1024 by 1024&nbsp;pixels and the overall signal 
generation/collection efficiency (the product of η and/or δ 
and the DQE) is 0.25; that is, one signal-carrying electron 
(backscattered and/or secondary) is registered in the final 
image for every four beam electrons that strike the specimen. 
This collection efficiency is a reasonable assumption for a tar-
get, such as gold, which has high backscattering and second-
ary electron coefficients, when the electrons are detected with 
an efficient positively-biased E&ndash;T detector. . Figure&nbsp; 8.4 
reveals that imaging a contrast level of C = 0.10 (10 %) with a 
frame time of 1&nbsp;s (a pixel dwell time of ~1&nbsp;μs for a 1024 &times; 1024- 
pixel scan) requires a beam current in excess of 1&nbsp;nA, whereas 
if 100&nbsp;s is used for the frame time (pixel dwell time of ~100&nbsp;μs), 
the required beam current falls to about 10&nbsp;pA.&nbsp;If the speci-
men only produces a contrast level of 0.05 (5%), a beam 
 current above 5&nbsp;nA must be used. Conversely, if a particular 
value of the beam current is selected, . Fig.&nbsp;8.5 demonstrates 
that there will always be a level of contrast below which objects 
will be effectively invisible. For example, if a beam current of 
1&nbsp;nA is used for a 10-s frame time, all objects producing con-
</p>
<p>trast less than approximately 0.05 (5 %) against the back-
ground will be lost. Once the current required to image a 
specific contrast level is known from the Threshold Equation, 
the minimum beam size that contains this current can be esti-
mated with the Brightness Equation. A severe penalty in 
minimum probe size is incurred when the contrast is low 
because of the requirement for high beam current needed to 
exceed the threshold current. Moreover, this ideal beam size 
will be increased due to the aberrations that degrade electron 
optical performance.
</p>
<p>The Rose criterion is actually a conservative estimate of 
visibility threshold conditions since it is appropriate for small 
discrete features with linear dimensions down to a few per-
cent of the image width or small details on larger structures. 
For objects that constitute a large fraction of the image or 
which have an extended linear nature, such as an edge or a 
fiber, the ability of an observer&rsquo;s visual process to effectively 
combine information over many contiguous pixels actually 
relaxes the visibility criterion, as illustrated in the synthesized 
images in . Fig.&nbsp;8.3 (Bright et&nbsp;al. 1998). The effect of the size 
of a feature on visibility of real features can be seen in 
. Figs.&nbsp;8.6 and 8.7, which show BSE images (semiconductor 
detector) of a commercial aluminum&ndash;silicon eutectic casting

<p>(0.14&minus;0.13)/0.14 &asymp; 0.07 or 7 % contrast. As the beam current 
is decreased with fixed frame time (. Fig.&nbsp;8.6) or the frame 
time is decreased with fixed beam current (. Fig.&nbsp; 8.7), the 
visibility of the fine- scale features at the right-hand side of 
the image diminishes and these small features are eventually 
lost, whereas the large-scale features on the left-hand side of 
the image remain visible over the range of experimental 
parameters despite having the same compositional difference 
and thus producing the same contrast.
</p>
<p>While the Threshold Equation provides &ldquo;gray numbers&rdquo; 
for the threshold parameters due to the variability of the 
human observer and the relative size of objects, the impact of 
the Threshold Equation must be considered in developing 
imaging strategy. Unfortunately, poor imaging strategy can 
render the SEM completely ineffective in detecting the fea-
tures of interest. A careful imaging strategy will first estimate 
the likely level of contrast from the objects of interest (or 
assume the worst possible case that the features being sought 
produce very low contrast, e.g., &lt;0.01) and then select instru-
ment parameters capable of detecting that contrast. An 
</p>
<p>example is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;8.8, which shows a sequence of 
images of a polished carbon planchet upon which a droplet 
containing a dilute salt was deposited by inkjet printing. The 
images were prepared at constant beam current but with 
increasing pixel dwell time, which represents a section 
through the Threshold Equation plot shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 8.9. 
Even the largest-scale features are lost in the image prepared 
with the shortest dwell time. Careful study of these images 
reveals that new information is being added throughout the 
image sequence, and likely there would be additional infor-
mation recovered with further increases in the pixel time or 
by increasing the beam current.
</p>
<p>Finally, it must be recognized that there is a substantial 
&ldquo;observer effect&rdquo; for objects producing contrast near the 
threshold of visibility: different observers may have substan-
tially different success in detecting features in images (Bright 
et&nbsp;al. 1998). Thus the threshold current or threshold contrast 
calculated with Eq. (8.12) should be considered a &ldquo;fuzzy 
number&rdquo; rather than an absolute threshold, since visibility 
depends on several factors, including the size and shape of 
the features of interest as well as the visual acuity of the par-
ticular observer and his/her experience in evaluating images.

<p>observer effect mean that a negative result in an SEM study, 
that is, the failure to find an expected feature in an image, 
may occur because of the choice of imaging conditions and 
the observer&rsquo;s limitations, not because the feature does not 
exist in the specimen under study. Thus, best practices in 
SEM imaging of low contrast features must include a com-
prehensive strategy to systematically vary the imaging 
parameters, including beam current and dwell time, to be 
sure that the visibility threshold is adequately exceeded 
before an object can be declared to be absent with a high 
degree of confidence.

<p>SEM images are subject to defects that can arise from a vari-
ety of mechanisms, including charging, radiation damage, 
contamination, and moir&eacute; fringe effects, among others. 
Image defects are very dependent on the specific nature of 
the specimen, and often they are anecdotal, experienced but 
not reported in the SEM literature. The examples described 
below are not a complete catalog but are presented to alert 
the microscopist to the possibility of such image defects so as 
to avoid interpreting artifact as fact.
</p>
<p>9.1  Charging
</p>
<p>Charging is one of the major image defects commonly 
encountered in SEM imaging, especially when using the 
Everhart&ndash;Thornley (positive bias) &ldquo;secondary electron&rdquo; 
detector, which is especially sensitive to even slight charging.
</p>
<p>9.1.1  What Is Specimen Charging?
</p>
<p>The specimen can be thought of as an electrical junction into 
which the beam current, i
</p>
<p>B
, flows. The phenomena of back-
</p>
<p>scattering of the beam electrons and secondary electron 
emission represent currents flowing out of the junction, i
</p>
<p>BSE
 
</p>
<p>(= η i
B
) and i
</p>
<p>SE
 (= δ i
</p>
<p>B
). For a copper target and an incident 
</p>
<p>beam energy of 20&nbsp; keV, η is approximately 0.3 and δ is 
approximately 0.1, which together account for 0.4 or 40 % of 
the charges injected into the specimen by the beam current. 
The remaining beam current must flow from the specimen to 
ground to avoid the accumulation of charge in the junction 
(Kirchoff &rsquo;s current law). The balance of the currents for a 
non-charging junction is then given by
</p>
<p>&sum; &sum;=i iin out
i i i i
B BSE SE SC
= + +  (9.1)
</p>
<p>where i
SC
</p>
<p> is the specimen (or absorbed) current. For the 
example of copper, i
</p>
<p>SC
 = 0.6 i
</p>
<p>B
.
</p>
<p>The specimen stage is typically constructed so that the 
specimen is electrically isolated from electrical ground to 
permit various measurements. A wire connection to the 
stage establishes the conduction path for the specimen cur-
rent to travel to the electrical ground. This design enables a 
current meter to be installed in this path to ground, allowing 
direct measurement of the specimen current and enabling 
measurement of the true beam current with a Faraday cup 
(which captures all electrons that enter it) in place of the 
specimen. Moreover, this specimen current signal can be 
used to form an image of the specimen (see the &ldquo;Electron 
Detectors&rdquo; module) However, if the electrical path from the 
specimen surface to ground is interrupted, the conditions for 
charge balance in Eq. (9.1) cannot be established, even if the 
specimen is a metallic conductor. The electrons injected into 
the specimen by the beam will then accumulate, and the 
specimen will develop a high negative electrical charge 
</p>
<p>relative to ground. The electrical field from this negative 
charge will decelerate the incoming beam electrons, and in 
extreme cases the specimen will actually act like an electron 
mirror. The scanning beam will be reflected before reaching 
the surface, so that it actually scans the inside of the speci-
men chamber, creating an image that reveals the objective 
lens, detectors, and other features of the specimen chamber, 
as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;9.1.
</p>
<p>If the electrical path to ground is established, then the 
excess charges will be dissipated in the form of the specimen 
current provided the specimen has sufficient conductivity. 
Because all materials (except superconductors) have the 
property of electrical resistivity, ρ, the specimen has a resis-
tance R (R = ρ L/A, where L is the length of the specimen and 
A is the cross section), and the passage of the specimen cur-
rent, i
</p>
<p>SC
, through this resistance will cause a potential drop 
</p>
<p>across the specimen, V = i
SC
</p>
<p> R. For a metal, ρ is typically of 
the order of 10&minus;6 Ω-cm, so that a specimen 1-cm thick with a 
cross-sectional area of 1&nbsp;cm2 will have a resistance of 10&minus;6 Ω, 
and a beam current of 1&nbsp;nA (10&minus;9&nbsp;A) will cause a potential of 
about 10&minus;15&nbsp; V to develop across the specimen. For a high 
purity (undoped) semiconductor such as silicon or germa-
nium, ρ is approximately 104 to 106 Ω-cm, and the 1-nA 
beam will cause a potential of 1&nbsp; mV (10&minus;3&nbsp; V) or less to 
develop across the 1-cm cube specimen, which is still negli-
gible. The flow of the specimen current to ground becomes a 
critical problem when dealing with non-conducting (insulat-
ing) specimens. Insulating specimens include a very wide 
variety of materials such as plastics, polymers, elastomers, 
minerals, rocks, glasses, ceramics, and others, which may be 
encountered as bulk solids, porous solids, foams, particles, or 
fibers. Virtually all biological specimens become non-con-
ducting when water is removed by drying, substitution with 
low vapor pressure polymers, or frozen in place. For an insu-
lator such as an oxide, ρ is very high, 106 to 1016 Ω-cm, which 
prevents the smooth motion of the electrons injected by the 
beam through the specimen to ground; electrons accumulate

<p>9.1.2  Recognizing Charging Phenomena 
in&nbsp;SEM Images
</p>
<p>Charging phenomena cover a wide range of observed behav-
iors in SEM images of imperfectly conducting specimens. 
Secondary electrons (SEs) are emitted with very low energy, 
by definition E
</p>
<p>SE
 &lt; 50&nbsp; eV, with most carrying less than 
</p>
<p>5&nbsp; eV.&nbsp; Such low energy, slow-moving SEs can be strongly 
deflected by local electrical fields caused by charging. The 
Everhart&ndash;Thornley (positive bias) detector collects SEs by 
means of a positive potential of a few hundred volts (e.g., 
+300&nbsp;V) applied to the Faraday cage at a distance of several 
centimeters (e.g., 3&nbsp;cm) from the specimen, creating an elec-
trical field at the specimen of approximately 104&nbsp;V/m. SEs 
emitted from a conducting specimen are strongly attracted 
to follow the field lines from the grounded specimen surface 
to the positively biased Faraday cage grid, and thus into the 
high voltage field applied to the face of the scintillator of the 
Everhart&ndash;Thornley (E&ndash;T) detector. If the specimen charges 
locally to develop even a few volts&rsquo; potential, the local elec-
trical field from the charged region relative to nearby 
uncharged areas of the specimen a few micrometers away or 
to the grounded stub a few millimeters away is likely to be 
much stronger (105 to 107&nbsp;V/m) than the field imposed by 
the E&ndash;T detector. Depending on the positive or negative 
character, this specimen field may have either a repulsive or 
an attractive effect. Thus, depending on the details of the 
local electrical field, the collection of SEs by the E&ndash;T detec-
tor may be enhanced or diminished. Negatively charging 
areas will appear bright, while in positively charging areas 
the SEs are attracted back to the specimen surface or to the 
stub so that such a region appears dark. Thus, the typical 
</p>
<p>appearance of an isolated insulating particle undergoing 
charging on a conducting surface is a bright, often saturated 
signal (possibly accompanied by amplifier overloading 
effects due to signal saturation) surrounded by a dark halo 
that extends over surrounding conducting portions of the 
specimen where the local field induced by the charging 
causes the SEs to be recollected. This type of voltage contrast 
must be regarded as an artifact, because it interferes with 
and overwhelms the regular behavior of secondary electron 
(SE) emission with local surface inclination that we depend 
upon for sensible image interpretation of specimen topogra-
phy with the E&ndash;T detector. . Figure&nbsp;9.2 shows examples of 
charging effects observed when imaging insulating particles 
on a conducting metallic substrate with the E&ndash;T (positive 
bias) detector. There are regions on the particles that are 
extremely bright due to high negative charging that increases 
the detector collection efficiency surrounded by a dark 
&ldquo;halo&rdquo; where a positive mirror charge develops, lowering the 
collection efficiency. Often these charging effects, while 
extreme in the E&ndash;T (positive bias) image due to the disrup-
tion of SE trajectories, will be negligible in a backscattered 
electron (BSE) image simultaneously collected from the 
same field of view, because the much higher energy BSEs are 
not significantly deflected by the low surface potential. An 
example is shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 9.3, where the SE image, 
. Fig.&nbsp;9.3a, shows extreme bright-dark regions due to charg-
ing while the corresponding BSE image, . Fig.&nbsp;9.3b, shows 
details of the structure of the particle. In more extreme cases 
of charging, the true topographic contrast image of the spec-
imen may be completely overwhelmed by the charging 
effects, which in the most extreme cases will actually deflect 
the beam causing image discontinuities. An example is 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 9.4, which compares images (Everhart&ndash;
Thornley detector, positive bias) of an uncoated calcite crys-
tal at E

</p>
<p>Charging phenomena are incompletely understood and 
are often found to be dynamic with time, a result of the time- 
dependent motion of the beam due to scanning action and 
due to the electrical breakdown properties of materials as 
well as differences in surface and bulk resistivity. An insulat-
ing specimen acts as a local capacitor, so that placing the 
beam at a pixel causes a charge to build up with an RC time 
constant as a function of the dwell time, followed by a decay 
of that charge when the beam moves away. Depending on the 
exact material properties, especially the surface resistivity 
which is often much lower than the bulk resistivity, and the 
</p>
<p>beam conditions (beam energy, current, and scan rate), the 
injected charge may only partially dissipate before the beam 
returns in the scan cycle, leading to strong effects in SEM 
images. Moreover, local specimen properties may cause 
charging effects to vary with position in the same image. A 
time-dependent charging situation at a pixel is shown sche-
matically in . Fig.&nbsp;9.5, where the surface potential at a par-
ticular pixel accumulates with the dwell time and then 
decays until the beam returns. In more extreme behavior, the 
accumulated charge may cause local electrical breakdown 
and abruptly discharge to ground. The time dependence of

</p>
<p>charging can result in very different imaging results as the 
pixel dwell time is changed from rapid scanning for survey-
ing a specimen to slow scanning for recording images with 
better signal-to-noise. An example of this phenomenon is 
</p>
<p>shown in . Fig.&nbsp;9.6, where an image of an uncoated mineral 
fragment taken with E
</p>
<p>0
 = 1&nbsp;keV appears to be free of charging 
</p>
<p>artifacts with a pixel dwell time of 1.6&nbsp;μs, but longer dwell 
times lead to the in-growth of a bright region due to charg-
ing. Charging artifacts can often be minimized by avoiding 
slow scanning through the use of rapid scanning and sum-
ming repeated scans to improve the signal-to-noise of the 
final image.
</p>
<p>Charging of some specimens can create contrast that can 
easily be misinterpreted as specimen features. An example is 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 9.7, where most of the polystyrene latex 
spheres (PSLs) imaged at E
</p>

<p>Thornley (positive bias) detector show true topographic 
details, but five of the PSLs have bright dots at the center, 
which might easily be mistaken for high atomic number 
inclusions or fine scale topographic features rising above the 
spherical surfaces. Raising the beam energy to 1.5&nbsp;keV and 
higher reveals  progressively more extensive and obvious evi-
dence of charging artifacts. The nature of this charging arti-
fact is revealed in . Fig.&nbsp;9.8, which compares an image of the

<p>9.1.3  Techniques to&nbsp;Control Charging 
Artifacts (High Vacuum Instruments)
</p>
<p> Observing Uncoated Specimens
</p>
<p>To understand the basic charging behavior of an uncoated 
insulator imaged with different selections of the incident 
beam energy, consider . Fig.&nbsp;9.9, which shows the behavior of 
the processes of backscattering and secondary electron emis-
sion as a function of beam energy. For beam energies above 
5&nbsp;keV, generally η + δ &lt; 1, so that more electrons are injected 
into the specimen by the beam than leave as BSEs and SEs, 
leading to an accumulation of negative charge in an insulator. 
For most materials, especially insulators, as the beam energy 
is lowered, the total emission of BSEs and SEs increases, even-
tually reaching an upper cross-over energy, E
</p>
<p>2
 (which typi-
</p>
<p>cally lies in the range 2&ndash;5&nbsp; keV depending on the material) 
where η + δ = 1, and the charge injected by the beam is just 
balanced by the charge leaving as BSEs and SEs. If a beam 
energy is selected just above E
</p>
<p>2
 where η + δ &lt; 1, the local build-
</p>
<p>up of negative charge acts to repel the subsequent incoming 
beam electrons while the beam remains at that pixel, lowering 
the effective kinetic energy with which the beam strikes the 
surface eventually reaching the E
</p>
<p>2
 energy and a dynamically 
</p>
<p>stable charge balance. For beam energies below the E
2
 value 
</p>
<p>and above the lower cross-over energy E
1
 (approximately 
</p>
<p>0.5&ndash;2&nbsp;keV, depending on the material), the emission of SE can 
actually reach very large values for insulators with δ
</p>
<p>max
 rang-
</p>
<p>ing from 2 to 20 depending on the material. Thus, in this 
beam energy region η + δ &gt; 1, resulting in positive charging 
which increases the kinetic energy of the incoming beam 
electrons until the E
</p>
<p>2
 energy is reached and charge balance 
</p>
<p>occurs. This dynamic charge stability enables uncoated insu-
lators to be imaged, as shown in the example of the uncoated 
mineral particle shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 9.10, where a charge-free 
image is obtained at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 1&nbsp; keV, but charging effects are 
</p>
<p>observed at E
0
 &ge; 2&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;Achieving effective &ldquo;dynamic charge 
</p>
<p>balance microscopy&rdquo; is sensitive to material and specimen 
shape (local tilt as it affects BSEs and particularly SE emis-
sion), and success depends on optimizing several instrument 
parameters: beam energy, beam current, and scan speed. Note 
that the uncoated mineral specimen used in the beam energy 
sequence in . Fig.&nbsp;9.10 is the same used for the pixel dwell 
time sequence at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 1&nbsp; keV in . Fig.&nbsp; 9.6 where charging is 
</p>
<p>observed when longer dwell times are used, demonstrating 
the complex response of charging to multiple variables.
</p>
<p> Coating an&nbsp;Insulating Specimen for&nbsp;Charge 
Dissipation
</p>
<p>Conductive coatings can be deposited by thermal evaporation 
with electron beam heating (metals, alloys) or with resistive 
heating (carbon), by high energy ion beam sputtering (met-
als, alloys), or by low energy plasma ion sputtering (alloys). 
The coating must cover all of the specimen, including com-
plex topographic shapes, to provide a continuous conducting 
path across the surface to dissipate the charge injected into 
the specimen by the electron beam. It is important to coat 
all surfaces that are directly exposed to the electron beam 
or which might receive charge from BSEs, possibly after re-
scattering of those BSEs. Note that applying a conductive 
coating alone may not be sufficient to achieve efficient charge 
dissipation. Many specimens may be so thick that the sides 
may not actually receive an adequate amount of the coating 
material, as illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;9.11, even with rotation dur-
ing the coating process. It is necessary to complete the path 
from the coating to the electrical ground with a conducting 
material that exhibits a low vapor pressure material that is 
compatible with the microscope&rsquo;s vacuum requirement, such 
as a metal wire, conducting tape, or metal foil.
</p>
<p>It is desirable to make the coating as thin as possible, 
and for many samples an effective conducting film can be 
2&ndash;10&nbsp;nm in thickness. A beam with E
</p>
<p>0
 &gt; 5&nbsp;keV will penetrate 
</p>
<p>through this coating and 10&ndash;100 times (or more) deeper 
depending on material and the incident beam energy, thus 
depositing most of the charge in the insulator itself. However, 
the presence of a ground plane and conducting path nanome-
ters to micrometers away from the implanted charge creates 
a very high local field gradient, &gt;106&nbsp;V/m, apparently lead-
ing to continuous breakdown and discharging. The strongest 
evidence that a continuous discharge situation is established

</p>
<p>that avoids the build-up of charge is the behavior of the 
Duane&ndash;Hunt energy limit of the X-ray continuum. As the 
beam electrons are decelerated in the Coulombic field of the 
atoms, the energy lost is emitted as photons of electromag-
netic radiation, termed bremsstrahlung, or braking radiation, 
and forming a continuous spectrum of photon energies up to 
the incident beam energy, which is the Duane&ndash;Hunt energy 
limit. Examination of the upper limit with a calibrated EDS 
detector provides proof of the highest energy with which 
beam electrons enter the specimen. When charging occurs, 
the potential that is developed serves to decelerate subsequent 
beam electrons and reduce the effective E
</p>
<p>0
 with which they 
</p>
<p>arrive, lowering the Duane&ndash;Hunt energy limit. . Figure&nbsp;9.12 
illustrates such an experiment. The true beam energy should 
first be confirmed by measuring the Duane&ndash;Hunt limit with 
a conducting high atomic number metal such as tantalum or 
gold, which produces a high continuum intensity since I

</p>

</p>
<p>scales with the atomic number. Note that because of pulse 
coincidence events, there will always be a small number of 
photons measured above the true Duane&ndash;Hunt limit. The 
true limit can be estimated with good accuracy by fitting 
the upper energy range of the continuum intensity, prefer-
ably over a region that is several kilo- electronvolts in width 
and that does not contain any characteristic X-ray peaks, 
and then finding where the curve intersects zero intensity 
to define the Duane&ndash;Hunt limit. NIST DTSA II performs 
such a fit and the result is recorded in the metadata reported 
for each spectrum processed. Once the beam energy is 
established on a conducting specimen, then the experiment 
consists of measuring a coated and uncoated insulator. In 
. Fig.&nbsp;9.12 (upper plot) spectra are shown for Si (measured 
Duane&ndash;Hunt limit = 15.11&nbsp;keV) and coated (C, 8&nbsp;nm) SiO
</p>
<p>2
 
</p>
<p>(measured Duane&ndash;Hunt limit = 15.08&nbsp;keV), which indicates 
</p>
<p>there is no significant charging in the coated SiO
2
. When an 
</p>
<p>uncoated glass slide is bombarded at E
0
 = 15&nbsp;keV, the charg-
</p>
<p>ing induced by the electron beam causes charging and thus 
severely depresses the Duane&ndash;Hunt limit to 8&nbsp;keV, as seen in 
. Fig.&nbsp;9.12 (lower plot), as well as a sharp difference in the 
shape of the X-ray continuum at higher photon energy.
</p>
<p>Choosing the&nbsp;Coating for&nbsp;Imaging Morphology
</p>
<p>The ideal coating should be continuous and featureless so 
that it does not interfere with imaging the true fine-scale fea-
tures of the specimen. Since the SE
</p>
<p>1
 signal is such an impor-
</p>
<p>tant source of high resolution information, a material that 
has a high SE coefficient should be chosen. Because the SE
</p>

</p>
<p>signal originates within a thin surface layer that is a few 
nanometers in thickness, having this layer consist of a high 
atomic number material such as gold that has a high SE

<p>coefficient will increase the relative abundance of the high 
resolution SE
</p>
<p>1
 signal, especially if the specimen consists of 
</p>
<p>much lower atomic number materials, such as biological 
material. By using the thinnest possible coating, there is only 
a vanishingly small contribution to electron backscattering 
which would tend to degrade high resolution performance.
</p>
<p>Although gold has a high SE coefficient, pure gold tends 
to form discontinuous islands whose structure can interfere 
with visualizing the desired specimen fine scale topographic 
structure. This island formation can be avoided by using 
alloys such as gold-palladium, or other pure metals, for 
example, chromium, platinum, or iridium, which can be 
deposited by plasma ion sputtering or ion beam sputtering. 
The elevated pressure in the plasma coater tends to random-
ize the paths followed by the sputtered atoms, reducing the 
directionality of the deposition and coating many re-entrant 
surfaces. For specimens which are thermally fragile, low 
deposition rates combined with specimen cooling can reduce 
the damage.
</p>
<p>9.2  Radiation Damage
</p>
<p>Certain materials are susceptible to radiation damage (&ldquo;beam 
damage&rdquo;) under energetic electron bombardment. &ldquo;Soft&rdquo; 
materials such as organic compounds are especially vulnera-
ble to radiation damage, but damage can also be observed in 
&ldquo;hard&rdquo; materials such as minerals and ceramics, especially if 
water is present in the crystal structure, as is the case for 
hydrated minerals. Radiation damage can occur at all length 
scales, from macroscopic to nanoscale. Radiation damage 
may manifest itself as material decomposition in which mass 
is actually lost as a volatile gas, or the material may change 
density, either collapsing or swelling. On an atomic scale, 
atoms may be dislodged creating vacancies or interstitial 
atoms in the host lattice.
</p>
<p>An example of radiation damage on a coarse scale is 
illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;9.13, which shows a conductive double-
sided sticky polymer tab of the type that is often used as a 
substrate for dispersing particles. This material was found 
to be extremely sensitive to electron bombardment. As the 
magnification was successively reduced in a series of 20-s 
scans, radiation damage in the form of collapse of the 
structure at the previous higher magnification scan was 
readily apparent after a single 20-s scan (20&nbsp;keV and 10&nbsp;nA). 
Note that when this tab is used as a direct support for par-
ticles, the susceptibility of the tab material to distortion due 
radiation damage can lead to unacceptable image drift. 
Instability in the position of the target particle occurs due 
to changes in the support tape immediately adjacent to the 
particle of interest where electrons strike, directly at the 
edges of the image raster and as a result of backscattering 
off the particle. Other support materials are less susceptible 
to radiation damage. . Figure&nbsp;9.14 shows a detail on a dif-
ferent conductive sticky tape material. After a much higher

<p>dose (15&nbsp; min of bombardment at 20&nbsp; keV and 10&nbsp; nA), a 
much less significant collapse crater is seen to have formed. 
It is prudent to examine the behavior of the support materi-
als under electron bombardment prior to use in a particle 
preparation.
</p>
<p>If radiation damage occurs and interferes with successful 
imaging of the structures of interest, the microscopist has 
several possible strategies:
 1. Follow a minimum dose microscopy strategy.
</p>
<p> a.  Radiation damage scales with dose. Use the lowest 
possible beam current and frame time consistent 
with establishing the visibility of the features of 
interest. It may be necessary to determine these 
parameters for establishing visibility for the particu-
lar specimen by operating initially on a portion of 
the specimen that can be sacrificed.
</p>
<p> b.  Once optimum beam current and frame time have 
been established, the SEM can be focused and stig-
mated on an area adjacent to the features of interest, 
and the stage then translated to bring the area of 
interest into position. After the image is recorded 
using the shortest possible frame time consistent 
with establishing visibility, the beam should be 
blanked (ideally into a Faraday cup) to stop further 
electron bombardment while the stored image is 
examined before proceeding.
</p>
<p> 2. Change the beam energy
  Intuitively, it would seem logical to lower the beam 
</p>
<p>energy to reduce radiation damage, and depending on 
the particular material and the exact mechanism of 
radiation damage, a lower beam energy may be useful. 
However, the energy deposited per unit volume actually 
increases significantly as the beam energy is lowered! 
From the Kanaya&ndash;Okayama range, the beam linear 
beam penetration scales approximately as E
</p>
<p>0
1.67 so that 
</p>
<p>the volume excited by the beam scales as (R

</p>
<p>5. 
The energy deposited per unit volume scales as E
</p>
<p>0
/E
</p>
<p>0
5 or 
</p>
<p>1/E
0
</p>
<p>4. Thus, the volume density of energy deposition 
increases by a factor of 104 as the beam energy decreases 
from E
</p>
<p>0
 = 10&nbsp;keV to E
</p>
<p>0
 = 1&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;Raising the beam energy 
</p>
<p>may actually be a better choice to minimize radiation 
damage.
</p>
<p> 3. Lower the specimen temperature
  Radiation damage mechanisms may be thermally sensi-
</p>
<p>tive. If a cold stage capable of achieving liquid nitrogen 
temperature or lower is available, radiation damage may 
be suppressed, especially if low temperature operation is 
combined with a minimum dose microscopy strategy.
</p>
<p>9.3  Contamination
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contamination&rdquo; broadly refers to a class of phenomena 
observed in SEM images in which a foreign material is depos-
ited on the specimen as a result of the electron beam 
</p>
<p>bombardment. Contamination is a manifestation of radia-
tion damage in which the material that undergoes radiation 
damage is unintentionally present, usually as a result of the 
original environment of the specimen or as a result of inad-
equate cleaning during preparation. Contamination typically 
arises from hydrocarbons that have been previously depos-
ited on the specimen surface, usually inadvertently. Such 
compounds are very vulnerable to radiation damage. 
Hydrocarbons may &ldquo;crack&rdquo; under electron irradiation into 
gaseous components, leaving behind a deposit of elemental 
carbon. While the beam can interact with hydrocarbons 
present in the area being scanned, electron beam induced 
migration of hydrocarbons across the surface to actually 
increase the local contamination has been observed (Hren 
1986). Sources of contamination can occur in the SEM itself. 
However, for a modern SEM that has been well maintained 
and for which scrupulous attention has been paid to degreas-
ing and subsequently cleanly handling all specimens and 
stage components, contamination from the instrument itself 
should be negligible. Ideally, an instrument should be 
equipped with a vacuum airlock to minimize the exposure of 
the specimen chamber to laboratory air and possible con-
tamination during sample exchange. A plasma cleaner that 
operates in the specimen airlock during the pump down 
cycle can greatly reduce specimen-related contamination by 
decomposing the hydrocarbons, provided the specimen itself 
is not damaged by the active oxygen plasma that is produced.
</p>
<p>A typical observation of contamination is illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp;9.15a, where the SEM was first used to image an area at 
certain magnification and the magnification was subsequently 
reduced to scan a larger area. A &ldquo;scan rectangle&rdquo; is observed in 
the lower magnification image that corresponds to the area 
previously scanned at higher magnification. Within this scan 
rectangle, the SE coefficient has changed because of the depo-
sition of a foreign material during electron bombardment, 
most likely a carbon-rich material which has a lower SE coef-
ficient. Note that the contamination is most pronounced at 
the edge of the scanned field, where the beam is briefly held 
stationary before starting the next scanned line so that the 
greatest electron dose is applied along this edge.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Etching,&rdquo; the opposite of contamination, can also occur 
(Hren 1986). An example is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;9.15b, where a 
bright scan rectangle is observed in an image of an aluminum 
stub after reducing the magnification following scanning for 
several minutes at higher magnification. In this case, the 
radiation damage has actually removed an overlayer of con-
tamination on the specimen, revealing the underlying alumi-
num with its native oxide surface layer (~4&nbsp;nm thick), which 
has an increased SE coefficient compared to the carbon-rich 
contamination layer.
</p>
<p>Contamination is usually dose-dependent, so that the high 
dose necessary for high resolution microscopy, for example, 
a small scanned area (i.e., high magnification) with a high 
current density beam from a field emission gun, is likely to 
encounter contamination effects. This situation is illustrated 
</p>

</p>
<p>in . Fig.&nbsp;9.16, which shows contamination in scanned areas 
on a patterned silicon sample used for dimensional metrol-
ogy (Postek and Vladar 2014). The  contamination in this case 
was so severe that it actually altered the apparent width of 
the measured features. To perform successful measurements, 
the authors developed an aggressive cleaning procedure that 
minimized contamination effects for this class of specimens. 
Their strategy may prove useful for other materials as well 
(Postek and Vladar 2014).
</p>
<p>9.4  Moir&eacute; Effects: Imaging What Isn&rsquo;t 
Actually There
</p>
<p>An SEM image appears to be continuous, but it is con-
structed as a regular repeating two-dimensional pattern of 
pixels. Thus, the viewer is effectively looking at the speci-
men through a two-dimensional periodic grid, and if the 
specimen itself has a structure that has a regularly repeating 
pattern, then a moir&eacute; pattern of fringes can form between

</p>
<p>the two patterns. The form of the moir&eacute; interference fringes 
depends on the spacing and orientation of the specimen 
periodic pattern and the scan pattern. Moir&eacute; patterns are 
maximized when the spatial frequencies of the two patterns 
are similar or an integer multiple of each other (i.e., they are 
commensurate). The formation of moir&eacute; patterns is illus-
trated in . Fig.&nbsp;9.17, which shows various etched patterns in 
the NIST RM 8820 magnification calibration artifact. The 
structures have different spacings in each of the fields 
viewed at the lowest magnification so that different moir&eacute; 
patterns are observed in each field. As the magnification is 
increased the scan field decreases in size so that the SEM 
pattern changes its periodicity (spatial frequency), causing 
</p>
<p>the moir&eacute; pattern to change. Finally, at sufficiently high 
magnification, the specimen periodic structure becomes 
sufficiently different from the scan pattern that the moir&eacute; 
fringes are lost.
</p>
<p>Moir&eacute; effects can be very subtle. The periodic bright flares 
at fine edges, as seen in . Fig.&nbsp;9.18, are moir&eacute; patterns created 
when the fine scale structure approaches the periodicity of 
the scan grid.
</p>
<p>To avoid interpreting moir&eacute; effects as real structures, the 
relative position and/or rotation of the specimen and the 
scan grid should be changed. A real structure will be pre-
served by such an action, while the moir&eacute; pattern will 
change.

<p>10.1  What Is &ldquo;High Resolution SEM  
Imaging&rdquo;?
</p>
<p> &ldquo;I know high resolution when I see it, but sometimes it 
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be achievable!&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;High resolution SEM imaging&rdquo; refers to the capability of 
discerning fine-scale spatial features of a specimen. Such fea-
tures may be free-standing objects or structures embedded in 
a matrix. The definition of &ldquo;fine-scale&rdquo; depends on the appli-
cation, which may involve sub-nanometer features in the 
most extreme cases. The most important factor determining 
the limit of spatial resolution is the footprint of the incident 
beam as it enters the specimen. Depending on the level of 
performance of the electron optics, the limiting beam diam-
eter can be as small as 1&nbsp;nm or even finer. However, the ulti-
mate resolution performance is likely to be substantially 
poorer than the beam footprint and will be determined by 
one or more of several additional factors: (1) delocalization 
of the imaging signal, which consists of secondary electrons 
and/or backscattered electrons, due to the physics of the 
beam electron ̶ specimen interactions; (2) constraints 
imposed on the beam size needed to satisfy the Threshold 
Equation to establish the visibility for the contrast produced 
by the features of interest; (3) mechanical stability of the 
SEM; (4) mechanical stability of the specimen mounting; (5) 
the vacuum environment and specimen cleanliness neces-
sary to avoid contamination of the specimen; (6) degradation 
of the specimen due to radiation damage; and (7) stray elec-
tromagnetic fields in the SEM environment. Recognizing 
these factors and minimizing or eliminating their impact is 
critical to achieving optimum high resolution imaging per-
formance. Because achieving satisfactory high resolution 
SEM often involves operating at the performance limit of the 
instrument as well as the technique, the experience may vary 
from one specimen type to another, with different limiting 
factors manifesting themselves in different situations. Most 
importantly, because of the limitations on feature visibility 
imposed by the Threshold Current/Contrast Equation, for a 
given choice of operating conditions, there will always be a 
level of feature contrast below which specimen features will 
not be visible. Thus, there is always a possible &ldquo;now you see it, 
now you don&rsquo;t&rdquo; experience lurking when we seek to operate 
at the limit of the SEM performance envelope.
</p>
<p>10.2  Instrumentation Considerations
</p>
<p>High resolution SEM requires that the instrument produce a 
finely focused, astigmatic beam, in the extreme 1&nbsp;nm or less 
in diameter, that carries as much current as possible to maxi-
mize contrast visibility. This challenge has been solved by 
different vendors using a variety of electron optical designs. 
The electron sources most appropriate to high resolution 
work are (1) cold field emission, which produces the high-
est brightness among possible sources (e.g., ~109 A/(cm2sr&minus;1) 
at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp; keV) but which suffers from emission current 
</p>
<p>instability with a time constant of seconds to minutes and (2) 
Schottky thermally assisted field emission, which produces 
high brightness (e.g., ~108 A/(cm2sr&minus;1) at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV) and 
</p>
<p>high stability both over the short term (seconds to minutes) 
and long term (hours to days).
</p>
<p>10.3  Pixel Size, Beam Footprint, 
and&nbsp;Delocalized Signals
</p>
<p>The fundamental step in recording an SEM image is to create 
a picture element (pixel) by placing the focused beam at a 
fixed location on the specimen and collecting the signal(s) 
generated by the beam&ndash;specimen interaction over a specific 
dwell time. The pixel is the smallest unit of information that 
is recorded in the SEM image. The linear distance between 
adjacent pixels (the pixel pitch) is the length of edge of the 
area scanned on the specimen divided by the number of pix-
els along that edge. As the magnification is increased at fixed 
pixel number, the area scanned on the specimen decreases 
and the pixel pitch decreases. Each pixel represents a unique 
sampling of specimen features and properties, provided that 
the signal(s) collected is isolated within the area represented 
by that pixel. &ldquo;Resolution&rdquo; means the capability of distin-
guishing changes in specimen properties between contigu-
ous pixels that represent a fine-scale feature against the 
adjacent background pixels or against pixels that represent 
other possibly similar nearby features. Resolution degrades 
when the signal(s) collected delocalizes out of the area repre-
sented by a pixel into the area represented by adjacent pixels 
so that the signal no longer exclusively samples the pixel of 
interest. Signal delocalization has two consequences, the loss 
of spatial specificity and the diminution of the feature con-
trast, which affects visibility. Thus, when the lateral leakage 
becomes sufficiently large, the observer will perceive blur-
ring, and less obviously the feature contrast will diminish, 
possibly falling below the threshold of visibility.
</p>
<p>How closely spaced are adjacent pixels of an image? 
. Table&nbsp;10.1 lists the distance between pixels as a function of 
the nominal magnification (relative to a 10&nbsp;x 10-cm display) 
for a 1000 x 1000&nbsp; pixel scan. For low magnifications, for 
example, less than a nominal value of 100&times;, the large scan 
fields result in pixel-to-pixel distances that are large enough 
(pixel pitch &gt;1&nbsp; μm) to contain nearly all of the possible 
information- carrying backscattered electrons (BSE) and sec-
ondary electrons (SE
</p>
<p>1
, SE
</p>
<p>2
, and SE
</p>
<p>3
) that result from the 
</p>
<p>beam electron&ndash;specimen interactions, despite the lateral 
delocalization that occurs within the interaction volume for 
the BSE (SE
</p>
<p>3
) and SE
</p>
<p>2
 signals.
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp;10.1 reveals that the footprint of a 1-nm focused 
beam will fit inside a single pixel up to a nominal magnifica-
tion of 100,000&times;. However, as discussed in the &ldquo;Electron 
Beam&ndash;Specimen Interactions&rdquo; module, the BSE and the SE

 signals, which are created by the BSE and carry the

 signals 
</p>
<p>will delocalize out of a single pixel at very low magnifications, 
approximately 40&times; for C, 200&times; for Cu, and 1000&times; for Au. Even 
allowing for the fact that the average observer viewing an SEM 
</p>
<p>image prepared with a high pixel density scan will only per-
ceive blurring when several pixels effectively overlap, these are 
surprisingly modest magnification values. Considering that 
high resolution SEM performance is routinely expected and is 
apparently delivered, this begs the question: Is such poor reso-
lution actually encountered in practice and why does it not 
prevent useful high resolution applications of the SEM?

<p>biased Everhart&ndash;Thornley (E&ndash;T) detector collects a complex 
mixture of BSE and SE signals, including a large BSE compo-
nent (Oatley 1972). The BSE component consists of a rela-
tively small contribution from the BSEs that directly strike the 
scintillator (because of its small solid angle) but this direct 
BSE component is augmented by a much larger contribution 
of indirectly collected BSEs from the relatively abundant SE
</p>
<p>2
 
</p>
<p>(produced as all BSEs exit the specimen surface) and SE
3
 (cre-
</p>
<p>ated when the BSEs strike the objective lens pole piece and 
specimen chamber walls). For an intermediate atomic num-
ber target such as copper, the SE
</p>
<p>2
 class created as the BSEs 
</p>
<p>emerge constitutes about 45 % of the total SE signal collected 
by the E&ndash;T(positive bias) detector (Peters 1984, 1985). The 
SE
</p>
<p>3
 class from BSE-to-SE conversion at the objective lens pole 
</p>
<p>piece and specimen chamber walls constitutes about 40 % of 
the total SE intensity. The SE
</p>
<p>2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
, constituting 85 % of the 
</p>
<p>total SE signal, respond to BSE number effects and create most 
of the atomic number contrast seen in the E&ndash;T(positive bias) 
image. However, the SE
</p>
<p>2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
 are subject to the same lat-
</p>
<p>eral delocalization suffered by the BSEs and result in a similar 
loss of edge resolution. Fortunately for achieving useful high 
resolution SEM, the E&ndash;T (positive bias) detector also collects 
the SE
</p>
<p>1
 component (about 15 % of the total SE signal for cop-
</p>
<p>per) which is emitted from the footprint of the incident beam. 
The SE
</p>
<p>1
 signal component thus retains high resolution spatial 
</p>
<p>information on the scale of the beam, and that information is 
superimposed on the lower resolution spatial information 
carried by the BSE, SE
</p>
<p>2
, and SE
</p>
<p>3
 signals. Careful inspection of 
</p>
<p>. Fig.&nbsp;10.1b reveals several examples of discrete fine particles 
which appear in much sharper focus than the boundaries of 
the Al-Cu eutectic phases. These particles are distinguished by 
</p>
<p>bright edges and uniform interiors and are due in part to the 
dominance of the SE
</p>
<p>1
 component that occurs at the edges of 
</p>
<p>structures but which are lost in the pure BSE image of 
. Fig.&nbsp;10.1a.

<p>10.4  Secondary Electron Contrast at High 
Spatial Resolution
</p>
<p>The secondary electron coefficient responds to changes in the 
local inclination (topography) of the specimen approximately 
following a secant function:
</p>
<p>δ θ δ θ( )= 0 sec  
(10.1)
</p>
<p>where δ
0
 is the secondary electron coefficient at normal beam 
</p>
<p>incidence, i.e., θ = 0&deg;. The contrast between two surfaces at 
different tilts can be estimated by taking the derivative of 
Eq.&nbsp;10.1:
</p>
<p>d dδ θ δ θ θ θ( )= 0 sec tan

<p>As the local tilt angle increases, the contrast between two

</p>
<p>and 10&deg;. Superimposed on this broad scale secondary elec-
tron topographic contrast are strong sources of contrast 
associated with situations where the range of SEs dominates 
leading to enhanced SE escape:
 1. When the beam strikes nearly tangentially, that is, 
</p>
<p>grazing incidence when θ approaches 90&deg; and sec θ 
reaches very high values, as the beam travels near the 
surface and a high SE signal is produced, an effect that is 
seen in the calculated contrast at high tilt angles in 
. Figs.&nbsp;10.2 and 10.3 show an example of a group of 
</p>
<p>particles imaged with an E&ndash;T(positive bias) detector. 
High SE signals occur where the beam strikes the edges 
of the particles at grazing incidence, compared to the 
interior of the particles where the incidence angle is 
more nearly normal.
</p>
<p> 2. At feature edges, especially edges that are thin compared 
to the primary electron range. These mechanisms result 
in a very noticeable &ldquo;bright edge effect.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>10.4.1  SE Range Effects Produce Bright 
Edges (Isolated Edges)
</p>
<p>Because of their extremely low kinetic energy of a few kilo- 
electronvolts, SEs have a short range of travel in a solid and 
thus can only escape from a shallow depth. The mean escape 
depth (SE range) is approximately 10&nbsp;nm for a conductor. 
When the beam is located in bulk material well away from 
edges, as shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp; 10.4, the surface 
area from which SEs can escape is effectively constant as the 
beam is scanned, and the SE emission (SE
</p>
<p>1
, SE
</p>
<p>2
, and SE
</p>
<p>2
) is 
</p>
<p>thus constant and equal to the bulk SE coefficient appropri-
ate to the target material at the local inclination angle. 
However, when the beam approaches an edge of a feature, 
such as the vertical wall shown in . Fig.&nbsp;10.4, the escape of 
SEs is enhanced by the proximity of additional surface area 
that lies within the SE escape range. As the incident beam 
travels nearly parallel to the vertical face, the proximity of 
the surface along an extended portion of the beam path fur-
ther enhances the escape of SEs, resulting in a very large

<p>excess of SEs compared to the bulk interior. In addition, 
there will be enhanced escape of BSEs near the edge, and 
these BSEs will likely strike other nearby specimen and 
instrument surfaces, producing even more SEs. All of the 
signals collected when the beam is placed at a given scan 
location are assigned to that location in the image no matter 
where on the specimen or SEM chamber those signals are 
generated. The apparent SE emission coefficient when the 
beam is placed near an edge is thus greatly increased over 
the bulk interior value, often by a factor of two to ten 
depending on the exact geometric circumstances. The edges 
of an object will appear very bright relative to the interior of 
the object, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 10.5 (e.g., objects in yellow 
circles in . Fig.&nbsp;10.5b) for particles of TiO
</p>
<p>2
. Since the edges 
</p>
<p>are often the most important factor in defining a feature, a 
contrast mechanism that produces such an enhanced edge 
</p>
<p>signal compared to bulk is a significant advantage. This is 
especially true considering the limitations that are imposed 
on high resolution performance by the demands of the 
Threshold Current/Contrast Equation, as discussed below.

Which Are Thin Relative to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Beam

<p>The enhanced SE escape near an edge shown in . Fig.&nbsp;10.4 
is further increased when the beam approaches a feature 
edge that is thin enough for penetration of the beam elec-
trons. As shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp; 10.6, not only are 
additional SEs generated as the beam electrons emerge as

<p>structure, but these energetic BSEs will continue to travel, 
backscattering off other nearby specimen surfaces and the 
SEM lens and chamber walls, producing additional genera-
tions of SEs at each surface they strike. These additional SEs 
will be collected with significant efficiency by the E&ndash;T (pos-
itive bias) detector and assigned to each pixel as the beam 
approaches the edge, further increasing the signal at a thin 
edge relative to the interior and thus increasing the contrast 
of edges.

<p>10.4.4  Too Much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Good Thing: The&nbsp;Bright 
Edge Effect Hinders Locating the True 
Position of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Edge for&nbsp;Critical 
Dimension Metrology
</p>
<p>While the enhanced SE escape at an edge is a great advan-
tage in visualizing the presence of an edge, the extreme signal 
excursion and its rapid change with beam position make it 
difficult to locate the absolute position of the edge within the 
SE range, which can span 10&nbsp;nm or even more for insulating 
materials. For advanced metrology applications such as semi-
conductor manufacturing critical dimension measurements 
where nanometer to sub-nanometer accuracy is required, 
detailed Monte Carlo modeling, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;10.8, of 
the beam electron, backscattered electron, and secondary 
electron trajectories as influenced by the specific geometry of 
the edge, is needed to deconvolve the measured signal pro-
file as a function of scan position so as to recover the best 
estimate of the true edge location and object shape (NIST 
JMONSEL: Villarrubia et&nbsp;al. 2015). An example of an SEM 
signal profile across a structure and the shape recovered after 
deconvolution through modeling is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;10.9. An 
application of this approach is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;10.10, where 
a three-dimensional photoresist line was first imaged in a 
top-down SEM view (. Fig.&nbsp;10.10a). Monte Carlo modeling 
applied to the signal profiles obtained from the top-down 
</p>
<p>view enabled a best fit estimate of the shape and dimensions 
of the line. The structure was subsequently cross-sectioned 
by ion beam milling to produce the SEM view shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 10.10b. The best estimate of the structure obtained 
from the top-down imaging and modeling (red trace) is 
shown superimposed on the direct image of the cross-section 
edges (blue trace), showing excellent correspondence with 
this approach.

<p>10.5  Achieving High Resolution 
with&nbsp;Secondary Electrons
</p>
<p>Type 1 secondary electrons (SE
1
), which are generated within 
</p>
<p>the footprint of the incident beam and from the SE escape 
depth of a few nanometers, constitute an inherently high spa-
tial resolution signal. SE
</p>
<p>1
 are capable of responding to speci-
</p>
<p>men properties with lateral dimensions equal to the beam 
size as it is made progressively finer. Unfortunately, with the 
conventional Everhart&ndash;Thornley (positive bias) detector, the 
SE
</p>
<p>1
 are difficult to distinguish from the SE
</p>
<p>2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
 signals 
</p>
<p>which are created by the emerging BSEs, which effectively 
carry BSE information, and which are thus subject to the 
same long range spatial delocalization as BSEs. Strategies to 
improve high resolution imaging with SEs seek to modify the 
spatial characteristics and/or relative abundance of the SE
</p>
<p>2
 
</p>
<p>and SE
3
 compared to the SE
</p>
<p>1
.
</p>
<p>10.5.1  Beam Energy Strategies
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;10.11a shows schematically the narrow spatial dis-
tribution of the SE
</p>
<p>1
 emitted from a finely focused beam 
</p>
<p>superimposed on the broader spatial distribution of the of 
</p>
<p>the SE
2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
 that are created from the BSE distribution 
</p>
<p>that would arise from a beam of intermediate energy, for 
example, 10&nbsp;keV, on a material of intermediate atomic num-
ber, for example, Cu. While the beam can be focused to pro-
gressively smaller sizes within the limitations of the 
electron-optical system and the SE
</p>
<p>1
 will follow the beam 
</p>
<p>footprint as it is reduced, the BSE-SE
2
-SE
</p>
<p>3
 distributions 
</p>
<p>remain at a fixed size defined by the extent of the interaction 
volume, which depends primarily on the composition and 
the beam energy and is insensitive to small beam size. For the 
situation shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 10.11a, the SE
</p>
<p>1
 distribution can 
</p>
<p>interact over a short spatial range with a feature that has 
dimensions similar to the focused beam footprint, but the 
extended BSE-SE
</p>
<p>2
-SE
</p>
<p>3
 distribution interacts with this feature 
</p>
<p>over a longer range. The BSE-SE
2
-SE
</p>
<p>3
 create a long, gradually 
</p>
<p>decreasing signal tail, so that a sharp feature appears blurred. 
There are two different strategies for improving the resolu-
tion by choosing the beam energy at the extreme limits of the 
SEM range.

 &le; 2&nbsp;keV, the situation illustrated 
</p>
<p>in . Fig.&nbsp; 10.11b is reached for a finely focused beam (Joy 
1984; Pawley 1984). The BSE-SE
</p>
<p>2

</p>
<p>3
 distributions collapse 
</p>
<p>onto the SE
1
 distribution, and all the signals now represent 
</p>
<p>high spatial resolution information. An example of carbon 
nanofibers imaged at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 1&nbsp;keV to achieve high resolution is 
</p>
<p>shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 10.12a. In . Fig.&nbsp; 10.12a, the edges of the 
wider fibers appear bright (e.g., blue arrows) relative to the 
interior, as shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;10.7a. . Figure&nbsp;10.12 
also illustrates the convergence of the bright edges of the 
narrow fibers (e.g., yellow arrows), as illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 10.12b, to produce a very bright object against the 
background.
</p>
<p>By applying a negative potential to the specimen, the 
landing energy can be reduced even further while preserving 
high spatial resolution, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 10.12b for tin 
oxide whiskers imaged with a TTL SE detector at a landing 
energy of E
</p>
<p>0
 = 0.2&nbsp;keV.
</p>
<p>There are limitations of low beam energy operation that 
must be acknowledged (Pawley 1984). An inevitable con-
sequence of low beam energy operation is the linear reduc-
tion in source brightness, which reduces the current that is 
contained in the focused probe which in turn affects feature 
visibility. Low energy beams are also more susceptible to inter-
ference from outside sources of electromagnetic radiation.
</p>
<p> High Beam Energy Strategy
</p>
<p>As the beam energy is increased, the electron range increases 
rapidly as E
</p>
<p>0
1.67, broadening the spatial distribution of the 
</p>
<p>BSE-SE

-SE
</p>
<p>3
 signals while the SE
</p>
<p>1
 distribution remains fixed 
</p>
<p>to the beam footprint. For example, when the beam energy 
is increased from 10 to 30&nbsp;keV, the range increases by a fac-
tor of 6.3. With sufficient broadening, the spatial distribu-
tions of the BSE-SE
</p>

</p>

 signals do not significantly respond 
</p>
<p>during beam scanning to small-scale features to which the

 Signal
</p>
<p>Since the SE

 Signal Is So Critical To Achieving High 
</p>
<p>Resolution, What Can Be Done To Improve It?
</p>
<p> Excluding the&nbsp;SE
3
 Component
</p>
<p>For a bulk specimen, the high resolution SE
1
 component only 
</p>
<p>forms 5&ndash;20 % of the total SE signal collected by the E&ndash;T(positive 
bias) detector, while the lower resolution SE
</p>
<p>2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
 compo-
</p>
<p>nents of roughly similar strength form the majority of the SE 
signal. While the SE
</p>
<p>1
 and SE
</p>
<p>2
 components are generated within 
</p>
<p>1 to 10&nbsp;μm, the SE
3
 are produced millimeters to centimeters 
</p>
<p>away from the specimen when the BSEs strike instrument 
components. This substantial physical separation is exploited 
by the class of &ldquo;through-the-lens&rdquo; (TTL) detectors, which uti-
lize the strong magnetic field of the objective lens to capture 
the SE
</p>
<p>1
 and SE
</p>
<p>2
 which travel up the bore of the lens and are 
</p>
<p>accelerated onto a scintillator- photomultiplier detector. 
Virtually all of the SE
</p>
<p>3
 are excluded by their points of origin 
</p>
<p>being outside of the lens magnetic field. For an SE
1
 component 
</p>
<p>of 10 % and SE
2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
 components of 45 %, the ratio of high 
</p>
<p>resolution/low resolution signals thus changes from 0.1 for the 
E&ndash;T(positive bias) detector to 0.22 for the TTL detector.
</p>
<p> Making More SE

: Apply a&nbsp;Thin High-δ Metal 
</p>
<p>Coating
</p>
<p>Because SEs are generated within a thin surface layer, the SE 
coefficient δ of the first few atomic layers will dominate the 
SE emission of the specimen. For specimens that consist of 
elements such as carbon with a low value of δ, the SE
</p>
<p>1
 signal 
</p>
<p>can be increased by applying a thin coating (one to a few 
nanometers) of a high SE emitter such as gold-palladium 
(rather than pure gold, which deposits as islands that can be 
mistaken for specimen structure), or platinum-family met-
als. While such a coating can also serve to dissipate charging 
from an insulating specimen, even for conducting carbona-
ceous materials the heavy-metal coating increases the surface

</p>
<p>1
 emission of the specimen while not significantly increas-
</p>
<p>ing the scattering of beam electrons due to its minimal thick-
ness so that BSE, SE
</p>

 and SE
</p>
<p>3
 signals are not affected. As 
</p>
<p>shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;10.14a, the SE signal across an 
uncoated particle shows an increase at the edge due to the 
grazing beam incidence, but after a thin high-δ metal coating

<p>by Eliminating Bulk Scattering 
From&nbsp;the&nbsp;Substrate
</p>
<p>For the important class of specimens such as nanoscale parti-
cles which have such small mass thickness that the beam elec-
trons penetrate through the particle into the underlying bulk 
substrate, the large BSE, SE

<p>3
 components that

<p>dominates the E&ndash;T(positive bias) signal respond to substrate 
properties and don&rsquo;t actually represent specimen information 
at all. Thus, the high resolution imaging situation can be sig-
nificantly improved by eliminating the bulk substrate. The 
particles are deposited on an ultrathin (~10-nm) carbon film 
supported on a metal (Cu, Ni, etc.) grid. This grid is placed 
over a deep blind hole drilled in a block of carbon that will 
serve as a Faraday cup for the beam electrons that pass though 
the particles, as shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp; 10.15a. An 
example of this preparation is shown for particles of SRM470

<p> Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Scanning Electron Microscope  
(STEM- in- SEM)
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;thin film&rdquo; support method for nanoscale particles and 
other thin specimens (either inherently thin or prepared as 
thin sections by ion beam milling) can be further exploited 
by collecting the beam electrons that transmit through the 
specimen to create a scanning transmission electron micro-
scope (STEM) image, as illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;10.15b. To create 
the STEM image, an appropriate detector, such as a passive 
scintillator-photomultiplier, is placed below the specimen 
grid on the optical axis. The size of this detector is such that 
it accepts only electrons traveling close to the optical axis that 
pass through the specimen unscattered. Those electrons that 
experience even a small angle elastic scattering event that 
causes an angular deviation of a few degrees will miss the 
detector. Thus, the regions of the specimen with minimal 
scattering will appear bright, while those with sufficient mass 
to cause elastic scattering will appear dark, creating a &ldquo;bright- 
field&rdquo; image. A more elaborate STEM detector array can 
include an annular ring detector co-mounted with the cen-
tral on-axis bright-field detector to capture the elastically 
scattered transmitted electrons from the specimen, as illus-
trated in . Fig.&nbsp; 10.15b. This off-axis annular detector pro-
duces a &ldquo;dark-field&rdquo; image since the thin regions such as the 
support film that do not produce significant scattering events 
</p>
<p>will appear dark. Portions of the specimen that do scatter suf-
ficiently will appear bright. Since elastic scattering depends 
strongly on local atomic number, compositional effects can 
be observed in the dark field STEM image. An example of a 
high resolution STEM-in-SEM image created with an annu-
lar off-axis detector is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;10.17.

<p>A simple STEM-in-SEM bright-field detector can be 
created as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;10.18. The grid carrying the thin 
specimen is placed over an aperture that serves to stop elec-
trons that have suffered an elastic scattering event in the 
specimen. The unscattered beam electrons pass through this 
aperture and strike a gold-covered surface below, where they 
generate strong SE emission, which is then attracted to the 
E&ndash;T(positive bias) detector, creating a bright-field image. If 
the SEM is also equipped with a TTL detector, the nearly pure

<p>energy, for example, E

 &ge; 10&nbsp; keV.&nbsp; However, high resolution 
</p>
<p>SEM can be achieved by eliminating the use of SEs as the 
imaging signal and instead relying on the BSEs, specifically 
those that have lost very little of the initial beam energy. 
Because of the energy loss due to inelastic scattering that 
occurs for high energy beam electrons at a nearly constant 
rate, dE/ds, with distance traveled in the specimen, low loss 
BSEs represent beam electrons that have emerged from the 
specimen after traveling very short paths through the 
 specimen. These low loss electrons are thus sensitive to spec-
imen scattering properties very close to the entrance beam 
footprint and from a very shallow surface region, thus consti-
tuting a high resolution signal. Wells (1974a, b) first demon-
strated the utility of this approach by using an energy filter to 
select the &ldquo;low loss&rdquo; backscattered electrons (LL BSE) that 
had lost less than a specified fraction, for example, 5 %, of the 
initial beam energy. At normal beam incidence, the LL BSE 
fraction of the total BSE population is very low, and their tra-
jectories are spread over a wide angular range, the 2π azi-
muth around the beam, making their efficient collection 
difficult. The population of LL BSE can be increased, and 
their angular spread greatly decreased, by tilting the speci-
men to a high angle, for example, 70&deg; or higher. As shown 
schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;10.20, at this tilt angle a single elastic 
</p>
<p>scattering event greater than 20&deg;, which also has a suitable 
azimuthal angular component along the trajectory, can carry 
the beam electron out of the specimen as a low loss BSE after 
traveling along a short path within the specimen. The energy 
filter with an applied potential V + ΔV then serves to deceler-
ate and exclude BSEs that have lost more than a specified ΔE 
of the incident energy. Since the electrons that pass through 
the filter have been retarded to a low kinetic energy, the 
detector following the filter must include an acceleration 
field, such as that of the Everhart&ndash;Thornley detector, to raise 
the kinetic energy to a detectable level for detection.
</p>
<p>An example comparing TTL SE and LL BSE (10 % energy 
window) images of etched photoresist at low beam energy

pattern in the LL BSE image compared to the SE image. The

</p>
<p>While the example in . Fig.&nbsp;10.21 illustrates the utility of 
LL BSE imaging at low beam energy, LL BSE imaging also 
enables operation of the SEM at high beam energy (Wells 
1971), thus maximizing the electron gun brightness to enable 
a small beam with maximum current. Low loss images pro-
vide both high lateral spatial resolution and a shallow sam-
pling depth.
</p>
<p>10.6  Factors That Hinder Achieving High 
Resolution
</p>
<p>10.6.1  Achieving Visibility: The&nbsp;Threshold 
Contrast
</p>
<p>High resolution SEM involves working with a finely focused 
beam which even when optimized to minimize the effects 
of aberrations inevitably carries a small current, often as 
low as a few picoamperes, because of the restrictions 
imposed by the Brightness Equation. The inevitable conse-
quence of operating with low beam current is the problem 
of establishing the visibility of the features of interest 
because of the restrictions imposed by the Threshold 
Equation. For a given selection of operating parameters, 
including beam current, detector solid angle, signal conver-
sion efficiency, and pixel dwell time, there is always a 
threshold of detectable contrast. Features producing con-
trast below this threshold contrast will not be visible at the 
pixel density selected for the scan, even with post-process-
ing of the image with various advanced image manipulation 
algorithms. It is important to understand that a major con-
sequence of the Threshold Equation is that the absence of a 
feature in an SEM image is not a guarantee of the absence of 
that feature on the specimen: the feature may not be pro-
ducing sufficient contrast to exceed the threshold contrast 
for the particular operating conditions chosen. Because of 
the action of the &ldquo;bright edge effect&rdquo; in high resolution SE 
images to produce very high contrast, approaching unity, 
between the edges of a feature and its interior, the ready vis-
ibility of the edges of features, while obviously useful and 
important, can give a false sense of security with regard to 
the absence of topographic details within the bulk of a fea-
ture. In fact, those weaker topographic features may be pro-
ducing contrast that is below the threshold of visibility. To 
perform &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; and explore the possibility of fea-
tures lurking below the threshold of visibility, the threshold 
contrast must be lowered:

<p>F
 is the 
</p>
<p>frame time. Equation&nbsp;10.4 reveals the constraints the micros-
copist faces: if the beam current is determined by the require-
ment to maintain a certain beam size and the detector has 
been optimized for the signal(s) that the features of interest 
are likely to produce, then the only factor remaining to 
manipulate to lower the threshold contrast is to extend the 
dwell time per pixel (t
</p>
<p>F

</p>
<p>PE
). While using longer pixel dwell 
</p>
<p>times is certainly an important strategy that should be 
exploited, other factors may limit its utility, including speci-
men drift, contamination, and damage due to increased dose. 
Thus, performing high resolution SEM almost always a 
dynamic tension when establishing the visibility of low con-
trast features between the electron dose needed to exceed the 
threshold of visibility and the consequences of that electron 
dose to the specimen.
</p>
<p>10.6.2  Pathological Specimen Behavior
</p>
<p>The electron dose needed for high resolution SEM even with 
an optimized instrument can exceed the radiation damage 
threshold for certain materials, especially &ldquo;soft&rdquo; materials 
such as biological materials and other weakly bonded organic 
and inorganic substances. Damage may be readily apparent 
in repeated scans, especially when the magnification is low-
ered after recording an image. If such specimen damage is 
severe, a &ldquo;minimum-dose&rdquo; strategy may be necessary, includ-
ing such procedures as focusing and optimizing the image on 
a nearby area, blanking the beam, translating the specimen to 
an unexposed area, and then exposing the specimen for a 
single imaging frame.
</p>
<p>Another possibility is to explore the sensitivity of the 
specimen to damage over a wide range of beam energy. It 
may seem likely that operating at low beam energy should 
minimize specimen damage, but this may not be the case. 
Because the electron range scales as E
</p>
<p>0
1.67 and the volume as 
</p>
<p>(E
0
</p>
<p>1.67)3 while the energy deposited scales as E
0
, the energy 
</p>
<p>deposited per unit volume scales roughly as
</p>
<p>Energy unit volume/ / /.= ( ) =E E E0 01 67
3
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>41
 
</p>
<p>(10.5)
</p>
<p>Thus, increasing the beam energy from 1 to 10&nbsp;keV lowers 
the energy deposited per unit volume by a factor of approxi-
mately 10,000. This simplistic argument obviously ignores 
the substantial variation in the energy density within the 
interaction volume as well as the possibility that some dam-
age mechanisms have an energy threshold for activation that 
may be avoided by lowering the beam energy. Nevertheless, 
Eq.&nbsp;10.5 suggests that examining the material susceptibility to 
damage over a wide range of beam energy may be a useful 
strategy.

<p>10.6.3  Pathological Specimen and 
Instrumentation Behavior
</p>
<p> Contamination
</p>
<p>A modern SEM that is well maintained should not be the 
source of any contamination that is observed. The first 
requirement of avoiding contamination is a specimen prepa-
ration protocol that minimizes the incorporation of or reten-
tion of contaminating compounds when processing the 
specimen. This caution includes the specimen as well as the 
mounting materials such as sticky conductive tape. A speci-
men airlock that minimizes the volume brought to atmo-
sphere for specimen exchange as well as providing the 
important capability of pre-pumping the specimen to remove 
volatile compounds prior to insertion in the specimen cham-
ber is an important capability for high resolution SEM.&nbsp;The 
specimen airlock can also be equipped with a &ldquo;plasma 
cleaner&rdquo; that generates a low energy oxygen ion stream for 
destruction and removal of organic compounds that produce 
contamination. If contamination is still observed after a care-
ful preparation and insertion protocol has been followed, it is 
much more likely that the source of contamination remains 
the specimen itself and not the SEM vacuum system.
</p>
<p> Instabilities
</p>
<p>Unstable imaging conditions can arise from several sources. 
(1) Drift and vibration: The specimen preparation, the 
method of attachment to the substrate, the attachment of the 
specimen mount to the stage, and the stage itself must all 
have high stability to avoid drift, which is most noticeable at 
high magnification, and isolation from sources of vibration. 
Note that some mounting materials such as sticky tape may 
be subject to beam damage and distortion when struck by the 
beam electrons, leading to significant drift. One of the most 
stable mechanical stage designs is to be mounted within the 
bore of the objective lens, although such designs severely 
limit the size of the specimen and the extent of lateral motion 
that can be achieved. (2) Electromagnetic radiation interfer-
ence: A periodic distortion is sometimes observed that is a 
result of interference from various sources of electromag-
netic radiation, including emissions from 60-Hz AC sources, 
including emissions from fluorescent lighting fixtures. Rather 
than being random, this type of interference can synchronize 
with the scan and can be recorded. An example of this type of 
image defect is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;10.22. Eliminating this type of 
interference and the resulting image defects can be extremely 
challenging.

<p>The incident beam energy is one of the most useful parame-
ters over which the microscopist has control because it deter-
mines the lateral and depth sampling of the specimen 
properties by the critical imaging signals. The Kanaya&ndash;
Okayama electron range varies strongly with the incident 
beam energy:

</p>
<p>where A is the atomic weight (g/mol), Z is the atomic num-
ber, ρ is the density (g/cm3), and E
</p>
<p>0
 (keV) is the incident 
</p>
<p>beam energy, which is shown graphically in . Fig.&nbsp;11.1a&ndash;c.
</p>
<p>11.1  What Constitutes &ldquo;Low&rdquo; Beam Energy 
SEM Imaging?
</p>
<p>The rapid but continuous decrease of the range with E
0
 shown 
</p>
<p>in . Fig.&nbsp;11.1a raises the question, Where does &ldquo;low&rdquo; beam 
energy SEM imaging begin? That is, what value of E
</p>
<p>0
 consti-
</p>
<p>tutes the upper bound of &ldquo;low&rdquo; beam energy microscopy? As 
</p>
<p>will be discussed below, useful SEM imaging can now be 
accomplished down to remarkably low arrival energies at the 
specimen surface, less than 100&nbsp;eV.&nbsp;The upper bound for E
</p>
<p>0
 is 
</p>
<p>arbitrary, but a reasonable limit is the value discussed in the 
&ldquo;Low Beam Energy X-Ray Microanalysis&rdquo; module, where it is 
found that E
</p>
<p>0
 = 5&nbsp;keV is the lowest beam energy for which a 
</p>
<p>useful characteristic X-ray peak can be excited for all ele-
ments of the periodic table, excepting H and He, which do 
not produce characteristic X-rays. Thus, the plot of the range 
for E
</p>
<p>0
 &le; 5&nbsp;keV shown in . Fig.&nbsp;11.1b will be taken to define 
</p>
<p>the range for low beam energy SEM.

<p>(2) Although the SE
1
 are sensitive to surface characteristics 
</p>
<p>within the escape depth of ~ 10&nbsp; nm (metals), this surface 
sensitivity is diluted by the more numerous SE
</p>
<p>2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
, 
</p>
<p>which compose about 75&ndash;85 % of the total SE signal. SE
2
 and 
</p>
<p>SE
3
 carry BSE information since they are created by the exit-
</p>
<p>ing BSEs at the specimen surface and on the chamber walls. 
Because the BSEs escape from approximately 15 % (high Z) 
to 30 % (low Z) of R
</p>
<p>K&ndash;O
, BSE depth sensitivity in turn deter-
</p>
<p>mines the effective sampling of sub-surface information car-
ried by the SE
</p>
<p>2
 and the SE
</p>
<p>3
, which is one to two orders of 
</p>
<p>magnitude greater than the ~10&nbsp;nm of the SE
1
.
</p>
<p>As E
0
 is reduced into the low beam energy range below 
</p>
<p>5&nbsp; keV, the rapid reduction in the electron range given by 
equation 11.1, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;11.1 b, strongly influences 
the secondary electron coefficient: (1) The fraction of the 
incident energy lost by the beam electrons near the surface 
increases, which in turn increases the production of SEs, so 
that δ increases as the beam energy is reduced, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 11.2 for several elements for measurements con-
ducted in one laboratory. Because of this significant increase 
in SE production in the low beam energy range, generally 
δ &gt; η, as shown for Au in . Fig.&nbsp; 11.3. In low beam energy 
SEM, backscattering still occurs, but due to their much 
greater abundance SEs generally dominate the signal col-
lected by the Everhart&ndash;Thornley (E-T)(positive bias) detec-
tor. (2) As the beam energy decreases, the collapse of the 
lateral and depth ranges increases the fraction of the SE
</p>
<p>2
 
</p>
<p>and SE
3
 that carry surface information equivalent to the 
</p>
<p>SE
1
. This trend makes the SE image increasingly sensitive to 
</p>
<p>the surface characteristics of the material as the beam 
energy is reduced. However, the surface of a material is 
often unexpectedly complex. Upon exposure to the atmo-
sphere, most &ldquo;pure&rdquo; elements form a thin surface oxide 
layer, for example, approximately 4&nbsp;nm of Al
</p>
<p>2
O
</p>
<p>3
 forms on 
</p>
<p>Al. Moreover, this surface layer may incorporate water 
chemically to form hydroxide and/or carbon dioxide to 
form carbonate, or there may be physical adsorption of 
these and other compounds from the environment which 
may not evaporate under vacuum. Additionally, there may 
be unexpected contamination from hydrocarbons depos-
ited on the specimen surface which generally arise from the 
environment to which the specimen was exposed prior to 
the SEM.&nbsp;In some cases such contamination may be depos-
ited from the SEM vacuum system if sufficient care has not 
been previously taken to eliminate sources of volatile con-
tamination by rigorous specimen cleaning and by pre- 
pumping in an airlock prior to transferring into the 
specimen chamber. Complex surface composition is the 
likely reason for the wide range of δ values reported by 
various researchers measuring a nominally common target, 
as illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;11.4 for aluminum, where reported 
values of δ span a factor of 4 or more. This is a common 
result across the periodic table, as seen in the SE database 
compiled by Joy (2012). The strong surface sensitivity of the 
SE and BSE signals at low beam energy to the condition of 
the specimen surface means that SEM image interpretation 
of &ldquo;real&rdquo; as-received specimens will be challenging. In situ 
cleaning by ion beam milling in a &ldquo;dual beam&rdquo; platform may

the&nbsp;Spatial Sampling of&nbsp;Imaging 
Signals
</p>
<p>11.3.1  Low Beam Energy for&nbsp;High Lateral 
Resolution SEM
</p>
<p>The electron range controls the lateral spatial distribution 
of the backscattered electrons: 90 % of BSEs escape radially 
from approximately 30 % R
</p>
<p>K-O
 (high Z) to 60 % R
</p>
<p>K-O
 (low 
</p>
<p>Z). The lateral spatial distribution of the SE
2
, which is cre-
</p>
<p>ated as the BSE escape through the surface, and the SE
3
, 
</p>
<p>which is the BSE-to-SE conversion signal that results when 
BSE strike the objective lens pole piece, the stage compo-
nents, and the chamber walls, effectively sample the same 
spatial range as the BSE.&nbsp; As the incident beam energy is 
lowered, the BSE (SE
</p>
<p>3
) and SE
</p>
<p>2
 signal lateral distributions 
</p>
<p>collapse onto the SE
1
 distribution, which is restricted to 
</p>
<p>the beam footprint, so that at sufficiently low beam energy 
all of these signals carry high spatial resolution informa-
tion similar to the SE
</p>
<p>1
. With a modern high performance 
</p>
<p>SEM equipped with a high brightness source, for example, 
a cold field emission gun or a Schottky thermally assisted 
field emission gun, capable of delivering a useful beam 
current into a nanometer or sub- nanometer diameter 
beam, low beam energy SEM operation has become the 
</p>
<p>most frequent choice to achieve high lateral spatial resolu-

the &ldquo;High Resolution SEM&rdquo; module. An example of high

Unfortunately, there is no simple rule like η vs. Z at high 
beam energy for interpreting the contrast seen in this 
image. For example, why does the population of nanoscale 
particles appear extremely bright against the general mid-
level gray of the bulk background of the silver structure. 
These features may appear bright because of local compo-
sitional differences such as thicker oxides or there may be a 
physical change such as increased surface area for SE emis-
sion due to nanoscale roughening.

<p>11.3.2  Low Beam Energy for&nbsp;High Depth 
Resolution SEM
</p>
<p>The strong exponential dependence of the beam penetration 
on the incident energy controls the sampling of sub-surface 
specimen properties by the BSEs and SEs, which can provide 
insight on the depth dimension. Observing a specimen as the 
beam energy is progressively lowered to record systematic 
changes can reveal lateral heterogeneities in surface compo-
sition. . Fig.&nbsp;11.6 shows such a sequence of images from high 
beam energy (30&nbsp;keV) to low beam energy (1&nbsp;keV) prepared 
with an E&ndash;T(positive bias) detector where the specimen is an 
aluminum stub upon which was deposited approximately

between the carbon and the aluminum behaves in a complex 
fashion. The C-Al contrast is only weakly visible above

<p>tion, and post-acquisition image processing for contrast 
enhancement. The C-Al contrast increases sharply as the 
beam energy decreases below 5&nbsp;keV, reaching a maximum at 
E
</p>
<p>0

</p>
<p>increase in contrast below 5&nbsp; keV is consistent with the 
increasing separation between the values of δ for C and Al 
seen in . Fig.&nbsp;11.2. The eventual decrease in the C-Al contrast 
below E
</p>
<p>0

</p>
<p>plotted in . Fig.&nbsp;11.2, where the difference between δ for C 
and Al actually increases below E
</p>
<p>0
 = 2&nbsp; keV, which should 
</p>
<p>increase the contrast. Despite the difficulty in interpreting 
these trends in contrast, this example demonstrates that lat-
eral differences in the surface can be detected, provided care 
is taken to fully explore the image response to changing the 
beam energy parameter.

<p>11.3.3  Extremely Low Beam Energy Imaging
</p>
<p>High performance SEMs typically operate down to beam 
energies below 0.5&nbsp; keV, with the lower limit depending on 
the vendor and the particular model. Ultralow beam energies 
below 0.1&nbsp; keV can be achieved through different electron- 
optical techniques, including biasing the specimen to 
&ndash;V.&nbsp;Specimen biasing acts to decelerate the beam electrons 
emitted at energy E

 from the column so that the landing 
</p>
<p>energy, that is, the kinetic energy remaining when the beam 
electrons reach the specimen surface, is E
</p>
<p>0
 &ndash;eV, where e rep-
</p>
<p>resents the electronic charge. Ultralow beam energy imaging 
is illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;11.7, where the surface of a silica (SiO

) 
</p>
<p>specimen is imaged at a landing energy of 0.030&nbsp;keV (30&nbsp;eV). 
. Figure&nbsp; 11.8 shows gold islands on carbon imaged with a 
landing energy of 0.01&nbsp; keV (10&nbsp; eV). At such low incident 
energy, only the outermost atomic/molecular layers are 
probed by the beam.

<p>12.1  Review: The&nbsp;Conventional SEM High 
Vacuum Environment
</p>
<p>The conventional SEM must operate with a pressure in the 
sample chamber below ~10&minus;4 Pa (~10&minus;6 torr), a condition 
determined by the need to satisfy four key instrumental 
operating conditions:
</p>
<p>12.1.1  Stable Electron Source Operation
</p>
<p>The pressure in the electron gun must be maintained below 
10&minus;4 Pa (~10&minus;6 torr) for stable operation of a conventional 
thermal emission tungsten filament and below 10&minus;7 Pa (~10&minus;9 
torr) for a thermally assisted field emission source. Although 
a separate pumping system is typically devoted to the elec-
tron source to maintain the proper vacuum, if the specimen 
chamber pressure in a conventional SEM is allowed to rise, 
gas molecules will diffuse to the gun, raising the pressure and 
causing unstable operation and early failure.
</p>
<p>12.1.2  Maintaining Beam Integrity
</p>
<p>An electron emitted from the source that encounters a gas 
atom along the path to the specimen will scatter elastically, 
changing the trajectory and causing the electron to deviate 
out of the focused beam. To preserve the integrity of the 
beam, the column and chamber pressure must be reduced to 
the point that the number of collisions between the beam 
electrons and the residual gas molecules is negligible along 
the entire path, which typically extends to 25&nbsp;cm or more.
</p>
<p>12.1.3  Stable Operation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Everhart&ndash;
Thornley Secondary Electron 
Detector
</p>
<p>To serve as a detector for secondary electrons, the Everhart&ndash;
Thornley secondary electron detector must be operated with 
a bias of +10,000 volts or more applied to the face of the scin-
tillator to accelerate the SE and raise their kinetic energy suf-
ficiently to cause light emission. If the chamber pressure 
exceeds approximately 100&nbsp;mPa (~10&minus;3 torr), electrical dis-
charge events will begin to occur due to gas ionization 
between the scintillator (+10,000&nbsp; V) and the Faraday cage 
(+250&nbsp; V), which is located in close proximity, initially 
increasing the noise and thus degrading the signal-to-noise 
ratio. As the chamber pressure is further increased, electrical 
arcing will eventually cause total operational failure.
</p>
<p>12.1.4  Minimizing Contamination
</p>
<p>A major source of specimen contamination during examina-
tion arises from the cracking of hydrocarbons by the electron 
</p>
<p>beam. A critical factor in determining contamination rates is 
the availability of hydrocarbon molecules for the beam elec-
trons to hit. To achieve a low contamination environment, 
the pumping system must be capable of achieving low ulti-
mate operating pressures. A specimen exchange airlock can 
pump off most volatiles, minimizing the exposure of the 
specimen chamber, and the airlock can be augmented with a 
plasma cleaning system to actively destroy volatiles. Finally, 
the vacuum system can be augmented with careful cold sur-
face trapping of any remaining volatiles from the specimen 
or those that can backstream from the pump so as to mini-
mize the partial pressure of hydrocarbons. Most importantly, 
to avoid introducing unnecessary sources of contamination, 
the microscopist must be very careful in handling instru-
ment parts and specimens to avoid inadvertently depositing 
highly volatile hydrocarbons, such as those associated with 
skin oils deposited in fingerprints, into the conventional 
SEM.&nbsp;With this level of operational care when operating in a 
well maintained modern instrument, beam-induced con-
tamination when observed almost always results from resid-
ual hydrocarbons on the specimen which remain from 
incomplete cleaning rather than from hydrocarbons from 
the vacuum system itself.
</p>
<p>A significant price is paid to operate the SEM with such 
a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; high vacuum. The specimen must be prepared in a 
condition so as not to evolve gases in the vacuum environ-
ment. Many important materials, such as biological tissues, 
contain liquid water, which will rapidly evaporate at 
reduced pressure, distorting the microscopic details of a 
specimen and disturbing the stable operating conditions of 
the microscope. This water, and any other volatile sub-
stances, must be removed during sample preparation to 
examine the specimen in a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; state, or the water must be 
immobilized by freezing to low temperatures (&ldquo;frozen, 
hydrated samples&rdquo;). Such specimen preparation is both 
time-consuming and prone to introducing artifacts, includ-
ing the redistribution of &ldquo;diffusible&rdquo; elements, such as the 
alkali ions of salts.
</p>
<p>12.2  How Does VPSEM Differ 
From&nbsp;the&nbsp;Conventional SEM Vacuum 
Environment?
</p>
<p>The development of the variable pressure scanning  electron 
microscope (VPSEM) has enabled operation with&nbsp;elevated 
specimen chamber pressures in the range ~1&ndash;2500&nbsp; Pa 
(~0.01&ndash;20&nbsp;torr) while still maintaining a high level of SEM 
imaging performance (Danilatos 1988, 1991). The VPSEM 
utilizes &ldquo;differential pumping&rdquo; with several stages to obtain 
the desired elevated pressure in the specimen chamber 
while simultaneously maintaining a satisfactory pressure 
for stable operation of the electron gun and protection of 
the beam electrons from encountering elevated gas pres-
sure along most of the flight path down the column. 
Differential pumping consists of establishing a series of 
</p>
<p> Chapter 12 &middot; Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscopy (VPSEM)</p>
<p/>

<p>175 12
</p>
<p>regions of successively lower pressure, with each region 
separated by small apertures from the regions on either 
side and each region having its own dedicated pumping 
path. The probability of gas  molecules moving from one 
region to the next is limited by the area of the aperture. In 
the VPSEM, these differential pumping apertures also 
serve as the beam-defining apertures. A typical vacuum 
design consists of separate pumping systems for the speci-
men chamber, one region for each lens, and finally the 
electron gun. Such a vacuum system can maintain a pres-
sure differential of six orders of magnitude or more 
between the specimen chamber and the electron gun, 
enabling use of both conventional thermionic sources and 
thermally-assisted field emission sources. A wide variety of 
gases can be used in the elevated pressure sample chamber, 
including oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and water vapor. 
Because the imaging conditions are extremely sensitive to 
the sample chamber pressure, careful regulation of the 
pressure and of its stability for extended periods is required.
</p>
<p>12.3  Benefits of&nbsp;Scanning Electron 
Microscopy at Elevated Pressures
</p>
<p>There are several special benefits to performing scanning 
electron microscopy at elevated pressures.
</p>
<p>12.3.1  Control of&nbsp;Specimen Charging
</p>
<p>Insulating materials suffer charging in the conventional high 
vacuum SEM because the high resistivity of the specimen 
prevents the migration of the charges injected by the beam, 
as partially offset by charges that leave the specimen as back-
scattered and secondary electrons, to reach an electrical 
ground. Consequently, there develops a local accumulation 
of charge. Depending on the beam energy, the material prop-
erties, and the local inclination of the specimen to the beam, 
negative or positive charging can occur. Charging phenom-
ena can be manifest in many ways in SEM images, ranging at 
the threshold from diminished collection of secondary elec-
trons which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio to more extreme 
effects where the local charge accumulation is high enough to 
cause actual displacement of the position of the beam, often 
seen as discontinuities in the scanned image. In the most 
extreme cases, the charge may be sufficient for the specimen 
to act as a mirror and deflect the beam entirely. In conven-
tional SEM operation, charging is typically eliminated or at 
least minimized by applying a thin conducting coating to an 
insulating specimen and connecting the coating layer to elec-
trical ground.
</p>
<p>In the VPSEM, incident beam electrons, BSE and SE 
can scatter inelastically with gas atoms near the specimen, 
ionizing those gas atoms to create free low kinetic energy 
electrons and positive ions. Areas of an insulating 
 specimen that charge will attract the appropriate oppo-
</p>
<p>sitely charged species from this charge cloud, the positively 
ionized gas atoms or the free electrons, leading to local 
dynamic charge neutralization, enabling insulating mate-
rials to be examined without a coating. Moreover, the 
environmental gas, the ionized gas atoms, and the free 
electrons can penetrate into complex geometric features 
such as deep holes, features which would be very difficult 
to coat to establish a conducting path for conventional 
high vacuum SEM.&nbsp; An example of VPSEM imaging of a 
very complex insulating object is shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 12.1, 
which is an array of glass microcapillaries examined with-
out any coating. No charging is observed in this secondary 
electron VPSEM image with E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV (prepared with a 
</p>
<p>gaseous secondary electron detector, as described below) 
despite the very deep recesses in the structure. Another 
example is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;12.2a, which shows a compari-
son of images of a complex polymer foam imaged in high 
vacuum SEM at a low beam energy of E
</p>
<p>0

</p>

ment of charging, and in VPSEM mode with E
</p>
<p>0

</p>
<p>and an off-axis backscattered electron (BSE) detector, 
showing no charging effects. A challenging insulating 
sample with a complex surface is shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 12.2b, 
which depicts fresh popcorn imaged under VPSEM condi-
tions with a BSE detector.
</p>
<p>Achieving suppression of charging for such complex 
insulating objects as those shown in . Figs.&nbsp; 12.1 and 12.2 
involves careful control of the usual parameters of beam 
energy, beam current, and specimen tilt. In VPSEM opera-
tion the additional critical variables of environmental gas 
species and partial pressure must be carefully explored. 
Additionally, the special detectors for SE that have been 
developed for VPSEM operation can also play a role in charge 
suppression.

<p>12.3.2  Controlling the&nbsp;Water Environment 
of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Specimen
</p>
<p>Careful control and preservation of the water content of a 
specimen can be critical to recording SEM images that are 
free from artifacts or suffer only minimal artifacts. 
Additionally, when there is control of the partial pressure of 
water vapor in the specimen chamber to maintain liquid 
water in equilibrium with the gas phase, it becomes possible 
to observe chemical reactions that are mediated by water.
</p>
<p>By monitoring and controlling the relative humidity, it 
is possible to add water by condensation or remove it by 
evaporation. . Figure&nbsp; 12.3 shows the pressure&ndash;tempera-
ture phase diagram for water. The pressure&ndash;temperature 
conditions to maintain liquid water, ice, and water vapor in 
equilibrium can be achieved at the upper end of the oper-
ating pressure range of certain VPSEMs when augmented

<p>with a cooling stage capable of reaching &minus;5&nbsp;&deg;C to 5&nbsp;&deg;C.&nbsp;With 
careful control of both the pressure of water vapor added 
to the specimen chamber and of the specimen tempera-
ture, the microscopist can select the relative humidity in 
the sample chamber so that water can be  evaporated, con-
densed, or maintained in liquid&ndash;gas or solid-gas equilib-
rium. In addition to direct examination of water-containing 
specimens, experiments can be  performed in which the 
presence and quantity amount of water is controlled as a 
variable, enabling a wide range of chemical reactions to be 
observed. . Figure&nbsp;12.4 shows an example of the condensa-
tion of water on a silicon wafer, one side of which was cov-
ered with a hydrophobic layer while the other was coated 
with a hydrophilic layer, directly revealing the differences 
in the wetting behavior on the two applied layers, as well as 
the bare silicon exposed by fracturing the specimen.

<p>The differential pumping system achieves vacuum levels that 
minimize gas scattering and preserve the beam integrity as it 
passes from the electron source through the electron-optical 
column. As the beam emerges from the high vacuum of the 
electron column through the final aperture into the elevated 
pressure of the specimen chamber, the volume density of gas 
atoms rapidly increases, and with it the probability that elas-
tic scattering events with the gas atoms will occur. Although 
the volume density of the gas atoms in the chamber is very 
low compared to the density of a solid material, the path 
length that the beam electrons must travel in the elevated 
pressure region of the sample chamber typically ranges from 
</p>
<p>1&nbsp;mm to 10&nbsp;mm or more before reaching the specimen sur-
face. As illustrated schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;12.5, elastic scatter-
ing events that occur with the gas molecules along this path 
cause beam electrons to substantially deviate out of the 
focused beam to create a &ldquo;skirt&rdquo;. Even a small angle elastic 
event with a 1-degree scattering angle that occurs 1&nbsp; mm 
above the specimen surface will cause the beam electron to 
be displaced by 17&nbsp;μm radially from the focused beam.
</p>
<p>How large is the gas-scattering skirt? The extent of the 
beam skirt can be estimated from the ideal gas law (the density 
of particles at a pressure p is given by n/V = p/RT, where n is 
the number of moles, V is the volume, R is the gas constant, 
and T is the temperature) and by using the cross section for 
elastic scattering for a single event (Danilatos 1988):

</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp; 12.6 plots the skirt radius for a beam energy of 
20&nbsp;keV as a function of the gas path length through oxygen at 
several different chamber pressures. For a pressure of 100&nbsp;Pa 
and a gas path length of 5&nbsp;mm, the skirt radius is calculated 
to be 30&nbsp;μm. Consider the change in scale from the focused 
beam to the skirt that results from gas scattering. The high 
vacuum beam footprint that gives the lateral extent of the 
BSE, SE, and X-ray production can be estimated with the

<p>good estimate of the diameter of the interaction volume pro-
jected on the entrance surface. With a beam/interaction vol-
ume footprint radius of 0.75&nbsp;μm, the gas scattering skirt of 
30-μm radius is thus a factor of 40 larger in linear dimension, 
and the skirt is a factor of 1600 larger in area than that due 
the focused beam and beam specimen interactions. 
Considering just a 10-nm incident beam diameter (5-nm 
radius), the gas scattering skirt is 6000 times larger.
</p>
<p>While Eq.&nbsp;12.1 is useful to estimate the extent of the gas 
scattering skirt under VPSEM conditions, it provides no 
 information on the relative fraction of the beam that remains 
unscattered or on the distribution of gas-scattered electrons 
within the skirt. The Monte Carlo simulation embedded in 
NIST DTSA-II enables explicit treatment of gas scattering to 
provide detailed information on the unscattered beam elec-
trons as well as the spatial distribution of electrons scattered 
</p>
<p>into the skirt. The VPSEM menu of DTSA-II allows selection

through 100&nbsp;Pa of water vapor. In addition to the radial dis-
tribution, the DTSA II Monte Carlo reports the unscattered 
fraction that remains in the focused beam, a value that is 
critical for estimating the likely success of VPSEM imaging, 
as described below.

<p>12.5  VPSEM Image Resolution
</p>
<p>Remarkably, despite the strong gas scattering and the develop-
ment of the skirt around the focused beam, the image resolu-
tion that can be achieved in VPSEM operation is very similar 
to that for the same specimen imaged at the same incident 
beam energy in a conventional high vacuum SEM.&nbsp;A compari-
son of high vacuum SEM and VPSEM imaging performance 
for gold islands on carbon using a modern thermal field emis-
sion gun SEM is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;12.8, showing comparable spa-
tial resolution, as originally demonstrated by Danilatos (1993). 
This extraordinary imaging performance in the VPSEM can be 
understood by recognizing that elastic scattering is a stochastic 
process. As beam electrons encounter the gas molecules and 
atoms in the elevated pressure region, elastic scattering events 
occur, but not every electron suffers elastic scattering immedi-
ately. There remains an unscattered fraction of electrons that 
follows the expected path defined by the objective lens field 
and lands in the focused beam footprint identical to the situa-
tion at high vacuum but with reduced intensity due to the gas 
scattering events that rob the beam of some of the electrons. As 
the gas scattering path, which is a product of working distance 
and the gas pressure, increases, the unscattered fraction of the 
beam decreases and eventually reaches zero intensity. The frac-
tion of unscattered electrons that remain in the beam can be 
calculated by the Monte Carlo simulation in DTSA-II, and an 
example is plotted in . Fig.&nbsp;12.9. For 20-keV electrons passing 
through 10&nbsp;mm of water vapor at 200&nbsp;Pa, approximately 20 % 
</p>
<p>of the original beam current reaches the specimen surface 
unscattered and contained within the focused beam. The elec-
trons that remain in the beam behave exactly as they would in 
a high vacuum SEM, creating the same interaction volume and 
generating secondary and backscattered electrons with exactly 
the same spatial distributions. The electrons that land in the 
scattering skirt also generate secondary and backscattered elec-
trons in response to the local specimen characteristics they 
encounter, for example, surface inclination, roughness, com-
position, an so on, which may be different from the region 
sampled by the focused beam. Because these skirt electron 
interactions effectively arise from a broad, diffuse area rather 
than a focused beam, they cannot respond to fine-scale spatial 
details of the specimen as the beam is scanned. The skirt elec-
trons interact over such a broad area that effectively they only 
contribute increased noise to the measurement, degrading the 
signal-to-noise ratio of the useful high resolution signal gener-
ated by the unscattered electrons that remain in the focused 
beam. This degraded signal-to-noise does degrade the visibility 
threshold, which can be compensated by increasing the beam 
current and/or by increasing the pixel dwell time. The degrada-
tion of feature visibility due to gas scattering has the most 
impact at the short pixel dwell times (high scan rates) that are 
typically selected for rapidly surveying a specimen to search for 
features of interest. The prudent VPSEM microscopist will 
always use long pixel dwell times to reduce the contrast visibil-
ity threshold to ensure that a low-contrast feature of interest 
can be observed.

<p>12.6  Detectors for&nbsp;Elevated Pressure 
Microscopy
</p>
<p>12.6.1  Backscattered Electrons&mdash;Passive 
Scintillator Detector
</p>
<p>As noted above, the E&ndash;T detector, or any other detector 
which employs a high accelerating voltage post-specimen, 
such as the channel plate multiplier, cannot be used at ele-
vated VPSEM pressures due to ionization of the gas atoms 
leading to large-scale electrical breakdown. The passive back-
scattered electron detectors, including the semiconductor 
and scintillator detectors, are suitable for elevated pressure, 
since the backscattered electrons suffer negligible energy loss 
while transiting the environmental gas and thus retain suffi-
cient energy to activate the scintillator without post- specimen 
acceleration. In fact, an added advantage of elevated pressure 
VPSEM operation is that the gas discharging allows the bare 
scintillator to be used without the metallic coating required 
for conventional high vacuum operation. An example of a 
VPSEM image of polymer foam prepared with a large sym-
metric BSE detector placed symmetrically above the speci-
men is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;12.10 (left).
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;12.11a shows an example of a BSE image of pol-
ished Raney nickel alloy obtained with a passive scintillator 
detector in water vapor at a pressure of 500&nbsp;Pa (3.8&nbsp;torr) with 
a beam energy of 20&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;This BSE image shows composi-
tional contrast similar to that observed under high vacuum 
conventional SEM imaging.
</p>
<p>12.6.2  Secondary Electrons&ndash;Gas 
Amplification Detector
</p>
<p>To utilize the low energy secondary electrons in the VPSEM, 
a special elevated pressure SE detector that utilizes ioniza-
tion of the environmental gas (gaseous secondary electron 
detector, GSED) has been developed (Danilatos 1990). As 
shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp; 12.12, an electrode (which 
may also serve as the final pressure limiting aperture) in 
close proximity to the electrically grounded specimen is 
maintained at a modest accelerating voltage of a few hun-
dred volts positive. The exact value of this applied voltage is 
selected so as not to exceed the breakdown voltage for the 
gas species and pressure being utilized. The SE emitted from 
the specimen are accelerated toward this electrode and 
undergo collisions with the gas molecules, ionizing them 
and creating positive ions and more free electrons. The 
mean free path for this process is a few tens of micrometers, 
depending on the gas pressure and the accelerating voltage, 
so that multiple generations of ionizing collisions can occur 
between SE emission from the specimen and collection at 
the positive electrode. Moreover, the electrons ejected from 
the gas atoms are also accelerated toward the wire and ion-
ize other gas atoms, resulting in a cascade of increasing 
charge carriers, progressively amplifying the current col-
lected at the electrode by a factor up to several hundred 
compared to the SE current originally emitted from the 
specimen. While BSE can also contribute to the total signal 
collected at the electrode by collisions with gas molecules,

</p>
<p>the mean free path for gas collisions increases rapidly with 
increasing electron energy thus decreasing the frequency of 
gas ionizations by the BSE.&nbsp; The contribution of the high 
energy BSE to the current amplification cascade is much 
less than that of the SE.&nbsp;To make simultaneous use of both 
the BSE and SE signals, a detector array such as that shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;12.13 can be utilized, combining an annular scintil-
lator BSE detector with the GSED.&nbsp;An example of the same 
area of the polished Raney nickel alloy simultaneously 
</p>
<p>obtained with the GSED is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;12.11b, operat-
ing under VPSEM conditions with water vapor at a pressure 
of 600&nbsp;Pa.
</p>
<p>Other variants of the GSED have been developed that 
make use of other physical phenomena that occur in the 
complex charged particle environment around the beam 
impact on the specimen, including the magnetic field induced 
by the motion of the charged particles and the cathodolumi-
nescence of certain environmental gases induced by the SE

<p>12.7  Contrast in&nbsp;VPSEM
</p>
<p>In general, the contrast mechanisms for the BSE and SE sig-
nals that are familiar from conventional high vacuum SEM 
operate in a similar fashion in VPSEM.&nbsp;For example, in the 
BSE detector image shown in . Fig.&nbsp;12.11a, most of the region 
of the Raney nickel alloy being viewed consists of a flat pol-
ished surface. Close examination of this image reveals atomic 
</p>
<p>number (compositional) contrast from the flat surface that is 
consistent with what would be observed for this specimen 
with the BSE signal in a conventional high vacuum SEM 
operating at the same beam energy. This same atomic num-
ber contrast can be observed in the simultaneously recorded 
GSED SE image in . Fig.&nbsp; 12.11b. Atomic number contrast 
appears in the GSED SE image because of the atomic number 
dependence of the SE
</p>
<p>2
 class of secondary electrons that are 
</p>
<p>generated by the exiting BSEs and are thus subject to the same 
contrast mechanisms as the BSEs. This is again familiar con-
trast behavior equivalent to high vacuum SEM imaging expe-
rience with the E&ndash;T detector. An important difference in the 
VPSEM case is the loss of the large contribution to atomic 
number contrast made by the SE
</p>
<p>3
 class in a high vacuum 
</p>
<p>SEM.&nbsp;The SE
3
 contribution is not a significant factor in the 
</p>
<p>VPSEM since the SE
3
 are generated on the chamber walls and 
</p>
<p>objective lens outside of the accelerating field of the GSED 
and thus do not contribute to the SE signal.
</p>
<p>Most BSE and SE images can be interpreted from the 
experience of high vacuum SEM, but as in all SEM image 
interpretation, the microscopist must always consider the 
apparent illumination situation provided by the detector in 
use. The GSED class of detectors is effectively located very 
close to the incident beam and thus provide apparent illumi-
nation along the line-of-sight. Moreover, the degree of ampli-
fication increases with distance of the surface from the GSED 
detector. These characteristics of the GSED lead to an impor-
tant difference between . Fig.&nbsp; 12.11a, b. The deep cavity is 
much brighter in the GSED image compared to the BSE 
image. The cavity walls and floor are fully illuminated by the 
electron beam and fine scale features can be captured at the 
bottom, as shown in the progressive image sequence in 
. Fig.&nbsp;12.14. The differing contrast in these images is a result 
of the relative positions and signal responses of the BSE and 
GSED detectors. Both detectors are annular, but the GSED 
detector is effectively looking along the beam and produces 
apparent lighting along the viewer&rsquo;s direction of sight. The 
annular BSE detector intercepts BSEs traveling at a minimum 
angle of approximately 20 degrees to the beam so that the 
effective lighting appears to come from outside the viewer&rsquo;s 
direction of sight. The cavity appears dark in the BSE image 
because although the primary beam strikes the walls and 
floor, there is no line-of-sight from cavity surfaces to the BSE 
detector. The BSEs are strongly reabsorbed by the walls and/or 
scattered out of the line-of-sight collection of the BSE detec-
tor. Because the environmental gas penetrates into the holes, 
as long as the primary beam can strike a surface and cause it 
to emit secondary electrons, the positive collection potential 
on the final pressure limiting aperture will attract electrons 
from the ionization cascade and generate a measurable SE sig-
nal, as shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;12.15 (Newbury 1996).

tional generations of cascade multiplication, increasing the 
signal compared to the flat surface of the specimen, making 
the cavities appear bright relative to the flat surface.

<p>Software is an essential tool for the scanning electron micros-
copist and X-ray microanalyst (SEMXM). In the past, soft-
ware was an important optional means of augmenting the 
electron microscope and X-ray spectrometer, permitting 
powerful additional analysis and enabling new characteriza-
tion methods that were not possible with bare instrumenta-
tion. Today, however, it is simply not possible to function as 
an SEMXM practitioner without using at least a minimal 
amount of software. A graphical user interface (GUI) is an 
integral part of how the operator controls the hardware on 
most modern microscopes, and in some cases it is the only 
interface. Even many seemingly analog controls such as focus 
knobs, magnification knobs, or stigmators are actually digital 
interfaces mounted on hand-panel controllers that connect to 
the microscope control computer via a USB interface.
</p>
<p>In addition to its role in data acquisition, software is now 
indispensable in the processing, exploration, and visualiza-
tion of SEMXM data and analysis results. Fortunately, most 
manufacturers provide high-quality commercial software 
packages to support the hardware they sell and to aid the 
analyst in the most common materials characterization tasks. 
Usually this software has been carefully engineered, often at 
great cost, and smart analysts will take advantage of this soft-
ware whenever it meets their needs. However, closed-source 
commercial software suffers from several limitations. Because 
the source code is not available for inspection, the procedures 
and algorithms used by the software cannot be checked for 
accuracy or completeness, and must be accepted as a &ldquo;black 
box.&rdquo; Further, it is often very difficult to modify closed source 
software, either to add missing features needed by the analyst 
or to customize the workflow to meet specific job require-
ments. In this regard, open source software is more flexible 
and more extensible. The cost of commercial software pack-
ages can also be a downside, especially in an academic or 
teaching environment or in any situation where many dupli-
cate copies of the software are required. Clearly a no-cost, 
open source solution is preferable to a high-cost commercial 
application if you need to install 50 copies for instructional 
purposes.
</p>
<p>One of the most popular free and open source software 
packages for SEM image analysis is ImageJ, a Java program 
that has grown over the decades from a small application 
started at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) into a large 
international collaboration with hundreds of contributors 
and many, many thousands of users (7 http://imagej.net).
</p>
<p>13.1  The ImageJ Universe
</p>
<p>ImageJ has grown into a large and multifaceted suite of 
related tools, and how all these parts fit together (and which 
are useful for SEM and X-ray microanalysis) may not be 
immediately obvious. The project began in the late 1970s 
when Wayne Rasband, working at NIH, authored a simple 
image processing program in the Pascal programming lan-
guage that he called Image. This original application ran only 
on the PDP-11, but in 1987 when the Apple Macintosh II was 
</p>
<p>becoming popular, Rasband undertook the development of a 
Mac version of the tool called NIH Image. Largely to enable 
cross-platform compatibility and to allow non-Macintosh 
users to run the program, it was again rewritten, this time 
using the Java programming language. The result was the first 
version of ImageJ in 1997 (Schneider et&nbsp;al. 2012, 2015).
</p>
<p>The availability of ImageJ on the Microsoft PC and Unix 
platforms as well as Macintosh undoubtedly added to its 
popularity, but just as important was the decision to create an 
open software architecture that encouraged contributions 
from a large community of interested software developers. As 
a result, ImageJ benefitted from a prodigious number of code 
submissions in the form of macros and plugins as well as edits 
to the core application itself. Partly to manage this organic 
growth of the package, partly to reorganize the code base, and 
in part to introduce improvements that could not be added 
incrementally, NIH funded the ImageJ2 project in 2009 to 
overhaul this widely useful and very popular program, and to 
create a more robust and more capable foundation for future 
enhancements (7 http://imagej.net/ImageJ2).
</p>
<p>Both ImageJ and ImageJ2 have benefitted from indepen-
dent software development projects that interoperate with 
these programs. The Bio-Formats file I/O library as well as 
other related projects led by the Laboratory for Optical and 
Computational Instrumentation (LOCI) at the University of 
Wisconsin (7 https://loci.wisc.edu) are important resources 
in the ImageJ universe and have added valuable functional-
ity. The Bio-Formats project responded to the community&rsquo;s 
need for software that would read and write the large num-
ber of vendor-supplied image file formats, mostly for light 
microscopy (LM). Today the Bio-Formats library goes well 
beyond LM vendor formats and encompasses 140 different 
file types, including many useful for SEMXM, such FEI and 
JEOL images, multi-image TIFFs (useful for EDS multi- 
element maps), movie formats like AVI for SEM time-lapse 
imaging, etc. A follow-on LOCI project called SCIFIO aims 
to extend the I/O library&rsquo;s scope to include N-dimensional 
files (Hiner et&nbsp;al. 2016). Both projects are closely associated 
with the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) project and 
the OME consortium (7 http://www.openmicroscopy.org). 
Similarly, the ImgLib2 project aims to provide a neutral, Java- 
based computational library for processing N-dimensional 
scientific datasets of the kind targeted by SCIFIO (Pietzsch 
et&nbsp;al. 2012).
</p>
<p>Given the complexity of this rapidly evolving ecosystem 
of interrelated and interoperable tools that support ImageJ, it 
is not surprising that some users find it difficult to under-
stand how all the pieces fit together and how to exploit all the 
power available in this software suite. Fortunately, there is a 
simple way to access much of this power: by installing Fiji.
</p>
<p>13.2  Fiji
</p>
<p>Fiji, which is a recursive acronym that stands for &ldquo;Fiji Is Just 
ImageJ,&rdquo; is a coherent distribution of ImageJ2 that is easy to 
install and comes pre-bundled with a large collection of  useful

<p>plugins and enhancements to the bare ImageJ2 application 
(Schindelin et&nbsp;al. 2012). It is often thought of as &ldquo;ImageJ with 
Batteries Included.&rdquo; The Fiji website provides several conve-
nient installation packages for both the 32-bit and 64-bit ver-
sions of Fiji for common operating systems such as Microsoft 
Windows (currently Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10) and 
Linux (on amd64 and x86 architectures). Pre-built and tested 
versions for Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and later are also 
available. By default, these bundles include a version of the 
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) configured for Fiji&rsquo;s use that 
can coexist with other instances of Java on the host computer, 
but &ldquo;bare&rdquo; distributions of Fiji are available that will attempt 
to utilize your computer&rsquo;s existing JRE if that is preferred. Of 
course, as an Open Source software project, all of the source 
code for Fiji can be downloaded.
</p>
<p>Installation of Fiji is straightforward because it has been 
configured as a portable application, meaning it is designed to 
</p>
<p>run from its own directory as a standalone application. 
Installation is as simple as downloading the distribution and 
unpacking it; Fiji does not use an installer, does not copy 
shared libraries into destination directories scattered around 
the file system, and it does not store configuration information 
in system databases (e.g., the Windows registry). Because of 
this design, once installed it can be moved or copied simply by 
moving the directory tree. This portability also means it runs 
quite well from a USB flash drive or removable hard drive.
</p>
<p>After launching Fiji you will be presented with the Fiji 
main window (. Fig.&nbsp; 13.1a), which contains the Menu bar, 
the Tools bar, and a Status bar for messages and other appli-
cation feedback to the user. Selecting &ldquo;Update&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Update 
Fiji&rdquo; on the Help menu will trigger the updater, one of the 
most useful features of Fiji. Because Fiji is configured by 
default to start the updater immediately after program 
launch, for many new users this is the first piece of Fiji

<p> functionality they encounter. Upon activation the updater 
will scan your local Fiji installation and calculate checksums 
for everything to see if any components are out-of-date, or if 
new features have been added since it was last run. It will 
then confer with the global Fiji code repositories to look for 
updated Java Archive files (.jar files) and offer to download 
and install them for the user. . Figure&nbsp;13.1b shows an exam-
ple of this, where the updater has located numerous changes 
in the ImageJ, Fiji, and Bio-Formats repositories. By select-
ing the &ldquo;Apply changes&rdquo; button the software will fetch the 
latest code and apply all the patches to the user&rsquo;s local Fiji 
installation. . Figure&nbsp;13.2 shows a window listing a selection 
of available Fiji update sites illustrating the rich community 
resources.
</p>
<p>13.3  Plugins
</p>
<p>One of the most powerful features of Fiji is the enormous 
collection of plugins, macros, and other extensions that have 
been developed by third-party contributors in the scientific 
</p>
<p> community. Fiji comes with some of the most useful plugins 
pre-installed, and these are accessible from the Plugins menu 
item. Hundreds of powerful features are accessible this way, 
exposed to the user in a series of cascading menus and sub-
menus. Such a large set of choices can be overwhelming at 
first, but many of the plugins are meant for light microscopy, 
so the SEM analyst may find it simpler to ignore some of 
them. However, the Non-local means denoising plugin, the 
Optic flow plugin, and the myriad of morphological opera-
tions under the Plugins|Process menu are all useful for SEM 
microscopists, as are the dozens of features in the Registration, 
Segmentation, Stacks, Stitching, Transform, and Utilities 
submenus.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the appearance of a plugin as a single entry in 
the Fiji menu structure belies the full power of that plugin. 
Indeed, some of the most impressive plugins available for Fiji 
might be considered entire image processing packages in their 
own right. An example of this is the Trainable WEKA Classifier 
plugin that appears as a single entry on the Segmentation sub-
menu of the Plugins menu. WEKA is an acronym that stands 
for &ldquo;Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis,&rdquo; a tool 
</p>
<p>       . Fig. 13.2 Fiji&rsquo;s Manage

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>191 13
</p>
<p>developed by the Machine Learning Group at the University 
of Waikato in New Zealand (Hall et&nbsp;al. 2009). WEKA is a full-
featured and very popular open source software suite written 
in Java for machine learning (ML) researchers. It provides an 
open, cross-platform workbench for common ML tasks such 
as data mining, feature selection, clustering, classification, and 
regression, going well beyond just image analysis. The Fiji plu-
gin is a gateway into this large array of tools and provides a 
convenient interface for processing SEM images using a mod-
ern machine learning framework (7 http://imagej.net/
Trainable_Weka_Segmentation).
</p>
<p>Some of the most widely used and powerful plugins in 
Fiji have been back-ported into ImageJ itself, and are avail-
able directly from the main application&rsquo;s menu structure. An 
example of this is the Process menu option known as 
&ldquo;Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization,&rdquo; or 
CLAHE (Zuiderveld 1994). First developed in 1994, this 
algorithm has been implemented in a wide variety of image 
processing tools. It is designed to amplify local contrast by 
performing histogram equalization on small subsets (tiles) 
within the source image, but to limit the allowed amplifica-
tion to reduce the tendency to magnify the noise in relatively 
homogeneous patches. . Figure&nbsp;13.3a shows a scanning elec-
tron micrograph of microfabricated features on silicon, 
acquired at 20&nbsp; keV using an Everhart&ndash;Thornley detector. 
Because of slight misalignment of the raster with the linear 
features, Moir&eacute; contrast is evident in the image as bright 
edges on some features, and there are pure white and pure 
black horizontal lines that have been added to simulate con-
trast artifacts. These extreme limits of intensity preclude the 
usual brightness/contrast adjustments, but the CLAHE algo-
rithm recovers invisible details without loss of information, 
. Fig.&nbsp;13.3b.
</p>
<p>While it is possible that the ideal software tool for your 
project is available in Fiji itself (e.g., CLAHE) or in one of 
the many plugins loaded into Fiji by default (e.g., Trainable 
Weka Segmentation), it is much more likely that the tool 
you are looking for is not in the distribution you down-
loaded from the Fiji website. Only a small fraction of the 
plugins available to the user have been installed in the 
menu tree. A much larger collection awaits the user who is 
willing to explore the many optional Fiji update sites. The 
Updater window shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 13.1b has a &ldquo;Manage 
update sites&rdquo; button at the lower left. If you press this but-
ton you are presented with a list of optional plugin reposi-
tories, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 13.4a. When checked, these 
additional update sites will be accessed and used by the 
Updater to find new functionality to add into the base dis-
tribution. Some of the sites shown in . Fig.&nbsp;13.4a only add 
one or two items to the Plugins menu, while others import 
</p>
<p>a much larger amount of supplemental code and capability. 
For example, the &ldquo;Cookbook&rdquo; site listed in . Fig.&nbsp;13.4a adds 
a new top-level menu item to the Fiji main window, as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 13.4b. This new menu contains example 
code to help new users follow along with a community- 
written tutorial introduction to ImageJ, available on the 
ImageJ website (7 http://imagej.net/Cookbook).
</p>
<p>Occasionally a set of useful plugins will be written by a 
researcher or contributor who is unable or unwilling to make 
them available as an update site. The ImageJ website offers 
free hosting of update sites for any author of plugins, and 
organizations can run their own Fiji update sites if they wish. 
If these are not already a selectable option on the Manage 
update sites list (. Fig.&nbsp;13.4a), the &ldquo;Add update site&rdquo; button 
allows the user to manually follow a third-party update site. 
As a last resort, plugins may also be manually installed into 
the Fiji plugins directory, but they will not be automatically 
updated so this is discouraged.
</p>
<p>Thus, there are really four tiers of plugins across the 
ImageJ universe: (1) core ImageJ plugins that are bundled 
into the base ImageJ package (more than 1000 plugins in 
2016); (2) core Fiji plugins, included by default in the 
&ldquo;Batteries Included&rdquo; Fiji distributions (more than 1000 addi-
tional plugins in 2016); (3) plugins available from additional 
update sites; and (4) plugins that must be located, down-
loaded, and installed manually. While this last category of 
plugins is the most likely to be buggy and poorly supported, 
any plugin written by a co-worker or officemate will often fall 
into this category, so the code may be highly specific to your 
task or your organization&mdash;don&rsquo;t overlook these!
</p>
<p>13.4  Where to&nbsp;Learn More
</p>
<p>Learning ImageJ or Fiji can be a daunting task for the 
beginner, and no attempt was made here to provide even a 
basic introduction to opening, exploring, manipulating, 
and saving SEM micrographs or X-ray data. However, there 
are many excellent resources for learning Fiji on the web, 
and the community offers several support channels for 
those who need additional help. Fiji itself has a built-in 
Help menu with links to the ImageJ and Fiji websites, news-
groups, online documentation, example code, developer 
tools, guidance documents, etc. The ImageJ Help page 
maintains links to the ImageJ Forum, Chat Room, and IRC 
channel as well as pointers to the ImageJ tag on Stack 
Overflow and Reddit, popular online locations for ImageJ 
and Fiji questions and answers. Finally, there is a synoptic 
search engine for many of the above resources at 7 http://
search.imagej.net.

<p>14.1  Specimen Considerations (High 
 Vacuum SEM; Specimen Chamber 
Pressure &lt; 10&minus;3 Pa)
</p>
<p>14.1.1  Conducting or Semiconducting 
Specimens
</p>
<p>A conducting or semiconducting specimen must maintain 
good contact with electrical ground to dissipate the injected 
beam current. Without such an electrical path, even a highly 
conducting specimen such as a metal will show charging arti-
facts, in the extreme case acting as an electron mirror and 
reflecting the beam off the specimen. A typical strategy is to 
use an adhesive such as double-sided conducting tape to 
both grip the specimen to a support, for example, a stub or a 
planchet, as well as to make the necessary electrical path con-
nection. Note that some adhesives may only be suitable for 
low magnification (scanned field dimensions greater than 
100 &times; 100&nbsp;μm, nominally less than 1,000&times; magnification) and 
intermediate magnification (scanned field dimensions 
between 100 μm x 100 μm, nominally less than 1,000&times; mag-
nification and 10&nbsp;μm &times; 10&nbsp;μm, nominally less than 10,000&times; 
magnification) due to dimensional changes which may occur 
as the adhesive outgases in the SEM leading to image insta-
bility such as drift. Good practice is to adequately outgas the 
mounted specimen in the SEM airlock or a separate vacuum 
system to minimize contamination in the SEM as well as to 
minimize further dimensional shrinkage. Note that some 
adhesive media are also subject to dimensional change due to 
electron radiation damage during imaging, which can also 
lead to image drift.
</p>
<p>14.1.2  Insulating Specimens
</p>
<p>For SEM imaging above the low beam energy range 
(E
</p>
<p>0
 &le; 5&nbsp; keV), insulating specimens must be coated with a 
</p>
<p>suitable conducting layer to dissipate the charge injected by 
the beam and avoid charging artifacts. Note that after this 
layer is applied, a connection to electrical ground must be 
established for the coating to be effective. For tall speci-
mens, the side of the specimen may not receive adequate 
coating to create a conducting path. A small strip of adhe-
sive tape may be used for this purpose, running from the 
coating to the conducting stub. Note that for complex 
shapes, surfaces that do not receive the coating due to geo-
metric shading may still accumulate charge even if not 
directly exposed to the beam due to re-scattering of back-
scattered electrons (BSEs).
</p>
<p>To optimize imaging, the conductive coating should have 
a high secondary electron coefficient (e.g., Au-Pd, Cr, 
platinum- family metals). While thermally evaporated car-
bon is an effective, tough coating suitable for elemental X-ray 
microanalysis, the low secondary electron coefficient of car-
bon makes it a poor choice for imaging, especially for high 
resolution work involving high magnification where estab-
lishing visibility is critical.
</p>
<p>The coating should be the thinnest possible that is effective 
at discharging the specimen, typically a few nanometers or 
less for ion-sputtered coatings. For high resolution imaging, 
the coating material should be chosen to have the least possi-
ble structure, for example, Au-Pd, which produces a continu-
ous fine-grained layer, rather than pure Au, which tends to 
produce discontinuous islands.
</p>
<p>Uncoated insulating specimens can be successfully imaged 
with minimum charging artifacts by carefully choosing the beam 
energy, typically in the range 0.1&nbsp;keV&ndash;5&nbsp;keV with the exact value 
dependent on the material, specimen topography, tilt, beam cur-
rent, and scan speed to achieve a charge-neutral condition in 
which the charge injected by the beam is matched by the charge 
ejected as backscattered electrons and secondary electrons.
</p>
<p>14.2  Electron Signals Available
</p>
<p>14.2.1  Beam Electron Range
</p>
<p>Beam electrons penetrate into the specimen spreading laterally 
through elastic scattering and losing energy through inelastic 
scattering creating the interaction volume (IV). The Kanaya&ndash;
Okayama range equation gives the total penetration distance 
(for a beam incident perpendicular to the specimen surface): 
</p>
<p>R E
K - ( ) = ( ) ( )0 0 0nm   27 6 A Z  89 1 67. / . .r
</p>
<p> 
(14.1)
</p>
<p>where A is the atomic weight (g/mol), Z is the atomic num-
ber, ρ is the density (g/cm3), and E
</p>
<p>0
 is the incident beam 
</p>
<p>energy (keV).
</p>
<p>14.2.2  Backscattered Electrons 
</p>
<p>BSEs are beam electrons that escape the specimen after one 
or many elastic scattering events. The BSE coefficient 
increases with increasing atomic number of the target (com-
positional contrast) and with increasing tilt of a surface 
(topographic contrast). BSEs have a wide spectrum of kinetic 
energy, but over half retain a significant fraction, 50 % or 
more, of the incident beam energy. BSE sample specimen 
depths as great as 0.15 (high Z) to 0.3 (low Z) of R
</p>
<p>K&ndash;O
 and 
</p>
<p>spread laterally by 0.2 (high Z) to 0.5 (low Z) of R
K&ndash;O
</p>
<p>. From a 
flat surface normal to the incident beam, BSEs follow a cosine 
angular distribution (angle measured relative to the surface 
normal), while for tilted flat surfaces, the angular distribu-
tion becomes more strongly peaked in the forward direction 
with increasing surface tilt.
</p>
<p>14.2.3  Secondary Electrons 
</p>
<p>Secondary electrons (SEs) are specimen electrons that are 
ejected through beam electron&nbsp;&ndash; atom interactions. SE have a 
distribution of kinetic energy which peaks at a few electron-
volts. SEs sample only a few nanometers into the specimen 
due to this low kinetic energy. SE emission increases strongly 
</p>
<p>14.2 &middot; Electron Signals Available</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>198
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>with surface tilt (topographic contrast). SE emission increases 
as the beam energy decreases. Three classes of SEs are recog-
nized: (1) SE
</p>
<p>1
 are produced as the beam electrons enter the 
</p>
<p>specimen surface within footprint of the beam, potentially 
carrying high resolution information, and are sensitive to the 
first few nm below the surface. (2) SE
</p>
<p>2
 are produced as beam 
</p>
<p>electrons exit as BSEs and are actually sensitive to BSE charac-
teristics (lateral and depth sampling). (3) SE
</p>
<p>3
 are produced as 
</p>
<p>the BSEs strike the objective lens and specimen chamber 
walls, and are also sensitive to BSE characteristics (lateral and 
depth sampling). SEs are sensitive to electrical and magnetic 
fields, and even a few volts of surface potential (&ldquo;charging&rdquo;) 
can alter SE trajectories and eventual collection.
</p>
<p>14.3  Selecting the&nbsp;Electron Detector
</p>
<p>14.3.1  Everhart&ndash;Thornley Detector 
(&ldquo;Secondary Electron&rdquo; Detector)
</p>
<p>Virtually all SEMs are equipped with an Everhart&ndash;Thornley 
detector, often referred to as the &ldquo;secondary electron (SE)&rdquo; 
detector. While SEs constitute a large fraction of the E&ndash;T sig-
nal, the E&ndash;T detector is also sensitive to BSEs directly and indi-
rectly through the collection of SE
</p>
<p>2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
. The E&ndash;T detector 
</p>
<p>is the usual choice for imaging problems involving fine spatial 
details. The effective collection angle for SEs is nearly 2π sr. 
Some E&ndash;T detectors allow user selection of the potential 
applied to the SE-collecting Faraday cage so that the SE signal 
can be minimized or eliminated leaving a BSE signal. This BSE 
signal is collected over a very small solid angle, ~ 0.01&nbsp;sr.
</p>
<p>14.3.2  Backscattered Electron Detectors
</p>
<p>Most SEMs are also equipped with a &ldquo;dedicated&rdquo; backscattered 
electron detector which has no sensitivity to SEs. Passive scin-
tillator BSE detectors and semiconductor BSE detectors are 
typically placed on the bottom of the objective lens above the 
specimen, giving a large solid angle of collection approaching 
2π sr. Both types have an energy threshold below which there is 
no response, the value of which depends on the particular 
detector in use and is typically in the range 1&nbsp;keV to 5&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;Above 
this threshold, the detector response increases nearly linearly 
with BSE energy, creating a modest energy selectivity.
</p>
<p>14.3.3  &ldquo;Through-the-Lens&rdquo; Detectors
</p>
<p>Some high performance SEMs include &ldquo;through-the-lens&rdquo; 
(TTL) detectors which use the strong magnetic field of the 
objective lens to capture SEs. The collection is restricted to the 
SE
</p>
<p>1
 and SE
</p>
<p>2
 signals, with the SE
</p>
<p>3
 component excluded. Since 
</p>
<p>SE
3
 actually carry lower resolution BSE information, exclud-
</p>
<p>ing SE
3
 benefits high resolution imaging. TTL BSE detectors 
</p>
<p>capture the portion of the BSEs emitted into the bore of the 
lens. Some TTL SE and TTL BSE detectors can energy filter 
the signal-carrying electrons according to their energy.
</p>
<p>14.4  Selecting the&nbsp;Beam Energy for&nbsp;SEM 
Imaging
</p>
<p>The optimum beam energy depends on the nature of the 
imaging problem to be solved. The location of the feature (s) 
of interest on the surface or within the specimen; the contrast 
generating mechanism (s), and the degree of spatial resolu-
tion to be achieved are examples of factors to be considered.
</p>
<p>14.4.1  Compositional Contrast 
With&nbsp;Backscattered Electrons
</p>
<p>Choose E
0
 &ge; 10&nbsp; keV: Above 5&nbsp; keV, electron backscattering 
</p>
<p>follows a nearly monotonic increase with atomic number, 
resulting in easily interpretable compositional contrast (aka 
&ldquo;atomic number contrast&rdquo;; &ldquo;Z-contrast&rdquo;). Because of the 
energy threshold of the passive scintillator BSE detector and 
semiconductor BSE detector (~1&nbsp;keV to 5&nbsp;keV), by selecting 
E
</p>
<p>0
 &ge; 10&nbsp; keV the BSE detector will operate reliably with the 
</p>
<p>energy spectrum of BSEs produced by the specimen. For 
maximum compositional contrast, a flat polished specimen 
should be placed at 00 tilt (i.e., perpendicular to the beam).
</p>
<p>14.4.2  Topographic Contrast 
With&nbsp;Backscattered Electrons
</p>
<p>Choose E
0
 &ge; 10&nbsp;keV: BSE detectors can respond strongly to 
</p>
<p>variations in specimen topography, so the same beam energy 
conditions apply as for compositional contrast (7 Sect. 14.4.1) 
to assure efficient BSE detector response. Local variations in 
the specimen surface tilt cause BSEs to travel in different 
directions. BSE topographic contrast is maximized by a small 
BSE detector placed on one side of the beam (e.g., Everhart&ndash;
Thornley detector with zero or negative Faraday cage bias) 
and minimized by large BSE detectors placed symmetrically 
around the beam (e.g., large passive scintillator or semicon-
ductor detector).
</p>
<p>14.4.3  Topographic Contrast 
With&nbsp;Secondary Electrons
</p>
<p>Choose any E
0
 within the operating range: Topographic con-
</p>
<p>trast is usually viewed in &ldquo;secondary electron&rdquo; images pre-
pared with the E&ndash;T detector, positively biased for SE 
collection. The E&ndash;T detector is designed to efficiently collect 
and detect SEs, which are produced at all incident beam 
energies and are maximized at low beam energy.
</p>
<p>14.4.4  High Resolution SEM Imaging
</p>
<p>Two beam energy strategies optimize imaging fine-scale 
details by maximizing the contribution of the SE that are pro-
duced within the footprint of the focused beam:
</p>
<p> Chapter 14 &middot; SEM Imaging Checklist</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>199 14
</p>
<p> Strategy 1
</p>
<p>Choose the highest available beam energy, E
0
 &ge; 25&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;The SE
</p>
<p>1
 
</p>
<p>component of the total SE signal retains the high resolution 
information at the scale of the beam entrance footprint. Due to 
lateral spreading of the interaction volume, the BSE and their 
associated SE
</p>
<p>2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
 signals actually degrade spatial resolu-
</p>
<p>tion at intermediate beam energy (e.g., 5&nbsp;keV to 20&nbsp;keV). As the 
beam energy increases, the electron range increases as E
</p>
<p>0
1.67, 
</p>
<p>causing the lateral spreading of BSEs to increase. When these 
signal components are spread out as much as possible by using 
the maximum beam energy, their contribution diminishes 
toward random noise, while the high resolution SE
</p>
<p>1
 contribu-
</p>
<p>tion remains. Degraded signal- to- noise means that longer pixel 
dwell will be necessary to establish visibility of weak contrast. 
An additional advantage is the improvement in gun brightness, 
which increases linearly with E
</p>
<p>0
, so that more beam current can 
</p>
<p>be obtained in the focused beam of a given size.
</p>
<p> Strategy 2
</p>
<p>Choose low beam energy, E
0
 &le; 2&nbsp;keV: as the beam energy is 
</p>
<p>reduced, the electron range decreases as E
0
</p>
<p>1.67, which col-
lapses the BSE and associated SE
</p>
<p>2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
 signals to dimen-
</p>
<p>sions approaching that of the footprint of the focused beam 
which defines the SE
</p>
<p>1
 distribution. These abundant BSE, SE
</p>
<p>2
 
</p>
<p>and SE
3
 signals thus contribute to the high resolution signal 
</p>
<p>rather than degrading it. Although there is a significant pen-
alty in gun brightness imposed by low beam energy opera-
tion, the increased abundance of the high resolution signals 
partially compensates for the loss in gun brightness.
</p>
<p>14.5  Selecting the&nbsp;Beam Current
</p>
<p>14.5.1  High Resolution Imaging
</p>
<p>Imaging fine spatial details requires a small beam diameter, 
which requires choosing a strong first condenser lens that 
inevitably restricts the beam current to a low value. Beam cur-
rent (I
</p>
<p>B
), beam diameter (d), and beam divergence (α) are 
</p>
<p>related through the Brightness (β) Equation:
</p>
<p>( )2 2 2B  4 I / db = p a
 
</p>
<p>(14.2)
</p>
<p>Using a small beam for high resolution inevitably restricts the 
beam current available. An important consequence of operating 
with low beam current is poor visibility of low contrast features.
</p>
<p>14.5.2  Low Contrast Features Require High 
Beam Current and/or Long Frame 
Time to Establish Visibility
</p>
<p>Contrast (C
tr
), C
</p>
<p>tr
 = (S
</p>
<p>2
&nbsp;&ndash; S
</p>
<p>1
)/S
</p>
<p>2
, where S
</p>
<p>2
 &gt; S
</p>
<p>1
, arises when the 
</p>
<p>properties of a feature (e.g., composition, mass thickness, and/
or surface tilt) cause a difference in the BSE (η) and/or SE (δ) 
thus altering the measured signal, S
</p>
<p>feature
 = S
</p>
<p>2
, compared to the 
</p>
<p>background signal, S
background
</p>
<p> = S
1
, from adjacent parts of the 
</p>
<p>specimen. The visibility of this contrast depends on satisfying 
the Threshold Current Equation:
</p>
<p>I  4 pA  DQE C  tth tr F&gt; ( )/ d 2  (14.3a)
or in terms of the contrast threshold as
</p>
<p>Cth  SQRT 4 pA IB  DQE tF&gt; ( )&eacute;&euml; &ugrave;&ucirc;/ d  (14.3b)
where δ is the secondary electron coefficient (η if imaging 
with backscattered electrons), DQE is the detective quantum 
efficiency (effectively the fraction of the collected electrons&mdash;
detector solid angle and detection&mdash;that contribute to the 
measured signal), and t
</p>
<p>F
 is the frame time (s) for a 1024 by 
</p>
<p>1024-pixel image. Lower values of C
th
</p>
<p> can be obtained with 
higher beam current and/or longer frame times. For any selec-
tion of beam current and frame time, there is always a threshold 
contrast below which features will not be visible.
</p>
<p>14.6  Image Presentation
</p>
<p>14.6.1  &ldquo;Live&rdquo; Display Adjustments
</p>
<p>After the visibility threshold has been established for a contrast 
level C
</p>
<p>th
 through appropriate selection of beam current and 
</p>
<p>frame time, the imaging signal must be manipulated to prop-
erly present this contrast on the final image display. An image 
histogram function allows monitoring of the distribution of 
the displayed signal. Ideally, the signal amplification parame-
ters (e.g., &ldquo;contrast&rdquo; and &ldquo;gain&rdquo; or other designations) are 
adjusted so signal variations span nearly the entire gray- scale 
range of the digitizer (8-bit, 0&ndash; 255) without reaching pure 
white (level 255) to avoid saturation or pure black (level 0) to 
avoid &ldquo;bottoming&rdquo;; both conditions cause loss of information.
</p>
<p>14.6.2  Post-Collection Processing
</p>
<p>Provided that the signal has been properly digitized (no satu-
ration or bottoming), various digital image processing algo-
rithms can be applied to the stored image to improve the 
displayed image, including contrast and brightness adjust-
ment, non-linear expansion of a portion of the gray scale 
range, edge enhancements, and many others. ImageJ-Fiji 
provides a free open source platform of these software tools.
</p>
<p>14.7  Image Interpretation
</p>
<p>14.7.1  Observer&rsquo;s Point of&nbsp;View
</p>
<p>The SEM image is interpreted as if the observer is looking 
along the incident electron beam. Your eye is the beam!
</p>
<p>14.7.2  Direction of&nbsp;Illumination
</p>
<p>The apparent source of illumination is from the position of 
the detector. The detector is the apparent flashlight!

</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>14.7.3  Contrast Encoding
</p>
<p>SEM image contrast is carried by number effects (different 
numbers of electrons leave the specimen because of local prop-
erties), trajectory effects (differences in the directions electrons 
travel after leaving the specimen), and energy effects (some 
contrast mechanisms are more sensitive to higher energy BSEs).
</p>
<p>14.7.4  Imaging Topography With the 
Everhart&ndash;Thornley Detector
</p>
<p>We are strongly conditioned to expect &ldquo;top lighting&rdquo;; that is, 
the illumination of a scene comes from above (e.g., sun in the 
sky, lighting fixtures on the ceiling). The E&ndash;T detector (posi-
tively biased to collect SE) collects a complex mix of SEs and 
BSEs, which produces an image of topographic surfaces that 
is easily interpretable if the effective position of the E&ndash;T 
detector is at the top of the scanned image, achieving top 
lighting. This condition can be achieved by adjusting the 
&ldquo;scan rotation&rdquo; control to place the E&ndash;T detector at the top 
(i.e., 12 o&rsquo; clock position) of the scanned image (use a simple 
object like a particle&mdash;ideally a sphere&mdash;on a flat surface to 
establish the proper value of scan rotation). Brightly illumi-
nated features then are those that face upwards. With top 
lighting, most viewers will properly interpret the sense of 
topography. Stereomicroscopy techniques can be employed 
to reinforce the proper interpretation of topography.
</p>
<p>14.7.5  Annular BSE Detector 
(Semiconductor Sum Mode A + B 
and&nbsp;Passive Scintillator)
</p>
<p>Because the BSE detector surrounds the electron beam sym-
metrically, the illumination appears to be along the viewer&rsquo;s 
line-of-sight, much like looking along a flashlight beam. Surfaces 
perpendicular to the beam appear bright, tilted surfaces darker. 
These detectors favor number contrast mechanisms such as 
BSE compositional contrast (atomic number contrast).
</p>
<p>14.7.6  Semiconductor BSE Detector 
Difference Mode, A&minus;B
</p>
<p>The difference mode suppresses number effects but enhances 
trajectory effects such as topography.
</p>
<p>14.7.7  Everhart&ndash;Thornley Detector,

<p>15.1  Case Study: How High Is That Feature 
Relative to&nbsp;Another?
</p>
<p>When studying the topographic features of a specimen, the 
microscopist has several useful software tools available. 
Qualitative stereomicroscopy provides a composite view 
from two images of the same area, prepared with different 
tilts relative to the optic axis, that gives a visual sensation of 
the specimen topography, as shown for a fractured galena 
crystal using the anaglyph method in . Fig.&nbsp; 15.1 (software: 
Anaglyph Maker). The &ldquo;3D Viewer&rdquo; plugin in ImageJ-Fiji can 
take the same members of the stereo pair and render the 
</p>
<p>three-dimensional surface, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;15.2, which can 
then be rotated to &ldquo;view&rdquo; the surface from different orienta-
tions (. Fig.&nbsp;15.3).
</p>
<p>If the question is, How high is that feature relative to 
another?, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;15.4 for the step height indicated 
by the yellow arrow, then the methodology of quantitative 
stereomicroscopy can be applied. First, a set of X-Y- 
coordinates is established by locating features common to 
both members of the stereo pair; for example, in . Fig.&nbsp;15.5a 
the red crosshair is placed on a feature in the lower surface 
which will define the origin of coordinates (0, 0). A feature is 
similarly identified in the upper surface, for example, the 
particle marked by the blue crosshair in . Fig.&nbsp;15.5a and the 
red arrow in . Fig.&nbsp;15.5b. The principle of the parallax mea-
surement of the upper feature relative to the lower feature 
using these coordinate axes is illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp; 15.5b, c. 
What is needed is the difference in the X-coordinates of the 
lower and upper reference features to determine the length of 
the X-vector from the measurement axes, which is the paral-
lax for this feature. These measurements are conveniently 
made using the pixel coordinate feature in ImageJ-Fiji. By 
employing the expanded views presented in . Fig.&nbsp;15.6a, b for 
the left image, the individual pixels that define the reference 
points can be more readily seen, which improves the specific-
ity of the feature location within the two images to &plusmn;1&nbsp;pixel, 
minimizing this important source of measurement error. 
Having first calibrated the images using the &ldquo;Set Scale&rdquo; tool, 
the x- coordinate values from the pixel coordinate tool, from 
both the left and right images (with a tilt difference Δθ = 40 
with an estimated uncertainty of &plusmn;10), were used in the fol-
lowing calculations:

<p>Thus, the step represented by the yellow arrow in . Fig.&nbsp;15.4 
is 146.1&nbsp;μm &plusmn; 6 % above the origin of the yellow arrow. 
The estimated uncertainty has two major components: an 
uncertainty of 0.10 in the tilt angle difference contributes an 
uncertainty of &plusmn; 5 % to the calculated step height. A &plusmn; 
1&nbsp;pixel uncertainty in selecting the same reference pixels for 
the lower and upper features in both images contributes &plusmn; 
4 % to the calculated step height.
</p>
<p>15.2  Revealing Shallow Surface Relief
</p>
<p>Surfaces with topographic structures that create shallow sur-
face relief a few tens to hundreds of nanometers above the 
general surface provide special challenges to SEM imaging: 
(1) Shallow topography creates only small changes in the elec-
tron interaction volume and in the resulting emitted second-
ary electron (SE) and backscattered (BSE) signals as the beam 
is scanned across a feature, resulting in low contrast. (2) The 
strongest changes in the emitted signals from the weak topo-
graphic features will be found in the trajectory effects of the 
</p>
<p>BSE rather than in the numbers of the BSE or SE signals, so 
that an appropriate detector should be chosen that empha-
sizes the BSE trajectory component of topographic contrast. 
(3) Because the shallow relief is likely to provide very few 
&ldquo;clues&rdquo; as to the sense of the topography, it is critical to estab-
lish a condition of top lighting so that the sense of the local 
topography can be more easily determined. (4) Establishing 
the visibility of low contrast requires exceeding a high thresh-
old current, so that careful control of beam current will be 
necessary. (5) The displayed image must be contrast manipu-
lated to render the low contrast visible to the observer, which 
may be challenging if other sources of contrast are present.
</p>
<p>An example of the shallow surface relief imaging problem 
is illustrated by a highly polished specimen with a micro-
structure consisting of large islands of Fe
</p>
<p>3
C (cementite) in 
</p>
<p>pearlite (interpenetrating lath-like structures of Fe
3
C and an 
</p>
<p>iron- carbon solid solution). The strategy for obtaining a use-
ful image of this complex specimen is based on the realiza-
tion that the weak contrast from the shallow topography will 
be maximized with the BSE signal detected with a detector 
with a small solid angle of collection placed asymmetrically 
relative to the specimen and with a shallow detector elevation 
angle above the surface to produce the effect of oblique illu-
mination. The small solid angle means that most BSE trajec-
tories not directed into the detector will be lost, which 
actually increases the contrast. The asymmetric placement 
and shallow elevation angle ensures that the apparent illumi-
nation will come from a source that skims the surface, creat-
ing the effect of oblique illumination which creates strong 
shadows. The Everhart&ndash;Thornley (E&ndash;T) detector when

<p>biased negatively to reject SEs becomes a small solid angle 
BSE detector with these characteristics. The E&ndash;T detector is 
typically mounted so as to produce a shallow elevation angle 
relative to a specimen plane that is oriented perpendicular to 
the incident beam (0&deg; tilt for a planar specimen). Before pro-
ceeding with the imaging campaign, the relative position of 
the E&ndash;T detector is confirmed to be at the 12-o&rsquo;clock position 
in the image by using the &ldquo;scan rotation&rdquo; function and a 
specimen with known topography.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;15.7 shows an image of the iron-carbon micro-
structure with the negatively biased E&ndash;T detector placed at 
the top of the image. A high beam current (10&nbsp; nA) and a 
long dwell time (256&nbsp;μs per pixel) were used to establish the 
visibility of low contrast. The displayed contrast was 
expanded by first ensuring that the histogram of gray levels 
in the raw image was centered at mid-range and did not clip 
at the black or white ends. The &ldquo;brightness&rdquo; and &ldquo;contrast&rdquo; 
functions in ImageJ-Fiji were used to spread the input BSE 
</p>
<p>intensity levels over a larger gray-scale output range. The 
contrast can be interpreted as follows: With the apparent 
illumination established as coming from the top of the 
image, bright edges must therefore be facing upward, and 
conversely, dark edges must be facing away. Thus, the topog-
raphy of the Fe
</p>
<p>3
C islands can be seen to project slightly 
</p>
<p>above the general surface. This situation occurs because the 
Fe
</p>
<p>3
C is harder than the iron- carbon solid solution, so that 
</p>
<p>when this material is polished, the softer iron-carbon solid 
solution erodes slightly faster than the harder Fe
</p>
<p>3
C phase, 
</p>
<p>which then stands in slight relief above the iron-carbon solid 
solution.
</p>
<p>When this same field of view is imaged with the E&ndash;T 
detector positively biased, . Fig.&nbsp;15.8a, the same general con-
trast is seen, but there are significant differences in the fine- 
scale details. Several of these differences are highlighted in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 15.8b. (1) It is much easier to discern the numerous 
small pits (e.g., yellow circles) in the E&ndash;T(positive bias) image 
because of the strong &ldquo;bright edge&rdquo; effects that manifest along 
the lip of each hole. (2) There are small objects (e.g., blue 
circles) which appear in the E&ndash;T(negative bias) image but 
which appear anomalously dark in the E&ndash;T(positive bias) 
image. These objects are likely to be non-conducting oxide 
inclusions that are charging positively, which decreases SE 
collection.
</p>
<p>When this same field of view is imaged with the annular 
semiconductor BSE detector (sum mode, A + B) which pro-
vides apparent uniform, symmetric illumination along the 
beam, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;15.9, the contrast from the shallow 
topography of the edges of the Fe
</p>
<p>3
C islands is entirely lost, 
</p>
<p>whereas the compositional contrast (atomic number con-
trast) between the Fe
</p>
<p>3
C islands and the iron-carbon solid 
</p>
<p>solution and Fe
3
C lamellae is much more prominent.
</p>
<p>Finally, when the BSE difference mode (A &minus; B) mode is 
used, . Fig.&nbsp;15.10, the atomic number contrast is suppressed 
and the topographic contrast is enhanced. Note that the fea-
tures highlighted in the blue circles in . Fig.&nbsp; 15.8b are almost 
completely lost.

<p>15.3  Case Study: Detecting Ink-Jet Printer 
Deposits
</p>
<p>Ink-jet printing was used to deposit controlled quantities 
of reagents in individual droplets onto a polished carbon 
substrate in a project to create standards and test materials 
for instrumental microanalysis techniques such as sec-
ondary ion mass spectrometry. The spatial distribution of 
</p>
<p>the dried deposits was of interest, as well as any heteroge-
neity within the deposits, which required elemental 
microanalysis.
</p>
<p>The first critical step, detecting the ink-jet printed spots, 
proved to be a challenge because of the low contrast created 
by the thin, low mass deposit. Employing a low beam 
energy, E
</p>
<p>0
 &le; 5&nbsp;keV, and secondary electron imaging using 
</p>
<p>the positively biased Everhart&ndash;Thornley detector, maxi-
mized the contrast of the deposits, enabling detection of 
two different size classes of deposits, as seen in . Fig.&nbsp;15.11. 
When the beam energy was increased to enable the required 
elemental X-ray microanalysis, the visibility of the deposits 
diminished rapidly. Even with E
</p>
<p>0
 = 10&nbsp; keV, which is the 
</p>
<p>lowest practical beam energy to excite the K-shell X-rays of 
the transition metals, and a beam current of 10&nbsp; nA, the 
deposits were not visible in high scan rate (&ldquo;flicker free&rdquo;) 
imaging that is typically used when surveying large areas of 
a specimen to find features of interest. To reliably relocate 
the deposits at higher beam energy, a successful imaging 
strategy required both high beam current, for example, 
10&nbsp;nA, and long frame time, several seconds or longer, as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;15.12a&ndash;h. In this image series, the deposits 
are not visible at the shortest frame time of 0.79&nbsp;s, which is 
similar to the visual persistence of a rapid scanned image. 
The class of approximately 100-μm diameter deposits is 
fully visible in the 6.4&nbsp;s/frame image. As the frame time is 
successively extended to 100&nbsp;s, additional features of pro-
gressively lower contrast become visible with each increase 
in frame time.

</p>
<p>16.1  The Energy Dispersive Spectrometry 
(EDS) Process
</p>
<p>As illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;16.1, the physical basis of energy dis-
persive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) with a semiconductor 
detector begins with photoelectric absorption of an X-ray 
photon in the active volume of the semiconductor (Si). The 
entire energy of the photon is transferred to a bound inner 
shell atomic electron, which is ejected with kinetic energy 
equal to the photon energy minus the shell ionization energy 
(binding energy), 1.838&nbsp;keV for the Si K-shell and 0.098&nbsp;keV 
for the Si L-shell. The ejected photoelectron undergoes 
inelastic scattering within the Si crystal. One of the conse-
quences of the energy loss is the promotion of bound outer 
shell valence electrons to the conduction band of the semi-
conductor, leaving behind positively charged &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in the 
valence band. In the conduction band, the free electrons can 
move in response to a potential applied between the entrance 
surface electrode and the back surface electrode across the 
thickness of the Si crystal, while the positive holes in the con-
duction band drift in the opposite direction, resulting in the 
collection of electrons at the anode on the back surface of the 
EDS detector. This charge generation process requires 
approximately 3.6&nbsp;eV per electron hole pair, so that the num-
ber of charge carriers is proportional to the original photon 
energy, E
</p>
<p>p
:
</p>
<p>n E= p / 3.6eV  (16.1)
</p>
<p>For a Mn K-L
3
 photon with an energy of 5.895&nbsp;keV, approxi-
</p>
<p>mately 1638 electron&ndash;hole pairs are created, comprising a 
charge of 2.6 &times; 10&minus;16 coulombs. Because the detector can 
respond to any photon energy from a threshold of approxi-
mately 50&nbsp;eV to 30&nbsp;keV or more, the process has been named 
&ldquo;energy dispersive,&rdquo; although in the spectrometry sense there 
is no actual dispersion such as occurs in a diffraction element 
spectrometer.
</p>
<p>The original type of EDS was the lithium-drifted silicon 
[Si(Li)-EDS] detector (. Fig.&nbsp; 16.1a), with a uniform elec-
trode on the front and rear surfaces (Fitzgerald et&nbsp;al. 1968). 
Over the last 10 years, the Si(Li)-EDS has been replaced by 
the silicon drift detector design (SDD-EDS), illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp;16.1b (Gatti and Rehak 1984; Struder et&nbsp;al. 1998). The 
SDD-EDS uses the same detection physics with a uniform 
front surface electrode, but the rear surface electrode is a 
complex pattern of nested ring electrodes with a small cen-
tral anode. A pattern of potentials applied to the individual 
ring electrode creates an internal &ldquo;collection channel,&rdquo; which 
acts to bring free electrons deposited anywhere in the detec-
tor volume to the central anode for collection. (Note that in 
some designs the small anode is placed asymmetrically on 
one side in a &ldquo;teardrop&rdquo; shape.)
</p>
<p>The determination of the photon energy through the col-
lection and measurement of this charge deposited in the 
detector requires an extremely sensitive and sophisticated 
electronic system, which operates automatically under com-
puter control with only a limited number of parameters 
</p>
<p>under the user&rsquo;s control, as described below under &ldquo;Best 
Practices.&rdquo; The charge measurement in the detector provides 
the fundamental unit of information to construct the EDS 
spectrum, which is created in the form of a histogram in 
which the horizontal axis is a series of energy bins, and the 
vertical axis is the number of photons whose energy fits 
within that bin value. As shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.2, from the user&rsquo;s 
point of view this process of EDS detection can be considered 
simply as a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; which receives the X-ray photon, 
measures the photon energy, and increments the spectrum 
histogram being constructed in the computer memory by 
one unit at the appropriate energy bin. The typical photon 
energy range that can be measured by EDS starts at a thresh-
old of 0.05&nbsp;keV and extends to 30&nbsp;keV or even higher, depend-
ing on the detector design.

<p>16.1.1  The Principal EDS Artifact: Peak 
Broadening (EDS Resolution 
Function)
</p>
<p>If the EDS detection and measurement process were perfect, 
all the measurements for a particular characteristic X-ray 
peak would be placed in a single energy bin with a very nar-
row width. For example, the natural energy width of Mn K-L
</p>
<p>3
 
</p>
<p>is approximately 1.5&nbsp;eV.&nbsp;However, the number of electron&ndash;
hole pairs generated from a characteristic X-ray photon that 
is sharply defined in energy is nevertheless subject to natural 
statistical fluctuations. The number of charge carriers that are 
created follows the Gaussian (normal) distribution, so that 
the variation in the number of charge carriers, n, in repeated 
measurements of photons of the same energy is expected to 
follow 1σ = n&frac12;. The 1σ value for the 1638 charge carriers for 
the MnK-L
</p>
<p>3
 photon is approximately 40 electron-hole pairs, 
</p>
<p>which corresponds to a broadening contribution to the peak 
width of 0.024 (2.4 %) which can be compared to the natural 
width of 1.5&nbsp;eV/5895&nbsp;eV (from . Fig. 4.2), measured as the 
full peak width a half-maximum height (FWHM), or 0.00025 
(0.025 %), which is a broadening factor of approximately 100. 
The EDS peak width (FWHM) measured experimentally is a 
function of the photon energy, which can be estimated 
approximately as (Fiori and Newbury 1978)

mately the true width of the Mn K-family characteristic 
X-ray peaks. Of course, all photons that are measured are

</p>
<p>subject to the EDS resolution function, including the X-ray 
bremsstrahlung (continuum) background, but because the 
continuum is created at all energies up to E
</p>
<p>0
 and because of 
</p>
<p>its slow variation with photon energy, the distortions intro-
duced into the continuum background by the EDS resolution 
function are more difficult to discern.
</p>
<p>The major impact of peak broadening is the frequent 
occurrence in practical analytical situations of mutually 
interfering peaks that arise even with pure elements, for 
example, Si K-L
</p>
<p>3
 and Si K-M
</p>
<p>3
 and the Fe L-family. When 
</p>
<p>mixtures of elements are analyzed, Interferences are espe-
cially frequent when elements with atomic numbers above 20 
are present since these elements have increasingly complex 
spectra of L- and M- shell X-rays that have a wide energy 
span. A secondary impact of peak broadening occurs when 
trace elements are to be measured. Peak broadening has the 
effect of spreading the characteristic X-rays over a wide range 
of the X-ray continuum background. Variance in the back-
ground sets the ultimate limit of detection.
</p>
<p>16.1.2  Minor Artifacts: The&nbsp;Si-Escape Peak
</p>
<p>After photoelectric absorption by a silicon atom in the detec-
tor, the atom is left in an ionized excited state with a vacancy 
in the K- or L- shell. This excited state will decay by inter- 
shell electron transitions that result in the emission of a Si 
Auger electron (e.g., KLL), which will undergo inelastic scat-
tering and contribute to the free charge generation, or in 
about 10 % of the events, a Si K-shell X-ray. This Si K-shell 
X-ray will propagate in the detector and in most cases will be 
undergo photoelectric absorption with the L-shell, ejecting 
</p>
<p>another photoelectron and further contributing to the charge 
generation. However, in a small number of events, as illus-
trated schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;16.4, the Si K-shell X-ray will 
escape from the detector, carrying with it 1.740&nbsp;keV (for a Si 
K-L
</p>
<p>3
 X-ray) and robbing the original photon being captured 
</p>
<p>of this amount of energy, which creates an artifact peak at an 
energy corresponding to:
</p>
<p>Escapepeak energy =Parent peak energy 1.740keV&minus;
 
</p>
<p>(16.3)
</p>
<p>Si-escape peaks are illustrated for tin and gold in . Fig.&nbsp;16.5. 
The intensity ratio of the Si-escape peak/parent peak depends 
on the energy of the parent photon, with a maximum value 
for this ratio occurring for photon energies just above the Si 
K-shell ionization energy (1.838&nbsp;keV) and decreasing as the 
photon energy increases. It is important to identify Si-escape 
peaks so that they are not mistaken for elements present at 
minor or trace levels.
</p>
<p>16.1.3  Minor Artifacts: Coincidence Peaks
</p>
<p>Although the EDS spectrum appears to an observer to accu-
mulate simultaneously at all energies, the EDS system is in fact 
only capable of processing one photon at a time, with a duty 
cycle that ranges from 200&nbsp; ns to several microseconds, 
depending on the particular EDS.&nbsp;If a second photon should 
enter the detector during this measurement period, the pho-
ton energies would be added together, producing an artifact 
known as a &ldquo;coincidence peak&rdquo; or a &ldquo;sum peak,&rdquo; as illustrated 
schematically in . Fig.&nbsp; 16.6. An &ldquo;anti-coincidence function&rdquo; 
or &ldquo;fast discriminator&rdquo; is incorporated in the signal processing

<p>chain to suppress this effect by rejecting the measurement of 
both photons, but as the flux of X-rays increases, an increasing 
frequency of events will occur in which the time separation 
between the two events is too short for the anti-coincidence 
function to recognize and reject the separate photons, result-
ing in an artifact sum photon. This coincidence phenomenon 
can occur between any two photons, for example, two charac-
teristic X-rays, a characteristic X-ray plus a continuum X-ray, 
or two continuum X-rays. Coincidence produces a readily 
recognizable artifact peak when coincidence occurs between 
two photon energies that are particularly abundant, which is 
the case for high intensity characteristic X-ray peaks. An 
example is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.7, where two Al K-L
</p>
<p>3
 photons 
</p>
<p>(1.487&nbsp; keV) combine to produce a coincidence peak at 
2.972&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;Coincidence events can be formed from any two 
characteristic peaks, for example, O K-L + Si K-L
</p>
<p>2
. It is impor-
</p>
<p>tant to identify coincidence peaks so that they are not mis-
taken for characteristic peaks of elements present at minor or 
trace levels. Coincidence events involving lower energy pho-
tons will occur above the Duane&ndash;Hunt high energy limit 
</p>
<p>(which corresponds to the incident beam energy, E
0
) and 
</p>
<p>should not be mistaken for the true limit.

<p>16.1.4  Minor Artifacts: Si Absorption Edge 
and&nbsp;Si Internal Fluorescence Peak
</p>
<p>X-rays entering the EDS must pass through a window, typi-
cally a thin polymer, which is often supported on an etched 
silicon grid. Some X-rays will be absorbed in this grid silicon, 
especially those whose photon energy is just above the Si 
K-ionization energy (1.839&nbsp;keV). In addition, there is a thin 
inactive Si layer (&ldquo;dead-layer&rdquo;) just below the entrance elec-
trode of the EDS that also acts to absorb X-rays. The X-ray 
mass absorption coefficient of silicon increases abruptly at the 
K-shell ionization energy, and this has the effect of increasing 
the absorption of the X-ray continuum, producing an abrupt 
step. However, the EDS resolution function acts to broaden all 
photon energies so that this sharp feature is also broadened, as 
seen in . Fig.&nbsp;16.8 (after peak fitting for Si) and made into a

<p>peak-like structure. The absorption of X-rays by the Si grid 
and Si dead-layer ionizes Si atoms and subsequently results in 
the emission of Si K-shell X-rays, which contribute a false Si 
peak to the spectrum. In the example for a copper target 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.8, the apparent level of Si contributed by 
the internal fluorescence artifact is approximately 0.002 mass 
fraction.

<p>16.2  &ldquo;Best Practices&rdquo; for&nbsp;Electron-Excited 
EDS Operation
</p>
<p>While modern EDS systems are well supported by computer 
automation, there remain parameters whose selection is the 
responsibility of the user.
</p>
<p>16.2.1  Operation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;EDS System
</p>
<p>Before commencing any EDS microanalysis campaign, the 
analyst should follow an established checklist with careful 
attention to the measurement science of EDS operation. To 
establish the basis for quantitative analysis, the EDS param-
eters must be chosen consistently, especially if the analyst 
wishes to use archived spectra to serve as standards.
</p>
<p> Choosing the&nbsp;EDS Time Constant (Resolution 
and&nbsp;Throughput)
</p>
<p>The EDS amplifier time constant (a generic term which may be 
locally known as &ldquo;shaping time,&rdquo; &ldquo;processing time,&rdquo; &ldquo;resolu-
tion,&rdquo; &ldquo;count rate range,&rdquo; &ldquo;1&ndash;6,&rdquo; etc.) should be checked. There 
are usually at least two settings, one that optimizes resolution

</p>
<p>(at the cost of X-ray throughput) and one that optimizes 
throughput (at the cost of resolution). Confirming the desired 
choice of the time constant is critical for consistent recording 
of spectra, especially if the analyst is using archived spectra to 
serve as standards for quantitative analysis. This is especially 
important when the EDS system is in a multi-user environ-
ment, since the previous user may have altered this parameter.
</p>
<p> Channel Width and&nbsp;Number
</p>
<p>The energy width of the histogram bins is typically chosen as 
5, 10, or 20&nbsp;eV.&nbsp;The bin energy width determines how many 
bins will define an X-ray peak. Since the peak width is a func-
tion of photon energy, as described by Eq. (16.2), decreasing 
from approximately 129&nbsp; eV at Mn K-L3 (5.895&nbsp; keV) to 
approximately 50&nbsp;eV FWHM for C K-L
</p>
<p>2
 (0.282&nbsp;keV), a selec-
</p>
<p>tion of a 5-eV bin width is a useful choice to optimize peak 
fitting since this choice will provide 10 channels across C 
K-L
</p>
<p>2
. The number of bins that comprise the spectrum multi-
</p>
<p>plied by the bin width gives the energy span. It is useful to 
capture the complete energy spectrum from a threshold of 
0.1&nbsp; keV to the incident beam energy, E
</p>
<p>0
. Thus, to span 
</p>
<p>0&ndash;20&nbsp;keV with 5&nbsp;eV bins requires 4096 channels.
</p>
<p> Choosing the&nbsp;Solid Angle of&nbsp;the&nbsp;EDS
</p>
<p>The solid angle Ω of a detector with an active area A at a dis-
tance r from the specimen is
</p>
<p>W = / 2A r
 
</p>
<p>(16.4)
</p>
<p>If the EDS is mounted on a translatable slide that can alter the 
detector-to-specimen distance, then the user must select a 
specific value for this distance for consistency with archived 
standard spectra if these are to be used in quantitative analy-
sis procedures. Because of the exponent on the distance 
parameter r in Eq. (16.4), a small error in r propagates to a 
much larger error in the solid angle and a proportional devia-
tion in the measured intensity.
</p>
<p> Selecting a&nbsp;Beam Current for&nbsp;an&nbsp;Acceptable 
Level of&nbsp;System Dead-Time
</p>
<p>X-rays are generated randomly in time with an average rate 
determined by the flux of electrons striking the specimen, 
thus scaling with the incident beam current. As discussed 
above, the EDS system can measure only one X-ray photon at 
a time, so that it is effectively unavailable if another photon 
arrives while the system is &ldquo;busy&rdquo; measuring the first photon. 
Depending on the separation in the time of arrival of the sec-
ond photon, the anti-coincidence function will exclude the 
second photon, but if the measurement of the first photon is 
not sufficiently advanced, both photons will be excluded 
from the measurement and effectively lost. Due to this pho-
ton loss, the output count rate (OCR) in counts/second of the 
detector will always be less than the input count rate (ICR). 
The relation between the OCR and ICR is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.9 
for a four-detector SDD-EDS.&nbsp;An automatic correction func-
tion measures the time increments when the detector is busy 
processing photons, and to compensate for possible photon 
loss during this &ldquo;dead-time,&rdquo; additional time is added at the 
conclusion of the user-specified measurement time so that all

<p>measurements are made on the basis of the same &ldquo;live-time&rdquo; 
so as to achieve constant dose for quantitative measurements. 
The level of activity of the EDS is reported to the user as a 
percentage &ldquo;dead-time&rdquo;:
</p>
<p>Deadtime % = ICR OCR / ICR 100%( ) ( ) &times;&minus;  (16.5)
</p>
<p>Dead-time increases as the beam current increases. The 
dead time correction circuit can correct the measurement 
</p>
<p>time over the full dead-time range to 80 % or higher. (Note 
that as a component of a quality measurement system, the 
dead-time correction function should be periodically 
checked by systematically changing the beam current and 
comparing the measured X-ray intensity with predicted.) 
However, as the dead-time increases and the arrival rate of 
X-rays at the EDS increases, coincidence events become 
progressively more prominent. This effect is illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp;16.10 for a sequence of spectra from a glass with six

<p>major constituents (O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Fe) measured at 
increasing dead-time. The spectra show the in-growth of a 
series of coincidence peaks as the dead-time increases. With 
the long pulses of the Si(Li) EDS technology, the pulse 
inspection function was effective in minimizing coincidence 
effects to dead-times in the range 20&ndash;30 %. There is more 
vendor-to-vendor variability in SDD-EDS technology. Some 
vendors provide coincidence detection that will permit 
dead- times of up to 50 %, while others are restricted to 10 % 
dead- time. Since there is variability among vendors&rsquo; SDD 
performance, it is useful to perform a measurement to deter-
mine the performance characteristic of each detector. See 
the sidebar for a procedure implementing such a procedure. 
Regardless of dead-time restrictions, an SDD-EDS is still a 
factor of 10 or more faster than an Si(Li)-EDS for the same 
resolution. In summary, as a critical step in establishing a 
quality measurement strategy, the beam current (for a spe-
cific EDS solid angle) should be selected to produce an 
acceptable rate of coincidence events in the worst-case sce-
nario. This beam current can then be used for all measure-
ments with reasonable expectation that the dead-time will 
be within acceptable limits.

<p>Current and Dead-Time
</p>
<p>Aluminum produces one of the highest fluxes of X-rays per 
unit probe current: With the Al K-shell ionization energy of 
1.559&nbsp;keV, a modest beam energy of 15&nbsp;keV provides an over-
voltage of 9.6 for strong excitation. Al K-L
</p>
<p>2
 is of sufficient 
</p>
<p>energy (1.487&nbsp;keV) that it has low self-absorption, and at this 
energy the SDD efficiency is also relatively high. The Al K-L
</p>
<p>2
 
</p>
<p>energy is low enough that this peak is also quite susceptible 
to coincidence events. Pure aluminum thus makes an ideal 
sample for testing the coincidence detection performance of 
a detector and for determining the maximum practical probe 
current for a given beam energy.
 1. Place a mounted, flat, polished sample of pure Al in the 
</p>
<p>SEM chamber at optimal analytical working distance.
 2. Mount a Faraday cup with a picoammeter in the SEM 
</p>
<p>chamber.
 3. Configure the detector at the desired process time.
 4. Configure the SEM at the desired beam energy and an 
</p>
<p>initial probe current. Measure the probe current using 
the Faraday cup/picoammeter.
</p>
<p> 5. Collect a spectrum from the pure Al sample with at 
least 10,000 counts in the Al K peak.
</p>
<p> 6. Use your vendor&rsquo;s software (or NIST DTSA-II) to 
integrate the background-corrected intensity in the Al 
K peak (E = 1.486&nbsp;keV).
</p>
<p> 7. Use your vendor&rsquo;s software (or NIST DTSA-II) to look 
for and integrate the background-corrected intensity in 
the Al K + Al K coincidence peak (E = 2.972&nbsp;keV).
</p>
<p> 8. Determine the ratio of the integrated intensity I(Al 
K + Al K)/I(Al K). We desire this ratio to be smaller 
than 0.01 (1 %). In some trace analysis situations, it may 
desirable to have this ratio less than 0.001 (0.1 %). 
Setting this limit too low will limit throughput but 
</p>
<p>setting it too high may make trace element analysis 
challenging.
</p>
<p> 9. If the ratio is too large, decrease the probe current and 
re-measure the probe current and the Al spectrum. 
Re-measure the ratio I(Al K + Al K)/I(Al K).
</p>
<p> 10. Repeat steps 5&ndash;10 until a suitable probe current has 
been determine.
</p>
<p> 11. Finally, note the suitable probe current and use it 
consistently at the beam energy for which it was 
determined.

<p>16.3  Practical Aspects of&nbsp;Ensuring EDS 
Performance for&nbsp;a&nbsp;Quality 
Measurement Environment
</p>
<p>The modern energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer is an 
amazing device capable of measuring the energy of tens of 
thousands of X-ray events per second. The spectra can be 
processed to extract measures of composition with a preci-
sion of a fraction of a weight-percent. However, this poten-
tial will not be realized if the detector is not performing 
optimally. It is important to ensure that the detector is 
mounted and configured optimally each time it is used. 
Some parameters change infrequently and need only be 
checked when a significant modification is made to the 
detector or the SEM.&nbsp; Other parameters and performance 
metrics can change from day-to-day and need to be verified 
more frequently. The following sections will step through a 
series of tests in a rationally ordered progression. The initial 
tests and configuration steps need only be performed occa-
sionally, for example, when the detector is first commis-
sioned or when a significant service event has occurred. 
Later steps, like ensuring proper calibration, should be per-
formed regularly and a archival record of the results 
maintained.
</p>
<p>16.3.1  Detector Geometry
</p>
<p>In most electron-beam instruments, the EDS detector is 
mounted on a fixed flange to ensure a consistent sample/
detector geometry with a fixed elevation angle. Almost all 
modern EDS detectors are mounted in a tubular snout with 
the crystal mounted at the end of the snout and the face of 
the active detector element perpendicular to the principle 
axis of the snout. The principal axis of the snout is oriented in 
the instrument such that it intersects with the electron beam 
axis at the &ldquo;optimal working distance.&rdquo; This geometry is illus-
trated in . Fig.&nbsp;16.11.
</p>
<p>Often the detector is mounted on the flange on a sliding 
mechanism that allows the position of the detector to trans-
late (move in and out) along the axis of the snout. The eleva-
tion angle is nominally held fixed during the translation but 
the distance from the detector crystal changes and along with 
it the solid angle (Ω) subtended by the detector. The solid

away from the sample is designed to decrease the solid angle 
but does not change the elevation angle or the optimal work-
ing distance.

<p>It is important to be able to maintain a reproducible solid 
angle through consistent repositioning of the detector. Some 
slide mechanisms are motorized. Motorized mechanisms 
should define an &ldquo;inserted&rdquo; position and a &ldquo;retracted&rdquo;

<p>position, which you should test to ensure that the positioning 
is reproducible between insertions. Manual mechanisms usu-
ally provide a threaded screw with a manual crank to pull the 
detector in and out. The threaded screw will usually have a 
pair of interlocking nuts which can be positioned to define a 
consistent insertion position. The procedure in the sidebar 
below will allow you to set and maintain a constant solid 
angle and thus also a consistent detector collection efficiency.

</p>
<p>Distance to Maintain Solid Angle
</p>
<p> 1. Locate the pair of lock nuts on the screw mechanism. 
Move the lock nuts to the inner most position on the 
treaded rod.
</p>
<p> 2. Insert the detector as close to the sample as possible. 
Ensure that the detector does not touch the interior 
of the microscope. The detector snout must be 
electrically isolated (no conductive path) from the 
interior of the chamber to eliminate noise caused by 
electrical ground loops.
</p>
<p> 3. Twist the upper lock nut to limit the motion of the 
detector towards the sample. Tighten the lower nut 
to lock the upper nut into position.
</p>
<p> 4. Test the reproducibility of the insertion point by 
extracting and inserting the detector and collecting a 
series of spectra. If the characteristic peak intensities 
are reproducible (to much better than a fraction of a 
percent) between insertions, the precision is adequate.
</p>
<p>The take-off angle is the angle at which X-rays exit a flat sam-
ple in the direction of the detector. For a flat sample mounted 
perpendicular to the electron beam at the optimal working 
distance, the take-off angle equals the elevation angle. If the 
sample is tilted or the sample surface is at a slightly different 
working distance, then the take-off angle can be computed 
from the sample tilt, the working distance and the sample-to-
detector distance. This is shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 16.13. Often you 
will hear the terms elevation angle and take-off angle used 
interchangeably. It is more precise however to think of the 
elevation angle as being a fixed property of the instrument/
detector geometry and the take-off angle being dependent 
upon instrument-specimen configuration.
</p>

<p>correction. The elevation angle (usually sloppily called the 
&ldquo;take-off angle&rdquo;) is often a configuration option that may be 
available to you to modify or may require a service engineer. 
Usually you can check the elevation angle by opening a spec-
trum data file in a text editor. Most spectrum files are ASCII 
text files and the vendors write a line containing the elevation 
or nominal take-off angle.
</p>
<p>Compare the value produced by the software with the 
physical position of your detector relative to the beam axis. 
Sometimes, the correct instrument specific value of the take- 
off angle will be handwritten in the EDS vendor&rsquo;s documenta-
tion. Other times, you can extract the angle from instrument 
specific schematic diagrams from the SEM or EDS vendors. 
Regardless, it is a good idea to verify the elevation angle using 
a protractor or a smart phone. Many smart phones contain 
inclinometers which are accurate to within a degree and &ldquo;bub-
ble level apps&rdquo; are available to turn the phone into a digital 
inclinometer. First, test the accuracy of the cell phone incli-
nometer using a 30-60-90 triangle or similar reference shape. 
Then use the cell phone to measure the angle of the snout rela-
tive to the angle of the column and calculate the elevation 
angle. . Figure&nbsp; 16.14 shows that a cell phone measures the 
elevation angle of this detector to within half a degree (90&deg;&ndash;
54.5&deg; = 35.5&deg; ~ 35&deg; nominal value). Achieving similar accu-
racy with a protractor and a bubble level is difficult.
</p>
<p>16.3.2  Process Time
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;process time&rdquo; (also called the &ldquo;throughput setting,&rdquo; 
the &ldquo;detector time constant,&rdquo; the &ldquo;resolution setting&rdquo; or 
other names) determines how much time the detector elec-
tronics dedicates to processing each incoming X-ray. A 
longer &ldquo;process time&rdquo; tends to produce lower X-ray 
throughput but higher spectral resolution. Shorter &ldquo;pro-
cess times&rdquo; tend to produce higher X-ray throughput but 
lower spectral resolution. By throughput, we mean the 
maximum number of X-rays that the detector can measure 
</p>
<p>per unit time. By spectral resolution we mean the width of 
a characteristic peak, usually taken to be the Mn K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 
</p>
<p>(Kα) peak.
Higher throughput is desirable because it allows you to 
</p>
<p>use higher probe currents to produce more X-rays and pro-
duce measured spectra with a larger number of measured 
X-rays. Higher resolution is desirable because it becomes 
easier to distinguish characteristic peaks of similar energy. 
Both are virtues but one is achieved at the expense of the 
other.
</p>
<p>The task of selecting a process time is the task of balanc-
ing good throughput with adequate resolution. At the best 
resolution settings, throughput is seriously compromised 
and as a result the precision of quantitative analysis is also 
compromised. At the highest throughput settings, resolution 
is compromised and it becomes much more difficult to dis-
tinguish interfering peaks.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, resolution degrades relatively slowly while 
throughput increases quickly. Moderate pulse process times 
tend to degrade the ultimate resolution by a few percent, 
while increasing throughput by much larger factors. Every 
vendor is different but typically a moderate pulse process 
time will produce both adequate resolution and excellent 
throughput.
</p>
<p>While some modern SDD are capable of ultimate resolu-
tions of 122&ndash;128 eV, compromising the resolution to 130&ndash;
135&nbsp; eV will produce an excellent compromise between 
resolution and throughput. Even a resolution of 140&ndash;150&nbsp;eV 
at high throughputs can produce excellent quantitative 
results because the precision of spectrum fitting is more 
determined by the number of measured X-rays than the 
spectral resolution.
</p>
<p> z Check 2: Selecting a Process Time
</p>
<p> 5 Ensure that your EDS detector electronics are set to a 
moderate process time that produces a good 
throughput with a resolution within 5&nbsp;eV of the best 
resolution. Record this parameter in your electronic 
notebook for future reference.
</p>
<p> 5 Do not use an &ldquo;adaptive process time&rdquo; for 
standards-based quantitative analysis. Adaptive 
process times allow the resolution to change with 
throughput making spectrum fitting challenging and 
less accurate.
</p>
<p>The optimization of throughput is also confounded by an 
another practical limitation&mdash;coincident X-rays or pulse- 
pileup&mdash;and will be addressed in a later section.
</p>
<p>16.3.3  Optimal Working Distance
</p>
<p>Nominally, the optimal working distance should be specified 
in instrument schematics. However, it is worth checking 
because it may vary slightly or there may be a mistake in 
</p>

</p>
<p>design or manufacturing. From the detector geometry sec-
tion, we know that the optimal working distance is the dis-
tance at which the axis along the detector snout intersects 
with the electron beam axis (see . Fig.&nbsp;16.13). This working 
distance should also produce the largest flux of X-rays and be 
the distance which is least sensitive to slight errors in vertical 
positioning.
</p>
<p> z Check 3: Measuring the Optimal Working Distance
</p>
<p> 1. Select a sample like a piece of copper and mount it 
perpendicular to the electron beam axis.
</p>
<p> 2. Select a beam energy of 15&ndash;25&nbsp;keV and a moderate 
probe current to produce ~ 20% dead time.
</p>
<p> 3. Move the stage&rsquo;s vertical axis to place the sample 
close to the objective lens pole piece. Be careful not 
to run the sample into a detector.
</p>
<p> 4. Focus the image and record the working distance 
reported by your SEM&rsquo;s software.
</p>
<p> 5. Collect a 60 live-time second spectrum.
 6. Move the stage away from the objective lens pole 
</p>
<p>piece in 1-mm steps.
 7. Repeat steps 4&ndash;6, taking the working distance 
</p>
<p>through the nominal optimal working distance.
 8. Process the spectra. Extract the total number of 
</p>
<p>counts in the energy range from about 100&nbsp;eV to the 
beam energy and plot this number against the 
working distance.
</p>
<p> 9. Determine the working distance which produces the 
largest number of counts. Since this working distance 
represents an inflection point, the slope will be 
minimum and thus the sensitivity with respect to 
working distance will also be minimized.
</p>
<p>16.3.4  Detector Orientation
</p>
<p>In the previous section, we assumed that the principal axis of 
the detector snout is oriented to intersect with the electron 
beam axis. In other words, the detector points towards the 
sample. It is usually the EDS vendor&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure 
that the mounting flange has been designed to correctly ori-
ent and position the detector. The next check will verify this.
</p>
<p>The active face of an EDS detector is a planar area that is 
mounted perpendicular to the snout axis. In front of the 
</p>
<p>detector element there is usually a window and an electron 
trap. Most windows are ultrathin layers of polymer or sili-
con nitride mounted on a grid for mechanical strength. 
Examples of two support grids are given in . Fig.&nbsp; 16.15. 
While the grid may have an open area fraction of 75&ndash;80 %, 
the silicon or carbon grid bars are often very thick 
(0.38&nbsp;mm) to enhance mechanical rigidity under the strain 
of up to one atmosphere of differential pressure. Off-axis 
the grid bars can occlude the direct transmission of X-rays 
from the sample to the detector element. Furthermore, the 
magnetic electron trap can also occlude X-rays from off-
axis. As a result, an EDS detector is more sensitive to X-rays 
produced on the snout axis than slightly off the axis. The 
result is a position dependent efficiency which peaks on 
axis and decreases as the source of the X-rays is further 
from axis.
</p>
<p>A wide field-of-view X-ray spectrum image can demon-
strate the position sensitivity and can be used to ensure that 
the detector snout and detector active element are oriented 
correctly.
</p>
<p> z Check 4: Collect a Wide Field X-ray Spectrum Image
</p>
<p> 1. Mount a flat, polished piece of Cu in your SEM.
 2. Image the Cu at the optimal working distance and at 
</p>
<p>20&ndash;25&nbsp;keV to excite both the K and L lines.
 3. Find out how wide a field-of-view your SEM can 
</p>
<p>image at the optimal working distance. The example 
in . Fig.&nbsp;16.16 uses a 4-mm field-of-view.
</p>
<p> 4. Collect a high count X-ray spectrum image from the 
Cu. Acquiring at a moderate-to-high probe current 
for an hour or more at 256&nbsp;&times; 256-pixel image 
dimensions should produce sufficiently high 
signal-to-noise data.
</p>
<p> 5. Process the data to extract and plot the raw 
intensities at each pixel in each of the Cu K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 and 
</p>
<p>Cu L-family lines.
 1. It is important to extract the raw intensities and 
</p>
<p>not the normalized intensities since we are 
looking for variation in the raw intensity as a 
function of position.

<p> 2. The open source software ImageJ-Fiji (ImageJ 
plus additional tools) can be used to process 
spectrum image data if it can be converted to a

<p> 6. Plot the data to demonstrate the variation of the 
intensity as a function of position. . Figure&nbsp;16.16 
shows the map from a well-oriented detector plotted 
using a thermal color scheme in which red 
represents the highest intensity and blue represents 
zero intensity. . Figure&nbsp;16.17 shows traverses 
extracted from the . Fig.&nbsp;16.16 data on diagonals 
representing parallel to the detector axis and 
perpendicular to the detector axis. Verify that the 
most intense region in the intensity plots is in the 
center of the image area.
</p>
<p> 7. Note the extent of the region of uniform efficiency. 
Variation from ideal uniform sensitivity has 
consequences.
 1. Low magnification X-ray spectrum images will 
</p>
<p>suffer from reduced intensity towards the edges.
 2. Point mode X-ray spectrum acquisitions collected 
</p>
<p>off the optical axis will also suffer from dimi-
</p>
<p>nished intensities leading to low analytical totals 
and sub-optimal quantitative results.
</p>
<p> 3. Typically, the Cu L-family peak is more sensi tive 
due to absorption by the vacuum window support 
grid&rsquo;s Si ribs. . Figure&nbsp;16.15 (source: Moxtek) 
shows the design of two recent Moxtek&nbsp;support 
grids. The vertical sensitivity is usually minimized 
by orienting the grid ribs vertically.

<p> z Sidebar: Processing a &ldquo;RAW&rdquo; Spectrum Image with 
</p>
<p>ImageJ-Fiji
</p>
<p> 1. Convert the X-ray spectrum image data into a RAW 
file. A RAW file is large binary representation of the 
data in the spectrum image. Each pixel in the 
spectrum image consists of a spectrum encode in an 
integer binary format. The pixels are organized in a 
continuous array row-by- row. The size of the file is 
typically equal to (channel depth) &times; (row 
dimension) &times; (column dimensions) &times; (2 or 4 bytes 
per integer value).
</p>
<p> 2. Import the RAW data file into ImageJ using the 
&ldquo;Import &rarr; Raw&rdquo; tools to create a &ldquo;stack&rdquo; as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;16.18.
</p>
<p> 3. As imported, the orientation of the stack will depend 
upon how the data in the RAW file is organized. 
Regardless of the original orientation, you will need to 
pivot the data a couple times using the &ldquo;Image &rarr;

</p>
<p>16.3.5  Count Rate Linearity
</p>
<p>One of the most important circuits in an X-ray pulse proces-
sor accounts for the time during which the pulse processor is 
busy processing X-ray events. When the pulse processor is 
processing an X-ray, it is unavailable to process new incoming 
X-rays. This time is called &ldquo;dead-time.&rdquo; In contrast, the time 
during which the processor is not busy and is available is called 
&ldquo;live-time.&rdquo; The sum of &ldquo;live-time&rdquo; and &ldquo;dead-time&rdquo; is called 
&ldquo;real-time&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; the time you would measure using a wall clock.
</p>
<p>For calculating the effective probe dose, live-time is the 
critical parameter. The effective probe dose consists of those 
electrons which could produce measurable X-rays. So the 
effective probe dose equals the live-time times the probe cur-
rent. The effective probe dose is always less than the real 
probe dose, which is the product of the real time and the

</p>
<p>probe current, due to the loss of useful electrons during the 
dead-time.
</p>
<p>It is very important for accurate quantitative analysis that 
the measured X-ray intensity is linear with respect to the 
effective probe dose. Twice the effective probe dose should 
produce twice the measured intensity. Not only is this 
</p>
<p>important because it is often hard to replicate the identical 
probe current but it is also important because different mate-
rials measured with the same probe current will produce dif-
ferent dead times.
</p>
<p>There really is no excuse for a modern X-ray detector not 
to be linear. However, it is worth checking because the test 
can expose other potential problems like a non-linear or off-
set probe current meter.

<p>Procedure:
 1.  Mount the Faraday cup and the polished copper

<p>sample on the stage at the same nominal working 
distance.
</p>
<p> 2.  Image the sample at the optimal working distance 
and a beam energy selected in the 15&ndash;25&nbsp;keV 
range.
</p>

current. Measure and record the probe current using the 
Faraday cup and the picoammeter.
</p>
<p>4. Collect a 60 live-time second spectrum from the copper 
sample.
</p>
<p>5. Increase the probe current through a sequence of 
approximately 10&ndash;20 steps from the initial probe current 
to approximately 2 times the optimal probe current. 
Collect a 60 live-time second spectrum at each probe 
current and measure and record the probe current using 
the Faraday cup. A plot of such a measurement sequence 
is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.23 (upper).

</p>
<p>(You don&rsquo;t need to background correct the integral.) Plot 
the measured intensity divided by the probe current 
against the measured probe current. The result should 
be a horizontal line, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.23 (lower).
1. If the line is not horizontal, the problem may be in the 
</p>
<p>detector or in the probe current measurement.
2. The probe current measurement could be non-linear 
</p>
<p>meaning the plot of the measured probe current to 
true probe current is not a straight line.
</p>
<p>3. Alternatively, the probe current may have a zero 
offset. The zero offset can be measured by blanking 
the beam and recording the measured current at zero 
true current. Subsequent probe current measurement 
can be offset by this value.

</p>
<p>use this value for all your data acquisition. Before each day&rsquo;s 
measurements ensure that the detector is calibrated consis-
tently by following the same protocol to check and, if neces-
sary, recalibrate your detector.
</p>
<p>On a modern pulse processor, calibration is usually per-
formed using the EDS vendor&rsquo;s software. The software will 
prompt you to collect a spectrum from an established mate-
rial. The software will examine the spectrum and extract the 
positions of various characteristic X-ray features. The soft-
ware will then perform an internal adjustment to center these 
features in the correct channels. Most modern pulse proces-
sors perform a continuous zero offset calibration using a 
&ldquo;zero strobe pulse&rdquo; the pulse processor adds to the signal 
stream for diagnostic purposes. Thus the only parameter 
they usually adjust when performing a calibration is an elec-
tronic gain. Usually, this involves identifying a single high 
energy characteristic line (like the Mn K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 or the Cu K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
) 
</p>
<p>and adjusting the gain until this feature is centered on the 
appropriate channel. The calibration is thus a two-point cali-
bration&mdash;either a low energy characteristic line or the zero 
strobe at low energy and a second characteristic line at high 
</p>
<p>energy. Two points are sufficient to unambiguously calibrate 
a linear function. The calibration (peak position) and resolu-
tion (peak shape) should be constant with input count rate 
(or dead-time), as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.24.
</p>
<p>To a very high degree, modern EDS detectors are linear. 
However if you look carefully in the mid-range of energies, 
you many notice the KLM markers may be misaligned by a 
channel or two. This is evidence that your detector is not per-
fectly linear but this need not represent a true performance 
problem.
</p>
<p>Since energy calibration is so critical but is also one of 
many parameters that should be measured as part of a com-
plete EDS Quality Control (QC) program, the validation will 
be discussed in a later section.

</p>
<p>Usually, the window is coated with a thin layer of aluminum 
(or other metal) to keep light in the chamber from creating a 
spurious signal on the EDS detector.
</p>
<p>Regardless, it is worthwhile to test whether your detector 
is sensitive to light. You may be surprised by a pinhole light 
leak or a window without an adequate opaque layer.
</p>
<p> z Check 6: Check for SEM Light Sources
</p>
<p>The windows on some EDS detectors are not opaque to light 
and light in the chamber will produce noise counts particu-
larly in low channels.
 1.  Enumerate the potential sources of light inside your 
</p>
<p>SEM.&nbsp;Sources to consider:
 1. An IR camera
 2. Stage position sensors
 3. The tungsten filament (essentially a light bulb)
 4. Chamber windows
 5. Cathodoluminescence from samples like zinc 
</p>
<p>selenide or benitoite.
 2.  Collect a series of spectra and examine these spectra for 
</p>
<p>anomalies.
 1. When possible collect the spectra without an electron 
</p>
<p>beam so there should be no source of X-rays.
 2. Collect a spectrum with the light source turned off 
</p>
<p>and a spectrum with the source on. There should be 
no difference.
</p>
<p>16.3.8  Setting Up&nbsp;a&nbsp;Quality Control Program
</p>
<p>An ongoing QC program is a valuable way to demonstrate 
that your data and results can be trusted&mdash;&mdash;yesterday, today, 
and tomorrow. If a client ever questions some data, it is useful 
to be able to go back to the day that data was collected and 
show that your instrument and detector were performing 
adequately. A well-designed QC program need not take 
much time. A single spectrum from a consistent sample col-
lected under consistent conditions is sufficient to identify 
most common failure modes and to document the long-term 
performance of your detector. A well-designed QC program 
is likely to save time by eliminating the possibility of collect-
ing data when the detector is miscalibrated or otherwise 
misbehaving.
</p>
<p> z Check 7: Implement a Quick QC Program
</p>
<p> 1. Maintain a sample consisting of a Faraday cup and a 
piece of Cu or Mn. Make use of this sample each day 
on which you intend on collecting quantitative EDS 
data to ensure that the detector is calibrated.
</p>
<p> 2.  Image the sample at a consistent working distance 
(the &ldquo;optimal working distance&rdquo;), a consistent beam 
energy, and a consistent probe current.
</p>
<p> 3. Collect a spectrum from a sample for a consistent 
live-time.

</p>
<p> Using the&nbsp;QC Tools Within DTSA-II
</p>
<p>While it is possible to implement a QC program by combining 
an EDS vendor&rsquo;s software with careful record-keeping, 
DTSA-II provides tools specifically designed to implement a 
basic EDS detector QC program. The tools import spectra, 
make some basic sanity checks, process the spectrum to extract 
QC metrics, archive the metrics and report the metrics.
</p>
<p> Creating a&nbsp;QC Project
</p>
<p> 5 A QC project is an archive of spectra collected from a 
specified sample under similar conditions on a specified 
detector/instrument. The spectra are fitted with a 
modeled spectrum and the resulting quantities 
recorded to track these values over the lifetime of the 
detector.
</p>
<p> 5 Creating a QC Project involves specifying a detector 
and the conditions which are to be held consistent 
(. Fig.&nbsp;16.25). If you use a single detector with different 
process times, either select a constant process time or, 
better yet, create individual projects for each process 
time.
</p>
<p> 5 The material may be simple or complex but 
should&nbsp;be robust, durable and provide characteristic 
lines over a large range of energies. Copper is 
</p>
<p>ideal&nbsp;because it is readily available, stable and has 
both K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 (~8.04&nbsp;keV) and L-family (~930&nbsp;eV) 
</p>
<p>lines.
 5 The beam energy should be sufficient to adequately 
excite (overvoltage &gt; 2) all the lines of interest in the 
sample.
</p>
<p> 5 The nominal working distance should be the 
detector&rsquo;s optimal working distance. The sample 
should be brought into focus (using the stage Z-axis if 
necessary) at this working distance before collecting a 
spectrum.
</p>
<p> 5 The nominal probe current is the probe current at 
which the spectra will be collected (to within a few 
percent). Usually, the &ldquo;use probe current 
normalization&rdquo; will be selected so that all intensities 
are scaled relative to the probe current measured with 
a in-lens cup or a Faraday cup.
</p>
<p> 5 After creating the project, you will need to go 
through&nbsp;the QC tool additional times to add measured 
spectra.
</p>
<p> z Adding Spectra to a QC Project
</p>
<p> 5 To add spectra to a QC project, you first need to 
specify which project you will be adding the spectra. 
Once you select the project, the &ldquo;material,&rdquo; &ldquo;beam 
energy,&rdquo; &ldquo;nominal working distance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;nominal 
probe current&rdquo; boxes will fill with the associated 
information (see . Fig.&nbsp;16.26).

<p>       . Fig. 16.26 Panel for selection 
</p>
<p>of detector and material parameters
</p>
<p> 5 Once the project has been selected, you will need to 
specify a spectrum to add to the project. Needless to 
say, the spectrum should have been collected on the 
correct detector under the conditions specified 
(see .  Fig. 16.27).
</p>
<p> 5 After selecting the spectrum, the spectrum will be 
processed by fitting it to a modeled spectrum shape. 
The resulting fit parameters will be reported and 
compared with the fit parameters from previous fits. 
The results are organized into columns associated 
with the current fit, the average of all fits, average of 
the first (up to) 10 fits and the average of the last (up 
to) 10 fits. Review these values to determine whether 
there has been short or long term drift in any of the 
fit parameters. The same information is shown in the 
DTSA-II Report table, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.28.
</p>
<p> 5 You can also generate reports containing these 
quantities as tabular values, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.29, 
and plotted on control charts, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;16.30.
</p>
<p> z Generating QC Reports
</p>
<p>A QC Report is a quick way to track the long-term perfor-
mance of your detector. QC Reports are also generated using 
the QC tool accessible through the &ldquo;Tools &rarr; QC Alien&rdquo; 
menu item.
</p>
<p>You will specify the detector and QC project along with 
the fit values that you wish to report. The report will be gen-
erated into a new HTML document and the result displayed 
in your system&rsquo;s default web browser. The report will look 
like . Fig.&nbsp; 16.30, with header information and a series of 
control charts. At the bottom of the report is a table contain-
ing all the data values that went into creating the control 
charts. All the values computed when the spectrum was 
added to the QC project will be available to display in the 
QC report.
</p>
<p>16.3.9  Purchasing an&nbsp;SDD
</p>
<p>If you were to survey EDS vendor&rsquo;s advertisements, you&rsquo;d 
come to conclusion that two hardware characteristics deter-
mine the &ldquo;best&rdquo; EDS detector&mdash;resolution and detector area. 
Over the last decade, detector areas have become larger and 
larger and detector resolutions have improved significantly 
too. The performance of Si(Li) detectors scaled poorly with 
size because the detector capacitance scaled with size. SDD, 
on the other hand, perform only slightly worse (throughput 
and resolution) as the detector area increases. As a result, 
even a basic modern SDD-EDS detector is larger and per-
forms better than the best Si(Li)-EDS detector of a decade 
ago.

</p>
<p>Regardless of what the EDS vendors literature tells us, 
while both of these performance characteristics are impor-
tant, neither is the basis of a well-considered choice of detec-
tor. Resolution and area are indirect proxies for the 
performance characteristics that should really drive the deci-
sion process&mdash;good throughput at an adequate resolution 
and a large solid angle of detection.
</p>
<p>First, a word or two about two characteristics which are 
absolutely required for good quantitative analysis. 
Fortunately, almost all modern SDD meet these two impor-
tant requirements&mdash;linearity and stability.
</p>
<p> Linearity of&nbsp;Output Count Rate 
with&nbsp;Live-Time&nbsp;Dose
</p>
<p>The number of X-rays measured must be proportional to the 
number of X-rays generated. If you generated ten times as 
many X-rays, you should measure ten times as many X-rays. 
Otherwise, the k-ratio, the basis of all quantitative analysis, 
would depend not only upon the composition of the material 
but also the probe current.
</p>
<p>Perform the check in section Count Rate Linearity to 
evaluate a candidate detector&rsquo;s linearity performance.
</p>
<p> Resolution and&nbsp;Peak Position Stability 
with&nbsp;Count Rate
</p>
<p>The detector resolution and peak position must not change 
appreciably with a variation of a factor of ten or more in 
X-ray flux.
</p>
<p>The same spectra used to demonstrate linearity can be used 
to demonstrate peak position and resolution stability. Use 
DTSA-II&rsquo;s calibration tool to fit the spectra and extract full 
width at half-maximum (FWHM) and channel width values for 
each spectrum. Plot the spectra and results as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;16.31.
</p>
<p>Having ensured these two basic characteristics, the 
choice of next most important characteristic depends 
upon how your detector will be used. If signal quantity is a 
problem because you are limited to low probe currents, 
STEM mode analysis of microparticles, low beam energy 
analysis, or another reason why the flux of X-rays is lim-
ited, then a detector that maximizes solid angle is impor-
tant. If on the other hand, you can produce a lot of X-rays, 
then throughput at an adequate resolution is more impor-
tant. Regardless, both criteria should be part of your eval-
uation process.

</p>
<p> Solid Angle for&nbsp;Low X-ray Flux
</p>
<p>The fraction of X-rays emitted by the sample that strike the 
detector is proportional to the solid angle. The solid angle is a 
function of both the active area of the detector and the dis-
tance from the sample to the detector. The detected fraction is 
linearly proportional to the active area of the detector but 
inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the 
sample to the detector so the position of the detector is critical. 
It is not reasonable to assume that a larger area detector will 
always produce a larger solid angle. Larger area detectors may 
require larger diameter snouts which may not be able to be 
positioned as close to the sample. Larger area detectors may 
also produce slightly poorer resolution and/or slightly lower 
ultimate throughput due to increases in &ldquo;ballistic deficit&rdquo; &mdash;
the spreading of electron packets in the active detector area.
</p>
<p>The only way to know ahead of time what solid angle you 
can expect is to ask they vendor to provide schematics show-
ing how your detector will be positioned in your instrument. 
The critical parameters are sample-to-detector distance at the 
maximum insertion position, the optimal working distance, 
the detector area, and the elevation angle. These parameters 
can be used within DTSA-II to model the X-ray signal you 
can expect to measure from the types of samples and the 
probe currents you use.
</p>
<p> Maximizing Throughput at Moderate 
Resolution
</p>
<p>Modern detectors are capable of extraordinary resolutions and 
high throughput, though not both at the same time. The best 
resolutions are achieved at long pulse process times, which pro-
duce poor ultimate throughput. The highest throughputs are 
achieved at short pulse process times; but, while it may be pos-
sible to measure many X-rays per unit time, coincidence events 
(pulse pile up) limit the quantitative accuracy. The quantitative 
</p>
<p>performance of the detector is three-way trade-off between 
throughput, resolution, and coincidence rate. Typically, this is 
accomplished by defining an acceptable coincidence rate as dis-
cussed in the section on process time and determining the pro-
cess time that maximizes the throughput at this coincidence 
rate. This process time will typically be a slight compromise 
from the one that produces the optimal resolution but typically 
not by more than a few eV FWHM at Mn K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 (Kα). A few eV 
</p>
<p>of resolution degradation is usually an acceptable compromise 
as throughput is far more important than resolution for accu-
rate quantitative EDS microanalysis.
</p>
<p> z Special Case: Low Energy Sensitivity
</p>
<p>If measuring low energy X-rays in the sub-200-eV range is 
particularly important to you, then you should focus your 
criteria on this energy region and understand that to opti-
mize this regime will likely require compromises to through-
put. Find samples similar to the ones you will commonly 
measure and use these samples to evaluate the performance 
of the candidate detectors.

<p>17.1  Getting Started With&nbsp;NIST DTSA-II
</p>
<p>17.1.1  Motivation
</p>
<p>Reading about a new subject is good but there is nothing like 
doing to reinforce understanding. With this in mind, the 
authors of this textbook have designed a number of practical 
exercises that reinforce the book&rsquo;s subject matter. Some of 
these exercises can be performed with software you have 
available to you&mdash;either instrument vendor software or a 
spreadsheet like MS Excel or LibreOffice/OpenOffice Calc. 
Other exercises require functionality which may not be pres-
ent in all instrument vendor&rsquo;s software. Regardless, it is much 
easier to explain an exercise when everyone is working with 
the same tools.
</p>
<p>To ensure that everyone has the tools necessary to perform 
the exercises, we have developed the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology software called DTSA-II (Ritchie, 
2009, 2010, 2011a, b, c, 2012, 2017a, b).&nbsp; NIST DTSA-II is 
quantitative X-ray microanalysis software designed with edu-
cation and best practices in mind. Furthermore, as an output 
of the US Federal Government, it is not subject to copyright 
restrictions and freely available to all regardless of affiliation 
or nationality. From a practical perspective, this means that 
you can install and use DTSA-II on any suitable computer. 
You can give it to colleagues or students. You can use it at 
home, in your office, or in the lab. If you are so inclined, the 
source code is available to allow you to review the implemen-
tation or to enhance the tool for your own special purposes.
</p>
<p>Exercises in the textbook will be designed around the 
capabilities of DTSA-II.&nbsp; Many will take advantage of the 
graphical user interface to manipulate and interrogate spec-
tra. A number will take advantage of the command line 
scripting interface to access low-level data or to perform 
advanced operations.
</p>
<p>17.1.2  Platform
</p>
<p>NIST DTSA-II is written in the multi-platform run-time 
environment Java. This means that the same program runs 
on Microsoft Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8.X, 10.X), Apple OS X 
10.6+, and many flavors of Linux and UNIX.&nbsp;The run-time 
environment adjusts the look-and-feel of the application to 
be consistent with the standards for each operating system. 
For Windows, Linux, and UNIX, the main menu is part of 
the main application window. In OS X, the main menu is at 
the top of the primary screen.
</p>
<p>To make installation as easy as possible on each environ-
ment, an installer has been developed which works on 
Windows, OS X, and Linux/UNIX.&nbsp;The installer verifies that 
an appropriate version of Java is available and place the exe-
cutable and data files in a location that is consistent with 
operating system guidelines. Detailed installation instruc-
tions are available on the download site.
</p>
<p>17.1.3  Overview
</p>
<p>DTSA-II was designed around common user interface meta-
phors and should feel consistent with other programs on 
your operating system. It has a main menu which provides a 
handful of high-level interactions such as file access, process-
ing, simulation, reporting, and help. Many of these menu 
items lead to &ldquo;wizard-style&rdquo; dialogs which take you step-by- 
step through some more complex operation like experiment 
design, spectrum quantification, or spectrum simulation. 
The goal is to make common operations as simple as possible.
</p>
<p>Additional tools are often available through context sen-
sitive menus. Each region on the DTSA-II main window pro-
vides different functionality. Within these regions, you are 
likely to want to perform various context sensitive opera-
tions. These operations are accesses through menus that are 
accessed by placing the mouse over the region and issuing a 
&ldquo;right-button click&rdquo; on Windows/Linux/UNIX or an Apple-
Command key + mouse click on OS X.&nbsp;The context-sensitive 
menu items may perform operations immediately, or they 
may request additional information through dialog boxes.
</p>
<p>On the main screen, the bottom half of window is three 
tabs&mdash;the Spectrum tab, the Report tab, and the Command 
tab. The spectrum tab is useful for investigating and manipu-
lating spectra. The report tab provides a record of the work 
completed during this invocation of the program. Since the 
report is in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and stored 
by date, it is possible to review old reports either in DTSA-II 
or in a standard web browser. Some operating systems will 
index HTML documents making it easy to find old designs, 
analyses or simulations.
</p>
<p>The final tab contains a command line interface. The 
command line interface implements a Python syntax script-
ing environment. Python is a popular, powerful and com-
plete scripting language. Through Python it is possible 
(though not necessarily easy) to perform anything that can 
be done through the GUI.&nbsp;It is also possible to do a lot more. 
For example, the GUI makes available some common, useful 
geometries for performing Monte Carlo simulations of spec-
trum generation. Through scripting, it is possible to simulate 
arbitrary sample and detector geometries. Some of the exam-
ples in the text will involve scripting. These scripts will be 
installed with the software so they are readily available and so 
you can use these as the basis for your own custom scripts.
</p>
<p>An important foundational concept in DTSA-II is the 
definition of an X-ray detector. The software comes with a 
&ldquo;default detector&rdquo; which represents a typical Si(Li) detector 
on a typical SEM.&nbsp;This detector will produce adequate results 
for many purposes. However, it is better and more useful if 
you create your own detector definition or definitions to 
reflect the design and performance of your detector(s) and 
SEM.&nbsp;You define your own detector using the &ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; 
dialog which is access through the &ldquo;File &rarr; Preferences&rdquo; main 
menu item. To select and activate your detector, you select it 
in the &ldquo;Default Detector&rdquo; drop down lists on the middle, left 
side of the main DTSA-II window on the &ldquo;Spectrum Tab.&rdquo;

</p>
<p>17.1.4  Design
</p>
<p>DTSA-II is, in many ways, much more like vendor software 
used to be. This has advantages and disadvantages. Over the 
years, vendors have simplified their software. They have 
removed many more advanced spectrum manipulation tools 
and they have streamlined their software to make getting an 
answer as straightforward as possible. If your goal is simply 
to collect a spectrum, press a button, and report a result, the 
vendor software is ideal. However, if you want to develop a 
more deep understanding of how spectrum analysis works, 
many vendors have buried the tools or removed them 
entirely. DTSA-II retains many of the advanced spectrum 
manipulation and interrogation tools.
</p>
<p>DTSA-II is designed with Einstein&rsquo;s suggestion about 
simplicity in mind: &ldquo;Everything should be made as simple as 
possible, but not simpler.&rdquo; DTSA-II was designed with the 
goal of making the most reliable and accurate means of quan-
tification, standards-based quantification, as simple as pos-
sible, but not simpler. When there is a choice that might 
compromise reliability or accuracy for simplicity, reliability 
and accuracy wins out.
</p>
<p>One such example is &ldquo;auto-quant.&rdquo; Most microanalysis 
software will automatically place peak markers on spectra. 
Unfortunately, these markers have time and time again 
been demonstrated to be reliable in many but far from all 
cases. Users grow dependent on auto-quant and when it 
fails they often don&rsquo;t have the experience or confidence to 
identify the failures. The consequence is that the qualitative 
and then since the qualitative results are used to produce 
quantitative results, the quantitative results are just plain 
wrong.
</p>
<p>Rather than risking being wrong, DTSA-II requires the 
user to perform manual peak identification. The process is 
more tedious and requires more understanding by the user. 
But no more understanding than is necessary to judge 
whether the vendor&rsquo;s auto-qual has worked correctly. If you 
as a user can&rsquo;t perform manual qualitative analysis reliably, 
you should not be using the vendor&rsquo;s auto-qual.
</p>
<p>17.1.5  The Three -Leg Stool: Simulation, 
Quantification and&nbsp;Experiment 
Design
</p>
<p>NIST DTSA-II is designed to tie together three tools which 
are integral to the process of performing high-quality X-ray 
microanalysis&mdash;simulation, quantification, and experiment 
design. Simulation allows you to understand the measure-
ment process for both simple measurements and more com-
plex materials and geometries. Quantification allows you to 
turn spectra into estimates of composition. Experiment 
design ties together simulation and quantification to allow 
you to develop the most accurate and reliable measurement 
protocols.
</p>
<p> Simulation
</p>
<p>Spectrum generation can be modeled either using analytical 
models or using Monte Carlo models. The difference is that 
analytical models are deterministic, they always produce the 
same output for the equivalent input, and they are less com-
putationally intensive. They are limited, however, in the 
geometries for which we know how to perform the analytical 
calculation. Monte Carlo models are based on pseudo- 
random simulation of the physics of electron interactions 
and X-ray production. Individual electron trajectories are 
traced as they meander through the sample. Interactions like 
elastic scattering off the electrons and nucleus in the sample 
are modeled. Inelastic interactions like core-shell ionization 
are also modeled. Each core shell ionization is followed by 
either an Auger electron or an X-ray photon. The trajectories 
of these can also be modeled. The resulting X-rays can be 
collected in a modeled detector and the result presented as a 
dose-correct spectrum.
</p>
<p>So, in summary, analytical models are quicker, but Montel 
Carlo models are more flexible. Regardless, in domains where 
they are both applicable, they produce similar but not identi-
cal results.
</p>
<p> Quantification
</p>
<p>Accurate, reliable quantification is the goal. Turning mea-
sured spectra into reliable estimates of material composition 
can be a challenge. Our techniques work well when we are 
careful to prepare our samples, collect our spectra, and pro-
cess the data. However, there are many pitfalls and potential 
sources of error for the novice or the overconfident.
</p>
<p>DTSA-II implements some of the most reliable algo-
rithms for spectrum quantification. First, DTSA-II assumes 
that you will be comparing your unknown spectrum to spec-
tra collected from standard materials. Standards-based 
quantification is the most accurate and reliable technique 
known. Second, DTSA-II implements robust algorithms for 
comparing peak intensities between standards and unknown. 
DTSA- II uses linear least squares fitting of background fil-
tered spectra. This algorithm is robust, accurate, and makes 
very good use of the all the information present in each 
peak. It also provides mechanism called the residual to 
determine whether the correct elements have been identified 
and fit.
</p>
<p>Fitting produces k-ratios which are the first-order esti-
mates of composition. To extract the true composition, the 
k-ratios must be scaled to account for differences in absorp-
tion, atomic number, and secondary fluorescence. DTSA-II 
implements a handful of different matrix correction algo-
rithms although users are encouraged to use the default algo-
rithm (&lsquo;XPP&rsquo; by Pouchou and Pichoir, 1991) unless they have 
a compelling reason to do otherwise.
</p>
<p> Experiment Design
</p>
<p>One thing that has long hindered people from performing 
standards-based quantification is the complexity of design-
ing an optimal standards-based measurement. The choices 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>238
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>that go into designing a good measurement are subtle. How 
does one select the optimal beam energy? How does one 
select the best materials to use as standards? How does one 
determine when a reference spectrum1 is needed in addition 
to the standard spectra? How long an acquisition is required 
to produce the desired measurement precision? What limits 
of detection can I expect to achieve? Do I want to optimize 
accuracy or simply precision? Am I interested in minimizing 
the total error budget or am I interested in optimizing the 
measurement of one (or a couple of) elements?
</p>
<p>In fact, many of these decisions are interrelated in subtle 
ways. Increasing the beam energy will often improve preci-
sion (more counts) but will reduce accuracy (more absorp-
tion). The best standard for a precision measurement is likely 
a pure element while the best standard for an accurate mea-
surement is likely a material similar to the unknown.
</p>
<p>Then we must also consider subtle interactions between 
elements. If the emission from one element falls near in 
energy to the absorption edges of another element, accu-
racy may be reduced due to complex near edge absorption 
effects. All the different considerations make the mind reel 
and intimidate all but the most confident practitioners of 
the art.
</p>
<p>DTSA-II addresses these problems through an experi-
ment design tool. The experiment design tool calculates the 
uncertainty budget for an ensemble of different alternative 
measurement protocols. It then suggests the experiment pro-
tocol which optimizes the uncertainty budget. It outlines 
which spectra need to be acquired and the doses necessary to 
achieve the user&rsquo;s desired measurement precision. This is 
then presented in the report page as a recipe that the analyst 
can taking into the laboratory.
</p>
<p>Experiment design builds upon an expert&rsquo;s understand-
ing of the quantification process and makes extensive use of 
spectrum simulation. Through spectrum simulation, 
DTSA- II can understand how peak interferences and detec-
tor performance will influence the measurement process. 
Through spectrum simulation carefully calibrated to the per-
formance of your detectors, the experiment optimizer can 
predict how much dose (probe current x time) is required. 
Often the result is good news. We often spend much too 
much time on some spectra and too little on others.
</p>
<p>17.1.6  Introduction to&nbsp;Fundamental 
Concepts
</p>
<p>For the most part, the functionality of DTSA-II will be intro-
duced along with the relevant microanalytical concept. 
However, there are a handful of concepts which provide a 
skeleton around which the rest of the program is built. It is 
necessary to understand these concepts to use the program 
effectively.
</p>
<p>1 Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t understand the difference between a 
</p>
<p>reference and a standard spectrum. This will be explained later.
</p>
<p>DTSA-II was designed around the idea of being able 
simulate what you measure. With DTSA-II, it is possible to 
simulate the full measurement process for both simple and 
complex samples. You can simulate the spectrum from an 
unknown material and from the standard materials neces-
sary to quantify the unknown spectrum. You can quantify 
the simulated spectra just like you can quantify measured 
spectra. This ability allows you to understand the measure-
ment process in ways that are simply not possible otherwise. 
It is possible to investigate how changes in sample geometry 
or contamination or coatings will influence the results. It is 
possible to visualize the electron trajectories and X-ray pro-
duction and absorption.
</p>
<p>However to do this, it is necessary to be able to model the 
sample, the physics of electron transport, atomic ionization 
and X-ray production and transport, and the detection of 
X-rays. The physics of electrons and X-rays is not perfectly 
known, but at least it doesn&rsquo;t change between one instrument 
and another. The biggest change between instruments is the 
X-ray detection process. Not all detectors are created equal.
</p>
<p>To compensate for the detection process, DTSA-II builds 
algorithmic models of X-ray detectors based on the proper-
ties of the detector. These models are then used to convert the 
simulated X-ray flux into a simulated measured spectrum. 
The better these models, the better DTSA-II is able to simu-
late and quantify spectra.
</p>
<p> Modeled Detectors (. Fig.&nbsp;17.1)
</p>
<p>To make optimal use of DTSA-II, you will need to create a 
detector model to describe each of your X-ray detectors. 
Each detector model reflects the performance of a specific 
detector in a specific instrument at a specific resolution/
throughput setting. Each physical detector should be associ-
ated with at least one detector model. A single physical detec-
tor may have more than one detector model if the detector is 
regularly operated at different resolution / throughput set-
tings.
</p>
<p>Some of the information necessary to build the detector 
model is readily available from product literature or from a 
call to the vendor. Unfortunately, some pieces of information 
are less easy to discover. Some require access to very special-
ized samples or equipment, but fortunately, accepting the 
default values won&rsquo;t overly affect utility of the simulated 
results. . Table&nbsp;17.1 identifies which values are critical and 
which are less critical.
</p>
<p>Detector models are created in the &ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; dialog 
which is accessed through the &ldquo;File &rarr; Preferences&rdquo; main 
menu item. The tree view on the left side of the dialog allows 
you to navigate through various preference pages. By default, 
a root node labeled &ldquo;Instruments and Detectors&rdquo; is created 
with a branch called &ldquo;Probe&rdquo; and a leaf node called &ldquo;Si(Li).&rdquo; 
The branch &ldquo;Probe&rdquo; reflects a very basic traditional SEM/
microprobe. The leaf &ldquo;Si(Li)&rdquo; reflects a typical lithium-drifted 
silicon detector with a ultra-thin window and a resolution of 
132&nbsp; eV at Mn Kα. You can examine the definition of this 
detector to determine which pieces of information are neces-
sary to fully describe a detector.

<p>Some pieces of information are specific to your instru-
ment and the way the detector is mounted in the instrument. 
Window-type, detector area, crystal thickness, resolution, 
gold layer thickness, aluminum layer thickness, nickel layer 
thickness, and dead layer thickness are model specific prop-
erties of the detector. Elevation angle, optimal working dis-
tance, sample-to-detector distance, and azimuthal angle are 
determined by how the detector is mounted in your instru-
ment. The energy scale, zero offset, and the resolution are 
dependent upon hardware settings that are usually config-
ured within the vendor&rsquo;s acquisition software. The oldest sys-
tems may have physical hardware switches.
</p>
<p>Window Type (. Fig.&nbsp;17.2)
</p>
<p>As is discussed elsewhere, most detectors are protected from 
contamination by an X-ray transparent window. Older win-
dows were made of ultrathin beryllium foils or occasionally 
boron-nitride or diamond films. Almost all modern detectors 
use ultrathin polymer windows although the recently intro-
duced silicon nitride (Si
</p>
<p>3
N
</p>
<p>4
) windows show great promise.
</p>
<p>Each type of window has a different efficiency as a func-
tion of energy. The largest variation in efficiency is seen below 
</p>
<p>1&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;Here the absorption edges in the elements making up 
the windows can lead to large jumps in efficiency over nar-
row energy ranges. Diamond represents an extreme example 
in which the absorption edge at 0.283&nbsp;keV leads to a three 
order-of-magnitude change in efficiency.
</p>
<p>Your vendor should be able to tell you the make and 
model of the window on your detector.
</p>
<p>The Optimal Working Distance (. Figs.&nbsp;17.3 
</p>
<p>and&nbsp;17.4)
</p>
<p>The position and orientation of your EDS detector is optimized 
for a certain sample position. Typically, the optimal sample 
position is located on the electron-beam axis at an optimal 
working distance. At this distance, the effective elevation angle 
equals the nominal elevation angle. Sometimes, the optimal 
working distance will be specified in the drawings the EDS ven-
dor used to design the detector mounting hardware (. Fig.&nbsp;17.4). 
Other times, it is necessary to estimate the optimal working 
distance finding the sample position that produces the largest 
X-ray flux. The optimal working distance is measured on the 
same scale as the focal distance since the working distance 
value recorded in spectrum files is typically this value.

<p>The difference between the effective elevation defined by 
the actual working distance and the nominal elevation as 
defined by the intersection of the detector axis and the optic 
axis. The effective elevation angle can be calculated from the 
actual working distance given the optimal working distance, 
the nominal elevation angle, and the nominal sample-to- 
detector distance.
</p>
<p>Elevation Angle
</p>
<p>The elevation angle is defined as the angle between the detec-
tor axis and the plane perpendicular to the optic axis. The 
elevation angle is a fixed property of the detector as it is 
mounted in an instrument. The elevation angle is closely 
related to the take-off angle. For a sample whose top surface 
is perpendicular to the optic axis, the take-off angle at the 
optimal working distance equals the elevation angle.
</p>
<p>Elevation angles typically range between 30&deg; and 50&deg; with 
between 35&deg; and 40&deg; being the most common. The correct 
detector elevation is important for accurate quantification as 
the matrix correction has a strong dependence on this 
parameter.
</p>
<p>Sample-to-Detector Distance
</p>
<p>The sample-to-detector distance is the distance from front face 
of the detector crystal to the intersection of the optic and detec-
tor axes. The sample-to-detector distance helps to define the 
solid angle of acceptance for the detector. The sample-to-detec-
tor distance can often be extracted from the drawings used to 
design the detector mounting hardware (See . Fig.&nbsp;17.3).
</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can estimate the distance and adjust the 
value by comparing the total integrated counts in a simulated 
spectrum with the total integrated counts in an equivalent 
measured spectrum. The simulated counts will decrease as 
the square in the increase of the sample-to-detector distance.
</p>
<p>Detector Area
</p>
<p>The detector area is the nominal surface area of the detector 
crystal visible (unobstructed) from the perspective of the opti-
mal analysis point. The detector area is one of the values that 
detector vendors explicitly specify when describing a detector. 
Typical values of detector area are 5, 10, 30, 50, or 80&nbsp;mm2. The 
detector area does not account for area obstructed by grid bars 
on the window but does account for area obstructed by a col-
limator or other permanent pieces of hardware.
</p>
<p>Crystal Thickness
</p>
<p>The detection efficiency for hard (higher-energy) X-rays 
depends upon the thickness of the active detector crystal 
area. Si(Li) detectors tend to have much thicker crystals and 
thus measure X-rays with energies above 10&nbsp;keV more effi-
ciently. Silicon drift detectors (SDD) tend to be about an 
order of magnitude thinner and become increasingly trans-
parent to X-rays above about 10&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;DTSA-II defaults to a 
thickness of 5&nbsp; mm for Si(Li) detectors and 0.45&nbsp; mm for 
SDD.&nbsp;These values will work adequately for most purposes if 
a vendor specified value is unavailable.
</p>
<p>Number of&nbsp;Channels, Energy Scale, and&nbsp;Zero 
</p>
<p>Offset
</p>
<p>A detector&rsquo;s energy calibration is described by three quanti-
ties&mdash;the number of bins or channels, the width of each bin 
(energy scale), and the offset of the zero-th bin (zero offset). 
The number of bins is often a power-of-two, most often 2,048 
but sometimes 1,024 or 4,096. This number represents the 
number of individual, adjacent energy bins in the spectrum. 
The width of each bin is assumed to be a nice constant&mdash;typ-
ically 10&nbsp; eV, 5&nbsp; eV, 2.5, or occasionally 20&nbsp; eV.&nbsp; The detector 
electronics are then adjusted (in older systems through phys-
ical potentiometers or in modern systems through digital 
calibration) to produce this width.
</p>
<p>The zero offset allows the vendor to offset (&lsquo;shift&rsquo;) the 
energy scale for the entire spectrum by a fixed energy or to 
compensate for a slight offset in the electronics. Some ven-
dors don&rsquo;t make use of ability and the zero offset is fixed at 
zero. Other vendors use a negative zero offset to measure 
the full width of an artificial peak they intentionally insert 
into the data stream at 0&nbsp; eV called the zero-strobe peak. 
The zero-strobe peak is often used to automatically correct 
for electronic drift. Often, DTSA-II can read these values 
from a vendor&rsquo;s spectrum file using the &ldquo;Import from spec-
trum&rdquo; tool.
</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to enter the exact energy scale and zero 
offset when you create the detector as the calibration tool can 
be used to refine these values.
</p>
<p>Resolution at Mn Kα (Approximate)
</p>
<p>The resolution is a measure of the performance of an EDS 
detector. Since the resolution depends upon X-ray energy in 
a predictable manner, the resolution is by long established 
standard reported as the &ldquo;full width half maximum&rdquo; (FWHM) 
of the Mn Kα peak (5.899&nbsp;keV).
</p>
<p>The full width at half-maximum is defined as the width of 
a peak as measured half way from the base to the peak. This 
is illustrated in the . Fig.&nbsp; 17.5. The full height is measured 
from the level of the continuum background to the top of the 
peak. A line is drawn across the peak at half the full height. 
To account for the finite bin width, a line is drawn on each 
side of the peak from the center of the bin above the line to 
the center of the bin below the line. The intersection of this 
diagonal line is assumed to be the true peak edge position. 
The width is then measured from these intersection points 
and calibrated relative to the energy scale.
</p>
<p>The graphical method for estimating the FWHM is not as 
accurate as numerical fitting of Gaussian line shapes. The 
calibration tool uses the numerical method and is the pre-
ferred method (. Fig.&nbsp;17.6).
</p>
<p>Azimuthal Angle
</p>
<p>The azimuthal angle describes the angular position of the 
detector rotated around the optic axis. The azimuthal angle is 
particularly important when modeling samples that are tilted 
or have complex morphology.

<p>Gold Layer, Aluminum Layer, Nickel Layer
</p>
<p>Detector crystals typically have conductive layers on their 
front face to ensure conductivity. These layers can be con-
structed by depositing various different metals on the sur-
face. The absorption profiles of these layers will decrease the 
efficiency of the detector. The layer thicknesses are particu-
larly relevant for simulation; however, other uncertainties 
usually exceed the effect of the conductive layer.
</p>
<p>Dead Layer
</p>
<p>The dead layer is an inactive or partially active layer of silicon 
on the front face of the detector. The dead layer will absorb 
some X-rays (particularly low energy X-rays) and produce 
few to no electron&ndash;hole pairs. The result is a fraction of X-rays 
which produce no signal or a smaller signal than their energy 
would suggest. The result is twofold: The first effect is a dimin-
ishment of the number of low energy X-rays detected. The

<p>second effect is a low energy tail, called incomplete charge 
collection, on low energy X-ray peaks.
</p>
<p>The dead layer in modern detectors is very thin and typi-
cally produces very little incomplete charge collection. Older 
Si(Li) detectors had thicker layers and worse incomplete 
charge collection.
</p>
<p>Zero Strobe Discriminator (. Figs.&nbsp;17.7 and&nbsp;17.8)
</p>
<p>The zero strobe discriminator is an energy below which all 
spectrum counts will be set to zero before many spectrum 
processing operations are performed.
</p>
<p>The zero strobe is an artificial peak inserted by the detec-
tor electronics at 0&nbsp;eV.&nbsp;The zero strobe is used to automati-
cally determine the noise performance of the detector and to 
automatically adjust the offset of the detector to compensate 
for shifts in calibration. The zero strobe does not interfere 
with real X-ray events because it is located below the energies 
at which the detector is sensitive.
</p>
<p>Some vendors automatically strip out the zero strobe out 
before presenting the spectrum. Others leave it in because it 
can provide useful information. When it does appear, it can 
negatively impact processing low energy peaks. To mitigate 
this problem, the zero strobe discriminator can be used to 
strip the zero strobe from the spectrum. The zero strobe dis-
</p>
<p>criminator should be set to an energy just above the high 
energy tail of the zero strobe.

<p>The material editor dialog is used to enter compositional and

<p>17.2  Simulation in&nbsp;DTSA-II
</p>
<p>17.2.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>Simulation, particularly Monte Carlo simulation, is a pow-
erful tool for understanding the measurement process. 
Without the ability to visualize how electrons and X-rays 
interact with the sample, it can be very hard to predict the 
significance of a measurement. Does the incident beam 
remain within the sample? Where are the measured X-rays 
coming from? Can I choose better instrumental conditions 
for the measurements? Without simulation, these insight 
can only be gained with years of experience or based on 
simple rules of thumb.
</p>
<p>Too often we are asked to analyze non-ideal samples. 
Monte Carlo simulation is one of the few mechanisms we have 
to ground-truth these measurements. Consider the humble 
particle. When is it acceptable to consider a particle to be 
essentially bulk and what are the approximate errors associ-
ated with this assumption?
</p>
<p>17.2.2  Monte Carlo Simulation
</p>
<p>Monte Carlo models are particularly useful because they 
permit the simulation of arbitrarily complex sample geom-
etries. NIST DTSA-II provides a handful of different

</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p> common geometries through the graphical user interface. 
More complex geometries can be simulated using the script-
ing interface.
</p>
<p>Monte Carlo modeling is based on simulating the trajec-
tories of thousands of electrons and X-rays. The simulated 
electrons are given an initial energy and trajectory which 
models the initial energy and trajectory of electrons from an 
SEM gun. The simulated electrons scatter and lose energy as 
their trajectories take them through the sample. Occasionally, 
an electron may ionize an atom and generate a characteristic 
X-ray. Occasionally, an electron may decelerate and gener-
ate a bremsstrahlung photon. The X-rays can be tracked 
from the point of generation to a simulated detector. A 
simulated spectrum can be accumulated. If care is taken 
modeling the electron transport and the X-ray interactions, 
the simulated spectrum can mimic a measured spectrum. 
Other data such as emitted intensities, emission images, tra-
jectory images and excitation volumes can be accumulated.
</p>
<p>Multi-element materials are modeled as mass-fraction 
averaged mixtures of elements. Complex sample geometries 
can be constructed out of discrete sample shapes that include 
blocks, spheres, cylinders, regions bounded by planar sur-
faces, and sums and differences of the basic shapes. In this way, 
it is possible to model arbitrarily complex sample geometries.
</p>
<p>       . Fig. 17.13 To assist the user, DTSA-II maintains a database of 
</p>
<p>materials. Each time the user enters a new material or redefines an 
</p>
<p>old material, the database is updated. The database is indexed by 
</p>

</p>
<p>represent end members of the plagioclase solid solution series. To 
</p>
<p>calculate a admixture of 50 % by mass albite and 50 % by mass anorthite, 
</p>
<p>you can enter the formula &ldquo;0.5*NaAlSi3O8 + 0.5*CaAl2Si2O8&rdquo;. Other 
</p>
<p>admixtures of stoichiometric compounds can be calculated in a similar 
</p>
<p>manner. Remember to provide a user friendly name for the database
</p>
<p>       . Fig. 17.12 It is possible to enter the chemical formula directly into 
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;Name&rdquo; edit box. When the search button is pressed the chemical 
</p>
<p>formula will be parsed and the appropriate mass and atomic fractions 
</p>
<p>entered into the table. Capitalization of the element abbreviations is 
</p>
<p>important as &ldquo;CO&rdquo; is very different from &ldquo;Co&rdquo;&mdash;one is a gas and the other 
</p>
<p>a metal. More complex formulas like fluorapatite (&ldquo;Ca

</p>
<p>entered using parenthesis to group terms. It is important that the for-
</p>
<p>mula is unambiguous. Once the formula has been parsed you may

<p>17.2.3  Using the&nbsp;GUI To&nbsp;Perform 
a&nbsp;Simulation
</p>
<p>The simplest way to simulate one of an array of common 
sample geometries in through the &ldquo;simulation alien.&rdquo; The 
&ldquo;simulation alien&rdquo; is a dialog that takes you step-by-step 
through the process of simulating an X-ray spectrum. The 
dialog requests information that defines the sample geome-
try, the instrument, and detector, the measurement condi-
tions and the information to simulate. The results of the 
simulation include a spectrum, raw intensity data, electron 
trajectory images, X-ray emission images, and excitation vol-
ume information. The &ldquo;simulation alien&rdquo; is accessed through 
the &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; application menu (. Fig.&nbsp;17.15).
</p>
<p>Many different common sample geometries are available 
through the &ldquo;simulation alien.&rdquo;

</p>
<p>Each simulation mode takes different parameters to config-
ure the sample geometry. This page is for the simulation of a 
cube which requires two materials (substrate and cube), the 
dimensions of the cube and the sample rotation.
</p>
<p>The sample rotation parameter is available for all modes 
for which are not rotationally invariant. The best way to 
understand the sample rotation parameter is to imagine 
rotating the sample about the optic axis at the point on the 
</p>
<p>sample at which the beam intersects (. Figs.&nbsp; 17.29, 17.30, 
and 17.31).
</p>
<p>All the models require you to specify at least one material. 
The material editor (described elsewhere) allows you to spec-
ify the material. Since the density is a critical parameter, you 
must specify it (. Fig.&nbsp;17.32).
</p>
<p>Simulations are designed to model the spectra you could 
collect on your instrument with your detector. By default, the 
simulation &ldquo;instrument configuration&rdquo; page assumes that 
you want to simulate the &ldquo;default detector&rdquo; as specified on the 
main &ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo; tab. However, you can specify a different 
instrument, detector and calibration if you desire.
</p>
<p>You also need to specify an incident beam energy. This is 
the kinetic energy with which the electrons strike the sample 
and is specified in kilo-electronvolts (keV).

<p>(nA &middot; s = nC). This quantity is a product of the probe current 
(nA) and the spectrum acquisition live-time (seconds.) 
Remember the probe current is a measure of the actual 
number of electrons striking the sample per unit time, so the 
probe dose is equivalent to a number of electrons striking 
the sample during the measurement. Doubling the dose 
doubles the number of electrons striking the sample and 
thus also doubles the average number of X-rays generated in 
the sample.
</p>
<p>The incidence angle (nominally 0&deg;) allows you to simu-
late a tilted sample (. Fig.&nbsp;17.33).
</p>
<p>The incident angle is defined relative to the optic axis. The 
pivot occurs at the surface of the sample, which is placed at 
the detector&rsquo;s optimal working distance. A positive rotation is 
towards the X-axis (an azimuth of 0&deg;) and a negative rotation 
towards the &ndash;X axis (an azimuth of 180&deg;.) The detector dis-
played is at an azimuth of 180&deg;. A negative incidence angle 
would tilt the sample toward the detector. Arbitrary tilts may 
be simulated by moving the detector around the azimuth 
(. Figs.&nbsp;17.33, 17.34, 17.35, and 17.36).
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;other options&rdquo; page allows you to specify whether 
the spectrum is simulated with or without variance due to 
count statistics. If you select to &ldquo;apply simulated count sta-
</p>
<p>tistics,&rdquo; you may also select to output multiple spectra based 
on the simulated spectrum but differ by pseudorandom 
count statistics. You may also select to run additional simu-
lated electron trajectories. The number of simulated elec-
tron trajectories determines the simulation to simulation 
variance in characteristic X-ray intensities. The default 
number of  electron trajectories typically produces about 1 % 
variance. The variance decreases as the square-root of the 
number of simulated trajectories. You may also specify 
which X-ray generation modes to simulate including both 
characteristic and bremsstrahlung primary emission and 
secondary emission due to characteristic primary emission 
or bremsstrahlung primary emission (. Figs.&nbsp; 17.37, 17.38, 
and 17.39).
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;configure VP&rdquo; page provides an advanced option to 
simulate the beam scatter in a variable-pressure or environ-
mental SEM.&nbsp;If the check box is selected, you may select a gas 
(&ldquo;water,&rdquo; &ldquo;helium,&rdquo; &ldquo;nitrogen,&rdquo; &ldquo;oxygen&rdquo; or &ldquo;argon&rdquo;), a gas path 
length and a nominal pressure. The gas path length is the dis-
tance from the final pressure limiting aperture to the sample. 
1&nbsp;Torr is equivalent to 133 Pa (. Figs.&nbsp;17.40 and 17.41).

<p>to simulate measured spectra like a spectrum collected from 
the specified material under the specified conditions on the 
specified detector. You can treat simulated spectra like 
measured spectra in the sense that you can simulate an 
&ldquo;unknown&rdquo; standards and reference spectra and quantify the 
&ldquo;unknown&rdquo; as though it had been measured (. Fig.&nbsp;17.42).
</p>
<p>The report tab contains additional details about the simu-
lation including configuration and results information. The 
first table summarizes the simulation configuration 
parameters. This table is available for all simulation modes 
(. Fig.&nbsp;17.43).
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;simulation results&rdquo; table contains additional 
details derived from the simulation. The first two lines 
contain links to the simulated spectrum and a Virtual 
Reality Markup Language (VRML) representation of the 
sample and electron trajectories. The subsequent rows 
contain raw data detailing the generation and emission of 
various different kinds of characteristic X-rays. Only those 
modes which were selected will be available. The generated 
X-rays column tabulates the relative number of X-rays 
</p>
<p>generated within the sample and emitted into a milli-stera-
dian. The emitted column tabulates the X-rays that are 
generated and also escape the sample in the direction of 
the detector. The ratio is the fraction of generated X-rays 
that escape the sample in the direction of the detector. The 
final rows compare the relative amount of characteristic 
fluorescence to the amount of primary characteristic and 
bremsstrahlung emission (. Fig.&nbsp;17.44).
</p>
<p>The emission images show where the measured X-rays 
were generated. Because the images only display X-rays 
that escape the sample, the distinction between the strongly 
absorbed X-rays like the O K-L3 (Kα) and the less strongly 
absorbed like the Si K-L3 (Kα) is evidenced by the flattened 
emission profile in the Si K-L3 image. The last image shows 
the first 100 simulated electron trajectories (down to a 
kinetic energy of 50&nbsp; eV.) The color of the trajectory seg-
ment varies as the electron passes through the different 
materials present in the sample. The gray lines exiting the 
top of the image are backscattered electrons (trajectories in 
vacuum).

<p>17.2.4  Optional Tables
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Fractional Emission Depths and Volumes&rdquo; Table 
(. Fig.&nbsp;17.45)
</p>
<p>When simulating a bulk sample, an additional report 
table shows the depth and the volumes from which 50 % or 
90 % of the measured X-rays are emitted. The depth and vol-
ume are largely determined by the ionization edge energy 
and X-ray absorption. Low ionization edge energies emit 
from larger volumes but lower energy X-rays also tend to be 
more strongly absorbed.
</p>
<p> The &ldquo;VP Scatter Data&rdquo; Table
</p>
<p>In variable pressure mode, the gas in the chamber can scatter 
the incident electrons before they strike the sample. Despite 
the fact that these scatters tend to be small angle events, the 
path length is relatively long and electrons can scatter hun-
dreds of microns to millimeters. The consequence can be 
demonstrated by simulating a moderate sized inclusion, 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;17.46. In simulated high-vacuum mode, the 
excitation volume remains entirely within the inclusion. In 
simulated variable-pressure mode, the electrons can scatter 
out of the beam, entirely missing the inclusion and striking 
the surrounding matrix.
</p>
<p>One way to understand the scatter is to consider a series of 
concentric rings on the surface of the sample centered at the 
beam axis. The &ldquo;VP Scatter Data&rdquo; table (. Fig.&nbsp; 17.47), sum-
marizes the number and number fraction of the incident elec-
trons which intersect the various rings. In this simulation, 
87 % of the initial electrons are undeflected. However, at least 
one electron (0.1 %) is scattered further than 700&nbsp;μm and 1.2 % 
are scattered more than 50&nbsp;μm. This qualitative information is 
useful because it gives us a sense of how significant beam scat-
ter will be in variable pressure mode. It gives a sense of whether 
true quantitative analysis is possible and how much of an error 
will be introduced by the beam scatter. The consequences are 
evident in the spectrum from an inclusion of admiralty brass 
in an aluminum. The aluminum is present in significant quan-
tities in the variable pressure mode acquisition.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;17.48 shows EDS spectra calculated for a brass 
inclusion in an aluminum matrix under VPSEM (red) and 
conventional vacuum (blue) operation. The large peak for Al 
under VPSEM conditions reveals the extent of gas scattering 
outside the focused beam. Interestingly, the Al is not zero in 
the &ldquo;high-vacuum&rdquo; spectrum because of continuum gener-
ated secondary fluorescence. Increasing the size of the inclu-
sion does not eliminate the slight Al peak but turning off the 
simulation of continuum fluorescence does.

<p>kOverview
</p>
<p>Qualitative elemental analysis involves the assignment of ele-
ments to the characteristic X-ray peaks recognized in the 
energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) spectrum. This 
function is routinely performed with automatic peak identi-
fication (e.g., &ldquo;AutoPeakID&rdquo;) software embedded in the ven-
dor EDS system. While automatic peak identification is a 
valuable tool, the careful analyst will always manually iden-
tify elements by hand first and only use the automatic peak 
identification to confirm the manual elemental identifica-
tion, even at the level of major constituents (mass concentra-
tion, C &gt; 0.1), but especially for minor (0.01 &le; C &le; 0.1) and 
trace (C &lt; 0.1) constituents. Using automatic peak identifica-
tion before manual identification tends to lead to a cognitive 
flaw called confirmation bias&nbsp;- the tendency to interpret data 
in a way that confirms one&rsquo;s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.
</p>
<p>18.1  Quality Assurance Issues for 
Qualitative Analysis: EDS Calibration
</p>
<p>Before attempting automatic or manual peak identification, it is 
critical that the EDS system be properly calibrated to ensure that 
accurate energy values are measured for the characteristic X-ray 
peaks. Follow the vendor&rsquo;s recommended procedure to rigor-
ously establish the calibration. The calibration procedure typi-
cally involves measuring a known material such as copper that 
provides characteristic X-ray peaks at low photon energy (e.g., 
Cu L
</p>
<p>3
-M
</p>
<p>5
 at 0.928&nbsp;keV) and at high photon energy (Cu K-L
</p>
<p>3
 at 
</p>
<p>8.040&nbsp;keV). Alternatively, a composite aluminum-copper target 
(e.g., a copper penny partially wrapped in aluminum foil and 
continuously scanned so as to excite both Al and Cu) can be used 
to provide the Al K-L
</p>
<p>3
 (1.487&nbsp;keV) as the low energy peak and 
</p>
<p>Cu K-L
3
 for the high energy peak. After calibration, peaks occur-
</p>
<p>ring within this energy range (e.g., Ti K-L
3
 at 4.508&nbsp;keV and Fe 
</p>
<p>K-L
3
 at 6.400&nbsp;keV) should be measured to confirm linearity. A 
</p>
<p>well- calibrated EDS should produce measured photon energies 
within &plusmn;2.5&nbsp; eV of the ideal value. Low photon energy peaks 
below 1&nbsp;keV photon energy should also be measured, for exam-
ple, O K (e.g., from MgO) and C K.&nbsp;For some EDS systems, non-
linearity may be encountered in the low photon energy range. 
. Figure&nbsp;18.1 shows an EDS spectrum for CaCO
</p>
<p>3
 in which the 
</p>
<p>O K peak at 0.523&nbsp;keV is found at the correct energy, but the C K 
peak at 0.282&nbsp;keV shows a significant deviation below the correct 
energy due to non-linear response in this range caused by 
incomplete charge collection.
</p>
<p>All calibration spectra should be stored as part of the 
laboratory Quality Assurance documentation, and the 
calibration procedure should be performed regularly, prefer-
ably weekly and especially whenever the EDS system is pow-
ered down and restarted.
</p>
<p>18.2  Principles of&nbsp;Qualitative EDS Analysis
</p>
<p>The knowledge base needed to accomplish high-confidence 
peak identification consists of three components: (1) the phys-
ics of characteristic X-ray generation and propagation; (2) a 
complete database of the energies of all critical ionization 
energies and corresponding characteristic peaks for all ele-
ments (except H and He, which do not produce characteristic 
X-rays); and (3) the artifacts inherent in EDS measurement.
</p>
<p>18.2.1  Critical Concepts From&nbsp;the&nbsp;Physics 
of&nbsp;Characteristic X-ray Generation 
and&nbsp;Propagation
</p>
<p>What factors determine if characteristic peaks are generated 
and detectable?
</p>
<p> Exciting Characteristic X-Rays
</p>
<p>A specific characteristic X-ray can only be produced if the 
incident beam energy, E
</p>
<p>0
, exceeds the critical ionization 
</p>
<p>energy, E
c
, for the atomic shell whose ionization leads to the 
</p>
<p>emission of that characteristic X-ray. This requirement is 
parameterized as the overvoltage, U
</p>
<p>0
:
</p>
<p>U E E
0 0
</p>
<p>1= &gt;/
c  
</p>
<p>(18.1)
</p>
<p>Note that for a particular element, if the beam energy is 
selected so that U
</p>
<p>0
 &gt; 1 for the K-shell, then for higher atomic 
</p>
<p>number elements with complex atomic shell structures, shells 
with lower values of E
</p>
<p>c
 will also be ionized; for example, if Cu 
</p>
<p>K-shell X-rays are created, there will also be Cu L-shell 
X-rays, Au L-family, and Au M-family X-rays, etc.
</p>
<p>While U
0
 &gt; 1 sets the minimum beam energy criterion to 
</p>
<p>generate a particular characteristic X-ray, the relative inten-
sity of that X-ray generated from a thick target (where the 
thickness exceeds the electron range) depends on the over-
voltage and the incident beam current, i

tinuum intensity, I
</p>
<p>cm
, that forms the spectral background at 
</p>
<p>all photon energies up to E
0
 (the Duane&ndash;Hunt limit), arises 
</p>
<p>from the electron bremsstrahlung and depends on the photon 
energy, E

</p>
<p>The characteristic peak to continuum background, P/B, 
which determines the visibility of peaks above the back-
ground, is found as the ratio of equations (18.2) and 
(18.3b):
</p>

</p>
<p>(18.4)
</p>
<p>Since the exponent n ~ 1.5, in the expression for P/B the value 
of n &minus; 1 ~ 0.5, so that as U
</p>
<p>0
 is lowered, the P/B decreases dra-
</p>
<p>matically, reducing the visibility of peaks, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;18.2 for the K-shell peaks of silicon.
</p>
<p> Fluorescence Yield
</p>
<p>A second factor that affects the detectability of characteristic 
peaks is the fluorescence yield, the fraction of ionizations that 
leads to photon emission. The fluorescence yield varies sharply 
</p>
<p>depending on the shells involved, with the fluorescence yields 
for a particular element generally trending K &gt; L &gt; &gt; M.&nbsp; An 
example for barium L-shell and M-shell X-rays is shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;18.3, where the Ba M-family X-rays are seen to have a 
much lower P/B than the Ba L-family X-rays, making Ba dif-
ficult to identify with high confidence if only the Ba M-family 
is excited, a condition that will exist for Ba if E
</p>
<p>0
 is chosen 
</p>
<p>below the 5.25&nbsp;keV ionization energy for the Ba L
3
- shell.
</p>
<p> X-ray Absorption
</p>
<p>A third factor which can strongly influence the visibility and 
detection of peaks is absorption of characteristic X-rays as 
they travel through the specimen and the window and sur-
face layers of the EDS detector. X-ray absorption along a path 
of length s through the specimen is a non-linear process:

<p>where I
0
 is the original intensity and I is the intensity that 
</p>
<p>remains after path s through a material of density ρ having a 
mass absorption coefficient μ/ρ for the photon energy of 
interest. The mass absorption coefficient depends strongly on 
the photon energy and the specific elements that the photons 
are passing through. Generally, a photon will be strongly 
absorbed, i.e., there will be a large mass absorption coeffi-
cient, if the energy of the photon lies in a range of approxi-
mately 1&nbsp;keV above the critical ionization energy for another 
element that is present in the analyzed volume. An extreme 
case is illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;18.4 for SiC, where at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV 
</p>
<p>with the spectrum scaled to the Si K-peak, the C K peak is 
barely visible despite C&rsquo;s making up half of the composition 
on an atomic basis. Strong absorption of the C K X-ray at 
0.282&nbsp;keV occurs because this energy lies just above the Si L
</p>
<p>3
 
</p>
<p>critical ionization energy at 0.110&nbsp; keV, resulting in an 
extremely large value for the mass absorption coefficient. 
(There are also other factors that apply to this case, including 
the relative fluorescence yields, for which ω
</p>
<p>C
 &lt; ω
</p>
<p>Si
, and the 
</p>
<p>relative detector efficiency, ε
C &lt;
</p>
<p> ε
Si,
</p>
<p> as described in the &ldquo;EDS&rdquo; 
module.) Because the absorption path length, s, depends 
strongly on the electron range, R
</p>
<p>K-O
, which scales 
</p>
<p>approximately as the 1.7 power of the incident beam energy, 
decreasing the beam energy reduces the absorption path of 
the C K X-rays, making the C K-peak more prominent rela-
tive to the Si K-peak, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;18.4 for a series of 
progressively lower beam energies.
</p>
<p>The possibility of a high absorption situation for elements 
that must be measured with a low photon energy requires an 
analytical strategy such that when analyzing an unknown, 
the analyst should start at high beam energy, E
</p>
<p>0
 &ge; 20&nbsp;keV, and 
</p>
<p>work down in beam energy. The analyst must be prepared to 
utilize low beam energies, E
</p>
<p>0
 &le; 5&nbsp;keV, to evaluate the possibil-
</p>
<p>ity of high absorption situations, such as those encountered 
for low atomic number elements (Z &lt; 10). For these elements, 
the only detectable peaks have low photon energies (&lt;1&nbsp;keV) 
and are thus subject to high absorption when high incident 
beam energy is used.

<p>18.2.2  X-Ray Energy Database: Families 
of&nbsp;X-Rays
</p>
<p>The X-ray energy database is typically accessed through 
EDS software as a display of &ldquo;KLM&rdquo; markers showing the 
position of the peak (and possibly also the corresponding 
critical ionization energies) and the relative peak heights of 
the members of each X-ray family, examples of which are 
seen in . Figs.&nbsp; 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, and 18.4. The underlying 
database must contain such all characteristic X-rays (for 
ionization energies up to 25&nbsp;keV) for all elements (except-
ing H and He which do not produce characteristic X-rays). 
No elements should be excluded, all X-ray families with 
photon energies below 30&nbsp;keV should be included, and no 
minor X-ray family members should be excluded. As an 
example, a section of the DTSA-II X-ray energy database 
that displays the information for gold is presented in 
. Table&nbsp;18.1. While it is true that many of the closely spaced 
(in photon energy) and low abundance X-ray peaks cannot 
</p>
<p>be resolved by EDS because of the limited energy resolution, 
these peaks are nevertheless convolved in the measured 
spectrum. When a constituent is present at high concentra-
tion and is excited with adequate overvoltage, at least some 
of these low abundance family members will be readily 
detectable, for example, the L

 peaks seen in . Fig.&nbsp;18.6. Note also

<p>that the low energy performance of the silicon drift detec-
tor (SDD)-EDS is such that the Au N- family peaks are 
detected.

<p> Si Escape Peak
</p>
<p>The Si escape peak results when a Si K&ndash;L
3
 X-ray 
</p>
<p>(E = 1.740&nbsp; keV), which is created following the photoion-
ization of a silicon atom and is usually reabsorbed within 
the detector volume, escapes. This results in an energy loss 
of 1.740&nbsp; keV from the parent X-ray, creating a &ldquo;silicon 
escape peak,&rdquo; as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;18.7 (upper spectrum) for 
the titanium K-family X-rays. Escape peaks can only be 
created for parent photon energies above 1.740&nbsp;keV and are 
formed at a fixed fraction of the parent peak, with that frac-
tion rapidly decreasing as the parent X-ray energy increases 
above 1.740&nbsp; keV.&nbsp; For parent peaks with photon energies 
above 6&nbsp;keV, escape peaks are so small that they are difficult 
to detect. Escape peaks can occur from any parent peak, but 
as a practical matter only the major members of a family 
are likely to produce detectable escape peaks. Note that in 
the example shown for the titanium K-family in . Fig.&nbsp;18.7, 
the escape peaks for Ti K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 and Ti K-M
</p>
<p>2,3
 are both 
</p>
<p>detected because of the high count spectrum. The EDS sys-
tem should mark all possible escape peaks and not subse-
quently misidentify them as other elements. For example, if 
not properly assigned, the escape peak for Ti K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 could 
</p>
<p>be mistaken for Cl K-L
2,3
</p>
<p>. Note that some vendor software 
removes the escape peaks in the final processed spectrum 
that is displayed to the user, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;18.7 (lower 
spectrum).
</p>
<p> Coincidence Peaks
</p>
<p>Although the EDS spectrum may appear to an observer to be 
collected simultaneously at all photon energies, in reality 
only one photon can be measured at a time. Because X-rays 
are created randomly in time, as the rate of production (input 
count rate) increases, the possibility of two photons entering 
the detector and creating an artifact coincidence event 
increases in probability. An inspection function continu-
ously monitors the detector to reject such events, but at

<p> sufficiently high input count rates its finite time resolution 
will be overwhelmed and coincidence events will begin to 
populate the spectrum. This phenomenon is illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp;18.7 for pure Ti, where coincidence peaks are seen for

. The height of a 
</p>
<p>coincidence peak relative to the parent peak depends on the 
arrival rate of X-rays at the detector, and thus upon the dead-
time. Even at low dead-time coincidence events are likely to 
be observed for highly excited, low photon energy peaks 
such as Al and Si in pure element or high concentration tar-
gets, as shown for Si in . Fig.&nbsp;18.8 at 12 % dead-time and in 
. Fig.&nbsp;18.9 at 1 % dead- time. Operating at low dead-time can 
reduce the height of the coincidence peak relative to the par-
ent peak, but coincidence can never entirely be eliminated by 
reducing the input count rate. For complex compositions, a 
wide array of coincidence peaks involving many combina-
tions of highly excited peaks can be encountered, as shown 
</p>
<p>in . Fig.&nbsp;18.10. As the dead-time increases, numerous coinci-
dence peaks are observed, several of which could be mis-
identified as elements present as trace to minor constituents. 
At the highest dead- times, the coincidence peaks are seen to 
occupy much of the useful spectral energy range where legit-
imate minor and trace constituents might be measured. 
Coincidence can involve any two photons of any energies, 
but the noticeable effects in EDS spectra consist of two char-
acteristic peak photons that originate from major constitu-
ents that are highly excited, for exmple, A + A, A + B, B + B, 
an so on. Since coincidence depends on the arrival rate of 
photons, the analyst can exert some control by operating at 
low dead-time (10 % or less) to minimize but not eliminate 
the effect. Some vendor EDS systems use statistical models of 
coincidence to post process the spectrum, removing the 
coincidence events and restoring the events to their proper 
parent peaks.

Analysis
</p>
<p>18.3.1  Why Are Skills in&nbsp;Manual Qualitative 
Analysis Important?
</p>
<p>The automatic peak identification function supplied in all 
vendor software is a powerful and useful tool, but it should 
only be used to confirm manual identifications rather 
than vice versa. Studies have shown that incorrect peak 
assignments occur with vendor software in a few percent of 
analyses even for major constituents (C &gt; 0.1 mass fraction, 
10 weight percent) that produce prominent spectral peaks 
(Newbury 2005). . Table&nbsp; 18.2 lists groups of elements for 
which incorrect peak assignments have been observed in 
vendor software from different sources. Extensive observa-
tions suggest that peak misidentifications occur for major 
</p>
<p>constituents in several percent of qualitative analyses of 
major constituents. The problem of incorrect assignments 
becomes even more significant for minor and trace constitu-
ents that produce peaks that inevitably occur at low peak-
to- background and for which it may be difficult to recognize 
more than one characteristic peak (Newbury 2009). The fre-
quency of incorrect peak assignments for minor and trace 
constituents can be 10 % or more, with both false positives 
(incorrect peak assignments) and false negatives (legitimate 
peaks ignored). For operation at low beam energy where the 
incident beam energy restricts the atomic shells which can be 
ionized to produce X-rays, peak identification is even more 
problematic at all concentration levels (Newbury 2007).
</p>
<p>For minor and trace constituents, incorrect elemental 
identifications arise from incomplete identification of minor 
family members of X-ray families actually associated with 
previously identified major constituents, as well as artifact

<p>peaks that arise from the silicon escape peak and from coin-
cidence peaks. A particularly insidious problem occurs when 
automatic peak identification software delivers identifica-
tions of peaks with low peak-to-background too early in the 
EDS accumulation before adequate counts have been 
recorded. Statistical fluctuations in the continuum back-
ground create &ldquo;false peaks&rdquo; that may appear to correspond to 
minor or trace constituents. This problem can be recognized 
when an apparent peak identification solution for these low 
level peaks subsequently changes as more counts are accu-
mulated. The danger is that the analyst may choose to stop 
the accumulation prematurely and be misled by the low level 
&ldquo;peaks&rdquo; that do not actually exist.
</p>
<p>When the analyst must operate only at low beam energy 
(E
</p>
<p>0
 &le; 5&nbsp; keV), the peak misidentification problem is exacer-
</p>
<p>bated by the loss of the higher photon energies where X-ray 
family members are more widely spread and more easily 
identified, as well as the confidence-increasing redundancy 
provided by having K-L and L-M family pairs for identifica-
tion of intermediate and high atomic number elements 
(Newbury 2009).
</p>
<p>Even well-implemented automatic peak identification 
software is likely to ignore peaks with low peak-to- 
background that may correspond to trace constituents 
because the likelihood of a mistake becomes so large. Thus, if 
</p>
<p>it is important to the analyst to identify the presence of a 
trace element (s) with a high degree of confidence, manual 
peak identification will be necessary.

Analysis: Choosing the&nbsp;Instrument

</p>
<p> Beam Energy
</p>
<p>Equation&nbsp;18.1 reveals that one selection of the beam energy 
may not be sufficient to solve a particular problem, and the 
analyst must be prepared to explore a range of beam energies 
to access desired atomic shells. The peak height relative to the 
spectral background increases rapidly as U
</p>
<p>0
 is increased, 
</p>
<p>enabling better detection of the characteristic peak (s). Having 
adequate overvoltage is especially important as the concen-
tration of an element decreases from major to minor to trace. 
As a general rule, it is desirable to have U
</p>
<p>0
 &gt; 2 for the analyzed 
</p>
<p>shells of all elements that occur in a particular analysis. For 
initial surveying of an unknown specimen, it is useful to select 
a beam energy of 20&nbsp;keV or higher to provide an overvoltage 
of at least 2 for ionization edges up to 10&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;Elements with 
intermediate atomic numbers (e.g., 22, Ti &le; Z &le; 42, Mo) and 
high atomic number (e.g., Z &ge; 56, Ba) elements have complex

<p>atomic shell structures that produce two families of detectable 
characteristic X-rays (with 20&nbsp;keV &le; E
</p>
<p>0
 &le; 30&nbsp;keV), for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, the Cu K-family and L-family; the Au L-family and 
M-family. A second advantage of selecting the beam energy to 
excite the higher energy X-ray family for an element is that it 
enables a high confidence identification since the peaks that 
form the family are more widely separated in photon energy 
and thus more likely to be resolved with EDS.&nbsp;Note that the 
physics of X-ray generation requires that all members of the 
X-ray family of a tentative elemental assignment must be 
present. Identifying all family members in the correct relative 
intensity ratios gives high confidence that the element assign-
ment is correct as well as avoiding subsequent misidentifica-
tion of these minor family members.
</p>
<p> Choosing the&nbsp;EDS Resolution (Detector Time 
Constant)
</p>
<p>EDS systems provide two or more choices for the detector 
time constant. The user has a choice of a short detector time 
constant that gives higher throughput (photons recorded per 
unit time) at the expense of poorer peak resolution or a long 
time constant that improves the resolution at the cost of 
throughput. The analyst thus has a critical choice to make: 
more counts per unit time or better resolution. Statham (1995) 
analyzed these throughput-resolution trade-offs with respect 
to various analytical situations and concluded that a strategy 
that emphasizes maximizing the number of X-ray counts 
rather than resolution produces the most robust results.
</p>
<p> Choosing the&nbsp;Count Rate (Detector  
Dead- Time)
</p>
<p>A closely related consideration is the problem of pulse coinci-
dence creating artifact peaks, which are reduced (but not 
eliminated) by using lower dead-time. Note that a specific level 
of dead-time, for example, 10 %, corresponds to a higher 
throughput when a shorter time constant is chosen. With the 
beam energy and detector time constant selected, the rate at 
which X-rays arrive at the EDS and subsequent output depends 
on two factors: (1) the detector solid angle and (2) the beam 
current. If the EDS detector is movable relative to the speci-
men, the specimen-to-detector distance should be chosen in a 
consistent fashion to enable subsequent return to the same 
operating conditions for robust standards-based quantitative 
analysis. A typical choice is to move the detector as close to the 
specimen as possible to maximize the detector solid angle, 
Ω = A/r2, by minimizing r, the detector-to- specimen distance, 
where A is the active area of the detector. Always ensure that 
any possible stage motions will not cause the specimen to 
strike the EDS.&nbsp;With the EDS solid angle fixed, the input count 
rate will then be controlled by the beam current. A useful strat-
egy is to choose a beam current that creates an EDS dead-time 
of approximately 10 % on a highly excited characteristic X-ray, 
such as Al K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 from pure aluminum. To establish dose-cor-
</p>
<p>rected standards- based quantitative analysis, this same detec-
tor solid angle and beam current should be used for all 
</p>
<p>measurements. It is often desirable to maximize the recorded 
counts per unit of real (clock) time. Higher beam current lead-
ing to higher dead-time, for example, 30&ndash;40 %, can be utilized, 
but the spectrum is likely to have coincidence peaks like those 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;18.10, which can greatly complicate the recog-
nition and measurement of the peaks of minor and trace con-
stituents. Note that some vendor software systems effectively 
block coincidence peaks or else remove them from the spec-
trum by post-processing with a stochastic model that predicts 
coincidence peaks based on the parent peak count rates.
</p>
<p> Obtaining Adequate Counts
</p>
<p>The analyst must accumulate adequate X-ray counts to dis-
tinguish a peak against the random fluctuations of the back-
ground (X-ray continuum). While it is relatively easy to 
record sufficient counts to recognize the principal peak for 
a major constituent, detection of the minor family member 
(s) to increase confidence in the elemental assignment may 
require recording a substantially greater total count. For 
minor or trace constituents, an even greater dose is likely to 
be required just to detect the principal family members, and 
to obtain minor family members to increase confidence in 
an elemental identification will require a dose greater by 
another factor of ten or more. A peak is considered detect-
able if it satisfies the following criterion (Currie 1968):
</p>
<p>n n
P B
&gt;3
</p>
<p>1 2/
</p>
<p> 
(18.6)
</p>
<p>where n
P
 is the number of peak counts and n
</p>
<p>B
 is the number 
</p>
<p>of background counts under the peak. Note that &ldquo;detectable&rdquo; 
does not imply optimally measureable, for example, obtain-
ing accurate peak energy. While Eq.&nbsp; 18.6 defines the mini-
mum counts to detect a peak, accurate measurement of the 
peak position to identify the peak may require higher counts. 
The effect of increasing the total spectral intensity to &ldquo;develop&rdquo; 
low relative intensity peaks from trace constituents is shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;18.11.
</p>
<p>kGolden Rule
</p>
<p>If it is difficult to recognize a peak above fluctuations in the 
background, accumulate more counts. Patience is a virtue!
</p>
<p>18.4  Identifying the&nbsp;Peaks
</p>
<p>After a suitable spectrum has been accumulated, the analyst 
can proceed to perform manual qualitative analysis.
</p>
<p>18.4.1  Employ the&nbsp;Available Software Tools
</p>
<p>Manual qualitative analysis is performed using the support of 
available software tools such as KLM markers that show the 
energy positions and relative heights of X-ray family mem-
bers to assign peaks recognized in the spectrum to specific 
elements. Before using this important software tool, the user 
</p>
<p> Chapter 18 &middot; Qualitative Elemental Analysis by Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometry</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>279 18
</p>
<p>should confirm that all elements in the periodic table are 
enabled and all X-ray family members are shown in the KLM 
markers.
</p>
<p>As each element is tentatively identified from its major 
family peak, a systematic search must then be made to locate 
all possible peaks that must be associated with that element: 
(1) all minor family members; (2) a second X-ray family at 
lower energy (e.g., K and L or L and M), and for the highest 
atomic number elements, the N-family can also be observed, 
as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;18.6; and (3) any associated EDS artifact 
peaks (escape peaks and coincidence peaks). This careful 
inspection regimen and meticulous bookkeeping raises the 
confidence in the tentative assignment. Properly assigning 
the minor family members and the artifact peaks to the 
proper element will diminish the possibility of subsequent 
incorrect assignment of those peaks to other constituents 
that might appear to be present at minor or trace levels.
</p>
<p>It can be helpful to think of qualitative analysis as the pro-
cess of eliminating those elements which cannot possibly be 
present rather than the process of including those that 
</p>
<p> definitely are present. It isn&rsquo;t the natural perspective and it 
takes more thought and effort but it is much less prone to 
errors of omission.
</p>
<p>Imagine that you are at a zoo. You have a list of 20 animals 
of various sizes and shapes and you are asked to answer the 
question, what animals in this list could possibly be in this cage. 
You look around and see a rhinoceros laying down near the 
back of the cage and no other animal. You might be tempted to 
say that the only animal that could possibly be in the cage is 
the one you see&nbsp;&ndash; the rhinoceros. However, the list also con-
tains snakes, mice, fish and elephants.  You can rule out ele-
phants because they are too big to hide behind a rhino. You 
can rule out fish because the environment is inappropriate. 
You can&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that a mouse or snake is in the 
cage hidden behind the rhino. It is only by eliminating those 
animals that are too large (elephant) or can&rsquo;t survive (fish) 
behind the rhino that you can come to the full list of animals 
that could potentially be present in the cage&nbsp;&ndash; the rhino and 
any animals which could be hiding behind the rhino. If you 
want to be certain that you haven&rsquo;t missed an animal that

</p>
<p>Spectra are similar. Not only is it possible that the obvious 
elements are present but also those that could be hidden by the 
ones that are readily identified. Fortunately, there is a tool to help 
us to see through spectra and expose the hidden components&nbsp;&ndash; 
the residual spectrum. The residual spectrum is the intensity 
that remains in each channel after peak fitting has been per-
formed for the specified elements. It is like being able to ask the 
rhino to move and then being able to see what is hidden behind&nbsp;&ndash; 
maybe a mouse or a snake or maybe nothing. An example of the 
utility of the residual spectrum is shown in Figure 20.8.
</p>
<p>18.4.2  Identifying the&nbsp;Peaks: Major 
Constituents
</p>
<p>Start with peaks located in the higher photon energy 
(&gt;4&nbsp; keV) region of the spectrum and work downward in 
energy, even if there are higher peaks in the lower photon 
</p>
<p>energy region (&lt;4&nbsp; keV). The logic for this strategy is that 
K-shell and L-shell characteristic X-rays above 4&nbsp; keV are 
produced in families that provide two or more peaks with 
distinctive relative abundances for which the energy resolu-
tion of EDS is sufficient to easily separate these peaks. Having 
two or more peaks to identify greatly increases the confi-
dence with which an elemental identification can be made, 
enabling the analyst to achieve an unambiguous result. For 
each peak that is recognized, first test whether its energy cor-
responds closely to a particular K-L
</p>
<p>3
 (Kα) peak. The physics 
</p>
<p>of X-ray generation demands that the corresponding K-M
3
 
</p>
<p>(Kβ) peak must also be present in roughly a 10:1 ratio. If 
K-family peaks do not match the peak in question, examine 
L-family possibilities, noting that three or more L-peaks are 
likely to be detectable: L

<p>18.4.3  Lower Photon Energy Region
</p>
<p>As major spectral peaks located at lower photon energy 
(&lt;4&nbsp; keV) are considered, the energy separation diminishes 
and the relative peak heights decrease for the members of each 
X-ray family. EDS is no longer able to resolve these peaks, 
leading to a situation where only one peak is available for iden-
tification for K-family X-rays below 2&nbsp;keV in energy. The K-L
</p>
<p>3
 
</p>
<p>peak appears symmetric since the K-M
3
 peak has low relative 
</p>
<p>intensity, as shown for Al K-L
3
 in . Fig.&nbsp;18.13a. For L- and M- 
</p>
<p>family X-rays in the low photon energy range, the composite 
peak appears asymmetric. As shown for Br in . Fig.&nbsp;18.13b, 
the major peaks L

<p>3
-M
</p>
<p>5
(Lα) and L
</p>
<p>2
-M
</p>

</p>
<p>of approximately 2:1 and the low abundance but separated L

</p>
<p>viding the spectrum contains adequate counts. Similarly, the

(Mα) and M

</p>
<p>and the well separated minor family members W M

</p>
<p> 
(Mζ) and W M

<p>trum, as shown for W in . Fig.&nbsp;18.13c.
</p>
<p>18.4.4  Identifying the&nbsp;Peaks: Minor 
and&nbsp;Trace Constituents
</p>
<p>After all major peaks and their associated minor family mem-
bers and artifact peaks have been located and identified with 
high confidence as belonging to particular elements, the ana-
lyst can proceed to identify any remaining peaks which are 
now likely to be associated with minor and trace level constitu-
ents. Achieving the same degree of high confidence in the iden-
tification of lower concentration constituents is more difficult 
since the lower concentrations reduce all X-ray intensities so 
that minor family members are more difficult to detect. The 
situation is likely to require accumulating  additional X-ray 
counts to improve the detectability of minor X-ray family 
members and increase the confidence of the assignment of 
elemental identification. In general, establishing the presence 
of a constituent at trace level is a significant challenge that 
requires not only collecting a high count spectrum that satisfies 
the limit of detection criterion but also scrupulous attention to 
identifying all possible minor family members and artifacts 
from the X-ray families of the major and minor constituents.
</p>
<p>18.4.5  Checking Your Work
</p>
<p>The only way to be confident that the qualitative analysis is cor-
rect to quantify the spectrum and examine the residual spec-
trum. When every element has been correctly identified and 
quantified, the analytical total should be approximately unity 
and there should be no obvious structure in the residual spec-
trum that cannot be explained through chemistry or minor 
chemical peak shifts. This iterative qualitative &ndash;  quantitative 
analysis scheme to discover minor and trace elements hidden 
under the high intensity peaks of major constituents will 
 covered in 7 Chapter 19.
</p>
<p>18.5  A Worked Example of&nbsp;Manual Peak 
Identification
</p>
<p>Alloy IN100 is a complex mixture of transition and heavy ele-
ments that provides several challenges to manual peak iden-
tification:
 1. . Figure&nbsp;18.14a shows the spectrum from 0 to 20&nbsp;keV 
</p>
<p>excited with E
0
 = 20&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;Using the KLM marker tools in 
</p>
<p>DTSA II, starting at high photon energy and working 
downward, the first high peak encountered shows a 
good match to Ni K-L
</p>
<p>3
 and the corresponding Ni K-M
</p>
<p>3
 
</p>
<p>is also found at the correct ratio, as well as the Ni 
L-family at low photon energy. The position of the Ni 
K-L
</p>
<p>3
 escape peak is marked. Inspection for possible 
</p>
<p>coincidence peaks does not reveal a significant popula-
tion due to the low dead-time (8 %) used to accumulate 
the spectrum and the large number of peaks over which 
the input count rate is partitioned so that even the most 
intense peak has a relatively low count rate and does not 
produce significant coincidence.
</p>
<p> 2. Working down in energy (.  Fig.&nbsp;18.14b), the next 
peak is seen to correspond to Co K-L
</p>
<p>3
, but the Co 
</p>
<p>K-M
3
 suffers interference from Ni K-L
</p>
<p>3
 and only 
</p>
<p>appears as an asymmetric deviation on the high 
energy side. Likewise, the Co L-family is unresolved 
from the Ni L-family.
</p>
<p> 3. The next set of peaks match Cr, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;18.14c.
 4. Continuing, . Fig.&nbsp;18.14d shows a match for the peaks of 
</p>
<p>Ti, but the apparent ratio of Ti K-L
3
/Ti K-M
</p>
<p>3
 is approxi-
</p>
<p>mately 5:1, whereas the true ratio is about 10:1, which 
suggests that another element must be present. 
Expansion of this region in . Fig.&nbsp;18.14e reveals that V is 
likely to be present but with severe interference between 
V K-L
</p>
<p>3
 and Ti K-M
</p>
<p>3
. While the anomalous peak ratio 
</p>
<p>observed for TiK-L
3
/TiK- M
</p>
<p>3
 is a strong clue that another 
</p>
<p>element must be present, this example shows one of the 
limitations of manual peak identification, namely, that 
peaks representing minor and trace constituents can be 
lost under the higher intensity peaks of higher concen-
tration constituents as the concentration ratio becomes 
large. Detecting such interferences of constituents with 
large concentration ratios requires the careful peak- 
fitting procedure that is embedded in the quantitative 
analysis procedures described in module 19.
</p>
<p> 5. In . Fig.&nbsp;18.14f, the next peak group best matches the 
Mo L-family. This photon energy range involves possible 
interferences from the S K-family, the Mo L-family, and 
the Pb M-family. The possibility of identifying the peak 
group as the Pb M-family which occurs this energy 
range, can be rejected because of the absence of the Pb 
L-family, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;18.14g. The possible 
presence of the S K-family (. Fig.&nbsp;18.14h) is much more 
difficult to exclude because S cannot be effectively 
measured by an alternate X-ray family such as the S 
L-family due to the low fluorescence yield. While the 
shape of the peak cluster does not match S K-L
</p>
<p>3
 and S 
</p>
<p>K-M
3
, the presence of S can only be confidently

<p> 6.  The next peak matches the Al K-family (. Fig.&nbsp;18.14i) 
but in this photon energy range only one peak is 
available for identification. The Br L-family also fits this 
peak (. Fig.&nbsp;18.14j) but Br can be dismissed because of 
the absence of the Br K-family.
</p>
<p> 7. The last significant peak is found to correspond to C K 
(. Fig.&nbsp;18.14k) noting that due to the non- linearity of the 
photon energy scale for this detector below 400&nbsp;eV, the 
peak is displaced to a lower energy from the ideal position.
</p>
<p> 8. Finally, inspection of the remaining low peak-to- 
background peaks reveals just one candidate, which&nbsp;cor-
responds to the Si K-family (. Fig.&nbsp;18.14l).

<p>19.1  What Is a&nbsp;k-ratio?
</p>
<p>A k-ratio is the ratio of a pair of characteristic X-ray line 
intensities, I, measured under similar experimental condi-
tions for the unknown (unk) and standard (std):
</p>
<p>k I I=
unk
/
std  
</p>
<p>(19.1)
</p>
<p>The measured intensities can be associated with a single 
characteristic X-ray line (as is typically the case for wave-
length spectrometers) or associated with a family of charac-
teristic X-ray lines (as is typically the case for energy 
dispersive spectrometers.) The numerator of the k-ratio is 
typically the intensity measured from an unknown sample 
and the denominator is typically the intensity measured from 
a standard material&mdash;a material of known composition.
</p>
<p>Both the numerator and the denominator of the k-ratio 
must be measured under similar, well-controlled instrument 
conditions. The electron beam energy must be the same. The 
probe dose, the number of electrons striking the sample dur-
ing the measurement, should be the same (or the intensity 
scaled to equivalent dose.) The position of the sample relative 
to the beam and to the detector should be fixed. Both the 
sample and the standard(s) should be prepared to a high 
degree of surface polish, ideally to reduce surface relief below 
50&nbsp;nm, and the surface should not be chemically etched. If 
the unknown is non-conducting, the same thickness of con-
ducting coating, usually carbon with a thickness below 
10&nbsp; nm, should be applied to both the unknown and the 
standard(s). Ideally, the only aspect that should differ 
between the measurement of the unknown and the standard 
are the compositions of the materials.
</p>
<p>The k-ratio is the first estimate of material composition. 
From a set of k-ratios, we can estimate the unknown material 
composition. In many cases, to a good approximation:

</p>
<p>/

</p>
<p>~ =
 
</p>
<p>(19.2)
</p>
<p>where C
Z
,
unk
</p>
<p> and C
Z
,
std
</p>
<p> are the mass fraction of element Z in 
the unknown and standard, respectively, and k
</p>
<p>Z
 is the k-ratio 
</p>
<p>measured for element Z.&nbsp;This relationship is called &ldquo;Castaing&rsquo;s 
first approximation&rdquo; after the seminal figure in X-ray micro-
analysis, who established the k-ratio as the basis for quantita-
tive analysis (Castaing 1951).
</p>
<p>By taking a ratio of intensities collected under similar 
conditions, the k-ratio is independent of various pieces of 
poorly known information.
 1. The k-ratio eliminates the need to know the efficiency of 
</p>
<p>the detector since both sample and unknown are mea-
sured on the same detector at the same relative position. 
Since the efficiency as a multiplier of the intensity is 
identical in the numerator and denominator of the 
k-ratio, the efficiency cancels quantitatively in the ratio.
</p>
<p> 2.  The k-ratio mitigates the need to know the physics of the 
X-ray generation process if the same elements are excited 
under essentially the same conditions. The ionization 
cross section, the relaxation rates, and other poorly 
</p>
<p>known physical parameters are the same for an element 
in the standard and the unknown.
</p>
<p>In the history of the development of quantitative electron- 
excited X-ray microanalysis, the X-ray intensities for the 
unknown and standards were measured sequentially with a 
wavelength spectrometer in terms of X-ray counts. The raw 
measurement contains counts that can be attributed to both 
the continuum background (bremsstrahlung) and character-
istic X-rays. Since k-ratio is a function of only the character-
istic X-rays, the contribution of the continuum must be 
estimated. Usually, this is accomplished by measuring two 
off-peak measurements bounding the peak and using inter-
polation to estimate the intensity of the continuum back-
ground at the peak position. The estimated continuum is 
subtracted from the measured on peak intensity to give the 
characteristic X-ray line intensity.
</p>
<p>Extracting the k-ratio with an energy dispersive spec-
trometer can be done in a similar manner for isolated peaks. 
However, to deal with the peak interferences frequently 
encountered in EDS spectra, it is necessary to simultane-
ously consider all of the spectrum channels that span the 
mutually interfering peaks. Through a process called linear 
least squares fitting, a scale factor is computed which repre-
sents the multiplicative factor by which the integrated area 
under the characteristic peak from the standard must be 
multiplied by to equal the integrated area under the charac-
teristic peak from the unknown. This scale factor is the 
k-ratio, and the fitting process separates the intensity com-
ponents of the interfering peaks and the continuum back-
ground. The integrated counts measured for the unknown 
and for the standard for element Z enable an estimate of the 
precision of the measurement for that element. Linear least 
squares fitting is employed in NIST DTSA-II to recover char-
acteristic X-ray intensities, even in situations with extreme 
peak overlaps.
</p>
<p>A measured k-ratio of zero suggests that there is none of 
the associated element in the unknown. A measurement on a 
standard with exactly the same composition as the unknown 
will nominally produce a k-ratio of unity for all elements 
present. Typically, k-ratios will fall in a range from 0 to 10 
depending on the relative concentration of element Z in the 
unknown and the standard. A k-ratio less than zero can 
occur when count statistics and the fitting estimate of the 
background intensity conspire to produce a slightly negative 
characteristic intensity. Of course, there is no such thing as 
negative X-ray counts, and negative k-ratios should be set to 
zero before the matrix correction is applied. A k-ratio larger 
than unity happens when the standard generates fewer X-rays 
than the unknown. This can happen if the standard contains 
less of the element and/or if the X-ray is strongly absorbed by 
the standard. Usually, a well-designed measurement strategy 
won&rsquo;t result in a k-ratio much larger than unity. We desire to 
use a standard where the concentration of element Z is high 
so as to minimize the contribution of the uncertainty in the 
amount of Z in the standard to the overall uncertainty budget 
of the measurement, as well as to minimize the uncertainty

</p>
<p>contribution of the count statistics in the standard spectrum 
to the overall measurement precision. The ideal standard to 
maximize concentration is a pure element, but for those ele-
ments whose physical and chemical properties prohibit them 
from being used in the pure state, for example, gaseous ele-
ments such as Cl, F, I, low melting elements such as Ga or In, 
or pure elements which deteriorate under electron bombard-
ment, for example, P, S, a binary compound can be used, for 
example, GaP, FeS
</p>
<p>2
, CuS, KCl, etc.
</p>
<p>19.2  Uncertainties in&nbsp;k-ratios
</p>
<p>All k-ratio measurements must have associated uncertainty 
estimates. The primary source of uncertainty in a k-ratio 
measurement is typically count statistics although instru-
mental instability also can contribute. X-ray emission is a 
classic example of a Poisson process or a random process 
described by a negative exponential distribution.
</p>
<p>Negative exponential distributions are interesting because 
they are &ldquo;memoryless.&rdquo; For a sequence of events described by 
a negative exponential distribution, the likelihood of an 
event&rsquo;s occurring in an interval τ is equally as likely regard-
less of when the previous event occurred. Just because an 
event hasn&rsquo;t occurred for a long time doesn&rsquo;t make an event 
any more likely in the subsequent time interval. In fact, the 
most probable time for the next event is immediately follow-
ing the previous.
</p>
<p>If X-rays are measured at an average rate R, the average 
number of X-rays that will be measured over a time t is 
N = R &middot; t. Since the X-ray events occur randomly dispersed 
in time, the actual number measured in a time t will rarely 
ever be exactly N = R &middot; t. Instead, 68.2 % of the time the 
actual number measured will fall within the interval (N&nbsp;&ndash; 
ΔN, N + ΔN) where ΔN ~ N1/2 when N is large (usually true 
for X-ray counts). This interval is often called the &ldquo;one 
sigma&rdquo; interval. The one-sigma fractional uncertainty is 
thus N/N1/2 = 1/N1/2, which for constant R decreases as t 
increased. This is to say that generally, it is possible to make 
more precise measurements by spending more time making 
the measurement. All else remaining constant, for example, 
instrument stability and specimen stability under electron 
bombardment, a measurement taken for a duration of 4&nbsp; t 
will have twice the precision of a measurement take for t.
</p>
<p>Poisson statistics apply to both the WDS and EDS mea-
surement processes. For WDS, the on-peak and background 
measurements all have associated Poissonian statistical 
</p>
<p>uncertainties. For EDS, each channel in the spectrum has an 
associated Poissonian statistical uncertainty. In both cases, 
the statistical uncertainties must be taken into account care-
fully so that an estimate of the measurement precision can be 
associated with the k-ratio.
</p>
<p>The best practices for calculating and reporting measure-
ment uncertainties are described in the ISO Guide to 
Uncertainty in Measurement (ISO 2008). Marinenko and 
Leigh (2010) applied the ISO GUM to the problem of k-ratios 
and quantitative corrections in X-ray microanalytical mea-
surements. In the case of WDS measurements, the applica-
tion of ISO GUM is relatively straightforward and the details 
are in Marinenko and Leigh (2010). For EDS measurements, 
the process is more complicated. If uncertainties are associ-
ated with each channel in the standard and unknown spec-
tra, the k-ratio uncertainties are obtained as part of the 
process of weighted linear squares fitting.
</p>
<p>19.3  Sets of&nbsp;k-ratios
</p>
<p>Typically, a single compositional measurement consists of 
the measurement of a number of k-ratios&mdash;typically one or 
more per element in the unknown. The k-ratios in the set are 
usually all collected under the same measurement conditions 
but need not be. It is possible to collect individual k-ratios at 
different beam energies, probe doses or even on different 
detectors (e.g., multiple wavelength dispersive spectrometers 
or multiple EDS with different isolation windows).
</p>
<p>There may more than one k-ratio per element. Particularly 
when the data is collected on an energy dispersive spectrom-
eter, more than one distinct characteristic peak per element 
may be present. For period 4 transition metals, the K and L 
line families are usually both present. In higher Z elements, 
both the L and M families may be present. This redundancy 
provides a question&nbsp;&ndash; Which k-ratio should be used in the 
composition calculation?
</p>
<p>While it is in theory possible to use all the redundant 
information simultaneously to determine the composition, 
standard practice is to select the k-ratio which is likely to pro-
duce the most accurate measurement. The selection is non- 
trivial as it involves difficult to characterize aspects of the 
measurement and correction procedures. Historically, select-
ing the optimal X-ray peak has been something of an art. 
There are rules-of-thumb, but they involve subtle compro-
mises and deep intuition.
</p>
<p>This subject is discussed in more detail in Appendix 19.A. 
For the moment, we will assume that one k-ratio has been 
selected for each measured element.

</p>
<p>19.4  Converting Sets of&nbsp;k-ratios Into 
Composition
</p>
<p>As stated earlier, the k-ratio is often a good first approxima-
tion to the composition. However, we can do better. The 
physics of the generation and absorption of X-rays is suffi-
ciently well understood that we can use physical models to 
compensate for non-ideal characteristics of the measurement 
process. These corrections are called matrix corrections as 
they compensate for differences in the matrix (read matrix to 
mean &ldquo;material&rdquo;) between the standard material and the 
unknown material.
</p>
<p>Matrix correction procedures are typically divided into 
two classes φ(ρz) and ZAF-type corrections. The details will 
be discussed in Appendix 19.A. The distinction is primarily 
how the calculation is divided into independent sub-calcu-
lations. In a ZAF-type algorithm, the corrections for differ-
ences in mean atomic number (the Z term), X-ray absorption 
(the A term) and secondary fluorescence (the F term) are 
calculated separately. φ(ρz) matrix correction algorithms 
combine the Z and A terms into a single calculation. The 
distinction between φ(ρz) and ZAF is irrelevant for this dis-
cussion so the matrix correction will be described by the 
generic ZAF(C
</p>
<p>A
; P) where this expression refers to the 
</p>
<p>matrix correction associated with a material with composi-
tion C
</p>
<p>A
 and measurement parameters P. The terms k
</p>
<p>Z
 and 
</p>
<p>C
Z
 refer to the k-ratio and composition of the Z-th element 
</p>
<p>in the unknown.

<p>To state the task clearly, we have measured {k

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(19.5b)
</p>
<p>However, there is a problem. Our ability to calculate k
Z
 
</p>
<p>depends upon knowledge of the composition of the unknown, 
C
</p>
<p>unk
. Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t know the composition of the 
</p>
<p>unknown. That is what we are trying to measure.
Fortunately, we can use a trick called &ldquo;iteration&rdquo; or suc-
</p>
<p>cessive approximation to solve this dilemma. The strategy is 
as follows:
 1. Estimate the composition of the unknown. Castaing&rsquo;s First 
</p>
<p>Approximation is a good place to start.
 2. Calculate an improved estimate of C
</p>
<p>Z,unk
 based on the 
</p>
<p>previous estimated composition.
 3. Update the composition estimate based on the new calcu-
</p>
<p>lation.
 4. Test whether the resulting computed k-ratios are suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently similar to the measured k-ratios.
 5. Repeat steps 2&ndash;5 until step 4 is satisfied.
</p>
<p>While there is no theoretical guarantee that this algorithm 
will always converge or that the result is unique, in practice, 
this algorithm has proven to be extremely robust.
</p>
<p>19.5  The Analytical Total
</p>
<p>The result of the iteration procedure is a set of estimates of 
the mass fraction for each element in the unknown. We know 
these mass fractions should sum to unity&mdash;they account for 
all the matter in the material. However, the measurement 
process is not perfect and even with the best measurements 
there is variation around unity.
</p>
<p>The sum of the mass fractions is called the analytical total. 
The analytical total is an important tool to validate the mea-
surement process. If the analytic total varies significantly 
from unity, it suggests a problem with the measurement. 
Analytical totals less than one can suggest a missed element 
(such as an unanticipated oxidized region of the specimen), a 
reduced excitation volume, an unanticipated sample geome-
try (film or inclusion), or deviation from the measurement 
conditions between the unknown and standard(s). Analytic 
totals greater than unity likely arise because of measurement 
condition deviation or sample geometry issues.
</p>
<p>19.6  Normalization
</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, the analytical total is 
rarely exactly unity. When it isn&rsquo;t, the accuracy of a measure-
ment can often be improved by normalizing the measured 
mass fractions, C
</p>
<p>i
, by the analytical total of all N constituents 
</p>
<p>to produce the normalized mass fractions, C
i,n
</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>C C C
i,n i
</p>
<p>N
</p>
<p>i
=
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>/S
 
</p>
<p>(19.6)
</p>
<p>This procedure should be performed with care and the ana-
lytic total reported along with the normalized mass fractions. 
Normalization is not guaranteed to improve results and can 
cover up for some measurement errors like missing an ele-
ment or inappropriately accounting for sample morphology. 
The analytical total is important information and the nor-
malized mass fractions should never be reported without 
also reporting the analytical total. Any analysis which sums 
exactly to unity should be viewed with some skepticism.
</p>
<p>Careful inspection of the raw analytical total is a critical 
step in the analytical process. If all constituents present are 
measured with a standards-based/matrix correction proce-
dure, including oxygen (or another element) determined by 
the method of assumed stoichiometry, then the analytical 
total can be expected to fall in the range 0.98 to 1.02 (98 
weight percent to 102 weight percent). Deviations outside 
this range should raise the analyst&rsquo;s concern. The reasons for 
such deviations above and below this range may include 
unexpected changes in the measurement conditions, such as 
</p>
<p> Chapter 19 &middot; Quantitative Analysis: From&nbsp;k-ratio to&nbsp;Composition</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>293 19
</p>
<p>variations in the beam current, or problems with the speci-
men, such as local topography such as a pit or other excur-
sion from an ideal flat polished surface. For a deviation below 
the expected range, an important additional possibility is that 
there is at least one unmeasured constituent. For example, if 
a local region of oxidation is encountered while analyzing a 
metallic sample, the analytical total will drop to approxi-
mately 0.7 (70 weight percent) because of the significant frac-
tion of oxygen in a metal oxide. Note that &ldquo;standardless 
analysis&rdquo; (see below) may automatically force the analytical 
total to unity (100 weight percent) because of the loss of 
knowledge of the local electron dose used in the measure-
ment. Some vendor software uses a locally measured spec-
trum on a known material, e.g., Cu, to transfer the local 
measurement conditions to the conditions used to measure 
the vendor spectrum database. Another approach is to use 
the peak-to-background to provide an internal normaliza-
tion. Even with these approaches, the analytical total may not 
have as narrow a range as standards-based analysis. The ana-
lyst must be aware of what normalization scheme may be 
applied to the results. An analytical total of exactly unity (100 
weight percent) should be regarded with suspicion.
</p>
<p>19.7  Other Ways to&nbsp;Estimate C
Z
</p>
<p>k-ratios are not the only information we can use to estimate 
the amount of an element Z, C
</p>
<p>Z
. Sometimes it is not possible 
</p>
<p>or not desirable to measure k
Z
. For example, low Z elements, 
</p>
<p>like H or He, don&rsquo;t produce X-rays or low Z elements like Li, 
B and Be produce X-rays which are so strongly absorbed that 
few escape to be measured. In other cases, we might know 
the composition of the matrix material and all we really care 
about is a trace contaminant. Alternatively, we might know 
that certain elements like O often combine with other ele-
ments following predictable stoichiometric relationships. In 
these cases, it may be better to inject other sources of infor-
mation into our composition calculation algorithm.
</p>
<p>19.7.1  Oxygen by Assumed Stoichiometry
</p>
<p>Oxygen can be difficult to measure directly because of its 
relatively low energy X-rays. O X-rays are readily absorbed by 
other elements. Fortunately, many elements combine readily 
with oxygen in predictable ratios. For example, Si oxidizes to 
form SiO
</p>
<p>2
 and Al oxidizes to form Al
</p>
<p>2
O
</p>
<p>3
. Rather than mea-
</p>
<p>sure O directly, it is useful to compute the quantity of other 
elements from their k-ratios and then compute the amount of 
O it would take to fully oxidize these elements. This quantity 
of O is added in to the next estimated composition.
</p>
<p>NIST DTSA-II has a table of common elemental stoichi-
ometries for calculations that invoke assumed stoichiometry. 
For many elements, there may be more than one stable oxi-
dation state. For example, iron oxidizes to FeO (w&uuml;stite), 
Fe
</p>
<p>3
O
</p>
<p>4
 (magnetite), and Fe
</p>
<p>2
O
</p>
<p>3
 (hematite). All three forms 
</p>
<p>occur in natural minerals. The choice of oxidation state can 
be selected by the user, often relying upon independent 
information such as a crystallographic determination or 
based upon the most common oxidation state that is encoun-
tered in nature.
</p>
<p>The same basic concept can be applied to other elements 
which combine in predicable ratios.
</p>
<p>19.7.2  Waters of&nbsp;Crystallization
</p>
<p>Water of crystallization (also known as water of hydration or 
crystallization water) is water that occurs within crystals. 
Typically, water of crystallization is annotated by adding 
&ldquo;&middot;nH
</p>
<p>2
O&rdquo; to the end of the base chemical formula. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, CuSO
4
 &middot; 5H
</p>
<p>2
O is copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate. This 
</p>
<p>expression indicates that five molecules of water have been 
added to copper sulfate. Crystals may be fully hydrated or 
partially hydrated depending upon whether the maximum 
achievable number of water molecules are associated with 
each base molecule. CuSO
</p>
<p>4
 is partially hydrated if there are 
</p>
<p>fewer than five water molecules per CuSO
4
 molecule. Some 
</p>
<p>crystals hydrate in a humid environment. Hydration mole-
cules (water) can often be driven off by strong heating, and 
some hydrated materials undergo loss of water molecules 
due to electron beam damage.
</p>
<p>Measuring water of crystallization involves measuring O 
directly and comparing this measurement with the amount 
of water predicted by performing a stoichiometric calcula-
tion on the base molecule. Any surplus oxygen (oxygen mea-
sured but not accounted for by stoichiometry) is assumed to 
be in the form of water and two additional hydrogen atoms 
are added to each surplus oxygen atom. The resulting com-
position can be reported as the base molecule + &ldquo;&middot;nH
</p>
<p>2
O&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>where n is the relative number waters per base molecule.
</p>
<p>19.7.3  Element by Difference
</p>
<p>All matter consists of 100 % of some set of elements. If we 
were able to measure the mass fraction of N-1 of the N ele-
ments in a material with perfect accuracy then the mass frac-
tion of the Nth element would be the difference
</p>
<p>C C
N
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>i

<p>1
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>&aring;
 
</p>
<p>(19.7)
</p>
<p>Of course, we can&rsquo;t measure the N-1 elements with perfect 
accuracy, but we can apply the same concept to estimate the 
quantity of difficult to measure elements.
</p>
<p>This approach has numerous pitfalls. First, the uncer-
tainty in difference is the sum of the uncertainties for the 
mass fractions of the N-1 elements. This can be quite large 
particularly when N is large. Second, since we assume the 
total mass fraction sums to unity, there is no redundant check 
like the analytic total to validate the measurement.

<p>19.8.1  Mass Fraction
</p>
<p>The most common way to report the composition of a mate-
rial is in terms of the mass fraction. To understand the mass 
fraction, consider a block of material containing a mixture of 
different atoms. Weigh the block. Now imagine separating the 
block into distinct piles, each pile containing all the atoms 
from one element in the block. Weigh each of the separated 
piles. The mass fraction is calculated as the ratio of the mass of 
pile containing element Z over the total mass of the block. 
Since each element in the block is represented by a pile and 
since none of the atoms are lost in the process of dividing the 
block, the sum of mass fractions equals unity. Of course, we 
can&rsquo;t really do this measurement this way for most materials 
but conceptually we can understand mass fraction as though 
we can. As a simple example, consider the mineral pyrite, FeS
</p>
<p>2
. 
</p>
<p>The molecular formula combines one gram-mole of Fe (atomic 
weight A = 55.85&nbsp;g/mole) with two gram moles of S (A = 32.07&nbsp;g/
mole) for a compound molecular weight of 119.99&nbsp;g/mole. The 
mass fractions, C
</p>
<p>w
, of the constituents are thus
</p>
<p>C

</p>
<p>C
,Sw
=64 14 119 99 0 5345. / . .=  (19.8b)
</p>
<p>The mass fraction is the fundamental output of electron 
probe X-ray microanalysis measurements. All other output 
modes are calculated from the mass fraction.
</p>
<p>Weight fraction, mass percent, weight percent are all 
commonly seen synonyms for mass fractions. Mass fraction 
or mass percent is the preferred nomenclature because it is 
independent of local gravity.
</p>
<p>19.8.2  Atomic Fraction
</p>
<p>If we perform the same mental experiment as was described 
in the mass fraction section, but instead of weighing the piles, 
we instead count the number of atoms in the block and each 
of the piles. If we then calculate the ratio of the number of 
atoms of element Z relative to the total number of atoms in 
the block, this is the atomic fraction, C
</p>
<p>a
. For the example of 
</p>
<p>FeS
2
, which contains a total of three atoms in the molecular 
</p>
<p>formula, the atomic fractions are
</p>
<p>C

= =1 3 0 3333/ .  (19.9a)
</p>
<p>C
a,S
= =2 3 0 6667/ .  (19.9b)
</p>
<p>We can calculate atomic fraction C
a
 from mass fraction C
</p>
<p>w
 
</p>
<p>and vice versa using the atomic weights A of the elements.

</p>

</p>
<p>(19.10)
</p>
<p>Where N is the number of elements involved in the mixture.
</p>
<p>Starting with the atomic fractions, the mass fractions are 
calculated according to the formula

</p>
<p>a,i i

</p>
<p>(19.11)
</p>
<p>It is appropriate to use the atomic weights as suggested by 
the IUPAC (7 http://www.ciaaw.org/atomic_weights4.htm). 
These weights are based on assumed mixes of isotopes as 
are typically seen in terrestrial samples. Occasionally, when 
it is known that an element is present in a perturbed isoto-
pic mix, it may be appropriate to use this information to 
calculate a more accurate atomic weight. Since the atomic 
fraction depends upon assumed atomic weights, the atomic 
fraction is less fundamental than the mass fraction.
</p>
<p>19.8.3  Stoichiometry
</p>
<p>Stoichiometry is closely related to atomic fraction. Many 
materials can be described simply in terms of the chemical 
formula of its most basic constituent unit. For example, 
silicon and oxygen combine to form a material in which 
the most basic repeating element consists of SiO
</p>
<p>2
. 
</p>
<p>Stoichiometry can be readily translated into atomic frac-
tion. Since our measurements are imprecise, the stoichi-
ometry rarely works out in clean integral units. However, 
the measurement is often precise enough to distinguish 
between two or more valence states.
</p>
<p>19.8.4  Oxide Fractions
</p>
<p>Oxide fractions are closely related to stoichiometry. When a 
material such as a natural mineral is a mixture of oxides, it 
can make sense to report the composition as a linear sum of 
the oxide constituents by mass fraction.
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp;19.1 shows the analysis of NIST SRM470 (K412 
glass) with the results reported as oxide fraction, mass frac-
tion, and atomic fraction.

<p>19.9  The Accuracy of&nbsp;Quantitative Electron- 
Excited X-ray Microanalysis
</p>
<p>19.9.1  Standards-Based k-ratio Protocol
</p>
<p>Quantitative electron-excited X-ray microanalysis following 
the standards-based k-ratio protocol is a relative not an abso-
lute analysis method. The unknown is measured relative to 
standards of well known composition such as pure elements 
and stoichiometric compounds with fixed atom ratios, for 
example, FeS
</p>
<p>2
. The accuracy of the method can only be tested 
</p>
<p>by analyzing materials whose composition is known from 
independent (and ideally absolute) analysis methods and 
whose composition has been found to be homogeneous at 
the sub-micrometer scale. There are limited numbers of spe-
cial materials that fit these strict compositional requirements 
to qualify as certified reference materials for electron beam 
X-ray microanalysis, including certain metal alloys, interme-
tallic compounds, and glasses. Limited numbers of these 
materials are available from national standards institutions, 
such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(U.S.) (e.g., Marinenko et&nbsp; al. 1990) and the European 
Commission Community Bureau of Reference (e.g., Saunders 
et&nbsp;al. 2004). Certain mineral species have been characterized 
to serve as standards, which are of particular use to the geo-
chemistry community, by the Smithsonian Institution. These 
certified reference materials and related materials such as 
minerals can serve directly as standards for analyses, but 
their other important function is to serve as challenge mate-
rials to test the quantification methods. Additional materials 
suitable for testing the method include stoichiometric com-
pounds with formulae that define specific, unvarying com-
positions; that is, the same materials that can also be used as 
standards. Thus, FeS
</p>
<p>2
 could be used as an &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; for a 
</p>
<p>test analysis with Fe and CuS as the standards, while CuS 
could be analyzed with Cu and FeS
</p>
<p>2
 as standards. From such 
</p>
<p>analyses of certified reference materials and other test mate-
rials, the relative deviation from the expected value (RDEV) 
</p>
<p>(also referred to as &ldquo;relative error&rdquo;) is calculated with the 
&ldquo;expected&rdquo; value taken as the stoichiometric formula value or 
the value obtained from an &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; analytical method, 
such as gravimetric analysis:
</p>
<p>RDEV
Analyzed value expected value
</p>

&ecirc;
</p>
<p>&ugrave;
</p>
<p>&ucirc;
&uacute; 100%
</p>
<p> 
(19.14)
</p>
<p>Note that by this equation a positive RDEV indicates an overes-
timate of the concentration, while a negative RDEV indicates an 
underestimate. By analyzing many test materials spanning the 
periodic table and determining the relative deviation from the 
expected value (relative error), the analytical performance can be 
estimated. For example, early studies of quantitative electron 
probe microanalysis with wavelength dispersive X-ray spec-
trometry following the standards-based k-ratio protocol and 
ZAF matrix corrections produced a distribution of RDEV values 
(relative errors) such that 95 % of the analyses were captured in 
an RDEV (relative error) range of &plusmn;5 % relative, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;19.1 (Yakowitz 1975).
</p>
<p>Subsequent development and refinement of the matrix 
correction procedures by many researchers improved upon 
this level of accuracy. Pouchou and Pichoir (1991) described 
an advanced matrix correction model based upon extensive 
experimental measurements of the φ(ρz) description of the 
depth distribution of ionization. Incorporating explicit 
measurements for low energy photons, this approach has 
been especially successful for low photon energy X-rays 
which were subject to high absorption. A comparison of 
corrections of the same k-ratio dataset with their φ(ρz) 
method and with the conventional ZAF method showed sig-
nificant narrowing of the RDEV distribution and elimina-
tion of significant large RDEV values, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;19.2. 
With this improvement, approximately 95 % of analyses fall 
within &plusmn;2.5 % RDEV.

excited X-ray microanalysis with silicon drift detector (SDD)-

<p>protocol and PAP φ(ρz) matrix corrections with NIST 
DTSA-II.&nbsp; The level of accuracy achieved with this SDD-EDS 
approach fits within the RDEV histogram achieved with EPMA-
WDS for major, minor, and trace constituents, even when severe 
peak interference occurs. It should be noted that SDD-EDS is 
sufficiently stable with time that, providing a quality measure-
ment protocol is in place to ensure that all measurements are 
made under identical conditions of beam energy, known dose, 
specimen orientation, and SDD- EDS performance, archived 
standards can be used without significant loss of accuracy.
</p>
<p>19.9.2  &ldquo;Standardless Analysis&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Virtually all vendor analytical software includes the option 
for &ldquo;standardless analysis.&rdquo; Standardless analysis requires 
only the spectrum of the unknown, the list of elements iden-
tified during qualitative analysis, and the beam energy; and 
the software will report quantitative concentration values, 
including oxygen by assumed stoichiometry if desired. 
&ldquo;Standardless analysis&rdquo; is usually implemented as a &ldquo;black 
box&rdquo; tool without extensive documentation. The approach is 
the same as the standards-based analysis protocol: a k-ratio is 
the starting point, but the spectrum of the unknown only 
provides the numerator of the k-ratio. A &ldquo;first principles 
physics&rdquo; calculation of the standard intensity for the denomi-
nator of the k-ratio, while possible, is difficult because of the 
lack of accurate values of critical parameters in the equations 
for X-ray generation and propagation. Instead, the general 
approach employed throughout the EDS industry is the use 
of a library of remotely measured standards to provide the 
intensity for the denominator of the k-ratio. Pure element 
and binary compound standards are measured under defined 
conditions at several beam energies on a well characterized 
EDS.&nbsp;When standardless analysis is invoked, the appropriate 
elemental intensities are selected from this database of stan-
dards, and any missing elements not represented in the data-
base are supplied by interpolation aided by the physical 
equations of X-ray generation and propagation. If a beam 
energy is requested for which reference values are not avail-
able in the database, the equations of the physics of X-ray 
generation are used to appropriately adjust the available 
intensities. Usually a reference spectrum that is locally mea-
sured on a pure element, for example, Mn or Cu, is used to 
compare the efficiency of the EDS on a channel-by-channel 
basis to the vendor EDS that was originally used to measure 
the standards library. Because of its simplicity of operation, 
standardless analysis enjoys great popularity. Probably 95 % 
or more of quantitative EDS analyses are performed with the 
standardless analysis procedure. While it is useful and is con-
tinually being improved, standardless analysis is subject to a 
substantially wider RDEV distribution than standards-based 
analysis with locally measured standards. Standardless analy-
sis of a wide range of test materials produced the RDEV his-
togram shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 19.3 (Newbury et&nbsp; al. 1995). This 
distribution is such that 95 % of all analyses fall within a 
range of &plusmn;25 % relative. If this level of analytical accuracy is

<p>sufficient, then standardless analysis is an acceptable proce-
dure, providing this RDEV distribution, or a version appro-
priate to the standardless analysis software supplied by the 
vendor, is used to inform those who will make use of the 
quantitative analyses of the possible range of the results. 
While the standardless protocol may eventually equal the 
performance of standards-based analysis, recent results for 
current versions of standardless analysis, reported in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 19.4, suggest that a wide RDEV distribution is still 
being experienced, at least from some vendors.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that when 95 % of all analyses fall 
within a range of &plusmn;25 % relative, it may often not be possible 
to correctly determine the formula of the major constitu-
ents of a stoichiometric compound. An example of this sit-

<p>standards- based analysis, the formulae calculated from the 
standardless results do not match the proper formula.
</p>
<p>Another shortcoming of standardless analysis is the loss 
of the information on the dose and the absolute spectrometer 
efficiency that is automatically embedded in the standards- 
based k-ratio/matrix corrections protocol. Without the dose 
and absolute spectrometer efficiency information, standard-
less analysis results must inevitably be internally normalized 
to unity (100 %) so that the calculated concentrations have 
realistic meaning, thereby losing the very useful information 
present in the raw analytical total that is available in the 
standards- based k-ratio/matrix corrections protocol. It must 
be noted that standardless analysis results will always sum to 
unity, even if one or more constituents are not recognized 
during qualitative analysis or are inadvertently lost from the 
suite of elements being analyzed. If the local dose and spec-
trometer efficiency can be accurately scaled to the conditions 
used to record remote standards, then standardless analysis 
can determine a meaningful analytical total, but this is not 
commonly implemented in vendor software.

<p>19.10.1  The Need for&nbsp;Matrix Corrections 
To&nbsp;Achieve Quantitative Analysis
</p>
<p>There has long been confusion around the definition of the 
expression &lsquo;ZAF&rsquo; used to compensate for material differences 
in X-ray microanalysis measurements. There are two compet-
ing definitions. Neither is wrong and both exist in the literature 
and implemented in microanalysis software. However, the two 
definitions lead to numerical values of the matrix corrections 
that are related by being numerical inverses of each other.
</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s call these two definitions 
ZAF
</p>
<p>A
 and ZAF
</p>
<p>B
. In both definitions, k I I=
</p>
<p>unk std

<p>Upon initial examination, it would seem that quantitative 
analysis should be extremely simple. Just form the ratio of the 
characteristic X-ray intensity for a given element measured 
from the specimen to that measured from the standard, and 
that ratio should be equal to the ratio of concentrations for a 
given element between the specimen and the standard. As 
was first noted by Castaing (1951), the primary generated 
intensities are roughly proportional to the respective mass 
fractions of the emitting element. If other contributions to 
X-ray generation are very small, the measured intensity ratios 
between specimen and standard are roughly equal to the 
ratios of the mass or weight fractions of the emitting element. 
This assumption is often applied to X-ray quantitation and is 
called Castaing&rsquo;s &ldquo;first approximation to quantitative analy-
sis&rdquo; and is given by

and the ratio of concentrations. An example of these devia-
tions is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;19.5, which depicts the deviations of 
measured X-ray intensities in the iron-nickel binary system 
from the linear behavior predicted by the first approximation 
to quantitative analysis, Eq. (19.16). . Figure&nbsp;19.5 shows the

<p>respectively, relative to pure element standards. The straight 
lines plotted between pure Fe and pure Ni indicate the rela-
tionship between composition and intensity ratio given in 
Eq. (19.16). For Ni K-L
</p>
<p>3
, the actual data fall below the linear 
</p>
<p>first approximation and indicate that there is an X-ray 
absorption effect taking place, that is, more absorption in the 
sample than in the standard. For Fe K-L
</p>
<p>3
, the measured data 
</p>
<p>fall above the first approximation and indicate that there is a 
fluorescence effect taking place in the sample. In this alloy 
the Ni K-L
</p>
<p>3
 radiation is heavily absorbed by the iron and the 
</p>
<p>Fe K-L
3
 radiation is increased due to X-ray fluorescence by 
</p>
<p>the Ni K-L

 radiation over that generated by the bombarding 
</p>
<p>electrons.
These effects that cause deviations from the simple linear 
</p>
<p>behavior given by Eq. (19.16) are referred to as matrix or 
inter-element effects. As described in the following sections, 
the measured intensities from specimen and standard need 
to be corrected for differences in electron backscatter and 
energy loss, X-ray absorption along the path through the 
solid to reach the detector, and secondary X-ray generation 
and emission that follows absorption, in order to arrive at the 
ratio of generated intensities and hence the value of C
</p>
<p>i,unk
. The 
</p>
<p>magnitude of the matrix effects can be quite large, exceeding 
</p>
<p>factors of ten or more in certain systems. Recognition of the 
complexity of the problem of the analysis of solid samples has 
led numerous investigators to develop the theoretical treat-
ment of the quantitative analysis scheme, first proposed by 
Castaing (1951).
</p>
<p>19.10.2  The Physical Origin of&nbsp;Matrix Effects
</p>
<p>What is the origin of these matrix effects? The X-ray intensity 
generated for each element in the specimen is proportional to 
the concentration of that element, the probability of X-ray 
production (ionization cross section) for that element, the 
path length of the electrons in the specimen, and the fraction 
of incident electrons which remain in the specimen and are 
not backscattered. It is very difficult to calculate the absolute 
generated intensity for the elements present in a specimen 
directly. Moreover, the intensity that the analyst must deal 
with is the measured intensity. The measured intensity is even 
more difficult to calculate, particularly because absorption 
and fluorescence of the generated X-rays may occur in the 
specimen, thus further modifying the measured X-ray inten-
sity from that predicted on the basis of the ionization cross 
section alone. Instrumental factors such as differing spec-
trometer efficiency as a function of X-ray energy must also be 
considered. Many of these factors are dependent on the 
atomic species involved. Thus, in mixtures of elements, 
matrix effects arise because of differences in elastic and 
inelastic scattering processes and in the propagation of 
X-rays through the specimen to reach the detector. For con-
ceptual as well as calculational reasons, it is convenient to 
divide the matrix effects into atomic number, Z
</p>
<p>i
; X-ray 
</p>
<p>absorption, A
i
; and X-ray fluorescence, F
</p>
<p>i
, effects.
</p>
<p>Using these matrix effects, the most common form of the 
correction equation is
</p>
<p>C C ZAF k
i unk i std i i ii,unk i,std
</p>
<p>ZAF [ I  /I ]
, ,
/ .== =[ ] [ ]
</p>
<p> 
(19.17)
</p>
<p>where C
i,unk
</p>
<p> is the weight fraction of the element of interest in 
the unknown and C
</p>
<p>i,std
 is the weight fraction of i in the stan-
</p>
<p>dard. This equation must be applied separately for each ele-
ment present in the sample. Equation (19.17) is used to 
express the matrix effects and is the common basis for X-ray 
microanalysis in the SEM/EPMA.
</p>
<p>It is important for the analyst to develop a good idea of 
the origin and the importance of each of the three major 
non-linear effects on X-ray measurement for quantitative 
analysis of a large range of specimens.
</p>
<p>19.10.3  ZAF Factors in&nbsp;Microanalysis
</p>
<p>The matrix effects Z, A, and F all contribute to the correction 
for X-ray analysis as given in Eq. (19.17). This section dis-
cusses each of the matrix effects individually. The combined 
effect of ZAF determines the total matrix correction.

<p> Atomic Number Effect, Z (Effect 
of&nbsp;Backscattering [R] and&nbsp;Energy Loss [S])
</p>
<p>One approach to the atomic number effect is to consider 
directly the two different factors, backscattering (R) and 
stopping power (S), which determine the amount of gener-
ated X-ray intensity in an unknown. Dividing the stopping 
power, S, for the unknown and standard by the backscatter-
ing term, R, for the unknown and standard yields the atomic 
number matrix factor, Z
</p>
<p>i
, for each element, i, in the unknown. 
</p>
<p>A discussion of the R and S factors follows.
Backscattering, R: The process of elastic scattering in a 
</p>
<p>solid sample leads to backscattering which results in the 
premature loss of a significant fraction of the beam elec-
trons from the target before all of the ionizing power of 
those electrons has been expended generating X-rays of the 
various elemental constituents. From . Fig. 2.3a, which 
depicts the backscattering coefficient as a function of atomic 
number, this effect is seen to be strong, particularly if the 
elements involved in the unknown and standard have widely 
differing atomic numbers. For example, consider the analy-
sis of a minor constituent, for example, 1 weight %, of alu-
minum in gold, against a pure aluminum standard. In the 
aluminum standard, the backscattering coefficient is about 
15 % at a beam energy of 20&nbsp;keV, while for gold the value is 
about 50 %. When aluminum is measured as a standard, 
about 85 % of the beam electrons completely expend their 
energy in the target, making the maximum amount of Al 
K-L
</p>
<p>3
 X-rays. In gold, only 50 % are stopped in the target, so 
</p>
<p>by this effect, aluminum dispersed in gold is actually under 
represented in the X-rays generated in the specimen relative 
to the pure aluminum standard. The energy distribution of 
backscattered electrons further exacerbates this effect. Not 
only are more electrons backscattered from high atomic 
number targets, but as shown in . Fig. 2.16a, b, the back-
scattered electrons from high atomic number targets carry 
off a higher fraction of their incident energy, further reduc-
ing the energy available for ionization of inner shells. The 
integrated effects of backscattering and the backscattered 
electron energy distribution form the basis of the &ldquo;R-factor&rdquo; 
in the atomic number correction of the &ldquo;ZAF&rdquo; formulation 
of matrix corrections.
</p>
<p>Stopping power, S: The rate of energy loss due to inelastic 
scattering also depends strongly on the atomic number. For 
quantitative X-ray calculations, the concept of the stopping 
power, S, of the target is used. S is the rate of energy loss given 
by the Bethe continuous energy loss approximation, Eq. (1.1), 
divided by the density, ρ, giving S = &minus; (1/ρ)(dE/ds). Using the 
Bethe formulation for the rate of energy loss (dE/ds), one 
observes that the stopping power is a decreasing function of 
atomic number. The low atomic number targets actually 
remove energy from the beam electron more rapidly with 
mass depth (ρz), the product of the density of the sample (ρ), 
and the depth dimension (z) than high atomic number tar-
gets.
</p>
<p>An example of the importance of the atomic number 
effect is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;19.6. This figure shows the measure-
ment of the intensity ratio k
</p>
<p>Au
 and k

 for four well-characterized homogeneous Au-Cu stan-
</p>
<p>dards (Heinrich et&nbsp;al. 1971). The data were taken at an initial 
electron beam energy of 15&nbsp;keV and a take-off angle of 52.5&deg;, 
and pure Au and pure Cu were used as standards. The atomic 
number difference between these two elements is 50. The 
straight lines plotted on . Fig.&nbsp; 19.6 between pure Au and 
pure Cu indicate the relationship between composition and 
intensity ratio given in Eq. (19.17). For both Au L-M and Cu 
K-L
</p>
<p>3
, the absorption matrix effect, A
</p>
<p>i
, is less than 1 %, and the 
</p>
<p>fluorescence matrix effect, F
i
, is less than 2 %. For Cu K-L
</p>
<p>3
, 
</p>
<p>the measured data fall above the first approximation and 
almost all the deviation is due to the atomic number effect, 
the difference in atomic number between the Au-Cu alloy 
and the Cu standard. As an example, for the 40.1&nbsp; wt% Au 
specimen, the atomic number matrix factor, Z
</p>
<p>Cu
, is 1.12, an 
</p>
<p>increase in the Cu K-L
3
 intensity by 12 %. For Au L-M, the 
</p>
<p>measured data fall below Castaing&lsquo;s first approximation and 
almost all the deviation is due to the atomic number effect. 
As an example, for the 40.1&nbsp;wt % Au specimen, the atomic 
number effect, Z
</p>
<p>Au
, is 0.806, a decrease in the Au L-M 
</p>
<p> intensity by 20 %. In this example, the S factor is larger and 
the R factor is smaller for the Cu K-L
</p>
<p>3
 X-rays leading to a 
</p>
<p>larger S/R ratio and hence a larger Z
Cu
</p>
<p> effect. Just the oppo-
site is true for the Au L-M X-rays leading to a smaller Z
</p>
<p>Au
 
</p>
<p>effect. The effects of R and S tend to go in opposite directions 
and to cancel.
</p>
<p>X-ray Generation With&nbsp;Depth, φ(ρz)
</p>
<p>A second approach to calculating the atomic number effect is 
to determine the X-ray generation in depth as a function of 
atomic number and electron beam energy. As shown in 
7 Chapters 1, 2, and 4, the paths of beam electrons within the 
specimen can be represented by Monte Carlo simulations of 
electron trajectories. In the Monte Carlo simulation tech-

<p>nique, the detailed history of an electron trajectory is calcu-
lated in a stepwise manner. At each point along the trajectory, 
both elastic and inelastic scattering events can occur. The 
production of characteristic X-rays, an inelastic scattering 
process, can occur along the path of an electron as long as the 
energy E of the electron is above the critical excitation energy, 
E
</p>
<p>c
, of the characteristic X-ray of interest.
. Figure&nbsp; 19.7 displays Monte Carlo simulations of the 
</p>
<p>positions where K-shell X-ray interactions occur for three 
elements, Al, Ti, and Cu, using an initial electron energy, E
</p>
<p>0
, 
</p>
<p>of 15&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;The incoming electron beam is assumed to have a 
zero width and to impact normal to the sample surface. X-ray 
generation occurs in the lateral directions, x and y, and in 
depth dimension, z. The micrometer marker gives the dis-
tance in both the x and z dimensions. Each dot indicates the 
generation of an X-ray; the dense regions indicate that a large 
number of X-rays are generated. This figure shows that the 
X-ray generation volume decreases with increasing atomic 
number (Al, Z = 13; Ti, Z = 22; Cu, Z = 29) for the same initial 
electron energy. The decrease in X-ray generation volume is 
due to (1) an increase in elastic scattering with atomic num-
ber, which deviates the electron path from the initial beam 
direction; and (2) an increase in critical excitation energy, E
</p>
<p>c
, 
</p>
<p>that gives a corresponding decrease in overvoltage U 
(U = E
</p>
<p>0
/E
</p>
<p>c
) with atomic number. This decreases the fraction 
</p>
<p>of the initial electron energy available for the production of 
</p>
<p>characteristic X-rays. A decrease in overvoltage, U, decreases 
the energy range over which X-rays can be produced.
</p>
<p>One can observe from . Fig.&nbsp;19.7 that there is a non-even 
distribution of X-ray generation with depth, z, for specimens 
with various atomic numbers and initial electron beam ener-
gies. This variation is illustrated by the histograms on the left 
side of the Monte Carlo simulations. These histograms plot the 
number of X-rays generated with depth into the specimen. In 
detail the X-ray generation for most specimens is somewhat 
higher just below the surface of the specimen and decreases to 
zero when the electron energy, E, falls below the critical excita-
tion energy, E
</p>
<p>c
, of the characteristic X-ray of interest.
</p>
<p>As illustrated from the Monte Carlo simulations, the 
atomic number of the specimen strongly affects the distribu-
tion of X-rays generated in specimens. These effects are even 
more complex when considering more interesting multi- 
element samples as well as the generation of L and M shell 
X-ray radiation.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;19.7 clearly shows that X-ray generation varies 
with depth as well as with specimen atomic number. In prac-
tice it is very difficult to measure or calculate an absolute 
value for the X-ray intensity generated with depth. Therefore, 
we follow the practice first suggested by Castaing (1951) of 
using a relative or a normalized generated intensity which 
varies with depth, called φ (ρz). The term ρz is called the 
mass depth and is the product of the density ρ of the sample

<p>(g/cm3) and the linear depth dimension, z (cm), so that the 
product ρz has units of g/cm2. The mass depth, ρz, is more 
commonly used than the depth term, z. The use of the mass 
depth removes the strong variable of density when compar-
ing specimens of different atomic number. Therefore it is 
important to recognize the difference between the two terms 
as the discussion of X-ray generation proceeds.
</p>
<p>The general shape of the depth distribution of the gener-
ated X-rays, the φ (ρz) versus ρz curve, is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;19.8. 
The amount of X-ray production in any layer of the histogram 
is related to the amount of elastic scattering, the initial elec-
tron beam energy, and the energy of the characteristic X-ray 
of interest. The intensity in any layer of the φ (ρz) versus ρz 
curve is normalized to the intensity generated in an ideal thin 
layer, where &ldquo;thin&rdquo; is a thickness such that effectively no 
significant elastic scattering occurs and the incident electrons 
pass through perpendicular to the layer. As the incident beam 
penetrates the layers of material in depth, the length of the 
trajectory in each successive layer increases because (1) elastic 
scattering deviates the beam electrons out of the straight line 
path, which was initially parallel to the surface normal, thus 
requiring a longer path to cross the layer and (2) backscatter-
ing results in electrons, which were scattered deeper in the 
specimen, crossing the layer in the opposite direction follow-
ing a continuous range of angles relative to the surface nor-
mal. Due to these factors, X-ray production increases with 
depth from the surface, ρz = 0, and goes through a peak, φ
</p>
<p>m
, at 
</p>
<p>a certain depth ρR
m
</p>
<p> (see . Fig.&nbsp;19.8). Another consequence of 
backscattering is that surface layer production, φ
</p>
<p>0
, is larger 
</p>
<p>than 1.0&nbsp;in solid samples because the backscattered electrons 
excite X-rays as they pass through the surface layer and leave 
the sample, adding to the intensity created by all of the inci-
</p>
<p>dent beam electrons that passed through the surface layer. 
After the depth ρR
</p>
<p>m
, X-ray production begins to decrease 
</p>
<p>with depth because the backscattering of the beam electrons 
reduces the number of electrons available at increasing depth 
ρz and the remaining electrons lose energy and therefore ion-
izing power as they scatter at increasing depths. Finally X-ray 
production goes to zero at ρz = ρRx where the energy of the 
beam electrons no longer exceeds E
</p>
<p>c
.
</p>
<p>Now that we have discussed and described the depth dis-
tribution of the production of X-rays using the φ(ρz) versus 
ρz curves, it is important to understand how these curves dif-
fer with the type of specimen that is analyzed and the operat-
ing conditions of the instrument. The specimen and operating 
conditions that are most important in this regard are the aver-
age atomic number, Z, of the specimen and the initial electron 
beam energy, E

 chosen for the analysis. Calculations of φ(ρz) 
</p>
<p>versus ρz curves have been made for this Appendix using the 
PROZA program (Bastin and Heijligers 1990). In . Fig.&nbsp;19.9, 
the φ(ρz) versus ρz curves for the K-L
</p>
<p>3
 X-rays of pure Al, Ti, 
</p>
<p>and Cu specimens at 15&nbsp;keV are displayed. The shapes of the 
φ(ρz) versus ρz curves are quite different. The φ
</p>
<p>0
 values, rela-
</p>
<p>tive to the value of φm for each curve, increase from Al to Cu 
due to increased backscattering which produces additional 
X-ray radiation. On an absolute basis, the φ
</p>
<p>0
 value for Cu is 
</p>
<p>smaller than the value for Ti because the overvoltage, U
0
, for 
</p>
<p>the Cu K-L
3
 X-ray at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 15&nbsp;keV is low (U
</p>
<p>0
 = 1.67) and the 
</p>
<p>energy of many of the backscattered electrons is not sufficient 
to excite Cu K-L
</p>
<p>3
 X-rays near the surface. The values of ρR
</p>
<p>m
 
</p>
<p>and ρR
x
 decrease with increasing Z and a smaller X-ray exci-
</p>
<p>tation volume is produced. This decrease would be much 
more evident if we plotted φ(ρz) versus z, the linear depth of 
X-ray excitation, since the use of mass depth includes the 
density, which changes significantly from Al to Cu.

<p>curve in the alloy is smaller than that of pure Cu because the 
average atomic number of the Al&nbsp;&ndash; 3&nbsp;wt % Cu sample is so 
much lower, almost the same as pure Al. In this case, less back-
scattering of the primary high energy electron beam occurs 
and fewer Cu K-L
</p>
<p>3
 X-rays are generated. On the other hand 
</p>
<p>the Al K-L
3
 φ(ρz) curves for the alloy and the pure element are 
</p>
<p>essentially the same since the average atomic number of the 
specimen is so close to that of pure Al. Although the variation 
of φ(ρz) curves with atomic number and initial operating 
energy is complex, a knowledge of the pertinent X-ray genera-
tion curves is critical to understanding what is happening in 
the specimen and the standard for the element of interest.
</p>
<p>The generated characteristic X-ray intensity, I
i
 gen, for 
</p>
<p>each element, i, in the specimen can be obtained by taking 
the area under the φ(ρz) versus ρz curve, that is, by sum-
ming the values of φ(ρz) for all the layers Δ(ρz) in mass 
thickness within the specimen for the X-ray of interest. We 
will call this area &ldquo;φ(ρz)i,

</p>
<p>shows that about 17 % fewer Cu K-L
3
 X-rays are generated 
</p>
<p>in the alloy. The latter variation is due to the different atomic 
numbers of the pure Cu and the Al&nbsp;&ndash; 3&nbsp;wt% Cu alloy speci-
men. The different atomic number matrices cause a change 
in φ
</p>
<p>0
 (see . Table&nbsp;19.3) and the height of the φ(ρz) curves.

 respectively. The val-

<p>ues of the calculated ratios of generated X-ray intensities, 
pure element standard to specimen (Atomic number effect, 
Z
</p>
<p>Al
, Z
</p>
<p>Cu
) are also given in . Table&nbsp;19.3 As discussed above, it 
</p>
<p>is expected that the atomic number correction for a heavy 
element (Cu) in a light element matrix (Al&nbsp;&ndash; 3&nbsp;wt % Cu) is 
</p>
<p>less than 1.0 and the atomic number correction for a light 
element (Al) in a heavy element matrix (Al&nbsp;&ndash; 3&nbsp;wt % Cu) is 
greater than 1.0. The calculated data in . Table&nbsp; 19.3 also 
show this relationship.
</p>
<p>In summary, the atomic number matrix correction, Z
i
, is 
</p>
<p>equal to the ratio of Z
i,std
</p>
<p> in the standard to Z
i,unk
</p>
<p> in the 
unknown. Using appropriate φ(ρz) curves, correction Z
</p>
<p>i
 can 
</p>
<p>be calculated by taking the ratio of I
gen,std
</p>
<p> for the standard to 
I
</p>
<p>gen,unk
 for the unknown for each element, i, in the sample. It 
</p>
<p>is important to note that the φ(ρz) curves for multi-element 
samples and elemental standards which can be used for the 
calculation of the atomic number effect inherently contain 
the R and S factors discussed previously.
</p>
<p> X-ray Absorption Effect, A
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;19.11 illustrates the effect of varying the initial elec-
tron beam energy using Monte Carlo simulations on the 
positions where K-shell X-ray generation occurs for Cu at 
three initial electron energies, 10, 20, and 30&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;This figure 
shows that the Cu characteristic X-rays are generated deeper 
in the specimen and the X-ray generation volume becomes 
larger as E
</p>
<p>0
 increases. From these plots, we can see that the 
</p>
<p>sites of inner shell ionizations which give rise to characteris-
tic X-rays are created over a range of depth below the surface 
of the specimen.
</p>
<p>Created over a range of depth, the X-rays will have to pass 
through a certain amount of matter to reach the detector, and 
as explained in 7 Chapter 4 (X-rays), the photoelectric 
absorption process will decrease the intensity. It is important 
to realize that the X-ray photons are either absorbed or else 
they pass through the specimen with their original energy 
unchanged, so that they are still characteristic of the atoms 
which emitted the X-rays. Absorption follows an exponential 
law, so as X-rays are generated deeper in the specimen, a pro-
gressively greater fraction is lost to absorption.
</p>
<p>From the Monte Carlo plots of . Fig.&nbsp;19.11, one recognizes 
that the depth distribution of ionization is a complicated func-
tion. To quantitatively calculate the effect of X-ray absorption, 
an accurate description of the X-ray distribution in depth is

<p>needed. Fortunately, the complex three- dimensional dis-
tribution can be reduced to a one- dimensional problem for 
the calculation of absorption, since the path out of the speci-
men towards the X-ray detector only depends on depth. The 
φ(ρz) curves discussed previously give the generated X-ray 
distribution of X-rays in depth (See . Figs.&nbsp; 19.8, 19.9, and 
19.10). . Figure&nbsp;19.12 shows calculated φ(ρz) curves for Cu 
K-L
</p>
<p>3
 X-rays in pure Cu for initial beam energies of 10, 15, and 
</p>
<p>30&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;The curves extend deeper (in mass depth or depth) in 
the sample with increasing E
</p>
<p>0
. The φ
</p>
<p>0
 values also increase with 
</p>
<p>increasing initial electron beam energies since the energy of 
the backscattered electrons increases with higher values of E
</p>
<p>0
.
</p>
<p>The X-rays which escape from any depth can be found 
by placing the appropriate path length in the X-ray absorp-
tion equation for the ratio of the measured X-ray intensity, 
I, to the generated X-ray intensity at some position in the 
sample, I

</p>
<p>The terms in the absorption equation are (μ/ρ), the mass 
absorption coefficient; ρ, the specimen density; and t, the 
path length (PL) that the X-ray traverses within the speci-
men before it reaches the surface, z = ρz = 0. For the purpose 
of our interests, I represents the X-ray intensity which leaves 
the surface of the sample and I
</p>
<p>0
 represents the X-ray inten-
</p>
<p>sity generated at some position within the X-ray generation 
volume. Since the X-ray spectrometer is usually placed at an 
acute angle from the specimen surface, the so-called take-off 
angle, ψ, the path length from a given depth z is given by 
PL = z csc ψ, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;19.13. When this correction

<p>3
 at an ini-
</p>
<p>tial electron beam energy of 15&nbsp; keV (calculated using the 
PROZA program (Bastin and Heijligers 1990, 1991)) is 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;19.14 for a trace amount (0.1&nbsp;wt%) of Al in a 
pure copper matrix. The area under the φ(ρz) curve repre-
sents the X-ray intensity. The difference in the integrated 
area between the generated and emitted φ(ρz) curves repre-
sents the total X-ray loss due to absorption. The absorption 
correction factor in quantitative matrix corrections is calcu-
lated on the basis of the φ(ρz) distribution. . Figure&nbsp;19.5, for 
example, illustrates the large amount of Ni K-L
</p>
<p>3
 absorbed in 
</p>
<p>the Fe-Ni alloy series as a function of composition.
X-ray absorption is usually the largest correction factor 
</p>
<p>that must be considered in the measurement of elemental 
composition by electron-excited X-ray microanalysis. For a 
given X-ray path length, the mass absorption coefficient, 
(μ/ρ), for each measured characteristic X-ray peak controls 
the amount of absorption. The value of (μ/ρ) varies greatly 
from one X-ray to another and is dependent on the matrix 
elements of the specimen (see 7 Chapter 4, &ldquo;X-rays&rdquo;). For 
example, the mass absorption coefficient for Fe K-L
</p>
<p>3
 radia-
</p>
<p>tion in Ni is 90.0&nbsp; cm2/g, while the mass absorption coeffi-
cient for Al K-L
</p>
<p>3
 radiation in Ni is 4837&nbsp; cm2/g. Using Eq. 
</p>
<p>(19.18) and a nominal path length of 1&nbsp;μm in a Ni sample 
containing small amounts of Fe and Al, the ratio of X-rays 
emitted at the sample surface to the X-rays generated in the 
sample, I/I
</p>
<p>0
, is 0.923 for Fe K-L
</p>
<p>3
 radiation but only 0.0135 for 
</p>
<p>Al K-L
3
 radiation. In this example, Al K-L
</p>
<p>3
 radiation is very 
</p>
<p>heavily absorbed with respect to Fe K-L
3
 radiation in the Ni 
</p>
<p>sample. Such a large amount of absorption must be taken 
account of in any quantitative X-ray analysis scheme. Even 
more serious effects of absorption occur when considering 
</p>
<p>the measurement of the light elements, for example, Be, B, C, 
N, O, and so on. For example, the mass absorption coeffi-
cient for C K-L radiation in Ni is 17,270&nbsp;cm2/g, so large that 
in most practical analyses, no C K-L radiation can be mea-
sured if the absorption path length is 1&nbsp; μm. Significant 
amounts of C K-L radiation can only be measured in a Ni 
sample within 0.1&nbsp;μm of the surface. In such an analysis situ-
ation, the initial electron beam energy should be held below 
10&nbsp;keV so that the C K-L X-ray source is produced close to 
the sample surface.
</p>
<p>As shown in . Fig.&nbsp;19.12, X-rays are generated up to sev-
eral micrometers into the specimen. Therefore the X-ray 
path length (PL = t) and the relative amount of X-rays avail-
able to the X-ray detection system after absorption (I/I
</p>
<p>0
) 
</p>
<p>vary with the depth at which each X-ray is generated in the 
specimen. In addition to the position, ρz or z, at which a 
given X-ray is generated within the specimen, the relation 
of that depth to the X-ray detector is also important since a 
combination of both factors determine the X-ray path 
length for absorption. . Figure&nbsp;19.15 shows the geometrical 
relationship between the position at which an X-ray is gen-
erated and the position of the collimator which allows 
X-rays into the EDS detector. If the specimen is normal to 
the electron beam (. Fig.&nbsp; 19.15), the angle between the 
specimen surface and the direction of the X-rays into the 
detector is the take-off angle ψ. The path length, t = PL, over 
which X-rays can be absorbed in the sample is calculated by 
multiplying the depth in the specimen, z, where the X-ray is 
generated, by the cosecant (the reciprocal of the sine), of the 
take-off angle, ψ. A larger take- off angle will yield a shorter 
path length in the specimen and will minimize absorption. 
The path length can be further minimized by decreasing the 
depth of X-ray generation, R

<p>3
 X-rays in Al from 
</p>
<p>10 to 30&nbsp;keV and the take-off angle, ψ = 15&deg; and ψ = 60&deg;.
The variation in PL is larger than a factor of 20, from 
</p>
<p>0.35&nbsp; μm at the lowest keV and highest take-off angle to 
7.7&nbsp;μm at the highest keV and lowest take-off angle. Clearly 
the analyst&rsquo;s choices of the initial electron beam energy and 
the X-ray take-off angle have a major effect on the path length 
and therefore the amount of absorption that occurs.
</p>
<p>In summary, using appropriate formulations for X-ray 
generation with depth or φ(ρz) curves, the effect of absorp-
tion can be obtained by considering absorption of X-rays 
from element i as they leave the sample. The absorption cor-
rection, A
</p>
<p>i
, can be calculated by taking the ratio of the effect of 
</p>
<p>absorption for the standard, A
i,std
</p>
<p>, to X-ray absorption for the 
unknown, A
</p>
<p>i,unk
, for each element, i, in the sample. The effect 
</p>
<p>of absorption can be minimized by decreasing the path length 
of the X-rays in the specimen through careful choice of the 
initial beam energy and by selecting, when possible, a high 
take-off angle.
</p>
<p> X-ray Fluorescence, F
</p>
<p>Photoelectric absorption results in the ionization of inner 
atomic shells, and those ionizations can also cause the emis-
sion of characteristic X-rays. For fluorescence to occur, an 
atom species must be present in the target which has a critical 
excitation energy less than the energy of the characteristic 
X-rays being absorbed. In such a case, the measured X-ray 
intensity from this second element will include both the 
direct electron-excited intensity as well as the additional 
intensity generated by the fluorescence effect. Generally, the 
fluorescence effect can be ignored unless the photon energy is 
less than 5&nbsp;keV greater than the critical excitation energy, E
</p>
<p>c
.
</p>
<p>The significance of the fluorescence correction, F
i
, can be 
</p>
<p>illustrated by considering the binary system Fe-Ni. In this sys-
tem, the Ni K-L
</p>
<p>3
 characteristic energy at 7.478&nbsp;keV is greater 
</p>
<p>than the energy for excitation of Fe K radiation, 
E
</p>
<p>c
 = 7.11&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;Therefore, an additional amount of Fe K-L
</p>
<p>3
 radi-
</p>
<p>ation is produced beyond that due to the direct beam on Fe. 
. Figure&nbsp;19.5 shows the effect of fluorescence in the Fe-Ni sys-
tem at an initial electron beam energy of 30&nbsp;keV and a take-off 
angle, ψ, of 52.5&deg;. Under these conditions, the atomic number 
effect, Z
</p>
<p>Fe
, and the absorption effect, A
</p>
<p>Fe
, for Fe K-L
</p>
<p>3
 are very 
</p>
<p>close to 1.0. The measured k
Fe
</p>
<p> ratio lies well above the first 
approximation straight line relationship. The additional inten-
sity is given by the effect of fluorescence. As an example, for a 
10&nbsp;wt% Fe&nbsp;&ndash; 90&nbsp;wt% Ni alloy, the amount of iron fluorescence 
is about 25 %.
</p>
<p>The quantitative calculation of the fluorescence effect 
requires a knowledge of the depth distribution over which the 
characteristic X-rays are absorbed. The φ(ρz) curve of elec-
tron-generated X-rays is the starting point for the fluorescence 
calculation, and a new φ(ρz) curve for X-ray- generated X-rays 
is determined. The electron-generated X-rays are emitted iso-
tropically. From the X-ray intensity generated in each of the 
layers Δ(ρz) of the φ(ρz) distribution, the calculation next 
considers the propagation of that radiation over a spherical 
volume centered on the depth ρz of that layer, calculating the 
absorption based on the radial distance from the starting layer 
and determining the contributions of absorption to each layer 
(ρz) in the X-ray-induced φ(ρz) distribution. Because of the 
longer range of X-rays than electrons in materials, the X-ray-
induced φ(ρz) distribution covers a much greater depth, gen-
erally an order of magnitude or more than the electron-induced

ment which causes fluorescence may be small. Of the three 
effects, Z, A, and F, which control X-ray microanalysis calcu-
lations, the fluorescence effect, Fi, can be calculated (Reed 
1965), with sufficient accuracy so that it rarely limits the 
development of an accurate analysis.

<p>This chapter discusses the procedure used to perform a rig-
orous quantitative elemental microanalysis by SEM/EDS 
following the k-ratio/matrix correction protocol using the 
NIST DTSA-II software engine for bulk specimens. Bulk 
specimens have dimensions that are sufficiently large to 
contain the full range of the direct electron-excited X-ray 
production (typically 0.5&ndash;10&nbsp;μm) as well as the range of 
secondary X-ray fluorescence induced by the propagation 
of the characteristic and continuum X-rays (typically 
10&ndash;100&nbsp;μm).
</p>
<p>20.1  Requirements Imposed 
on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Specimen and&nbsp;Standards
</p>
<p>The k-ratio/matrix correction protocol for the analysis of 
bulk specimens has two basic underlying assumptions:
 1. The composition is homogeneous throughout the entire 
</p>
<p>volume of the specimen in which primary characteristic 
X-rays are directly excited by the incident electron&nbsp;beam 
and in which secondary X-ray fluorescence is&nbsp;induced 
during the propagation of the primary characteristic 
and continuum X-rays. A compositionally heteroge-
neous specimen which does not satisfy this requirement 
cannot be analyzed by the conventional k-ratio/matrix 
correction protocol. Examples of such heterogeneous 
specimens include a horizontally layered specimen such 
as a thin film on a substrate or an inclusion with dimen-
sions similar to the interaction volume embedded in a 
matrix. Such specimens must be analyzed with protocols 
that account for the effects of the particular specimen 
geometry.
</p>
<p> 2. The X-ray intensities measured on the location of 
interest on the specimen and on the standard(s) differ 
only because the compositions are different. No other 
factors modify the measured intensities. In particular, 
geometric effects that arise from physical surface 
defects, such as scratches, pits, and so on, can modify 
the interaction of the electron beam (electron back-
scattering, beam penetration) with the specimen and 
can alter the subsequent X-ray absorption path length 
to the detector compared to an ideal flat bulk speci-
men. This requirement places strict conditions on the 
surface condition of the specimen and standards. A 
highly polished, flat surface must be created following 
the appropriate metallographic preparation proto-
col for each particular material. The surface should 
be finished to a surface roughness below 100&nbsp;nm 
root mean square (rms) with a typical final polish 
performed with 100-nm diamond, alumina, ceria 
or other polishing compound as appropriate. When 
the analysis involves measuring low energy photons 
below 1&nbsp;keV (e.g., for the elements Be, B, C, N, O, 
and F), the surface finish should be better than 50&nbsp;nm 
rms. The preparation protocol should utilize physical 
</p>
<p>grinding and polishing. &ldquo;Chemical polishing&rdquo; should 
be avoided since chemical reactions may induce shal-
low, near-surface compositional changes that affect 
the very shallow region that is excited and sampled 
by the electron beam. Ion beam milling can be used 
to shape and finish the specimen, but it must be 
recognized that implantation of the primary ion and 
differential material removal caused by differences in 
the sputtering rates of the elements can modify the 
composition of a shallow surface layer.
</p>
<p>20.2  Instrumentation Requirements
</p>
<p>The basis of the k-ratio/matrix corrections protocol is mea-
surement of the X-ray spectra of the specimen and standard 
(s) under identical conditions of beam energy, known elec-
tron dose (the product of beam current and EDS live-time, 
with accurate dead-time correction), EDS parameters 
(detector solid angle, time constant, calibration, and window 
efficiency), target orientation (tilt angle, ideally 0&deg; tilt, i.e., 
beam perpendicular to the target surface), and EDS take-off 
angle (i.e., the detector elevation angle above the flat sample 
surface).
</p>
<p>20.2.1  Choosing the&nbsp;EDS Parameters
</p>
<p>Consistency in the choice of the EDS parameters is critical 
for establishing a robust analytical measurement environ-
ment, and this is especially important when archived stan-
dard spectra are used.
</p>
<p> EDS Spectrum Channel Energy Width 
and&nbsp;Spectrum Energy Span
</p>
<p>As shown in . Fig.&nbsp;20.1, when the energy axis is expanded 
sufficiently, the EDS spectrum is seen to be a histogram of 
energy channels of a specific width (e.g., 5&nbsp; eV, 10&nbsp; eV, 
20&nbsp;eV) and number (e.g., 1024, 2048, 4096). For accurate 
peak- fitting purposes, it is desirable to have an adequate 
number of channels spanning the characteristic X-ray 
peaks. Because the EDS resolution is a function of photon 
energy, low photon energy peaks below 1&nbsp;keV are substan-
tially narrower than higher energy peaks. A choice of 5&nbsp;eV 
for the channel energy width will provide a sufficient num-
ber of channels to adequately span all of the peaks of ana-
lytical interest, including the peaks that occur below 
1&nbsp; keV.&nbsp; C K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 is broadened in EDS to approximately 
</p>
<p>50&nbsp;eV full width at half-maximum (FWHM), so a choice of 
5-eV/channel will provide at least 10 channels to span the 
low photon energy peaks, which is important for accurate 
peak fitting. It is also desirable for the measured spectrum 
to span the full range of the excited X-ray energy, from an 
effective threshold of approximately 100&nbsp;eV to the Duane&ndash;
Hunt limit, which corresponds to the incident beam

</p>
<p>energy, E
0
. The energy span is given by the channel width 
</p>
<p>multiplied by the number of channels. With a 5-eV chan-
nel width, a choice of 4096 channels will provide access to 
photon energies as high as 20.48&nbsp; keV.&nbsp; For beam energy 
above 20&nbsp;keV, the number of channels should be increased 
to retain the 5-eV channel width, or alternatively the chan-
nel width can be increased to 10&nbsp;eV, but with the conse-
quence that fewer channels will describe each characteristic 
peak.
</p>
<p> EDS Time Constant (Resolution 
and&nbsp;Throughput)
</p>
<p>The EDS is only capable of processing one photon at a time. 
The basic measurement cycle is the photoelectric absorp-
tion of the photon in the detector active volume, measure-
ment of the charge deposited by scattering of the 
</p>
<p>photoelectron to determine the photon energy, and incre-
menting the appropriate energy bin in the EDS histogram 
by one count. The EDS time constant (also known as the 
shaping time, the processing time, the maximum through-
put, or other terms in different vendor EDS systems) effec-
tively determines the amount of time spent on the 
measurement cycle. A short time constant enables more 
photons to be processed per unit of real (clock) time, but 
the trade-off of faster processing is poorer accuracy in 
assigning the photon energy. While the characteristic X-ray 
peak has a sharply defined energy, with a natural peak width 
of a few eV or less, the EDS measurement process inevitably 
substantially broadens the measured peak. For example, 
Mn K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 has a natural width of approximately 7&nbsp;eV (deter-
</p>
<p>mined as the FWHM) but as displayed in the EDS histo-
gram, the Mn K-L

<p>FWHM or more, depending on the choice of time constant. 
For the particular silicon drift detector (SDD)-EDS and 
time constant shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 20.1, the broadened EDS 
peak has a FWHM = 126&nbsp;eV.&nbsp;The peak width increases (i.e., 
resolution becomes poorer) as the time constant decreases. 
The shortest time constant, which gives the highest through-
put but the broadest peaks (poorest resolution), is typically 
chosen for analysis situations where it is important to max-
imize the total number of X-ray counts per unit of clock 
(real) time, such as elemental X-ray mapping. For quantita-
tive analysis, better peak resolution is desirable, and thus a 
longer time constant should be chosen. Whichever time 
constant strategy is selected, it is important for standards-
based quantitative analysis that this same time constant be 
used for all measurements of unknowns and standards, 
especially if archived standards are used.
</p>
<p> EDS Calibration
</p>
<p>Assigning the proper energy bin for a photon measure-
ment depends on the EDS being calibrated. The vendor for 
a particular EDS system will have a recommended calibra-
tion procedure that should be followed on a regular basis 
as part of establishing a quality measurement environ-
ment, with full documentation of the measurements to 
establish the on- going calibration record. A typical cali-
bration strategy is to choose a material such as Cu that 
provides (with E
</p>
<p>0
 &ge; 15&nbsp;keV) strongly excited peaks in the 
</p>
<p>low photon energy range (Cu L
3
M
</p>
<p>5
 = 0.93&nbsp; keV) and the 
</p>
<p>high photon energy range (Cu K-L
2,3
</p>
<p> = 8.04&nbsp; keV). 
Alternatively, some EDS systems that provide a &ldquo;zero 
energy reference&rdquo; signal will use this value with a single 
high photon energy peak such as Cu K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 or Mn K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 to 
</p>
<p>perform calibration. A good quality assurance practice is 
to begin each measurement campaign by measuring a 
spectrum of Cu (or another element, e.g., Mn, Ni, etc., or a 
compound, e.g., CuS, FeS
</p>
<p>2
, etc.) under the user-defined 
</p>
<p>conditions. This Cu spectrum can be compared to the Cu 
spectrum that is stored in the archive of standards to con-
firm that the current measurement conditions are identi-
cal to those used to create the archive. This starting Cu 
spectrum should always be saved as part of the quality 
assurance plan.

<p> EDS Solid Angle
</p>
<p>The solid angle of collection, Ω, is given by
</p>
<p>W = A r/
2
</p>
<p> 
(20.1)
</p>
<p>where A is the active area of the detector and r is the distance 
from the X-ray source on the specimen to the detector. Some 
EDS systems are mounted on a retractable arm that 
enables the analyst to choose the value of r. A consistent and 
</p>
<p>reproducible choice must be made for r since this value has 
such a strong impact on Ω and thus on the number of pho-
tons detected per unit of dose.
</p>
<p>20.2.2  Choosing the&nbsp;Beam Energy, E
0
</p>
<p>The choice of beam energy depends on the particular 
aspects of the analysis that the analyst wishes to optimize. 
As a starting point, a useful general analysis strategy is to 
optimize the excitation of photon energies up to 12&nbsp;keV 
by choosing an incident beam energy of 20&nbsp; keV, which 
provides sufficient overvoltage (E
</p>
<p>0
/E
</p>
<p>c
 &gt; 1.5) for K-shell 
</p>
<p>(to Br) and L-shell (elements to Bi) for reasonable excita-
tion. The characteristic peaks of X-ray families that occur 
in the photon energy range from 4&nbsp;keV to 12&nbsp;keV are gen-
erally sufficiently separated in energy to be resolved by 
EDS.&nbsp; When it is important to measure those elements 
whose characteristic peaks occur below 4&nbsp;keV, and espe-
cially for the low atomic number elements Be, B, C, N, O 
and F, for which the characteristic peaks occur below 
1&nbsp; keV and suffer high absorption, then analysis with 
lower beam energy, 10&nbsp;keV or lower, will be necessary to 
optimize the results.
</p>
<p>20.2.3  Measuring the&nbsp;Beam Current
</p>
<p>The SEM should be equipped for beam current measure-
ment, ideally with an in-column Faraday cup which can be 
selected periodically during the analysis procedure to 
determine the beam current. As an alternative, a picoam-
meter can be installed between the electrically isolated 
specimen stage and the electrical ground to measure the 
absorbed (specimen) current that must flow to ground to 
avoid specimen charging. The specimen current is the dif-
ference between the beam current and the loss of charge 
due to BSE and SE emission, both of which vary with com-
position. To measure the true beam current, BSE and SE 
emission must be recaptured, which is accomplished by 
placing the beam within a Faraday cup, which is con-
structed as a blind hole in a conducting material (e.g., 
metal or carbon) covered with a small entrance aperture 
(e.g., an electron microscope aperture of 50&nbsp;μm diameter 
or less). This Faraday cup is then placed at a suitable loca-
tion on the electrically isolated specimen stage. By locat-
ing the beam in the center of the Faraday cup aperture 
opening, the primary beam electrons as well as all BSEs 
and SEs generated at the inner surfaces are collected with 
very little loss through the small aperture, so that the cur-
rent flowing to the electrical ground is the total incident 
beam current.

</p>
<p>20.2.4  Choosing the&nbsp;Beam Current
</p>
<p>After the analyst has chosen the EDS time constant, the 
detector solid angle (for a retractable detector), and the beam 
energy, the beam current should be chosen so as to give a 
reasonable detector throughput, as expressed by the system 
dead-time. . Figure&nbsp;20.2 shows the relationship between the 
input count rate (ICR) of X-rays that arrive at the detector 
and the output count rate (OCR) of photons that are actually 
stored in the measured spectrum. The OCR initially rises lin-
early with the ICR, but as photons arrive at a progressively 
greater rate at the detector, photon coincidence begins to 
occur and the anti-coincidence function begins to reject 
these coincidence events, reducing the OCR.&nbsp; Eventually a 
maximum OCR value is reached beyond which the OCR 
decreases with increasing ICR, eventually falling to zero 
(&ldquo;paralyzable dead-time&rdquo;). A useful measure of the activity 
state of the EDS detector is the system &ldquo;dead-time&rdquo; which is 
defined as
</p>
<p>Dead-time ICR OCR ICR% /( ) = ( )&eacute;&euml; &ugrave;&ucirc;*- 100  (20.2)
</p>
<p>A classic strategy with the low throughput Si(Li)-EDS is to 
select a beam current on a highly excited pure element such 
as Al or Si that produces a dead-time of 30 % or less. With 
</p>
<p>SDD-EDS, a more conservative counting strategy is sug-
gested, such that the beam current is chosen so that the 
dead- time on the most highly excited standard of interest, 
for example, Al or Si, is less than 10 %. Despite the opera-
tion of the anti-coincidence function, SDD-EDS systems 
typically show evidence of coincidence peaks above a dead-
time of 10 % from highly excited parent peaks, as illustrated 
in . Fig.&nbsp; 20.3, which shows the in-growth of an extensive 
set of coincidence peaks from several parent peaks. If it is 
important to measure low intensity X-ray peaks that cor-
respond to minor or trace constituents that occur in spec-
tral regions affected by coincidence peaks, then choosing 
the low dead- time to minimize coincidence will be an 
important issue in selecting the general analytical condi-
tions. If there is no interest in measuring X-ray peaks of 
possible constituents that occur in the region of coinci-
dence peaks, then these regions can be ignored and a 
counting strategy that involves higher dead-time operation 
can be used.
</p>
<p>Once the analytical conditions (EDS time constant, solid 
angle, beam energy, and beam current appropriate to the 
complete suite of standards) have been chosen, these condi-
tions should be used for all standards and unknowns to 
achieve the basic measurement consistency required for the 
k-ratio/matrix corrections protocol.

these factors as well as uncertainties due to the counting sta-
tistics associated with the measurements of the unknown and 
of the standard (Ritchie and Newbury 2012). Careful exami-
nation of these factors can be used to refine the analytical 
strategy to optimize the measurement. Reducing the uncer-
tainty due to the counting statistics requires increasing the 
dose. The absorption factor A is strongly influenced by the

<p>20.3.2  Analysis of&nbsp;Major Constituents 
(C &gt; 0.1 Mass Fraction) with&nbsp;Severely 
Overlapping Peaks
</p>
<p> PbS
</p>
<p>The throughput and the peak stability (calibration and reso-
lution) of SDD-EDS spectrometry enable collection of high 
count, high quality spectra (&gt;5&nbsp;million counts) within mod-
est measurement time, 100&nbsp; s or less. High count spectra 
enable measurements of minor and trace constituents with 
high precision. High counts and stable peak structures are 
critical for successful peak intensity measurements by peak- 
fitting methods, which is especially important for situations 
where two or more peaks are so close in photon energy that 
the EDS resolution function convolves the peaks into mutual 
interference. Despite extreme peak interference, quantitative 
X-ray microanalysis can be achieved with RDEV values of 
5 % relative or less (Newbury and Ritchie 2015a).
</p>
<p>PbS (galena) represents a challenging analysis situation 
for EDS because of the severe interference between the S 
K-L
</p>
<p>2
 (2.307&nbsp; keV) and Pb M
</p>
<p>5
-N
</p>
<p>6,7
 (2.343&nbsp; keV), which are 
</p>
<p>separated by 36&nbsp;eV, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;20.5. Analysis of PbS 
with DTSA II using CuS and PbSe as peak-fitting references 
and as standards yields the results in . Table&nbsp; 20.5. Despite 
the severe peak interference, the relative error based on the 
formula stoichiometry is only &plusmn;1.2 % for S and Pb.
</p>
<p>Note that an alternative analytical approach would be to 
select the beam energy such that E
</p>
<p>0
 &ge; 20&nbsp;keV so that the Pb 
</p>
<p>L-family is excited (L
III

<p>20.3.3  Analysis of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Minor Constituent 
with&nbsp;Peak Overlap From&nbsp;a&nbsp;Major 
Constituent
</p>
<p>The problem of accurately recovering peak intensities when 
overlaps occur is exacerbated when the concentration ratio of 
the elements producing the overlapping peaks is large, for 
example, a major constituent (C &gt; 0.1 mass fraction) interfering 
with a minor (0.01 &le; C &le; 0.1) constituent. The high throughput 
(&gt;100&nbsp;kHz output count rate) of SDD-EDS enables collection 
of high count EDS spectra in modest collection time (e.g., 
10&nbsp;million counts in 100&nbsp;s). Moreover, the high throughput of 
SDD-EDS is achieved with stability in both the peak position 
(i.e., calibration)&nbsp;and the peak shape (i.e., resolution) across the 
entire input &nbsp; count rate range. In simultaneous WDS-EDS 
 measurements, this SDD-EDS performance been demon-
strated to the spectrum measurement capabilities necessary for 
robust MLLS peak-fitting to achieve accurate measurement of 
the interfering peak intensities equal to that of WDS on the 
spectroscopically resolved peaks (Ritchie et&nbsp;al. 2012).

chiometry. The analytical results are seen to closely match the 
stoichiometry of the ideal mineral formula.

<p>20.3.5  Ba-Ti Interference: Major/Minor 
Constituent Interference in&nbsp;K2496 
Microanalysis Glass
</p>
<p>NIST microanalysis research material K2496 glass contains 
these same elements, but with Ba as a major constituent 
(C = 0.4299 mass fraction) and Ti as a minor constituent 
(C = 0.01799 mass fraction), giving an elemental ratio of Ba/
Ti = 23.9. . Figure&nbsp;20.8a shows the SDD-EDS spectrum and 
residual after peak fitting, and . Table&nbsp; 20.8 contains the 
results of the analysis. Despite the severe overlap and the 
large elemental ratio, the concentration for Ti is measured 
with reasonable accuracy. A reasonable question that the 
analyst might ask is, If it was not known that the Ti was pres-
ent, could it be detected? . Figure&nbsp; 20.8b shows the fitting 
residual for an analysis protocol in which Ti was not fit. The 
peaks for Ti K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 and Ti K-M
</p>
<p>3
 are revealed in the residual 
</p>
<p>spectrum.
</p>
<p>20.4  The Need for&nbsp;an&nbsp;Iterative Qualitative 
and&nbsp;Quantitative Analysis Strategy
</p>
<p>The analysis of NIST glass K2496 demonstrates that rigorous 
analysis requires an iterative qualitative analysis&ndash;quantita-
tive analysis approach. When analyzing an unknown 
material, it is likely that some constituents at the minor and 
trace level will not be obvious when the first qualitative anal-
ysis is performed due to peak interference from constituents 
at higher concentrations. An alternating qualitative&ndash;quanti-
tative analytical strategy is required to discover possibly hid-
den minor and trace constituents. In the initial qualitative 
analysis, the EDS spectrum is evaluated to identify the major 
and minor elemental constituents whose peaks are readily 
identifiable. The k-ratio/matrix correction protocol is then 
applied with appropriate choices for elemental peak-fitting 
references and for standards, and the &ldquo;residual&rdquo; spectrum is 
constructed that contains the intensity remaining after the 
fitted peaks have been subtracted. If all constituents have 
been accounted for, this residual spectrum should only con-
sist of the continuum background and possibly also artifact 
peaks such as escape and coincidence peaks. However, 
because of the relative poor energy resolution of EDS, the 
analyst must perform a second qualitative analysis of the 
residual spectrum for the presence of previously unrecog-
nized peaks that are associated with constituents that suffer 
interference from the higher intensity peaks. If such peaks 
are discovered and assigned to an element(s) not previously 
recognized, the quantitative analysis must then be repeated 
with this element(s) included in the peak-fitting and

<p>IN100 is a nickel-based superalloy which produces the

lies; and Mo L-family. Analysis with the k-ratio/matrix

<p>When is a Standard Not Suitable as a Peak-Fitting Reference?
One of the great strengths of the k-ratio/matrix correc-
</p>
<p>tion protocol is simplicity of the required standards. Pure 
elements can be used for most of the periodic table, and for 
those elements that are not in a suitable solid form at ambient 
temperature and at the low chamber pressure, stoichiometric 
binary compounds that are stable under the beam can be 
used. This is an excellent situation for the analyst, since it is 
generally not possible to have a multi-element standard that 
is homogeneous on the microscopic scale and similar in

<p>composition to a particular unknown specimen. For many 
simple binary as well as more complex mixtures of elements, 
Nature favors heterogeneity on the microscale, and many 
combinations of elements tend to phase separate to produce 
chemically heterogeneous microstructures. However, there 
are important cases where microscopically homogeneous, 
multi-element compositions are available, such as minerals, 
glasses, and a few metal alloys. An example is NIST Standard 
Reference Material 479, an Fe-Cr-Ni alloy which is certified 
to be homogeneous on a microscopic scale. SRM 479 can 
serve as a standard for the analysis of another more complex 
stainless steel. . Figure&nbsp;20.11 shows the spectrum of a type 
316 stainless steel which the initial qualitative analysis shows 
that in addition to Cr, Fe, and Ni also contains peaks for Si 
and Mo. While SRM 479 is an ideal standard for this analysis 
of Cr, Fe, and Ni, it is not suitable to provide peak-fitting ref-
erences for Cr, Fe, and Ni because of the mutual interference 
of these peaks. Thus, pure elements for Cr, Fe, and Ni are 
used for the peak-fitting references, while SRM 479 is used as 
the standard, reducing the magnitude of the matrix correc-
tions because of the close similarity of the unknown and 
standard compositions. When the analysis is performed, 
including elemental Si and Mo as references and standards, 
</p>
<p>the results given in . Table&nbsp; 20.10 (column 2) are obtained. 
Close examination of the residual spectrum reveals the peaks 
of the Mn K-family. When the analysis is repeated including 
Mn in the suite of fitted elements, the results given in 
. Table&nbsp;20.10 (column 3) are obtained with a concentration 
of Mn = 0.0154, and the residual spectrum no longer contains 
anomalous peaks, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;20.11c, d.

<p>20.4.3  Progressive Discovery: Repeated 
Qualitative&ndash;Quantitative Analysis 
Sequences
</p>
<p>Complex unknowns may require several iterations of qualita-
tive and quantitative analysis to discover all of the constitu-
ents. For such situations, the analytical total as well as the 
residual spectrum serve as powerful guides to reach a suc-
cessful result. As an example, consider the spectrum of a 
monazite (a lanthanum-cerium phosphate mineral) shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;20.12a, b. The elements recognized in the first quali-
tative analysis stage are O, P, La, Ce (major) and Al, Si, Ca, 
and Th (minor). The first quantitative analysis round for 
these elements, with O calculated by stoichiometry, yielded

<p>the results listed in . Table&nbsp;20.11 (first analysis). The analyti-
cal total is anomalously low at 0.7635. The second round of 
qualitative analysis of the fitting residuals from the first quan-
titative analysis in . Fig.&nbsp;20.12c&ndash;e shows several new peaks 
that are identified: Sr, Y, and Zr in the P region and Ti, Pr, and 
Nd in the La-Ce region. When these elements are included in 
the second round of quantitative analysis, as listed in 
. Table&nbsp; 20.11, the analytical total increases to 0.9629. The 
third round of qualitative analysis of the fitting residuals 
from the second quantitative analysis in . Fig.&nbsp;20.12f,g shows 
Nb in the P region and Sm and Fe in the La-Ce region. After 
the third round of quantitative analysis, the analytical total 
increases to 0.9960, and the third round residuals are shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;20.12h, i superimposed on the residuals from rounds 
one and two, indicating only minor changes between rounds 
two and three. Should this analysis be repeated for a fourth 
round? The level of Nb that has been measured is only 0.0006 
(600&nbsp; ppm), and the confidence is this level is low. There 
remain some low level structures in the third analysis residu-
als, but to take this analysis further, the spectrum should be 
measured for additional time to increase the total count at 
least by a factor of four.
</p>
<p>20.5  Is the&nbsp;Specimen Homogeneous?
</p>
<p>For the most part, Nature seems to prefer heterogeneity on a 
microscopic scale. That is, many combinations of two or 
more elements spontaneously form two or more phases, 
where a phase is defined as matter that is distinct in chemical 
composition and physical state, thus creating a chemical 
</p>
<p>microstructure. Indeed, the great value of electron excited 
X-ray microanalysis is its capability to measure elemental 
composition on the spatial scale of a micrometer and finer to 
characterize this chemical microstructure.
</p>
<p>As part of an effective analysis strategy, it is generally wise 
to make multiple measurements of each distinct region of 
interest of a specimen rather than just a single measurement. 
When a material is sampled at multiple locations under 
 carefully controlled, reproducible analytical conditions, there 
will inevitably be variations in the results due to the natural 
statistical fluctuations in the numbers of measured X-rays, 
both for the characteristic and continuum background of the 
specimen and the standard. The question often arises when 
examining the variations in such replicate results if the mate-
rial can be regarded as homogeneous or if the degree of 
variation in the results is indicative of actual specimen het-
erogeneity.
</p>
<p>In electron-excited X-ray microanalysis, what is of ulti-
mate importance is the precision of the composition rather 
than just that of an individual intensity measurement for an 
element. This point has been discussed in detail by Ziebold 
(1967) and Lifshin et&nbsp;al. (1999). Note first that a k ratio con-
sists actually of the averages of four measurements: N
</p>
<p>sam
, the 
</p>
<p>mean intensity measured on the sample; N
sam
</p>
<p>(B), the corre-
sponding mean background at the same energy; N
</p>
<p>stan
, the 
</p>
<p>intensity measured on the standard; and N
stan
</p>
<p>(B), the corre-
sponding background for the standard:
</p>
<p>k N N N N= ( )&eacute;&euml; &ugrave;&ucirc; ( )&eacute;&euml; &ugrave;&ucirc;sam sam stan stanB B- -/  (20.4)
</p>
<p>In reality a single measurement of each of the four terms in 
Eq. (20.4) results in only a single estimate of k and many sets 
of measurements are required to approach the true mean 
value of k.
</p>
<p>For multiple determinations of the k-ratio, Ziebold (1967) 
showed that the precision in the k-ratio (σ
</p>
<p>k
) is given by

<p>1 1-( ) = -( )&eacute;&euml; &ugrave;&ucirc;k k a C C/ /  (20.8)
</p>
<p>The parameter &ldquo;a&rdquo; can be calculated using Eq. (20.8) with the 
measured value of k and the calculated value of C from the 
quantitative analysis software results.
</p>
<p>Equation&nbsp;20.4 makes it possible to assess statistical uncer-
tainty in an estimate of composition. For example, it can be 
used to construct a confidence interval (e.g., &plusmn; 1.96σ
</p>
<p>C
 gives 
</p>
<p>the 95 % confidence interval) for the difference of two sam-
ples or to plan how many counts must be collected to be able 
to estimate differences between two samples at the desired 
level of precision. The calculation of the confidence interval 
is based on the normal distribution of the estimate of C for 
large samples. This confidence interval is only based on the 
statistical uncertainty inherent in the X-ray counts. The full 
error budget requires also estimating the uncertainty in the 
principal matrix corrections for absorption (A) and scatter-
ing/energy loss (Z) (Ritchie and Newbury 2012). NIST 
DTSA-II provides these error estimates in addition to the 
error in the measurement of the k-ratio.

<p>These intensities yield the following mean k-values:

</p>
<p>From the NIST DTSA-II results and Eq. (20.6):
</p>
<p>Mo k = 0.1235 C = 0.2132 (normalized C = 0.2148) a = 1.92
W k = 0.7540 C = 0.7792 (normalized C = 0.7852) a = 1.15

</p>
<p>If multiple locations are measured under consistent mea-
surement conditions&mdash;e.g., constant beam energy, beam cur-
rent, and EDS performance&mdash;then values that fall outside the 
ranges given for Mo and W are indicative of heterogeneity, 
that is, real deviations in the composition of the alloy. 
. Table&nbsp;20.12 lists 15 measurements on this alloy made at ran-
domly selected locations, which reveal significant heterogene-
ity with the most extreme excursion approximately 11 % in the 
</p>
<p>Mo constituent from the ideal values. This deviation is well 
outside that expected from natural variations due to statistical 
fluctuations in the measured counts as calculated above.

<p>20.6  Beam-Sensitive Specimens
</p>
<p>In some cases, the interaction of the electron beam can dam-
age the specimen and locally alter the composition, often 
with the effects showing a strong dependence on the total 
dose, the dose per unit volume, and the dose rate.
</p>
<p>20.6.1  Alkali Element Migration
</p>
<p>In some insulating materials, especially non-crystalline mate-
rials such as glasses, alkali family elements can migrate in 
response to the local charge injected below the surface by the 
beam, even when a thin conducting surface layer such as car-
bon has been applied to discharge the specimen. Migration 
typically leads to diminishing alkali concentration with time 
in the excited volume. The phenomenon can be detected by 
measuring a time series of spectra and carefully comparing the 
intensity of alkali element peaks to stable matrix peaks such as 
that of Si, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;20.14 for &ldquo;Corning glass A&rdquo; which 
has a high alkali composition with approximately 10 weight 
percent Na and 2.4 weight percent potassium (listed in 
. Table&nbsp;20.11) (Vicenzi et&nbsp;al. 2002). Each spectrum shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;20.14 was recorded for 10&nbsp;s with a fixed, focused beam, 
which creates the maximum possible dose per unit volume.

<p>Comparing the first (150-nA-s dose) and the second spectra 
(300-nA-s dose), the Na intensity is seen to fall by more than a 
factor of two as the dose increases, while the K intensity 
diminishes by approximately 20 %. After a dose of 1500&nbsp;nA-s, 
the Na peak is reduced to approximately 10 % of its intensity 
after 10&nbsp;s, while the K peak decreases to approximately 25 % of 
its original value, whereas other non-alkali elements&mdash;e.g., 
Mg, Al, Ca, Si, etc.&mdash;remain nearly constant with dose. Even 
this time series is somewhat misleading. If the initial dose is 
reduced by a factor of 10, the Na intensity observed is higher 
by approximately 30 %, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;20.15, while the K 
intensity is higher by approximately 5 %. At the extremely high 
volumetric dose created by the fixed point beam in these 
experiments, significant alkali migration occurs even with the 
initial short beam dwell (e.g., 1&nbsp;s, 15&nbsp;nA). The effects of the 
dose on the results obtained by quantitative analysis with 
DTSA-II are given in . Table&nbsp;20.13. Even in the first analysis 
(150&nbsp;nA-s dose), the measured Na concentration is a factor of 
2 lower than the synthesized glass composition, and after the 
maximum dose utilized for this series (1500&nbsp;nA-s dose), the 
Na concentration has decreased by a factor of 11.
</p>
<p>Methods to reduce alkali element migration are based on 
modifying the total dose, the dose per unit area (and volume), 
and/or the dose rate. Reducing the dose per unit area is often 
one of the most effective ways to control migration. By defo-
cusing the fixed beam or by scanning the focused beam rap-
idly over a large area, the dose per unit area can be greatly 
reduced, often by several orders of magnitude, compared to a 
fixed, focused beam. Because of the basic assumption of the 
k-ratio/matrix correction protocol that the material being 
analyzed must have the same composition over the entire vol-
ume excited by the electron beam, this increased-area strategy 
is only valid providing the region of analytical interest is 
homogeneous over a sufficiently large to accommodate the 
defocused or rapidly scanned beam. The effect of increasing 
the scanned area is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;20.16 for Corning glass A, 
where the measured Na intensity increases rapidly as the 
scanned area is increased. . Table&nbsp; 20.14 compares DTSA-II 
quantitative analyses of spectra with the same dose (15&nbsp;keV, 
1500&nbsp;nA-s) obtained with a point beam and with that beam 
rapidly scanning over an area 100&nbsp;μm square. The scanned 
area results correspond very closely to the as-synthesized

K concentrations. . Figure&nbsp; 20.17 shows that the measured 
sodium and potassium concentrations increase to reach the

increased to cover areas above 20&nbsp;x 20-μm (nominal magnifi-
cation 5&nbsp;kX) for the particular dose utilized (15&nbsp;keV, 1500&nbsp;nA-s). 
Thus, while scanning a large homogeneous area obviously 
concedes the spatial resolution capability of electron-excited 
X-ray microanalysis, this approach may be the most expedient 
technique to control and minimize alkali element migration.

O that evaporate into the vacuum, causing 
</p>
<p>substantial mass loss from the interaction volume. At the 
highest beam currents, typically 10&ndash;100&nbsp; nA, used with a 
focused beam at a static location, it is also possible to cause 
highly damaging temperature elevations, which further exac-
erbate mass loss. Indeed, when analyzing this specimen class 
it should be assumed that significant mass loss will occur dur-
ing the measurement at each point of the specimen. If all con-
stituents were lost at the same rate, then simply normalizing 
the result would compensate for the mass loss that occurs 
during the accumulation of the X-ray spectrum. Unfortunately, 
the matrix constituents (principally carbon compounds and 
water) can be selectively lost, while the heavy elements of 
interest in biological microanalysis (e. g., Mg, P, S, K, Ca, Fe, 
etc.) remain in the bombarded region of the specimen and 
appear to be present at effectively higher concentration than 
existed in the original specimen. What is then required of any 
analytical procedure for biological and polymeric specimens 
is a mechanism to provide a meaningful analysis under these 
conditions of a specimen that undergoes continuous change. 
</p>
<p>Marshall and Hall (1966) and Hall (1968) made the original 
suggestion that the X-ray continuum could serve as an inter-
nal standard to monitor specimen changes. This assumption 
permitted development of the key procedure for beam-sensi-
tive specimens that is used extensively in the biological com-
munity and that is also applicable in many types of polymer 
analysis. This application marks the earliest use of the X-ray 
continuum as a tool (rather than simply a hindrance) for 
analysis, and that work forms the basis for the development of 
the peak-to-local background method applied to challenging 
geometric forms such as particles and rough surfaces. The 
technique was initially developed for applications in the high 
beam current EPMA, but the procedure works well in the 
SEM environment.
</p>
<p>The Marshall&ndash;Hall method (Marshall and Hall 1966) 
requires that several key conditions:
 1. The specimen must be in the form of a thin section, 
</p>
<p>where the condition of &ldquo;thin&rdquo; is satisfied when the 
incident beam penetrates with negligible energy loss. For 
an analytical beam energy of 10&ndash;30&nbsp;keV, the energy loss

<p>passing through a section consisting of carbon approxi-
mately 100&ndash;200&nbsp;nm in thickness will be less than 
500&nbsp;eV.&nbsp;This condition permits the beam energy to be 
treated as a constant, which is critical for the develop-
ment of the correction formula. Biological specimens are 
thus usually analyzed in the form of thin sections cut to 
approximately 100-nm thickness by microtome. 
Polymers may also be analyzed when similarly prepared 
as thin sections by microtoming or by ion beam milling. 
Such a specimen configuration also has a distinct 
advantage for improving the spatial resolution of the 
analysis compared to a bulk specimen. The analytical 
volume in such thin specimens is approximately the 
cylinder defined by the incident beam diameter and the 
section thickness, which is at least a factor of 10&ndash;100 
smaller in linear dimensions than the equivalent bulk 
specimen case at the same energy, as shown in the 
polymer etching experiment in the Interaction Volume 
module.
</p>
<p> 2. The matrix composition must be dominated by light 
elements, for example, C, H, N, O, whose contributions 
will form nearly all of the X-ray continuum and whose 
concentrations are reasonably well known for the 
specimen. Elements of analytical interest such as Mg, P, 
S, Cl, K, Ca, and so on, the concentrations of which are 
unknown in the specimen, must only be present 
preferably as trace constituents (&lt;0.01 mass fraction) so 
that their effect on the X-ray continuum can be 
neglected. When the concentration rises above the low 
end of the minor constituent range (e.g., 0.01 to 0.05 
mass fraction or more), the analyte contribution to the 
continuum can no longer be ignored.
</p>
<p> 3. A standard must be available with a known concentra-
tion of the trace/minor analyte of interest and for which 
the complete composition of low-atomic-number 
elements is also known and which is stable under 
electron beam bombardment. Glasses synthesized with 
low atomic number oxides such as boron oxide are 
suitable for this role. The closer the low&ndash;atomic-number 
element composition of the standard is to that of the 
unknown, the more accurate will be the results.

<p>equal to the right side of Eq. (20.9). Since the target being 
irradiated is a reference standard, the atomic numbers Z
</p>
<p>i
, 
</p>
<p>atomic weights A
i
 and weight fractions C
</p>
<p>i
 are known for all 
</p>
<p>constituents, and the J
i
 values can be calculated as needed. 
</p>
<p>The only unknown term is then the constant &ldquo;c&rdquo; in Eq. (20.9), 
which can now be determined by dividing the measured 
intensity ratio, I
</p>
<p>A
/I
</p>
<p>cm
, by the calculated term. Next, under the 
</p>
<p>same measurement conditions, the characteristic &ldquo;A&rdquo; inten-
sity and the continuum intensity at the chosen energy are 
determined for the specimen location(s). Providing that the 
low-Z elements that form the matrix of the specimen are 
similar to the standard, or in the optimum case these 
 concentrations are actually known for the specimen (or can 
be estimated from other information about the actual, local-
ized, material being irradiated by the electrons, and not some 
bulk property), then this value of &ldquo;c&rdquo; determined from the 
standard can be used to calculate the weight fraction of the 
analyte, C
</p>
<p>A
, for the specimen.
</p>
<p>This basic theme can be extended and several analytes&mdash;
&ldquo;A,&rdquo; &ldquo;B,&rdquo; &ldquo;C,&rdquo; etc.&mdash;can be analyzed simultaneously if a suit-
able standard or suite of standards containing the analytes is 
available. The method can be extended to higher concentra-
tions, but the details of this extension are beyond the scope of 
this book; a full description and derivation can be found in 
Kitazawa et&nbsp;al. (1983). Commercial computer X-ray analyzer 
systems may have the Marshall&ndash;Hall procedure included in 
their suite of analysis tools. The Marshall&ndash;Hall procedure 
works well for thin specimens in the &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; analyti-
cal energy regime (E
</p>
<p>0
 &ge; 10&nbsp;keV) of the SEM.&nbsp;The method will 
</p>
<p>not work for specimens where the average atomic number is 
expected to vary significantly from one analysis point to 
another, or relative to that of the standard. A bulk specimen 
where the beam-damaged region is not constrained by the

</p>
<p>dimensions of the thin section, so that the region continues 
to change during electron bombardment also violates the 
fundamental assumptions. Consequently, many materials 
science applications for &ldquo;soft&rdquo; materials cannot be accommo-
dated by the classic Marshall&ndash;Hall procedure.
</p>
<p> Bulk Biological and&nbsp;Organic Specimens
</p>
<p>The quantitative procedures devised by Statham and Pawley 
(1978) and Small et&nbsp;al. (1979) for the analysis of particles and 
rough specimens have been adapted to the analysis of bulk 
biological and organic samples (Roomans 1981, 1988; Echlin 
1998). The method is based on the use of the ratio between 
the intensity of the characteristic and background X-rays 
defined as P/B, where P and B are measured over the range of 
energies that defines an EDS peak. The rationale behind the 
development of the method is that since the characteristic 
and background X-rays are generated within nearly the same 
depth distribution, they are subject to the same composi-
tional related absorption and atomic number effects. It is 
assumed that the percentage of characteristic X-rays absorbed 
by the sample is the same as the percentage of continuum 
X-rays of the same energy which are absorbed. In the ratio 
P/B, the absorption factor (A) is no longer relevant as it has 
the same value in the numerator as the denominator and thus 
cancels. Since backscattered electrons are being lost due to 
changes in atomic number (Z), there is a similar decrease in 
the efficiency of production of both peak and background. 
Because the reduced X-ray production affects both peak and 
background in a similar (although not identical way), this 
factor is also cancelled out to a first order when the ratio P/B 
is measured. Additionally, because nearly all biological and/
or organic materials consist of low atomic number matrix 
elements (Z
</p>
<p>max
 = 10) the secondary fluorescence effect (F) is 
</p>
<p>low and can be treated as a secondary order correction.
Strictly, these assumptions only hold true for homogeneous 
</p>
<p>samples as the characteristic and background X-rays will vary 
with changes in the average atomic number of the sample. 
However, this is not considered to have any significant effect in 
cases where the P/B ratio method is applied to fully hydrated 
specimens which contain 85&ndash;90 % water or to dried organic 
material containing a small amount of light element salts. The 
ratio of peak area to the background immediately beneath the 
peak is relatively insensitive to small changes in surface geom-
etry. However, the sample surface should be as smooth as is 
practicable because uneven fracture faces give unreliable X-ray 
data because of preferential masking and absorption.
</p>
<p>Spectra are processed by the following procedure. The 
peaks in the spectra of the unknown and a standard of simi-
lar composition are fit by an appropriate procedure, such as 
multiple linear least squares, to determine the peak area for 
element i, P
</p>
<p>i
. The spectrum after peak-fitting and subtraction 
</p>
<p>is then examined again to determine the background inten-
sity remaining in the peak region of interest, giving the cor-
responding B
</p>
<p>i
 at the same photon energy. Once accurate P/B 
</p>
<p>ratios are obtained, they can be used for quantitation in a 
number of ways. The P/B value for one element can be com-
pared with the P/B value for another element in the same 
sample and to a first order:
</p>
<p>C C h P B P Bi j ij i j
/ / / /( ) = ( ) ( )&eacute;&euml; &ugrave;&ucirc;  
</p>
<p>(20.10)
</p>
<p>where C
i
 and C
</p>
<p>j
 are the percentage concentrations of ele-
</p>
<p>ments i and j and h
ij
 is a correction factor which can be 
</p>
<p>obtained from measurements on a standard(s) of known 
composition very similar in composition to the unknown. 
Once h
</p>
<p>ij
 has been empirically for the element(s) of interest, 
</p>
<p>measurements of the P/B ratio(s) from the unknown can be 
immediately converted into concentration ratios. An advan-
tage of taking the double ratio of (P/B) in Eq. (20.10) is the 
suppression of matrix effects, to a first order.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the P/B value for an element in the sample 
can be compared with the P/B value for the same element in 
a standard provided there is no significant difference in the 
matrix composition between sample and standard. If the 
mean atomic number of a given sample is always the same, 
the Kramers&rsquo; relationship shows that the background radia-
tion is proportional to atomic number. If the mean atomic 
number of the sample is always the same, then
</p>
<p>C h P B
i i
= ( )/
</p>
<p>i  
(20.11)
</p>
<p>where h
i
 is a constant for each element. If it is possible to 
</p>
<p>analyze all the elements and calculate the concentration of 
elements such as C, H, O, and N by stoichiometry, then rela-
tive concentrations can be readily converted to absolute 
 concentrations.
</p>
<p>If there is a significant change in the composition between 
the unknown and standard(s), then a correction must be 
applied based upon the dependence of the continuum upon 
atomic number, following the original Marshall&ndash;Hall thin 
section method:
</p>
<p>C C h P B P B Z A Z Ai j ij i j i i j j
/ / / / / / /( ) = ( ) ( )&eacute;&euml; &ugrave;&ucirc; ( ) ( )&eacute;&euml; &ugrave;&ucirc;
</p>
<p>2 2
</p>
<p> (20.12)
</p>
<p>where Z and A are the atomic number and weight.
The peak-to-background ratio method has been found to 
</p>
<p>be as efficient and accurate for biological materials as the 
more commonly used ZAF algorithms, which have been 
designed primarily for analyzing non-biological bulk sam-
ples. Echlin (1998) gives details of the accuracy and precision 
of the method as applied to hydrated and organic samples. 
For the analysis of a frozen hydrated tea leaf standard where 
independent analysis by atomic absorption spectroscopy was 
available for comparison, peak-to-background corrections 
generally gave results within &plusmn;10 % relative for trace Mg, Al, 
Si, and Ca over a range of beam energies from 5 to 20&nbsp;keV.

<p>&ldquo;Trace analysis&rdquo; refers to the measurement of constituents 
presents at low fractional levels. For SEM/EDS the following 
arbitrary but practical definitions have been chosen to desig-
nate various constituent classes according to these mass con-
centration (C) ranges:
</p>
<p>Major: C &gt; 0.1 mass fraction (greater than 10 wt%)
Minor: 0.01 &le; C &le; 0.1 (1 wt% to 10 wt%)
Trace: C &lt; 0.01 (below 1 wt%)
</p>
<p>Note that by these definitions, while &ldquo;major&rdquo; and &ldquo;minor&rdquo; 
constituents have defined ranges, &ldquo;trace&rdquo; has no minimum. 
Strictly, the presence of a single atom of the element of inter-
est within the electron-excited mass that is analyzed by X-ray 
spectrometry represents the ultimate trace level that might be 
measured for that species, but such detection is far below the 
practical limit for electron-excited energy dispersive X-ray 
spectrometry of bulk specimens. In this section trace analysis 
down to levels approaching a mass fraction of C = 0.0001 (100 
ppm (ppm) will be demonstrated. While such trace measure-
ments are possible with high count EDS spectra, achieving 
reliable trace measurements by electron- excited energy dis-
persive X-ray spectrometry requires careful attention to iden-
tifying and eliminating, if possible, pathological contributions 
to the measured spectrum from unexpected remote radiation 
sources such as secondary fluorescence and backscattered 
electrons (Newbury and Ritchie 2016).
</p>
<p>21.1  Limits of&nbsp;Detection for&nbsp;SEM/EDS 
Microanalysis
</p>
<p>How does the measured EDS X-ray intensity (counts in the 
energy window) for an element behave for constituents in the 
trace regime? As described in the modules on X-ray physics 
and on quantitative X-ray microanalysis, the X-ray spectrum 
that is measured is a result of the complex physics of electron- 
excited X-ray generation and of subsequent propagation of 
X-rays through the specimen to reach the EDS spectrometer. 
The intensity measured for the characteristic X-rays of a par-
ticular element in the excited volume is affected by all other 
elements present, creating the so-called matrix effects: (1) the 
atomic number effect that depends on the rate of electron 
energy loss and on the number of backscattered electrons and 
the BSE energy distribution; (2) the absorption effect, where 
the mass absorption coefficient depends on all elements pres-
ent; and (3) the secondary fluorescence effect, where the 
absorption of characteristic and continuum X-rays with pho-
ton energies above the ionization energy of the element of 
interest leads to additional emission for that element. Consider 
the number of X-rays, N
</p>
<p>A
, including characteristic plus con-
</p>
<p>tinuum, measured in the energy window that spans the peak 
for element &ldquo;A&rdquo; as a function of the concentration C
</p>
<p>A
 in a spe-
</p>
<p>cific mixture of other elements &ldquo;B,&rdquo; &ldquo;C,&rdquo; &ldquo;D,&rdquo; and so on. A 
simple example would be a binary alloy system where there is 
complete solid solubility from pure &ldquo;A&rdquo; to pure &ldquo;B,&rdquo; for 
</p>
<p>example, Au-Cu or Au-Ag. When element &ldquo;A&rdquo; is present as a 
major constituent, as the concentration of &ldquo;A&rdquo; is reduced and 
replaced by &ldquo;B,&rdquo; the matrix effects are likely to change signifi-
cantly as the composition is changed. The impact of &ldquo;B&rdquo; on 
electron scattering and X-ray absorption of &ldquo;A&rdquo; is likely to pro-
duce a complex and non-linear response for N
</p>
<p>A
 as a function 
</p>
<p>of C
A
</p>
<p>. However, when the element of interest &ldquo;A&rdquo; is present in 
the trace concentration range, the matrix composition is very 
nearly constant as the concentration of &ldquo;A&rdquo; is lowered and 
replaced by &ldquo;B,&rdquo; resulting in a monotonic dependence for N
</p>
<p>A
 
</p>
<p>as a function of C
A
</p>
<p>, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;21.1, known as a &ldquo;work-
ing curve,&rdquo; which in the case of a dilute constituent will be 
linear. Consider that we have a known point on this linear plot 
with the values (N
</p>
<p>s
, C
</p>
<p>s
) in the trace concentration range that 
</p>
<p>corresponds to the measurement of a known standard or is 
the result of a quantitative analysis of an unknown. The slope 
m of this linear function can be calculated from this known 
point and the 0 concentration point, for which N

</p>
<p>since there will still be counts, N

</p>
<p>C
DL
</p>
<p> = 754&nbsp;ppm for Ta. This strong variation arises from dif-
ferences in the relative excitation (overvoltage) and fluores-
cence yield for the various elements, differences in the 
continuum intensity, and the partitioning of the characteris-
tic X-ray intensity among widely separated peaks for the 
L-family of the higher atomic number elements, for example, 
Ce and Ta.

<p> After Determination

with&nbsp;Severe Peak Interference 
from&nbsp;a&nbsp;Major Constituent
</p>
<p>Because of the relatively poor energy resolution of EDS, peak 
interference situations are frequently encountered. Multiple 
linear least squares peak fitting can separate the contribu-
tions from two or more peaks within an energy window. This 
effect is illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp; 21.3 for Corning Glass A, the 
composition of which is listed in . Table&nbsp;21.2 along with the 
DTSA II analysis. There is a significant interference for K and 
Ca upon Sb and Sn. The initial qualitative analysis identified 
K and Ca, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;21.3(a). When MLLS peak fit-
ting is applied for K and Ca, the Sn and Sb L-family peaks are 
revealed in the residual spectrum, . Fig.&nbsp;21.3(b). The limit of 
detection calculated from the peak for Sn L determined from 
peak and background intensities determined from this resid-
ual spectrum is C

An example is shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 21.4 for high purity Si. The

<p>21.3.1  Is a&nbsp;Given Trace Level Measurement

<p>Trace analysis with high count EDS spectra can be performed 
to concentrations levels down to 0.0001 mass fraction 
(100&nbsp; ppm) in the absence of interferences and 0.0005 
(500&nbsp;ppm) when peak interference occurs. The careful ana-
lyst will always ask the question, Is a given trace measure-
ment valid? That is, does the measured trace constituent 
actually originate within the interaction volume of the speci-
men that is excited by primary electron beam, or is it the 
result of remote excitation of another part of the specimen or 
from components of the SEM itself?

<p> The Inevitable Physics of&nbsp;Remote Excitation 
Within the&nbsp;Specimen: Secondary Fluorescence 
Beyond the&nbsp;Electron Interaction Volume
</p>
<p>The electron interaction volume contains the region within 
which characteristic and continuum X-rays are directly 
excited by the beam electrons. Electron excitation effectively 
creates a volume source of generated X-rays (characteristic 
and continuum with energies up to the incident beam energy, 
E
</p>
<p>0
) embedded in the specimen that propagates out from the 
</p>
<p>interaction volume in all directions. A photon propagating 
into the specimen will eventually undergo photoelectric 
absorption which ionizes the absorbing atom, and the subse-
quent de-excitation of this atom will result in emission of its 
characteristic X-rays, a process referred to as &ldquo;secondary flu-
orescence&rdquo; to distinguish this source from the &ldquo;primary 
</p>
<p>fluorescence&rdquo; induced directly by the beam electrons. Because 
the range of X-rays is generally one to two orders of magni-
tude greater than the range of electrons, depending on the 
photon energy and the specimen composition, the volume of 
secondary characteristic generation is much larger than the 
volume of primary characteristic generation. The range of 
fluorescence of Fe K-L

 in a 75wt% Ni- 25wt% 
</p>
<p>Fe alloy at E
0
 = 25&nbsp;keV is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;21.5. The electron 
</p>
<p>range is fully contained with a hemisphere of radius 2.5&nbsp;μm, 
but a hemisphere of 80 -μm radius is required to capture 99 % 
of the secondary fluorescence of Fe K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 by Ni K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
. For 
</p>
<p>quantification with the ZAF matrix correction protocol, the 
secondary fluorescence correction factor, F, corrects the cal-
culated composition for the additional radiation created by 
secondary fluorescence due to characteristic X-rays. An 
additional correction, c, is necessary for the continuum- 
induced secondary fluorescence. The F matrix correction 
factor is generally small compared to the absorption, A, and 
atomic number, Z, corrections. For a major constituent, the 
additional radiation due to secondary fluorescence repre-
sents a small perturbation in the apparent concentration, 
often negligible. However, when a constituent is at the trace 
level in the electron interaction volume, propagation of the 
primary characteristic and continuum X-rays into a nearby 
region of the specimen that is richer in this element will cre-
ate additional X-rays of the trace element by secondary fluo-
rescence. Because of the wide acceptance area of the EDS, 
this additional remote source of radiation will still be consid-
ered to be part of the spectrum produced at the beam posi-
tion, possibly severely perturbing the accuracy of the analysis 
of the trace constituent by elevating the measured concentra-
tion above the true concentration. Compensation for this 
artifact requires careful modeling of the electron and X-ray 
interactions.
</p>
<p> Simulation of&nbsp;Long-Range Secondary X-ray 
Fluorescence
</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo electron trajectory simulation embedded in 
DTSA-II models the primary electron trajectories and pri-
mary X-ray generation, as well as the subsequent propaga-
tion of the primary characteristic and continuum X-rays 
through the target and the generation (and subsequent prop-
agation) of secondary characteristic X-rays. The Monte Carlo 
menu provides &ldquo;set-pieces&rdquo; of analytical interest to predict 
the significance of secondary fluorescence at the trace level:

<p>NIST DTSA II Simulation: Cubic Particle  
</p>
<p>Embedded in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Bulk Matrix
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;21.7(a) shows the results of a simulation of a 1-μm 
cube of K-411 glass embedded in a titanium matrix and 
excited with a beam energy of 20&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;For this size and beam 
energy, the primary electron trajectories penetrate through 
the sides and bottom of the cube leading to direct electron 
excitation of the titanium matrix, which is seen as a major 
peak in the calculated spectrum. When the cube dimension 
is increased to 20&nbsp;μm, the beam trajectories at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV are 
</p>
<p>contained entirely within the K-411 cube. DTSA-II allows 
calculations with and without implementing the secondary 
fluorescence calculation. When secondary fluorescence is 
not implemented, the calculated spectrum . Fig.&nbsp; 21.7(b) 
</p>
<p>shows no Ti characteristic X-rays. When secondary fluores-
cence is included in the simulation, a small Ti peak is 
observed, corresponding to an artifact trace level k = 0.0007 
(700&nbsp; ppm), demonstrating the long range of the primary 
X-rays and the creation of a trace level artifact.
</p>
<p>When variable pressure SEM operation is considered, the 
large fraction of gas-scattered electrons creates X-rays from 
regions up to many millimeters from the beam impact point. 
Depending on the surroundings, this gas scattering can 
greatly modify the EDS spectrum from what would originate 
from the region actually excited by the focused beam. 
. Figure&nbsp;21.7(c) shows this effect as simulated with DTSA II, 
resulting in a large peak for Ti, which is not present in the 
specimen but which is located in the surrounding region.

</p>
<p>While secondary fluorescence that leads to generation of 
X-rays at a considerable distance from the beam impact is a 
physical effect which cannot be avoided, there are addi-
tional pathological scattering effects that can be minimized 
or even eliminated. . Figure&nbsp;21.8 depicts the idealized view 
of the emission of X-rays generated by the electron beam in 
the SEM.&nbsp;In this idealized view, the only X-rays that are col-
lected are those emitted into the solid angle of acceptance of 
the detector, which is defined by a cone whose apex is cen-
tered on the specimen interaction volume, whose altitude is 
the specimen-to-detector distance, and whose base is the 
active area of the detector that is not shielded by the

<p>entrance window or other hardware. However, the reality of 
the EDS measurement is likely to be quite different from 
this ideal case, at least at the trace constituent level, as a 
consequence of electron backscattering, shown schemati-
cally in . Fig.&nbsp; 21.9. For targets of intermediate and high 
atomic number, a significant fraction of the incident beam 
is emitted as backscattered electrons, and the majority of 
these BSEs retain more than half of the incident beam 
energy. After leaving the specimen, these BSEs are likely to 
strike the objective lens and the walls of the specimen 
chamber as well as other hardware, where they generate the 
characteristic (and continuum) X-rays of those materials. 
The EDS detector collects X-rays from any source with a 
line-of-sight to the detector, so to minimize remote BSE-
induced contributions to the measured spectrum, the EDS 
is equipped with a collimator whose function is to restrict 
the view of the EDS, as illustrated schematically in 
. Fig.&nbsp;21.9. The solid angle of acceptance of the EDS is sub-
stantially reduced by the collimator, minimizing remote 
contributions from the lens and chamber walls. While the 
collimator provides a critical improvement to the measured 
spectrum, it is important for the analyst to understand its 
inevitable limitations. The actual acceptance solid angle 
must be constructed by looking out from the detector 
through the aperture of the collimator, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 21.10. The typical collimator accepts X-rays 
</p>
<p>generated in the specimen plane within a circular area with 
a diameter of several millimeters, a feature that is important 
for X-ray mapping applications, where the beam is scanned 
over large lateral areas and X-rays must be accepted from 
any beam position within the scanned area. Moreover, the 
acceptance region is three dimensional with a vertical 
dimension of several millimeters along the beam axis. To 
determine the true acceptance volume of the EDS collima-
tor, low magnification (maximum scanning area) X-ray 
mapping of a target such as a blank aluminum sample stub 
provides a direct view of the transmission of the EDS colli-
mator as a function of x-y position and as a function of the 
z-position, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;21.11. For this example, any 
X-ray generated in a large volume (at least 2.5 &times; 3 &times; 10&nbsp;mm) 
can potentially be collected by this EDS system despite the 
otherwise effective collimator. Three important sources of 
uncontrolled remote excitation within this collimator 
acceptance volume are shown in . Fig.&nbsp;21.12: (1) beam elec-
trons scattering off the edge of the final aperture (magenta 
trajectory); (2) beam electrons being stopped by the final 
aperture and generating the characteristic and continuum 
X-rays of the aperture material (e.g., Pt; blue dashed trajec-
tory); and (3) re-scattering of BSEs that have struck the final 
lens and return to the specimen (red trajectory). Both of 
these sources can create X-rays several millimeters or more 
from the beam impact location.

<p>21.4.2  Assessing Remote Excitation Sources 
in&nbsp;an&nbsp;SEM-EDS System
</p>
<p>Remote excitation of X-rays can be assessed by measuring 
various structures. As shown in . Fig.&nbsp;21.13, a multi-mate-
rial Faraday cup can be constructed by placing an SEM 
aperture (typically 2.5&nbsp;mm in diameter and made of plati-
num or another heavy metal) over a blind hole drilled in a 
block of a different metal, such as a 1-cm diameter alumi-
num SEM stub, which is then inserted in a hole drilled in a 
2.5-cm- diameter brass (Cu-Zn) block. This structure can be 
used to measure the &ldquo;in-hole&rdquo; spectrum to assess sources 
and magnitude of remote excitation (Williams and Goldstein 
1981). The following sequence of measurements is made, as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;21.14. The beam is successively placed for 
the same dose on the brass, the Al-stub, the Pt-aperture, and 
finally in the center of the hole (e.g., 200-μm diameter) of 
the aperture. Ideally, if there are no electrons scattered out-
side the beam by interacting with the final aperture or other 
electron column surfaces, the &ldquo;in-hole&rdquo; specimen will have 
no counts. As shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 21.14 with a logarithmic 
intensity display, a small number of counts is detected for 
Pt&nbsp;M, equivalent to k = 0.00008 of the intensity measured for 
the same dose with the beam placed on the Pt aperture. No 
detectable counts are found for Al from the stub or for the 
Cu and Zn from the brass block. Thus, for this particular 
instrument, a small but detectable pathological scattering 
occurs within approximately 1.5&nbsp; mm of the central beam 
axis. While this is a very small effect, the analyst must none-
theless be aware that this unfocused electron or aperture 
X-ray source might contribute an artifact at the trace level if 
</p>
<p>the element of interest at the beam location is abundant in a 
nearby region.
</p>
<p>While a useful measurement and the place to start in assess-
ing remote excitation, the &ldquo;in-hole&rdquo; measurement only detects 
electrons scattered outside of the beam. Typically, a more seri-
ous source of remote excitation is the backscattered electrons 
(BSEs), which are absent from the &ldquo;in-hole&rdquo; measurement. 
. Figure&nbsp; 21.15 shows a modification of the &ldquo;in-hole&rdquo; multi-
material target in which the central hole is replaced by a flat, 
polished scattering target. . Figure&nbsp;21.16 shows an example of a 
spectrum in which the central target is high purity carbon, 
which has a low BSE coefficient of 0.06, surrounded by a 3-mm-
diameter region filled with Ag-epoxy, which is surrounded by a 
Ti block. No detectable counts for characteristic peaks of Ag 
(conducting epoxy) or Ti (specimen holder) are found.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp; 21.17 shows a similar measurement for high 
purity tantalum, which has a high BSE coefficient of 0.45. 
Both Ag and Ti are detectable at very low relative intensity 
compared to the intensity measured with the beam placed on 
pure element targets.
</p>
<p>When a three-dimensional target is used for scattering, as 
illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;21.18, additional BSEs are scattered from the 
tilted surfaces into the regions of the specimen near the beam 
impact point as well as more distant regions surrounding the 
specimen. . Figure&nbsp;21.19 shows such a measurement for a pyra-
midal fragment of SrF
</p>
<p>2
 placed on a brass substrate. Low level 
</p>
<p>signals are observed for CuKα and ZnKα, and also for NiKα, 
which arises from Ni-plating on nearby stage components. This 
extreme case most closely resembles the challenge posed by a 
rough, topographic specimen. The uncontrollable scattering 
renders most trace constituent determinations questionable.

<p>21.5  Summary
</p>
<p>High count EDS spectra can be used to achieve limits of 
detection approaching a mass concentration of C
</p>
<p>DL
 = 0.0001 
</p>
<p>(100&nbsp;ppm) when there are no peak interferences from higher 
concentration constituents, and C
</p>
<p>DL
 = 0.0005 (500&nbsp; ppm) 
</p>
<p>when significant peak interference does occur. However, the 
analyst must carefully test the SEM/EDS measurement envi-
ronment to ensure that the trace measurement is meaningful 
and not a consequence of pathological remote scattering 
effects.

<p>22.1  What Constitutes &ldquo;Low&rdquo; Beam Energy 
X-Ray Microanalysis?
</p>
<p>The incident beam energy, E
0
, is the parameter that deter-
</p>
<p>mines which characteristic X-rays can be excited: the beam 
energy must exceed the critical excitation energy, E
</p>
<p>c
, for an 
</p>
<p>atomic shell to initiate ionization and subsequent emission of 
characteristic X-rays. This dependence is parameterized with 
the &ldquo;overvoltage&rdquo; U
</p>
<p>0,
 defined as
</p>
<p>U =E / E
0 0 c  
</p>
<p>(22.1)
</p>
<p>U
0
 must exceed unity for X-ray emission. The intensity, I
</p>
<p>ch
, of 
</p>
<p>characteristic X-ray generation follows an exponential 
relation:
</p>
<p>I =i a U
n
</p>
<p>ch B 0
1&minus;( )
</p>
<p> 
(22.2)
</p>
<p>where i
B
 is the beam current, a and n are constants, with 
</p>
<p>1.5 &le; n &le; 2.
The intensity of the X-ray continuum (bremsstrahlung), 
</p>
<p>I
cm
</p>
<p>, also depends on the incident beam energy:
</p>
<p>I =i bZ U
cm B 0
</p>
<p>1&minus;( )
 
</p>
<p>(22.3)
</p>
<p>where b is a constant and Z is the mass-concentration- 
averaged atomic number of the specimen.
</p>
<p>The peak-to-background is then obtained as the ratio of 
Eqs. (22.2) and (22.3):
</p>
<p>P / B I / I / Z U
n
</p>
<p>= &minus;
&minus;
</p>
<p>ch cm 0
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>1 1&asymp; ( )( )
 
</p>
<p>(22.4)
</p>
<p>The value of n &minus;1&nbsp;in Eq. (22.4) ranges from 0.5 to 1, so that 
the P/B rises slowly as U
</p>
<p>0
 increases above unity. . Figure&nbsp;22.1 
</p>
<p>shows experimental measurements of Si K-L
2
 + Si K-M
</p>
<p>3
 
</p>
<p>(Si Kα,β) characteristic X-ray intensity as a function of over-
voltage. Near the threshold of U
</p>
<p>0
 = 1, the intensity drops 
</p>
<p>sharply, and the Si K-L
2
 + Si K-M
</p>
<p>3
 peak becomes progres-
</p>
<p>sively lower relative to the X-ray continuum background, as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;22.2 for Si measured over a range of beam 
energies. The peak-to-background strongly influences the 
limit- of- detection. While X-ray measurements can certainly 
be made with 1 &lt; U
</p>
<p>0
 &lt; 1.25 and the limit-of-detection can be 
</p>
<p>improved by increasing the integrated spectrum intensity by 
extending the counting time, the detectability within a prac-
tical measuring time of a constituent excited in this overvolt-
age range diminishes. While major constituents may be 
detected, minor and trace constituents are likely to be below 
the limit of detection. Thus the situation for 1 &lt; U
</p>
<p>0
 &lt; 1.25 
</p>
<p>must generally be considered &ldquo;marginally detectable&rdquo; and is 
so marked in . Figs.&nbsp;22.3, 22.4, 22.5, 22.6, 22.7, and 22.8.

</p>
<p>22.1.1  Characteristic X-ray Peak Selection 
Strategy for&nbsp;Analysis
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conventional&rdquo; electron-excited X-ray microanalysis is typi-
cally performed with an incident beam energy selected 
between 10&nbsp;keV and 30&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;A beam energy is this range is 
capable of exciting X-rays from one or more atomic shells for 
all elements of the periodic table, except for hydrogen and 
helium, which do not produce characteristic X-ray emission. 
Li can produce X-ray emissions, but the energy of 0.052&nbsp;keV 
is below the practical detection limit of most EDS sys-
tems,&nbsp; which typically have a threshold of approximately 
0.1&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;Recent progress in silicon drift detector (SDD)-EDS 
detector technology and isolation windows is rapidly improv-
ing the EDS performance in the photon energy range 50&nbsp;eV&nbsp;&ndash; 
250&nbsp; eV, raising the measurement situation for Li from 
&ldquo;undetectable&rdquo; to the level of &ldquo;marginally detectable.&rdquo; The 
choices available for the characteristic X-ray peaks to analyze 
various elements are illustrated in the periodic table shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;22.3 for E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;In constructing this diagram, 
</p>
<p>the assumption has been made with the requirement that 
U
</p>
<p>0
 &gt; 1.25 (E
</p>
<p>c
 &lt; 16&nbsp; keV) to provide for robust detection of 
</p>
<p>major and minor constituents. Note that in constructing 
. Fig.&nbsp; 22.3, only the excitation of characteristic X-rays has 
been considered and not the subsequent absorption of X-rays 
during propagation through the specimen to reach the detec-
tor. Absorption has a strong effect on low energy X-rays 
below 2-keV photon energy and strongly depends on 
</p>
<p>composition and beam energy. Absorption can be minimized 
by operating at low beam energy, as discussed below, an 
important factor that must also be considered when develop-
ing practical X-ray measurement strategy.
</p>
<p>As seen in . Fig.&nbsp;22.3, when the beam energy is selected at 
the high end of the conventional range, X-rays from two dif-
ferent atomic shells can be excited for many elements, and the 
additional information provided by having two X-ray families 
with two or more peaks to identify greatly increases the confi-
dence that can be placed in an elemental identification. This is 
especially valuable when peak interference occurs between 
two elements. For example, a severe interference occurs 
between S&nbsp; K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 (2.307&nbsp; keV) and Mo L
</p>
<p>3
-M
</p>
<p>4,5
 (2.293&nbsp; keV), 
</p>
<p>which are separated by 14&nbsp;eV.&nbsp;To confirm the presence of Mo 
when S may also be present, operation with E
</p>
<p>0
 &gt; 25&nbsp; keV 
</p>
<p>(U
0
 = 1.25) will also excite Mo K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 (17.48&nbsp;keV) for unam-
</p>
<p>biguous identification of Mo.
When the beam energy is lowered to the bottom of the con-
</p>
<p>ventional analysis range, E
0
 = 10&nbsp;keV, the available X-ray shells 
</p>
<p>for measurement are reduced as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 22.4. Many 
more elements can only be analyzed with X-rays from one shell, 
for example, the Ni to Rb L-shells and the Hf to U M-shells.

<p>creates the situation shown in . Fig.&nbsp;22.5. At 5&nbsp;keV, only 
one shell is available for all elements except Ca, Cd, In, 
and Sn. When the incident energy is reduced below 5&nbsp;keV, 
some elements are effectively rendered analytically inac-
cessible by the restrictions imposed by the X-ray physics. 
The progressive loss of access to elements in the periodic 
table is illustrated for E
</p>
<p>0
 = 2.5&nbsp;keV (. Fig.&nbsp;22.6), E
</p>
<p>0
 = 2&nbsp;keV 
</p>
<p>(. Fig.&nbsp; 22.7), and E
0
 = 1&nbsp; keV (. Fig.&nbsp; 22.8). Indeed, even 
</p>
<p>with E
0
 = 5&nbsp;keV, several elements must be measured with 
</p>
<p>X-rays from shells with low fluorescence yield, such as the 
Ti L-family&nbsp; and the Ba M-family, resulting in poor 
peak-to-background.
</p>
<p>Based upon the restrictions imposed by the physics of 
X-ray generation, E
</p>
<p>0
 = 5&nbsp;keV is the lowest energy which still 
</p>
<p>gives access to the full periodic table, except for H and He, 
and therefore this value will be considered as the upper 
bound of the beam energy range for low beam energy micro-
analysis. The beam energy range from 5&nbsp;keV to&nbsp;10&nbsp;keV repre-
sents the transition region between low beam energy 
microanalysis and conventional X-ray microanalysis.

</p>
<p>22.2.1  Improved Spatial Resolution
</p>
<p>The spatial resolution of X-ray microanalysis is controlled by 
the range of the electrons for the excitation of characteristic 
X-rays, as described by the Kanaya&ndash;Okayama (1974) range 
equation modified for the threshold of X-ray production set 
by the critical excitation energy:

</p>
<p>22.2.2  Reduced Matrix Absorption 
Correction
</p>
<p>When the range of X-ray production is reduced by lowering 
the beam energy, the generated X-rays undergo lower absorp-
tion because of the reduced path length to the surface. This 
can be a strong effect, because X-ray absorption follows an 
exponential relationship:
</p>
<p>I / I exp /
0
</p>
<p>s= &minus; &micro; ρ ρ( )   (22.6)
</p>
<p>where I
0
 is the original intensity and I is the intensity 
</p>
<p>remaining after passing through a distance s (cm) of a mate-
rial of density ρ (g/cm3) and of mass absorption coefficient, 
μ/ρ (cm2/g). For strongly absorbed photons, which is 
</p>
<p>typically the case for low energy photons, the matrix correc-
tion for absorption diminishes rapidly (i.e., approaches 
unity) as the beam energy is reduced, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;22.10

</p>
<p>22.2.3  Accurate Analysis of&nbsp;Low Atomic 
Number Elements at Low Beam 
Energy
</p>
<p>Low atomic number elements with Z &le; 10 have characteristic 
X-ray energies below 1&nbsp;keV, and these low energy photons 
suffer especially high absorption. By minimizing absorption 
through operation at low beam energy, Li and Be can be 
detected; and B, C, N, and F, can be quantitatively analyzed 
with accuracy such that the analyzed value is generally 
within &plusmn; 5 % relative to the true value, as presented in

<p>22.3  Challenges and&nbsp;Limitations of&nbsp;Low 
Beam Energy X-Ray Microanalysis
</p>
<p>22.3.1  Reduced Access to&nbsp;Elements
</p>
<p>High performance SEMs can routinely operate with the 
beam energy as low as 500&nbsp;eV; and with special electron 
optics and/or stage biasing, the landing kinetic energy of 
the beam can be reduced to 10&nbsp;eV.&nbsp;Because the beam pen-
etration depth decreases rapidly as the incident energy is 
reduced, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;22.9, which plots the Kanaya&ndash;
Okayama range for 0&nbsp;&ndash; 5&nbsp;keV, low kinetic energy provides 
extreme sensitivity to the surface of the specimen, which 
</p>
<p>can improve the contrast from surface features of interest. 
Since the lateral ranges over which the backscattered elec-
tron (BSE) and closely related SE
</p>
<p>2
 signals are emitted are 
</p>
<p>also greatly restricted at low beam energies, these signals 
closely approach the beam footprint of SE
</p>
<p>1
 emission and 
</p>
<p>thus contribute to high spatial resolution imaging rather 
than degrading resolution as they do at high beam energy. 
Thus, low beam energy operation has strong advantages 
for SEM imaging down to beam landing energies of tens 
of eV.
</p>
<p>While low beam energy SEM imaging can exploit the 
full range of landing kinetic energies to seek to maximize 
contrast from surface features of interest, the situation for

</p>
<p>low beam energy X-ray microanalysis is much more con-
strained. As discussed above, as the beam energy is reduced, 
the atomic shells that can be ionized become more 
restricted. A beam energy of 5&nbsp;keV is the lowest energy that 
provides access to measureable X-rays for elements of the 
periodic table from Z = 3 (Li) to Z = 94 (Pu), as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 22.5. If the beam energy is reduced to E
</p>
<p>0
 = 2.5&nbsp;keV, 
</p>
<p>EDS X-ray microanalysis of large portions of the periodic 
table is no longer possible because no atomic shell with use-
ful X-ray yield can be excited or effectively measured for 
these elements, creating the situation shown in . Fig.&nbsp;22.6. 
Further decreases in the beam energy results in losing 
access to even more elements, with only about half of the 
elements measureable at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 1&nbsp;keV, and many of those only 
</p>
<p>marginally so.
Even to achieve the elemental coverage depicted for 
</p>
<p>E
0
 = 5&nbsp;keV in . Fig.&nbsp;22.5, low beam energy EDS X-ray micro-
</p>
<p>analysis requires measurement of characteristic X-rays that 
are not normally utilized in conventional beam energy analy-
sis for certain elements. Thus Ti must be measured with the 
Ti L-family when E
</p>
<p>0
 &le; 5&nbsp; keV, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 22.15. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, for Ba, the Ba L-family around 4.5&nbsp;keV is the usual 
choice for microanalysis, but the Ba L
</p>
<p>3
 excitation energy is 
</p>
<p>5.25&nbsp;keV, and thus the Ba L-family not excited with E
0
 = 5&nbsp;keV, 
</p>
<p>forcing the analyst to utilize the Ba M-family. The EDS 
</p>
<p>spectrum of BaCl
2
 with E
</p>
<p>0
 = 5&nbsp;keV is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;22.16. 
</p>
<p>Due to the low fluorescence yield of ionizations in the Ba 
M-shell, the Ba M-family peaks are seen to have a relatively 
low peak-to- background, despite Ba being present in this 
case as a major constituent (mass concentration C = 0.696), 
making the measurement of Ba when present as a minor to 
trace constituent even more problematic. A practical prob-
lem that arises when analyzing with the Ba M-family peaks is 
the difficulty in obtaining suitable Ba M-family peak refer-
ences that are free of interferences from other elements. 
While BaCl
</p>
<p>2
 is interference- free in the Ba M-family region, 
</p>
<p>BaF
2
 and BaCO
</p>
<p>3
 are not, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;22.16. However, 
</p>
<p>BaCl
2
 shows evidence of degradation under the electron 
</p>
<p>beam, possibly changing the local compositions and thus dis-
qualifying it as a standard. Despite degradation under the 
beam, BaCl
</p>
<p>2
 can serve as a peak reference, while BaF
</p>
<p>2
 or 
</p>
<p>another Ba-containing compound or glass that is stable 
under electron bombardment can serve as a standard.

<p>22.3.2  Relative Depth of&nbsp;X-Ray Generation: 
Susceptibility to&nbsp;Vertical 
Heterogeneity
</p>
<p>Another challenge in low beam energy X-ray microanalysis is 
that the difference in the depth of generation and sampling of 
characteristic X-rays from different elements imposes strong 
requirements on the homogeneity of the specimen along the 
beam axis. While the physics of characteristic X-ray genera-
tion is such that relative differences in the generation and 
emission of X-rays occur at all beam energies, including the 
conventional beam energy range, in the low beam energy 
analysis region the effect is exacerbated due to the rapidly 
changing range as described by Eq. (22.5). It is useful to con-
sider that the photon energy axis of an EDS spectrum can 
also be thought of as a range axis that describes the depth to 
</p>
<p>which a given photon energy can be generated. Such a range 
scale is shown parallel to the photon energy axis in . Fig.&nbsp;22.18 
for a ZnS target with E
</p>
<p>0
 = 5&nbsp; keV.&nbsp; Points on the Kanaya&ndash;
</p>
<p>Okayama range scale corresponding to exciting X-rays with 
ionization energies of 4&nbsp;keV, 3&nbsp;keV, 2&nbsp;keV and 1&nbsp;keV are noted. 
The range scale is non-linear when compared to the energy 
scale due to the E
</p>
<p>0
1.67 term in the range equation. In ZnS, S K 
</p>
<p>(E
c
 = 2.47&nbsp; keV) can be excited to a depth of approximately 
</p>
<p>0.21&nbsp; μm, while Zn (E
c
 = 1.02&nbsp; keV) continues to a depth of 
</p>
<p>0.28&nbsp;μm. If the ZnS contained Ca as a trace or minor constitu-
ent, it would only be generated to a depth of 0.09&nbsp;μm. Thus, if 
quantitative analysis is to be successful by means of the 
k-ratio/matrix corrections protocol performed at a single 
beam energy in the low beam energy regime, the material 
must be homogeneous from the surface to the full range of 
the excited volume.

<p>22.3.3  At Low Beam Energy, Almost 
Everything Is Found To&nbsp;Be&nbsp;Layered
</p>
<p>Most &ldquo;pure&rdquo; elements have surface layers such as native oxide, 
hydration layers, and others that compromise the require-
ment for uniform composition throughout the&nbsp; electron- 
excited volume of both the unknown and the standard(s). For 
example, when &ldquo;pure&rdquo; silicon is used as a standard, the inten-
sity of the O K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 peak, which arises from the SiO
</p>
<p>2
 layer on 
</p>
<p>Si, increases relative to the Si K-L
2,3
</p>
<p> peak as the beam energy 
is lowered, as seen in . Fig.&nbsp; 22.19. In conventional analysis 
with E
</p>
<p>0
 &ge; 10&nbsp;keV, the deviation from &ldquo;pure&rdquo; silicon that this 
</p>
<p>surface oxide represents does not constitute a significant 
source of error since the range is so much greater than the 
native oxide thickness. However, for low beam energy analy-
sis, the surface oxide constitutes an increasingly significant 
fraction of the beam excitation volume as the beam energy is 
reduced, introducing an increasingly larger error because of 
the uncertainty in the standard composition.
</p>
<p>The presence of the O K-L
2,3
</p>
<p> peak from a surface oxide is 
especially problematic when it interferes with the characteristic 
peak of interest, such as the Ti L-family, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;22.20. 
O K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 (0.525&nbsp;keV) is separated from Ti L
</p>
<p>1
-M
</p>
<p>2
 (0.529&nbsp;keV) by 
</p>
<p>4&nbsp;eV.&nbsp;Note the large increase in intensity in this region as the 
beam energy is lowered from 10&nbsp; keV to 2.5&nbsp; keV due to the 
increased contribution from O K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 as the fraction of the 
</p>
<p>interaction volume represented by the surface oxide increases. 
Obtaining an adequate standard and peak reference for Ti for 
low beam energy analysis is thus problematic. Even when a 
compound expected to be oxygen-free such as TiSi
</p>
<p>2
 is selected, 
</p>
<p>there still appears to be excess intensity due to O K-L
2,3
</p>
<p>, as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;22.20. Thus, it may be necessary to use advanced 
preparation, such as in situ ion milling to clean the surface of Ti 
to reduce the oxygen contribution to the spectrum.
</p>
<p>The conductive coating that is applied to eliminate surface 
charging in insulating specimens becomes more significant 
as the beam energy is decreased. This effect is illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp;22.21 for spectra of the mineral benitoite (BaTiSi
</p>
<p>3
O
</p>
<p>9
) 
</p>
<p>recorded over a wide range of incident beam energies, where 
the peak for C K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 is barely detectable at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV but 
</p>
<p>becomes one of the most prominent peaks in the spectrum at 
E
</p>
<p>0
 = 2.5&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;The analyst should try to minimize the carbon 
</p>
<p>contribution to the spectrum by using the thinnest acceptable 
carbon layer, less than 10&nbsp;nm thick, and it may be necessary 
to explore the use of ultrathin (~1&nbsp;nm) heavy metal coatings 
as an alternative if it is desired to analyze for carbon.

<p>Finding an unexpected composition due to surface modi-
fication is a common experience when performing low beam 
energy analysis of materials that must be analyzed in the as- 
received condition. Without special surface preparation to 
expose the interior of the material, such as grinding and pol-
ishing or ion beam milling, the modified surface region dom-
inates the analysis. . Figure&nbsp;22.22 (upper spectrum) shows an 
example of TiB
</p>
<p>2
, where inspection of the fitting residual after 
</p>
<p>analyzing for B and Ti shows significant peaks for C and 
O.&nbsp;When these elements are included in the analysis, the fit-
ting residual shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 22.22 (lower spectrum) is 
</p>
<p>obtained, showing no further undiscovered constituents. The 
analysis results presented in . Table&nbsp; 22.6 reveal significant 
concentrations of C and O in the TiB
</p>
<p>2
. Note the greater vari-
</p>
<p>ance in the C and O contaminants compared to the B and Ti 
host elements.
</p>
<p> Analysis of&nbsp;Surface Contamination
</p>
<p>Low beam energy analysis samples such a shallow near- 
surface region that unexpected contamination layers can 
dominate an analysis. This can lead to the confounding situa-
tion where the analysis can be correct, but what is being

<p>measured is unanticipated. An example is shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;22.23, which shows a low beam energy SDD-EDS spec-
trum of NIST SRM 481 (alloy 20Au-80Ag) where the surface 
was prepared metallographically more than 30 years earlier. 
The spectrum shows distinct peaks due to S and Cl from the 
formation of a surface tarnish layer. Quantitative X-ray 
microanalysis with DTSA-II confirms the high concentra-
tions of S and Cl and very large RDEV values for Ag and Au, 
as shown in . Table&nbsp;22.7a. The specimen mount was re-pol-
ished with 0.25- μm diamond abrasive, which eliminated the 
S- and Cl- rich layer, as seen in the spectrum in . Fig.&nbsp;22.23. 
</p>
<p>The results of the quantitative analysis after this first repolish-
ing, which are presented in . Table&nbsp; 22.7b, show analytical 
totals near unity but large RDEV values for Ag and Au, espe-
cially for the 20Au-80Ag alloy. This large deviation from the 
SRM values is likely to be a consequence of the tarnish forma-
tion process selectively removing Ag from the alloy. After two 
additional repolishing steps with 1&nbsp;μm and 0.25&nbsp;μm diamond 
abrasives (. Tables&nbsp;22.7c and 22.7d), this perturbed surface 
layer was finally removed, exposing the SRM alloy, with the 
DTSA-II analysis values closely matching the SRM certificate 
values.

<p>between the unknown and the standard(s) is that the 
composition is different. No other factors such as the 
specimen shape, orientation, or size influence the 
measured X-ray spectrum.
</p>
<p> 2. The specimen is homogeneous in composition over the 
volume excited by the electron beam from which the 
characteristic and continuum X-rays are emitted, 
including the secondary radiation induced by absorption 
of the primary electron-excited radiation.
</p>
<p>When either of these conditions is not met, a significant 
increase in the overall uncertainty budget of the analysis can 
occur beyond the ideal situation in which the uncertainties 
arise from counting statistics and from uncertainties in the 
calculated matrix correction factors.
</p>
<p>Considering &ldquo;zeroth-level&rdquo; assumption 1, sample geom-
etry can significantly modify the measured X-ray intensity. 
The ideal specimen is flat and placed at known angles to the 
incident beam and the X-ray detector(s). Topographic fea-
tures on bulk specimens (defined as those for which the 
thickness is much greater than the electron range) or 
unusual geometric shapes, such as particles with dimensions 
similar to the electron range, can strongly affect the mea-
sured X-rays by modifying X-ray generation and by affect-
ing the loss of X-rays due to absorption. In severe cases, the 
impact of &ldquo;geometric factors&rdquo; on the final concentrations 
becomes so large as to render the compositional results, as 
calculated with the conventional standards-based/matrix 
corrections protocol or the standardless protocol, nearly 
worthless.
</p>
<p>23.1  The Origins of&nbsp;&ldquo;Geometric Effects&rdquo;: 
Bulk Specimens
</p>
<p>The ideal sample is compositionally homogeneous on a 
microscopic scale, has a flat surface, and is set at known 
angles to the incident electron beam and the X-ray spectrom-
eter. Compared to the X-ray spectrum measured from this 
ideal spectrum, geometric effects occur when the size and 
shape of the specimen (1) modify the interaction of the elec-
trons with the specimen so as to affect the generated X-ray 
intensity and (2) alter the length of the absorption path along 
which the generated X-rays travel to escape the specimen and 
reach the detector so as to affect the measured X-ray 
intensity.
</p>
<p>Because electron backscattering depends on the local sur-
face inclination to the incident beam, tilted samples generate 
fewer X-rays compared to a sample at normal beam inci-
dence (0&deg; tilt). An illustration of this effect for bulk copper, as 
calculated with the Monte Carlo simulation embedded in 
NIST DTSA-II, is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;23.1. Even at normal beam 
incidence where the backscattered electron (BSE) coefficient 
</p>
<p>is at a minimum, BSEs carry off energy which would have 
gone to cause additional inner shell ionization events fol-
lowed by subsequent X-ray emission had those electrons 
remained in the specimen. As the local surface inclination 
(tilt) increases, backscattering increases and more X-ray gen-
eration is lost compared to normal beam incidence situation.

<p>increasing tilt due to the increased backscattering seen in 
. Fig.&nbsp;23.1. There is a relatively small decrease in the k-ratio 
at low tilt angles, but the k-ratio decreases rapidly for tilt 
angles above approximately 40&deg;. Because of the high photon 
energy of Cu K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 (8.04&nbsp;keV) and the relative transparency 
</p>
<p>of any material to its own X-rays, there is no significant 
absorption so that the behavior shown in . Fig.&nbsp;23.2 is almost 
entirely due to the modification of the production of X-rays 
due to backscatter loss.
</p>
<p>Surface topography modifies the X-ray absorption path 
length to the detector compared to a flat specimen at normal 
beam incidence. As shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;23.3, topo-
graphic features such as scratches and ridges can increase or 
decrease the absorption path length in the direction of the 
X-ray detector. X-ray absorption follows an exponential 
dependence on this path length:
</p>
<p>I I/ exp /0 = &minus; ( ) &micro; ρ ρs  (23.1)
</p>
<p>where I
0
 is the initial intensity, I is the intensity that remains 
</p>
<p>after passing through a path length s (cm), (μ/ρ) is the mass 
absorption coefficient (cm2/g) for the photon energy of interest 
that depends on the absorption contributions of all elements 
present, and ρ is the density (g/cm3). Considering the entire 
energy range of the generated X-ray spectrum, which extends 
from a practical minimum threshold of 100&nbsp;eV to the incident 
beam energy, E
</p>
<p>0
 (the Duane&ndash;Hunt limit), as the X-ray photon 
</p>
<p>energy decreases, absorption generally increases. Absorption is 
especially strong if the photon energy is less than 1&nbsp;keV above 
the critical ionization energy for any elemental constituent in 
the specimen. An example of this effect is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;23.4 
</p>

<p>energy for Al, Si is very strongly absorbed by Al (μ/ρ = 3282&nbsp;cm2/g) 
such that there is no penetration beyond approximately 6&nbsp;μm. 
By comparison, Al K-L

<p>2,3

<p>23.2  What Degree of&nbsp;Surface Finish Is 
Required for&nbsp;Electron-Excited X-ray 
Microanalysis To&nbsp;Minimize Geometric 
Effects?
</p>
<p>Early in the history of microanalysis by electron-excited X-ray 
spectrometry, it was recognized that controlling the surface 
condition of a specimen was critical to achieving high-accu-
racy results by reducing geometric effects to a negligible level. 
Yakowitz and Heinrich (1968) performed a series of experi-
ments in which the metallographic preparation sequence of 
grinding and polishing was interrupted at various stages. 
Materials examined included pure elements with two widely 
different characteristic peak energies, for example, Au M
</p>
<p>5
-
</p>
<p>N
6,7
</p>
<p> at 2.123&nbsp;keV and Au L
3
-M
</p>
<p>4,5
 at 9.711&nbsp;keV, and homoge-
</p>
<p>neous binary metal alloys with widely differing characteristic 
X-ray energies. For each surface condition, the characteristic 
X-ray intensity was then measured at random locations and 
along line traverses on the specimen surface to examine the 
variation in characteristic X-ray intensity that could be 
ascribed to surface roughness. Results for selected surface 
conditions for a gold target are listed in . Table&nbsp;23.1. For the 
Au L
</p>
<p>3
-M
</p>
<p>4,5
 measurements, a final polish of the surface with 
</p>
<p>0.5-μm alumina was necessary to reduce the coefficient of 
</p>
<p>variation for 20 random measurements to a level similar to 
the expected variation from the random counting statistics, 
expressed as 3 n1/2/n. For the lower photon energy Au M
</p>
<p>5
-N
</p>
<p>6,7
 
</p>
<p>which suffers stronger absorption, it was necessary to improve 
the surface polish to 0.1&nbsp;μm alumina to achieve similar results.
</p>
<p>For even lower photon energy peaks, such as those asso-
ciated with low atomic number elements with Z &le; 9 (fluo-
rine) for which E &lt; 1&nbsp;keV, even better surface finish is required 
to control the geometric effects. Newbury and Ritchie (2013a) 
simulated X-ray emission from crenelated surfaces with the 
Monte Carlo simulation embedded in NIST DTSA-II to 
examine the influence of surface topography on low photon 
energy peaks. As shown in . Fig.&nbsp;23.5 for FeO at an incident 
beam energy E
</p>
<p>0

</p>
<p>reduced below 50&nbsp;nm to reduce the geometric effects on O K,

 to a negligible level.
</p>
<p>23.2.1  No Chemical Etching

minimize geometric effects, it is also important to avoid 
chemical or electrochemical etching of the final surface. For

</p>
<p>etching is usually required to produce contrast from grains at 
different crystallographic orientations and from composi-
tionally distinct phases by creating surface relief through dif-
ferential chemical attack and dissolution or by staining 
through chemical reactions. Such microscopic physical relief 
creates unwanted topography similar to mechanically pro-
duced scratches that can affect SEM/EDS analysis. 
Additionally, in some cases chemical etching can actually 
modify the chemical composition of the surface region, so 
that it is no longer representative of the bulk of the material.
</p>
<p>23.3  Consequences of&nbsp;Attempting Analysis 
of&nbsp;Bulk Materials With&nbsp;Rough Surfaces
</p>
<p>To illustrate the impact of surface topography on microanal-
ysis results, a microscopically homogenous glass (NIST SRM 
470&nbsp;K411) containing several elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, and 
Fe) that provide a wide range of range of photon energies, as 
listed in . Table&nbsp;23.2, was analyzed with a range of surface 
topography (Newbury and Ritchie 2013b). Analysis was per-
formed with NIST DTSA-II at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV using elemental 
</p>
<p>(Mg, Si, Fe) and multi-element (SRM 470 glass K412 for Ca) 
standards, with oxygen calculated by assumed stoichiometry, 
followed by normalization of the raw result. When analyzed 
in the ideal, highly polished (100-nm alumina final polish) 
flat form, the analyzed concentrations for the Mg and Fe con-
stituents, selected because of their wide difference in photon 
energies, measured at 20 randomly selected locations show 
the distribution of results plotted in . Fig.&nbsp;23.6. The mean of 
the 20 analyses falls within +1.8 % relative for Fe and &minus;1.0 % 
relative for Mg (SRM certificate values). Of the 20 analyzed 
locations, 19 fall within a symmetric cluster that spans 
</p>
<p>approximately 1% relative along the Mg and Fe concentra-
tion axes, while the results for one location fall significantly 
outside this cluster. This anomalous value was found to be 
associated with a shallow scratch that remained on the pol-
ished surface (location noted on the inset SEM image).
</p>
<p>When this highly polished surface was degraded by direc-
tional grinding with 1-μm diamond grit, 20 analyses at ran-
domly selected locations produce a much wider scatter in the 
normalized Mg and Fe concentrations, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;23.7, 
a direct consequence of the effect of surface geometry.
</p>
<p>Creating an even more severe topographic feature by 
gouging the polished surface of K411 with a diamond scribe 
created the crater seen in the SEM(ET+) SE + BSE image 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 23.8a. Many locations in this gouge crater 
were analyzed, and the results are plotted in . Fig.&nbsp; 23.8b, 
showing a very wide range of Mg-Fe results. For comparison, 
note that the 20&nbsp;Mg-Fe results from the highly polished sur-
face, including the outlier seen In . Fig.&nbsp;23.6, are contained 
within the small red box noted on the plot in . Fig.&nbsp;23.8b.

<p>. Figure&nbsp;23.9a shows examples of additional  geometric 
shapes created with K411 glass: deep, narrow pits from 
diamond scribe impacts, microscopic particles (major 
dimen sions &lt; 100&nbsp; μm), and macroscopic particles (major 
dimensions &gt; 500&nbsp; μm). When random locations are ana-
lyzed on these targets, the range of measured Mg and Fe 
 concentration values is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;23.9b, covering an 
order of magnitude in both constituents. This huge range 
occurs with EDS spectra that were readily measurable 
despite the severe departure from the ideal flat specimen 
geometry.
</p>
<p>These results demonstrate that the SEM microanalyst 
must realize that just because an EDS spectrum can be 
obtained when the stationary beam is placed on a topo-
graphic feature of interest, the resulting analysis may be sub-
ject to such egregious errors so as to be of little use. 
Sometimes analysis locations that are surprisingly close on a 
microscopic scale can produce very different results. 
. Figure&nbsp; 23.10 shows a fractured fragment of pyrite (stoi-
chiometric FeS
</p>
<p>2
) which has been analyzed at various loca-
</p>
<p>tions (conditions: E
0
 = 20&nbsp;keV; DTSA-II calculations with Fe 
</p>
<p>and CuS as standards, followed by normalization). Despite 
the proximity of the analyzed locations, the results vary 
greatly. Thus, analysis at location 3 produces a nearly perfect 
match to the stoichiometric values with relative deviation 
from expected value (RDEV) within &plusmn;0.15 %, while analysis 
at nearby location 9 (about 25&nbsp; μm away) suffers relative 
accuracy of &plusmn;36 %, while at location 7 (about 50&nbsp;μm away) 
the RDEV is &plusmn;100 %.
</p>
<p>kThe Takeaway
</p>
<p>Just because a feature can be observed in an SEM image and 
an EDS spectrum can be recorded does not mean that a suc-
cessful and useful quantitative analysis can be performed!
</p>
<p>23.4  Useful Indicators of&nbsp;Geometric Factors 
Impact on&nbsp;Analysis
</p>
<p>There are strong diagnostic indicators that reveal the impact 
of geometric factors on analysis:
</p>
<p>23.4.1  The Raw Analytical Total
</p>
<p>The raw analytical total is the sum of all the constituents 
measured (including any constituents such as oxygen calcu-
lated on the basis of assumed stoichiometry of the cations). 
For an ideal flat sample measured with the beam energy 
selected in the &ldquo;conventional range&rdquo; (E
</p>
<p>0
 = 10&nbsp;keV to 25&nbsp;keV) 
</p>
<p>and following a standards-based&ndash;matrix correction factor 
protocol, the analytical total typically will fall between 0.98 
and 1.02 mass fraction (98&ndash;102&nbsp;wt %), a consequence of the 
uncertainties inherent in the measurement process (counting 
statistics) and in the calculated matrix correction factors. If 
the raw analytical total exceeds this range, it is usually an 
indication of a deviation in the measurement conditions 
(e.g., beam current drift). If the raw analytical total is below 
this range, this may again indicate a deviation in the

<p>measurement conditions, but a low total can also reveal the 
presence on an unexpected elemental constituent that is not 
in the list of elements analyzed. For example, an oxidized 
inclusion in a metallic alloy will typically have an oxygen 
mass fraction of approximately 0.3, leading to a sharp 
decrease in the analytical total to ~ 0.7 (70 %) if oxygen is not 
recognized and included in a standards-based analysis of that 
location compared to the surrounding metallic region. Thus, 
even for conventional analysis of ideal specimens, the raw 
analytical total conveys useful information and should always 
be inspected.
</p>
<p>When a specimen deviates from the ideal flat condition and 
geometric factors affect the analysis, the raw analytical total 
gives a direct indication, providing a standards-based&ndash;matrix 
correction factor protocol is being used. Note that &ldquo;standard-
less analysis&rdquo; does not provide this critical information on the 
raw analytical total if this protocol reqwuires a forced normal-
ization to unity mass fraction (100&nbsp; wt %) since the electron 
dose information is not considered. &ldquo;Standardless analysis&rdquo; 
schemes that use a locally measured elemental spectrum to 
establish the dose relationship to the vendor&rsquo;s standard inten-
sity database or which use the peak-to-background method 
(see below) can provide a meaningful analytical total. 
. Figures&nbsp;23.11a, b shows the calculated normalized concentra-
tions as a function of the raw analytical total for Mg and Fe in 
K411 from the suite of spectra obtained from the various 
</p>
<p>geometric shapes. Note that for this data set, the raw analytical 
total varies from 0.03 to 1.30 mass fraction (3&ndash;130 weight wt 
%). For this particular composition (K411 glass), the RDEV for 
Mg and Fe is within a range of 10% relative when the analytical 
total is in the range 0.8&ndash;1.2 mass fraction (80&ndash;120&nbsp; wt %). 
Different compositions are likely to have different sensitivities 
to deviations in accuracy, but the general experience is that 
when the raw analytical total ranges from 0.9 to 1.1 mass frac-
tion (90&ndash;110&nbsp;wt %), the impact of the geometric factors on the 
analysis will be minimized.
</p>
<p>23.4.2  The Shape of&nbsp;the&nbsp;EDS Spectrum
</p>
<p>A second powerful indicator that can alert the careful analyst to 
the possible impact of geometric factors on an analysis is the 
shape of the EDS spectrum. The shape of the X-ray continuum 
(bremsstrahlung) background from an ideal flat specimen has 
distinctive properties. Consider the spectrum of pure boron, 
selected because of the absence of significant characteristic 
peaks above the energy of boron (0.185&nbsp; keV), as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;23.12. A small peak of oxygen that arises from the inevi-
table surface oxide on the boron can be seen in this spectrum, as 
well as the artifact silicon peak from the absorption and internal 
fluorescence of the silicon window support grid and the silicon 
dead layer of the detector. Otherwise, the spectrum consists

<p>background, making it more difficult to discern the position 
of the bremsstrahlung maximum. Nevertheless, the general 
shape of the EDS bremsstrahlung continuum is a powerful 
indicator of geometric effects that modify X-ray produc-
tion, both bremsstrahlung and characteristic X-rays. 
. Figure&nbsp;23.13 shows this effect for ideal flat polished K411 
glass and several shards. The deviation in spectral shape 
from the ideal case is readily apparent, and analysis of spec-
tra with such severe deviations in shape results in large 
deviations in the relative accuracy of the normalized quan-
titative results.
</p>
<p>23.5  Best Practices for&nbsp;Analysis of&nbsp;Rough 
Bulk Samples
</p>
<p>The optimum approach to the analysis of a rough specimen is 
obviously to prepare a polished flat surface, but the analyst 
may be confronted with a situation where no physical modi-
fication of the as-received specimen is permitted. That is, the 
rough surface itself is the object of interest, so that grinding 
</p>
<p>and polishing would modify or destroy the material that is 
actually necessary for the final result. How should the analyst 
proceed in such a case?
</p>
<p>The analysis of rough surfaces is inevitably going to be 
compromised compared to analysis of the ideal flat polished 
specimen. The analyst must seek to obtain the best possible 
result under the circumstances, so the analytical strategy 
must be carefully considered. Electrons that backscatter off 
rough surfaces are likely to produce remote excitation of 
X-rays from material(s) that are likely to differ from the 
location where the beam is striking, as shown schematically 
in . Fig.&nbsp;23.14. It may be thought that the collimator on the 
EDS will restrict the view of the EDS to just the region 
directly excited by the incident beam. This is not the case. 
The collimator typically permits acceptance of X-rays with 
at least 50 % efficiency from an area that is 5&nbsp;mm in diameter 
or larger. The exact transmission response depends on the 
particular EDS detector and its collimator, but the region of 
transmission can be readily determined by mapping a uni-
form target, for example, an aluminum SEM mounting stub, 
at the lowest magnification setting (maximum sized scan

<p>field) of the SEM, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;23.15. The aluminum 
stub was mapped with the specimen plane located at the 
manufacturer&rsquo;s specified ideal working distance for this 
SEM/EDS.&nbsp; The Al intensity map encoded with a pseudo-
color scale shows that the transmission varies from maxi-
mum (100 %) along the top of the image to values in the 
range 60&ndash;70 % at the bottom. The top-to-bottom asymme-
try in this map reveals that the collimator on this EDS sys-
tem is actually misaligned, since with proper orientation the 
maximum of the collimator transmission should be at the 
image center (coincident with the optic axis). The transmis-
sion function of the collimator as a function of vertical dis-
tance along the SEM optical axis can be determined by 
repeating the mapping at different working distances. The 
graph in . Fig.&nbsp; 23.15 shows the intensity measured at the 
center of each map, revealing a decrease of approximately 
40 % as the working distance was increased from 10&nbsp; to 
20&nbsp;mm. This collimator thus allows high transmission from 
a large volume of space, with dimensions of at least 
3&nbsp;&times; 2.5&nbsp;&times; 10&nbsp;mm, so that any X-rays produced in this volume 
with a line-of-sight to the EDS detector will contribute to 
the measured spectrum.
</p>
<p>Optimizing the EDS spectrum measured from a rough, 
irregularly shaped surface requires careful consideration of 
the selection of the location on the specimen to be measured. 
The analyst must be aware of the location of the EDS relative 
to the measured location to avoid the situation illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp;23.16a, where the beam location leads to an X-ray path 
that must pass through the bulk of the specimen to reach the 
EDS, leading to extremely high absorption. Ideally, using a 
specimen stage with several rotation axes, a rotation about a 
vertical axis will bring the feature of interest to directly face 
the EDS, thus minimizing the absorption, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 23.16b. A further rotation about a horizontal axis 
places the feature perpendicular to beam to minimize back-
scattering and remote X-ray excitation (. Fig.&nbsp;23.16c). Note 
that although backscattering is minimized by establishing 
normal beam incidence (effectively a zero tilt angle), the 
backscattered electrons are broadly emitted with a cosine dis-
tribution so that while the majority are emitted at high angles 
there still remains a small but significant fraction emitted at 
low angles to the surface that may strike nearby features and 
excite the surrounding materials, contributing to the spec-
trum measured at the beam impact position.

</p>
<p>23.6.1  How Do X-ray Measurements 
of&nbsp;Particles Differ From&nbsp;Bulk 
Measurements?
</p>
<p>The analysis of microscopic particles whose dimensions 
approach or are smaller than the interaction volume in a 
bulk target of the same composition is subject to effects simi-
lar to analyzing rough, bulk surfaces but with additional 
challenges. Like the rough bulk case, the curved or locally 
</p>
<p>tilted surface of a particle acts to modify electron backscat-
tering, which alters X-ray production, while deviations from 
the ideal flat surface alter the X-ray path to the detector, 
which modifies X-ray absorption compared to a flat bulk tar-
get. The geometry of a particle leads to additional loss of 
beam electrons due to penetration through the sides and 
bottom of the particle, as shown in the DTSA-II Monte Carlo 
simulations in . Fig.&nbsp; 23.17, which depict trajectories in a 
1&nbsp;μm-diameter aluminum particle at different beam ener-
gies. At the highest energy simulated, E

<p>scattering. As the beam energy is lowered and the electron 
range decreases, penetration through the bottom and sides 
diminishes, and at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 5&nbsp;keV the interaction volume is com-
</p>
<p>pletely contained within the 1-μm-diameter aluminum par-
ticle. The beam penetration effect also depends on the 
particle size, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;23.18 for particles of various 
sizes at E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV, and on composition, as shown for parti-
</p>
<p>cles with a range of atomic numbers in . Fig.&nbsp;23.19. Moreover, 
as opposed to the backscattered electrons in the high angle 
portion of the cosine distribution which are likely to leave 
the vicinity of the particle without further interaction, the 
beam electrons that penetrate through the sides and bottom 
of the particle are likely to reach the supporting substrate 
where they will create X-rays of the substrate material that 
contribute to the overall spectrum measured. This effect can 
be seen in . Fig.&nbsp;23.20, which shows the Al and C peaks cal-
culated by the Monte Carlo simulation for 1-μm diameter Al 
spherical particles. At a beam energy of E
</p>
<p>0
 = 5&nbsp;keV, the elec-
</p>
<p>tron trajectories are contained within the particle which 
effectively acts like a bulk target. No electrons penetrate the 
sides or bottom to reach the substrate so there is no C contri-
bution to the EDS spectrum. With increasing incident 
</p>
<p>energy, electron penetration through the particle into the 
substrate occurs, and the C peak of the substrate increases 
relative to the Al-peak from the particle.
</p>
<p>23.6.2  Collecting Optimum Spectra 
From&nbsp;Particles
</p>
<p>Before meaningful qualitative and quantitative analysis of 
particles can be attempted, it is important to optimize the 
EDS spectrum that is collected. As illustrated in the trajec-
tory plots in the Monte Carlo simulations shown in 
. Figs.&nbsp; 23.17, 23.18, and 23.19, and the calculated spectra 
shown in 23.20, because of the impact of particle size and 
shape (geometry) on electron interactions, the EDS spec-
trum of a particle will always be compromised compared to 
the spectrum of a material of identical composition in the 
ideal flat, bulk form. The analyst must be aware of the major 
factors that modify particle spectra and seek to minimize 
these effects. The particle spectrum can be optimized through 
careful sample preparation and by understanding of the fac-
tors that affect the strategy for beam placement.

</p>
<p> Particle Sample Preparation: Bulk Substrate
</p>
<p>Because beam electrons can penetrate through the sides and 
bottom of a particle and reach the underlying substrate, the 
measured spectrum will always be a composite of contribu-
tions from the particle and the substrate, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;23.21 for a K411 glass particle (~1&nbsp;μm in diameter) on 
a bulk carbon substrate. To obtain a spectrum that is repre-
sentative of the particle material alone, it is important when-
ever possible to choose a substrate consisting of an element(s) 
not contained in the particle of interest. As part of a quality 
measurement system, the EDS spectrum of the blank sub-
strate material should be measured to determine what ele-
ments are present at the major, minor, and trace level. 
Additionally, it is desirable that the characteristic peak(s) of 
the substrate element(s) should not interfere with character-
istic peaks from the constituents of the particle.
</p>
<p>Carbon is an excellent choice for a bulk substrate since it is 
available in high purity, is mechanically robust, and supplied 
by various vendors as planchets with different surface finishes, 
including a highly polished, glassy surface that is nearly fea-
tureless as a background for SEM imaging of small particles. 
The low energy of the C K X-ray (0.285&nbsp;keV) is unlikely to 
cause interference with most elements of interest. In addition 
to bulk substrates, carbon is often used in the form of carbon-
infused tape with a sticky surface to which particles will read-
ily adhere. If a carbon tape preparation is used, the analyst 
</p>
<p>must measure a blank spectrum of the tape since the polymer 
base of the tape frequently contains elements such as oxygen 
in addition to carbon. If carbon is of analytical interest, other 
low atomic number substrates are available, including high 
purity boron and beryllium (but beware of the health hazard 
of handling beryllium, especially in the form of beryllium 
oxide which may be released by surface abrasion). Other pure 
element substrates such as aluminum and silicon can be used 
if that element(s) is not of interest, but because of the high 
degree of excitation of the Al K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 and Si K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 characteris-
</p>
<p>tic X-rays under typical operating conditions, a significant 
fraction of the EDS deadtime will be taken up by the substrate 
X-rays, diminishing the analytical information collected per 
unit time on the particle of interest, as well as contributing 
coincidence peaks that might be misinterpreted as minor or 
trace constituents, for example, 2 Al K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 (2.974&nbsp;keV) is close 
</p>
<p>to the energy of Ag L

-M
</p>
<p>4,5
 (2.981&nbsp; keV) and 2 Si K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 
</p>
<p>(3.480&nbsp;keV) is close to the energy of Sn L
3
-M
</p>
<p>4,5
 (3.440&nbsp;keV)
</p>
<p>When depositing particles on a substrate, the area density 
should be minimized to avoid situations where electrons 
scattered off the particle being analyzed can strike nearby 
particles and excite X-rays, which will then contribute an 
artifact (&ldquo;cross talk&rdquo;). While this remote excitation is likely to 
be at the equivalent of a minor or trace level constituent, it is 
critical to understand such contributions when low level con-
stituents are of interest.

</p>
<p> Particle Sample Preparation: Minimizing 
Substrate Contributions With&nbsp;a&nbsp;Thin Foil 
Substrate
</p>
<p>As the particle dimensions decrease below 1&nbsp; μm, electron 
penetration through the particle increases dramatically, rais-
ing the substrate contribution to the X-ray spectrum. Even if 
the characteristic peak(s) of the substrate material is not of 
interest and can be ignored, the deadtime due to the substrate 
spectrum will eventually dominate the overall spectrum 
measurement, even if the substrate consists of carbon which 
is relatively poorly excited. Moreover, the contribution of the 
substrate to the composite spectrum occurs not only from 
the characteristic peak(s), for example, C K, but also from the 
continuum background (bremsstrahlung) which affects all 
photon energies. Increased background from the substrate 
has the effect of lowering the peak-to-background for all 
characteristic peaks from the elements of the particle, which 
degrades all aspects of quantitative analysis but especially 
impacts the limit of detection, raising the minimum concen-
tration that can be reliably measured.
</p>
<p>The substrate contribution to the composite spectrum can 
be minimized by reducing the mass of the substrate. Fine par-
ticles, especially those with nanometer dimensions, can be dis-
persed by various methods, including air-jetting or deposition 
from fluid drops, onto thin carbon films, typically 20&nbsp;nm in 
thickness, which are supported on a grid (copper, nickel, car-
bon, etc.), as shown in the sequence of images in . Fig.&nbsp;23.22. 
To further stabilize the particle deposit, it is typical practice to 
apply a thin (&lt;10&nbsp;nm) carbon coating to provide conductivity 
and also to provide some mechanical constraint. The contri-
bution to the spectrum from the thin carbon support film plus 
the final coating is much reduced compared to the situation on 
a bulk or thick tape carbon substrate, as shown in the com-
parison of spectra from K411 particles of similar size (~1&nbsp;μm 
in diameter) shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 23.21. Beam electrons that are 
scattered laterally from particles can excite the material of the 
grid, as shown by the presence of copper in the K411 particle 
spectrum of . Fig.&nbsp;23.21, but if this system radiation is prob-
lematic, this unwanted spectral contribution can be controlled 
by choosing alternative grid materials, such as carbon.

</p>
<p> The Importance of&nbsp;Beam Placement
</p>
<p>The placement of the beam on the particle relative to the EDS 
detector position can have a strong effect on the measured 
spectrum. For particles of intermediate size where the inter-
action volume is contained within the particle, placing the 
</p>
<p>beam on the side of the particle away from the EDS results in 
an extended absorption path. The generated X-rays must 
pass through a large mass of the particle to reach the detector. 
This effect is illustrated schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;23.23, where 
absorption paths for X-rays generated near the maximum 
penetration of beam electrons in the particle are compared 
for three beam positions: top center, and at positions directly 
facing and away from the EDS.&nbsp;Because absorption follows 
an exponential dependence on path length and becomes 
increasingly significant for low energy photons below 
approximately 4&nbsp;keV, the low energy portion of the spectrum 
will show the strongest absorption effects. Spectra recorded 
at the top of a 5-μm-diameter particle and on the side away 
from the EDS are compared in . Fig.&nbsp;23.24 demonstrating a 
factor of two difference in the intensity measured at the 
energy of Mg K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 (1.254&nbsp;keV). For a beam placed on the 
</p>
<p>curved side of the particle facing the EDS, the absorption 
path length is actually reduced relative to the top center, lead-
ing to extra emission from the low energy photons, creating 
about 30 % excess for Mg K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
, as shown in the comparison 
</p>
<p>of spectra in . Fig.&nbsp;23.25. . Figure&nbsp;23.26 shows the impact of 
beam placement on the accuracy of quantitative analysis, as 
discussed below. It is thus critical that the analyst is always 
aware of the relative position of the EDS in the SEM image 
when choosing locations to analyze. A reliable way to locate 
the EDS is to record an X-ray spectrum image and examine 
selected X-ray intensity maps, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;23.27. The

 (6.930&nbsp;keV) intensity map.
</p>
<p> Overscanning
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overscanning&rdquo; is a strategy by which the beam is continu-
ously scanned over the particle (or rough surface, heteroge-
neous material, etc.) while the EDS spectrum is being 
collected. If the magnification control of the SEM is continu-
ously variable, then the size of the scan raster can be adjusted 
to bracket the particle, minimizing the fraction of the time 
that the beam spends on the surrounding substrate, as shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;23.28 (yellow box). Alternatively, the scan raster can 
be adjusted to fill as much of the particle image as possible 
while remaining within the bounds of the particle, thus 
avoiding direct beam placement on the substrate, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;23.28 (green box).
</p>
<p>While useful for gaining qualitative information on the 
constituents of a particle, overscanning only has utility if the 
particle (or other target object) is homogeneous. Overscanning 
discards valuable information on any possible inhomogeneous 
</p>
<p>structure within the particle. As described below, overscan-
ning is NOT a means by which an &ldquo;average&rdquo; composition can 
be found by quantitative microanalysis.
</p>
<p>23.6.3  X-ray Spectrum Imaging: 
Understanding Heterogeneous 
Materials
</p>
<p>X-ray spectrum imaging (XSI) involves collecting a com-
plete EDS spectrum at every pixel location visited by the 
scanned beam. When applied to particle analysis, the XSI 
provides the analyst with an abundance of information 
which can be recovered by post-collection processing of the 
XSI datacube. Composition heterogeneity down to the sin-
gle pixel level can be detected and interpreted. The particle 
X-ray intensity images shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 23.27a, b were 
extracted from an XSI, and the localization of Ti and Mo in 
inclusions is immediately obvious. Solidification dendrites 
are outlined in the Ti K-L

mation would be lost if these particles were simply over-
scanned. While the XSI collected with a single silicon drift 
</p>
<p>detector (SDD)-EDS inevitably shows the shadowing cre-
ated by specimen geometry, such shadowing can be greatly 
diminished by collecting the XSI with an array of SDD-EDS 
detectors placed symmetrically around the specimen, as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;23.29.

<p>23.6.4  Particle Geometry Factors 
Influencing Quantitative Analysis 
of&nbsp;Particles
</p>
<p>There are two principal &ldquo;particle geometry&rdquo; effects: the &ldquo;par-
ticle mass effect&rdquo; and the &ldquo;particle absorption effect&rdquo; (Small 
et&nbsp;al. 1978, 1979).
</p>
<p> &ldquo;Particle Mass Effect&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The penetration of beam electrons through the side and bot-
tom of a particle reduces the X-ray production compared to 
a flat bulk target, creating the so called &ldquo;particle mass effect.&rdquo; 
. Figure&nbsp;23.30 shows the intensity of Fe K-L
</p>

 produced as a 
</p>
<p>function of sphere diameter for spherical particles of NIST 
SRM (K411), the composition of which is listed in

<p>for an incident beam energy of 20&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;For this plot, the Fe 
K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 intensity emitted from the particle has been divided by 
</p>
<p>the intensity calculated for a flat bulk K411 target to deter-
mine the k-ratio. Note that as the particle diameter increases 
from zero, the Fe K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 k-ratio increases and asymptotically 
</p>
<p>approaches unity (i.e., equivalent to the flat bulk target) for a 
diameter of approximately 10&nbsp;μm. Thus, for the case K411 at 
E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp; keV, bulk behavior for Fe K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 (6.400&nbsp; keV) is 
</p>
<p>observed for spherical particles with diameters of 10&nbsp;μm and 
greater.
</p>
<p> &ldquo;Particle Absorption Effect&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The surface curvature of a particle can reduce the absorption 
path to the detector compared to the interaction volume in a 
flat bulk target, as shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;23.31. Since 
X-ray absorption depends exponentially on the absorption 
path length, surface curvature can significantly modify the 
measured intensity, creating the &ldquo;particle absorption effect.&rdquo; 
The magnitude of the particle absorption effect depends 
strongly on the energy of the characteristic photons involved.

</p>
<p>radiation at 6.40&nbsp;keV is sufficiently energetic that it under-
goes relatively little absorption in the bulk case so that the 
modification of the absorption path length by particle sur-
face curvature produces a negligible effect. However, the 
lower energy characteristic photons such as O K-L
</p>
<p>2
 
</p>
<p>(0.525&nbsp;keV) and Mg K-L
2,3
</p>
<p> (1.254&nbsp;keV) in K411 suffer signifi-
cant absorption in a flat bulk target, so that when these pho-
tons are generated in a spherical particle, the reduced 
absorption path in the direction toward the EDS leads to an 
increase in X-ray emission compared to a flat bulk target. 
. Figure&nbsp;23.32 shows that as the particle diameter increases 
from zero, the k-ratios for O K-L
</p>
<p>2
 and Mg K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 initially 
</p>
<p>increase similarly to FeKα as a result of the particle mass 
effect. However, for larger particles the reduced absorption 
path of the curved particle surface causes the emitted O 
K-L
</p>
<p>2
 k-ratio to actually exceed unity (i.e., higher emission 
</p>
<p>than bulk behavior) for a particle diameter of 1.6&nbsp;μm, reach-
ing a maximum of 1.35 relative to bulk at a particle diameter 
of 2.8&nbsp;μm. For Mg K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
, the emission exceeds unity for a 
</p>
<p>particle diameter of 2&nbsp;μm and reaches a maximum of 1.17 at 
a diameter of 3.0&nbsp; μm. For particle diameters beyond the 
intensity maxima, the O K-L
</p>
<p>2
 and Mg K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 k-ratios gradu-
</p>
<p>ally decrease with increasing particle diameter, asymptoti-
cally approaching the equivalent of bulk behavior at 25&nbsp;μm 
diameter for O K-L
</p>
<p>2
, and 18&nbsp; μm diameter for Mg K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
. 
</p>
<p>Thus, for spherical particles of the K-411 composition mea-
sured with E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp;keV, effectively bulk behavior is observed 
</p>
<p>for all characteristic X-ray energies for particles with diame-
ters greater than 25&nbsp;μm for a beam position at the top center 
of the particle (detector take-off angle 40&deg;). As demonstrated 
in . Fig.&nbsp; 23.23, deviations in the beam placement either 
toward the EDS or away have significant effects due to the 
</p>
<p>modification of the absorption path. Particle geometry and 
its impact on X-ray absorption must be considered when 
selecting beam locations on a particle for analysis. It is criti-
cal that the analyst always be aware of the position of the EDS 
detector relative to the X-ray source, as demonstrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp;23.24, to minimize the effects of particle geometry.
</p>
<p>23.6.5  Uncertainty in&nbsp;Quantitative Analysis 
of&nbsp;Particles
</p>
<p>Quantitative analysis of particles is performed by following 
the same k-ratio/matrix correction protocol used for flat, bulk 
specimens. However, it must be recognized that particle 
geometry modification of the interaction of beam electrons 
and the subsequent propagation of X-rays introduce factors 
which violate the fundamental assumption of the bulk quan-
tification method, namely that the only reason the X-ray 
intensities measured in the target being analyzed are different 
from the standards is that the composition(s) is different. 
Thus, with the impact of the geometric factors, the analytical 
accuracy of the conventional k-ratio/matrix correction proto-
col is inevitably compromised. The critical question to con-
sider is the degree to which the uncertainty budget is increased 
by the systematic error contribution of the particle effects.
</p>
<p> The Analytical Total Reveals the&nbsp;Impact 
of&nbsp;Particle Effects
</p>
<p>The analytical total is the sum of the calculated concentra-
tions, including oxygen by stoichiometry if calculated.

<p>Fe, while SRM 470&nbsp;K412 glass was used as the Ca standard. 
The analytical total was 0.9789 (the sum of the SRM certifi-
cate values is 0.9886), and the relative errors were all well 
within the &plusmn;5 % error envelope, with the largest error at 
&minus;2.2 % relative for Ca.
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp; 23.4 gives the results of applying the k-ratio/
matrix correction factor protocol to the analysis of a 
1.3-μm-diameter spherical particle of K411 glass, with the 
EDS spectrum collected with the beam placed at the center of 
the particle image. The intensity of each elemental constitu-
ent has been measured relative to the same suite of standards: 
pure elements Mg, Si, and Fe, and CaF
</p>
<p>2
 as the Ca standard. 
</p>
<p>Oxygen has been calculated by the method of assumed stoi-
chiometry. The analytical total is 0.3480, and the relative 
errors for the raw calculated concentrations are large and 
negative, for example, &minus;70 % relative for Mg and &minus;56 % rela-
tive for Fe. These large negative relative errors (a negative 
relative error indicates that the calculated concentration 
underestimates the true concentration) for both the low pho-
ton energy peaks (e.g., Mg K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 and Si K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
) and the high 
</p>
<p>photon energy peaks (e.g., Ca Kα and Fe Kα) are a result of 
the particle mass effect reducing all X-ray intensities com-
pared to bulk behavior. Clearly, these raw concentrations 
</p>
<p>have such large systematic errors as to offer no realistic 
meaning. To compensate for the mass effect and thus place 
the concentrations on a meaningful basis, internal normal-
ization can be applied:
</p>
<p>C C C
n i i i( )
</p>
<p>= / Σ
 
</p>
<p>(23.3)
</p>
<p>Note that normalization is only useful if all constituents pres-
ent in the analyzed volume are included in the total, includ-
ing any such as oxygen that are calculated by assumed 
stoichiometry rather than measured directly. After normal-
ization, the relative errors are reduced in magnitude, as given 
in . Table&nbsp;23.4, but the values for Mg (&minus;14 %) and Fe (+26 %) 
remain well outside the bulk analysis error histogram.
</p>
<p>. Table&nbsp;23.5 presents similar measurements and calcula-
tions for a 6.1-μm-diameter K411 particle for which the ana-
lytical total is 1.091. This particle diameter is sufficiently large 
so that the X-ray production for the higher energy photons, 
Ca K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 and Fe K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
, has nearly reached equivalence to the 
</p>
<p>flat, bulk target, resulting in relative errors of &minus;5 % or less. 
For this particle size, the lower energy photon peaks, Mg 
K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 and Si K-L
</p>

</p>
<p>is the case for a flat, bulk target. When these raw concentra-
tions are normalized, the relative errors for Mg and Si are 
reduced, but the relative errors for Ca and Fe are increased 
after normalization.
</p>
<p>These examples demonstrate the complex interplay of 
X-ray generation and propagation as influenced by particle 
geometry. While normalization of the raw calculated concen-
trations is necessary to put particle analyses on a realistic 
concentration basis, the uncertainty budget for particle anal-
ysis is substantially increased compared to that for the ideal 
flat target. . Figure&nbsp;23.33 plots the relative error envelope for 
normalized concentrations as a function of particle diameter 
for spherical particles of K411 glass. For particles whose 
dimensions are substantially smaller than the bulk interac-
tion volume, the relative errors in the normalized concentra-
tions are large and increase as the particle size decreases. The 
relative errors decrease as the particle diameter increases, 
eventually converging with the flat bulk case for particles 
above approximately 25-μm diameter.
</p>
<p>Normalization is most successful when applied to compo-
sitions where the measured characteristic X-rays have similar 
energies, for example, Mg K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
, Al K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 and Si K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
. 
</p>
<p>Although low atomic number elements such as oxygen can be 
measured directly, the high absorption of the low energy pho-
tons of the characteristic X-ray significantly increases the 
effect of the particle absorption effect, so that normalization 
introduces large errors and effectively transfers increased

<p>error to the other higher atomic number constituents. In the 
case of oxygen, the method of assumed stoichiometry is gen-
erally much more effective.
</p>
<p> Does Overscanning Help?
</p>
<p>Because of the difficulty in analyzing particles, overscan-
ning the particle during EDS collection is thought to obtain 
a spectrum that averages particle effects. In reality, even for 
homogeneous particles, overscanning does not decrease 
the relative uncertainties but can actually cause an increase. 
. Figure&nbsp; 23.34a plots the relative errors in the normalized 
concentrations for the analysis of Mg and Fe in K411 spheres 
of various sizes, comparing point beam analyses centered on 
the particle image with continuous overscanning during EDS 
collection. Mg and Fe are chosen because the large separa-
tion in characteristic X-ray energy provides sensitivity to 
the action of the particle mass effect, which is the only sig-
nificant influence on energetic Fe K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
, while both the mass 
</p>
<p>effect and the absorption effect influence Mg K-L
2,3
</p>
<p>. While 
the error range for point beam analysis is substantially larger 
than the ideal error histogram for flat bulk target analysis, the 
effect of overscanning is actually to shift the distribution of 
results to even more severe relative errors. This is a result of 
the non-linear nature of X-ray absorption, which can be seen 
in the beam placement measurements shown in . Figs.&nbsp;23.24 
and 23.25. A similar effect is seen for irregular shards in 
. Fig.&nbsp;23.34b.

<p>23.6.6 Peak-to-Background (P/B) Method
</p>
<p>Specimen Geometry Severely Affects the 
k-ratio, but Not the P/B
</p>
<p>Another approach to establishing quantitative X-ray micro-
analysis for objects of an irregular shape, such as particles 
and rough surfaces, is the peak-to-background (P/B) method, 
which is an extension of the Marshall&ndash;Hall method for the 
correction of mass loss in beam-sensitive materials (see 
7 Chap. 20) (Marshall and Hall, 1966; Hall, 1968). The P/B 
method (Small et al., 1978, 1979a,b; Statham and Pawley, 
1978; Statham, 1979; Wendt and Schmidt, 1978; August and 
</p>
<p>Wernisch, 1991a, b, c) is based on the observation that 
although the characteristic X-ray intensity emitted from an 
irregularly shaped object is highly dependent on local geo-
metric effects, the P/B ratio measured between the character-
istic X-rays and the continuum X-rays of the same energy is 
much less sensitive to specimen geometry. . Table 23.6 con-
tains measurements of the k-ratio (measured relative to bulk 
K411) and the P/B from the spectra of the SRM-470 (K-411 
glass) shards in Fig. 23.13. The shard spectra show significant 
deviations from the spectrum of the polished bulk K411, 
especially at low photon energies below 4&nbsp;keV. Although the 
k-ratio for Mg measured for these shards varies by a factor of

<p>2.95 for the most extreme case, the corresponding P/B ratio 
for Mg only differs from that of the bulk K411 by a factor of 
1.03. For the particular combination of elements in K-411 at 
this beam energy (20&nbsp;keV), the most extreme variation in the 
P/B observed for these shards is 1.13 for Ca.
</p>
<p>Although the characteristic and continuum X-rays are pro-
duced by different physical processes (inner shell ionization 
versus deceleration in a Coulombic field) that have different 
behaviors as a function of the exciting electron energy; espe-
cially near the ionization threshold for an element, both char-
acteristic and continuum X-rays are generated in nearly the 
same volume. Both forms of radiation thus scale similar to the 
geometric mass effect, because the loss of beam electrons due 
to backscattering and penetration also robs both characteristic 
</p>
<p>and continuum generation processes, at least to a first order for 
photons of the same energy. Both types of radiation have a 
similar, although not identical, depth distribution; thus, the 
absorption paths to the detector are alike. As the same photon 
energy is chosen for characteristic and continuum X-rays, the 
geometric absorption effect is thus comparable for both. When 
making corrections for an irregularly shaped object, the exact 
absorption path is very difficult to determine. Because the con-
tinuum radiation of the same photon energy is following the 
same path to the detector that the characteristic radiation fol-
lows, regardless of local object shape, this continuum intensity 
I
</p>
<p>B
 can be used as an automatic internal normalization factor to 
</p>
<p>compensate for the major geometric effects. Furthermore, the 
P/B ratio is independent of probe current (and thus need not 
be measured); yet, the quantification results need not be nor-
malized. Because of this, both standards-based and standard-
less P/B algorithms have been implemented that provide an 
estimate of the analytical total. More sophisticated models 
have been developed that account for the second-order (i.e., 
subtler) differences between the distributions of characteristic 
and continuum radiation generation (August and Wernisch, 
1991a, b, c).

</p>
<p>I is the characteristic peak intensity corrected for continuum

<p>object
 
</p>
<p>is a strong function of the object&rsquo;s size and shape, but the ratio

) involving the background at the

<p>same photon energy is nearly independent of object size, 
except for very small particles where the anisotropy of the 
continuum emission becomes significant (Small et al., 1980). 
This experimental observation, which has been confirmed by 
theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, can be 
employed in several ways (Small et al., 1978; Statham, and 
Pawley, 1978). One useful approach is to incorporate the fol-
lowing correction scheme into a conventional ZAF method 
(Small et al., 1978, 1979b). Given that:

<p>standard identical in composition to the unknown object is

</p>
<p>(23.6)
</p>
<p>where I
j,B,std
</p>
<p> is the pure element bremsstrahlung at the energy 
of interest and C
</p>
<p>j
 is the concentration of element j. An exam-
</p>
<p>ple of an analysis of a complex IN-100 particle with conven-
tional k-ratio/matrix corrections (including normalization of 
the raw values) and using the k-ratio/matrix corrections aug-
mented with the P/B method is given in . Table 23.7. The 
relative deviation from the expected value (RDEV) for each 
element is reduced compared with the simple normalization 
procedure, especially for Al, which is highly absorbed when 
measured on the backside of the particle.
</p>
<p>The special advantage of the P/B method is that it can be 
applied to spectra obtained with a focused probe directed at 
a specific location on a particle. Thus, particles that have a 
chemically heterogeneous sub-structure can be directly stud-
ied. To be effective, the P/B method requires spectra with 
high counts. Because the ratio of background intensities is 
used to scale the particle peak intensities, the statistical 
uncertainty in the background ratio propagates into the error 
in each concentration value in addition to the statistics of the 
characteristic peak. Even more importantly, the P/B method 
depends on the background radiation originating in the 
excited volume of the specimen only, and not in the sur-
rounding substrate. When an irregularly shaped object such 
as a particle becomes small relative to the bulk interaction 
volume, the penetration of the beam into the substrate means 
that the continuum continues to be produced, even if the 
substrate is a low atomic number element such as carbon. As 
noted above, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy 
</p>
<p>collimator has a large acceptance area at the specimen. To 
minimize the extraneous background contributions, the 
small particles should be mounted on a thin (approximately 
10&ndash;20&nbsp;nm) carbon film supported on a metal grid (typically 
copper, as used in the transmission electron microscope) and 
mounted over a blind hole drilled into a carbon block. The 
continuum contribution from such a thin film is negligible 
relative to particles as small as approximately 250&nbsp; nm in 
diameter.
</p>
<p>23.7  Summary
</p>
<p> 1. Particle analysis is inevitably compromised compared to 
analysis of ideal flat samples, leading to an increased 
error budget.
</p>
<p> 2. Careful attention must be paid to optimizing particle 
sample preparation to minimize substrate contributions 
to the spectrum and to reduce contributions from 
nearby particles.
</p>
<p> 3. Quantitative analysis of particles follows the k-ratio/
matrix correction protocol. The analytical total that 
results from this procedure is an indication of the 
magnitude of particle geometry effects (mass effect and 
absorption effect).
</p>
<p> 4. Normalization of the raw concentrations (including 
oxygen by stoichiometry, if appropriate) is necessary 
to place the calculated composition on a realistic 
basis.
</p>
<p> 5. Large relative errors, exceeding 10%, are encountered after 
normalization. The analytical errors are exacerbated when 
low and high photon peaks must be used for analysis.
</p>
<p> 6. The analytical errors generally increase as the particle 
size decreases.
</p>
<p> 7. Overscanning does not decrease the analytical errors, 
and may well increase the errors depending on the 
particular combination of elements being analyzed.

<p>SEM images that show the spatial distribution of the elemen-
tal constituents of a specimen (&ldquo;elemental maps&rdquo;) can be cre-
ated by using the characteristic X-ray intensity measured for 
each element with the energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer 
(EDS) to define the gray level (or color value) at each picture 
element (pixel) of the scan. Elemental maps based on X-ray 
intensity provide qualitative information on spatial distribu-
tions of elements. Compositional mapping, in which a full 
EDS spectrum is recorded at each pixel (&ldquo;X-ray Spectrum 
Imaging&rdquo; or XSI) and processed with peak fitting, k-ratio 
standardization, and matrix corrections, provides a quantita-
tive basis for comparing maps of different elements in the 
same region, or for the same element from different regions.

<p>24.1  Total Intensity Region-of-Interest 
Mapping
</p>
<p>In the simplest implementation of elemental mapping, 
energy regions are defined in the spectrum that span the 
characteristic X-ray peak(s) of interest, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 24.1. The total X-ray intensity (counts) within each 
energy region, I
</p>
<p>Xi
, consisting of both the characteristic peak 
</p>
<p>intensity, including any overlapping peaks, and the contin-
uum background intensity, is digitally recorded for each 
pixel, creating a set of x-y-I
</p>
<p>Xi
 image arrays for the defined 
</p>
<p>suite of elements. Depending on the local concentration of

<p>c
 for the measured 
</p>
<p>characteristic peak, the beam current, the solid angle of the 
detector, and the dwell time per pixel, the number of counts 
</p>
<p>per elemental window can vary widely from a few counts 
per pixel to several thousand or more. A typical strategy to 
avoid saturation is to collect 2-byte deep X-ray intensity 
data that permits up to 65,536 counts per energy region per 
pixel. In common with the practice for BSE and SE images, 
the final elemental map will be displayed with a 1-byte 
intensity range (0&ndash;255 gray levels). To maximize the con-
trast within each map it is necessary to nearly fill this dis-
play range so that it is common practice to automatically 
scale (&ldquo;autoscale&rdquo;) the measured intensity in a linear fashion 
to span slightly less than 1-byte. The displayed gray levels 
are scaled to range from near black, but avoiding black (gray 
level zero) to avoid clipping, to near white, but avoiding full 
white (gray level 255), to prevent saturation. The counts are 
expanded for elements that span less than 1-byte in the 
original data collection, while the counts are compressed for 
elements that extend into the 2-byte range. An example of 
such total intensity mapping is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.2, which 
presents a set of maps for Si, Fe, and Mn in a cross section of 
a deep-sea manganese nodule with a complex microstruc-
ture. The EDS spectrum shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.1 also reveals a 
typical problem encountered in simple intensity window 
mapping. Manganese is one of the most abundant elements 
in this specimen, and the Mn K-M

 (6.490&nbsp;keV) interferes 
</p>
<p>with Fe K-L
2,3
</p>
<p> (6.400&nbsp; keV), which is especially significant 
since iron is a minor/trace constituent. To avoid the poten-
tial artifacts in this situation, the analyst can instead choose 
the Fe K-M
</p>
<p>2,3
 (7.057&nbsp;keV) which does not suffer the inter-
</p>
<p>ference but which is approximately a factor of ten lower 
intensity than Fe K-L

<p>success of this strategy is revealed in . Fig.&nbsp;24.2, where the 
major Mn and minor Fe are seen to be anti-correlated.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp; 24.2 also contains a primary color overlay of 
these three elements, encoded with Si in red, Fe in green, and 
Mn in blue, a commonly used image display tool which pro-
vides an immediate visual comparison of the relative spatial 
relationships of the three constituents. The appearance of 
secondary colors shows areas of coincidence of any two ele-
ments, for example, the cyan colored region is a combination 
of green and blue and thus shows the coincidence of Fe and 
Mn. The other possible binary combinations are yellow (red 
plus green, Si + Fe) and magenta (red plus blue, Si + Mn), 
which are not present in this example. If all three elements 
were present at the same location, white would result.
</p>
<p>24.1.1  Limitations of&nbsp;Total Intensity 
Mapping
</p>
<p>While total intensity elemental maps such as those in 
. Fig.&nbsp;24.2 are useful for developing a basic understanding of 
the spatial distributions of the elements that make up the 
specimen, total intensity mapping is subject to several sig-
nificant limitations:
 1. By selecting only the spectral regions-of-interest, the 
</p>
<p>amount of mass storage is minimized. However, while&nbsp;all 
spectral regions-of-interest are collected simultaneously, 
if the analyst needs to evaluate another element not ori-
ginally selected when the data&nbsp;was collected, the entire 
image scan must be repeated to recollect the data with that 
new element included.

</p>
<p> 2. Total intensity maps convey qualitative information only. 
The elemental spatial distributions are meaningful only 
in qualitative terms of interpreting which elements are 
present at a particular pixel location(s) by comparing dif-
ferent elemental maps of the same area, for example, using 
the color overlay method. Since the images are recorded 
simultaneously, the pixel registration is without error even 
if overall drift or other distortion occurs. However, the 
intensity information is not quantitative and can only con-
vey relative abundance information within an individual 
elemental map (e.g., &ldquo;this location has more of element A 
than this location because the intensity of A is higher&rdquo;). 
The gray levels in maps for different elements cannot be 
readily compared because the X-ray intensity for each 
element that defines the gray level range of the map is 
determined by the local concentration and the complex 
physics of X-ray generation, propagation, and detection 
efficiency, all of which vary with the elemental species. 
The element-to-element differences in the efficiency of 
X-ray production, propagation, and detection are embed-
ded in the raw measured X-ray intensities, which are 
then subjected to the autoscaling operation. Unless the 
autoscaling factor is recorded (typically not), it is not pos-
sible after the fact to recover the information that would 
enable the analyst to standardize and establish a proper 
basis for inter-comparison of maps of different elements, 
or even of maps of the same element from different areas. 
Thus, the sequence of gray levels only has interpretable 
meaning within an individual elemental map. Gray levels 
cannot be sensibly compared between total intensity maps 
of different elements, for example, the near-white level in 
the autoscaled maps of . Fig.&nbsp;24.2 for Si, Fe, and Mn does 
not correspond to the same X-ray intensity or concentra-
tion for three elements. Because of autoscaling, it is not 
possible to compare maps for the same element &ldquo;A&rdquo; from 
two different regions, even if recorded with the same dose 
conditions, since the autoscaling factor will be controlled 
by the maximum concentration of &ldquo;A,&rdquo; which may not be 
the same in two arbitrarily chosen regions of the sample.
</p>
<p> 3. This lack of quantitative information in elemental total 
intensity maps extends to the color overlay presentation 
of elemental maps seen in . Fig.&nbsp;24.2. The color over-
lay&nbsp;is useful to compare the spatial relationships among 
the&nbsp;three elements, but the specific color observed 
at any pixel only depicts elemental coincidence not 
absolute or relative concentration. The particular color 
that occurs&nbsp;at a given pixel depends on the complex 
physics&nbsp;of X-ray generation, propagation, and detec-
tion as well as concentration, and the autoscaling of the 
separate maps that precedes the color overlay, which 
distorts the apparent relationships among the elemental 
constituents, also influences the observed colors.
</p>
<p> 4. When peak interference occurs, the raw intensity&nbsp;in 
a given energy window may contain contribu-
tions from another element, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.1 
where&nbsp;the region that includes Fe K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 also con-
</p>
<p>tains intensity from Mn K-M
2,3
</p>
<p>. While choosing the 
non-interfered&nbsp;peak Fe K-M
</p>
<p>2,3
 gives a useful result 
</p>
<p>in the case of the manganese nodule, if the speci-
men also contained cobalt at a significant level, Co 
K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 (6.930&nbsp;keV) would interfere with Fe K-M
</p>
<p>2,3
 
</p>
<p>(7.057&nbsp;keV) and invalidate this strategy. The peak 
interference artifact can be corrected by peak fitting, 
or by methods in which the measured Mn K-L
</p>
<p>2,3
 
</p>
<p>intensity, which does not suffer interference in this 
particular case, is used to correct the intensity of the 
Fe K-L
</p>

 window using the known Mn 
</p>
<p>K-M
2,3
</p>
<p>/K-L
2,3
</p>
<p> ratio.
 5. The total intensity window contains both the charac-
</p>
<p>teristic peak intensity that is specific to an element 
and the continuum (background) intensity, which 
scales with the average atomic number of all of the 
elements within the excited interaction volume but is 
not exclusively related to the element that is generat-
ing the peak. For the map of an element that consti-
tutes a major constituent (mass concentration C &gt;0.1 
or 10&nbsp;wt %), the non-specific background intensity 
contribution usually does not constitute a serious 
mapping artifact. However, for a minor constituent 
(0.01 &le; C &le; 0.1, 1&nbsp;wt % to 10&nbsp;wt %), the average atomic 
number dependence of the continuum background 
can lead to serious artifacts. . Figure&nbsp;24.3 shows an 
example of this phenomenon for a Raney nickel alloy 
containing major Al and Ni with minor Fe. The 
complex microstructure has four distinct phases, the 
compositions of which are listed in . Table&nbsp;24.1, one 
of which contains Fe as a minor constituent at a 
concentration of approximately C = 0.04 (4&nbsp;wt %). 
This Fe-rich phase can be readily discerned in the Fe 
gray-scale map, where the intensity of this phase, 
being the highest iron-containing region in the 
image, has been autoscaled to near white. In addition 
to this Fe-containing phase, there appears to be 
segregation of lower concentration levels of Fe to the 
Ni-rich phase relative to the Al-rich phase. However, 
this effect is at least partially due to the increase in 
the continuum background in the Ni-rich region 
relative to the Al-rich region because of the sharp 
difference in the average atomic number. For trace 
constituents (C &lt; 0.01, 1&nbsp;wt %), the atomic number 
dependence of the continuum background can 
dominate the observed contrast, creating artifacts in 
the images that render most trace constituent maps 
nearly useless.

<p>24.2  X-Ray Spectrum Imaging
</p>
<p>X-ray spectrum imaging (XSI) involves collecting the entire 
EDS spectrum, I(E), at each pixel location, producing a large 
data structure [x, y, I(E)] typically referred to as a &ldquo;datacube&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Gorlen et&nbsp;al. 1984; Newbury and Ritchie, 2013). Alternatively, 
the data may be recorded as &ldquo;position-tagged&rdquo; photons, whereby 
as each photon with energy E
</p>
<p>p
 is detected, it is tagged with the 
</p>
<p>current beam location (x, y), giving a database of values (x, y, E
p
) 
</p>
<p>which can be subsequently sampled with rules defining the 
range of Δx and Δy over which to construct a spectrum I(E) at 
a single pixel or over a defined range of pixels. Depending on the 
number of pixels and the intensity range of the X-ray count data, 
the recorded XSI can be very large, ranging from hundreds of 
megabytes to several gigabytes. Vendor software usually com-
presses the datacube to save mass storage space, but the result-
ing compressed datacube can only be decompressed and viewed 
with the vendor&rsquo;s proprietary software. As an important alterna-
tive, if the datacube can be saved in the uncompressed RAW 
format (a simple block of bytes with a header or an associated 
file that carries the metadata needed to read the file), the RAW 
file can be read by publically available, open source software 
such as NIH ImageJ-Fiji or NIST Lispix (Bright, 2017).

</p>
<p>Regardless of how the measured photons are cataloged, 
the XSI captures all possible elemental information about the 
region of the specimen being mapped within the limitations 
set by the excitation energy (E
</p>
<p>0
), the dose (beam current 
</p>
<p>multiplied by pixel dwell time, i
B
 * τ), and the EDS spectrom-
</p>
<p>eter performance (solid angle and efficiency). . Figure&nbsp;24.4 
shows the conceptual nature of the data. The [x, y, I(E)] data-
cube can be thought of as an x-y array of spectra I(E). The 
individual pixel spectra can be selected by the analyst for 
inspection by specifying the x-y location. Depending on the 
electron beam current, the pixel dwell time, and the solid 
angle of the EDS detector, the counts in an individual pixel 
spectrum may be low. For the example XSI of Raney nickel 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.4, the upper spectrum taken from an Ni- 
rich area has a maximum of 40 counts per energy channel, 
</p>
<p>while the lower spectrum from a different pixel in an Al-rich 
region has a maximum of 150 counts. An alternative view of 
the datacube is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.5, where the datacube can 
be thought of as a stack or deck of x-y image cards, where 
each x-y image corresponds to a different energy with an 
energy range (&ldquo;card thickness&rdquo;) equal to the energy channel 
width, for example, typically 5&nbsp; eV or 10&nbsp; eV.&nbsp; If a card is 
selected from the stack with an energy that corresponds to a 
characteristic peak, then the card shows the elemental map 
for that peak, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.5. A card with an energy 
that corresponds to spectral background will have fewer 
counts than a peak card, but such a background card may 
still have discernible microstructural information because of 
the atomic number dependence of the X-ray continuum, as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.5.

<p>24.2.1  Utilizing XSI Datacubes
</p>
<p>In the simplest case, by capturing all possible X-ray informa-
tion about an imaged region, the XSI permits the analyst to 
define regions-of-interest for total intensity mapping at any 
time after collecting the map datacube, creating elemental 
maps such as those in . Fig.&nbsp;24.2. If additional information is 
required about other elements not in the initial set-up, there 
is no need to relocate the specimen area and repeat the map 
since the full spectrum has been captured in the XSI.
</p>
<p>The challenge to the analyst is to make efficient use of the 
XSI datacube by discovering (&ldquo;mining&rdquo;) the useful informa-
tion that it contains. Software for aiding the analyst in the 
interpretation of XSI datacubes ranges from simple tools in 
open source software to highly sophisticated, proprietary 
vendor software that utilizes statistical comparisons to auto-
matically recognize spatial correlations among elements 
present in the specimen region that was mapped (Kotula 
et&nbsp;al. 2003).
</p>
<p>24.2.2  Derived Spectra
</p>
<p> SUM Spectrum
</p>
<p>Simple but highly effective software tools that are present in 
nearly all vendor XSI platforms as well as the open source soft-
ware (NIH ImageJ-Fiji and NIST Lispix) include those that 
calculate &ldquo;derived spectra.&rdquo; Derived spectra are constructed by 
systematically applying an algorithm to the datacube to 
extract carefully defined information. The most basic derived 
spectrum is the &ldquo;SUM&rdquo; spectrum, illustrated schematically in 
. Fig.&nbsp;24.6. Conceptually, each energy &ldquo;card&rdquo; in the XSI data-
cube is selected and the counts in all pixels on that card are 
added together, as indicated by the systematic route through 
all pixels shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 24.6. This summed count value is 
then placed in the corresponding energy bin of the SUM spec-
trum under construction, and the process is then repeated for 
the next energy card until all energies have been considered. 
The resulting SUM spectrum has the familiar features of a 
conventional spectrum: characteristic X-ray peaks and the

<p>X-ray continuum background, as well as artifacts such as 
coincidence peaks and Si-escape peaks. The SUM spectrum in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 24.6 was calculated from the same Raney nickel XSI 
datacube used for . Fig.&nbsp; 24.4. Note that the count axis now 
extends to more than 3 million counts, much higher than the 
count axes of the individual pixel spectra in . Fig.&nbsp;24.4 because 
of the large number of pixels that have been added together to 
construct the SUM spectrum. The characteristic peaks that 
can be recognized in the SUM spectrum (scaled to the highest 
intensity) represent the dominant, most abundant elemental 
features contained in the XSI.&nbsp;The analyst can select a peak 
</p>
<p>channel and view the corresponding energy card to reveal the 
elemental map for that peak, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.7. By select-
ing a band of adjacent channels that spans the peak and aver-
aging the counts for each x-y pixel in the set of energy cards, 
an elemental image with reduced noise is obtained, as also 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 24.7. Systematically selecting each of the 
prominent characteristic X-ray peaks, total intensity maps for 
all of the major elemental constituents can be obtained. The 
SUM spectrum can be treated just like a normally recorded 
spectrum. By expanding the vertical scale or changing from a

<p>peaks corresponding to minor and trace constituents can be 
recognized, and the corresponding total-intensity region-of-
interest images can be constructed, subject to the increas-
ing&nbsp;influence of the continuum background incorporated in 
the window. For these lower abundance constituents, it is 
 necessary to use a band of energy channels to reduce the noise 
in the resulting elemental image, and such images are sub-
ject&nbsp;to the artifacts that arise from the atomic number depen-
dence of the X-ray continuum noted above.
</p>
<p> MAXIMUM PIXEL Spectrum
</p>
<p>The SUM spectrum reveals dominant elemental features in the 
mapped region. Rare, unexpected elemental features, which in 
the extreme case may occur at only a single pixel (i.e., looking 
for a &ldquo;needle-in-a-haystack&rdquo; when you don&rsquo;t even know that it 
</p>
<p>is a needle you are looking for!) can be recognized with the 
&ldquo;MAXIMUM PIXEL&rdquo; derived spectrum (Bright and Newbury 
2004). As shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.8, the MAXIMUM PIXEL derived 
spectrum is calculated by making the same tour through all of

trum, but rather than adding the pixel contents, the algorithm 
now locates the maximum intensity within a card regardless of 
what pixel it comes from to represent that energy value in the 
constructed MAXIMUM PIXEL spectrum. An example of the 
application of the MAXIMUM PIXEL spectrum to an XSI is 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.9, where an unanticipated Cr peak is recog-
nized. When the Cr image is selected from the XSI, the Cr is

</p>
<p>After the elemental maps have been created from the 
XSI, additional image processing tools can be brought to 
bear. Spatial regions-of-interest can be defined in the ele-
mental maps or in corresponding BSE or SE images 
recorded simultaneously with the XSI.&nbsp;These spatial regions 
can be selected by simple image processing tools that define 
a group of contiguous pixels that fall within a particular 
shape (square, rectangle, circle, ellipsoid, or closed free 
</p>
<p>form are typical choices). Another approach is the creation 
of a pixel mask by selecting all pixels within a particular 
elemental map (or BSE or SE image) whose intensities fall 
within a defined range above a specified gray level thresh-
old. Pixels that satisfy this intensity criterion can occur any-
where in the x&ndash;y plane of the XSI and do not have to be 
contiguous. Selections can range down to an individual 
pixel. An example of this process is shown in . Figure 24.10, 
where the Fe-rich phase has been selected from the Fe total 
intensity map (shown in color overlay with Al and Ni) to 
create a mask (shown as a binary image in the inset) from 
which the SUM spectrum representing the Fe-rich phase is 
constructed.

<p>24.3  Quantitative Compositional Mapping
</p>
<p>The XSI contains the complete EDS spectrum at each pixel (or 
the position-tagged photon database that can be used to 
reconstruct the individual pixel spectra). Quantitative com-
positional mapping implements the normal fixed measure-
ment location quantitative analysis procedure at every pixel in 
a map. Qualitative analysis is first performed to identify the 
peaks in the SUM and MAXIMUM PIXEL spectra of the XSI 
to determine the suite of elements present within the mapped 
area, noting that all elements are unlikely to be present at 
every pixel. The pixel-level EDS spectra can then be individu-
ally processed following the same quantitative analysis proto-
col used for individually measured spectra, ultimately 
replacing the gray or color scale in total intensity elemental 
maps, which are based on raw X-ray intensities and which are 
nearly impossible to compare, with a gray or color scale based 
on the calculated concentrations, which can be sensibly com-
pared. Most vendor compositional mapping software extracts 
characteristic peak intensities by applying multiple linear 
least squares (MLLS) peak fitting or alternatively fits a back-
ground model under the peaks. These extracted pixel-level 
</p>
<p>elemental intensities are then quantified by a &ldquo;standardless 
analysis&rdquo; procedure to calculate the individual pixel concen-
tration values. Alternatively, rigorous standards-based quan-
titative analysis can be performed on the pixel-level intensity 
data with NIST DTSA II by utilizing the scripting language to 
sequentially calculate the pixel spectra in a datacube. MLLS 
peak fitting to extract the characteristic intensities, k-ratio 
calculation relative to a library of measured standards, and 
matrix corrections to yield the local concentrations of these 
elements for each pixel. An example of the NIST DTSA-II 
procedure applied to an XSI measured on the manganese 
nodule example of . Fig.&nbsp; 24.2 is presented in . Fig.&nbsp; 24.11, 
where the Fe K-L

<p>, shows a change in the 
apparent level of Fe in the center of the image after quantita-
tive correction, as well as changes in several finer-scale details.
</p>
<p>Quantitative compositional maps for major constituents 
displayed as gray-scale images are virtually identical to raw 
intensity elemental maps, as shown for the major constitu-
ents Al and Ni in . Figs.&nbsp;24.12 and 24.13. Significant differ-
ences between raw intensity maps and compositional maps 
are found for minor and trace constituents, where correction

<p>for the continuum background significantly changes the 
gray-scale image. As shown for the minor Fe constituent in 
. Figs.&nbsp;24.12 and 24.13, the false Fe contrast between the Ni- 
rich and Al-rich phases that arises due to the atomic number 
dependence of the X-ray continuum is eliminated in the Fe 
compositional map.
</p>
<p>While rendering the underlying pixel data of quantita-
tive compositional maps in gray scale is a useful starting 
point, the problem of achieving a quantitatively meaningful 
display remains. Because of autoscaling, the gray scales of 
the Al, Ni, and Fe maps in . Fig.&nbsp;24.12 do not have the same 
numerical meaning. The Al and Ni concentrations locally 
reach high enough levels to correspond to brighter gray 
levels and have sufficient range to create strong contrast 
with direct gray-scale encoding, as seen in . Figs.&nbsp;24.12 and 
24.13. The Fe  constituent which is present at a concentra-
tion with a maximum of approximately 0.04 mass fraction 
(4&nbsp;wt %) never exceeds the minor constituent range, so the 
Fe map appears dark with little contrast in the quantita-
tive&nbsp; map of . Fig.&nbsp; 24.13. Autoscaling of the Fe-map in 
. Fig.&nbsp;24.14 improves the contrast, but the same limitations 
</p>
<p>of autoscaling noted above still apply. Various pseudo-color 
scales, in which bands of contrasting colors are applied to 
the underlying data, are typically available in image pro-
cessing software. Such pseudo-color scale can partially 
overcome the display limitations of gray-scale presentation, 
but the resulting images are often difficult to interpret. An 
example of a five band pseudo-color scale applied to the 
compositional maps using NIST Lispix is shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 24.15. An effective display scheme for quantitative 
elemental maps that enables a viewer to readily compare 
concentrations of different elements spanning major, minor 
and trace ranges can be achieved with the Logarithmic 
Three-Band Encoding (Newbury and Bright 1999). A band 
of colors is assigned to each decade of the concentration 
range with the following characteristics:
</p>
<p>Major: C &gt; 0.1 to 1 (mass fraction) deep red to red pastel
Minor: 0.01 &le; C &le; 0.1 deep green to green pastel
Trace: 0.001 &le; C &lt; 0.01 deep blue to blue pastel

<p>from the atomic-number dependence of the X-ray continuum 
seen in the raw Fe intensity image, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.17. 
The Logarithmic Three-Band Encoding shows that this appar-
ent contrast occurs near the lower limit of the trace range. Is 
this trace Fe contrast meaningful or merely an uncorrected

<p>artifact? To examine this question, the analyst can use pixel 
masks of each phase selected from the Ni compositional map 
(or the BSE image) to obtain the SUM spectrum, as shown in 
. Figs.&nbsp; 24.18 (Fe-rich phase), 24.19 (Al-rich phase), 24.20 
(Ni-intermediate phase), and 24.21 (Ni-rich phase). These 
SUM spectra confirm that Fe is indeed present as a trace

where C

<p>Fe
 = 0.0027 (2700&nbsp; ppm), falling to C

<p>Fe
 = 0.00038 
</p>
<p>(380&nbsp; ppm) in the high-Ni phase and to C
Fe
</p>
<p> = 0.00030 
(300&nbsp;ppm) in the high-Al phase. Additionally, trace Cr at a 
similar concentration is found in the Al-rich phase along with 
the trace Fe.

<p>24.4  Strategy for&nbsp;XSI Elemental Mapping 
Data Collection
</p>
<p>24.4.1  Choosing the&nbsp;EDS Dead-Time
</p>
<p>The analyst has a choice of time constants in the EDS soft-
ware, a parameter variously known as shaping time, process-
ing time, etc., and typically expressed as time value (e.g., 
200&nbsp;ns, 400&nbsp;ns, 1&nbsp;μs), as a count rate value (e.g., the through-
put at the peak of the input&ndash;output response), or as a simple 
integer. The shorter the time constant, the higher the peak 
throughput, expressed as the output count rate (OCR) versus 
the input count rate (ICR), but the poorer the resolution. The 
performance of a silicon drift detector (SDD)-EDS with three 
time constant choices is illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;24.22, where the 
</p>
<p>peak of the OCR vs. ICR plot varies dramatically with the 
time  constant selected. All forms of EDS microanalysis are 
improved by increasing the number of X-ray counts mea-
sured, but elemental mapping is especially dependent on 
accumulating large numbers of X-rays since mapping divides 
the total count among a large number of pixels. To obtain 
adequate counts per pixel for meaningful analytical 
 information at the  individual pixel level, it is common prac-
tice to accept the resolution penalty to operate on the highest 
throughput curve in . Fig.&nbsp;24.22. Of course, to produce the

</p>
<p> acceptable dead-time will depend on the level of spectral arti-
facts that the analyst is willing to accept: (1) If the mapping 
 software collects the XSI at constant pixel dwell time without 
dead-time correction, the resulting map can be subject to 
severe artifacts if the dead-time is so high that the peak of the 
OCR versus ICR response is exceeded at some pixels during 
mapping. As shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 24.23, operating at very high 
dead-time can result in the same OCR being produced by two 
widely different ICR values, which may effectively correspond 
to two different concentrations. Artifacts produced by this 
effect are shown in the Al elemental maps recorded at high 
dead-time shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 24.24. Dead-time-corrected data 
collection in elemental mapping avoids this artifact. (2) If the 
analyst is interested in minor and/or trace level constituents, 
</p>
<p>coincidence artifacts, which scale with dead-time, must be 
considered. Coincidence peaks for Al + NiL and Al + Al, as 
well as the coincidence continuum between these peaks, are 
illustrated in . Figs.&nbsp;24.18, 24.19, 24.20, and 24.21. This por-
tion of the EDS spectrum contains K-shell peaks for S and Cl, 
L-shell peaks for Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag, and M-shell 
peaks for Hg, Tl, Pb, and Bi. If none of these elements is of 
interest at the minor or trace level, then the Al + NiL and 
Al + Al coincidence can be ignored and the advantages of 
high throughput realized for the other elements of interest. 
However, if this spectral region is required for one or more of 
these elements, a lower dead-time should be selected by 
reducing the beam current to reduce coincidence, which 
depends strongly on the input count rate.

<p>24.4.2  Choosing the&nbsp;Pixel Density
</p>
<p>The size of the scanned area, the number of image pixels (n
X
, 
</p>
<p>n
Y
) and the pixel dwell time, τ, are critical parameters that 
</p>
<p>the analyst must choose when defining an XSI data collec-
tion. An estimate of the size of the lateral extent of the X-ray 
interaction volume, obtained either from the Kanaya&ndash;
Okayama X-ray range or from Monte Carlo simulation, is 
also useful, especially for small-area, high-magnification 
mapping. Choosing the size of the scanned area (magnifica-
tion) depends on the lateral extent of the specimen features 
that are the objective of the mapping measurement. As is the 
case with SEM imaging using BSEs and/or SEs, when large 
areas are being scanned (low magnification operation), the 
pixel size may be greater than the lateral extent of the X-ray 
source size, which is a convolution of the incident beam size 
and the interaction volume for X-ray production, so that 
much of the pixel area is effectively unsampled. In principle, 
</p>
<p>the empty area of the pixel could be &ldquo;filled in&rdquo; by increasing 
the number of pixels to reduce the pixel size, but this would 
lead to extremely large XSI data structures that would require 
very long accumulation times. A practical upper limit for 
XSI mapping is typically 1024 &times; 1024 pixels, which for a 
spectrum of 4096 channels of 2 bytes intensity depth would 
produce an XSI of 8 Gbytes in the uncompressed RAW for-
mat. To reduce the mass storage as well as the subsequent 
processing time for quantitative compositional mapping cal-
culations, the analyst may choose 512 &times; 512 or 256 &times; 256 
pixel scan fields, especially when a small area is scanned 
(high magnification operation) leading to overlapping pix-
els. A pixel overlap of approximately 25 % serves to fill all 
space in the square pixels, but further oversampling provides 
no additional information, so that the analyst would be bet-
ter served by lowering the magnification to cover more 
specimen area with the chosen pixel density, or alternatively, 
choose a lower pixel density.

<p>24.4.3  Choosing the&nbsp;Pixel Dwell Time
</p>
<p>Once the analyst has chosen the pixel density, the product of 
the number of pixels in a map and the pixel dwell time gives 
the total mapping time. The OCR of the EDS and the pixel 
dwell time determine the number of counts in the&nbsp;individual 
pixel spectra, which sets the ultimate limit on the composi-
tional information that can be subsequently recovered from 
the XSI.&nbsp;The high throughput of SDD-EDS, especially when 
clusters of detectors are used, provides OCR of 105/s to 106/s, 
enabling various XSI imaging strategies determined by the 
number of counts in the individual pixel spectra.
</p>
<p> &ldquo;Flash Mapping&rdquo;
</p>
<p>By operating with a high OCR, major constituents can be 
mapped in less than 60 s, a mode of operation that can be 
termed &ldquo;flash&rdquo; mapping, which is useful for surveying 
unknowns. An example of a flash mapping survey of a leaded-
brass particle is shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 24.25, where the SEM-BSE 
image in . Fig.&nbsp;24.25a reveals a high-atomic-number  inclusion. 
</p>
<p>An XSI was recorded with 640 by 480&nbsp;pixels with a 64-μs pixel 
dwell at on OCR of 750&nbsp;kHz for a total mapping time of 20&nbsp;s. 
The raw intensity maps for Cu, Zn, and Pb and their color 
overlay are shown in . Fig.&nbsp;24.25b. While very noisy on the 
single pixel level, these maps nevertheless reveal the localiza-
tion of the lead corresponding as expected to the bright region 
in the SEM-BSE image. The color overlay, however, shows 
numerous dark areas within the particle which do not corre-
spond to Cu, Zn, or Pb. With this short pixel dwell, the pixel 
level EDS spectra contain only about 50 counts total, the effect 
of which can be seen in the noisy derived MAXIMUM PIXEL 
spectrum in . Fig.&nbsp; 24.26. (An additional derived spectrum, 
the RUNNING MAXIMUM PIXEL, which is averaged over 
three adjacent energy &ldquo;cards&rdquo; to reduce the effect of the low 
count, is also shown.) The SUM spectrum shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;24.26, consisting of all counts recorded in 20&nbsp;s, approxi-
mately 15 million, contains abundant information. In addition 
to the peaks for Cu, Zn,and Pb, a major peak for Ni is observed. 
When the raw elemental map for Ni is constructed from the 
XSI, the missing regions in . Fig.&nbsp;24.25b are filled in, as shown

to augment the information obtained from the atomic number 
contrast of the SEM-BSE image. In . Fig.&nbsp; 24.27b, the SEM-
BSE image easily distinguishes the Pb-rich inclusion from the 
brass matrix but shows no distinct contrast from the Ni-rich 
regions relative to the Cu-Zn brass matrix. Ni, Cu, and Zn are 
only separated by one unit of atomic number, so that the BSE 
atomic number contrast between these phases is very weak 
and dominated by the contrast produced by the Pb-rich region 
relative to the brass matrix. The SEM-BSE contrast situation is 
further complicated by the topographic contrast of the com-
plex surface of the particle. Element-specific compositional 
imaging reveals the details of the complex microstructure of 
this particle.

<p> High Count Mapping
</p>
<p>The strategy for elemental mapping data collection depends 
on the nature of the problem to be solved: the most critical 
question is typically, &ldquo;What concentration levels are of 
interest?&rdquo; If minor and trace level constituents are not 
important, then short duration (60&nbsp;s or less), low pixel den-
sity (256 &times; 256 or fewer) XSI maps with a high OCR will 
usually contain adequate counts, a minimum of approxi-
mately 50&ndash;500 counts per pixel spectrum, depending on 
the particular elements and overvoltage, to discern concen-
tration-based contrast for major constituents, as shown in 
</p>
<p>the examples in . Figs.&nbsp;24.25, 24.26, and 24.27. Of course, by 
accumulating more counts above this threshold, progres-
sively lower concentration contrast details can be revealed 
for the major constituents. For problems involving minor 
and/or trace constituents, longer pixel dwell times are nec-
essary to accumulate at least 500&ndash;5000 counts per pixel 
spectrum, and the beam current should be reduced to keep 
the dead-time generally below 10 % to minimize 
 coincidence peaks. This dead-time condition can be relaxed 
if the coincidence peaks, which are only produced by high 
count rate parent peaks associated with major constituents, 
do not interfere with the minor/trace constituent peaks of 
interest.
</p>
<p>An example of the compositional details that can be 
observed at the level of approximately 5000 counts per pixel 
spectrum is shown for a complex Zr-Ni-V alloy with minor 
Ti, Cr, Mn and Co in . Fig.&nbsp;24.28. Excellent gray-scale (after 
autoscaling) contrast is obtained between the phases which 
have relatively small changes in composition for the individ-
ual elements. Although the single pixel spectra do not have 
adequate counts for robust quantification, the analyst can use 
the images to form pixel masks that contain much higher 
total counts. The compositional values noted in . Fig.&nbsp;24.28 
are based on quantifying SUM spectra taken from the two 
phases that are specified by the arrows in the elemental maps, 
and the very small statistical error reported reflects the very 
high count SUM spectra.

While X-ray analysis can be performed in the Variable Pres-
sure Scanning Electron Microscope (VPSEM), it is not pos-
sible to perform uncompromised electron-excited X-ray 
microanalysis. The measured EDS spectrum is inevitably 
degraded by the effects of electron scattering with the atoms 
of the environmental gas in the specimen chamber before the 
beam reaches the specimen. The spectrum is always a com-
posite of X-rays generated by the unscattered electrons that 
remain in the focused beam and strike the intended target 
mixed with X-rays generated by the gas-scattered electrons 
that land elsewhere, micrometers to millimeters from the 
microscopic target of interest.
</p>
<p>It is critical to understand how severely the measured 
spectrum is compromised, what strategies can be followed to 
minimize these effects, and what &ldquo;workarounds&rdquo; can be 
applied in special circumstances to solve practical problems. 
The impact of gas-scattered electrons on the legitimacy of the 
analysis depends on the exact circumstances of the VPSEM 
conditions (beam energy, gas species, path length through 
the gas) and the characteristics of the specimen and its sur-
roundings. Gas scattering effects increase in significance as 
the constituent(s) of interest range in concentration from 
major (concentration C &gt; 0.1 mass fraction) to minor 
(0.01 &le; C &le; 0.1) to trace (C &lt; 0.01).
</p>
<p>25.1  Gas Scattering Effects in&nbsp;the&nbsp;VPSEM
</p>
<p>The VPSEM allows operation with elevated gas pressure in 
the specimen chamber, typically 10&nbsp;Pa to 1000&nbsp;Pa but even 
higher in the &ldquo;environmental SEM&rdquo; (ESEM), where 
</p>
<p> pressures of 2500&nbsp;Pa are possible, permitting liquid water 
to be maintained in equilibrium when the specimen is 
cooled to ~ 3&nbsp;&deg;C.&nbsp;Such specimen chamber pressures are sev-
eral orders of magnitude higher than that of a conventional 
high- vacuum SEM, which typically operates at 10&minus;2 Pa to 
10&minus;4 Pa or lower. As the beam emerges from the high vac-
uum of the electron column through the final aperture into 
the elevated pressure of the specimen chamber, elastic scat-
tering events with the gas atoms begin to occur. Although 
the volume density of the gas atoms in the chamber is very 
low compared to the density of a solid material, the path 
length that the beam electrons must travel typically ranges 
from 1&nbsp;mm to 10&nbsp;mm or more before reaching the speci-
men. As illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp; 25.1, when elastic scattering 
occurs along this path, the angular deviation causes beam 
electrons to substantially deviate out of the focused beam 
creating a &ldquo;skirt.&rdquo; The unscattered beam electrons follow 
the expected path defined by the objective lens field and 
land in the focused beam footprint identical to the situa-
tion at high vacuum but with reduced intensity due to the 
gas scattering events that rob the beam of electrons. The 
electrons that remain in the beam behave exactly as they 
would in a high vacuum SEM, creating the same interac-
tion volume and generating X-rays with exactly the same 
spatial distribution to produce identically the same spec-
trum. This &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; high vacuum equivalent spectrum rep-
resents the true microanalysis condition. However, this 
ideal spectrum is degraded by the remotely scattered elec-
trons in the skirt which generate characteristic and con-
tinuum (bremsstrahlung) X-rays from whatever material(s) 
they strike.

<p>The extent of the beam skirt can be estimated from the 
ideal gas law (the density of particles at a pressure p is given 
by n/V = p/RT, where n is the number of moles, V is the vol-
ume, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature) and by 
assuming single-event elastic scattering (Danilatos 1988):

</p>
<p>Z = atomic number of the gas
E = beam energy (keV)
p = pressure (Pa)
T = temperature (K)
L = path length in gas (m) (GPL)
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp; 25.2 plots the skirt radius for a beam energy of 
20&nbsp;keV as a function of the gas path length through oxygen at 
several different chamber pressures. For a pressure of 100&nbsp;Pa 
and a gas path length of 5&nbsp;mm, the skirt radius is calculated 
to be 30&nbsp;μm. Consider the change in scale due to gas scatter-
ing. The high vacuum microanalysis footprint can be esti-
mated with the Kanaya-Okayama range equation. For a 
copper specimen and E
</p>
<p>0

</p>
<p>K-O
 = 1.5&nbsp;μm, 
</p>
<p>which is a good estimate of the diameter of the interaction 
volume projected on the entrance surface, the &ldquo;microanalysis 
</p>
<p>footprint.&rdquo; The gas scattering skirt is thus a factor of 40 larger 
in diameter, but a factor of 1600 larger in area.
</p>
<p>While Eq. (25.1) is useful to estimate the extent of the gas 
scattering on the spatial resolution of X-ray microanalysis 
under VPSEM conditions, it provides no information on the 
relative fractions of the spectrum that arise from the unscat-
tered beam electrons (exactly equivalent to the high vacuum 
microanalysis footprint) and the skirt. The Monte Carlo simu-
lation embedded in NIST DTSA-II enables explicit treatment 
of gas scattering to provide detailed information on the 
unscattered beam electrons and the distribution of electrons 
scattered into the skirt. The VPSEM menu of DTSA-II is 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 25.3 and allows selection of the gas path 
length, the gas pressure, and the gas species (He, N

<p>or Ar). An example of a portion of the electron scattering

of oxygen with a 20-keV beam energy; the full table extends to 
1000&nbsp;μm. This data set is plotted as the cumulative electron 
intensity as a function of radial distance out to 50&nbsp;μm from the 
beam center in . Fig.&nbsp;25.4. For these conditions the unscat-
tered beam retains 0.70 of the beam intensity that enters the 
specimen chamber. The skirt out to a radius of 30&nbsp;μm contains 
a cumulative intensity of 0.84 of the incident beam current. To 
capture 0.95 of the total current for a 5-mm gas path length in

<p>100&nbsp;Pa of oxygen requires a radial distance of approximately 
190&nbsp;μm, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;25.5, which plots the skirt distribu-
tion out to 1000&nbsp;μm (1&nbsp;mm). The strong effect of the gas path 
length on the skirt radius, which follows a 3/2 exponent in the 
scattering Eq.&nbsp;25.1, can be seen in . Fig.&nbsp;25.5 in the plots for 
3&nbsp;mm, 5&nbsp;mm, and 10&nbsp;mm gas path lengths.
</p>
<p>The extent of the degradation of the measured EDS spec-
trum by gas scattering is illustrated in the experiment shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;25.6. The incident beam is placed at the center of a 
polished cross section of a 40&nbsp;wt % Cu&nbsp;&ndash; 60&nbsp;wt % Au alloy

<p>4&nbsp;mm through water vapor, the EDS spectra measured over a 
pressure range from 53&nbsp; Pa to 1600&nbsp; Pa are superimposed, 
showing the in-growth of the Al peak with increasing pres-
sure. Even at 53&nbsp;Pa, a detectable Al peak is observed, despite 
the beam center being 250&nbsp;μm away from the Al. As the pres-
sure is increased, the Al peak ranges from an apparent trace 
to minor and finally major constituent peak.
</p>
<p>DTSA-II also simulates the composite spectrum created 
by these two classes of electrons as they strike the speci-
men. Various configurations of two different materials can 
be specified, one that the unscattered beam strikes, for 
example, a particle, and the other by the skirt electrons, for 
example, the surrounding matrix. . Figure&nbsp; 25.7 shows 
spectra simulated for the example of . Fig.&nbsp; 25.6, the 
500-μm-diameter 40&nbsp; wt %Cu&ndash;60&nbsp; wt %Au wire in the Al 
disk with a 4-mm-gas path length through water vapor. The 
simulation of the lowest VPSEM gas pressure of 53&nbsp;Pa pro-
duces a low level Al peak similar to the experimental mea-
surement. Thus, even at this low pressure and short gas 
path length for which 89 % of the electrons remain in the 
focused beam, there are still gas- scattered electrons falling 
at least 250&nbsp;μm from the beam impact. As the pressure is 
progressively increased, the in- growth of the Al peak due to 
the skirt electrons is well modeled by the Monte Carlo 
simulation.
</p>
<p>25.1.1  Why Doesn&rsquo;t the&nbsp;EDS Collimator 
Exclude the&nbsp;Remote Skirt X-Rays?
</p>
<p>Gas scattering in the VPSEM mode always degrades the inci-
dent beam, transferring a significant fraction of the beam elec-
trons into the skirt. The radius of the skirt can reach a 
millimeter or more from the focused beam impact. It might be 
thought that the EDS collimator would restrict the acceptance 
area of the EDS to exclude most of the skirt. As shown in the 
schematic diagram in . Fig.&nbsp; 25.8, while a simple collimator 
acts to successfully shield the EDS from accepting X-rays pro-
duced by backscattered electrons striking the lens and cham-
ber walls, the acceptance volume near the column optic axis is 
quite large. The EDS acceptance is not defined by looking back 
at the detector from the specimen space as the cone of rays 
whose apex is at the beam impact on the specimen and whose 
base is the detector active area (the dashed red lines in 
. Fig.&nbsp;25.8). While the red lines define the solid angle of the 
detector for emission from the beam impact point, the accep-
tance region is actually defined by looking from the detector 
through the collimator at the specimen space (the dashed 
green lines in . Fig.&nbsp;25.8). The true area of acceptance can be 
readily determined by conducting X-ray mapping measure-
ments. . Fig.&nbsp; 25.9 shows a series of measurements of X-ray 
maps of a machined Al disk taken at the lowest available

<p> magnification (largest scan field) over a series of working dis-
tances. The false color scale shows the while the intensity is not 
uniform within a map, it generally varies by less than 30 % 
over the full map, a distance of millimeters, and moreover, as 
the maps are measured at different working distances, there is 
only about 30 % variation over the vertical range, which is con-
firmed by the plot of the intensity measured at the center of 
each map. Thus, X-rays generated throughout a large volume 
are accepted through the collimator by the EDS so that colli-
mation provides virtually no relief from the effects of remote 
X-ray generation caused by gas scattering in the VPSEM.
</p>
<p>25.1.2  Other Artifacts Observed in&nbsp;VPSEM 
X-Ray Spectrometry
</p>
<p>Inelastic scattering of the beam electrons and backscattered 
electrons with the atoms of the environmental gas causes 
</p>
<p>inner shell ionization leading to X-ray emission that contrib-
utes to the measured spectrum. The density of gas atoms 
(number/unit volume) is orders of magnitude lower than the 
density in the solid specimen, but the distance that the beam 
travels in the gas is orders of magnitude longer than it travels 
in the solid. The contribution of the environmental gas is 
illustrated for a simple experiment in . Fig.&nbsp;25.10, where the 
beam strikes a carbon target at a series of different pressures. 
The in-growth of the oxygen peak from ionization of the 
water vapor used as the environmental gas can be seen. A 
detectable oxygen peak is seen for pressures of 133&nbsp;Pa (1&nbsp;torr) 
and higher for this particular gas path length (6&nbsp;mm) and 
beam energy (20&nbsp;keV). . Figure&nbsp;25.11 shows an example of 
the contribution of the environmental gas to the spectrum 
measured from a 50&nbsp;μm diameter glass shard with the com-
position listed in the figure placed on a carbon substrate. At 
the lower pressure (266 pA = 2&nbsp;torr) for the gas path length 
used (3&nbsp; mm), the footprint of the focused beam and skirt

<p>remain within the 50&nbsp;μm diameter glass shard, as evidenced 
by the negligible C intensity in the spectrum. An O peak is 
also observed, at least some of which is actually from the 
specimen. When the pressure is increased by a factor of five 
to 1330&nbsp; Pa (10&nbsp; torr), the C intensity rises significantly 
because the skirt now extends beyond the boundary of the 
particle, and the O peak intensity increases by a factor of 
four, all of which is due to the environmental gas. It is also 
worth noting that in addition to characteristic X-rays from 
the environmental gas, there is increased bremsstrahlung 
generation as well from the inelastic scattering of beam and 
backscattered electrons with the gas atoms. In . Fig.&nbsp;25.11, 
the background is substantially higher for the spectrum 
measured at the elevated pressure, leading to a reduced 
peak-to-background, which is easily seen for the Zn L-family 
and Al K-L

 peaks, an effect which makes for poorer limits of 
</p>
<p>detection.
</p>
<p>If the environmental gas can contribute to the spec-
trum, can the gas also absorb X-rays from the specimen? 
Because of the low gas density, this effect might be expected 
to be negligible, and as listed in . Table&nbsp;25.2, which is cal-
culated for a 40 &ndash;mm-path through the gas from the X-ray 
source at the beam impact on the specimen to the EDS, for 
the lowest pressure considered, 10&nbsp; Pa, over 99 % of the 
X-rays of all energies leaving the specimen in the direction 
of the detector arrive there, even for F K, the energy of 
which, 0.677&nbsp; keV, is just above the O K-shell absorption 
energy, 0.535&nbsp;keV, which results in a large mass absorption 
coefficient. When the pressure is increased to 100&nbsp;Pa, the 
loss of F K due to absorption increases to ~ 6 %, and at a 
pressure of 2500&nbsp;Pa (18.8&nbsp;torr), ~ 80 % of the F K radiation 
is lost to gas absorption, and even Al K-L
</p>
<p>2
 suffers a 20 % 
</p>
<p>loss in intensity compared to the conventional high vac-
uum SEM situation.

<p>25.2  What Can Be&nbsp;Done To&nbsp;Minimize gas 
Scattering in&nbsp;VPSEM?
</p>
<p>Manipulating the parameters in Eq. (25.1) provides the basis 
for minimizing, but not eliminating, the effects of gas scatter-
ing:
 1. Z, atomic number of the scattering gas: By lowering the 
</p>
<p>atomic number of the gas, the skirt radius is reduced. 
This effect is illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;25.12, which is derived 
from DTSA-II Monte Carlo simulations comparing the 
skirt radius for He and O
</p>
<p>2
 for a 10-mm gas path length 
</p>
<p>and 100-Pa gas pressure with a beam energy E
0
 = 20&nbsp;keV.
</p>
<p> 2. E, beam energy (keV). Operating at the highest possible 
beam energy reduces the gas scattering skirt.
</p>
<p> 3. p, the gas pressure (Pa): Operating with the lowest pos-
sible gas pressure minimizes the gas scattering skirt
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25451
</p>
<p> 4. T, the sample chamber temperature (K): The scattering 
skirt is reduced by operating at the lowest possible tem-
perature.
</p>
<p> 5. L, the gas path length (m). The shorter the gas path 
length, the smaller the gas scattering skirt, as shown in  
. Fig.&nbsp;25.4, where the skirt is compared for gas path 
lengths of 3&nbsp;mm, 5&nbsp;mm, and 10&nbsp;mm. Note that the gas 
path length appears in Eq. (25.1) with a 3/2 power, so 
that the skirt radius is more sensitive to this parameter 
than the other parameters in Eq. (25.1). A modification 
to the vacuum system of the VPSEM that minimizes the 
gas path length consists of using a small diameter tube to 
extend the high vacuum of the electron column into the 
sample chamber.
</p>
<p>25.2.1  Workarounds To&nbsp;Solve Practical 
Problems
</p>
<p>Gas scattering effects can be minimized but not avoided, 
and for many VPSEM measurements and in situ experi-
ments, the microscopist/microanalyst may be significantly 
constrained in the extent to which any of the parameters in 
Eq. (25.1) can actually be changed to reduce the gas scatter-
ing skirt without losing the advantages of VPSEM opera-
tion. The measured EDS spectrum is always compromised, 
but by carefully choosing the problems to study, successful 
X-ray analysis can still be performed. A useful way to con-
sider the impact of gas scattering is the general concentra-
tion level at which the remote scattering corrupts the 
measured spectrum:
</p>
<p>Major constituent: concentration C &gt; 0.1 mass fraction
Minor constituent: 0.01 &le; C &le; 0.1
Trace constituent: C &lt; 0.01
</p>
<p>Depending on the exact nature of the specimen, gas scat-
tering will almost always introduce spectral artifacts at the 
trace and minor constituent levels, and in severe cases arti-
facts will appear at the level of apparent major constitu-
ents.
</p>
<p>25.2.2  Favorable Sample Characteristics
</p>
<p>Given that the LVSEM operating conditions have been 
selected to minimize the gas scattering skirt, what specimen 
types are most likely to yield useful microanalysis results? If 
most of the gas scattering skirt falls on background material 
that contains an element or elements that are different from 
the elements of the target and of no interest, then by follow-
ing a measurement protocol to identify the extraneous ele-
ments, the measured spectrum can still have value for 
identifying the elements within the target area, always recog-
nizing that the target is being excited by the focused beam 
and the skirt.
</p>
<p> Particle Analysis
</p>
<p>Particle samples comprise a broad class of problems related to 
the environment, technology, forensics, failure analysis, and 
other areas. Particles are very often insulating in nature so that 
a conductive coating is required for examination in the con-
ventional high vacuum SEM, and the complex morphologies

of particles often make it difficult to apply a suitable coating. 
The VPSEM with its charge dissipation through gas ionization 
is an attractive alternative to achieve successful particle imag-
ing. When VPSEM X-ray analysis measurements are needed 
to characterize particles, specimen preparation is critical to 
achieve a useful result. There are many methods available for 
particle preparation, but the general goal for successful 
VPSEM X-ray analysis is to broadly disperse the particles on a 
suitable substrate so that the unscattered beam and the inner-
most intense portion of the skirt immediately surrounding 
the beam can be placed on individual particles without excit-
ing nearby particles. The more distant portions of the beam 
skirt may still excite other particles in the dispersion, but the 
relative fraction of the electrons that falls on these particles is 
likely to be sufficiently small that the artifacts introduced in 
the measured spectrum will be equivalent to trace (C &lt; 0.01 
mass fraction) constituents.
 1. When particles are collected on a smooth (i.e., not tortu-
</p>
<p>ous path) medium such as a porous polycarbonate filter, 
the loaded filter can be studied directly in the VPSEM 
with no preparation other than to attach a portion of the 
filter to a support stub. Prior to attempting X-ray mea-
surements of individual particles, the X-ray spectrum of 
the filter material should be measured under the VPSEM 
operating conditions as the first stage of determining the 
analytical blank (that is, the spectral contributions of all 
the materials involved in the preparation except the 
specimen itself). In addition to revealing the elemental 
constituents of the filter, this blank spectrum will also 
reveal the contribution of the environmental gas to the 
spectrum.
</p>
<p> 2. When particles are to be transferred from the collection 
medium, such as a tortuous path filter, or simply obtained 
from a loose mass in a container, the choice of the sample 
substrate is the first question to resolve. Conceding that 
VPSEM operation will lead to significant remote scat-
tering that will excite the substrate, the sample substrate 
should be chosen to consist of an element that is not of 
interest in the analysis of individual particles. Carbon 
is a typical choice for the substrate material, but if the 
analysis of carbon in the particles is important, then an 
alternative material such as beryllium (but beware of the 
health hazards of beryllium and its oxide) or boron can 
be selected. If certain higher atomic number elements can 
be safely ignored in the analysis, then additional materials 
may be suitable for substrates, such as aluminum, silicon, 
</p>
<p>germanium, or gold (often as a thick film evaporated on 
silicon). Again, whatever the choice of substrate, the X-ray 
spectrum of the bare substrate should be measured to 
establish the analytical blank prior to analyzing particles 
on that substrate.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;25.13a shows a VPSEM image of a particle cluster 
prepared on carbon tape (which has a blank spectrum con-
sisting of major C and minor O from the polymer base) and 
the EDS X-ray spectrum obtained with the beam placed on 
particle &ldquo;A&rdquo;. The spectrum is seen to contain a high intensity 
peak for Si, lower intensity peaks for O, Al, and K, and peaks 
just at the threshold of detection for Ca, Ti, and Fe. With the 
other particles nearby, how much of this spectrum can be 
reliably assigned to particle &ldquo;A&rdquo;? A local &ldquo;operational blank&rdquo; 
can be measured by placing the beam on several nearby sub-
strate locations so that focused beam only excites the sub-
strate while the skirt continues to excite the specimen over its 
extended reach. Examples of the &ldquo;working blanks&rdquo; for this 
particular specimen are shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 25.13b, c and are 
revealed to be surprisingly similar, considering the separa-
tion of location &ldquo;BL3&rdquo; from &ldquo;BL1&rdquo; and the particle array. 
Inspection of these working blanks show Al and Si at the 
minor level, and Ca and Fe at the trace level, as estimated 
from the peak-to-background ratio. Thus, the interpretation 
of the spectrum of particle &ldquo;A&rdquo; can make use of the local ana-
lytical blank, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;25.13d. The major Al and Si 
peaks are not significantly perturbed by the low blank contri-
butions for these elements, and the minor K is not present in 
the working blank and therefore it can be considered valid. 
However, the low levels of Ca and Fe observed in the blank 
are similar to those in the spectrum on particle &ldquo;A&rdquo;, and thus 
they should be removed these from consideration as legiti-
mate trace constituents. Note that despite the size of particle 
&ldquo;A,&rdquo; which is approximately 50&nbsp;μm in its longest dimension, it 
must be remembered that measurement sensitivity to any 
possible heterogeneity within particle &ldquo;A&rdquo; is likely to be lost in 
the VPSEM mode because of the large fraction of the inci-
dent current that is transferred within the 25-μm radius, as 
demonstrated in . Table&nbsp;25.1. Another example of the use of 
the working blank is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;25.13e for particle &ldquo;D&rdquo;. 
Here the Ca is much higher than in the working blank, and so 
it can be considered a legitimate particle constituent, as can 
the Mg, which is not in the working blank. The low Fe peak is 
similar in both the particle spectrum and the working blank, 
so it must not be considered legitimate.

<p>25.2.3  Unfavorable Sample Characteristics
</p>
<p>EDS analysis in VPSEM is most problematic for specimens 
consisting of densely packed microscopic features, for exam-
ple, most solid materials, natural and synthetic, with a micro-
structure. The measured EDS X-ray spectrum in such a case 
depends very strongly on the VPSEM conditions, the dimen-
sions of the target area of interest, and the exact nature of the 
surrounding microstructure. An example is presented in 
. Fig.&nbsp;25.14, which shows the microstructure of Raney nickel, 
an aluminum-nickel catalyst. Based on the contrast in this 
</p>
<p>SEM-BSE image, there are three different phases present 
denoted D, I, and B, with different Al/Ni ratios. The spectral 
intensities for Al and Ni show differences in the low pressure 
EDS spectra shown in . Fig.&nbsp;25.15a that are sufficient to read-
ily distinguish the phases despite the gas scattering 
(E
</p>
<p>0
 = 20&nbsp; keV; 50&nbsp; Pa; water vapor; 6-mm gas path length). 
</p>
<p>When the pressure is increased to 665&nbsp;Pa, two of the phases 
can no longer be distinguished in the EDS spectrum shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;25.15b. This loss of phase recognition is also seen as 
a loss of contrast in X-ray mapping, as seen in the elemental 
intensity maps shown in . Fig.&nbsp;25.16a, b.

<p>26.1.1  SEM
</p>
<p>The starting point is a scanning electron microscope (SEM) 
with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. A good and 
useful measurement doesn&rsquo;t necessarily require a fancy 
SEM.&nbsp;Almost any functional SEM will do. However, there are 
a handful of basic requirements.
</p>
<p> 5 The SEM should be capable of beam energies of at least 
15&nbsp;keV (20&ndash;30 keV maximum is better). While it is pos-
sible to make many measurements at lower voltages, 
15&nbsp;keV is a useful practical minimum to begin an analyti-
cal measurement campaign.
</p>
<p> 5 The probe current must remain stable to within a per-
cent or better for minutes or hours. Most thermal 
sources (tungsten filament, LaB
</p>
<p>6
 or Schottky field-
</p>
<p>emitters) will work fine. Cold field emitters can be 
problematic due to current drift issues. The more stable 
the probe current the easier and the more accurate 
standards-based measurements will be. Note that 
&ldquo;standardless&rdquo; analysis methods do not require a stable 
beam current or knowledge of the value of the beam 
current. While convenient, this is bought at the price of 
losing the analytical total, which has considerable 
value.
</p>
<p>26.1.2  EDS Detector
</p>
<p>Any functional EDS detector/pulse processor system is likely 
to be adequate. Older Si(Li)-EDS detectors with poorer reso-
lution and less throughput may require patience and may 
produce slightly less good results. The one caveat is that some 
older detectors utilize thick beryllium windows that absorb 
</p>
<p>virtually all X-rays below 1-keV photon energy. These 
 detectors will not be able to measure X-rays from C, O, F, and 
other light elements. If you need to measure these elements 
you will need a detector with a thin polymer (&ldquo;Moxtek&rdquo;) or 
other high-transparency window. In the end, patience and 
care is more important than owning the latest equipment.
</p>
<p> 5 Resolution at Mn K-L
2,3
</p>
<p> of 150&nbsp;eV or better
 5 Throughput of 1,000 cps second or better on bulk Cu
 5 A &ldquo;light element&rdquo; window capable of seeing C
 5 Software to acquire spectra and export the spectra in the 
msa (ISO-22029, 2012) format
</p>
<p>26.1.3  Probe Current Measurement Device
</p>
<p>You will need a mechanism to measure the probe current&mdash;
a measure of the number of electrons striking the sample. 
There are two ways to measure the probe current. You can 
measure the probe current directly using a Faraday cup and 
picoammeter. Alternatively, you can monitor the probe 
current indirectly by measuring an X-ray spectrum of a 
specific element, for example, Cu, obtain the integrated 
spectrum count, e.g., from 0.1&nbsp;keV to E
</p>
<p>0
, and then use the 
</p>
<p>proportionality between probe current and X-ray emission 
to calibrate the probe current over the course of a measure-
ment campaign.
</p>
<p> Direct Measurement: Using a&nbsp;Faraday Cup 
and&nbsp;Picoammeter
</p>
<p>The classic procedure to measure the probe current is with a 
Faraday cup and a picoammeter. Some instruments integrate 
a Faraday cup into the stage. A few instruments implement a 
Faraday cup as a retractable device within the optics column. 
Most SEMs require a user-provided Faraday cup.
</p>
<p>To perform a beam current measurement you will need 
the following:
</p>
<p>A Faraday Cup
</p>
<p>A Faraday cup is essentially a hole which electrons enter but 
never leave. It consists of a metal aperture with a 10&ndash;100-
μm diameter orifice mounted over a millimeter-diameter 
void, for example, a blind hole drilled in a block. Carbon is 
an excellent material for the block because its low backscat-
tered electron (BSE) coefficient minimizes re-backscatter-
ing from the walls of the hole. For a metal block, the interior 
of the void can be coated in a material with a low backscat-
ter coefficient (such as carbon dag) to minimize possible 
loss through multiple backscatter events. The Faraday cup 
should be accessible on the SEM stage simultaneously with 
the specimen so it just a matter of driving the stage to the 
appropriate locations, which is usually an automatable 
function. It should NOT be necessary to break the vacuum 
and interrupt the specimen measurements to insert the 
Faraday cup.
</p>
<p>kOverview
</p>
<p>This section is intended to take you step-by-step through 
</p>
<p>the process of making a careful standards-based quanti-
</p>
<p>tative measure of composition. It discusses the instru-
</p>
<p>mentation, preparation, data acquisition, data analysis, 
</p>
<p>reliability checks, and data reporting&mdash;all the steps an 
</p>
<p>expert takes to ensure a high-quality, reliable measure-
</p>
<p>ment. It is intended to be a golden path which if followed 
</p>
<p>carefully will take the reader to the intended outcome 
</p>
<p>with the minimum of diversions. As such, it only covers 
</p>
<p>measurements of bulk, homogeneous, carefully prepared 
</p>
<p>samples and avoids consideration of special cases like 
</p>
<p>particles, fibers, or thin films.

</p>
<p>Electrically Isolated Stage
</p>
<p>The stage should be electrically isolated from the instrument 
ground. The electrically isolated stage is connected by a sin-
gle wire to a vacuum electrical feed-through so that the only 
path to ground passes through the connected picoammeter.
</p>
<p> 5 A picoammeter&mdash;A current meter capable of measuring 
currents between picoamps and hundreds of nanoamps.
</p>
<p> 5 A cable to connect the vacuum feed-through to the 
 picoammeter.
</p>
<p>Procedure:
 5 Drive the SEM stage to the location of the Faraday cup, 
and center the aperture in the SEM image. Zoom up in 
magnification until the aperture fills the screen, and then 
further increase the magnification so the scanned field is 
well within the aperture. Choose the appropriate current 
range on the picoammeter and read the current.
</p>
<p> 5 Note: When the beam is not within the Faraday cup, the 
current flowing to the picoammeter will represent the 
&ldquo;specimen current,&rdquo; which is the beam current minus the 
backscattered electron and secondary electron emission. 
Because η and δ change with composition, specimen cur-
rent is NOT a useful measure of absolute beam current 
or of stability.
</p>
<p> Indirect Measurement: Using a&nbsp; 
Calibration Spectrum
</p>
<p>A carefully collected spectrum can be used as an alternative 
to a Faraday cup and picoammeter. Ultimately, the probe 
current always appears in formulas for standards-based 
quantitative analysis as a ratio. We can therefore replace the 
probe current with any quantity which is proportional to the 
probe current, even if we don&rsquo;t know the proportionality 
constant. A carefully collected spectrum can provide such a 
metric.
</p>
<p>The calibration spectrum must be collected&mdash;
 1. At a consistent beam energy
 2. At a consistent working distance (The same working dis-
</p>
<p>tance that the unknown and standard spectra are col-
lected)
</p>
<p> 3. On a consistent material (flat, polished)
 4. For a consistent live-time (acquisition duration)
</p>
<p>Typically, a pure metal such as copper, nickel, aluminum, 
silicon, among others, is used and the number of counts in 
the range of energies around the K characteristic lines is 
used as the proxy for the probe current, or the entire spec-
trum can be integrated from a threshold, for example, 
0.1&nbsp;keV to E
</p>
<p>0
.
</p>
<p>Precise calibration of the probe current using a spectrum 
takes patience. For 0.1 % precision, you will need to integrate 
at least 1,000,000 counts in the range of energies used for the 
calibration.
</p>
<p>Disadvantages:
 1. It takes longer to acquire a calibration spectrum of 
</p>
<p>equivalent precision than it takes to measure the probe 
current with a picoammeter.
</p>
<p>Advantages:
1. The polished standard used for calibration can be a 
</p>
<p>member of the set being used for the analysis so that no 
extra material or preparation needed.
</p>
<p>2. A calibration spectrum can compensate for slight differ-
ences in measurement geometry.
</p>
<p>3. A Faraday cup and picoammeter aren&rsquo;t necessary.
4. The calibration spectrum can also be used for quality 
</p>
<p>control purposes.
</p>
<p>26.1.4  Conductive Coating
</p>
<p>Many samples and standard materials are non-conductive 
and need to be coated with a nanoscale coating of a conduc-
tive material. Typical equipment used includes&mdash;
 1. Carbon coater (usually the best choice for X-ray micro-
</p>
<p>analysis unless C, N, or O must be optimized in the anal-
ysis)
</p>
<p> 2. AuPd or other heavy metal/metal alloy coater (usually 
chosen when secondary electron image performance is 
important)
</p>
<p>The coater should be capable of laying a controlled thickness 
of a conductive film over the sample. Most coaters rotate to 
ensure that all sides of the sample are coated. Use the thinnest 
coating that discharges the specimen, for example, 5&ndash;10&nbsp;nm 
of carbon should be sufficient, or 1&ndash;3&nbsp;nm of a high Z coating 
such as Au or Au-Pd.
</p>
<p>CRITICAL: The applied coating must actually be con-
nected to electrical ground. Do not assume that an electrical 
path is automatically established by the coating. The sides of 
a tall insulating specimen may not actually become ade-
quately coated. Use a strip of conducting adhesive tape from 
the coated surface to the conducting support stub to ensure 
the electrical path.
</p>
<p>26.2  Sample Preparation
</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you are performing standards-based 
or standardless quantitative analysis, you will need to ensure 
that your unknowns and standards, if used, are prepared in a 
suitable fashion for analysis. How you prepare your samples 
will depend very much on the type of samples that you ana-
lyze. For the most accurate analysis of bulk materials, includ-
ing that utilizing the standardless protocol, the specimen 
must be prepared with a flat surface, with the degree of flat-

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>464
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>ness becoming increasingly critical for measurements with 
X-rays having energies below 1&nbsp;keV&mdash;e.g., Be, B, C, N, O, F&mdash;
where the surface roughness should be reduced below 50&nbsp;nm 
root mean square. Some samples require very little prepara-
tion (e.g., a silicon wafer) and others (anything that isn&rsquo;t flat) 
require a lot. You may need to embed the samples and stan-
dards in epoxy mounting medium (preferably conductive) 
and use suitable equipment to grind and polish the samples. 
Appropriate preparation protocols are so specialized that 
rather than provide an exhaustive list of possible procedures, 
the analyst is referred to the rich literature on sample prepa-
ration:

</p>
<p>26.2.1  Standard Materials
</p>
<p>Standards are specially prepared materials that serve to pro-
vide X-ray data for the elements present in the unknown. You 
will need a standard for each element in the unknown mate-
rial. Note that some standards can serve for two or more ele-
ments, for example, FeS2.
</p>
<p>To be useful, a standard must be&mdash;
 1. Suitably sized&mdash;Practically speaking, most standards range 
</p>
<p>in size from tens of micrometers to a tens of millimeters
 2. Polished to a smooth, flat surface with surface texture of 
</p>
<p>less than 100&nbsp;nm (50&nbsp;nm for low energy X-rays like oxy-
gen)
</p>
<p> 3. Mounted in a manner that facilitates placement on the 
stage perpendicular to the beam
</p>
<p> 4. Conductive or coated with a conductive material
 5. There are several different classes of standards, in order 
</p>
<p>of the ease of use:
 (i) Pure element standards:
</p>
<p>The easiest standards to use are pure elements and 
this is where a novice should start whenever 
possible.
</p>
<p> (ii) Simple compound standards:
Some elements are not stable as pure elements&mdash;N, 
O, F, Cl, Br, S&mdash;and must be provided as com-
pounds. The easiest to use are typically stable, 
stoichiometric compounds like alumina (Al
</p>
<p>2
O
</p>
<p>3
) or 
</p>
<p>calcium fluoride (CaF
2
). With stable stoichiometric 
</p>
<p>compounds, the true composition of the standard 
is unambiguous. Ideally, the compound is chosen 
so that there are no interferences between the 
element&rsquo;s characteristic peaks.
</p>
<p> (iii) Complex standards:
In many cases, complex standards similar to the 
unknown sample will produce the most accurate 
results. However, complex standards often are more 
difficult to work with and it is often hard to find 
reliable compositional data. Use of complex stan-
dards is an advanced topic and rarely justified 
unless suitable pure element and simple compound 
standards are not available.
</p>
<p>26.2.2  Peak Reference Materials
</p>
<p>Peak reference spectra serve as examples of the shape of an 
element&rsquo;s characteristic peaks. A peak reference can serve as 
a reference for one or more families. Standards materials can 
be used as references if there are no interferences for that ele-
ment. Paradoxically, some materials suitable to serve as peak 
references are not suitable for use as standards, generally due 
to instability under the electron beam; for example, BaCl
</p>
<p>2
 
</p>
<p>provides an excellent peak reference for the Ba M-family, but 
it is unstable under electron bombardment and thus cannot 
serve as a standard.
</p>
<p>26.3  Initial Set-Up
</p>
<p>26.3.1  Calibrating the&nbsp;EDS Detector
</p>
<p>Most EDS detectors allow you to configure two different char-
acteristics of the detector&mdash;the pulse process time and the 
energy calibration. Some detectors provide other more 
advanced options. You will need to consult the manufacturer&rsquo;s 
documentation to determine the optimal setting for these 
parameters. In general, the goal should be to ensure that the 
detector is configured the same way day-in/day-out even if it 
means making small compromises to the ultimate performance.
</p>
<p> Selecting a&nbsp;Pulse Process Time Constant
</p>
<p> 1. Most EDS detectors will allow you to make a trade-off 
between X-ray throughput and detector resolution. 
Higher throughput comes at the price of poorer detector 
resolution. This setting is called different things by vari-
ous vendors&mdash;throughput, pulse processor setting, shap-
ing time, or time-constant.
</p>
<p> 2. Typically, a pulse processor time constant selected in the 
middle of the allowed range represents the best trade-off. 
Despite common belief, the highest resolution setting is 
rarely the optimal choice as this setting is usually accom-
panied by severe throughput limitations. Usually, it is 
better to select a moderate resolution and obtain a mod-
erate throughput.
</p>
<p> 3. On a modern silicon drift detector (SDD), throughput is 
typically not limited by the pulse-process time but rather 
through pulse pile-up (coincidence) events. Selecting a 
very fast process time won&rsquo;t actually improve usable 
throughput.
</p>
<p> Chapter 26 &middot; Energy Dispersive X-Ray Microanalysis Checklist</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26465
</p>
<p> 4. Be sure to turn off &ldquo;adaptive shaping&rdquo; or other mecha-
nisms that adapt the process time dynamically depend-
ing upon X-ray flux. Adaptive shaping changes the shape 
of the characteristic peaks as the count rate varies due to 
variations in&nbsp;local composition and makes linear peak 
fitting less accurate.
</p>
<p> Energy Calibration
</p>
<p> 1. Select one material that you will always use to calibrate 
your detector. Mount a piece of it near your Faraday cup. 
Copper is a good choice but there are other materials 
that have both low energy and higher energy X-ray 
peaks that can be used for calibration.
</p>
<p> 2. Select a channel width and channel count that fully cov-
ers the range of beam energies that you may use. A 
width of 10&nbsp;eV/channel and 2,048 channels is a good 
choice for a 20-keV beam energy. A width of 10&nbsp;eV/
channel and 4,096 channels is suitable for higher-energy 
work. Since EDS spectra comprise relatively small size 
files and computer storage is inexpensive, consider 5&nbsp;eV 
per channel, especially for low photon energy work to 
provide adequate channels to describe the peak. 
Whatever choice is made, it is important to consistently 
use that choice.
</p>
<p> 3. Each day before you start collecting data, collect and 
store an initial spectrum from your selected calibration 
material, for example, Cu. Use this spectrum and your 
vendor&rsquo;s software to calibrate the energy axis. Usually 
this involves adjusting the electronics to ensure that 
the measured peaks are centered around the correct 
channels. Most modern detectors automatically and 
dynamically adjust the zero offset and the calibration is 
just a matter of the software automatically selecting a 
gain that produces the desired number of eV/channel. 
Older detectors may require a manual gain and zero 
offset adjustment using external potentiometers. 
Regardless of the mechanism, at 10&nbsp;eV/channel a 0.1 % 
mis-calibration will correspond to a single channel 
error in the position of a peak at 10&nbsp;keV, so the detec-
tor calibration should ideally be maintained to better 
than 0.1 %. Fortunately, modern detectors are able to 
hold this precision of calibration for days or weeks.
</p>
<p> 4. Once the detector is calibrated, set the beam energy and 
probe current to established nominal values and collect a 
spectrum for a established live time. Save this spectrum 
as a demonstration that your detector is performing cor-
rectly. DTSA-II provides tools to extract and track per-
formance metrics and then plot the results over time as a 
control chart.
</p>
<p> Quality Control
</p>
<p>Sooner or later, you will be asked by a client to demonstrate 
that your instrument was performing correctly when their 
data was collected. The easiest way to satisfy this require-
ment and to impress the client is to keep a long term record 
and present the data as a control chart. DTSA-II provides 
 functionality which permits you to archive the spectra you 
</p>
<p>just used to calibrate your detector as a record of the detec-
tors performance. The program extracts efficiency, calibra-
tion and other pieces of instrumental data and records 
them in a database. This database can then be exported as 
control charts or tabulations. It is a nice way to make the 
most of the calibration data you have already spent the time 
to collect.
</p>
<p> Maintaining the&nbsp;Working Distance/ 
Specimen- to- EDS Distance
</p>
<p>Maintaining consistent experimental conditions is critical 
for achieving rigorous quantitative microanalysis. A criti-
cal parameter is the specimen-to-EDS distance, S
</p>
<p>EDS
, since 
</p>
<p>the solid angle of the EDS varies as 1/S2
EDS
</p>
<p>. The SEM and/or 
EDS manufacturer(s) will have specified the ideal SEM 
working distance (WD) at which the EDS central axis 
intersects the SEM optic axis. An electron probe microana-
lyzer uses a fixed-focus optical microscope with a very 
shallow depth-of- focus to bring the specimen to this ideal 
WD position (to which the wavelength dispersive spec-
trometers are also focused) on a consistent basis. While 
very useful, such an optical microscope is rarely available 
on an analytical SEM, so that another method must be used 
to select the working distance properly and consistently. 
The following procedure assumes the use of a flat polished 
specimen.
 1.  Load the specimen so that its Z-height is approximately 
</p>
<p>correct for the ideal working distance specified by the 
manufacturer. Most SEMs provide a mechanical mount-
ing reference frame to approximately set this initial 
specimen altitude.
</p>
<p> 2. Using the manufacturer&rsquo;s specified value of the ideal 
SEM working distance for EDS (e.g., 10&nbsp;mm), set the 
SEM objective lens strength to focus at this optimal 
working distance, making use of whatever objective 
lens meter reading is available to monitor this adjust-
ment.
</p>
<p> 3. Select a low magnification to begin (e.g., 100&times;). Despite 
care in polishing, there are almost always a few fine 
scale scratches or other irregularities to be found. 
Locate one, and use the stage Z-motion (i.e., motion 
along the optic axis of the SEM) to bring this scratch 
into approximate focus, without adjusting the objective 
lens strength. Increase the magnification in stages to 
5000&times; and refine the focus with the Z-axis motion, not 
by changing the objective lens strength. If the SEM 
stage automation system permits, save this 
Z-parameter.
</p>
<p> 4.  This procedure is likely to be more reproducible at lower 
probe currents where the convergence angle is larger 
and depth-of-focus is smaller.
</p>
<p> 5.  Consistency is critical. Always collect your spectra at 
this ideal working distance. Before collecting each spec-
trum ensure that the sample surface is at the optimal 
working distance by setting the objective lens/working 
distance and bringing the sample into focus using the 
vertical stage axis.
</p>
<p>26.3 &middot;  Initial Set-Up</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>466
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p> Sample Orientation
</p>
<p>Sample orientation is also a critical parameter to hold con-
stant.
 1. The ideal sample orientation has the sample perpendicu-
</p>
<p>lar to the electron column&rsquo;s optical axis. The electrons 
strike the sample normal to the surface and their behav-
ior in the sample is best understood.
</p>
<p> 2. Tilts of a few degrees from the ideal perpendicular ori-
entation can significantly degrade the accuracy of quan-
titative measurements for highly absorbed X-rays, such 
as low energy photons below 1&nbsp;keV.
</p>
<p> 3. The best way to ensure that the samples are oriented cor-
rectly is by checking the orientation of the stage using a 
spirit level and then ensuring that the sample&rsquo;s surface is 
parallel to the stage datum. Check both orientations as a 
stage may be perpendicular to the optic axis in one 
direction (x or y) and tilted on the other (y or x).
</p>
<p> 4. Sometimes it is not possible to use a level to ensure ori-
entation, in these cases you may be able to use a flat por-
tion of the sample and the image focus to ensure that the 
sample maintains focus as the stage moves. A 1&deg; tilt cor-
responds to a change of working distance of 17&nbsp;μm over 
a travel of 1&nbsp;mm.
</p>
<p> Detector Position
</p>
<p>Maintaining the position of the detector relative to the 
sample is critical. The sample position aspect of this has 
been discussed above in terms of setting the proper work-
ing distance. On some instruments, it is also possible to 
position the X-ray detector along a slide mount with a screw 
drive (manual or motor driven) that moves the detector 
along its central axis out of the chamber and away from the 
sample.
 1. Usually, the optimal location for the detector is as close 
</p>
<p>to the sample as possible without obstruction or colli-
sion.
</p>
<p> 2. The detector snout should not touch anything inside the 
chamber. The snout should be electrically isolated from 
the chamber.
</p>
<p> 3. The position of the detector should be maintained by 
setting a stop that ensures that the detector is returned 
to precisely the same position each time it is removed 
and returned.
</p>
<p> 4. The solid angle and therefore also the throughput is a 
function of the distance of the detector to the sample 
squared. Thus small variations in this distance can con-
tribute to large differences in measured X-ray intensities. 
A 1 % error in distance leads to a 2 % error in intensity.
</p>
<p> 5. On a few instruments, the take-off angle can be varied. 
A single take-off angle should be selected and main-
tained. All else remaining the same, higher take-off 
angles are better than lower ones.
</p>
<p> Probe Current
</p>
<p> 1. It is not necessary to maintain exactly the same probe 
current throughout the entire measurement process but 
it is beneficial to try to maintain the probe current to a 
</p>
<p>narrow range because this minimizes errors resulting 
from non-linearities in the picoammeter.
</p>
<p> 2. Typically, the probe current is selected to maximize the 
X-ray throughput on a selected material (e.g., Cu), while 
simultaneously maintaining a low rate of coincidence 
events (pulse pile-up).
</p>
<p> 3. Coincidence events occur at all throughputs but become 
much more common at higher throughputs (scaling 
roughly as the square of the throughput). The acceptable 
coincidence rate is composition dependent. Lower probe 
currents and lower coincidence rates are required for 
trace element analysis and when a coincidence event 
occurs at the same energy as a minor elemental peak.
</p>
<p> 4. Older Si(Li) detectors with lower throughputs typically 
had less of an issue with coincidence events and main-
taining a dead time of 30 % was close to optimal for all 
vendors and most samples.
</p>
<p> 5. Silicon drift detectors are capable of higher throughput 
but are also more susceptible to coincidence events so an 
acceptable coincidence rate, rather than a specific dead 
time, should be used as a metric to select the probe cur-
rent. Note that coincidence depends strongly on how 
many high-count-rate peaks are present in the spectrum, 
so the degree of coincidence will vary with composition.
</p>
<p> 6. A good starting point is to observe the coincidence 
events that occur with alumina (Al
</p>
<p>2
O
</p>
<p>3
). Adjust the 
</p>
<p>probe current to maintain the amplitude of the largest 
coincidence peak on this challenging sample as less than 
1 % of the amplitude of the parent peak.
</p>
<p>26.4  Collecting Data
</p>
<p>26.4.1  Exploratory Spectrum
</p>
<p>1. Before proceeding to collect final data on a sample, it is 
generally a good idea to collect an exploratory spectrum. 
This exploratory spectrum should be collected for suf-
ficiently long to ensure that all the elements (major, 
minor, and trace) present in specimen can be identified. 
This exploratory spectrum can also be used to determine 
how long an acquisition will be necessary to get the pre-
cision you desire for each element in the spectrum.
</p>
<p>2. Subject the exploratory spectrum to qualitative analysis 
using the vendor-supplied automatic peak identification 
tool but always follow with manual inspection of the 
suggested elemental identifications to determine validity. 
The elements identified will determine the standards 
that will be necessary for the analysis.
</p>
<p>3. If you suspect that an element may also be present but is 
obscured by another element, a standard should be col-
lected for that element too.
</p>
<p>4. It may be beneficial to perform a standardless analysis 
on the exploratory spectrum to get a rough idea of the 
composition of the unknown (Be sure that the manually 
confirmed element list, not the raw automatic peak iden-
tification list, is used for the standardless analysis.)

<p>26.4.2  Experiment Optimization
</p>
<p>Determining the peak fitting reference requirements and the 
optimal acquisition times can be a challenge. DTSA-II pro-
vides a tool to help. The user provides an estimate of the com-
position of the unknown (crude estimates are fine), the 
standards you are going to use and the desired measurement 
precision and the tool will tell you when references are 
required and suggest approximately how long to acquire each 
standard, reference and unknown spectrum.
</p>
<p>26.4.3  Selecting Standards
</p>
<p>1. Select a standard for each element that you believe is 
present in the unknown.
</p>
<p>2. In certain problem domains, you may be able to omit a 
standard if you calculate oxygen by assumed stoichiom-
etry or assume an element by difference from an analyti-
cal total of one.
</p>
<p>3. It&rsquo;s generally best to assume that you will measure every 
element and collect a standard for each. You can always 
change your mind later.
</p>
<p>4. Initially, it is probably best to select a simple standard 
(one for which no peak shape references are required)
</p>
<p>26.4.4  Reference Spectra
</p>
<p>References serve two purposes:
 1. To resolve interferences in multi-element standards
</p>
<p> 5 Example: In BaF
2
, the Ba M lines interfere with the F K 
</p>
<p>lines. To use BaF
2
 as a standard for Ba, two references 
</p>
<p>(e.g., BaCl
2
 for Ba and CaF
</p>
<p>2
 for F) are required to pro-
</p>
<p>vide clear, interference-free views of the Ba M-family 
peaks and the F K-family peaks in the range of energies 
in which the Ba M lines interfere with the F K lines.
</p>
<p> 2. To strip elements which are known to contribute to the 
unknown spectrum but are not really present in the 
material
</p>
<p> 5 Example: A reference to strip a thin conductive coat-
ing of Au, Pt, or C.
</p>
<p>26.4.5  Collecting Standards
</p>
<p>1. Since standards will typically contribute to many mea-
surements, it is generally a good idea to spend extra time 
to ensure that standards are of high quality.
</p>
<p>2. The total acquisition time necessary depends upon the 
measurement goals and can be determined by examin-
ing the intensity in an element&rsquo;s characteristic peaks. In 
particular, you should examine the characteristic peaks 
that will be used to perform the quantification. The 
background corrected peak integral should contain at 
least 10,000 counts for approximately 1 % precision or 
160,000 counts for 0.25 % precision.
</p>
<p>3. It is generally better to collect multiple shorter acquisi-
tion spectra from multiple points on the standard and 
build a single high-quality standard spectrum from the 
best of these. Collecting multiple spectra allows you to 
discern problems with individual spectra that may oth-
erwise go unnoticed.
</p>
<p>4. Collect N where N &gt; 2 spectra from various different 
points on the standard.
</p>
<p> 5 Measure and record the probe current before collect-
ing each spectrum and after the last.
</p>
<p> 5 Note any significant changes in probe current where 
&ldquo;significant&rdquo; is determined by the desired measure-
ment precision.
</p>
<p>5. Compare the N spectra but plotting them simultane-
ously using the same vertical scale for all. Examine care-
fully the intensity in the characteristic peak of choice. 
Discard any spectra which differ systematically by more 
than counting statistics. Sum the remaining spectra 
together to form a single spectrum.
</p>
<p>6. Ensure the following properties are assigned to the stan-
dard spectrum.
(i) Beam energy
(ii) Probe current
(iii) Live-time
(iv) Composition of the standard
</p>
<p>7. Save the standard to disk.
8. Repeat for each required standard.
</p>
<p>26.4.6  Collecting Peak-Fitting References
</p>
<p>References serve as examples of an element&rsquo;s characteristic 
peak shapes. The factors that make for a good reference are 
different from those that make a good standard.
 1. A good material for a reference need not be as carefully 
</p>
<p>mounted and prepared as a standard or unknown.
 2. Particles or rougher surfaces can serve as adequate refer-
</p>
<p>ence materials.
 3. You don&rsquo;t need to know the probe current or live-time.
 4. While it is generally a good idea to collect the reference 
</p>
<p>at the same beam energy (particularly for lower over-
voltages on the L and M lines), it is not always necessary.
</p>
<p> 5. References should be high count spectra but are less sus-
ceptible to count statistics than the standards. In general, 
a reference should have significantly more than 10,000 
counts in the element&rsquo;s useful characteristic peak to pro-
vide an adequate perspective of the peak shape.
</p>
<p> 6. Simple elemental standards can always be reused as ref-
erences.
</p>
<p> 7. Save the references to disk.
</p>
<p>26.4.7  Collecting Spectra 
From&nbsp;the&nbsp;Unknown
</p>
<p>1. Examine the exploratory spectrum to determine how 
long an acquisition time to use for the unknown
</p>
<p>26.4 &middot;  Collecting Data</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>468
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>2. Examine the intensity in the measured characteristic 
peak for each element in the unknown to make realistic 
precision goals for each element:
</p>
<p> 5 1 % or better precision is realistic for major elements 
</p>
<p>(C &gt; 0.1 mass fraction)
</p>
<p> Ȥ 1 % precision requires at least 10,000 counts in the 
unknown&rsquo;s quantified characteristic peak
</p>
<p> 5 3&ndash;1 % is realistic for minor elements (0.01 &le; C &le; 0.1 mass 
</p>
<p>fraction)
</p>
<p> Ȥ 3 % precision requires at least 1,000 counts in the 
unknown&rsquo;s quantified characteristic peak
</p>
<p>3. Each element is likely to require a different acquisition 
time. Select the longest.
</p>
<p>4. Collect multiple spectra from different positions on the 
unknown as you did with the standards, compare the 
unknown spectra looking for differences. If one or more 
spectra are different, try to identify the source of the dif-
ferences. The differences may reflect real inhomogene-
ities or they may represent measurement artifacts like 
surface contamination, roughness, voids, or probe insta-
bility.
</p>
<p>5. Collect an image with the spectrum so that if there is a 
problem with a particular spectrum, you can assess 
whether there may be a sample-related problem.
</p>
<p>6. You may reasonably eliminate (and potentially recollect) 
spectra that differ due to recognized measurement artifacts. 
However, unexpected differences may be important clues 
that the specimen is locally different in some unexpected 
manner that this difference comprises real information that 
you do not want to ignore. Reality on the micrometer-scale 
is often more complex than we expect.
</p>
<p>7. Identify the subset of the acquired unknown spectra that 
you are going to quantify. Ensure each spectrum from 
the unknown contains the following data items:
(i) Beam energy
(ii) Probe current
(iii) Live-time
</p>
<p>26.5  Data Analysis
</p>
<p>26.5.1  Organizing the&nbsp;Data
</p>
<p>By this point, you should have collected all the pieces of data 
you need to perform the quantification:
 1. Standard spectra&mdash;One high-quality standard for each 
</p>
<p>element in the unknown
 2. Reference spectra&mdash;For each standard with an interfer-
</p>
<p>ence and for each element to strip
 3. Unknown spectra
</p>
<p>26.5.2  Quantification
</p>
<p>DTSA-II quantification proceeds as follows:
 1. Select the unknown spectrum or group of spectra to 
</p>
<p>quantify.
 2. Select the standards. If a standard has two or more ele-
</p>
<p>ments, you will be asked which of the elements are to be 
considered for this analysis: for example, if FeS
</p>
<p>2
 is selected, 
</p>
<p>you will can select Fe and/or S.&nbsp;Only one standard can be 
selected per element. If an element present in the standard 
has already been selected, it will be grayed out.
</p>
<p> 3. Select the references. DTSA-II will inform you if a stan-
dard cannot serve as a reference due to a conflict from 
interfering peaks; for example, for BaF
</p>
<p>2
, the Ba M- family 
</p>
<p>and F K-peak mutually interfere. If a reference is needed 
that is different from the standard, then select the ele-
ment in dispute (which appears in red) from the list and 
select an appropriate spectrum to serve as a reference, 
for example, CaF
</p>
<p>2
 for F and BaCl
</p>
<p>2
 for Ba M-family.
</p>
<p> 4. DTSA-II will then execute and return a report with the 
k-ratios measured, the elemental concentrations calcu-
lated, the residual spectrum after peak fitting, and the 
uncertainty budget consisting of the uncertainties due to 
counting statistics of the unknown and standard, the 
atomic number correction, and the absorption correc-
tion.
</p>
<p>26.6  Quality Check
</p>
<p>26.6.1  Check the&nbsp;Residual Spectrum After 
Peak Fitting
</p>
<p>You aren&rsquo;t done until you&rsquo;ve checked for blunders, mistakes, and 
surprises. Two of the most common mistakes are missed ele-
ments and misidentified elements. Both of these mistakes can be 
identified using the residual spectrum. The residual spectrum is 
a derived spectrum computed from the unknown spectrum in 
which all the quantified characteristic peaks are removed.
 1. Missed element: One of the most common surprises is a 
</p>
<p>missed element. Sometimes, the element is hiding under 
the characteristic lines for another element. You won&rsquo;t 
know about the other element until you&rsquo;ve performed 
peak fitting for the intensity contributions from the ele-
ments that you already know about. A missed element 
will show up as a peak in the residual. If you have missed 
an element, you will need to add an appropriate standard 
for that element (and possibly a reference) and re-quan-
tify the data.
</p>
<p> Chapter 26 &middot; Energy Dispersive X-Ray Microanalysis Checklist</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26469
</p>
<p> 2. Misidentified element: Many characteristic peaks can 
be mistaken for another element. A peak may be at 
the correct energy for another element but the resid-
ual will reveal the mistake. The shape of peaks will be 
different and the residual will appear irregular and 
non-physical. Alternatively, there may be other peaks 
that remain in the residual unaccounted for by your 
initial choice of standards. To fix this problem you 
should replace the standard for the misidentified ele-
ment with one for the correct element and re-quantify 
the data.
</p>
<p>26.6.2  Check the&nbsp;Analytic Total
</p>
<p>The analytic total is the sum of the mass fractions measured 
for each element in the unknown. The analytic total should 
be close to unity if all elements have been recognized and 
included in quantitative calculations. When a typical mate-
rial is analyzed under typical conditions, the analytical total 
may reasonably vary 1 % or 2 % from unity due to measure-
ment uncertainties. Simple measurements based on energetic 
K peak transitions can be reliably measured to better than a 
percent. More complex measurements involving low energy 
X-rays (like carbides and oxides) are likely to have larger 
deviations. A deviation of more than a percent or two should 
inspire you to start asking questions.
 1. Have I missed an element?
</p>
<p> (i) Check the residual. Is there a peak that hasn&rsquo;t been 
quantified?
</p>
<p> (ii) Is it possible that there is an unmeasurable element 
like H, He, or Li in the unknown?
</p>
<p> 2. Is there a problem with the measurement process?
 (i) Is the sample preparation adequate?
 (ii) Is the sample tilted?
 (iii) Is the sample at the correct working distance?
 (iv) Is the probe current being measured accurately?
 (v) Did the probe current drift?
 (vi) Did the specimen charge?
</p>
<p>26.6.3  Intercompare the&nbsp;Measurements
</p>
<p>Whenever feasible you should make multiple measurements 
of each material. As part of the quality control process, you 
should compare these measurements.
 1. How do the measurements vary among themselves?
 2. How does the variance calculated from the measured 
</p>
<p>values compare with the estimated uncertainties (partic-
ularly the uncertainties due to precision)?
</p>
<p> 3. Do the measured variances suggest that the material is 
homogeneous or inhomogeneous?
</p>
<p> 4. Is there an outlier? Can you explain the outlier? Examine 
the SEM image of the region. Is there any obvious differ-
ence in the image compared to other areas? If there is no 
obvious reason for the outlier, does it suggest something 
about the sample or does it says something about the mea-
surement process? Can you reproduce the outlier by re-
measuring the spectrum at the same location?
</p>
<p> Report the&nbsp;Results
</p>
<p>&bull;  What to&nbsp;Report
</p>
<p>The analytical report should be a concise description of what 
</p>
<p>request was made to the analyst, what analytical strategy was 
</p>
<p>developed, how the measurement was performed and the 
</p>
<p>results.
</p>
<p>&bull;  Analytical Procedure
</p>
<p>The analytical procedure should provide sufficient detail that 
</p>
<p>you or someone else with the correct instrumentation could 
</p>
<p>replicate the measurement.
</p>
<p> 1. Scanning electron microscope
</p>
<p>5 Manufacturer and model
</p>
<p>5 Beam energy
</p>
<p>5 Nominal probe current

<p> 2. X-ray detector

<p>5 Configuration settings
</p>
<p> 3. Other aspects
</p>
<p>5 Picoammeter

<p>5 Software
</p>
<p> 4. Standards

<p> 6. Unknown
</p>
<p>5 Identity, sample preparation, coating
</p>
<p> 7. How the locations for analysis were selected. Was it based 
</p>
<p>on the customer&rsquo;s directions or if the analyst selected the 
</p>
<p>locations, what criteria were used?
</p>
<p>&bull;  Results
</p>
<p>Each spectrum should be reported independently. For multi-
</p>
<p>ple spectra, tabular form works well.
</p>
<p> 1. Reporting the elemental data
</p>
<p>5 It is generally best to report the non-normalized 
</p>
<p>mass- fraction unless there is precedent for using an 
</p>
<p>alternative format. It is only acceptable to report the 
</p>
<p>normalized mass- fraction if the analytical total is also 
</p>
<p>reported.
</p>
<p> 2. If you report in oxide fraction or atom fraction be sure to 
</p>
<p>include the analytical total since the act of converting 
</p>
<p>26.6 &middot;   Quality Check</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>470
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>from mass concentration (weight fraction) to atomic frac-
</p>
<p>tion or oxide fraction includes normalization.
</p>
<p> 3. DTSA-II provides an estimate of the measurement uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty for each element. The estimate should make clear 
</p>
<p>which factors were considered and whether the estimate 
</p>
<p>should be considered an estimate of accuracy or just an esti-
</p>
<p>mate of precision. A measurement without an uncertainty 
</p>
<p>estimate is open to misuse. The client may assume that the 
</p>
<p>result is more accurate than it really is and draw conclusions 
</p>
<p>that cannot be justified by the data. Alternatively, the client 
</p>
<p>may not trust the data or may assume that it is less accurate 
</p>
<p>than it is and fail to draw conclusions that are justified. Either 
</p>
<p>way, data presented without uncertainties is of limited utility.
</p>
<p> 4. If the spectra represent a nominally homogeneous 
</p>
<p>region (or one you suspect to be), add descriptive statis-
</p>
<p>tics (mean, standard deviation) summarizing the 
</p>
<p> variation between locations for each element. Compare 
</p>
<p>this value with the uncertainty estimate for a single mea-
</p>
<p>surement to detect heterogeneity.
</p>
<p>&bull;  Conclusions
</p>
<p>Conclusions should be pithy. You should be very careful only 
</p>
<p>to&nbsp; report that which is directly supported by the measure-
</p>
<p>ment results. In other words, stick to the facts and avoid con-
</p>
<p>jecture. Don&rsquo;t answer questions that go beyond the data and 
</p>
<p>your personal expertise.

<p>27.1  Case Study: Characterization of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Hard- 
Facing Alloy Bearing Surface
</p>
<p>Background: As part of a study into the in-service failure of the 
bearing surface of a large water pump, characterization was 
requested of the hard-facing alloy, which was observed to have 
separated from the stainless steel substrate, causing the failure.
</p>
<p>This problem illustrates the critical importance of careful 
specimen preparation of a macroscopic object with centime-
ter dimensions to locate regions of microscopic interest with 
micrometer dimensions. Metallographic preparation pro-
duced a polished cross section of an intact portion of the 
hard-facing alloy layer as deposited onto the stainless steel 
base, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 27.1. SEM-EDS analysis with 
DTSA-II gave the results shown in . Fig.&nbsp;27.2 for the stain-
less steel base and at one location in the hard-facing alloy. 
EDS elemental mapping produced the images shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 27.3. The SEM- BSE image (. Fig.&nbsp; 27.1) revealed the 
presence of numerous voids that were predominantly located 
(white arrows) at the interface between the hard-facing alloy 
and the stainless steel substrate, with a smaller population of 
voids located within the hard-facing alloy (yellow arrows). 
The elemental maps (. Fig.&nbsp;27.3) revealed that the hard-fac-
ing alloy layer had a very complex microstructure with dis-
tinct heterogeneity. The voids were found to be closely 
associated with regions with that had elevated Cr, both near 
the hard-facing alloy-stainless steel interface and within the 
hard-facing alloy. These voids severely compromised the per-
formance of the bearing surface.
</p>
<p>Complex fine-grained regions were also observed within 
the hard-facing alloy, as shown in the elemental maps in 
</p>
<p>. Fig.&nbsp; 27.4 and the SEM-BSE image in . Fig.&nbsp; 27.5, which 
shows strong atomic number contrast. SEM-EDS analysis 
with DTSA-II gave the results presented in . Fig.&nbsp;27.5, which 
confirm the gray scale sequence as a function of composi-
tion, with the sharp rise in W (see table in . Fig.&nbsp;27.5) domi-
nating backscattering.
</p>
<p>The information provided by SEM-EDS enabled metal-
lurgists to modify the hard-facing alloy composition and 
deposition conditions to eliminate the void formation during 
deposition, producing satisfactory service behavior.

<p>27.2  Case Study: Aluminum Wire Failures 
in&nbsp;Residential Wiring
</p>
<p>Background: In the early 1970s, aluminum wire was used 
extensively as a substitute for more expensive copper wire in 
residential and commercial wiring, specifically for 110&nbsp; V 
electrical outlets that used steel screw compressive clamping 
of the wire against a brass or steel plate. The aluminum wire&ndash;
steel screw junctions were observed to fail catastrophically 
through a process of overheating, leading in extreme cases to 
initiation of structural fires (Meese and Beausoliel 1977; 
Rabinow 1978). . Figure&nbsp;27.6 shows an example of the dam-
age to the wire-screw junction and the surrounding plastic 
housing and wire insulation caused during an overheating 
event observed in a laboratory test. This failure was a puz-
zling occurrence, since aluminum is an excellent electrical 
conductor and was long used successfully in high voltage 
electrical transmission lines. Moreover, the vast majority of 
Al wire&ndash;screw connections provided proper service without 
overheating. However, those connections that did fail in ser-
vice often produced such catastrophic effects that the critical 
evidence of the initiation of the failure was destroyed. 
Capturing an event like that shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 27.6 required 
intensive laboratory studies in which thousands of junction 
boxes were tested and continuously monitored with thermal 
sensors until a failure initiated, which was then automatically 
interrupted to prevent complete destruction of the evidence.
</p>
<p>This problem illustrates the &ldquo;macro to micro&rdquo; sampling 
problem. The failure mechanism was eventually discovered 
by SEM/EDS characterization to have a microscopic point of 
origin, but this microscopic failure origin with micrometer 
dimensions was hidden within a complex macroscopic struc-

(. Fig.&nbsp;27.8). As shown with SEM/BSE imaging and elemen-
tal mapping in . Fig.&nbsp;27.9, in this anomalous region the alu-
minum and iron had reacted to form two distinct Al-Fe 
zones (Newbury and Greenwald 1980; Newbury 1982). Fixed

<p>beam quantitative X-ray microanalysis with NIST DTSA II 
and pure element standards (analyses performed during a 
revisiting of the 1980 specimens) produced the results shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;27.10, where zone 1 is found to correspond closely

 have electrical resistivities of approximately 1 μΩ&ndash;m,

<p>similar to that of the alloy nichrome (1.1 μΩ&ndash;m), which is 
used for resistive heating elements and which is a factor of 38 
higher than pure Al and 10.3 higher than pure Fe. The forma-
tion of these intermetallic compounds at the screw-wire con-
tact was initiated when electrical arcing occurred because the 
connection became mechanically loose due to creep of the Al 
wire and the poor compliance (springiness) of the wire&ndash;
screw clamp. Once the local formation of the intermetallic 
compounds had been initiated by arcing followed by local 
welding of the Al wire and the steel screw, the increased resis-
tivity caused localized resistive heating that stimulated the 
interdiffusion of Al and Fe, leading to the further intermetal-
lic compound growth in a runaway positive feedback. 
Eventually this intermetallic compound zone expanded to 
dimensions of several hundred micrometers, as seen in

<p>27.3  Case Study: Characterizing 
the&nbsp;Microstructure of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Manganese 
Nodule
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manganese nodules&rdquo; are rock concretions that form on the 
deep sea floor through the action of microorganisms that 
precipitate solid chemical forms from metals dissolved in the 
water, often in close association with hydrothermal vents.
</p>
<p>The elemental composition of a polished cross section of a 
manganese nodule, shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 27.11, was examined by 
SEM/BSE and by SEM/EDS X-ray spectrum imaging elemental 
mapping. The SEM/BSE image in . Fig.&nbsp;27.12 reveals a complex 
layered microstructure that suggests non-uniform deposition 
of the precipitated minerals over time. This non- uniform depo-
sition is confirmed by the elemental maps for O, Mn, and Ni 
and color overlay shown in . Fig.&nbsp;27.13 and for the Mn, Fe, and 
Ni maps shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 27.14. Note the oxygen- rich areas 
(green) in . Fig.&nbsp;27.13. These regions correspond to silica and 
aluminosilicate grains within the manganese nodule, as revealed 
in . Fig.&nbsp;27.15. The composition measured with a fixed beam 
placed at the center of the field of view is listed in . Table&nbsp;27.1, 
showing the high abundance of Mn as a major constituent and 
the presence of other transition elements (e.g., Fe, Ni, and Cu) 
as minor constituents. . Figure&nbsp;27.16 shows the results of quan-
</p>
<p>titative processing of the XSI with the k-ratio/matrix correction 
protocol using DTSA-II.&nbsp; The resulting concentration maps 
have been encoded with the logarithmic three- band color 
scheme shown in . Fig.&nbsp;27.16, enabling quantitative compari-
son of the constituents, using NIST Lispix.
</p>
<p>Note that some features in the elemental maps are a result 
of artifacts. Thus, the cracks noted in the SEM/BSE of 
. Fig.&nbsp;27.11 are also seen in the O elemental map, but not in 
the Mn or Ni maps. The origin of this artifact is the difference 
in the photon energies of these elements. The O K-shell X-ray

<p>28.1  Origin
</p>
<p>Cathodoluminescence (CL) is the emission of low energy 
photons in the range from approximately 1&nbsp; eV to 5&nbsp; eV 
(infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light) as a result of inelas-
tic scattering of the high energy beam electrons (. Fig.&nbsp;28.1). 
Materials that can emit such photons are insulators or semi-
conductors which have an electronic structure with a filled 
valence band of allowed energy states that is separated by a 
gap of disallowed energy states from the empty conduction 
band, as shown schematically in . Fig.&nbsp;28.2a. Inelastic scat-
tering of the beam electron can transfer energy to a weakly 
bound valence electron promoting it to the empty conduc-
tion band, leaving a positively charged &ldquo;hole&rdquo; in the con-
duction band. When a free electron and a positive hole are 
attracted and recombine, the energy difference is expressed 
as a photon, as illustrated in . Fig.&nbsp;28.2b. Because the pos-
sible energy transitions and the resulting photon emission 
are defined by the intrinsic properties of a high purity mate-
rial, such as the band-gap energy but also including energy 
levels that result from physical defects such as lattice vacan-
cies, rather than by the influence of impurity atoms, this 
type of CL is referred to as &ldquo;intrinsic CL emission.&rdquo; Since 
the valence electron promoted to the conduction band can 
receive a range of possible kinetic energies depending on 
the details of the initial scattering, the photons emitted dur-
ing free electron&ndash;hole recombination can have a range of 
energies, resulting in broad band CL photon emission. 
Because of the great mismatch in the velocity of the high 
energy (keV) beam electron and the low energy (eV) 
valence electron, this is not an efficient process and in gen-
eral CL emission is very weak. The ionization cross section 
is maximized for electrons with three to five times the bind-
ing energy of the valence electrons, so that most efficient 
energy transfer to initiate CL emission occurs from the 
more energetic slow SE (&gt;10&nbsp;eV) and the fast SE (hundreds 
of eV) also created by inelastic scattering of the primary 
electron.
</p>
<p>In more complex materials that are modified by impuri-
ties, the presence of impurity atoms in the host crystal lattice 
can create sharply defined energy levels within the band gap 
to which valence electrons can be scattered, as illustrated in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 28.3. The subsequent electron&ndash;hole transitions that 
involve these well-defined energy states create a photon or 
series of photons with a sharply defined energy or series of 
energies (&ldquo;extrinsic CL emission&rdquo;). This sharp line spectrum 
may be superimposed on a broad range intrinsic spectrum 
which can still occur.

<p>28.2  Measuring Cathodoluminescence
</p>
<p>Some materials such as the mineral benitoite and the com-
pound ZnS produce such strong CL that the emitted light can 
be readily observed by the unaided eye, as shown in 
. Figs.&nbsp;28.4 and 28.5. However, in general the CL phenome-
non is weak, requiring the use of an efficient optical collec-
tion scheme for successful measurement.
</p>
<p>28.2.1  Collection of&nbsp;CL
</p>
<p>To maximize photon collection, the specimen can be sur-
rounded by a mirror configured to collect a solid angle of 
nearly 2π sr. An example shown in . Fig.&nbsp;28.6 of an ellipsoidal 
mirror in which the specimen is placed at one mirror focus, 
where an aperture permits the electron beam to reach the 
specimen, and the collector, typically a fiber optic, is placed 
at the other focus. For the examples of direct observation of 
CL shown in . Figs.&nbsp;28.4 and 28.5, the CL emission was col-
lected through the high collection angle optical microscope 
integrated into an electron optical column (specifically, an 
electron probe microanalyzer configuration with wavelength 
dispersive spectrometry, EPMA/WDS, in which the optical 
microscope serves as the critical positioning aid for the WDS 
optimization).
</p>
<p>28.2.2  Detection of&nbsp;CL
</p>
<p>The photomultiplier (PM) is a useful detector for CL because 
of its sensitivity to photons in the energy range of interest, its

<p>its operation as a high gain (gain ~106), low noise amplifier. 
The choice of the photocathode material, which converts the 
photons to low energy electrons at the first stage of the elec-
tron cascade, determines the spectral response, quantum effi-
ciency, and sensitivity as a function of photon energy, typically 
showing a strong dependence as a function of wavelength. By 
choosing different photocathodes, PMs can be optimized for 
efficiently detecting different photon energies. . Figure&nbsp;28.7 
illustrates a dispersive system in which the CL is scattered by 
a grating onto an array of PMs optimized to detect the differ-
ent photon energies. Such a parallel detection strategy is 
critical to optimize measurements from weakly emitting sys-
tems, as well as to study systems with complex emission.

energy response photomultiplier to detect CL photons

<p> Carbonado Diamond
</p>
<p>Carbonado is a rare variety of black diamond found in porous 
aggregates of fine polycrystals.
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;28.8 shows CL imaging (using RGB filters) of a 
carbonado sample where the polycrystalline diamonds inter-
acted with trace uranium during the Precambrian. The 
resulting MeV radiation damage is evident as metamict halos 
leaving the defects in the diamond structure (Magee et&nbsp; al. 
2016). These haloes were not evident in SEM SE or BSE 
images or in elemental maps, indicating the sensitivity of CL 
emission to the presence of lattice defects that do not other-
wise significantly affect the electron beam specimen interac-
tion.

lines where they intersect the face(s) of the pyramid and 
(ii) regions with a high concentration of point defects or 
impurities. CL spectrum imaging was used to map the 
near band edge emission of GaN as a 3D datacube where a 
full CL spectrum (1D) was acquired at every pixel in the 
region of interest (2D). Changes in the near band edge

<p> Lead-Acid Battery Plate Reactions
</p>
<p>It is possible to detect relatively strong CL signals with modi-
fied BSE detectors, as most of these solid state detectors are 
very sensitive to light. The challenge is to exclude BSE from 
the detected signal. The easiest way to do this is to coat a glass 
coverslip with a conductive transparent material like indium 
tin oxide (ITO). The glass cover slip prevents the electrons 
from interacting with the solid state detector and the con-
ductive transparent coating prevents charging while allowing 
the CL signal to reach the detector.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that some of the low vacuum or 
variable pressure SEMs that are commercially available use 
the CL light generated by the interaction of the secondary 
electrons with the gas in the chamber to produce a signal 
during variable pressure operation. One can use the same 
detector system, which consists of a glass light guide located 
near the sample that is coupled to a photomultiplier, for 
direct detection of CL emission. This type of detector is sen-
sitive to low levels of light and thus when used in high vac-
uum mode can be a very simple but effective CL detector.
</p>
<p>During the charging and discharging of lead acid battery 
plates, a variety of lead containing phases can form on the 
surface of the lead plate. Two important phases are lead sul-
fide (PbS) and lead sulfate (PbSO
</p>
<p>4
). Note that these com-
</p>
<p>pounds are similar in backscattering making it difficult to 
determine PbS from PbSO
</p>
<p>4
 in images. . Figure&nbsp;28.11a shows 
</p>
<p>a secondary electron image of the surface of a lead plate after 
it has been exposed to conditions that may occur in a lead-
acid battery. Numerous euhedral crystals were observed on 
the surface of the lead plate. The EDS spectra indicated Pb 
and S as the major constituents and possibly O.&nbsp;Oxygen can 
be detected in the EDS spectrum of PbSO
</p>
<p>4
 from an ideal flat 
</p>
<p>specimen, as shown in the DTSA-II simulation in 
. Fig.&nbsp;28.11c, but because of the high absorption from Pb, the 
time requirement for mapping O to locate PbSO
</p>
<p>4
 becomes 
</p>
<p>prohibitive. Moreover, given the complex topography of the 
sample shown in . Fig.&nbsp;28.11a, mapping oxygen is likely to be 
badly compromised by strong X-ray absorption artifacts 
from the topography. CL can be of great use in this system as 
PbS does not exhibit CL while PbSO
</p>
<p>4
 strongly exhibits CL, 
</p>
<p>enabling these compounds to be rapidly distinguished. In 
order to determine the likely compound, a simple CL system 
consisting of a light guide attached to a photomultiplier tube 
was used. . Figure&nbsp; 28.11b is an image obtained using this 
simple CL detector. Note that the euhedral crystals strongly 
exhibit CL, and this clearly indicates that these crystals are 
most likely PbSO

<p>While amorphous substances such as glass are encountered 
both in natural and artificial materials, most inorganic mate-
rials are found to be crystalline on some scale, ranging from 
sub-nanometer to centimeter or larger. A crystal consists of a 
regular arrangement of atoms, the so-called &ldquo;unit cell,&rdquo; which 
is repeated in a two- or three-dimensional pattern. In the pre-
vious discussion of electron beam&ndash;specimen interactions, the 
crystal structure of the target was not considered as a variable 
in the electron range equation or in the Monte Carlo electron 
trajectory simulation. To a first order, the crystal structure 
does not have a strong effect on the electron&ndash;specimen inter-
actions. However, through the phenomenon of channeling of 
charged particles through the crystal lattice, crystal orienta-
tion can cause small perturbations in the total electron back-
scattering coefficient that can be utilized to image 
crystallographic microstructure through the mechanism des-
ignated &ldquo;electron channeling contrast,&rdquo; also referred to as 
&ldquo;orientation contrast&rdquo; (Newbury et&nbsp;al. 1986). The characteris-
tics of a crystal (e.g., interplanar angles and spacings) and its 
relative orientation can be determined through diffraction of 
the high-energy backscattered electrons (BSE) to form &ldquo;elec-
tron backscatter diffraction patterns (EBSD).
</p>
<p>29.1  Imaging Crystalline Materials 
with&nbsp;Electron Channeling Contrast
</p>
<p>29.1.1  Single Crystals
</p>
<p>The regular arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids can 
influence the backscattering of electrons because of the regu-
lar three-dimensional variations in atomic density in the 
crystal compared to those same atoms placed in the near 
random three-dimensional distribution of an amorphous 
solid. If a well-collimated (i.e., highly parallel) electron beam 
is directed at a crystal array of atoms along a series of differ-
ent directions, the density of atoms that the beam encounters 
will vary with the crystal orientation, as shown in the simple 
schematic of . Fig.&nbsp;29.1. A sense of this effect can be obtained 
by manual manipulation of a macroscopic, three- dimensional 
ball-and-stick model of a crystal. For certain orientations of 
the model, the observer can see through the &ldquo;atoms&rdquo; along 
the open gaps between the planes in the model. In a real solid, 
the atoms are tightly packed, limited in their approach by the 
repulsive interaction of their atomic shells. The &ldquo;channels&rdquo; in 
reality are regions of the crystal where the atomic packing 
creates lower charge density with which the beam electrons 
will interact more weakly. When the beam is aligned with 
the channels, a small fraction of the beam electrons penetrate 
more deeply into the crystal before beginning to scatter. For 
beam electrons that start scattering deeper in the crystal, the 
probability that they will return to the surface as backscat-
tered electrons is reduced compared to the amorphous target 
case, and so the measured backscatter coefficient is lowered 
compared to the average value from the amorphous target. 
</p>
<p>For other crystal orientations where denser atom packing is 
found, the beam electrons begin to scatter immediately at the 
surface, increasing the backscatter coefficient relative to the 
amorphous target case. As seen in the Monte Carlo simula-
tion of an amorphous target, the elastic scattering of beam 
electrons rapidly randomizes their trajectories out of their 
initially well-collimated condition, reducing and eventually 
eliminating sensitivity to channeling in the crystal. For a bulk 
target, the modulation of the backscatter coefficient between 
the maximum and minimum channeling case is small, typi-
cally only about a 2&ndash;5 % difference. Nevertheless, this crys-
tallographic or electron channeling contrast can be used to 
form SEM images that contain information about the impor-
tant class of crystalline materials.
</p>
<p>To determine the likelihood of electron channeling, the 
properties of the electron beam (i.e., its energy, E, or equiva-
lently, wavelength, λ) are related to the critical crystal prop-
erty, namely the spacing of the atomic planes, d, through the 
Bragg diffraction relation:
</p>
<p>n = dl q2 sin
B  
</p>
<p>(29.1)
</p>
<p>where n is the integer order of diffraction (n = 1, 2, 3, etc.). 
Equation&nbsp;29.1 defines a special beam incidence angle relative 
to a particular set of the crystal planes with spacing d 
(referred to as the &ldquo;Bragg angle,&rdquo; θ
</p>
<p>B
) at which the channeling 
</p>
<p>condition changes sharply from weak to strong as the beam 
incidence angle increases relative to that particular set of 
crystal planes. Since a real crystal contains many different 
possible sets of atom planes, the degree of channeling 
</p>
<p>       . Fig. 29.1 Schematic illustration of the channeling effect: the atomic 
</p>
<p>area density that the beam encounters depends on its orientation rela-
</p>

</p>
<p>encountered for an arbitrary orientation of the beam to the 
crystal is actually the sum of the contributions of many 
planes. Generally, these contributions tend to cancel giving 
the amorphous average backscattering except when the 
Bragg condition for a certain set of planes dominates the mix, 
giving rise to a sharp change in the channeling condition. 
What is the magnitude of Bragg angles for typical SEM beam 
and target conditions? Consider an incident beam of E
</p>
<p>0 =
 
</p>
<p>15&nbsp;keV, where the electron wavelength, λ
e
 is given by the de 
</p>
<p>Broglie equation:
</p>
<p>l
e
=h/p
</p>
<p> 
(29.2a)
</p>
<p>where h is Planck&rsquo;s constant and p is the momentum (m
0
v). In 
</p>
<p>terms of beam energy, the wavelength is given by
</p>
<p>l
e
</p>
<p>0.5 0.5
</p>
<p>nm 1.226 1+0.979E 6( ) ( )&eacute;&euml; &ugrave;&ucirc;= / E E-  
(29.2b)
</p>
<p>where E is expressed in eV (Hirsch et&nbsp;al. 1965).
At 15&nbsp;keV, λ
</p>
<p>e
 = 0.00994&nbsp;nm. If this 15&nbsp;keV-beam is directed 
</p>
<p>at a crystal of silicon, which has a diamond-cubic crystal lat-
tice with a fundamental cube dimension of a = 0.543&nbsp;nm, the 
series of possible &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; Bragg angles (expressed in the 
&ldquo;Miller indices&rdquo; [hkl] which designate the crystal planes) is 
given in . Table&nbsp;29.1.
</p>
<p>We can directly image the effects of crystallographic 
channeling on the total backscattered electron intensity for 
the special case of a large single crystal viewed with a large 
scanned area (i.e., low magnification). As shown schemati-
cally in . Fig.&nbsp;29.2, the act of image scanning not only moves 
the beam laterally in x- and y-directions, but at each beam 
position the angle of the beam relative to the surface normal 
changes. For a 10-mm working distance from the scan rock-
ing point, a scan excursion of 2&nbsp;mm in width causes the beam 
incidence angle to change by &plusmn;12&deg; across the field. As seen in 
. Table&nbsp;29.1, the allowed Bragg angles for a 15-keV electron 
beam striking Si have values of a fraction of a degree to a few 
degrees, so that a scan angle of &plusmn;12&deg; will certainly cause the 
beam to pass through the Bragg condition for at least some of 
</p>
<p>the crystal planes. A large area image created at E
0
 = 15&nbsp;keV 
</p>
<p>by scanning a flat, topographically featureless silicon crys-
tal&mdash;prepared with the surface nearly parallel to the (001) 
plane&mdash;is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;29.3. The image consists of a pat-
tern of bands, each running parallel to a particular crystal 
plane, creating a so-called electron channeling pattern 
(Coates 1967). The channeling effect appears as this series of 
prominent bands that span the crystal because the intersec-
tion of the crystal planes with the surface defines a linear 
trace, and the Bragg condition is satisfied along lines parallel 
to this trace where the scan angle relative to the planes equals 
the Bragg angle, &plusmn;θ
</p>
<p>B
. &ldquo;Higher order&rdquo; Bragg angles (n = 2, 3, 4, 
</p>
<p>etc., with the specific integers that appear depending on 
&ldquo;allowed reflections&rdquo;) are satisfied as a series of progressively 
fainter lines parallel to the central bands, which can be seen 
in . Fig.&nbsp;29.3 (b) for the family of {220} type bands. Note that 
it is appropriate to apply both a dimensional marker and an 
angular marker to this image. When the scanned area is 
decreased, that is, the magnification is increased, the range of 
the angular scan is reduced, and consequently, the bands on 
the display appear to widen and the angular extent of the 
electron channeling pattern decreases, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;29.4a, b. If the magnification is made high enough and 
the angular range is sufficiently reduced, the beam will scan 
through such a small angle that the observer will see the cen-
ter of the pattern swell to eventually fill the image with a 
single gray level. Effectively, the crystal presents a single 
atomic density that restricts the channeling effect to a single 
intensity value.

<p>rolling, extrusion, forging, etc., and subsequent thermal 
treatment result further modify the crystalline microstruc-
ture, resulting in grain sizes ranging from centimeters to 
nanometers depending on composition and thermome-
chanical history and often inducing &ldquo;preferred orienta-
tions&rdquo; where certain crystal directions will align among a 
subset of the grains. What happens to the channeling con-
trast image as the grain size is reduced from the large single 
crystal case? . Fig.&nbsp; 29.5 shows a coarse polycrystal with 
grain dimensions in the millimeter range, again viewed 
</p>
<p>with a large scan field at low magnification. The scan angle 
is nearly the same as for . Fig.&nbsp; 29.3, but the presence of 
boundaries between the crystals (&ldquo;grain boundaries&rdquo;) inter-
rupts the channeling pattern so that we can no longer 
observe enough of the pattern to determine the orientation. 
We can, however, detect the grains themselves because of 
the pattern discontinuities. In . Fig.&nbsp;29.6, the grain size has 
been further reduced, so that the magnification must be 
increased so that the angular change across each grain is 
now very small. The grains in this 75Fe-25Ni alloy are seen 
with nearly uniform shades of gray because each grain ori-
entation effectively provides an easy, intermediate, or hard 
orientation for channeling resulting in low, intermediate, or 
high BSE emission. How far down in scale can crystalline 
features be observed? With special high resolution SEMs 
and energy selecting BSE detectors, the angular distortions 
introduced by the strain fields of individual crystal disloca-
tions have been seen (Morin et&nbsp;al. 1979; Kamaladasa and 
Picard 2010).
</p>
<p>Finally, the long-range effects of plastic deformation, 
which introduces defects and residual stress patterns into 
ductile metals, can be directly observed in channeling con-
trast images. . Figure&nbsp; 29.7 shows the channeling contrast 
from the damaged area around a large diamond stylus hard-
ness indent in the same 75Fe-25Ni alloy specimen shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;29.6. A similar effect around a hardness indentation in 
polycrystalline nickel is shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 29.8, revealing the 
extent of plastic deformation around the indent.

<p>29.1.3  Conditions for&nbsp;Detecting Electron 
Channeling Contrast
</p>
<p> Specimen Preparation
</p>
<p>Channeling contrast effects are created in a shallow near- 
surface layer that is 10&ndash;100&nbsp;nm in depth, depending on the 
incident beam energy and the material, where the incident 
beam has not yet undergone sufficient elastic scatter to 
destroy the initial beam collimation. Thus, the condition of 
the sample surface is of extreme importance for a successful 
channeling contrast measurement. The low level of channel-
ing contrast, 2&ndash;5 %, also requires eliminating other compet-
ing sources of contrast, especially surface topography. Thus, a 
typical sample preparation will involve grinding and polish-
ing to achieve a flat, topography-free surface. However, the 
inevitable surface damage layer produced in many materials, 
especially metals, by mechanical abrasion, including the 
&ldquo;Beilby layer&rdquo; that remains after the final polishing with the 
finest scale abrasives, must be removed by chemical or elec-
trochemical polishing or low energy ion beam sputtering. 
(Note that high energy ion sputtering can produce sub- 
surface damage that can destroy electron channeling 
contrast.)
</p>
<p> Instrument Conditions
</p>
<p>Detecting channeling effects that produce weak contrast in 
the range 2&ndash;5 % in an SEM image requires careful choice of 
operating conditions. The low contrast creates a requirement 
for a high threshold current, so that typically a beam current 
of 10&nbsp;nA or more is needed when scanning at rapid frame 
rates to find features of interest. After such features have been 
located, a smaller beam diameter can be used to improve 
resolution at the inevitable cost of a lower beam current, 
which then requires a longer frame time to maintain contrast 
</p>
<p>visibility. Because a small convergence angle is also desirable 
to maximize channeling contrast, a high electron source 
brightness is important to maximize the beam current into a 
focused beam of useful size. A high beam energy in the range 
from 10&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;keV is desirable both to increase source bright-
ness and to create high energy BSEs for efficient detection. 
Channeling contrast is carried by the high energy fraction of 
the backscattered electrons, and to maximize that signal, a 
large solid angle BSE detector (solid state or passive scintilla-
tor) is the best choice with the specimen set normal to the 
beam. The positively biased Everhart&ndash;Thornley (E&ndash;T) detec-
tor, with its high efficiency for BSEs through capture of the 
SE
</p>
<p>2
 and SE
</p>
<p>3
 signals, is also satisfactory. Because of the weak 
</p>
<p>contrast, the live image display must be enhanced by careful 
adjustment of the &ldquo;black level&rdquo; and amplifier settings to 
spread the channeling contrast over the full black-to-white 
range of the final display to render channeling contrast visi-
ble. Post-collection image processing by various tools, e.g., 
CLAHE in ImageJ-Fiji, can be very effective at recovering 
fine scale details.
</p>
<p>Crystallographic contrast by electron channeling pro-
vides images of the crystallographic microstructure of 
materials. For many applications in materials science, it is 
also important to measure the actual orientation of the 
microstructure on a local basis with high spatial resolu-
tion of 1 micrometer laterally or even finer. The technique 
of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns pro-
vides the ideal complement to channeling contrast 
microscopy.
</p>
<p>29.2  Electron Backscatter Diffraction 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Scanning Electron Microscope
</p>
<p>An understanding of the crystallography of a material is 
required to fully describe the structure property relation-
ships that control a material&rsquo;s physical properties. By linking 
the microstructure to the crystallography of the sample, a full 
picture of the sample can be developed. The development of 
electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) equipment and 
its placement in commercial tools for phase identification 
and orientation determination has provided new insights 
into microstructure, crystallography and materials physical 
properties.
</p>
<p>EBSD in the SEM has been developed for two different 
purposes. The oldest application of EBSD is for the mea-
surement of texture on a grain by grain basis. Texture deter-
mined in this way is called the microtexture of the sample 
(Randle 2013). An example of this is . Fig.&nbsp;29.9, where the 
point-by- point orientation of an assembly of ZnO crystals is 
shown where the color coding indicates the orientation of 
the crystal. The other use of EBSD is for the identification or 
discrimination of micrometer or sub-micrometer crystal-
line phases (Michael 2000; Dingley and Wright 2009). 
. Figure&nbsp;29.10 is an example of this, showing a dual-phase 
steel with both ferrite (body-centered cubic) and austenite 
(face-centered cubic) present. EBSD can easily discriminate

</p>
<p>between these two crystal structures. Both applications add 
an important new tool to the SEM.&nbsp;The SEM now has the 
capability to study the morphology of a sample through 
either secondary or backscattered electron imaging, the 
</p>
<p>chemistry through energy dispersive spectrometry and the 
crystallography of the sample by electron channeling con-
trast imaging and EBSD.&nbsp; EBSD techniques have recently 
been developed that allow both the elastic and plastic strains 
present in a microstructure to be determined and this has 
been called high resolution EBSD or HREBSD.&nbsp;A more use-
ful description would be high angular resolution EBSD.&nbsp;This 
technique is beyond the scope of this chapter (Wilkinson 
et&nbsp;al. 2006).
</p>
<p>Microtexture is a term that means a population of indi-
vidual orientations that are usually related to some feature of 
the sample microstructure. A simple example of this is the 
relationship of the individual grain size to grain orientation. 
The concept of microtexture may also be extended to include 
the misorientation between grains, often termed the meso-
texture. It is now possible using EBSD to collect and analyze 
thousands of orientations per minute, thus allowing excellent 
statistics in various distributions. The ability to link texture 
and microstructure has enabled significant progress in the 
understanding of recrystallization, grain boundary structure 
and properties, grain growth and many other important 
physical phenomena.
</p>
<p>The identification of phases in the SEM has usually been 
obtained by determining the composition of the phase and 
then inferring the identity of the phase. This technique is 
subject to the inherent inaccuracies in quantitative analysis 
in the SEM using EDS or WDS.&nbsp;In addition, this technique is 
not useful when one is attempting to identify a phase that has 
multiple crystal structures, but only one composition. A 
good example of this concern is TiO
</p>
<p>2
, with three different 
</p>
<p>crystal structures. Another important technological problem 
is the identification of austenite in ferrite in engineering 
steels. Austenite has a face centered cubic crystal structure 
and ferrite is body centered cubic and both phases may have 
very similar chemistries.
</p>
<p>Improved resolution for EBSD has been achieved by uti-
lizing thin samples that allow the transmission and diffrac-
tion of electrons using accelerating voltages (20&ndash;30&nbsp; kV) 
achievable in the SEM.&nbsp; The patterns generated in this way 
have very similar characteristics to EBSD but are formed in 
transmission mode and thus, due to the thin sample, have 
much improved spatial resolution as compared to EBSD per-
formed on bulk samples. Transmission Kikuchi diffraction 
(TKD) allows the microtexture of ultrafine grained crystal-
line materials to be studied (Keller and Geiss 2012; Trimby 
2012).
</p>
<p>In order to best use EBSD, it is helpful if the reader has 
some knowledge of crystallography and how crystallography 
is represented. There are a number of excellent books on this 
subject (McKie and McKie 1986; Rousseau 1998). This mod-
ule will first describe the origin of the EBSD pattern in the 
SEM.&nbsp;The detectors or cameras used to detect EBSD patterns 
will be described. As sample preparation is critical to the suc-
cess of an EBSD investigation, it is important to understand 
the methods needed to produce samples of appropriate qual-
ity. Finally, details of the actual experiment and the resulting 
output will be discussed.

</p>
<p>29.2.1  Origin of&nbsp;EBSD Patterns
</p>
<p>EBSD patterns are obtained in the SEM by illuminating a 
highly tilted specimen with a stationary electron beam. The 
beam electrons interact with the sample and are initially 
inelastically scattered. There are two current methods that 
are employed. The first method (conventional EBSD) uses 
the sample in a mode where backscattered electrons are 
detected (i.e., from a bulk sample). The second method 
(often termed TKD or transmission-EBSD although the use 
of the latter implies the impossibility of simultaneous trans-
mission and backscattering of the electrons) relies on a very 
thin sample and the patterns are then formed by the trans-
mitted electrons. In the case of the bulk sample and back-
scattered electron detection, the sample is held at a steep 
angle with respect to the electron beam. When a thin sample 
is used for TKD, the sample does not need to be tilted at 
such a high angle, and in fact the electron beam may be used 
to illuminate a sample which is not tilted. In either case, 
backscatter or transmission, some of these inelastically scat-
tered electrons that have lost little of their original energy 
satisfy the diffraction condition with the crystalline planes 
within the sample. When this interaction happens near the 
surface of the sample these electrons escape and form the 
EBSD pattern that is observed. These backscattered elec-
trons appear to originate from a virtual point below the sur-
face of the specimen. These types of patterns were first 
described by Kikuchi and are often referred to as Kikuchi 
patterns (Randle 2013). Some of the backscattered electrons 
satisfy the Bragg conditions for diffraction (+θ and &minus;θ) and 
are diffracted into cones of intensity with a semi-angle of 
(90-θ), with the cone axis normal to the diffracting plane. As 
shown by the Bragg Eq. (29.1), and . Table&nbsp;29.1, the short 
wavelength of the electron (at typical accelerating voltages 
of 10&ndash;30&nbsp;kV used in the SEM) results in a small Bragg angle 
of less than 2&deg;. Each plane yields two cones of intensity. The 
cones are quite flat and when they intercept the imaging 
plane they are imaged as two nearly straight lines separated 
by an angle of twice the Bragg angle. An alternative but 
equivalent description is the single event model. In this 
model, it is argued that the inelastic and elastic scattering 
events are intimately related and may be thought of as one 
event. In this case the electron channels out of the sample 
and forms the EBSD pattern (Winkelmann 2009; Randle 
2013). . Figure&nbsp;29.11 are two examples of an EBSD patterns 
collected from the mineral hematite at 5&nbsp;kV and 40&nbsp;kV.&nbsp;Note 
that the Kikuchi bands appear as nearly straight lines. The 
effect of the accelerating voltage is clearly seen. As the accel-
erating voltage is increased the Bragg angle decreases result-
ing in more narrowly spaced Kikuchi bands in the patterns. 
It is also important to note that the patterns are fixed with 
respect to the crystal orientation and so the positions of the 
line traces in the patterns have not moved. Fortunately we 
need not understand the exact physics of EBSD pattern for-
mation in order to use these patterns for crystallographic 
analysis.
</p>
<p>EBSD patterns consist of what appear to be nearly straight 
bands (they are actually conic sections) which may have 
bright or dark centers with respect to the rest of the pattern. 
These straight bands are the Kikuchi lines discussed previ-
ously. The Kikuchi bands intersect in many locations and 
these are called zone axes which are actual crystallographic 
directions within the unit cell of the crystal. The angles 
between the Kikuchi bands and the angles between the zone 
axes are specific for a given crystal structure. These features 
can be seen in . Fig.&nbsp;29.11b where the Kikuchi bands and the

</p>
<p>zone axes are clearly visible. In high quality patterns as shown 
in . Fig.&nbsp;29.11, there are many other features that are visible 
and may be used to understand the unit cell from which the 
pattern was collected.
</p>
<p>29.2.2  Cameras for&nbsp;EBSD Pattern Detection
</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to collect EBSD patterns in the SEM.&nbsp;The 
earliest EBSD images were collected by directly exposing 
photographic emulsions inside the specimen chamber of the 
SEM.&nbsp;As discussed previously, EBSD patterns are obtained 
from bulk samples by illuminating a highly tilted surface 
with the electron beam and then collecting the patterns on a 
position sensitive detector, sometimes referred to as a cam-
era, that is 1&ndash;2&nbsp;cm from the tilted sample surface. Generally 
the detector surface is located normal to the sample tilt axis 
so that tilting of the sample is easily achieved but the detec-
tor may also be tilted a few tens of degrees away from the 
horizontal position. The first electronic capture of EBSD pat-
terns utilized low-light video rate cameras that produced 
useable but somewhat noisy images requiring the use of very 
high beam currents in the SEM.&nbsp;Current EBSD cameras con-
sist of a fluorescent screen, either circular or rectangular, 
that is about 2&nbsp;cm in diameter if circular or 2&nbsp;cm on a side if 
square or rectangular formats are utilized. The screen is 
coated with a thin Al coating to avoid charging and to 
exclude light. The fluorescent screen is kept thin so that it 
can be imaged from the opposite side using either a fiber 
optic bundle or a lens to transfer the image on the phosphor 
to a charge coupled device (CCD) or a CMOS type solid 
state imager. Camera designs strive to minimize the loss of 
light from the fluorescent screen to increase the speed at 
which patterns can be collected or to increase the quality of 
the detected patterns. The transfer optics must also be 
designed to minimize any optical distortions to the collected 
patterns (Schwarzer et&nbsp;al. 2009).
</p>
<p>The imager should have a sufficient number of pixel ele-
ments so that the angular resolution is adequate for detection. 
In addition, it is extremely useful to be able to bin the pixels 
in the detector. Binning pixels simply means that adjacent 
pixels are summed together (normally in specific patterns 
like 2 &times; 2 or 4 &times; 4) to increase the signal but with a decrease 
in pattern resolution. Currently, detectors are capable of col-
lecting more than 1000 patterns per second when heavily 
binned and with sufficient electron beam current.
</p>
<p>The entire detector must be mounted on a precision 
retractable stage. The precision retractable stage allows the 
detector assembly to be moved into the same position each 
time the detector is inserted to maintain the geometrical cali-
bration of the system. It is important to position the detector 
close to the sample, generally the sample to detector distance 
should be on the order of or even slightly less than the fluo-
rescent screen diameter so that a large portion of the EBSD 
pattern may be collected. The insertion mechanism is motor-
ized to allow the camera to be moved into position in a mat-
ter of few seconds. A typical arrangement of the sample and 
</p>
<p>the EBSD camera or detector is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;29.12. Also 
visible at the bottom of the EBSD detector are the forescat-
tered electron detectors. These solid state detectors provide 
excellent crystallographic contrast when the sample is highly 
tilted and standard backscattered or secondary electron 
imaging are not optimal.
</p>
<p>29.2.3  EBSD Spatial Resolution
</p>
<p>It is important to understand the volume from which the dif-
fraction pattern is generated in the SEM.&nbsp; In many applica-
tions the highest resolution is not required to utilize EBSD 
for the mapping of the texture of a microstructure. However, 
there are applications where high spatial resolution is 
required. Examples are the mapping of deformed micro-
structures or the study of fine grained materials.
</p>
<p>The formation of EBSD patterns depends on the scatter-
ing and subsequent diffraction of electrons. Bragg&rsquo;s Law 
describes the diffraction of specific wavelengths of electrons 
from the planes in a crystalline solid. If there is a large spread 
in the energy of the electrons that are exiting the sample sur-
face we would not expect to see the lines that we see in our 
EBSD patterns due to diffraction. These lines are in nearly the 
exactly correct position as described by the Bragg diffraction 
of the electrons based on the beam voltage used to produce 
the patterns. From this we must conclude that the electrons 
leaving the surface are of nearly the same energy. Electrons 
that have lost larger amounts of energy contribute to the 
background intensity and do not contribute to the diffraction 
features that we want to observe (Deal et&nbsp;al. 2008).

</p>
<p>For EBSD, we tilt the sample at a high angle with respect 
to the electron beam. This tilt is important to obtaining the 
high quality patterns that are needed for EBSD.&nbsp;As shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 29.13, the tilt angle has a large effect on the pattern 
quality. The best pattern qualities are obtained at higher tilt 
angles with some optimal condition between the pattern 
quality and the ease of imaging of the highly tilted sample. 
. Figure&nbsp;29.14a shows the backscattered electron energy dis-
tribution that is developed from a highly titled sample (70&deg; 
tilt) compared to 0&deg; tilt. Note that the energy is highly peaked 
toward the operating voltage of the microscope at 70&deg; tilt 
when compared to the same distribution from an electron 
beam that is normal to the sample surface. Further, since the 
EBSD pattern is clearly visible, they must form from only the 
electrons that have lost either no or a small amount of their 
energy. The electrons that have lost only a small amount of 
their energy are emitted from the sample in regions that are 
very close to the original beam foot print on the surface of 
the sample. This is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;29.14b, which is a Monte 
Carlo simulation of the distance from the initial beam impact 
point that the electrons emerge from the sample surface for 
all the backscattered electrons, those that lost up to 2&nbsp;kV and 
</p>
<p>those that lost only 0.2&nbsp;kV.&nbsp;The pattern is formed from these 
low loss electrons and thus the resolution is quite good. Thus, 
although EBSD involves backscattered electrons, it is a tech-
nique with much higher spatial resolution than standard 
backscattered electron imaging. Typically, resolutions of bet-
ter than 0.1&nbsp;μm can be achieved for a beam voltage of 20&nbsp;kV 
in the transition metals. The electrons that have lost larger 
amounts of energy will contribute the background intensity 
in the EBSD pattern. These electrons are the main reason 
why there is limited contrast in EBSD patterns without some 
form of background removal either through division or sub-
traction or some other computational method of removal 
(Michael and Goehner 1996).
</p>
<p>The high tilt angle limits the spatial resolution attainable 
due to the elongation of the electron beam foot print on the 
sample surface. The resolution parallel to the tilt axis is much 
better than the resolution perpendicular to the tilt axis due to 
the high sample tilt angles used to acquire EBSD patterns. 
The resolution perpendicular to the tilt axis is related to the 
resolution parallel to the tilt axis by

to the tilt axis for a tilt angle of 70&deg; and increases to 5.75 times 
for a tilt angle of 80&deg;. Thus, it is best to work at the lowest 
sample tilt angles possible consistent with obtaining good 
EBSD patterns.
</p>
<p>29.2.4  How Does a&nbsp;Modern EBSD System 
Index Patterns
</p>
<p>Modern EBSD systems all use the same basic steps to go from 
a collected EBSD pattern to indexing and to the determina-
tion of the crystal orientation with respect to a reference 
frame. Once the pattern is collected, the necessary informa-
tion for indexing of the pattern (indexing refers to assigning 
a consistent set of crystallographic directions to the pattern 
with respect to a given or a set of given candidate structures) 
must be derived from the diffraction pattern. Once the pat-
tern has been indexed correctly (various vendors use differ-
ent measures of what constitutes correct indexing), it is a 
simple matter to determine the crystallographic orientation 
represented by the EBSD pattern.
</p>
<p>The most important factor in obtaining a quality orienta-
tion is that the system have good quality patterns for index-
ing. The quality of the detected patterns needed for a given 
experimental measurement can be influenced by choices 
made over how the camera is operated. EBSD patterns are of 
low inherent contrast mainly due to electrons that have lost 
</p>
<p>significant amounts of energy contributing to the overall 
intensity of the pattern background. To compensate for this, 
methods of removing the background are utilized. Some sys-
tems use a software-generated background to compensate for 
the background and increase the pattern contrast. A more 
established approach uses a background image obtained by 
scanning over a large number of grains that produce the 
background signal. This background is then used to normal-
ize the raw EBSD pattern to produce a pattern with high con-
trast (Michael and Goehner 1996).
</p>
<p>EBSD cameras are generally able to collect patterns at 
higher angular resolution per pixel than is needed for most 
orientation mapping. However, if high accuracy is needed, it 
is possible to use the full resolution of the camera to produce 
EBSD patterns. The disadvantage of using the full resolution 
of the EBSD camera is that longer exposure times are needed 
to produce usable EBSD patterns. This longer exposure can 
really slow down map acquisition. It is possible to bin the 
camera resolution, usually by factors of 2, to produce lower 
resolution patterns but with the ability to collect the patterns 
at a much higher collection rate. Thus, if the high angular 
resolution is not required, the camera should be used at a 
reduced resolution, (2 &times; 2, 4 &times; 4, or 8 &times; 8 binning) to speed up 
the acquisition. The tradeoff is between orientation accuracy 
and speed of the measurement.
</p>
<p>Once the camera is set correctly for the given experiment, 
the patterns should be of high quality with good contrast. 
The next step is for the software to extract the line positions 
from the collected pattern. In all modern systems this is 
accomplished with an algorithm called the Hough Transform, 
which takes straight lines and transfers them into points

</p>
<p>which are easier for image analysis software to find. It is  
possible to adjust the resolution parameters of the Hough 
transform to give higher accuracy results, but again at the 
expense of time.
</p>
<p>The next step is to compare the angles between the bands 
in the patterns with a look up table populated with the calcu-
lated values of interplanar angles from a candidate phase 
crystal structure. Once a consistent set of indices are found 
the pattern is considered to be indexed. No indexing will ever 
be perfect so the deviation between the calculated pattern 
and the experimentally measured lines is used as a quality 
metric that is stored with the data. The orientation of the 
crystal at each pixel can be calculated with respect to the axes 
of the microscope and then stored.
</p>
<p>It is important to store as much data as possible for each 
pixel. Sometimes it may be advantageous to store the com-
plete EBSD pattern at each pixel, particularly when one may 
wish to reanalyze the data using a different match unit to help 
figure out missing pixels that did not index. The data that 
should be stored with each pixel at a minimum should 
include the pixel coordinates, the phase match, representa-
tion of the pixel orientation, some sort of pattern quality 
metric, and the indexing confidence or error. This procedure 
of pattern acquisition, line position identification, pattern 
indexing, and data storage is repeated for every pixel in the 
map area.
</p>
<p>29.2.5  Steps in&nbsp;Typical EBSD Measurements
</p>
<p>The conduct of an EBSD experiment in order to collect orien-
tation maps or perform phase identification from a crystalline 
sample requires that the user complete a number of steps, as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;29.15. These steps consist of the following:
 1. Prepare Sample&mdash;samples must be free of 
</p>
<p>polishing-induced damage
 2. Align sample in the SEM&mdash;select the optimal sample tilt 
</p>
<p>and mounting
 3. Adjust SEM and set EBSD parameters&mdash;select voltage 
</p>
<p>and current and detector settings
 4. Check for patterns&mdash;make sure patterns are the highest 
</p>
<p>quality consistent with the needed speed
 5. Run automated map&mdash;start the EBSD map and monitor 
</p>
<p>quality of map in terms of the number of pixels indexed.
</p>
<p>Each step in this sequence is necessary to obtaining high- 
quality EBSD results and will be considered separately below.
</p>
<p> Sample Preparation for&nbsp;EBSD
</p>
<p>As in all materials characterization using the SEM, the prepa-
ration of a sample that is representative of the starting mate-
rial is critical to the success of an EBSD measurement. 
Although some samples may not require any sample prepara-
tion at all, such as grown thin films on substrates, naturally 
occurring crystals, and others, most EBSD samples will 
require preparation. The main requirement of sample prepa-
ration for EBSD is that the sample analysis surface is free from 
</p>
<p>damage associated with the sectioning and polishing steps. In 
most cases, this simply implies standard metallographic pol-
ishing techniques applied carefully to the sample. Standard 
preparation techniques include sectioning, mounting grind-
ing and final polishing are the starting point for preparing 
samples suitable for EBSD.&nbsp;It is the final polishing step that 
must be conducted in a manner that leaves the surface free of 
any sectioning damage. As noted previously, like electron 
channeling the EBSD pattern originates from a very thin sur-
face layer of the sample. Final polishing with colloidal suspen-
sions, electro-polishing, and ion polishing are all methods 
that have been proven effective for EBSD.&nbsp;Chemical etching is 
also sometimes useful but should be applied with caution as 
the surface topography and any oxide films should be avoided 
for the best EBSD results. It is of course quite useful to assess 
the microstructure with optical microscopy prior to attempt-
ing any EBSD measurements.
</p>
<p>Once the sample is prepared and placed in the SEM cham-
ber it is often possible to assess the odds of success before any 
EBSD measurements are made. One of the most helpful  
methods is channeling contrast or grain contrast imaging 
using short working distances and a solid state back scattered 
electron detector. In this method the sample is moved rela-
tively close to the backscatter detector (4&ndash;10-mm working 
distance depending on the sample and the SEM

<p>instrumentation particulars) and a backscattered electron 
image obtained. These images are sensitive to the crystallogra-
phy of the sample and the grain orientation will determine the 
backscatter coefficient leading to beautiful images of the sam-
ple grain structure. In many cases, subsurface scratches and 
other sample preparation artifacts will be visible in this type of 
image that is not seen in secondary electron images or optical 
microscopy. . Figure&nbsp; 29.16 is an example of a high-quality 
metallographically polished sample image of a dual phase 
stainless steel. Note that the sample as polished with no col-
loidal silica polishing exhibits a large number of subsurface 
scratches that limit the EBSD results. After colloidal polishing 
for a few hours the difference in surface condition is readily 
apparent. Generally, results like these are a good predictor of a 
successful EBSD analysis.
</p>
<p> Align Sample in&nbsp;the&nbsp;SEM
</p>
<p>After the sample is imaged and the sample preparation found 
to be of good quality, the sample orientation within the SEM 
must be considered. EBSD is often used to determine the tex-
ture or distribution of crystallographic orientations with 
respect to some external frame of reference related to the 
sample or how the sample was processed. A good example of 
this is when metal plates are produced by mechanical rolling. 
It is often desired to determine the texture of the sample with 
respect to the rolling direction, the transverse direction, or 
the plate normal direction. Or for the case where only one 
direction of the sample is expected to show a preferred tex-
ture, as in a wire where the preferred crystallographic direc-
tion lies along the wire axis, this axis should be mounted 
parallel to one of the primary directions in the SEM.&nbsp;Other 
times it is an assessment of the crystallographic growth direc-
tion and thus the sample should be carefully aligned so that 
the growth direction corresponds to one of the primary axes 
of the scanned image. Thus, the sample must be carefully 
aligned in the SEM, and one must be aware of the tilt axis of 
the SEM stage and the directions of the x- and y-stage move-
ments (Britton et&nbsp;al. 2016).
</p>
<p>Once the external reference directions have been set par-
allel to the microscope reference direction, then the sample 
still must be tilted for EBSD examination. For the best EBSD 
the sample must be tilted to about 70&deg; with respect to the 
electron beam. This tilt is best performed with a view of the 
inside of the chamber with a video image so that the high tilt 
does not result in the sample contacting the microscope pole 
piece or other hard expensive components of the micro-
scope. Once the sample is tilted to the appropriate angle and 
the area of interest brought under the electron beam then 
the EBSD camera must be moved into position. The best 
camera position is close to the sample so that the camera 
captures about 60&ndash;90&deg; of the pattern. Also the brightest part 
of the pattern should be located about one third of the total 
camera area down from the top of the active area. This posi-
tion will give the best possibility of good patterns being 
obtained.
</p>
<p> Check for&nbsp;EBSD Patterns
</p>
<p>Once the sample has been prepared appropriately and posi-
tioned correctly within the SEM, it is sensible to have a quick 
collection of a few randomly located points to ensure that 
good patterns can be obtained. This is the opportunity to 
optimize the SEM parameters for the acquisition. This is also 
an excellent opportunity to determine that the phases 
selected for indexing are chosen correctly. Correct comple-
tion of these steps will go a long way to ensure that a quality 
orientation map can be collected.
</p>
<p>The first step is to select correct microscope parameters 
for EBSD acquisition. The accelerating voltage is not 
extremely critical for success but should be set somewhere 
between 10 and 20&nbsp;kV depending on the sample that is to be 
analyzed. The other microscope-critical setting is the current 
in the electron beam. In general, the best choice is the highest 
beam current that the microscope can generate consistent

</p>
<p>with the beam&rsquo;s size not being larger than the features of 
interest within the sample. Modern EBSD cameras have been 
developed to be more sensitive and capable of dealing with 
lower beam currents. This in practice means that one should 
try settings that generate 1&ndash;2&nbsp;nA as a starting point. Higher 
beam currents will be desirable for faster EBSD map acquisi-
tion. Once these conditions are set, a few patterns should be 
collected. If patterns are of poor quality it may be necessary 
to revisit the sample preparation steps used and modify them 
in order to reduce the surface damage. Although some fine 
tuning of the microscope operating conditions may improve 
the pattern quality, microscope operating conditions cannot 
make up for poor quality patterns due to inadequate sample 
preparation.
</p>
<p>If good quality patterns are obtained, it now an excellent 
time to determine that appropriate match units have been 
selected from a database of crystallographic structures. For 
the highest-quality EBSD work, one should try and calibrate 
the EBSD camera geometry for each experiment. Modern 
systems will use one of the known phases from the sample (if 
you have a known phase) and the crystallographic data file 
selected to try and index one or multiple diffraction patterns. 
Once a match has been found, the software will attempt to 
vary the calibration parameters to select the parameters that 
give the best fit to the observed EBSD pattern. Once this is 
done one can assume the system is adequately calibrated. It is 
recommended though that multiple points be tried to make 
sure calibration is optimal.
</p>
<p>As discussed, EBSD is not a method that is routinely used 
to determine the crystal structure of the sample, although 
there has been work in this area, but it is a method that 
requires suitable match units to successfully index the EBSD 
patterns. Excellent quality EBSD patterns will not be indexed 
if an incorrect candidate unit cell has been selected. One 
should attempt to index a few of the patterns obtained from 
the sample with the selected candidate unit cells. If indexing 
is not possible, then it may be necessary to change the candi-
date unit cell and attempt indexing. In the case of a multi- 
phase sample it is important to collect patterns from all of the 
phases and insure that they can be indexed from the list of 
candidate unit cells.
</p>
<p> Adjust SEM and&nbsp;Select EBSD Map Parameters
</p>
<p>The analysis is now at the point where the quality of the EBSD 
patterns and therefore the sample preparation has been 
assessed and found to be adequate. The sample has been cor-
rectly positioned within the microscope with respect to col-
lecting data that is referenced to the sample and the 
microscope operating conditions have been optimized. The 
EBSD collection is nearly ready to proceed with a few other 
details.
</p>
<p>First, due to the high tilt of the sample it will be apparent 
at lower magnifications that the areas of the sample away 
from the focus point will be out of focus. The best way to 
</p>
<p>deal with this issue is the use of dynamic focus as discussed 
elsewhere in this book. In brief, the dynamic focus adjusts 
the focus so that the electron beam focus is changed with 
respect to the position of the electron beam on the sample. 
This is of most importance for low magnification detailed 
scans but may still provide some advantages at higher mag-
nifications as well. Once the dynamic focus has been prop-
erly set up, one can collect the desired SEM images of the 
sample.
</p>
<p>EBSD is useful for a range of samples that include elec-
trical conductors, like metals through electrically insulating 
oxide. For insulating samples or metal samples mounted for 
metallography, methods must be employed to reduce charg-
ing of the sample. Sample charging is an important issue as 
charging in the extreme can result in pattern distortions to 
the point that the patterns are no longer useful and if only a 
minor effect sample drift may result causing the resulting 
images and maps to be distorted. It is sometimes adequate 
to sputter coat samples to ensure conductivity. However, 
this coating should be kept as thin as possible and it is best 
to use metal films rather than carbon coating as the conduc-
tivity of metal coating are usually much higher. If the sam-
ple cannot be coated there is another approach that has been 
found to be quite useful and that is the use of variable pres-
sure in the sample chamber. The introduction of a low pres-
sure, generally only a few 10&ndash;20&nbsp; Pa, is required to reduce 
charging effects for EBSD.&nbsp; If a pressure that is too high is 
utilized there will be a noticeable degradation of the pattern 
quality due to scattering of the electrons between the sample 
and the phosphor screen. Thus, some trial and error may be 
required to set the conditions correctly (El-Dasher and 
Torres 2009).
</p>
<p>There is no absolutely correct way to set up EBSD map 
parameters due to the variety of sample types and the 
information that may be required. There are a few simple 
things that can be done to ensure that quality orientation 
data are collected. One, the most important is to determine 
the step size that will be used for the EBSD map. If too 
large of a step size is selected, important details of the 
microstructure may be missed; and conversely if too fine of 
a step size is used, the resulting maps may be of high qual-
ity but will have taken much longer to acquire than if a 
larger step size had been selected. One strategy for an 
unknown sample is to start with a coarse step size so that a 
rather quick map can be obtained and allow better sam-
pling strategies to be developed. The large step size map 
will allow the user to determine if the candidate match 
phase or phases are appropriate, get an estimate of the 
grain size and to begin to visualize the microstructure of 
the sample. The large-step-size image will then allow a bet-
ter selection of step size for more detailed studies. One rule 
of thumb is that at least 10 points across the diameter of a 
grain are required for a reasonable assessment of the 
grain&nbsp;size.

</p>
<p> Run the&nbsp;Automated Map
</p>
<p>Once all of the previous steps have been carried out it is now 
time to collect the crystallographic orientations. Once the 
run is started the software will collect an EBSD pattern at 
each pixel, detect the bands in the EBSD pattern, calculate 
the best fit to the band positions using the candidate crystal 
structures, calculate the unit cell orientation, save the infor-
mation and move to the next pixel and repeat this series. 
Even though modern EBSD systems are capable of running 
100&ndash;1000 patterns each second, larger maps may consist of 
more than a million pixels and thus require hours or days to 
collect. A map of 2000 &times; 1000&nbsp;pixels taken at a setting that 
allows 100 patterns to be collected and analyzed each second 
will require nearly 6 h to complete. Faster acquisition rates 
are available but at the expense of orientation accuracy or 
noise. Quite often it is most efficient to run these longer 
acquisitions overnight when the SEM is not being utilized 
anyway. These long acquisition times put extra emphasis in 
the microscope&rsquo;s environment in order that sample drift due 
to temperature changes or other disturbances are minimized. 
It is also quite useful to post a note on the operating panel of 
the SEM so that the next user does not disturb an ongoing 
acquisition or assume that the microscope has been left in a 
safe condition with respect to the inserted EBSD cameras.
</p>
<p>29.2.6  Display of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Acquired Data
</p>
<p>EBSD is somewhat unique in analytical techniques as there 
are so many ways to present the collected data in meaningful 
ways. Of course, everyone likes to produce beautiful color 
maps of microstructures, but in reality it is not just the images 
that are important but the crystallographic data that is con-
tained in every point in an image that is important. In order 
to get that data, one must begin to use and understand crys-
tallographic representations of the sample that are not simple 
images. Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to 
describe every possible way that EBSD data can be displayed 
it is important to at least introduce these and how they might 
be utilized (Randle and Engler 2000).
</p>
<p>Quite often, the first map that EBSD practitioners display 
is called a band contrast or an image quality map or other 
names depending on the particular vendor involved. These 
images are most commonly shown as gray-scale images 
where the gray level is scaled by some measure of the quality 
of the pixel by pixel EBSD pattern. The sharper or more 
defined the pattern is the higher the gray level in the image. 
These images can be striking representations of the micro-
structure of the sample and can reveal microstructural details 
not clearly visible in either light-optical microscope images 
or secondary or backscattered electron images in the SEM.
</p>
<p>One of the most common ways to display EBSD orienta-
tion data is with orientation maps. More accurately these are 
called inverse pole figure maps with respect to a specific 
</p>
<p>physical direction. In order to understand inverse pole figure 
maps it is important to understand what are pole figures and 
inverse pole figures and how to interpret them.
</p>
<p>Pole figures are used to answer the question, Where does 
a particular crystallographic direction or plane fall in space 
relative to some arbitrary physical sample direction or plane? 
Pole figures have been used for many years and are very com-
mon in the preferred orientation or texture literature. In 
many cases a single pole figure does not provide sufficient 
information and additional pole figures of other crystallo-
graphic directions are required. A pole figure is simply a ste-
reogram with the axes defined by the external reference 
frame. It is common for evaporated or deposited thin films to 
have a specific crystallographic direction parallel to the film 
growth direction. . Figure&nbsp; 29.17 is a series of pole figures 
from an evaporated Au thin film. In this example we show the 
[111] and the [110] pole figures. For the &lt;111 &gt; pole figure we 
note that there is a large number of poles plotted in the center 
of the pole figure. This shows that many of the pixels in the 
data set have the &lt;111 &gt; direction aligned with the sample 
normal. There are additional rings also in the &lt;111 &gt; pole fig-
ure. These are a result of there being more than one &lt;111 &gt; type 
direction in a cubic crystal (in fact there are actually four of 
these present). In the &lt;110 &gt; pole figure we see that there is a 
number of poles in the center of the pole figure indicating 
that there are a number of measured pixels with &lt;110 &gt; direc-
tions parallel to the sample normal direction.
</p>
<p>Inverse pole figures are used to answer the question, 
What crystallographic poles or planes are preferentially par-
allel or perpendicular to a specific sample direction? We usu-
ally again display these with respect to the physical axes of 
the microscope or the sample as described for the pole fig-
ures. For inverse pole figures we plot all of the directions that 
are pointing in a specific direction of the sample. Inverse pole 
figures are extremely useful for samples where there are spe-
cific axes of the sample that have a preferred crystallographic 
direction. . Figure&nbsp;29.18 is an example of inverse pole figures 
plotted for the same Au-thin film shown in . Fig.&nbsp;29.17. It is 
often helpful to show all three orthogonal directions so that 
the preferred texture can be visualized. Note that the inverse 
pole figures of . Fig.&nbsp;29.18 show exactly the same informa-
tion that is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;29.17. It is sometimes helpful to 
first plot the inverse pole figures as they will give an indica-
tion of the samples texture without plotting pole figures of 
many different directions. The Z or surface normal direction 
of the inverse pole figures of . Fig.&nbsp;29.18 is the one that car-
ries the most information about the sample. Here we see the 
high density of pixel orientations that are clustered around 
the &lt;111 &gt; and less so around the &lt;110 &gt; directions.
</p>
<p>Once we are familiar with the concepts of pole figures 
and inverse pole figures, we can then go ahead and under-
stand inverse pole figure maps which are one of the more 
common ways that EBSD orientation data is shown. An 
inverse pole figure map extends the idea of an inverse pole

color to each direction in the inverse pole figure stereo-
graphic triangle. A common way this is done is shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 29.19. Inverse pole figure maps are then plotted by

these areas have an &lt;110 &gt; direction parallel to the surface

direction looks totally different to the Z inverse pole figure 
map. Both of these are shown in . Fig.&nbsp;29.20.
</p>
<p>29.2.7  Other Map Components
</p>
<p>Once the orientations of the pixels in an array are known, it is 
now possible to add additional information to the maps. 
There are many possible components the can be plotted based 
on EBSD data. One of the easiest components to add is that of 
grain boundaries. Grain boundaries are the planes (which 
intersect the planar surface as lines) that separate two regions 
of different crystallographic orientations. It is fairly trivial to 
calculate the change in orientations between two pixels. If we 
do this for an entire map we can then plot lines where the dif-
ference in orientations between two adjacent pixels exceeds a 
predefined limit. It is typically assumed that a grain boundary 
is represented by a change in orientation that exceeds 10&deg;. 
. Figure&nbsp;29.20 has black lines plotted where the change in ori-
entation exceeds this limit and thus the map shows the size of 
individual grains even though they are of consistent color due 
to the grain orientations with respect to the sample normal.
</p>
<p>29.2.8  Dangers and&nbsp;Practice of&nbsp;&ldquo;Cleaning&rdquo; 
EBSD Data
</p>
<p>Many of the currently available software platforms for EBSD 
allow users to modify the inverse pole figure maps in order to 
improve their appearance only (Brewer and Michael 2010). 
There are always pixels in a map that are either not indexed due 
to pattern quality or many other reasons or that are mis- 
indexed due to some sort of symmetry issues or multiple pos-
sible solutions to the bands that are found. These cleaning 
routines normally perform two separate operations. The first 
step is to remove the mis-indexed pixels. These pixels usually

</p>
<p>color key is used to color each pixel in an image to produce an inverse 
</p>
<p>pole figure map or image. Thus, if a pixel has a &lt;001 &gt; direction parallel 
</p>
<p>to a specific direction then we use this inverse pole figure key to plot 
</p>
<p>that pixel as red. Or conversely, if we observe a red pixel in an orienta-
</p>
<p>tion map we know the orientation of that pixel is close to &lt;100 &gt; paral-
</p>

</p>
<p>show up as single pixels surrounded by correctly indexed pix-
els. The software searches through the data and where there is 
a single pixel of a different orientation surrounded by pixels of 
a different but similar orientation, the single mis- indexed pixel 
is replaced by the average of the surrounding orientations. The 
next step is to deal with the pixels that are not indexed. The 
same procedure is applied as with the single mis-indexed pixels 
in that kernel math is used. Each individual pixel has six near-
est neighbors. If a cleaning procedure that requires six nearest 
neighbors to agree then the single un-indexed pixel is assigned 
the average orientation of it&rsquo;s nearest neighbors. These proce-
dures allow the user to select the number of nearest neighbors 
that must agree and using less than six nearest neighbors allows 
larger regions of pixels with no correct indexing to be replaced. 
Use of these procedures can be very dangerous and must be 
disclosed when inverse pole figure maps are published.
</p>
<p>29.2.9  Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction 
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;SEM
</p>
<p>One of the limitations of EBSD is that the resolution is com-
promised by the fact that the patterns are formed by back-
scattered electrons and that the sample is highly tilted leading 
to the previously mentioned fact that the resolution perpen-
dicular to the tilt axis is much worse than that parallel to the 
tilt axis. The resolution can be greatly improved if the back-
scattered volume is reduced and the geometrical factors are 
reduced. One could image EBSD at reduced voltages to 
reduce the interaction volume, but this process has practical 
limitations related to the need for increased sample prepara-
tion quality. Also, improved EBSD cameras would be needed 
to take advantage of lower voltage operation. Lower voltage 
operation does nothing to reduce the geometrical effects.
</p>
<p>Transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD, although some in 
the literature have referred to this method as t-EBSD, which is 
</p>
<p>the acronym for transmission electron backscattered diffraction, 
which is a rather non-physical description due to the inclusion 
of both transmission and backscattered in the name) is the 
transmission analog to EBSD is a way to achieve extremely high 
spatial resolution for crystallographic orientation or phase map-
ping (Keller and Geiss 2012; Trimby 2012). TKD is realized by 
using an electron-transparent sample, as in the transmission 
electron microscope, that is held at normal or near- normal inci-
dence with respect to the electron beam while a standard EBSD 
camera is placed at the exit surface of the sample, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;29.21. Here the electron beam accelerating voltage must 
be high and the sample must be thin in order for transmission of 
the electrons to occur. The maximum beam energy typically 
available in modern SEMs is 30&nbsp;kV, which requires that the sam-
ple must be quite thin. The use of a thin sample limits the size of 
the beam interaction volume within the sample and immedi-
ately improves the spatial resolution of TKD.&nbsp; In addition, the 
fact that the sample may be oriented normal to the incident elec-
tron beam further improves the resolution to the point that 
2-nm spatial resolution has been achieved in TKD.&nbsp;It is incredi-
bly fortuitous that the TKD patterns are extremely similar in 
appearance to EBSD patterns, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;29.22, and can 
be collected with the same cameras and the same analysis soft-
ware as is used for EBSD.&nbsp;There are two main disadvantages to 
TKD.&nbsp;First, it may be difficult to produce appropriate thin sam-
ples. However, most laboratories will have access to a dual-plat-
form FIB/SEM and thin samples prepared with FIB are perfectly 
adequate for TKD.&nbsp;The second disadvantage is that when a small 
pixel size is needed, it is difficult to map larger regions. For 
example, if a map step size of 4&nbsp;nm is selected, a 1000 &times; 1000&nbsp;pixel 
map will only cover 4 &times; 4&nbsp;μm. However, if orientation mapping 
of extremely fine grained material is needed, TKD may be the 
only way to achieve the resolution needed.

ple of polycrystalline Si layers in a semiconductor device is

Formation
</p>

ceramics, to semiconductors to metals and alloys. It has also 
has been applied to understanding metallic meteorites and 
</p>
<p>their thermal history. One example of this will be illustrated 
with the Gibeon meteorite. There has been interest in 
understanding the beautiful Widmanstatten pattern that is 
seen in these meteorites and how this two phase structure 
of ferrite (body-centered cubic crystal structure) and aus-
tenite (face-centered cubic crystal structure). Previous 
work had studied the formation of this structure and most 
of those studies had assumed that at high temperatures in 
the parent asteroid the meteorite consisted of very large 
grains of austenite. During the cooling of this meteorite in 
space over many millions of years the austenite was assumed

</p>
<p>to have fully transformed to ferrite. On further cooling, the 
ferrite, super-saturated with Ni, then was thought to decom-
pose to the two phase ferrite plus austenite structure. 
However, EBSD has shown that this is not be the correct 
path for the observed microstructural evolution (Goldstein 
and Michael 2006).
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp; 29.24a is a large-area EBSD map acquired by 
mapping smaller areas of about 1 &times; 1&nbsp;mm and tiling together 
220 of these tiles into a large area map that covers 22 &times; 10&nbsp;mm 
with a 3-μm step size. The sample was mechanically polished 
using standard metallographic practice followed by a few 
hours of vibratory polishing on colloidal silica. The entire 
map shown consists of a more than 25 million individual pix-
els. The general microstructure at a low magnification is 
clearly visible in . Fig.&nbsp;29.24a. . Figure&nbsp;29.24b shows a band 
contrast image of the ferrite and the austenite as an inverse 
pole figure map with respect to the sample surface normal. 
Note that all of the austenite has the same or very close to the 
same orientation, as shown by the austenite all of the same 
color in the inverse pole figure map. This is an important 
observation as the austenite could not have formed from pre-
cipitation from the ferrite but must be remnants of the origi-
nal large austenite grains found in the parent meteorite body 
at elevated temperatures early in the meteorites life. This is 
further demonstrated by the pole figures shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;29.25. The austenite pole figures show that there is only 
a single orientation of austenite in the 22 mm &times; 10 mm area. 
</p>
<p>The ferrite pole figures are much more complicated and are a 
result of the many variants of ferrite that form from a single 
orientation of austenite.
</p>
<p>There are also regions in . Fig.&nbsp;29.24a that are very fine 
grained and difficult to resolve with the 3-μm step size used. 
Further examination of the microstructure showed that these 
regions were extremely fine grained and required higher res-
olution than can be achieved with using bulk EBSD.&nbsp;Due to 
the small feature size in these areas, TKD is an excellent 
method to utilize. . Figure&nbsp; 29.26 is a secondary electron 
image of a focused ion beam produced thin sample. Also 
shown is a scanning transmission electron image acquired at 
30&nbsp;kV which demonstrates that the sample is sufficiently thin 
for the transmission of 30&nbsp;kV electrons. . Figure&nbsp;29.27 is the 
resulting TKD map and phase information obtained from the 
thin sample using an on-axis TKD detector. The step size for 
this image was 4&nbsp;nm. It is now clear from these images that 
the fine-grained regions in . Fig.&nbsp;29.24a consist of regions of 
single crystal austenite that can be seen in . Fig.&nbsp;29.24b but 
also regions of ferrite that have begun to decompose during 
cooling to the equilibrium austenite plus ferrite that would be 
expected. The presence of twinned austenite precipitates is 
somewhat surprising, but may be explained by some of the 
stress in the sample during transformation.
</p>

to complex microstructures and how the use of TKD is 
extremely complementary to EBSD.&nbsp;The visualization of the

<p>texture of the samples and an understanding of the fine 
details present in the microstructure were extremely useful 
in determining the cooling history and the microstructural 
development in this meteorite. It should also not be lost on 
the reader that EBSD and the related TKD span a huge range 
of length scales from collecting large mm sized regions to 
using extremely small step sizes to elucidate the nm scalede-
tails of the microstructure.
</p>
<p>29.2.11  Summary
</p>
<p>EBSD and the related technique of TKD are an important 
part of crystalline materials characterization in the SEM.&nbsp;With 
EBSD the SEM can now be considered a complete materials 
characterization tool that can not only take excellent quality 
images of samples but can determine the elemental constitu-
ents of the sample as well as the detailed crystallography.
</p>
<p>29.2.12  Electron Backscatter Diffraction 
Checklist
</p>
<p> Specimen Considerations
</p>
<p>EBSD requires a properly prepared sample that is securely 
attached to an appropriate support as the sample will be tilted 
to high angles to facilitate EBSD pattern acquisition. The 
sample surface should be free of artifacts due to sample prep-
aration. Due to the high sample tilt and the generally long 
acquisition times required for EBSD, carbon tape is not a 
good choice as it tends to creep allowing the sample to move 
causing drift related image issues. Samples mounted in epoxy 
metallographic mounting materials are subject to drift caused 
</p>
<p>by charging of the polymer material. It is satisfactory to 
lightly conductively coat the specimen for EBSD analysis 
provided the coating is kept as thin as possible while remain-
ing adequate for charge removal.
</p>
<p>Non-conductive samples may also be lightly coated for 
analysis as discussed above. It is also possible to utilize the 
variable pressure mode of operation to reduce charging 
related artifacts. One must carefully choose the correct pres-
sure to be used as too high of a pressure will result in blurred 
patterns due to scattering in the gas and too low of a pressure 
may not control the charging.
</p>
<p>Proper positioning of the specimen within the SEM is criti-
cal. One must remember that the sample will be tilted to a high 
angle for analysis. The high tilt required for EBSD will limit 
how tall the sample is and how it must be mounted on the SEM 
sample stage. A sample that is too short may also present dif-
ficulties in positioning the sample in the proper location.
</p>
<p> EBSD Detector
</p>
<p>Due to the limited space in most SEM sample chambers, it 
is best to position the sample so that the sample is tilted 
appropriately and the area to be analyzed is in the field of 
view. Once the sample position has been established the 
EBSD detector should be introduced. The exact location of 
the detector is not extremely important, but the sample to 
detector distance should be sufficiently short so that a large 
solid angle can be obtained and the brightest part of the pat-
tern located in the upper half of the detector image. It is 
very important to keep in mind the position of the sample 
and the detector as there are two kinds of people who use 
EBSD: Those who have hit the EBSD detector and those 
who will. So be careful when moving the sample and the 
detector. A chamberscope is absolutely required for safe 
EBSD operation.

</p>
<p> Selection of&nbsp;Candidate Crystallographic 
Phases
</p>
<p>EBSD requires the possible phases that will be analyzed to be 
selected before the analysis is started. Generally, EBSD is 
conducted on samples that are already well characterized 
with respect to the phases that are present. Modern systems 
are capable of sorting through a large number of phases to 
match with the experimental patterns, but the operator 
should try to keep this list to a minimum to allow maximum 
speed of acquisition. There are many databases that provide 
crystallographic data and it is also possible for the operator to 
input specific descriptions of unit cells.
</p>
<p> Microscope Operating Conditions and&nbsp;Pattern 
Optimization
</p>
<p>It is difficult to recommend specific operating conditions for 
EBSD of all samples, but there are starting conditions that 
should allow the system to be set up efficiently. It is suggested 
that 20&nbsp; kV and a beam current of a few nanoamperes is a 
good starting point for EBSD analysis. The quality of EBSD 
patterns can be rapidly assessed under these conditions. For 
faster acquisition higher beam current is always better, as 
long as the resolution is consistent with the microstructural 
length scales that are to be studied. Higher operating voltages 
are also sometimes useful with coated samples, and lower 
voltages may be used to provide an improved spatial resolu-
tion at the expense of acquisition speed. The operator should 
strive for clear patterns. In most commercial systems, the 
operator has a choice of the pattern resolution that is to be 
collected. For many orientation studies, the largest number 
of pixels is almost never needed and the EBSD detector is 
binned to produce larger pixels. For example, a typical EBSD 
detector may have a maximum pixel resolution of 1600 &times; 
1200, but one would not use the full resolution and would 
select to bin the result; so, for example, 4 &times; 4 binning would 
result in an EBSD pattern with 400 &times; 300&nbsp; pixels. Binning 
helps with pattern quality as larger pixels collect more signal 
and thus increasing the S/N of the pattern. Binning of the 
detector allows higher speed acquisitions to be achieved. 
Additional increases in pattern quality can be achieved at the 
expense of collection speed.
</p>
<p>Once the detector settings have been determined it is also 
necessary to select the background removal method. Modern 
EBSD systems have many methods for background removal 
while older systems will be limited. Correct background cor-
rection is important to maximize the signal content of the 
patterns while suppressing the high background contribu-
tion that is always present. For polycrystalline samples, it is 
easy to scan a large representative region of the sample which 
collects the average background levels without the sharp dif-
fraction features. Other methods that utilize a software blur-
ring algorithm may also be utilized and can be better than the 
collected back ground method.
</p>
<p>Now that the sample and the detector position are set and 
beam conditions that provide useful EBSD patterns are estab-
lished, it is now time to calibrate the system. Calibration on 
</p>
<p>modern systems is entirely automatic provided a suitable 
match unit has been specified. It is important that once a cali-
bration has been established that the sample to detector 
geometry not be altered or a new calibration will need to be 
determined.
</p>
<p> Selection of&nbsp;EBSD Acquisition Parameters
</p>
<p>Successful orientation mapping will depend on careful selec-
tion of the mapping parameters and the most important of 
these is specifying the step size or the spacing between indi-
vidual measurement points. A selection of a spacing that is 
too large risks missing the important microstructural fea-
tures and a spacing that is too small will require longer acqui-
sition times with little gain in information. A good starting 
point is to plan on between four and ten&nbsp;pixels or measure-
ments across the smallest features to be studied. This sam-
pling will provide quality images and data while not wasting 
time acquiring redundant information.
</p>
<p>At this time it is useful to acquire electron images of the 
region of interest. Secondary electron imaging may show 
some surface features but imaging of highly polished samples 
may not provide useful information. The use of forescattered 
detectors is recommended as there is a good signal level and 
forescattered images often show surprising high grain 
contrast.
</p>
<p> Collect the&nbsp;Orientation Map
</p>
<p>Now that the experimental conditions for the EBSD acquisi-
tion have been selected it is often best to collect a small map 
to determine if the parameters selected are capable of pro-
ducing a quality result. One of the most common ways to 
judge a quality result is to look at the number or the fraction 
of pixels in the map that have been successfully indexed to a 
certain level of confidence. Modern systems on well-polished 
samples can be capable of indexing 95 % or more of the pix-
els. Of course second phase fractions and grain size can influ-
ence the number of indexed patterns. It is not always 
necessary to have 95 % of the pixels indexed to obtain a useful 
result. If a high fraction of the pixels are not indexed it is 
important to understand the reasons. If the correct phase or 
phases have been selected then it may be that the system was 
not calibrated adequately. If the selected phases are correct 
and the calibration is correct then it is possible that sample 
preparation was not optimal or the sample is heavily 
deformed, leading to the low fraction of indexed pixels. Once 
a satisfactory indexing rate is achieved in the test map it is 
now reasonable to select a larger area for orientation map-
ping and proceed with mapping.

<p>30.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>The use of focused ion beams (FIB) in the field of electron 
microscopy for the preparation of site specific samples and 
for imaging has become very common. Site specific sample 
preparation of cross-section samples is probably the most 
common use of the focused ion beam tools, although there 
are uses for imaging with secondary electrons produced by 
the ion beam. These tools are generally referred to as FIB 
tools, but this name covers a large range of actual tools. There 
are single beam FIB tools which consist of the FIB column on 
a chamber and also the FIB/SEM platforms that include both 
a FIB column for sample preparation and an SEM column for 
observing the sample during preparation and for analyzing 
the sample post-preparation using all of the imaging modali-
ties and analytical tools available on a standard SEM column. 
A vast majority of the FIB tools presently in use are equipped 
with liquid metal ion sources (LMIS) and the most common 
ion species used is Ga. Recent developments have produced 
plasma sources for high current ion beams. The gas field ion 
source (GFIS) is discussed in module 31 on helium ion 
microscopy in this book.
</p>
<p>This chapter will first review ion/solid interactions that 
are important to our use of FIB tools to produce samples that 
are representative of the original material. This discussion 
will then be followed by how FIB tools are used for special-
ized imaging of samples and how they are used to prepare 
samples for a variety of SEM techniques.
</p>
<p>30.2  Ion&ndash;Solid Interactions
</p>
<p>It is important to understand some of the ion-solid interac-
tions that occur so that the user can appreciate why certain 
methods and procedures are followed during sample prepa-
ration. There are many events that occur when an energetic 
ion interacts with the atoms in a solid, but for the case of SEM 
sample preparation and ion imaging we are mainly interested 
in sputtering, secondary electron production and damage to 
</p>
<p>the sample in terms of ion implantation and loss of crystal-
line structure. Sputtering is the process that removes atoms 
from the target. Secondary electron production is important 
as images formed with secondary electrons induced by ions 
have some important advantages over electron-induced sec-
ondary electron imaging. Finally, it is important to realize 
that it is impossible to have an ion beam interact with a sam-
ple without some form of damage occurring that leaves the 
sample different than before the ion irradiation.
</p>
<p>A schematic diagram of the interactions is shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;30.1. Here an energetic ion is injected into a crystalline 
sample. The ion enters the sample at position 1. The ion is 
then deflected by interactions with the atomic nuclei and the 
electron charges. As the ion moves through the sample it has 
sufficient energy to knock other atoms off their respective lat-
tice positions as shown at position 2. The target atoms that 
are knocked off their atomic positions can have enough 
energy to knock other target atoms off their atomic positions 
as shown at position 3. Some of the atoms that have been 
knocked from their atomic positions may reoccupy a lattice 
position or may end up in interstitial sites. There can also be 
lattice sites that are not reoccupied by target atoms and are 
left as vacancies. Both interstitials and vacancies are consid-
ered damage to the crystalline structure of the sample as 
shown in position 4. Most of the time, the original beam ion 
will end up coming to rest within the sample. This is termed 
ion implantation and is shown at position 5. Ion implantation 
results in the detection of the ion beam species in the sample. 
Many of the collision cascades will eventually reach the sur-
face of the sample. Sufficient energy may be imparted to 
knock an atom from the surface into the vacuum. This pro-
cess is called sputtering and results in a net loss of material 
from the sample as shown in position 6. At the same time 
when the ion is either entering or leaving the sample, second-
ary electrons are generated that are useful for producing 
images of the sample surface scanned by the ion beam. It is 
important to remember that scanning an energetic ion beam 
over the surface of the sample will always result in some 
damage to the sample. Understanding the interaction of ions

<p>with the target material is helpful in reducing the amount of 
damage to acceptable or tolerable levels through appropriate 
sample preparation techniques. For a complete review of 
ion&ndash;solid interactions see Nastasi et&nbsp;al. (1996).
</p>
<p>In module 1 on electron&ndash;beam specimen interactions, the 
range that an electron travels in a sample is discussed. Generally 
for medium-energy electrons (15&ndash;20&nbsp;keV) the electron range 
in the transition elements is on the order of 1&nbsp;μm. The ranges 
of heavy ions like Ga and Xe are extremely short when com-
pared to electron ranges for similar energies. . Figure&nbsp;30.2 is a 
plot of the ion ranges for Xe and Ga as a function of the atomic 
number of the target material. Note that the range for either Ga 
or Xe ions with an energy of 30&nbsp;keV is generally much less than 
50&nbsp;nm. Thus, ions travel very short distances in solid targets 
and as a result the near surface region of the sample is where 
the ion interactions take place and where we expect to see the 
crystalline sample damage discussed in . Fig.&nbsp; 30.1 (Nastasi 
et&nbsp;al. 1996; Ziegler and Biersack 1985).
</p>
<p>30.3  Focused Ion Beam Systems
</p>
<p>Modern focused ion beam tools are almost always two- 
column systems with a FIB column and an SEM column 
mounted on one chamber and both columns focused pre-
cisely on the same region of the sample. This allows one to 
use the SEM column to monitor the progress of the FIB mill-
ing that is being performed and to image the sample imme-
diately after preparation. This arrangement also enables the 
use of sequential FIB milling and SEM imaging leading to the 
capability to produce 3D data sets. There are still some highly 
specialized uses for single beam FIB tools; for example, inte-
grated circuit modification is done generally with single 
beam FIB tools. Modern FIB systems utilize either a LMIS 
</p>
<p>source or a plasma source to produce ion beams with variable 
current to allow both large volume removal and fine scale 
polishing of the sample. Both the LMIS and the plasma 
source have advantages and disadvantages. The most com-
mon LMIS produces Ga ions, while it is common for the 
plasma sources to utilize inert gases like Ne, Ar, or Xe. Ga ion 
sources have higher brightness as compared to the plasma 
sources and thus have higher current densities in the focused 
ion spots. Ga is a fairly reactive element, however, and may 
result in artifacts when implanted into some materials. 
Plasma sources have lower brightness but higher overall cur-
rent than the LMIS sources resulting lower current densities 
in the focused spot but much higher total current that allows 
much faster material removal rates when compared to LMIS 
ion sources. Both the LMIS and the plasma ion source utilize 
similar optics to produce focused scanning beams of ions. 
. Figure&nbsp;30.3 shows a schematic of a typical ion column. This 
column resembles a simple SEM column with the exception 
that the magnetic lenses that are used to focus electrons are

<p>not capable of focusing the heavier ions. For ions, the lenses 
are electrostatic and require high voltages to focus energetic 
ions due to their relatively large mass to charge ratio.
</p>
<p>Sample stages must be accurate and reproducible for easy 
and efficient FIB processing of samples. There can be multi-
ple stage moves during the preparation of samples in a FIB 
tool and each move should be reproducible so that the opera-
tor can easily return to the region of interest. Stage accuracy 
and reproducibility has become more important as auto-
mated routines have become common place during the pro-
duction of samples or during sequential milling and imaging 
operations (Giannuzzi 2006; Orloff et&nbsp;al. 2003).
</p>
<p>30.4  Imaging with&nbsp;Ions
</p>
<p>Although FIB is usually used to remove material via sputter-
ing, ions produce a large yield of secondary electrons. The 
secondary electrons signal can be collected and imaged just 
like secondary electrons produced with an electron beam, 
which means we can use all of the detectors that we are very 
familiar with from electron beam imaging. This leads to the 
use of the FIB as an imaging tool sometimes referred to as 
scanning ion microscopy. Secondary electrons produced 
with ions are referred to as ion induced secondary electrons 
(iSE). FIB columns are all equipped with one or more iSE 
detectors with the most common one being the ET detector 
as used in the SEM. iSE imaging has some advantages over SE 
imaging in the SEM.&nbsp; First, the ion beam produces many 
more SEs per incident particle than does a similar current 
electron beam resulting in a high signal, low noise image. 
Also, it is interesting to note that the iSE signal collected in a 
FIB is free of the backscattered electron component that 
reduces contrast in electron beam induced SE images. iSE 
imaging of surfaces shows topographical contrast that is 
familiar to anyone who has operated an SEM. iSE imaging of 
crystalline samples can produce very striking high contrast 
grain images due to the higher propensity for ions to channel 
along specific crystal planes resulting in a varying iSE yield as 
a function of grain orientation.
</p>
<p>During ion imaging of a sample there are other signals 
produced that are of limited use. The interaction with the 
sample causes secondary ions to be ejected from the sample. 
These can be used to form images. However there are few 
secondary ions produced as compared to the iSE and there-
fore the signals tend to be noisy requiring either longer scan 
times or higher beam currents to be used, both of which will 
result in increased levels of sample damage during imaging.
</p>
<p>Resolution of scanning ion microscope images is not just a 
function of the beam size that is generated by the ion column. 
The ultimate resolution of a scanning ion image is a convolu-
tion of the beam size and some measure of the rate at which 
the sample is milled. Resolution is worse for materials that mill 
quickly and better for those materials that have a slower sput-
ter rate (Orloff et&nbsp;al. 1996, 2003). Just like the SEM, as the cur-
rent in the probe is increased, the beam size increases. 
. Figure&nbsp;30.4 shows spot burns from an LMIS (Ga) column 
</p>
<p>where the ion beam is put in spot mode and left stationary so 
that the substrate is milled away. The beam size is then some 
measure of the size of the spot including the halos around the 
milled area as ion beams suffer significant aberrations as occur 
with lenses in the SEM.&nbsp; In both the LMIS and the plasma 
cases, the ion columns are capable of producing symmetric 
ion beams with the exception that at the larger currents vari-
ous optical aberrations become dominating and result in a less 
well defined ion beams.
</p>
<p>The collection of secondary ions requires an additional 
detector that is sensitive to secondary ions and can reject the 
signal produced by the secondary electrons. These secondary 
ion detectors are often now optional on modern instruments. 
. Figure&nbsp; 30.5 is a comparison between secondary electron 
imaging induced by electrons and secondary ion imaging 
induced by ion scanning. The sample consists of a tungsten 
wire and a human hair. The electron image shows good surface 
detail, but the uncoated hair is charging and the surface infor-
mation is somewhat obscured. The secondary ion image shows 
no charging artifacts on the human hair but also shows an 
increased level of surface detail due to the small escape length 
of the secondary ions. One must always remember that imag-
ing with ions will always cause some level of damage within the 
sample (Giannuzzi 2006; Mayer 2007; Michael 2011).
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;30.6 is an electron-induced secondary electron 
(SE) image of free-machining brass coated with layers of Cu, 
Ni, and Au. Note that free-machining brass contains particles 
of Pb. . Figure&nbsp;30.6 shows the contrast that we have come to 
expect from electron beam induced SE imaging. The higher 
atomic number regions appear brighter as a result of higher 
secondary electron yield that results from the SE

. Figure&nbsp;30.7 is an iSE image (30&nbsp;kV Ga) of the identical area

because the ion channeling contrast is quite strong and the 
grain structure of each layer is revealed. It can also be 
observed that the Pb region and the Au layer are no longer

<p>bright relative to the brass as in . Fig.&nbsp; 30.6. . Figure&nbsp; 30.7 
demonstrates that the iSE yield is not a simple function of the 
target atomic number (Joy and Michael 2014). Also, 
. Fig.&nbsp;30.7 demonstrates the very strong grain contrast that 
can be observed in many crystalline materials. This grain 
contrast is due to the way that the crystallography of the sam-
ple impacts the penetration depth of the primary beam ions 
and therefore the iSE yield. Small changes in the ion beam 
incident angle can change the grain contrast that is observed. 
Thus, if you are trying to determine the nature of the contrast 
that is observed in a crystalline sample it is a simple matter to 
tilt the sample 2&ndash;4&deg; and observe how the contrast changes. If 
the contrast is due to ion channeling then the contrast 
between grains should change (Giannuzzi and Michael 2013).

<p>30.5  Preparation of&nbsp;Samples for&nbsp;SEM
</p>
<p>FIB&ndash;based sample preparation for SEM is a large field due to 
the versatility of modern SEMs and the many techniques that 
are utilized. One of the most common uses of FIB is for sub-
tractive processing of the sample in that the FIB is used to

<p>sputter site specific regions of the sample to produce cross 
sections. It is also common to produce samples that are 
manipulated from the bulk for study. One example is the 
extraction and production of thin samples for transmission 
Kikuchi diffraction as discussed in module 29 on electron 
backscatter diffraction. FIB has become an indispensable 
tool in the production of electron transparent samples for 
STEM/TEM and now the FIB can produce samples that are 
sufficiently thin for transmission imaging in the SEM at 
30&nbsp;keV using the STEM-in-SEM technique. FIB sample prep-
aration is applicable to many materials classes that are imaged 
in the SEM including polymers, metal, semiconductors, and 
ceramics.
</p>
<p>30.5.1  Cross-Section Preparation
</p>
<p>In materials characterization it is often of interest to image a 
section of the sample that is not visible from a planar section. 
In this case, the FIB is used to mill away material to expose a 
cross sectional view of the sample, as shown schematically in 
. Fig.&nbsp;30.8. There are many ways to accomplish this and in 
many modern FIB tools this process is fully automated and 
the user must simply indicate where the cross section is to be 
made. The following example will show the steps that are 
needed for a cross section to be produced.
</p>
<p>As was discussed earlier, any time the sample is exposed 
to the ion beam damage will occur. It is necessary to image 
the sample during preparation so the easiest way to eliminate 
the damage to the sample from the beam is to place a protec-
tive layer over the area to be cross sectioned. FIB tools come 
</p>
<p>equipped with gas injectors that can be used during sample 
preparation. Common precursor gasses used can deposit 
tungsten, platinum, or carbon. Each of these materials works 
quite well to protect the region of interest from the ion beam. 
The precursor gasses are delivered to the sample surface 
through a small needle that is placed in very close proximity 
to the area of interest. Either the ion beam or the electron 
beam can be scanned over the area of interest. Some of the 
gas molecules that are delivered through the needle absorb 
on to the sample surface where combined action of the pri-
mary beam (electron or ion) and the secondary electrons 
produced by the interaction of the beam with the sample 
decomposes the absorbed gas. This leaves behind a deposit 
that contains the desired material but also includes the ion 
beam species (if ions were used) and some residual organics 
from the precursor. Due to the short range of ions in materi-
als, the protective layer need not be very thick; but typically 
most applications use about 1&nbsp;μm to provide protection and 
for ease of subsequent milling of the sample. . Figure&nbsp; 30.9 
shows a cross section produced in a sulfide copper test cou-
pon where the objective of the experiment was to measure 
the rate of sulfide growth in accelerated aging conditions. The 
first step (. Fig.&nbsp;30.9a) is to deposit the protective platinum 
layer on the area to be sectioned. The goal is to have the com-
pleted cross section positioned under the platinum protec-
tive layer. A coarse first cut is made with a large current ion 
beam, the result of which is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;30.9b. Although 
the cross section is relatively clean at this point it is not ade-
quate for quality SEM imaging. Further polishing of the cross 
section is completed with lower current ion beams in this 
case . Fig.&nbsp;30.9c was completed with a 1-nA ion beam and 
. Fig.&nbsp;30.9d is the cross section after final polishing with a 
300- pA ion beam. The total time to produce this cross sec-
tion is about 20&nbsp;min. The completed cross section imaged at 
higher resolution is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;30.10. Note that all of the 
important microstructural features are easily observed in this 
very smooth polished cross section.
</p>
<p>FIB prepared surfaces can be very smooth and nearly fea-
tureless. The relative brightness between different materials 
can often provide sufficient image contrast. Materials con-
trast by itself may be insufficient and a method to enhance 
the contrast may be needed. One way to do this is to intro-
duce gasses near the sample that react with the ion beam and 
the sample surface to etch the FIB polished surface. One 
chemical that does this for semiconductor devices is trifluor-
acetic acid (TFA) that etches oxides and nitrides preferen-
tially to silicon and metals. . Figure&nbsp;30.11 demonstrates the 
use of TFA for enhancing the contrast in FIB milled surfaces. 
The sample was prepared using standard cross sectioning 
procedures in the FIB.&nbsp;After cross sectioning the sample was 
rotated and tilted so that the milled surface was normal to the 
ion beam. A low beam current is selected and then the gas is 
introduced through a fine needle while the ion beam is 
scanned over the milled surface. While milling, the sample 
image provides an etching progress monitor so that the etch-
ing progress can be terminated when the correct degree of 
etching has been achieved.

<p>SEM applications of FIB sample preparation can also uti-
lize samples that have been removed from the bulk material. 
This is generally done when the research requires EDS, EBSD, 
or STEM-in-SEM to be conducted as each of these techniques 
will not work optimally with standard cross sections (Prasad 
et&nbsp;al. 2003). Lift-out samples are made by milling trenches on 
both sides of the area of interest after a protective layer was 
deposited. The FIB beam is used to cut the sample free from 
the bulk material and then it can either be polished in the 
trench or lifted out to a support grid for subsequent polishing 
and if needed thinning to an acceptable thickness. Figure&nbsp;30.12 
shows some of the steps required to lift-out a 150-μm-wide 
sample. This was accomplished with a Xe plasma FIB but the 
steps are the same for a Ga FIB. Ex situ lift-out was used to 
remove the sample from the bulk followed by attachment to 
the Cu support structure to allow safe handling of the sample. 
</p>
<p>Once the sample was attached to the support structure, final 
sample polishing was performed and the sample was ready 
for analysis. EBSD results obtained from the sample shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;30.12 are shown in . Fig.&nbsp;30.13. Note that the sample 
surface is nearly ideal for EBSD as the number of mis-indexed 
or not indexed pixels is quite low.
</p>
<p>This technique of sample lift-out is applicable to all imag-
ing and analysis modes in the SEM.&nbsp; Once the sample is 
mounted flat on a surface or a support structure it is in an 
ideal sample orientation for imaging with secondary elec-
trons of backscattered electrons. Lift-out samples also pro-
vide ideal sample orientations for EDS, WDS, or EBSD 
analysis. This is not true of cross sections that are milled into 
the bulk and not lifted out as access to the sample for some 
imaging and analysis techniques is not close to ideal depend-
ing on the particular FIB/SEM platform chosen (Giannuzzi 
2006).
</p>
<p>30.5.2  FIB Sample Preparation for&nbsp;3D 
Techniques and&nbsp;Imaging
</p>
<p>One of the truly important advances in FIB applications is 
the ability to automate the FIB operation and coordinate it 
with the SEM imaging or analysis using EDS or EBSD.&nbsp;This 
coordination allows the FIB column to be used to mill speci-
fied volumes from a sample face and then allow that same 
slice to be imaged or an analytical technique applied and 
then the process can be repeated. This is often referred to as 
serial sectioning. In this way a direct reconstruction (direct 
tomograph) of a 3D volume can be developed. One must 
always remember though that in this sort of work there is no 
ability to go back and start over unless a second suitable 
region is available. It is also important to remember the 
length scales that are practically reached with FIB methods. 
The typical area that can be accessed with LMIS-based FIB 
columns is 50&nbsp;μm wide by 10&nbsp;μm deep. The number of slices 
is limited by the operator&rsquo;s patience and the stability of the 
FIB/SEM being utilized.
</p>
<p>The first step is to deposit a protective layer over the entire 
region that is to be milled. This step is necessary, as discussed 
for single sections, to protect the sample region from damage 
by the ion beam. The larger the area to be sectioned, the 
larger the protective layer has to be and this deposition may 
be quite time consuming. Once the protective layer has been 
deposited, there are two ways to proceed with serial section-
ing and imaging. The easiest method is to simply produce a 
cross section of the sample, as described previously. The pol-
ished face is then used as the starting point of the sectioning. 
One must be very careful when doing this to ensure that the

<p>trench that is cut is sufficiently wide to prevent the accumula-
tion of redeposited material (material sputtered from the 
sample will often fill in the sides of the trench) from obscur-
ing the region of interest. Once the initial trench has been 
prepared, the FIB/SEM can be set in automatic mode to pro-
ceed with the milling and imaging operations. This method is 
best used for imaging modes of operation (backscatter or 
secondary electron imaging) only as the access to the milled 
sample surface is limited. The resulting take-off angle for 
EDS in this mode is often sub-optimal, although good EDS 
spectrum imaging results have been obtained in this manner 
(Kotula et&nbsp;al. 2006).
</p>
<p>. Figure&nbsp;30.14 is an example of the first method of serial 
sectioning where a volume of interest is imaged in the center 
of a sample. The sample is an electroplated coating on a sub-
strate. The serial sectioning was accomplished by sequentially 
milling the exposed cross section followed by imaging with 
secondary electrons with the SEM column. . Figure&nbsp; 30.14a 
contains examples of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; images obtained from the slic-
ing and imaging process. The remaining images shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 30.14b, c are obtained after the individual slices are 
</p>
<p>aligned and stacked followed by the user selecting the planes 
of interest for image reconstruction.
</p>
<p>A much faster method requires the volume of interest to be 
milled using any means into a cantilever-like beam that is then 
sliced starting at the free end. This method has numerous 
advantages over the bulk sample method as there is much eas-
ier access to the sample for imaging and analysis. This can also 
be accomplished by milling a chunk that contains the region of 
interest from the sample and then mounting the chunk onto a 
suitable support structure. The chunk then represents the can-
tilevered beam sample and is sequentially milled from the free 
side of the sample. This method is faster as much less material 
needs to be removed for each slice and there is no issue with 
re-deposition of the sputtered material. . Figure&nbsp;30.15 shows 
an example of the cantilever beam method for serial section-
ing through a tin whisker on a copper substrate. In this case it 
was important to first protect the whisker with electron beam 
deposited platinum followed by ion beam deposited platinum. 
Once the feature of interest is protected from the ion beam, the 
material around the whisker is removed so that actual section-
ing time during the serial sectioning will be minimized. EBSD 
orientation maps were collected at every slice during serial 
sectioning. Some commercially available FIB/SEMs require 
the sample to be repositioned for EBSD and then FIB slicing, 
while others possess a geometry where the sample does not 
have to be moved between sectioning and analytical acquisi-
tions. For systems requiring movement between sectioning 
and EBSD, accurate alignment using fiducial marks is manda-
tory. . Figure&nbsp; 30.16 is a reconstruction of the EBSD maps 
obtained from the tin whisker shown in . Fig.&nbsp;30.15. This data 
was acquired with a 200-nm slice thickness and an EBSD step 
size of 200&nbsp;nm, leading to a voxel dimension of 200 &times; 200 &times; 
200&nbsp;nm. The acquisition required 75 sections that required a 
total time of 48 h to section and collect the EBSD data. Once 
this data is obtained and aligned and reconstructed then fur-
ther examination of the spatial relationships between grains 
and the whisker are possible leading to an improved under-
standing of whisker growth.

<p>30.6  Summary
</p>
<p>The combination of FIB and SEM is now an established and 
important technique for materials and biological sample 
preparation and has enable precise site specific samples to be 
produced. LMIS sources (mostly Ga) and plasma sources 
(mostly Xe) have been developed. The LMIS-equipped FIB 
tools produce much smaller probes that allow more precise 
sectioning due to a smaller probe size with higher current 
densities while the plasma FIB tools are finding application 
where large amounts of material need to be removed effi-
ciently. The applications of FIB include sample preparation 
for imaging with electrons and ions and for a variety of ana-
lytical techniques including EBSD and EDS.

<p>Electron beams have made possible the development of the 
versatile, high performance electron microscopes described 
in the earlier chapters of this book. Techniques for the gen-
eration and application of electron beams are now well doc-
umented and understood, and a wide variety of images and 
data can be produced using readily available instruments. 
While the scanning electron microscope (SEM) is the most 
widely used tool for high performance imaging and micro-
analysis, it is not the only option and may not even always 
be the best instrument to choose to solve a particular prob-
lem. In this chapter we will discuss how, by replacing the 
beam of electrons with a beam of ions, it is possible to pro-
duce a high performance microscope which resembles an 
SEM in many respects and shares some of its capabilities 
but which also offers additional and important modes of 
operation.
</p>
<p>31.1  What Is So&nbsp;Useful About Ions?
</p>
<p>The smallest object or feature that can be imaged by any opti-
cal instrument is determined by the diameter &ldquo;δ&rdquo; of the 
smallest spot of illumination that can be directed on to a 
specimen. As first shown by Fresnel (1817, 1826), this param-
eter &ldquo;δ&rdquo; is found to be
</p>
<p>d l a= k /( )
 
</p>
<p>(31.1)
</p>
<p>where λ is the wavelength of the emitted beam, k is a con-
stant of the order of unity, and α is the convergence angle of 
the beam and so cannot exceed π/2 radians (i.e., 90&deg;). In 
practice α must usually be chosen to be much smaller than 
π/2&nbsp; in magnitude to minimize the effects of aberrations in 
the imaging lenses of the microscope. Consequently, an SEM 
operating in the energy range 10 keV to 30 keV will gener-
ally only offer a limiting resolution of the order of 1&nbsp;nm, even 
under the very best conditions. Although as noted elsewhere 
in this volume, further improvements in high resolution 
SEM can be achieved by advanced electron optical engineer-
ing, this requires complex and expensive aberration correc-
tion schemes. The constraints imposed on the minimum 
convergence angle that can be used result in a high resolu-
tion SEM image that has inevitable limitations on the achiev-
able depth of field, which is typically only tens of nanometers 
or worse. Fortunately this performance limitation can now 
be overcome by using a beam of ions rather than of 
electrons.
</p>
<p>Ions are much more massive than electrons, so at any 
given energy their wavelength λ is significantly shorter, as 
shown in . Fig.&nbsp;31.1. For example, at an energy of 10&nbsp;keV the 
wavelength of an electron is 0.012&nbsp; nm, but for the same 
energy a hydrogen (H+) ion has a wavelength that is smaller 
than the electron wavelength by a factor of 43. A helium ion 
</p>
<p>has a wavelength that is 86&times; smaller, so potentially offering  
a beam spot of a few picometers (pm), and making  
correspondingly enhanced image resolution possible. 
. Figure&nbsp;31.2a shows an example of high resolution electron 
and He+ imaging of gold islands on carbon with conditions 
optimized for SEM (i.e., low beam energy) and HIM (high 
beam energy). The extraordinary fine-scale detail that can be 
obtained with HIM imaging of Au on C is shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;31.2b. . Figure&nbsp;31.3 shows a more challenging imaging 
problem, that of soft material, as viewed by the SEM in the 
&ldquo;conventional&rdquo; beam energy range and by HIM, where much 
finer details are visible in the ion beam image.
</p>
<p>An additional benefit of ion beam imaging is that because 
the ion beam wavelengths λ are so short it is possible to sig-
nificantly reduce the convergence angle α of the ion beam, 
thus extending the imaging depth of field by a factor of 1/α, 
while still offering a much superior resolution. . Figure&nbsp;31.4a 
shows an example of the large depth of field that can be 
achieved simultaneously with wide field-of-view. Unlike high 
resolution SEM images, which are essentially two- 
dimensional because of the poor depth of field, high resolu-
tion ion beam images can also offer three-dimensional 
information, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 31.4b, where the depth of 
field is at least 1.5&nbsp;μm for 1-μm image width. . Figure&nbsp;31.5 
illustrates the value of this combination of high resolution 
and high depth of field in ion beam imaging by revealing 
details throughout an image of a complex three-dimensional 
specimen of human pancreatic cells.
</p>
<p>All electrons are the same&mdash;but all ions are not, and so 
many different ion-based microscopes can be configured and 
optimized for the various tasks. At present the most widely 
used ion beam for high resolution imaging is helium (He+),

<p>while gallium (Ga+) is widely used for ion beam machining of 
materials. Historically the earliest ion beam microscope (Levi-
Setti 1974) used protons (H+), while more recently argon 
(Ar+), neon (Ne+), and lithium (Li+) beams have all also been 
put into use for nanoscale imaging and fabrication. At present 
negatively charged ions are much less widely employed than 
the corresponding positive species, but it can be safely antici-
pated that they will eventually be employed for special pur-
poses because of the additional versatility that they can offer.
</p>
<p>Although in principle any ion could be employed for 
microscopy, using a heavier ion requires a correspondingly 
</p>
<p>higher accelerating voltage to operate than does a lighter ion, 
and this heavy ion bombardment may cause significantly 
more damage to the specimen under examination. Heavy 
ions also usually have multiple ionization states and these 
may result in emitted beams whose incident energy is effec-
tively distributed across several values spanning a wide 
range. This energy spread, in turn, may result in chromatic 
aberrations in the lenses which may then further degrade the 
achievable resolution.
</p>
<p>In addition, while all energetic ions cause sputtering of 
the target atoms to some degree and also implant into the

</p>
<p>target, which can locally alter the target composition, ions of 
higher mass, such as Ga+ and above, have higher sputtering 
rates that may substantially alter the target. While acceptable 
for some tasks such as thinning or machining materials, the 
level of damage per incident heavy ion is undesirable for 
imaging purposes because such significant local alteration 
occurs that the fine spatial details of the specimen are lost 
before an image representative of the original material can be 
successfully captured.
</p>
<p>31.2  Generating Ion Beams
</p>
<p>The approach now most commonly employed for producing 
a beam of ions for use in microscopy is a development of the 
method originally employed by Prof. Erwin Muller at Penn 
State University in the 1940s and 1950s (Muller 1965). 
Muller&rsquo;s device was a sealed metal cylinder containing helium 
gas which was cooled to a temperature of just a few degrees 
Kelvin (K). At one end of the cylinder was a sharply pointed 
metal needle connected to a power supply capable of sup-
porting a positive voltage of up to a few kilovolts, while at the 
other end was a fluorescent imaging screen. When neutral 
helium atoms drifted towards the needle they became 
</p>
<p>ionized due to the high electric field gradient and acquired a 
positive potential which then resulted in them being acceler-
ated away from the tip and towards the viewing screen where 
they formed into an image. On October 11, 1955, Muller and 
his students were able to demonstrate for the first time ever 
the direct observation of an atomic structure. Almost 20 
years later Professor Riccardo Levi-Setti of the University of 
Chicago developed a modification of Muller&rsquo;s ion source 
which allowed it to generate ion beams that could be focused, 
scanned, and used for imaging in the same way as electrons 
in a conventional SEM (Levi-Setti 1974). It was this develop-
ment that became the basis for the source for the present 
helium ion microscope (HIM).
</p>
<p>In present-day ion beam microscopes, the emitter is once 
again fabricated into the form of a needle, but now the exact 
size and shape of this tip is very carefully optimized. Using 
patented, and proprietary, procedures developed by the Zeiss 
company the emitter tip is shaped and sharpened until it con-
tains just three atoms (Notte et&nbsp;al. 2006). This &ldquo;trimer&rdquo; con-
figuration is inherently more stable than any more random 
arrangement and also ensures that the maximum emitted ion 
current is directed parallel to the axis of the ion beam. A 
carefully placed, moveable aperture can then be used to select 
any one of the three &ldquo;trimer&rdquo; ion emission peaks to be used as 
the beam source for the instrument. The available ion beam 
current varies with the magnitude of the helium, or other gas, 
pressure and can reach values as high of several hundred 
picoamperes.
</p>
<p>Low energy ions, i.e., those with less than about 1&nbsp;MeV of 
energy, are not significantly affected by magnetic fields so all 
of the lenses must be electrostatic in type rather than mag-
netic. The ion beam then travels along the microscope col-
umn until it reaches the specimen where its interaction 
generates ion-induced secondary electrons (iSE) as well as, in 
some cases, other signals. The ion emitter is adequately stable 
and provides a bright signal for periods from 5&ndash;10 h before 
the emitter needs to be re-optimized. Once the available 
beam current becomes too low in intensity, or too unstable to 
be useful, then the tip must be reformed. This can be done in 
situ by the operator using an automated procedure which 
takes some 10&ndash;20&nbsp;min to complete.
</p>
<p>Changing from the familiar He+ beam to a Ne+ beam, or 
to some other source of emission, requires that any residual 
gas in the chamber must be first pumped away. The desired 
new gas of choice can then be injected into the chamber, and 
the system can be brought back into operation by reforming 
the &ldquo;trimer&rdquo; as described earlier. The usable overall lifetime 
of these emitters is typically of the order of many months 
when they are treated with reasonable care and attention.

<p>SEM, to fully optimize the performance of the HIM it is nec-
essary to pay more attention to certain details. The ion source 
offers just two adjustable controls&mdash;the &ldquo;extractor&rdquo; which 
determines the field at the tip and so controls the emission of 
the source, and the &ldquo;accelerator&rdquo; which determines the land-
ing energy of the beam on to the specimen surface. The 
extractor module &ldquo;floats&rdquo; on the top of the potential deter-
mined by the accelerator setting, and both the brightness and 
the stability of the ion source are affected by the extractor 
module settings. As the extractor potential is increased, the 
emission current rises before reaching a plateau at the so- 
called &ldquo;best imaging voltage&rdquo; (BIV), which for helium ions 
occurs at a field strength of about 44&nbsp;V/nm depending on the 
geometry of the tip itself. Exceeding the BIV will make the 
beam less stable, and can result in so much damage to the 
emitter that it may become necessary to reform the tip again 
before reliable operation can be restored. The &ldquo;accelerator&rdquo; 
control determines the actual landing energy of the ions on 
the specimen. For a He+ beam this energy is usually in the 
range 25&ndash;45&nbsp;keV while for a heavier ion such as Ne+ the cor-
responding value is more typically in the 20&ndash;35-keV range. 
In either case the yield of secondary electrons increases with 
the accelerator setting, but continuous operation with the 
system at energies of 45&nbsp;keV or higher may cause problems 
such as insulator breakdowns and discharges. It is therefore 
good practice to record and save all the experimental param-
eters likely to be encountered.
</p>
<p>31.3  Signal Generation in&nbsp;the&nbsp;HIM
</p>
<p>Energetic electrons and ions travel through solid materials 
while undergoing elastic and inelastic scattering events 
until they either deposit all of their initial energy and come 
to a halt, or are re-emitted from a sample surface and sub-
sequently escape while generating secondary electrons and 
backscattered electrons or ions as they leave. Every such 
beam particle trajectory is unique and so it is not possible 
to predict in advance how deep, or how far, any particular 
incident ion or electron might travel. Examples of Monte 
Carlo simulations for ion beam trajectories are shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp;31.6.
</p>
<p>The most probable depth reached by the beam, and the 
horizontal spread of the beam, can both be estimated using 
the formula developed by Kanaya and Okayama (1972) 
which assumes that the range R depends only on the incident 
energy E of the incident particle and the density ρ of the 
material through which the beam is traveling. The &ldquo;K&ndash;O&rdquo; 
range is then given as
</p>
<p>R E /p
K O-
</p>
<p>= k r
 
</p>
<p>(31.2)
</p>
<p>where R
K-O
</p>
<p> is the beam range (in nm), ρ is the density of the 
target material (in g/cm3), k is a constant depending on the 
choice of particle, i.e., electrons or ions, and P is a scaling 
constant. For example, when using a helium ion beam then

<p>κ = 80&nbsp;nm, and P = 0.72, so the range versus density plot has 
the form shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 31.7 which also shows the corre-

</p>

 for electrons. In the energy range most likely 
</p>
<p>to be of interest, the majority of the emitted secondary signal 
under electron bombardment from any material of interest 
most likely comes from the SE
</p>
<p>2
 component of the signal, i.e., 
</p>
<p>it is generated by backscattered electrons as they exit through 
the sample surface with reduced resolution compared to the 
SE
</p>
<p>1
 component produced by the incident beam. By compari-
</p>
<p>son the beam range of He+ ions is not only much shorter than 
the corresponding electron range but also increases more 
slowly with energy. The iSE yield is typically three to five 
times larger than the comparable electron-excited SE values 
and mostly consists of the high resolution SE
</p>
<p>1
 generated by 
</p>
<p>the incident ion beam with little or no SE
2
 component to 
</p>
<p>degrade the resolution. Secondary electrons have often been 
considered to be of limited value and for modest resolution 
use only, but recent work (e.g., Zhu et&nbsp;al. 2009) has shown 
that, to the contrary, the secondary electron signal is a 
uniquely powerful tool. The SE signal can efficiently capture 
and display imaging information ranging in scale from mil-
limeters all the way down to single atoms, and even to the 
subatomic range, providing the incident beam footprint can 
be made small enough.
</p>
<p>As shown by Bethe (1930, 1933) the generation rate 
N(SE) of secondary electrons by energetic ions or electrons 
depends on the instantaneous magnitude of the electron 
stopping power (&minus;dE/dS) of the beam, so
</p>
<p>N SE / . E / s( ) ( ) ( )= - 1 d de
 
</p>
<p>(31.3 )
</p>
<p>where ε is a constant whose value depends on the target 
material, E is the instantaneous energy of the incident 
charged particle, and s is the distance travelled along the 
trajectory. The ion-generated SE yield is always larger than 
the corresponding SE yield from electrons because ions 
deposit their energy much more rapidly, and much closer to 
the surface, than electrons can do. The effect of changing 
the beam energy on the limiting imaging performance 
based upon the secondary electron yield is also different in 
the electron and ion cases. For an SEM operating in the 
conventional beam energy range above 10&nbsp; keV, SE image 
quality does not improve very much with beam energy 
because the effect of increasing the beam brightness is 
mostly offset by the fall in the SE yield with increasing 
energy. For ion beams however, raising the beam energy 
increases both the yield of ions from the gun and the stop-
ping power of the target which increases the generation rate 
of the iSE, both of which effects contribute to improved SE 
imaging performance.
</p>
<p>Based on these ideas it is now possible to predict how the 
emitted yield of secondary electrons for a given material will 
vary for both ion and electron generation. The SE generation 
rate at a given depth in the sample varies as the stopping 
power at that point and which is in turn a function of the 
velocity of the incoming particle. Secondary electrons which 
are generated beneath the specimen surface must diffuse 
back to the surface before they can be detected. The yield of 
iSE which reach the surface and so could escape is then pre-
dicted to be
</p>
<p>Yield 0.5 exp / SE= -* ( )z l  
(31.4)
</p>
<p>where λ
SE
</p>
<p> is the appropriate mean free path range for second-
ary electrons, and z is the distance from the generation point 
to the nearest exit surface. Detailed predictions of iSE yields 
can now be made based on this model; see, for example, 
Ramachandra et&nbsp;al. (2009) and Dapore (2011). The magni-
tude, and the form, of the iSE yield curves varies with the 
energy of the incident beam, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp;31.8 for Si, as 
well as with the choice of beam and target material. For a 
helium beam and a carbon target the iSE yield reaches a max-
imum value of about 4 which is achieved at a He + energy of 
750&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;For a gold target the iSE yield peaks at a value of 6.4 
and at an energy of about 1000&nbsp;keV.&nbsp;The details of these iSE 
yield curves vary with the choice of both the incident ion and 
the target material. For example, when using H+ as the beam 
of choice the iSE signal reaches its maximum yield of 1.7 at 
an energy of only about 100&nbsp;keV, while for an Ar+ beam the 
iSE yield reaches its maximum yield, which is in excess of 50, 
at an energy of 30&nbsp; MeV.&nbsp; Simulations make it possible to 
determine how to optimize resolution, maximize contrast, 
and minimize damage.

<p>31.4  Current Generation and&nbsp;Data 
Collection in&nbsp;the&nbsp;HIM
</p>
<p>A typical ion beam microscope operates at energies selected 
between 10 and 35&nbsp;keV, and generates an incident beam cur-
rent of the order of 0.1 pA to &gt;100 pA at the specimen. These 
ions interact with the specimen of interest generating an iSE 
secondary electron signal which can be collected by an 
Everhart&ndash;Thornley (ET) detector very similar to that used in 
the conventional SEM.&nbsp;The signal is then passed through an 
&ldquo;analog to digital&rdquo; (A/D) convertor for real-time display and 
for storage. Because the incident ion beam currents are quite 
low, the A/D convertor, which samples the incoming iSE sig-
nal at a fixed repetition period of 100&nbsp;ns, will likely completely 
miss many of these sparsely generated signal pulses. To over-
come this problem, an additional image control labeled as 
&ldquo;image intensity&rdquo; (II) has been added to the familiar SEM 
brightness and contrast controls. This &ldquo;image intensity&rdquo; con-
trol allows the operator to choose between (a) the true aver-
aging mode in which N successive A/D conversions are made 
and the total yield is then divided by N and (b) the true inte-
gration mode in which N successive A/D conversions are 
summed and that value is then reported, or any arbitrary set-
ting between these two extremes. (J. Notte 2015, personal 
communication). The addition of this illumination control 
provides considerable additional imaging flexibility while 
ensuring that the usual &ldquo;brightness&rdquo; and &ldquo;contrast&rdquo; controls 
are still able to determine the overall appearance of the image.
</p>
<p>In practice, operating the HIM is generally similar to 
operating an SEM, but the HIM achieves superior image res-
olution and contrast. The small beam probe diameter and the 
much enlarged depth of field together produce highly 
detailed images of even the most complicated three dimen-
sional structures, as shown in . Fig.&nbsp; 31.9 for Ga-ion-beam 
etched directionally-solidified Al-Cu eutectic alloy. The 
</p>
<p>limited penetration of the ion beam into materials provides 
highly detailed images of surface, and near-surface features 
are visible in HIM images that would likely never be evident 
in a conventional SEM image.
</p>
<p>The strategy for operating the HIM is different than that of 
a conventional SEM because the incident beam energy is gen-
erally held fixed at the highest possible energy, typically in the 
range 30&ndash;40&nbsp;keV, because this simultaneously optimizes both 
the signal-to-noise ratio and the image resolution. When there 
is a requirement to examine sub-surface detail this can best be 
achieved by exploiting the inevitable removal of surface layers 
by the ion beam as it &ldquo;rasters&rdquo; across the sample. Material can 
then be removed at the rate of a few tens of nanometers per 
minute, with images stored every few seconds to yield a full 
three-dimensional reconstruction of the sampled volume.
</p>
<p>Charging is an inevitable problem for the HIM.&nbsp;The high 
SE coefficient of ion beams tends to cause positive charging at 
the surface, which is further exacerbated by the positive 
charge injected by the positive He+ ions. The simplest and 
most reliable technique to control such positive charging is to 
periodically flood the specimen surface with a very low energy 
electron beam so as to re-establish charge balance before 
starting the next scan, although this approach requires care to 
eliminate both under- and over-compensation. An alternative 
approach is to inject air into the specimen chamber through a 
small jet positioned just a short distance away from the desired 
sample region. This is easy to implement and requires little 
supervision once an initial charge balance has been achieved.

<p>imaging (RBI)&rdquo; (Rutherford 1911). Some fraction of the inci-
dent ion beam is deflected though an angle greater than 90&deg; 
as a result of high angle elastic scattering events. This elastic 
scattering generates a signal carrying information about the 
crystalline geometry and the orientation of the specimen. An 
example of the Ni-Sn reaction zone at an interface between 
Ni and Sn to form intermetallic compounds as imaged with 
backscattered He ions is shown in . Fig.&nbsp;31.10. The RBI sig-
nal increases in magnitude as a function of the atomic num-
ber of the target material, but is also affected by a periodic 
variation of the RBI signal in which the signal falls to a much 
lower intensity whenever the outer shell of electrons is filled. 
This behavior occurs at the atomic numbers 2, 8, 18, and son 
on, and so rather restricts the quantitative utility of this mode 
as an analytical tool.
</p>
<p>When ions travel through a crystalline material they may 
experience &ldquo;channeling contrast,&rdquo; which is a variation in the 
signal level that is dependent on the orientation of any cur-
rently placed crystalline target material to the incident beam. 
When using a helium ion beam, signal variations of 40 % or 
more in magnitude can be obtained in this way so producing 
highly visible maps of sample crystallography, as shown in 
. Fig.&nbsp; 31.11 for a polycrystalline copper sample. A similar 
effect also occurs for electrons but the corresponding con-
trast is an order-of-magnitude smaller at approximately 
2&ndash;5 %. The utility of this mode of operation for analytical 
purposes is enhanced by the fact that the convergence angle 
</p>
<p>of the ion beam itself is also one to two orders of magnitude 
smaller than for an electron beam making it readily possible 
to retrieve crystal orientation data from regions at the bot-
tom of trenches and holes while still having adequate signal 
intensity with which to work.
</p>
<p>31.5  Patterning with&nbsp;Ion Beams
</p>
<p>When ions strike a target they always remove a finite amount 
of material from the top surface by the process called &ldquo;sput-
tering,&rdquo; which involves ion-atom collisions that dislodge 
atoms and transfer sufficient kinetic energy so that a small 
fraction escape the sample. While this is sometimes a prob-
lem when imaging is the main application of a microscope, 
the ability of ion beams to remove material in a controlled 
fashion from a surface is of considerable and increasing 
value. At its simplest this capability can be applied to gener-
ate simple structures such as arrays of holes, or to pattern 
substrates. The typical beam choice for this process is gallium 
because of its high sputtering coefficient, but residual gallium 
becomes embedded in the material being machined. Neon is 
also a useful candidate for the gas as it can remove material at 
about 60 % of the speed of gallium but without permanently 
depositing anything into the target material. For the very 
softest or most fragile materials a helium ion beam can also 
pattern at a slow but acceptable rate.
</p>
<p>An important current use of this technology relies on 
&ldquo;Graphene&rdquo; as the material of choice. Graphene comes in the

</p>
<p>31.6  Operating the&nbsp;HIM
</p>
<p>Using a He+, or some other, ion beam for imaging materials 
is somewhat different from, although not really much more 
complex than, conventional imaging with electrons. However 
some planning prior to turning on the ion beam will help by 
</p>
<p>minimizing beam damage optimizing conditions, and 
improving specimen throughput.
</p>
<p>31.7  Chemical Microanalysis with&nbsp;Ion 
Beams
</p>
<p>The ability of a microscope to image a material while simul-
taneously performing a chemical microanalysis of the mate-
rial is of great value in all areas of science and technology. As 
a result a high percentage of all SEMs are equipped with 
X-ray detectors for the identification and analysis of speci-
men composition. However, X-ray generation is only possi-
ble when the velocity of the incoming charged particle 
(electrons or ions) equals or exceeds the velocity of the orbit-
ing electron within the sample. For an incident beam of elec-
trons these two energies will only be numerically equal in 
value when their velocities are the same. When the kinetic 
energy of a beam electron matches the ionization (binding) 
energy of an atomic shell electron, inelastic scattering of the 
beam electron becomes possible, causing ejection of that 
atomic electron. But when the incident beam is made of 
helium ions, which have a mass 7300 times heavier than an 
electron, then the energy of the ion also has to be increased 
by a factor of 7300&times; by accelerating it before atomic ioniza-
tion becomes possible. X-ray microanalysis with an ion 
beam is therefore only possible with ion beam energies in 
the MeV range, which is far above the operating energy of 
the HIM.
</p>
<p>Possibly the most promising approach for chemical anal-
ysis using ion beams at present is Time of Flight- Secondary 
Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), which directly analyzes 
the specimen atoms sputtered atoms from the surface by the 
primary ion beam. In this method the specimen of interest is 
</p>
<p>Step 1
</p>
<p>Choose the initial ion beam to be employed. If only one 
</p>
<p>beam type is available, for example, Ga+, then this step is 
</p>
<p>not crucial because it should imply that the required 
</p>
<p>operating choices have already been optimized. 
</p>
<p>However, if several different ion beam species are 
</p>
<p>available then a planned strategy becomes necessary. If 
</p>
<p>there is only a limited amount of the sample then the 
</p>
<p>user should start with the softest ion beam available&mdash;
</p>
<p>helium&mdash;so as to minimize damage in the near-surface 
</p>
<p>region of the specimen&mdash;and image as required. Only 
</p>
<p>when this set of images is completed should a more 
</p>
<p>aggressive beam choice be tried.
</p>
<p>Step 2
</p>
<p>Select the desired beam energy. The best choice is always 
</p>
<p>the highest voltage available because this will enhance 
</p>
<p>image resolution, and the ion source will be running at its 
</p>
<p>optimum efficiency. Even at modestly high energies, for 
</p>
<p>example 45&nbsp;keV, the depth of penetration of ions into 
</p>
<p>most specimens will generally be less than that of a 
</p>
<p>conventional SEM operating at just a few hundred 
</p>
<p>electron volts. If the signal-to-noise of the image appears 
</p>
<p>to be good enough to record useful information then it is 
</p>
<p>worth trying to reduce the incident beam current by 
</p>
<p>using a smaller beam current in the column to see if the 
</p>
<p>damage rate of the sample can be reduced while 
</p>
<p>simultaneously increasing the imaging depth of field.
</p>
<p>Step 3
</p>
<p>Next choose a working distance (WD) from the source to the 
</p>
<p>sample. Obtaining the shortest possible WD is not as 
</p>
<p>important in an ion microscope as it is in a conventional SEM 
</p>
<p>because the aberrations of the ion beam-optical system are 
</p>
<p>much less severe than those in conventional electron optics. 
</p>
<p>Using a longer working distance will allow safer specimen 
</p>
<p>tilting and manipulation. Before proceeding also ensure that 
</p>
<p>the specimen stage and its specimens are not touching 
</p>
<p>anything else, nor obscuring access to the various detectors, 
</p>
<p>probes, and accessories in the column and chamber.
</p>
<p>Step 4
</p>
<p>If these are the first observations of the sample which is 
</p>
<p>now in the HIM, then try recording images from some 
</p>
<p>expendable region of the specimen at several different 
</p>
<p>magnifications and currents to confirm whether or not 
</p>
<p>ion- induced beam damage is going to be a problem. In 
</p>
<p>any case always start imaging at the lowest possible 
</p>
<p>magnification and work up from there. Working &ldquo;high to 
</p>
<p>low&rdquo; is likely to be unsatisfactory because the damage 
</p>
<p>induced at higher magnification will be obvious as the 
</p>
<p>magnification is reduced. Also check the imaged field of 
</p>
<p>view from time to time for signs of damage, or any 
</p>
<p>indications of drift.
</p>
<p>Step 5
</p>
<p>Maintain a constant check on the incident ion beam 
</p>
<p>current. If this is falling, or if the images are becoming 
</p>
<p>noisy and unstable, then the emitter tip should be 
</p>
<p>reformed before continuing.

<p>contained in the sample chamber in the usual way, but on one 
side of the chamber is a shutter which can be opened or 
closed at very high speed as required. The ion beam is then 
switched on for a short period of time, striking the specimen 
and sputtering the top two or three atomic layers of the speci-
men, including neutral, negative, and positive fragments and 
at the same time the shutter is opened. Which fragment of 
the sample, positive or negative, is to be analyzed is deter-
mined by the polarity of the electric field applied in the 
chamber. The chosen charged particles from the sample drift 
toward the shutter at which point they are abruptly acceler-
ated by a strong electric field and travel on until they reach 
the detector which records the time taken from the original 
electrical pulse. This time interval will depend on the mass as 
well as the charge of the particle and so by measuring the 
transit time required to reach the detector, the mass-to- 
charge ratio of each individual atom cluster can be deduced. 
Given accurate &ldquo;time of transit&rdquo; measurement capability on 
the system, this mass-to-charge ratio data can provide rapid, 
reliable, and unique identification of all the atomic and clus-
ter ions ejected during ion bombardment. After a suitable 
time interval the shutter is again closed, the system is briefly 
allowed to stabilize, and the operation is then repeated as 
often as required to achieve adequate statistics.
</p>
<p>TOF-SIMS offers some significant advantages over other 
possible approaches. The incident ion beam can either be 
held stationary at a point, or scanned across a chosen area as 
required to produce a chemical map. Each cycle of this pro-
cess will then physically remove a few atomic layers from the 
analyzed area, so repeated measurements on the same area 
can eventually provide a three-dimensional view of the sam-
pled region. Most important of all, this approach to analysis 
provides detailed information about the actual chemistry of 
</p>
<p>the area selected, identifying the chemistry of the various 
compounds, clusters, and elements that are present whereas 
conventional X-ray microanalysis can only identify which 
elements are present. This technology is presently only avail-
able on a few dual-beam Ga+ &ldquo;focused ion beam source&rdquo; 
(SEM&ndash;FIB) instruments, but many groups are now working 
to extend this capability to the HIM.

<p> z Abstract
</p>
<p>A collection of data comprising secondary and backscattered 
electron yields, measurements of electron stopping powers, 
and X-ray ionization cross sections has been assembled from 
published sources. Values are provided for both elements and 
many compounds, although the quality and quantity of the 
available data vary widely from one material to another. 
These compilations provide the basic framework for under-
standing and interpreting electron beam images in a quanti-
tative way&mdash;as is required for example in semiconductor 
device metrology&mdash;and also form a comprehensive source of 
experimental data for testing analytical and Monte Carlo 
models of electron beam interactions.
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>The year 1997 marked the one hundredth anniversary of the 
discovery of the electron. Within a year of that event Starke 
(1898) in Germany, and Campbell-Swinton (1899) in 
England, independently showed that electrons were back-
scattered from solid specimens and so made the first quanti-
tative measurements of the interaction of electrons with 
material. Over the century since then many dozens of papers 
have been published that contain information on various 
aspects of electron&ndash;solid interactions. Unfortunately no sys-
tematic collections of the results of such investigations appear 
to be available for any part of the field of electron microscopy 
and microanalysis. As a result, anyone requiring a specific 
piece of data&mdash;such as the backscattering yield of molybde-
num at 15&nbsp;keV, or the secondary electron yield from gallium 
</p>
<p>arsenide at 3&nbsp; keV to take two random examples&mdash;has no 
option but to search the literature in the hope of finding a 
value which must then, in the absence of any other compa-
rable evidence, be taken as correct. What is required is a 
source which collects and collates all the values available so 
as to provide the user with not only a value, but some indica-
tion as to its likely reliability.
</p>
<p> Structure of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Database
</p>
<p>The database presented here is an attempt to present as com-
plete a survey as possible of the published results on back-
scattering yields, secondary electron yields, stopping powers, 
X-ray ionization cross sections, and fluorescent yields. 
Computer-aided literature searches have been conducted to 
try and find all published references in this general area for 
the period from 1898 to the present day. Clearly no claim can 
be made as to the completeness of any such search, and it is 
perhaps to be hoped that some major body of work has been 
overlooked because, as discussed below, there are otherwise 
major omissions in the materials available.
</p>
<p>The rules for the data included in this collection are simple:
 (a) Only experimental results are included. Values that are 
</p>
<p>not specifically indicated by the author(s) as being 
experimental, or values that are clearly the result of 
interpolation, extrapolation, or curve fitting, have been 
expunged.
</p>
<p> (b) No attempt has been made to critically assess the 
accuracy or precision of the data, nor to remove any 
results on the basis of their presumed quality.
</p>
<p> (c) Values have been tabulated primarily for the energy 
range up to 30&nbsp;keV, although data points for incident 
energies up to 100&nbsp;keV have been included where they 
are available.
</p>
<p>The decision not to engage in any judgment of the quality of 
any of the sets of results may seem to be a significant draw-
back to the utility of the database. However, until so much 
data has been collated for each element or compound that 
rogue values can infallibly be distinguished and eliminated, 
there is no criterion on which to reject any particular result. 
Further it is conceivable that two tabulated values of a given 
parameter may differ substantially and yet still both be of 
value. This is because of an inherent contradiction in the 
nature of the measurements that are being made. A mea-
surement made in a UHV electron scattering machine with 
in situ sample cleaning and baking facilities will naturally be 
more &ldquo;reliable&rdquo; than a measurement made inside a typical 
scanning electron microscope. But the values recorded in 
the microscope are more &ldquo;representative&rdquo; of the conditions 
usually employed on a day-to-day basis in an e-beam tool 
than those obtained in the environment of a specialist 
instrument. All types of results are, therefore, reported so 
that users of the database can make their own judgment as

<p>to the suitability, or otherwise, of any given piece of 
information.
</p>
<p>The database currently contains several thousand individual 
values collected from more than 100 published papers and 
reports spanning the period from 1898 to the present day. Since 
this is a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo; the compilation is constantly being 
extended as additional values become available. As far as possi-
ble a consistent style of presentation is used so that data for dif-
ferent elements and compounds may readily be compared. All 
of the available data sets are grouped by element or compound 
name for each of the major information groups (SE yields, BSE 
yields, stopping powers, X-ray ionization cross sections). The 
data is presented in a simple two- column format with the origin 
of each of the data sets (numbered #1 to #n) indicated by a num-
ber in parenthesis referring back to the bibliography.
</p>
<p> Backscattered Electrons
</p>
<p>The data on the backscattered electron (BSE) yield as a func-
tion of the atomic number of the target and of the incident 
beam energy is of particular importance in Monte Carlo 
computations because it provides the best test of the scatter-
ing models that are used in the simulation. This data is there-
fore both the starting point for the construction of a Monte 
Carlo model, and the source of values against which the sim-
ulation can be tested. The backscattered electron section con-
tains data for 40 or more elements spread across the periodic 
table, as well as for a selection of compounds. If Castaing&rsquo;s 
rule can be assumed to be correct, then the backscattering 
yield of a compound can be found if the backscattering coef-
ficients and the atomic fraction of the elements that form it 
are known. Hence a desirable long-term goal is to obtain a 
complete set of BSE yield curves for elements. At present the 
BSE section contains information on more than 45 elements, 
which is barely half of the solid elements in the periodic 
table, and of this number perhaps only 25 % of the data sets 
are of the highest quality, so much experimental work 
remains to be done especially at the lower energies.
</p>
<p> Secondary Yields
</p>
<p>With the increasing interest in the simulation of secondary 
electron (SE) line profiles and images, there is a need to have 
detailed information on secondary electron yields as a func-
tion of atomic number and incident beam energy. Secondary 
electron emission was the subject of intense experimental 
study for a period of 20 years or more from the early 1930s, 
resulting in the publication of no less than six full-length 
books on the topic. This effort did not, however, produce as 
much experimental data as would have been expected, 
because the aim of much of the work that was done was to 
demonstrate that the SE yield versus energy curve followed a 
&ldquo;universal law&rdquo; (Seiler 1984), and to find the parameters 
describing this curve. As a result the data actually published 
was usually given in a normalized format that makes it diffi-
cult to derive absolute values. The database currently contains 
</p>
<p>yields for about 40 or elements, and a collection of inorganic 
compounds and polymers.
</p>
<p>The clear discrepancies that often exist between the compa-
rable sets of original yield figures for the same material may be 
the result of surface contamination, or the result of a different 
assumption about the appropriate emitted energy range for sec-
ondary electrons (usually now taken to be 0&ndash;50&nbsp;eV, although in 
some early work 0&ndash;70 or even 0&ndash;100&nbsp;eV was used). In addition, 
since many of the materials documented are poorly conducting 
the effects of charging must also be considered. For example, in 
studies of the oxides (e.g., Whetten and Laponsky 1957) maxi-
mum SE yields of δ &gt; 10 were measured using pulsed electron-
beam techniques. Clearly no non-conducting material can 
sustain this level of emission for any significant period of time, 
since it will become positively charged and recollect its own sec-
ondaries. Similarly at higher energies, where the SE yield δ &lt; 1 
and negative charging occurs, the incident beam energy must be 
corrected for any negative surface potential acquired by the sam-
ple to give a correct result (although there is no little evidence in 
the original papers that this has been done). Consequently, all SE 
yield results for insulators must be treated with caution unless 
the provenance of the original data is well documented.
</p>
<p>Since there is no sum rule for secondary yields, data must 
be acquired for every compound of interest over the energy 
range required, a task which will be a lengthy one unless suit-
ably automated procedures can be developed and applied. In 
addition it will be necessary to repeat many of the measure-
ments reported here using better techniques before any level 
of precision and accuracy can be obtained. In summary the 
SE data is in an even less satisfactory state than that for the BS 
electrons, even though a wider range of materials is covered, 
because the quality of much of the data is poor.
</p>
<p> Stopping Powers
</p>
<p>The stopping power of an electron in a solid, that is, the rate 
at which the electron transfers its energy to the material 
through which it is passing, is a quantity of the highest 
importance for all studies of electron-solid interactions since 
it determines, among other parameters the electron range 
(Bethe 1930), the rate of secondary electron production 
(Bethe 1941), the lateral distribution and the distribution in 
depth of X-ray production, and the generation and distribu-
tion of electron&ndash;hole pairs. Despite its importance there is no 
body of experimental measurements of stopping power at 
those energies of interest to electron microscopy and micro-
analysis. Instead stopping powers, and the quantities which 
depend on them, have been deduced by analyzing measure-
ments of the transmission energy spectrum of MeV-energy 
β-particles to yield a value for the mean ionization potential I 
of the specimen (ICRU 1983), and then Bethe&rsquo;s (1930) ana-
lytical expression for the stopping power has been invoked to 
compute the stopping power at the energy of interest. While 
this procedure is of acceptable accuracy at high energies 
(&gt;10&nbsp;keV) it is not reliable at lower energies because some of 
the interactions included in the value of I (e.g., inner shell 
ionizations) no longer contribute.

</p>
<p>The database contains experimentally determined stop-
ping power curves for a collection of elements and com-
pounds. The method for obtaining this information from 
electron energy loss spectra has been described elsewhere 
(Luo et&nbsp;al. 1991). The data is plotted in units of eV/&Aring; as a func-
tion of the incident energy in keV.&nbsp;At the high energy end of 
the profiles the data corresponds closely to values deduced 
from Bethe&rsquo;s (1930) law and using the I-values from the ICRU 
tables. At lower energies, however, significant deviations 
occur as the Bethe model becomes physically unrealistic 
although good agreement has been found with values com-
puted from a dielectric model of the solids (Ashley et&nbsp;al. 1979).
</p>
<p>The stopping power of a compound is the weighted sum 
of the stopping power of its constituents; thus a key priority 
for future work should be to complete the set of stopping 
power profiles for elements rather than to acquire more data 
on compounds.
</p>
<p> X-ray Ionization Cross Sections
</p>
<p>Measured values of the X-ray ionization cross sections for vari-
ous elements and emission lines as a function of incident beam 
energy are also of great importance in microanalysis. 
Unfortunately, as a brief study of the graphs included here will 
show, the amount of data available is small for K-shells, negligi-
ble for the L-shells, and all but non-existent for the M-shells and 
higher. This is the result of pervasive experimental difficulties, in 
particular, the fact that any measurement couples together the 
ionization cross section and the fluorescent yield ω. Since, as can 
be seen from the plots in section 5 of the database, the value of 
the fluorescent yield ω is poorly known for the L- and M-shells 
this causes a significant degree in uncertainty in the cross section 
deduced from this data. A more practically useful approach is, 
instead, to quote an &ldquo;X-ray generation&rdquo; cross section which is the 
product of the ionization cross section and the fluorescent yield 
term. Because the fluorescent term is never required separately 
in X-ray microanalysis this result looses nothing of its generality 
but is much more robust. Future updates of this database will 
include results in this format. For completeness section 5 tabu-
lates all the available fluorescent yield data for K-, L-, and 
M-shells.
</p>
<p> Conclusions
</p>
<p>This database is a first step toward the goal of providing a 
comprehensive collection of the parameters which describe 
electron&ndash;solid interactions. In addition to meeting the needs 
of those working in Monte Carlo modeling, it is hoped that a 
systematic collection of data such as this may also be of value 
in experimental electron microscopy. The quality and quan-
tity of the data that has been amassed varies widely from one 
material, and from one topic, to another, so that while a few 
elements can be considered as well characterized, the overall 
situation is poor, especially for materials used in such areas as 
integrated circuit device fabrication.
