<p>Preface
</p>
<p>It has been 30 years since the Second Edition. Plasma physics has grown so much
</p>
<p>that the temptation is to include all that&rsquo;s new, but I haven&rsquo;t done that. This is a book
</p>
<p>for those learning plasma physics for the first time and could care less about the fine
</p>
<p>points. The basics remain the same, but new areas have arisen: dusty plasmas and
</p>
<p>plasma accelerators, for instance, and these subjects had to be added. The semi-
</p>
<p>conductor industry has sprouted since the 1980s, affecting all our lives. Computer
</p>
<p>chips cannot be made without plasmas, but these are partially ionized,
</p>
<p>radiofrequency ones, which are new. I&rsquo;ve spent 25 years helping to make these
</p>
<p>industrial plasmas into an interesting subject, one that was previously avoided
</p>
<p>because it was too messy. Meanwhile, Al Gore has warned us about global
</p>
<p>warming. The best solution to this, and to energy shortage, is of course hydrogen
</p>
<p>fusion. With the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project
</p>
<p>going swimmingly in southern France, we are on schedule to get a fusion reactor by
</p>
<p>2050. In laser fusion, the NIF (National Ignition Facility) at Livermore can focus
</p>
<p>the entire energy output of the United States onto a pinpoint for a fraction of a
</p>
<p>nanosecond to get inertial fusion. It is a technical achievement without peer, but so
</p>
<p>far we don&rsquo;t have a laser that can pulse rapidly enough. Fusion plasma physics was
</p>
<p>planned to be Vol. 2 of this textbook; and, in answer to so many questions, it is still
</p>
<p>in future plans. The job will be easier now that I have written An Indispensable
</p>
<p>Truth, How Fusion Power Can Save the Planet, which includes a chapter on fusion
</p>
<p>physics.
</p>
<p>On the personal side, you will remember from the second edition that the &ldquo;poet&rdquo;
</p>
<p>(my father, who used to recite Chinese poetry from memory) had passed away, and
</p>
<p>that the &ldquo;eternal scholar&rdquo; (my mother) had finally gotten her Ph.D. at 72. She lived
</p>
<p>to 99 and died with a smile on her face. I myself am now 85, happily married for
</p>
<p>49 years to artist Ande (Edna backwards), and we have two daughters and a son:
</p>
<p>Sheryl, a Cistercian nun in Norway; Patricia, a dancer and English teacher in
</p>
<p>France; and Bob, a chemical oceanography professor and education expert at
</p>
<p>UMass Boston, as well as an active soccer coach. We have four granddaughters,
</p>
<p>v</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the three Boston ones being third-generation soccer players, and the French one a
</p>
<p>four-language linguist and former equestrian.
</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank all the instructors and students who have used the
</p>
<p>second edition and have pointed out errors and made suggestions for improvement.

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>1.1 Occurrence of Plasmas in Nature
</p>
<p>It is now believed that the universe is made of 69 % dark energy, 27 % dark
</p>
<p>matter, and 1 % normal matter. All that we can see in the sky is the part of normal
</p>
<p>matter that is in the plasma state, emitting radiation. Plasma in physics, not to be
</p>
<p>confused with blood plasma, is an &ldquo;ionized&rdquo; gas in which at least one of the
</p>
<p>electrons in an atom has been stripped free, leaving a positively charged nucleus,
</p>
<p>called an ion. Sometimes plasma is called the &ldquo;fourth state of matter.&rdquo; When a
</p>
<p>solid is heated, it becomes a liquid. Heating a liquid turns it into a gas. Upon
</p>
<p>further heating, the gas is ionized into a plasma. Since a plasma is made of ions
</p>
<p>and electrons, which are charged, electric fields are rampant everywhere, and
</p>
<p>particles &ldquo;collide&rdquo; not just when they bump into one another, but even at a
</p>
<p>distance where they can feel their electric fields. Hydrodynamics, which describes
</p>
<p>the flow of water through pipes, say, or the flow around boats in yacht races, or the
</p>
<p>behavior of airplane wings, is already a complicated subject. Adding the electric
</p>
<p>fields of a plasma greatly expands the range of possible motions, especially in the
</p>
<p>presence of magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>Plasma usually exists only in a vacuum. Otherwise, air will cool the plasma so
</p>
<p>that the ions and electrons will recombine into normal neutral atoms. In the
</p>
<p>laboratory, we need to pump the air out of a vacuum chamber. In the vacuum of
</p>
<p>space, however, much of the gas is in the plasma state, and we can see it. Stellar
</p>
<p>interiors and atmospheres, gaseous nebulas, and entire galaxies can be seen because
</p>
<p>they are in the plasma state. On earth, however, our atmosphere limits our experi-
</p>
<p>ence with plasmas to a few examples: the flash of a lightning bolt, the soft glow of
</p>
<p>the Aurora Borealis, the light of a fluorescent tube, or the pixels of a plasma TV. We
</p>
<p>live in a small part of the universe where plasmas do not occur naturally; otherwise,
</p>
<p>we would not be alive.

<p>The reason for this can be seen from the Saha equation, which tells us the amount
</p>
<p>of ionization to be expected in a gas in thermal equilibrium:
</p>
<p>ni
</p>
<p>nn
� 2:4� 1021
</p>
<p>T3=2
</p>
<p>ni
e�Ui=KT &eth;1:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here ni and nn are, respectively, the density (number per m
3) of ionized atoms and
</p>
<p>of neutral atoms, T is the gas temperature in �K, K is Boltzmann&rsquo;s constant, and Ui
is the ionization energy of the gas&mdash;that is, the number of joules required to remove
</p>
<p>the outermost electron from an atom. (The mks or International System of units will
</p>
<p>be used in this book.) For ordinary air at room temperature, we may take
</p>
<p>nn� 3� 10
25 m�3 (see Problem 1.1), T� 300� K, and Ui&frac14; 14.5 eV (for nitrogen),
</p>
<p>where 1 eV&frac14; 1.6� 10�19 J. The fractional ionization ni/(nn + ni)� ni/nn predicted
by Eq. (1.1) is ridiculously low:
</p>
<p>ni
</p>
<p>nn
� 10�122
</p>
<p>As the temperature is raised, the degree of ionization remains low untilUi is only a
</p>
<p>few times KT. Then ni/nn rises abruptly, and the gas is in a plasma state. Further
</p>
<p>increase in temperaturemakes nn less than ni, and the plasma eventually becomes fully
</p>
<p>ionized. This is the reason plasmas exist in astronomical bodies with temperatures of
</p>
<p>millions of degrees, but not on the earth. Life could not easily coexist with a plasma&mdash;
</p>
<p>at least, plasma of the type we are talking about. The natural occurrence of plasmas at
</p>
<p>high temperatures is the reason for the designation &ldquo;the fourth state of matter.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Although we do not intend to emphasize the Saha equation, we should point out
</p>
<p>its physical meaning. Atoms in a gas have a spread of thermal energies, and an atom
</p>
<p>is ionized when, by chance, it suffers a collision of high enough energy to knock out
</p>
<p>an electron. In a cold gas, such energetic collisions occur infrequently, since an atom
</p>
<p>must be accelerated to much higher than the average energy by a series of &ldquo;favor-
</p>
<p>able&rdquo; collisions. The exponential factor in Eq. (1.1) expresses the fact that the
</p>
<p>number of fast atoms falls exponentially with Ui /KT. Once an atom is ionized, it
</p>
<p>remains charged until it meets an electron; it then very likely recombines with the
</p>
<p>electron to become neutral again. The recombination rate clearly depends on the
</p>
<p>density of electrons, which we can take as equal to ni. The equilibrium ion fraction,
</p>
<p>therefore, should decrease with ni; and this is the reason for the factor ni
�1 on the
</p>
<p>right-hand side of Eq. (1.1). The plasma in the interstellar medium owes its existence
</p>
<p>to the low value of ni (about 1 per cm
3), and hence the low recombination rate.
</p>
<p>1.2 Definition of Plasma
</p>
<p>Any ionized gas cannot be called a plasma, of course; there is always some small
</p>
<p>degree of ionization in any gas. A useful definition is as follows:
</p>
<p>A plasma is a quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibits
</p>
<p>collective behavior.
</p>
<p>2 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We must now define &ldquo;quasineutral&rdquo; and &ldquo;collective behavior.&rdquo; The meaning of
</p>
<p>quasineutrality will be made clear in Sect. 1.4. What is meant by &ldquo;collective
</p>
<p>behavior&rdquo; is as follows.
</p>
<p>Consider the forces acting on a molecule of, say, ordinary air. Since the molecule
</p>
<p>is neutral, there is no net electromagnetic force on it, and the force of gravity is
</p>
<p>negligible. The molecule moves undisturbed until it makes a collision with another
</p>
<p>molecule, and these collisions control the particle&rsquo;s motion. A macroscopic force
</p>
<p>applied to a neutral gas, such as from a loudspeaker generating sound waves, is
</p>
<p>transmitted to the individual atoms by collisions. The situation is totally different in
</p>
<p>a plasma, which has charged particles. As these charges move around, they can
</p>
<p>generate local concentrations of positive or negative charge, which give rise to
</p>
<p>electric fields. Motion of charges also generates currents, and hence magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>These fields affect the motion of other charged particles far away.
</p>
<p>Let us consider the effect on each other of two slightly charged regions of
</p>
<p>plasma separated by a distance r (Fig. 1.1). The Coulomb force between A and
</p>
<p>B diminishes as 1/r2. However, for a given solid angle (that is, Δr/r&frac14; constant), the
volume of plasma in B that can affect A increases as r3. Therefore, elements of
</p>
<p>plasma exert a force on one another even at large distances. It is this long-ranged
</p>
<p>Coulomb force that gives the plasma a large repertoire of possible motions and
</p>
<p>enriches the field of study known as plasma physics. In fact, the most interesting
</p>
<p>results concern so-called &ldquo;collisionless&rdquo; plasmas, in which the long-range electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic forces are so much larger than the forces due to ordinary local collisions
</p>
<p>that the latter can be neglected altogether. By &ldquo;collective behavior&rdquo; we mean
</p>
<p>motions that depend not only on local conditions but on the state of the plasma
</p>
<p>in remote regions as well.
</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;plasma&rdquo; seems to be a misnomer. It comes from the Greek πλάσμα,
</p>
<p>�ατoς, τ�o, which means something molded or fabricated. Because of collective
behavior, a plasma does not tend to conform to external influences; rather, it often
</p>
<p>behaves as if it had a mind of its own.

<p>1.3 Concept of Temperature
</p>
<p>Before proceeding further, it is well to review and extend our physical notions of
</p>
<p>&ldquo;temperature.&rdquo; A gas in thermal equilibrium has particles of all velocities, and the
</p>
<p>most probable distribution of these velocities is known as the Maxwellian distribu-
</p>
<p>tion. For simplicity, consider a gas in which the particles can move only in one
</p>
<p>dimension. (This is not entirely frivolous; a strong magnetic field, for instance, can
</p>
<p>constrain electrons to move only along the field lines.) The one-dimensional
</p>
<p>Maxwellian distribution is given by
</p>
<p>f u&eth; &THORN; &frac14; A exp �1

mu2=KT
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>&eth;1:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>where f du is the number of particles per m3 with velocity between u and u + du,
1
2
mu2 is the kinetic energy, and K is Boltzmann&rsquo;s constant,
</p>
<p>K &frac14; 1:38� 10�23J=�K
</p>
<p>Note that a capital K is used here, since lower-case k is reserved for the propagation
</p>
<p>constant of waves. The density n, or number of particles per m3, is given by
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 1.2)

</p>
<p>f u&eth; &THORN;du &eth;1:3&THORN;

<p>The width of the distribution is characterized by the constant T, which we call
</p>
<p>the temperature. To see the exact meaning of T, we can compute the average kinetic
</p>
<p>energy of particles in this distribution:

</p>
<p>Since T and Eav are so closely related, it is customary in plasma physics to give
</p>
<p>temperatures in units of energy. To avoid confusion on the number of dimensions
</p>
<p>involved, it is not Eav but the energy corresponding to KT that is used to denote the
</p>
<p>temperature. For KT&frac14; 1 eV&frac14; 1.6� 10�19 J, we have

</p>
<p>By a 2-eV plasma we mean that KT&frac14; 2 eV, or Eav&frac14; 3 eV in three dimensions.
It is interesting that a plasma can have several temperatures at the same time.
</p>
<p>It often happens that the ions and the electrons have separate Maxwellian distribu-
</p>
<p>tions with different temperatures Ti and Te. This can come about because the
</p>
<p>collision rate among ions or among electrons themselves is larger than the rate of
</p>
<p>collisions between an ion and an electron. Then each species can be in its own
</p>
<p>thermal equilibrium, but the plasma may not last long enough for the two temper-
</p>
<p>atures to equalize. When there is a magnetic field B, even a single species, say ions,
can have two temperatures. This is because the forces acting on an ion along B are
different from those acting perpendicular to B (due to the Lorentz force). The
components of velocity perpendicular to B and parallel to B may then belong to
different Maxwellian distributions with temperatures T&perp; and T||.

<p>6 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Before leaving our review of the notion of temperature, we should dispel the
</p>
<p>popular misconception that high temperature necessarily means a lot of heat.
</p>
<p>People are usually amazed to learn that the electron temperature inside a fluorescent
</p>
<p>light bulb is about 20,000� K. &ldquo;My, it doesn&rsquo;t feel that hot!&rdquo; Of course, the heat
</p>
<p>capacity must also be taken into account. The density of electrons inside a fluores-
</p>
<p>cent tube is much less than that of a gas at atmospheric pressure, and the total
</p>
<p>amount of heat transferred to the wall by electrons striking it at their thermal
</p>
<p>velocities is not that great. Everyone has had the experience of a cigarette ash
</p>
<p>dropped innocuously on his hand. Although the temperature is high enough to cause
</p>
<p>a burn, the total amount of heat involved is not. Many laboratory plasmas have
</p>
<p>temperatures of the order of 1,000,000� K (100 eV), but at densities of only
</p>
<p>1018&ndash;1019 per m3, the heating of the walls is not a serious consideration.

<p>1.4 Debye Shielding
</p>
<p>A fundamental characteristic of the behavior of plasma is its ability to shield out
</p>
<p>electric potentials that are applied to it. Suppose we tried to put an electric field
</p>
<p>inside a plasma by inserting two charged balls connected to a battery (Fig. 1.3). The
</p>
<p>balls would attract particles of the opposite charge, and almost immediately a cloud
</p>
<p>of ions would surround the negative ball and a cloud of electrons would surround
</p>
<p>1.4 Debye Shielding 7</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the positive ball. (We assume that a layer of dielectric keeps the plasma from
</p>
<p>actually recombining on the surface, or that the battery is large enough to maintain
</p>
<p>the potential in spite of this.) If the plasma were cold and there were no thermal
</p>
<p>motions, there would be just as many charges in the cloud as in the ball, the
</p>
<p>shielding would be perfect, and no electric field would be present in the body of
</p>
<p>the plasma outside of the clouds. On the other hand, if the temperature is finite,
</p>
<p>those particles that are at the edge of the cloud, where the electric field is weak, have
</p>
<p>enough thermal energy to escape from the electrostatic potential well. The &ldquo;edge&rdquo;
</p>
<p>of the cloud then occurs at the radius where the potential energy is approximately
</p>
<p>equal to the thermal energy KT of the particles, and the shielding is not complete.
</p>
<p>Potentials of the order of KT/e can leak into the plasma and cause finite electric
</p>
<p>fields to exist there.
</p>
<p>Let us compute the approximate thickness of such a charge cloud. Imagine that
</p>
<p>the potential ϕ on the plane x&frac14; 0 is held at a value ϕ0 by a perfectly transparent grid
(Fig. 1.4). We wish to compute ϕ(x). For simplicity, we assume that the ion&ndash;
</p>
<p>electron mass ratioM/m is infinite, so that the ions do not move but form a uniform
</p>
<p>background of positive charge. To be more precise, we can say that M/m is large

</p>
<p>It would not be worthwhile to prove this here. What this equation says is intuitively
</p>
<p>obvious: There are fewer particles at places where the potential energy is large,
</p>
<p>since not all particles have enough energy to get there. Integrating f (u) over u,
</p>
<p>setting q&frac14;�e, and noting that ne(ϕ! 0)&frac14; n1, we find
</p>
<p>ne &frac14; n1exp eϕ=KTe&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>This equation will be derived with more physical insight in Sect. 3.5. Substituting

<p>No simplification is possible for the region near the grid, where jeϕ/KTej may be
large. Fortunately, this region does not contribute much to the thickness of the cloud

<p>We can write the solution of Eq. (1.14) as
</p>
<p>ϕ &frac14; ϕ0exp � xj j=λD&eth; &THORN; &eth;1:17&THORN;
</p>
<p>The quantity λD, called the Debye length, is a measure of the shielding distance or
</p>
<p>thickness of the sheath.
</p>
<p>Note that as the density is increased, λD decreases, as one would expect, since
</p>
<p>each layer of plasma contains more electrons. Furthermore, λD increases with
</p>
<p>increasing KTe. Without thermal agitation, the charge cloud would collapse to an
</p>
<p>infinitely thin layer. Finally, it is the electron temperature which is used in the
</p>
<p>definition of λD because the electrons, being more mobile than the ions, generally
</p>
<p>do the shielding by moving so as to create a surplus or deficit of negative charge.
</p>
<p>Only in special situations is this not true (see Problem 1.5).
</p>
<p>The following are useful forms of Eq. (1.16):
</p>
<p>λD &frac14; 69 Te=n&eth; &THORN;

</p>
<p>m, KTe in eV
&eth;1:18&THORN;
</p>
<p>We are now in a position to define &ldquo;quasineutrality.&rdquo; If the dimensions L of a system
</p>
<p>are much larger than λD, then whenever local concentrations of charge arise or
</p>
<p>external potentials are introduced into the system, these are shielded out in a
</p>
<p>distance short compared with L, leaving the bulk of the plasma free of large electric
</p>
<p>potentials or fields. Outside of the sheath on the wall or on an obstacle,&nabla;2ϕ is very
</p>
<p>small, and ni is equal to ne, typically to better than one part in 10
6. It takes only a
</p>
<p>small charge imbalance to give rise to potentials of the order of KT/e. The plasma is
</p>
<p>&ldquo;quasineutral&rdquo;; that is, neutral enough so that one can take ni&rsquo; ne&rsquo; n, where n is a
common density called the plasma density, but not so neutral that all the interesting
</p>
<p>electromagnetic forces vanish.
</p>
<p>A criterion for an ionized gas to be a plasma is that it be dense enough that λD is
</p>
<p>much smaller than L.
</p>
<p>The phenomenon of Debye shielding also occurs&mdash;in modified form&mdash;in single-
</p>
<p>species systems, such as the electron streams in klystrons and magnetrons or the
</p>
<p>proton beam in a cyclotron. In such cases, any local bunching of particles causes a
</p>
<p>large unshielded electric field unless the density is extremely low (which it often is).
</p>
<p>An externally imposed potential&mdash;from a wire probe, for instance&mdash;would be
</p>
<p>shielded out by an adjustment of the density near the electrode. Single-species
</p>
<p>systems, or unneutralized plasmas, are not strictly plasmas; but the mathematical
</p>
<p>tools of plasma physics can be used to study such systems.
</p>
<p>Debye shielding can be foiled if electrons are so fast that they do not collide with
</p>
<p>one another enough to maintain a thermal distribution. We shall see later that
</p>
<p>electron collisions are infrequent if the electrons are very hot. In that case, some
</p>
<p>electrons, attracted by the positive charge of the ion, come in at an angle so fast that
</p>
<p>they orbit the ion like a satellite around a planet. How this works will be clear in the
</p>
<p>discussion of Langmuir probes in a later chapter. Some like to call this effect anti-
</p>
<p>shielding.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.5 The Plasma Parameter
</p>
<p>The picture of Debye shielding that we have given above is valid only if there are
</p>
<p>enough particles in the charge cloud. Clearly, if there are only one or two particles
</p>
<p>in the sheath region, Debye shielding would not be a statistically valid concept.
</p>
<p>Using Eq. (1.17), we can compute the number ND of particles in a &ldquo;Debye sphere&rdquo;:

<p>In addition to λD� L, &ldquo;collective behavior&rdquo; requires
</p>
<p>ND⋙ 1 &eth;1:20&THORN;
</p>
<p>1.6 Criteria for Plasmas
</p>
<p>We have given two conditions that an ionized gas must satisfy to be called a plasma.
</p>
<p>A third condition has to do with collisions. The weakly ionized gas in an airplane&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>jet exhaust, for example, does not qualify as a plasma because the charged particles
</p>
<p>collide so frequently with neutral atoms that their motion is controlled by ordinary
</p>
<p>hydrodynamic forces rather than by electromagnetic forces. If ω is the frequency of
</p>
<p>typical plasma oscillations and τ is the mean time between collisions with neutral
</p>
<p>atoms, we require ωτ&gt; 1 for the gas to behave like a plasma rather than a
neutral gas.
</p>
<p>The three conditions a plasma must satisfy are therefore:
</p>

</p>
<p>1. Typical fusion reactor: n&frac14; 1020, KT&frac14; 30,000.

<p>KT&frac14; 1000 (pinch).
3. Typical ionosphere: n&frac14; 1011, KT&frac14; 0.05.
4. Typical radiofrequency plasma: n&frac14; 1017, KT&frac14; 1.5

<p>1.7. Compute λD and ND for the following cases:
</p>
<p>(a) A glow discharge, with n&frac14; 1016m�3, KTe&frac14; 2 eV.
(b) The earth&rsquo;s ionosphere, with n&frac14; 1012 m�3, KTe&frac14; 0.1 eV.
(c) A θ-pinch, with n&frac14; 1023 m�3, KTe&frac14; 800 eV.
</p>
<p>1.7 Applications of Plasma Physics
</p>
<p>Plasmas can be characterized by the two parameters n and KTe. Plasma applica-
</p>
<p>tions cover an extremely wide range of n and KTe: n varies over 28 orders of
</p>
<p>magnitude from 106 to 1034 m�3, and KT can vary over seven orders from 0.1 to
</p>
<p>106 eV. Some of these applications are discussed very briefly below. The tremen-
</p>
<p>dous range of density can be appreciated when one realizes that air and water
</p>
<p>12 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>differ in density by only 103, while water and white dwarf stars are separated by
</p>
<p>only a factor of 105. Even neutron stars are only 1015 times denser than water. Yet
</p>
<p>gaseous plasmas in the entire density range of 1028 can be described by the same
</p>
<p>set of equations, since only the classical (non-quantum mechanical) laws of
</p>
<p>physics are needed.
</p>
<p>1.7.1 Gas Discharges (Gaseous Electronics)
</p>
<p>The earliest work with plasmas was that of Langmuir, Tonks, and their collabo-
</p>
<p>rators in the 1920s. This research was inspired by the need to develop vacuum
</p>
<p>tubes that could carry large currents, and therefore had to be filled with ionized
</p>
<p>gases. The research was done with weakly ionized glow discharges and positive
</p>
<p>columns typically with KTe&rsquo; 2 eV and 10
14&lt; n&lt; 1018 m�3. It was here that the
</p>
<p>shielding phenomenon was discovered; the sheath surrounding an electrode could
</p>
<p>be seen visually as a dark layer. Before semiconductors, gas discharges were
</p>
<p>encountered only in mercury rectifiers, hydrogen thyratrons, ignitrons, spark
</p>
<p>gaps, welding arcs, neon and fluorescent lights, and lightning discharges.
</p>
<p>The semiconductor industry&rsquo;s rapid growth in the last two decades has brought
</p>
<p>gas discharges from a small academic discipline to an economic giant. Chips
</p>
<p>for computers and the ubiquitous handheld devices cannot be made without
</p>
<p>plasmas. Usually driven by radiofrequency power, partially ionized plasmas
</p>
<p>(gas discharges) are used for etching and deposition in the manufacture of
</p>
<p>semiconductors.
</p>
<p>1.7.2 Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion
</p>
<p>Modern plasma physics had its beginnings around 1952, when it was proposed that
</p>
<p>the hydrogen bomb fusion reaction be controlled to make a reactor. A seminal
</p>
<p>conference was held in Geneva in 1958 at which each nation revealed its classified
</p>
<p>controlled fusion program for the first time. Fusion power requires holding a
</p>
<p>30-keV plasma with a magnetic field for as long as one second. Research was
</p>
<p>carried out by each individual country until 2007, when the ITER project was
</p>
<p>started. ITER stands for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, a large
</p>
<p>experiment being built in France and funded by seven countries. Serendipitously,
</p>
<p>ITER is a Latin word meaning path or road. It is a road that mankind must take to
</p>
<p>solve the problems of global warming and oil shortage by 2050. Of all the
</p>
<p>&ldquo;magnetic bottles&rdquo; presented at Geneva, the USSR&rsquo;s TOKAMAK has survived as the
</p>

<p>The fuel is heavy hydrogen (deuterium), which exists naturally as one part in
</p>
<p>�6000 of water. The principal reactions, which involve deuterium (D) and tritium
(T) atoms, are as follows:
</p>
<p>D&thorn; D !3He&thorn; n&thorn; 3:2MeV
</p>
<p>D&thorn; D ! T&thorn; p&thorn; 4:0MeV
</p>
<p>D&thorn; T !4He&thorn; n&thorn; 17:6MeV
</p>
<p>These cross sections are appreciable only for incident energies above 5 keV.
</p>
<p>Accelerated beams of deuterons bombarding a target will not work, because most
</p>
<p>of the deuterons will lose their energy by scattering before undergoing a fusion
</p>
<p>reaction. It is necessary to create a plasma with temperatures above 10 keV so that
</p>
<p>there are enough ions in the 40-keV range where the reaction cross section
</p>
<p>maximizes. The problem of heating and containing such a plasma is responsible
</p>
<p>for the rapid growth of the science of plasma physics since 1952.
</p>
<p>1.7.3 Space Physics
</p>
<p>Another important application of plasma physics is in the study of the earth&rsquo;s envi-
</p>
<p>ronment in space. A continuous stream of charged particles, called the solar wind,
</p>
<p>impinges on the earth&rsquo;s magnetosphere, which shields us from this radiation and is
</p>
<p>distorted by it in the process. Typical parameters in the solarwind are n&frac14; 9� 106m�3,
KTi&frac14; 10 eV, KTe&frac14; 12 eV, B&frac14; 7� 10
</p>
<p>�9 T, and drift velocity 450 km/s. The
</p>
<p>ionosphere, extending from an altitude of 50 km to 10 earth radii, is populated by a
</p>
<p>weakly ionized plasma with density varying with altitude up to n&frac14; 1012 m�3. The
temperature is only 10�1 eV. The solar wind blows the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field into a
</p>
<p>long tail on the night side of the earth. The magnetic field lines there can reconnect
</p>
<p>and accelerate ions in the process. This will be discussed in a later chapter.
</p>
<p>The Van Allen radiation belts are two rings of charged particles above the
</p>
<p>equator trapped by the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. Here we have n� 109 m�3,
KTe� 1 keV, KTi&rsquo; 1 eV, and B&rsquo; 500� 10
</p>
<p>�9 T. In addition, there is a hot com-
</p>
<p>ponent with n&frac14; 103 m�3 and KTe&frac14; 40 keV, and some ions have 100s of MeV.
Exploration of other planets have revealed the presence of plasmas. Though
</p>
<p>Mercury, Venus, and Mars have little plasma phenomena, the giant plants Jupiter
</p>
<p>and Saturn and their moons can have plasma created by lightning strikes. In 2013
</p>
<p>The Voyager 1 satellite reached the boundary of the solar system. This was
</p>
<p>ascertained by detecting an increase in the plasma frequency there (!).
</p>
<p>1.7.4 Modern Astrophysics
</p>
<p>Stellar interiors and atmospheres are hot enough to be in the plasma state. The
</p>
<p>temperature at the core of the sun, for instance, is estimated to be 2 keV;
</p>
<p>14 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>thermonuclear reactions occurring at this temperature are responsible for the sun&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>radiation. The solar corona is a tenuous plasma with temperatures up to 200 eV. The
</p>
<p>interstellar medium contains ionized hydrogen with n&rsquo; 106m�3 (1 per cc). Various
plasma theories have been used to explain the acceleration of cosmic rays.
</p>
<p>Although the stars in a galaxy are not charged, they behave like particles in a
</p>
<p>plasma; and plasma kinetic theory has been used to predict the development of
</p>
<p>galaxies. Radio astronomy has uncovered numerous sources of radiation that most
</p>
<p>likely originate from plasmas. The Crab nebula is a rich source of plasma phenom-
</p>
<p>ena because it is known to contain a magnetic field. It also contains a visual pulsar.
</p>
<p>Current theories of pulsars picture them as rapidly rotating neutron stars with
</p>
<p>plasmas emitting synchrotron radiation from the surface. Active galactic nuclei
</p>
<p>and black holes have come to the forefront. Astrophysics now requires an under-
</p>
<p>standing of plasma physics.
</p>
<p>1.7.5 MHD Energy Conversion and Ion Propulsion
</p>
<p>Getting back down to earth, we come to two practical applications of plasma
</p>
<p>physics. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) energy conversion utilizes a dense plasma
</p>
<p>jet propelled across a magnetic field to generate electricity (Fig. 1.5). The Lorentz
</p>
<p>force qv�B, where v is the jet velocity, causes the ions to drift upward and
the electrons downward, charging the two electrodes to different potentials. Elec-
</p>
<p>trical current can then be drawn from the electrodes without the inefficiency of a
</p>
<p>heat cycle.
</p>
<p>A more important application uses this principle in reverse to develop engines
</p>
<p>for interplanetary missions. In Fig. 1.6, a current is driven through a plasma by
</p>
<p>applying a voltage to the two electrodes. The j�B force shoots the plasma out of
the rocket, and the ensuing reaction force accelerates the rocket. A more modern
</p>
<p>device called a Hall thruster uses a magnetic field to stop the electrons while a high
</p>
<p>voltage accelerates the ions out the back, giving their momenta to the spacecraft.
</p>
<p>A separate discharge ejects an equal number of warm electrons; otherwise, the
</p>
<p>space ship will charge to a high potential.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.7.6 Solid State Plasmas
</p>
<p>The free electrons and holes in semiconductors constitute a plasma exhibiting the
</p>
<p>same sort of oscillations and instabilities as a gaseous plasma. Plasmas injected into
</p>
<p>InSb have been particularly useful in studies of these phenomena. Because of the
</p>
<p>lattice effects, the effective collision frequency is much less than one would expect
</p>
<p>in a solid with n&rsquo; 1029 m�3. Furthermore, the holes in a semiconductor can have a
very low effective mass&mdash;as little as 0.01 me&mdash;and therefore have high cyclotron
</p>
<p>frequencies even in moderate magnetic fields. If one were to calculate ND for a solid
</p>
<p>state plasma, it would be less than unity because of the low temperature and high
</p>
<p>density. Quantum mechanical effects (uncertainty principle), however, give the
</p>
<p>plasma an effective temperature high enough to make ND respectably large. Certain
</p>
<p>liquids, such as solutions of sodium in ammonia, have been found to behave like
</p>
<p>plasmas also.
</p>
<p>1.7.7 Gas Lasers
</p>
<p>The most common method to &ldquo;pump&rdquo; a gas laser&mdash;that is, to invert the population
</p>
<p>in the states that give rise to light amplification&mdash;is to use a gas discharge. This can
</p>
<p>be a low-pressure glow discharge for a dc laser or a high-pressure avalanche
</p>
<p>discharge in a pulsed laser. The He&ndash;Ne lasers commonly used for alignment and
</p>
<p>surveying and the Ar and Kr lasers used in light shows are examples of dc gas
</p>
<p>lasers. The powerful CO2 laser has a commercial application as a cutting tool.
</p>
<p>Molecular lasers such as the hydrogen cyanide (HCN) laser make possible studies
</p>
<p>of the hitherto inaccessible far infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The
</p>
<p>krypton fluoride (KrF) laser uses a large electron beam to excite the gas. It has the
</p>
<p>repetition rate but not the power for a laser-driven fusion reactor. In the semicon-
</p>
<p>ductor industry, short-wavelength ultraviolet lasers are used to etch ever smaller
</p>
<p>transistors on a chip. Excimer lasers such as the argon fluoride laser with 193 nm
</p>
<p>wavelength are used, with plans to go down to 5 nm.

<p>1.7.8 Particle Accelerators
</p>
<p>In high-energy particle research, linear accelerators are used to avoid synchrotron
</p>
<p>radiation on curves, especially for electrons. The 3-km long SLAC accelerator at
</p>
<p>Stanford produces 50-GeV electrons and positrons. Plasma accelerators generate
</p>
<p>plasma waves on which particles &ldquo;surf&rdquo; to gain energy. This technique has been
</p>
<p>applied at SLAC to double the energy from 42 to 84 GeV. A 31-km International
</p>
<p>Linear Collider is being built to generate 500 GeV colliding beams of electrons and
</p>
<p>positrons. In principle, plasma waves can add 1 GeV per cm.
</p>
<p>1.7.9 Industrial Plasmas
</p>
<p>Aside from their use in semiconductor production, partially ionized plasmas of high
</p>
<p>density have other industrial applications. Magnetrons are used in sputtering, a
</p>
<p>method of applying coatings of different materials. Eyeglasses can be coated with
</p>
<p>plasmas. Arcs, such as those in search lights, are plasmas. Instruments in medical
</p>
<p>research can be cleaned thoroughly with plasmas.
</p>
<p>1.7.10 Atmospheric Plasmas
</p>
<p>Most plasmas are created in vacuum systems, but it is also possible to produce
</p>
<p>plasmas at atmospheric pressure. For instance, a jet of argon and helium can be
</p>
<p>ionized with radiofrequency power. This makes possible small pencil-size devices
</p>
<p>for cauterizing skin. Industrial substrates can be processed by sweeping such a jet to
</p>
<p>cover a large area. Large atmospheric-pressure plasmas can also be produced for
</p>
<p>roll-to-roll processing.
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>1.8. In laser fusion, the core of a small pellet of DT is compressed to a density of
</p>
<p>1033m�3 at a temperature of 50,000,000 �K. Estimate the number of particles
</p>
<p>in a Debye sphere in this plasma.
</p>
<p>1.9. A distant galaxy contains a cloud of protons and antiprotons, each with
</p>
<p>density n&frac14; 106 m�3 and temperature 100� K. What is the Debye length?
1.10. (Advanced problem) A spherical conductor of radius a is immersed in a
</p>
<p>uniform plasma and charged to a potential ϕ0. The electrons remain Max-
</p>
<p>wellian and move to form a Debye shield, but the ions are stationary during
</p>
<p>the time frame of the experiment.
</p>
<p>(a) Assuming eϕ/KTe� 1, write Poisson&rsquo;s equation for this problem in
terms of λD.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.11. A field-effect transistor (FET) is basically an electron valve that operates on a
</p>
<p>finite-Debye-length effect. Conduction electrons flow from the source S to
</p>
<p>the drain D through a semiconducting material when a potential is applied
</p>
<p>between them. When a negative potential is applied to the insulated gate G,
</p>
<p>no current can flow through G, but the applied potential leaks into the
</p>
<p>semiconductor and repels electrons. The channel width is narrowed and the
</p>
<p>electron flow impeded in proportion to the gate potential. If the thickness of
</p>
<p>the device is too large, Debye shielding prevents the gate voltage from
</p>
<p>penetrating far enough. Estimate the maximum thickness of the conduction
</p>
<p>layer of an n-channel FET if it has doping level (plasma density) of 1022m�3,
</p>
<p>is at room temperature, and is to be no more than 10 Debye lengths thick.

<p>For instance, this potential is Eioniz&frac14; 15.8 eV in argon. Consider a
one-dimensional plasma with electron velocities u in the x direction only.

</p>
<p>Single-Particle Motions
</p>
<p>2.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>What makes plasmas particularly difficult to analyze is the fact that the densities
</p>
<p>fall in an intermediate range. Fluids like water are so dense that the motions of
</p>
<p>individual molecules do not have to be considered. Collisions dominate, and the
</p>
<p>simple equations of ordinary fluid dynamics suffice. At the other extreme in very
</p>
<p>low-density devices like the alternating-gradient synchrotron, only single-particle
</p>
<p>trajectories need be considered; collective effects are often unimportant. Plasmas
</p>
<p>behave sometimes like fluids, and sometimes like a collection of individual parti-
</p>
<p>cles. The first step in learning how to deal with this schizophrenic personality is to
</p>
<p>understand how single particles behave in electric and magnetic fields. This chapter
</p>
<p>differs from succeeding ones in that the E and B fields are assumed to be prescribed
and not affected by the charged particles.

<p>20 2 Single-Particle Motions</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>generated by the charged particle is opposite to the externally imposed field. Plasma
</p>
<p>particles, therefore, tend to reduce the magnetic field, and plasmas are diamagnetic.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 2.1, the right-hand rule with the thumb pointed in the B direction would give
ions a clockwise gyration. Ions gyrate counterclockwise to generate an opposing B,
thus lowering the energy of the system. In addition to this motion, there is an
</p>
<p>arbitrary velocity vz along B which is not affected by B. The trajectory of a charged
particle in space is, in general, a helix.
</p>
<p>2.2.2 Finite E
</p>
<p>If now we allow an electric field to be present, the motion will be found to be the
</p>
<p>sum of two motions: the usual circular Larmor gyration plus a drift of the guiding
</p>
<p>center. We may choose E to lie in the x&ndash;z plane so that Ey&frac14; 0. As before, the

<p>To obtain a general formula for vgc, we can solve Eq. (2.8) in vector form.
We may omit the m dv/dt term in Eq. (2.8), since this term gives only the circular
motion at ωc, which we already know about. Then Eq. (2.8) becomes

</p>
<p>It is important to note that vE is independent of q, m, and v&perp;. The reason is
obvious from the following physical picture. In the first half-cycle of the ion&rsquo;s orbit
</p>
<p>in Fig. 2.2, it gains energy from the electric field and increases in v&perp; and, hence,
</p>
<p>in rL. In the second half-cycle, it loses energy and decreases in rL. This difference
</p>
<p>in rL on the left and right sides of the orbit causes the drift vE. A negative electron
</p>
<p>gyrates in the opposite direction but also gains energy in the opposite direction; it
</p>
<p>ends up drifting in the same direction as an ion. For particles of the same velocity
</p>
<p>but different mass, the lighter one will have smaller rL and hence drift less per
</p>
<p>cycle. However, its gyration frequency is also larger, and the two effects exactly
</p>
<p>cancel. Two particles of the same mass but different energy would have the same
</p>
<p>ωc. The slower one will have smaller rL and hence gain less energy from E in a half-
cycle. However, for less energetic particles the fractional change in rL for a given
</p>
<p>change in energy is larger, and these two effects cancel (Problem 2.4).
</p>
<p>The three-dimensional orbit in space is therefore a slanted helix with changing
</p>
<p>pitch (Fig. 2.3).

<p>This is similar to the drift vE in that it is perpendicular to both the force and B, but it
differs in one important respect. The drift vg changes sign with the particle&rsquo;s charge.
Under a gravitational force, ions and electrons drift in opposite directions, so there

</p>
<p>The physical reason for this drift (Fig. 2.4) is again the change in Larmor radius as
</p>
<p>the particle gains and loses energy in the gravitational field. Now the electrons
</p>
<p>gyrate in the opposite sense to the ions, but the force on them is in the same
</p>
<p>direction, so the drift is in the opposite direction. The magnitude of vg is usually
negligible (Problem 2.6), but when the lines of force are curved, there is an effective
</p>
<p>gravitational force due to centrifugal force. This force, which is not negligible, is
</p>
<p>independent of mass; this is why we did not stress the m dependence of Eq. (2.18).
</p>
<p>Centrifugal force is the basis of a plasma instability called the &ldquo;gravitational&rdquo;
</p>
<p>instability, which has nothing to do with real gravity.

<p>Problems
</p>
<p>2.1. Compute rL for the following cases if vk is negligible:
</p>
<p>(a) A 10-keV electron in the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field of 5� 10�5 T.
(b) A solar wind proton with streaming velocity 300 km/s, B&frac14; 5� 10�9 T.
(c) A 1-keV He+ ion in the solar atmosphere near a sunspot, where
</p>
<p>B&frac14; 5� 10�2 T.
(d) A 3.5-MeV He++ ash particle in an 8-T DT fusion reactor.
</p>
<p>2.2. In the TFTR (Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor) at Princeton, the plasma was
</p>
<p>heated by injection of 200-keV neutral deuterium atoms, which, after entering
</p>
<p>the magnetic field, are converted to 200-keV D ions (A&frac14; 2) by charge
exchange. These ions are confined only if rL� a, where a&frac14; 0.6 m is the
minor radius of the toroidal plasma. Compute the maximum Larmor radius
</p>
<p>in a 5-T field to see if this is satisfied.
</p>
<p>2.3. An ion engine (see Fig. 1.6) has a 1-T magnetic field, and a hydrogen plasma is
</p>
<p>to be shot out at an E�B velocity of 1000 km/s. How much internal electric
field must be present in the plasma?
</p>
<p>2.4. Show that vE is the same for two ions of equal mass and charge but different
</p>
<p>energies, by using the following physical picture (see Fig. 2.2). Approximate
</p>
<p>the right half of the orbit by a semicircle corresponding to the ion energy after
</p>
<p>acceleration by the E field, and the left half by a semicircle corresponding to
the energy after deceleration. You may assume that E is weak, so that the
fractional change in v&perp; is small.
</p>
<p>2.5. Suppose electrons obey the Boltzmann relation of Problem 1.5 in a cylindri-
</p>
<p>cally symmetric plasma column in which n(r) varies with a scale length λ; that
</p>
<p>is, &part;n/&part;r&rsquo;�n/λ.
</p>
<p>(a) Using E &frac14; �&nabla;ϕ, find the radial electric field for given λ.
(b) For electrons, show that finite Larmor radius effects are large if vE is as
</p>
<p>large as vth. Specifically, show that rL&frac14; 2λ if vE&frac14; vth.
(c) Is (b) also true for ions?
</p>
<p>Hint: Do not use Poisson&rsquo;s equation.
</p>
<p>2.6. Suppose that a so-called Q-machine has a uniform field of 0.2 T and a
</p>
<p>cylindrical plasma with KTe&frac14;KTi&frac14; 0.2 eV. The density profile is found
experimentally to be of the form

</p>
<p>� 	
</p>
<p>Assume the density obeys the electron Boltzmann relation n&frac14; n0
exp (eϕ/KTe).
</p>
<p>(a) Calculate the maximum vE if a&frac14; 1 cm.
(b) Compare this with vg due to the earth&rsquo;s gravitational field.
</p>
<p>(c) To what value can B be lowered before the ions of potassium (A&frac14; 39,
Z&frac14; 1) have a Larmor radius equal to a?

<p>2.3 Nonuniform B Field
</p>
<p>Now that the concept of a guiding center drift is firmly established, we can discuss
</p>
<p>the motion of particles in inhomogeneous fields&mdash;E and B fields which vary in
space or time. For uniform fields we were able to obtain exact expressions for the
</p>
<p>guiding center drifts. As soon as we introduce inhomogeneity, the problem becomes
</p>
<p>too complicated to solve exactly. To get an approximate answer, it is customary to
</p>
<p>expand in the small ratio rL/L, where L is the scale length of the inhomogeneity.
</p>
<p>This type of theory, called orbit theory, can become extremely involved. We shall
</p>
<p>examine only the simplest cases, where only one inhomogeneity occurs at a time.
</p>
<p>2.3.1 &nabla;B&perp;B: Grad-B Drift
</p>
<p>Here the lines of force1 are straight, but their density increases, say, in the
</p>
<p>y direction (Fig. 2.5). We can anticipate the result by using our simple physical
</p>
<p>picture. The gradient in jBj causes the Larmor radius to be larger at the bottom of
the orbit than at the top, and this should lead to a drift, in opposite directions for ions
</p>
<p>and electrons, perpendicular to both B and&nabla;B. The drift velocity should obviously
be proportional to rL/L and to v&perp;.
</p>
<p>Consider the Lorentz force F&frac14; qv�B, averaged over a gyration. Clearly,
</p>
<p>Fx &frac14; 0; since the particle spends as much time moving up as down. We wish
</p>
<p>to calculate Fy; in an approximate fashion, by using the undisturbed orbit of the
particle to find the average. The undisturbed orbit is given by Eqs. (2.4a),
</p>
<p>1The magnetic field lines are often called &ldquo;lines of force.&rdquo; They are not lines of force. The
</p>
<p>misnomer is perpetuated here to prepare the student for the treacheries of his profession.

<p>(2.4b), and (2.7) for a uniform B field. Taking the real part of Eqs. (2.4a) and
(2.4b), we have

of the charge, and lightface B stands for jBj. The quantity v&nabla;B is called the grad-B
drift; it is in opposite directions for ions and electrons and causes a current
</p>
<p>transverse to B. An exact calculation of v&nabla;B would require using the exact orbit,
including the drift, in the averaging process.

<p>2.3.2 Curved B: Curvature Drift
</p>
<p>Here we assume the lines of force to be curved with a constant radius of curvature
</p>
<p>Rc, and we take jBj to be constant (Fig. 2.6). Such a field does not obey Maxwell&rsquo;s
equations in a vacuum, so in practice the grad-B drift will always be added to the
</p>
<p>effect derived here. A guiding center drift arises from the centrifugal force felt by
</p>
<p>the particles as they move along the field lines in their thermal motion. If v2k denotes
</p>
<p>the average square of the component of random velocity along B, the average
centrifugal force is

We must now compute the grad-B drift which accompanies this when the
</p>
<p>decrease of jBj with radius is taken into account. In a vacuum, we have &nabla;�B&frac14; 0.
In the cylindrical coordinates of Fig. 2.6, &nabla;�B has only a z component, since B has
only a θ component and &nabla;B only an r component. We then have

<p>It is unfortunate that these drifts add. This means that if one bends a magnetic

<p>field into a torus for the purpose of confining a thermonuclear plasma, the particles
</p>
<p>will drift out of the torus no matter how one juggles the temperatures and magnetic
</p>
<p>fields.
</p>
<p>For a Maxwellian distribution, Eqs. (1.7) and (1.10) indicate that v2k and

v2

are
</p>
<p>each equal to KT/m, since v&perp; involves two degrees of freedom. Equations (2.3) and

<p>2.3.3 &nabla;BjjB: Magnetic Mirrors
</p>
<p>Now we consider a magnetic field which is pointed primarily in the z direction and
</p>
<p>whose magnitude varies in the z direction. Let the field be axisymmetric, with
</p>
<p>Bθ&frac14; 0 and &part;/&part;θ&frac14; 0. Since the lines of force converge and diverge, there is
necessarily a component Br (Fig. 2.7). We wish to show that this gives rise to a

<p>The variation of jBj with r causes a grad-B drift of guiding centers about the axis of

of the Lorentz force are

gyration. Term 3 vanishes on the axis; when it does not vanish, this azimuthal
</p>
<p>force causes a drift in the radial direction. This drift merely makes the guiding
</p>
<p>centers follow the lines of force. Term 4 is the one we are interested in. Using

<p>The invariance of μ is the basis for one of the primary schemes for plasma
</p>
<p>confinement: the magnetic mirror. As a particle moves from a weak-field region to
</p>
<p>a strong-field region in the course of its thermal motion, it sees an increasing B, and
</p>
<p>therefore its v&perp;must increase in order to keep μ constant. Since its total energy must
</p>
<p>remain constant, vk must necessarily decrease. If B is high enough in the &ldquo;throat&rdquo; of
</p>
<p>the mirror, vk eventually becomes zero; and the particle is &ldquo;reflected&rdquo; back to the
</p>
<p>weak-field region. It is, of course, the force Fk which causes the reflection. The
nonuniform field of a simple pair of coils forms two magnetic mirrors between
</p>
<p>which a plasma can be trapped (Fig. 2.8). This effect works on both ions and
</p>
<p>electrons.
</p>
<p>The trapping is not perfect, however. For instance, a particle with v&perp;&frac14; 0 will
have no magnetic moment and will not feel any force along B. A particle with small
v&perp;=vk at the midplane (B&frac14;B0) will also escape if the maximum field Bm is not large
</p>
<p>enough. For given B0 and Bm, which particles will escape? A particle with v&perp;&frac14; v&perp;0
and vk&frac14; vk0 at the midplane will have v&perp; &frac14; v

<p>0

</p>
<p>velocity space in the shape of a cone, called a loss cone (Fig. 2.9). Particles lying
</p>
<p>within the loss cone are not confined. Consequently, a mirror-confined plasma is
</p>
<p>never isotropic. Note that the loss cone is independent of q orm. Without collisions,
</p>
<p>both ions and electrons are equally well confined. When collisions occur, particles
</p>
<p>are lost when they change their pitch angle in a collision and are scattered into the
</p>
<p>loss cone. Generally, electrons are lost more easily because they have a higher
</p>
<p>collision frequency.

<p>The magnetic mirror was first proposed by Enrico Fermi as a mechanism for the

<p>acceleration of cosmic rays. Protons bouncing between magnetic mirrors
</p>
<p>approaching each other at high velocity could gain energy at each bounce
</p>
<p>(Fig. 2.10). How such mirrors could arise is another story. A further example of
</p>
<p>the mirror effect is the confinement of particles in the Van Allen belts. The

<p>Now we let the magnetic field be uniform and the electric field be nonuniform. For

<p>need to know the particle&rsquo;s orbit, which we are trying to solve for in the first place.
</p>
<p>If the electric field is weak, we may, as an approximation, use the undisturbed orbit
</p>
<p>to evaluate Ex(x). The orbit in the absence of the E field was given in Eq. (2.7):
</p>
<p>x &frac14; x0 &thorn; rL sin ωct &eth;2:52&THORN;

<p>out the gyratory motion by averaging over a cycle. Equation (2.50) then gives
</p>
<p>vx &frac14; 0. In Eq. (2.53), the oscillating term &euro;vy clearly averages to zero, and we have

&eth;2:58&THORN;
</p>
<p>The physical reason for this is easy to see. An ion with its guiding center at a
</p>
<p>maximum of E actually spends a good deal of its time in regions of weaker E. Its
average drift, therefore, is less than E/B evaluated at the guiding center. In a linearly
varying E field, the ion would be in a stronger field on one side of the orbit and in a
field weaker by the same amount on the other side; the correction to vE then cancels
out. From this it is clear that the correction term depends on the second derivative of
</p>
<p>E. For the sinusoidal distribution we assumed, the second derivative is always
negative with respect to E. For an arbitrary variation of E, we need only replace ik
by &nabla; and write Eq. (2.58) as
</p>
<p>vE &frac14; 1&thorn;

r2L&nabla;

<p>2
� �E� B
</p>
<p>B2
&eth;2:59&THORN;
</p>
<p>The second term is called the finite-Larmor-radius effect. What is the significance of
</p>
<p>this correction? Since rL is much larger for ions than for electrons, vE is no longer
independent of species. If a density clump occurs in a plasma, an electric field can
</p>
<p>cause the ions and electrons to separate, generating another electric field. If there is a
</p>
<p>feedback mechanism that causes the second electric field to enhance the first one,
</p>
<p>E grows indefinitely, and the plasma is unstable. Such an instability, called a drift
instability, will be discussed in a later chapter. The grad-B drift, of course, is also a
</p>
<p>finite-Larmor-radius effect and also causes charges to separate. According to
</p>
<p>Eq. (2.24), however, v&nabla;B is proportional to krL, whereas the correction term in
</p>
<p>Eq. (2.58) is proportional to k2r2L. The nonuniform-E-field effect, therefore, is
</p>
<p>important at relatively large k, or small scale lengths of the inhomogeneity. For
</p>
<p>this reason, drift instabilities belong to amore general class calledmicroinstabilities.
</p>
<p>2.5 Time-Varying E Field
</p>
<p>Let us now take E and B to be uniform in space but varying in time. First, consider
the case in which E alone varies sinusoidally in time, and let it lie along the x axis:
</p>
<p>E &frac14; E0e

<p>where the tilde has been added merely to emphasize that the drift is oscillating. The

<p>&euro;vy &frac14; �ω

<p>By analogy with Eq. (2.12), we try a solution which is the sum of a drift and a
</p>
<p>gyratory motion:
</p>
<p>vx &frac14; v&perp;e
iωct &thorn; ev p
</p>
<p>vy &frac14; �iv&perp;e
iωct &thorn; evE

</p>
<p>This is not the same as Eq. (2.63) unless ω2 � ω2c . If we now make the assumption
</p>
<p>that E varies slowly, so thatω2 � ω2c , then Eq. (2.64) is the approximate solution to
Eq. (2.63).
</p>
<p>Equation (2.64) tells us that the guiding center motion has two components. The
</p>
<p>y component, perpendicular to B and E, is the usual E�B drift, except that vE now
oscillates slowly at the frequency ω. The x component, a new drift along the
</p>
<p>direction of E, is called the polarization drift. By replacing iω by &part;/&part;t, we can
generalize Eq. (2.62) and define the polarization drift as
</p>

<p>38 2 Single-Particle Motions</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The physical reason for the polarization current is simple (Fig. 2.12). Consider
</p>
<p>an ion at rest in a magnetic field. If a field E is suddenly applied, the first thing the
ion does is to move in the direction of E. Only after picking up a velocity v does the
ion feel a Lorentz force ev�B and begin to move downward in Fig. (2.12). If
E is now kept constant, there is no further vp drift but only a vE drift. However,
if E is reversed, there is again a momentary drift, this time to the left. Thus vp is a
startup drift due to inertia and occurs only in the first half-cycle of each gyration
</p>
<p>during which E changes. Consequently, vp goes to zero with ω/ωc.
The polarization effect in a plasma is similar to that in a solid dielectric, where
</p>
<p>D &frac14; ε0E&thorn; P. The dipoles in a plasma are ions and electrons separated by a distance
rL. But since ions and electrons can move around to preserve quasineutrality, the
</p>
<p>application of a steady E field does not result in a polarization field P. However, if
E oscillates, an oscillating current jp results from the lag due to the ion inertia.
</p>
<p>2.6 Time-Varying B Field
</p>
<p>Finally, we allow the magnetic field to vary in time. Since the Lorentz force is
</p>
<p>always perpendicular to v, a magnetic field itself cannot impart energy to a charged
particle. However, associated with B is an electric field given by
</p>
<p>&nabla;�E&frac14;� _B &eth;2:68&THORN;
</p>
<p>and this can accelerate the particles. We can no longer assume the fields to be
</p>
<p>completely uniform. Let v&perp;&frac14; dl/dt be the transverse velocity, l being the element of
path along a particle trajectory (with vk neglected). Taking the scalar product of the
</p>
<p>equation of motion (2.8) with v&perp;, we have

<p>The magnetic moment is invariant in slowly varying magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>As the B field varies in strength, the Larmor orbits expand and contract, and the
</p>
<p>particles lose and gain transverse energy. This exchange of energy between the
</p>
<p>particles and the field is described very simply by Eq. (2.73). The invariance of μ
</p>
<p>allows us to prove easily the following well-known theorem:
</p>
<p>The magnetic flux through a Larmor orbit is constant.

<p>to increase B and hence v2&perp;. The heated plasma can then be transferred to the region

<p>2.8 Adiabatic Invariants
</p>
<p>It is well known in classical mechanics that whenever a system has a periodic
</p>
<p>motion, the action integral
</p>
<p>&thorn;
pdq taken over a period is a constant of the motion.
</p>
<p>Here p and q are the generalized momentum and coordinate which repeat them-
</p>
<p>selves in the motion. If a slow change is made in the system, so that the motion is
</p>
<p>not quite periodic, the constant of the motion does not change and is then called an
</p>
<p>adiabatic invariant. By slow here we mean slow compared with the period of
</p>
<p>motion, so that the integral
</p>
<p>&thorn;
pdq is well defined even though it is strictly no longer
</p>
<p>an integral over a closed path. Adiabatic invariants play an important role in plasma
</p>
<p>physics; they allow us to obtain simple answers in many instances involving
</p>
<p>complicated motions. There are three adiabatic invariants, each corresponding to
</p>
<p>a different type of periodic motion.
</p>
<p>2.8.1 The First Adiabatic Invariant, μ
</p>
<p>We have already met the quantity
</p>
<p>μ &frac14; mv2
&perp;
=2B
</p>
<p>and have proved its invariance in spatially and temporally varying B fields. The
periodic motion involved, of course, is the Larmor gyration. If we take p to be
</p>
<p>angular momentum mv&perp;r and dq to be the coordinate dθ, the action integral
</p>
<p>becomes
</p>
<p>&thorn;
pdq &frac14;
</p>
<p>&thorn;
mv&perp;rLdθ &frac14; 2πrLmv&perp; &frac14; 2π
</p>
<p>mv2
&perp;
</p>
<p>ωc
&frac14; 4π
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>qj j
μ &eth;2:75&THORN;
</p>
<p>Thus μ is a constant of the motion as long as q/m is not changed. We have proved
</p>
<p>the invariance of μ only with the implicit assumption ω/ωc� 1, where ω is a
frequency characterizing the rate of change of B as seen by the particle. A proof
exists, however, that μ is invariant even when ω�ωc. In theorists&rsquo; language, μ is
invariant &ldquo;to all orders in an expansion in ω/ωc.&rdquo; What this means in practice is that
</p>
<p>μ remains much more nearly constant than B does during one period of gyration.
</p>
<p>42 2 Single-Particle Motions</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It is just as important to know when an adiabatic invariant does not exist as to
</p>
<p>know when it does. Adiabatic invariance of μ is violated when ω is not small
</p>
<p>compared with ωc. We give three examples of this.
</p>
<p>(A) Magnetic Pumping. If the strength of B in a mirror confinement system is
varied sinusoidally, the particles&rsquo; v&perp; would oscillate; but there would be no
</p>
<p>gain of energy in the long run. However, if the particles make collisions, the
</p>
<p>invariance of μ is violated, and the plasma can be heated. In particular, a
</p>
<p>particle making a collision during the compression phase can transfer part of its
</p>
<p>gyration energy into vk energy, and this is not taken out again in the expansion
</p>
<p>phase.
</p>
<p>(B) Cyclotron Heating. Now imagine that the B field is oscillated at the frequency
</p>
<p>ωc. The induced electric field will then rotate in phase with some of the
</p>
<p>particles and accelerate their Larmor motion continuously. The condition
</p>
<p>ω�ωc is violated, μ is not conserved, and the plasma can be heated.
(C) Magnetic Cusps. If the current in one of the coils in a simple magnetic mirror
</p>
<p>system is reversed, a magnetic cusp is formed (Fig. 2.14). This configuration
</p>
<p>has, in addition to the usual mirrors, a spindle-cusp mirror extending over 360	
</p>
<p>in azimuth. A plasma confined in a cusp device is supposed to have better
</p>
<p>stability properties than that in an ordinary mirror. Unfortunately, the loss-cone
</p>
<p>losses are larger because of the additional loss region; and the particle motion is
</p>
<p>nonadiabatic. Since the B field vanishes at the center of symmetry, ωc is zero
</p>
<p>there; and μ is not preserved. The local Larmor radius near the center is larger
</p>
<p>than the device. Because of this, the adiabatic invariant μ does not guarantee
</p>
<p>that particles outside a loss cone will stay outside after passing through the
</p>
<p>nonadiabatic region. Fortunately, there is in this case another invariant: the
</p>
<p>canonical angular momentum pθ&frac14;mrvθ� erAθ. This ensures that there will be
a population of particles trapped indefinitely until they make a collision.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.8.2 The Second Adiabatic Invariant, J
</p>
<p>Consider a particle trapped between two magnetic mirrors: It bounces between
</p>
<p>them and therefore has a periodic motion at the &ldquo;bounce frequency.&rdquo; A constant of
</p>
<p>this motion is given by
</p>
<p>&thorn;
mvkds, where ds is an element of path length (of the
</p>
<p>guiding center) along a field line. However, since the guiding center drifts across
</p>
<p>field lines, the motion is not exactly periodic, and the constant of the motion
</p>
<p>becomes an adiabatic invariant. This is called the longitudinal invariant J and is
</p>
<p>defined for a half-cycle between the two turning points (Fig. 2.15):
</p>
<p>J &frac14;
</p>
<p>&eth; b
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>vjj ds &eth;2:76&THORN;
</p>
<p>We shall prove that J is invariant in a static, nonuniform B field; the result is also
</p>
<p>true for a slowly time-varying B field.
</p>
<p>Before embarking on this somewhat lengthy proof, let us consider an example of
</p>
<p>the type of problem in which a theorem on the invariance of J would be useful. As
</p>
<p>we have already seen, the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field mirror-traps charged particles,
</p>
<p>which slowly drift in longitude around the earth (Problem 2.8; see Fig. 2.16). If the
</p>
<p>magnetic field were perfectly symmetric, the particle would eventually drift back to
</p>
<p>the same line of force. However, the actual field is distorted by such effects as the
</p>
<p>solar wind. In that case, will a particle ever come back to the same line of force?
</p>
<p>Since the particle&rsquo;s energy is conserved and is equal to 1
2
mv2
</p>
<p>&perp;
at the turning point,
</p>
<p>the invariance of μ indicates that jBj remains the same at the turning point.
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.15 A particle
bouncing between turning
</p>
<p>points a and b in a magnetic
</p>
<p>field

</p>
<p>44 2 Single-Particle Motions</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>However, upon drifting back to the same longitude, a particle may find itself on
</p>
<p>another line of force at a different altitude. This cannot happen if J is conserved. J
</p>
<p>determines the length of the line of force between turning points, and no two lines
</p>
<p>have the same length between points with the same jBj. Consequently, the particle
returns to the same line of force even in a slightly asymmetric field.
</p>
<p>To prove the invariance of J, we first consider the invariance of vkδs, where δs is
</p>
<p>a segment of the path along B (Fig. 2.17). Because of guiding center drifts, a
particle on s will find itself on another line of force δs0 after a time Δt. The length of
</p>
<p>δs0 is defined by passing planes perpendicular to B through the end points of δs. The
length of δs is obviously proportional to the radius of curvature:

</p>
<p>This is not exactly the same as saying that J is constant, however. In taking the
</p>
<p>integral of vkδs between the turning points, it may be that the turning points on δs
0
</p>
<p>do not coincide with the intersections of the perpendicular planes (Fig. 2.17).
</p>
<p>However, any error in J arising from such a discrepancy is negligible because

</p>
<p>46 2 Single-Particle Motions</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>from each other near the bounce frequency. Those particles that have the right
</p>
<p>bounce frequency will always see an approaching mirror and will therefore gain vk.
</p>
<p>J is not conserved in this case because the change of B occurs on a time scale not
long compared with the bounce time.
</p>
<p>2.8.3 The Third Adiabatic Invariant, Ф
</p>
<p>Referring again to Fig. 2.16, we see that the slow drift of a guiding center around the
</p>
<p>earth constitutes a third type of periodic motion. The adiabatic invariant connected
</p>
<p>with this turns out to be the total magnetic flux Ф enclosed by the drift surface. It is
</p>
<p>almost obvious that, as B varies, the particle will stay on a surface such that the total
number of lines of force enclosed remains constant. This invariant, Ф, has few
</p>
<p>applications because most fluctuations of B occur on a time scale short compared
with the drift period. As an example of the violation of Ф invariance, we can cite
</p>
<p>some recent work on the excitation of hydromagnetic waves in the ionosphere.
</p>
<p>These waves have a long period comparable to the drift time of a particle around the
</p>
<p>earth. The particles can therefore encounter the wave in the same phase each time
</p>
<p>around. If the phase is right, the wave can be excited by the conversion of particle
</p>
<p>drift energy to wave energy.
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>2.13. Derive the result of Problem 2.12b directly by using the invariance of J.
</p>
<p>(a) Let
</p>
<p>&eth;
vkds &rsquo; vkL and differentiate with respect to time
</p>
<p>(b) From this, get an expression for T in terms of dL/dt. Set dL/dt&frac14;�2vm to
obtain the answer.
</p>
<p>2.14. In plasma heating by adiabatic compression the invariance of μ requires that
</p>
<p>KT&perp; increase as B increases. The magnetic field, however, cannot accelerate
</p>
<p>particles because the Lorentz force qv�B is always perpendicular to the
velocity. How do the particles gain energy?
</p>
<p>2.15. The polarization drift vp can also be derived from energy conservation. If E is
</p>
<p>oscillating, the E�B drift also oscillates; and there is an energy 1
2
mv2E
</p>
<p>associated with the guiding center motion. Since energy can be gained from
</p>
<p>an E field only by motion along E, there must be a drift vp in the E direction.
</p>
<p>By equating the rate of change of 1
2
mv2E with the rate of energy gain from
</p>
<p>vp &middot;E, find the required value of vp.

<p>3.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>In a plasma the situation is much more complicated than that in the last chapter; the
</p>
<p>E and B fields are not prescribed but are determined by the positions and motions of
the charges themselves. One must solve a self-consistent problem; that is, find a set
</p>
<p>of particle trajectories and field patterns such that the particles will generate the
</p>
<p>fields as they move along their orbits and the fields will cause the particles to move
</p>
<p>in those exact orbits. And this must be done in a time-varying situation. It sounds
</p>
<p>very hard, but it is not.
</p>
<p>We have seen that a typical plasma density might be 1018 ion&ndash;electron pairs per
</p>
<p>m3. If each of these particles follows a complicated trajectory and it is necessary to
</p>
<p>follow each of these, predicting the plasma&rsquo;s behavior would be a hopeless task.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is not usually necessary because, surprisingly, the majority&mdash;
</p>
<p>perhaps as much as 80 %&mdash;of plasma phenomena observed in real experiments
</p>
<p>can be explained by a rather crude model. This model is that used in fluid
</p>
<p>mechanics, in which the identity of the individual particle is neglected, and only
</p>
<p>the motion of fluid elements is taken into account. Of course, in the case of plasmas,
</p>
<p>the fluid contains electrical charges. In an ordinary fluid, frequent collisions
</p>
<p>between particles keep the particles in a fluid element moving together. It is
</p>
<p>surprising that such a model works for plasmas, which generally have infrequent
</p>
<p>collisions. But we shall see that there is a reason for this.
</p>
<p>In the greater part of this book, we shall be concerned with what can be learned
</p>
<p>from the fluid theory of plasmas. A more refined treatment&mdash;the kinetic theory of
</p>
<p>plasmas&mdash;requires more mathematical calculation than is appropriate for an intro-
</p>
<p>ductory course. An introduction to kinetic theory is given in Chap. 7.

<p>In some plasma problems, neither fluid theory nor kinetic theory is sufficient to
</p>
<p>describe the plasma&rsquo;s behavior. Then one has to fall back on the tedious process of
</p>
<p>following the individual trajectories. Modern computers can do this, although they
</p>
<p>have only enoughmemory to store the position and velocity components for about 106
</p>
<p>particles if all three dimensions are involved. Nonetheless, computer simulation plays
</p>
<p>an important role in filling the gap between theory and experiment in those instances
</p>
<p>where even kinetic theory cannot come close to explaining what is observed.

<p>B &frac14; μH &eth;3:10&THORN;
</p>
<p>In Eqs. (3.5) and (3.8), σ and j stand for the &ldquo;free&rdquo; charge and current densities. The
&ldquo;bound&rdquo; charge and current densities arising from polarization and magnetization
</p>
<p>of the medium are included in the definition of the quantities D and H in terms of ε
and μ. In a plasma, the ions and electrons comprising the plasma are the equivalent
</p>
<p>of the &ldquo;bound&rdquo; charges and currents. Since these charges move in a complicated way,
</p>
<p>it is impractical to try to lump their effects into two constants ε and μ. Consequently,
</p>
<p>in plasma physics, one generally works with the vacuum equations (3.1)&ndash;(3.4), in
</p>
<p>which σ and j include all the charges and currents, both external and internal.

<p>Note that we have used E and B in the vacuum equations rather than their
counterparts D and H, which are related by the constants ε0 and μ0. This is because
the forces qE and j�B depend on E and B rather than D and H, and it is not
necessary to introduce the latter quantities as long as one is dealing with the vacuum
</p>
<p>equations.
</p>
<p>3.2.2 Classical Treatment of Magnetic Materials
</p>
<p>Since each gyrating particle has a magnetic moment, it would seem that the logical
</p>
<p>thing to do would be to consider a plasma as a magnetic material with a perme-
</p>
<p>ability μm. (We have put a subscript m on the permeability to distinguish it from the
</p>
<p>adiabatic invariant μ.) To see why this is not done in practice, let us review the way
</p>
<p>magnetic materials are usually treated.
</p>
<p>The ferromagnetic domains, say, of a piece of iron have magnetic moments μi,
</p>
<p>giving rise to a bulk magnetization
</p>
<p>M &frac14;
1
</p>
<p>V
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>μi &eth;3:11&THORN;
</p>
<p>per unit volume. This has the same effect as a bound current density equal to
</p>
<p>jb &frac14; &nabla; �M &eth;3:12&THORN;
</p>
<p>In the vacuum equation (3.4), we must include in j both this current and the &ldquo;free,&rdquo;
or externally applied, current jf:
</p>
<p>μ�10 &nabla; � B &frac14; j f &thorn; jb &thorn; ε0
_E &eth;3:13&THORN;
</p>
<p>We wish to write Eq. (3.13) in the simple form
</p>
<p>&nabla; �H &frac14; j f &thorn; ε0
_E &eth;3:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>by including jb in the definition of H. This can be done if we let
</p>
<p>H &frac14; μ�10 B�M &eth;3:15&THORN;
</p>
<p>To get a simple relation between B and H, we assume M to be proportional to B or
H:
</p>
<p>M &frac14; χmH &eth;3:16&THORN;
</p>
<p>3.2 Relation of Plasma Physics to Ordinary Electromagnetics 53</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The constant χm is the magnetic susceptibility. We now have
</p>
<p>B &frac14; μ0 1&thorn; χm&eth; &THORN;H � μmH &eth;3:17&THORN;
</p>
<p>This simple relation between B and H is possible because of the linear form of
Eq. (3.16).
</p>
<p>In a plasma with a magnetic field, each particle has a magnetic moment μα, and
</p>
<p>the quantity M is the sum of all these μα&rsquo;s in 1 m
3. But we now have
</p>
<p>μα &frac14;
mv2
</p>
<p>&perp;α
</p>
<p>2B
/
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>B
M /
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>B
</p>
<p>The relation between M and H (or B) is no longer linear, and we cannot write
B&frac14; μmH with μm constant. It is therefore not useful to consider a plasma as a
magnetic medium.
</p>
<p>3.2.3 Classical Treatment of Dielectrics
</p>
<p>The polarization P per unit volume is the sum over all the individual moments pi of
the electric dipoles. This gives rise to a bound charge density
</p>
<p>σb &frac14; �&nabla; � P &eth;3:18&THORN;
</p>
<p>In the vacuum equation (3.1), we must include both the bound charge and the free
</p>
<p>charge:
</p>
<p>ε0&nabla; � E &frac14; σ f &thorn; σb
� �
</p>
<p>&eth;3:19&THORN;
</p>
<p>We wish to write this in the simple form
</p>
<p>&nabla; � D &frac14; σ f &eth;3:20&THORN;
</p>
<p>by including σb in the definition of D. This can be done by letting
</p>
<p>D &frac14; ε0E&thorn; P � ε E &eth;3:21&THORN;
</p>
<p>If P is linearly proportional to E,
</p>
<p>P &frac14; ε0χeE &eth;3:22&THORN;
</p>
<p>then ε is a constant given by
</p>
<p>ε &frac14; 1&thorn; χe&eth; &THORN;ε0 &eth;3:23&THORN;
</p>
<p>54 3 Plasmas as Fluids</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>There is no a priori reason why a relation like Eq. (3.22) cannot be valid in a plasma,
</p>
<p>so we may proceed to try to get an expression for ε in a plasma.
</p>
<p>3.2.4 The Dielectric Constant of a Plasma
</p>
<p>We have seen in Sect. 2.5 that a fluctuating E field gives rise to a polarization
current jp. This leads, in turn, to a polarization charge given by the equation of
continuity:
</p>
<p>&part;σ p
</p>
<p>&part;t
&thorn; &nabla; � j p &frac14; 0 &eth;3:24&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is the equivalent of Eq. (3.18), except that, as we noted before, a polarization
</p>
<p>effect does not arise in a plasma unless the electric field is time varying. Since we
</p>
<p>have an explicit expression for jp but not for σp, it is easier to work with the fourth
Maxwell equation, Eq. (3.4):
</p>
<p>&nabla; � B &frac14; μ0 j f &thorn; j p &thorn; ε0
_E
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>&eth;3:25&THORN;
</p>
<p>We wish to write this in the form
</p>
<p>&nabla; � B &frac14; μ0 j f &thorn; ε
_E
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>&eth;3:26&THORN;
</p>
<p>This can be done if we let
</p>
<p>ε &frac14; ε0 &thorn;
j p
_E
</p>
<p>&eth;3:27&THORN;
</p>
<p>From Eq. (2.67) for jp, we have
</p>
<p>ε &frac14; ε0 &thorn;
ρ
</p>
<p>B2
or εR �
</p>
<p>ε
</p>
<p>ε0
&frac14; 1&thorn;
</p>
<p>μ0ρc
2
</p>
<p>B2
&eth;3:28&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is the low-frequency plasma dielectric constant for transverse motions. The
</p>
<p>qualifications are necessary because our expression for jp is valid only forω
2 � ω2c
</p>
<p>and for E perpendicular to B. The general expression for ε, of course, is very
complicated and hardly fits on one page.
</p>
<p>Note that as ρ! 0, εR approaches its vacuum value, unity, as it should. As
B!1, εR also approaches unity. This is because the polarization drift vp then
vanishes, and the particles do not move in response to the transverse electric field.
</p>
<p>In a usual laboratory plasma, the second term in Eq. (3.28) is large compared with
</p>
<p>unity. For instance, if n&frac14; 1016 m�3 and B&frac14; 0.1 T we have (for hydrogen)
</p>

</p>
<p>This means that the electric fields due to the particles in the plasma greatly alter the
</p>
<p>fields applied externally. A plasma with large ε shields out alternating fields, just as
</p>
<p>a plasma with small λD shields out dc fields.

that of the vacuum Poisson equation (3.1), with the help of equations (3.24) and

</p>
<p>3.3 The Fluid Equation of Motion
</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s equations tell us what E and B are for a given state of the plasma. To
solve the self-consistent problem, we must also have an equation giving the
</p>
<p>plasma&rsquo;s response to given E and B. In the fluid approximation, we consider the
plasma to be composed of two or more interpenetrating fluids, one for each species.
</p>
<p>In the simplest case, when there is only one species of ion, we shall need two
</p>
<p>equations of motion, one for the positively charged ion fluid and one for the
</p>
<p>negatively charged electron fluid. In a partially ionized gas, we shall also need an
</p>
<p>equation for the fluid of neutral atoms. The neutral fluid will interact with the ions
</p>
<p>and electrons only through collisions. The ion and electron fluids will interact with
</p>
<p>each other even in the absence of collisions, because of the E and B fields they
generate.
</p>
<p>3.3.1 The Convective Derivative
</p>
<p>The equation of motion for a single particle is
</p>
<p>m
dv
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14; q E&thorn; v� B&eth; &THORN; &eth;3:29&THORN;
</p>
<p>56 3 Plasmas as Fluids</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Assume first that there are no collisions and no thermal motions. Then all the
</p>
<p>particles in a fluid element move together, and the average velocity u of
the particles in the element is the same as the individual particle velocity v.
The fluid equation is obtained simply by multiplying Eq. (3.29) by the density n:
</p>
<p>mn
du
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14; qn E&thorn; u�B&eth; &THORN; &eth;3:30&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is, however, not a convenient form to use. In Eq. (3.29), the time derivative is
</p>
<p>to be taken at the position of the particles. On the other hand, we wish to have an
</p>
<p>equation for fluid elements fixed in space, because it would be impractical to do
</p>
<p>otherwise. Consider a drop of cream in a cup of coffee as a fluid element. As the
</p>
<p>coffee is stirred, the drop distorts into a filament and finally disperses all over the
</p>
<p>cup, losing its identity. A fluid element at a fixed spot in the cup, however, retains its
</p>
<p>identity although particles continually go in and out of it.
</p>
<p>To make the transformation to variables in a fixed frame, consider G(x, t) to be
any property of a fluid in one-dimensional x space. The change of G with time in a
frame moving with the fluid is the sum of two terms:
</p>
<p>dG x; t&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14;
</p>
<p>&part;G
</p>
<p>&part;t
&thorn;
&part;G
</p>
<p>&part;x
</p>
<p>dx
</p>
<p>&part;t
&frac14;
</p>
<p>&part;G
</p>
<p>&part;t
&thorn; ux
</p>
<p>&part;G
</p>
<p>&part;x
&eth;3:31&THORN;
</p>
<p>The first term on the right represents the change of G at a fixed point in space, and
the second term represents the change ofG as the observer moves with the fluid into
a region in which G is different. In three dimensions, Eq. (3.31) generalizes to
</p>
<p>dG
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14;
</p>
<p>&part;G
</p>
<p>&part;t
&thorn; u � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;G &eth;3:32&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is called the convective derivative and is sometimes written DG/Dt. Note that
</p>
<p>(u &middot;&nabla;) is a scalar differential operator. Since the sign of this term is sometimes a
source of confusion, we give two simple examples.
</p>
<p>Figure 3.1 shows an electric water heater in which the hot water has risen to the
</p>
<p>top and the cold water has sunk to the bottom. Let G(x, t) be the temperature T; &nabla;G
</p>
<p>is then upward. Consider a fluid element near the edge of the tank. If the heater
</p>
<p>element is turned on, the fluid element is heated as it moves, and we have dT/dt&gt; 0.
If, in addition, a paddle wheel sets up a flow pattern as shown, the temperature in a
</p>
<p>fixed fluid element is lowered by the convection of cold water from the bottom. In
</p>
<p>this case, we have &part;T/&part;x&gt; 0 and ux&gt; 0, so that u � &nabla;T &gt; 0. The temperature
change in the fixed element, &part;T/&part;t, is given by a balance of these effects,
</p>
<p>&part;T
</p>
<p>&part;t
&frac14;
</p>
<p>dT
</p>
<p>dt
� u � &nabla;T &eth;3:33&THORN;
</p>
<p>It is quite clear that &part;T/&part;t can be made zero, at least for a short time.
</p>
<p>3.3 The Fluid Equation of Motion 57</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As a second example we may take G to be the salinity S of the water near the
</p>
<p>mouth of a river (Fig. 3.2). If x is the upstream direction, there is normally a
</p>
<p>gradient of S such that &part;S/&part;x&lt; 0. When the tide comes in, the entire interface
between salt and fresh water moves upstream, and ux&gt; 0. Thus
</p>
<p>&part;S
</p>
<p>&part;t
&frac14; �ux
</p>
<p>&part;S
</p>
<p>&part;x
&gt; 0 &eth;3:34&THORN;
</p>
<p>meaning that the salinity increases at any given point. Of course, if it rains, the
</p>
<p>salinity decreases everywhere, and a negative term dS/dt is to be added to the
</p>
<p>middle part of Eq. (3.34).
</p>
<p>As a final example, take G to be the density of cars near a freeway entrance at
</p>
<p>rush hour. A driver will see the density around him increasing as he approaches the
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.1 Motion of fluid
elements in a hot water

<p>crowded freeway. This is the convective term u � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;G. At the same time, the local
streets may be filling with cars that enter from driveways, so that the density will
</p>
<p>increase even if the observer does not move. This is the &part;G/&part;t term. The total
</p>
<p>increase seen by the observer is the sum of these effects.
</p>
<p>In the case of a plasma, we take G to be the fluid velocity u and write Eq. (3.30)
as
</p>
<p>mn
&part;u
</p>
<p>&part;t
&thorn; u � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;u

<p>&frac14; qn E&thorn; u�B&eth; &THORN; &eth;3:35&THORN;
</p>
<p>where &part;u/&part;t is the time derivative in a fixed frame.
</p>
<p>3.3.2 The Stress Tensor
</p>
<p>When thermal motions are taken into account, a pressure force has to be added to
</p>
<p>the right-hand side of Eq. (3.35). This force arises from the random motion of
</p>
<p>particles in and out of a fluid element and does not appear in the equation for a
</p>
<p>single particle. Let a fluid element Δx Δy Δz be centered at (x0,
1
2
Δy, 1
</p>
<p>2
Δz) (Fig. 3.3).
</p>
<p>For simplicity, we shall consider only the x component of motion through the faces
</p>
<p>A and B. The number of particles per second passing through the face A with
</p>
<p>velocity vx is
</p>
<p>Δnv vxΔyΔz
</p>
<p>where Δnv is the number of particles per m
3 with velocity vx:

<p>What we have derived is only a special case: the transfer of x momentum by
</p>
<p>motion in the x direction; and we have assumed that the fluid is isotropic, so that the
</p>
<p>same result holds in the y and z directions. But it is also possible to transfer
</p>
<p>y momentum by motion in the x direction, for instance. Suppose, in Fig. 3.3, that
</p>
<p>uy is zero in the cube at x&frac14; x0 but is positive on both sides. Then as particles migrate
across the faces A and B, they bring in more positive y momentum than they take
</p>
<p>out, and the fluid element gains momentum in the y direction. This shear stress
</p>
<p>cannot be represented by a scalar p but must be given by a tensor P, the stress
tensor, whose components Pi j &frac14; mnviv j specify both the direction of motion and
the component of momentum involved. In the general case the term �&nabla; p is
replaced by �&nabla; � P.
</p>
<p>We shall not give the stress tensor here except for the two simplest cases. When
</p>
<p>the distribution function is an isotropic Maxwellian, P is written

<p>where the coordinate of the third row or column is the direction of B. This is still
diagonal and shows isotropy in a plane perpendicular to B.
</p>
<p>In an ordinary fluid, the off-diagonal elements of P are usually associated with
viscosity. When particles make collisions, they come off with an average velocity
</p>
<p>in the direction of the fluid velocity u at the point where they made their last
collision. This momentum is transferred to another fluid element upon the next
</p>
<p>collision. This tends to equalize u at different points, and the resulting resistance to
shear flow is what we intuitively think of as viscosity. The longer the mean free
</p>
<p>path, the farther momentum is carried, and the larger is the viscosity. In a plasma
</p>
<p>there is a similar effect which occurs even in the absence of collisions. The Larmor
</p>
<p>gyration of particles (particularly ions) brings them into different parts of the
</p>
<p>plasma and tends to equalize the fluid velocities there. The Larmor radius rather
</p>
<p>than the mean free path sets the scale of this kind of collisionless viscosity. It is a
</p>
<p>finite-Larmor-radius effect which occurs in addition to collisional viscosity and is
</p>
<p>closely related to the vE drift in a nonuniform E field (Eq. (2.58)).
</p>
<p>3.3.3 Collisions
</p>
<p>If there is a neutral gas, the charged fluid will exchange momentum with it through
</p>
<p>collisions. The momentum lost per collision will be proportional to the relative
</p>
<p>velocity u� u0, where u0 is the velocity of the neutral fluid. If τ, the mean free time
between collisions, is approximately constant, the resulting force term can be
</p>
<p>roughly written as �mn(u� u0)/τ. The equation of motion (3.44) can be general-
ized to include anisotropic pressure and neutral collisions as follows:

</p>
<p>This is the same as the plasma equation (3.47) except for the absence of electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic forces and collisions between species (there being only one species). The
</p>
<p>viscosity term ρν&nabla;2u, where ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient, is just the
collisional part of &nabla; � P� &nabla; p in the absence of magnetic fields. Equation (3.48)
describes a fluid in which there are frequent collisions between particles. Equation
</p>
<p>(3.47), on the other hand, was derived without any explicit statement of the collision
</p>
<p>rate. Since the two equations are identical except for the E and B terms, can
Eq. (3.47) really describe a plasma species? The answer is a guarded yes, and the
</p>
<p>reasons for this will tell us the limitations of the fluid theory.
</p>
<p>In the derivation of Eq. (3.47), we did actually assume implicitly that there were
</p>
<p>many collisions. This assumption came in Eq. (3.39) when we took the velocity
</p>
<p>distribution to be Maxwellian. Such a distribution generally comes about as the
</p>
<p>result of frequent collisions. However, this assumption was used only to take the
</p>
<p>average of v2xr. Any other distribution with the same average would give us the same
</p>
<p>answer. The fluid theory, therefore, is not very sensitive to deviations from the
</p>
<p>Maxwellian distribution, but there are instances in which these deviations are
</p>
<p>important. Kinetic theory must then be used.
</p>
<p>There is also an empirical observation by Irving Langmuir which helps the fluid
</p>
<p>theory. In working with the electrostatic probes which bear his name, Langmuir
</p>
<p>discovered that the electron distribution function was far more nearly Maxwellian
</p>
<p>than could be accounted for by the collision rate. This phenomenon, called
</p>
<p>Langmuir&rsquo;s paradox, has been attributed at times to high-frequency oscillations.
</p>
<p>There has been no satisfactory resolution of the paradox, but this seems to be one of
</p>
<p>the few instances in plasma physics where nature works in our favor.
</p>
<p>Another reason the fluid model works for plasmas is that the magnetic field,
</p>
<p>when there is one, can play the role of collisions in a certain sense. When a particle
</p>
<p>is accelerated, say by an E field, it would continuously increase in velocity if it were
allowed to free-stream. When there are frequent collisions, the particle comes to a
</p>
<p>limiting velocity proportional to E. The electrons in a copper wire, for instance,
drift together with a velocity v&frac14; μE, where μ is the mobility. A magnetic field also
limits free-streaming by forcing particles to gyrate in Larmor orbits. The electrons
</p>
<p>in a plasma also drift together with a velocity proportional to E, namely,
</p>
<p>vE &frac14; E� B=B
2. In this sense, a collisionless plasma behaves like a collisional
</p>
<p>fluid. Of course, particles do free-stream along the magnetic field, and the fluid
</p>
<p>picture is not particularly suitable for motions in that direction. For motions
</p>
<p>perpendicular to B, the fluid theory is a good approximation.

<p>3.3.5 Equation of Continuity
</p>
<p>The conservation of matter requires that the total number of particles N in a volume
</p>
<p>V can change only if there is a net flux of particles across the surface S bounding that
</p>
<p>volume. Since the particle flux density is nu, we have, by the divergence theorem,

&thorn; &nabla; � nu&eth; &THORN; &frac14; 0 &eth;3:50&THORN;
</p>
<p>There is one such equation of continuity for each species. Any sources or sinks of
</p>
<p>particles are to be added to the right-hand side.
</p>
<p>3.3.6 Equation of State
</p>
<p>One more relation is needed to close the system of equations. For this, we can use
</p>
<p>the thermodynamic equation of state relating p to n:
</p>
<p>p &frac14; Cργ &eth;3:51&THORN;
</p>
<p>where C is a constant and γ is the ratio of specific heats Cp/Cv. The term &nabla;p is
</p>
<p>therefore given by
</p>
<p>&nabla; p
</p>
<p>p
&frac14; γ
</p>
<p>&nabla;n
</p>
<p>n
&eth;3:52&THORN;
</p>
<p>For isothermal compression, we have
</p>
<p>&nabla; p &frac14; &nabla; nKT&eth; &THORN; &frac14; KT&nabla;n
</p>
<p>so that, clearly, γ&frac14; 1. For adiabatic compression, KT will also change, giving γ a
value larger than one. If N is the number of degrees of freedom, γ is given by
</p>
<p>γ &frac14; 2&thorn; N&eth; &THORN;=N &eth;3:53&THORN;
</p>
<p>The validity of the equation of state requires that heat flow be negligible; that is, that
</p>
<p>thermal conductivity be low. Again, this is more likely to be true in directions
</p>
<p>perpendicular to B than parallel to it. Fortunately, most basic phenomena can be
described adequately by the crude assumption of Eq. (3.51).

<p>There are 16 scalar unknowns: ni, ne, pi, pe, vi, ve, E, and B. There are apparently
18 scalar equations if we count each vector equation as three scalar equations.
</p>
<p>However, two of Maxwell&rsquo;s equations are superfluous, since Eqs. (3.55) and (3.57)
</p>
<p>can be recovered from the divergences of Eqs. (3.58) and (3.56) (Problem 3.3). The

</p>
<p>Since a fluid element is composed of many individual particles, one would expect
</p>
<p>the fluid to have drifts perpendicular to B if the individual guiding centers have such
drifts. However, since the &nabla;p term appears only in the fluid equations, there is a drift
</p>
<p>associated with it which the fluid elements have but the particles do not have. For

<p>each species, we have an equation of motion

<p>Here we have taken &part;/&part;t&frac14; iω and are concerned only with v&perp;. For drifts slow
compared with the time scale of ωc, we may neglect term ①. We shall also neglect
</p>
<p>the v � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;v term and show a posteriori that this is all right. Let E and B be uniform,
but let n and p have a gradient. This is the usual situation in a magnetically confined
</p>
<p>plasma column (Fig. 3.4). Taking the cross product of Eq. (3.62) with B, we have

<p>The drift vE is the same as for guiding centers, but there is now a new drift vD, called
the diamagnetic drift. Since vD is perpendicular to the direction of the gradient,
our neglect of v � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;v is justified if E&frac14; 0. If E &frac14; �&nabla;ϕ 6&frac14; 0, v � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;v is still zero if

<p>left, as indicated by the density of orbits. Through any fixed volume element there
</p>
<p>are more ions moving downward than upward, since the downward-moving ions
</p>
<p>come from a region of higher density. There is, therefore, a fluid drift perpendicular
</p>
<p>to &nabla;n and B, even though the guiding centers are stationary. The diamagnetic drift
reverses sign with q because the direction of gyration reverses. The magnitude of vD

</p>
<p>In the particle picture, one would not expect to measure a current if the guiding
</p>
<p>centers do not drift. In the fluid picture, the current jD flows wherever there is a
pressure gradient. These two viewpoints can be reconciled if one considers that all
</p>
<p>experiments must be carried out in a finite-sized plasma. Suppose the plasma were
</p>
<p>in a rigid box (Fig. 3.6). If one were to calculate the current from the single-particle
</p>
<p>picture, one would have to take into account the particles at the edges which have

<p>cycloidal paths. Since there are more particles on the left than on the right, there is a
</p>
<p>net current downward, in agreement with the fluid picture.
</p>
<p>The reader may not be satisfied with this explanation because it was necessary to
</p>
<p>specify reflecting walls. If the walls were absorbing or if they were removed, one
</p>
<p>would find that electric fields would develop because more of one species&mdash;the one
</p>
<p>with larger Larmor radius&mdash;would collected than the other. Then the guiding
</p>
<p>centers would drift, and the simplicity of the model would be lost. Alternatively,
</p>
<p>one could imagine trying to measure the diamagnetic current with a current probe
</p>
<p>(Fig. 3.7). This is just a transformer with a core of magnetic material. The primary
</p>
<p>winding is the plasma current threading the core, and the secondary is a multiturn
</p>
<p>winding all around the core. Let the whole thing be infinitesimally thin, so it does
</p>
<p>not intercept any particles. It is clear from Fig. 3.7 that a net upward current would
</p>
<p>be measured, there being higher density on the left than on the right, so that the
</p>
<p>diamagnetic current is a real current. From this example, one can see that it can be
</p>
<p>quite tricky to work with the single-particle picture. The fluid theory usually gives
</p>
<p>the right results when applied straightforwardly, even though it contains &ldquo;fictitious&rdquo;
</p>
<p>drifts like the diamagnetic drift.
</p>
<p>What about the grad-B and curvature drifts which appeared in the single-particle
</p>
<p>picture? The curvature drift also exists in the fluid picture, since the centrifugal
</p>
<p>force is felt by all the particles in a fluid element as they move around a bend in the
</p>
<p>magnetic field. A term Fc f &frac14; nmv2k=Rc &frac14; nKTk=Rc has to be added to the right-
</p>
<p>hand side of the fluid equation of motion. This is equivalent to a gravitational force

<p>3.4 Fluid Drifts Perpendicular to B 69</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The grad-B drift, however, does not exist for fluids. It can be shown on thermo-
</p>
<p>dynamic grounds that a magnetic field does not affect a Maxwellian distribution.
</p>
<p>This is because the Lorentz force is perpendicular to v and cannot change the
energy of any particle. The most probable distribution f(v) in the absence of B is
also the most probable distribution in the presence of B. If f(v) remains Maxwellian
in a nonuniform B field, and there is no density gradient, then the net momentum
carried into any fixed fluid element is zero. There is no fluid drift even though the
</p>
<p>individual guiding centers have drifts; the particle drifts in any fixed fluid element
</p>
<p>cancel out. To see this pictorially, consider the orbits of two particles moving
</p>
<p>through a fluid element in a nonuniform B field (Fig. 3.8). Since there is no
E field, the Larmor radius changes only because of the gradient in B; there is no
acceleration, and the particle energy remains constant during the motion. If the two
</p>
<p>particles have the same energy, they will have the same velocity and Larmor radius
</p>
<p>while inside the fluid element. There is thus a perfect cancellation between particle
</p>
<p>pairs when their velocities are added to give the fluid velocity.
</p>
<p>When there is a nonuniform E field, it is not easy to reconcile the fluid and
particle pictures. Then the finite-Larmor-radius effect of Sect. 2.4 causes both a
</p>
<p>guiding center drift and a fluid drift, but these are not the same; in fact, they have
</p>
<p>opposite signs! The particle drift was calculated in Chap. 2, and the fluid drift can be
</p>
<p>calculated from the off-diagonal elements of P. It is extremely difficult to explain
how the finite-Larmor-radius effects differ. A simple picture like Fig. 3.6 will not
</p>
<p>work because one has to take into account subtle points like the following: In the
</p>
<p>presence of a density gradient, the density of guiding centers is not the same as the
</p>
<p>density of particles!

</p>
<p>This is just the Boltzmann relation for electrons.
</p>
<p>What this means physically is that electrons, being light, are very mobile and
</p>
<p>would be accelerated to high energies very quickly if there were a net force on
</p>
<p>them. Since electrons cannot leave a region en massewithout leaving behind a large
</p>
<p>ion charge, the electrostatic and pressure gradient forces on the electrons must be
</p>
<p>closely in balance. This condition leads to the Boltzmann relation. Note that
</p>
<p>Eq. (3.73) applies to each line of force separately. Different lines of force may be
</p>
<p>charged to different potentials arbitrarily unless a mechanism is provided for the
</p>
<p>electrons to move across B. The conductors on which lines of force terminate can
provide such a mechanism, and the experimentalist has to take these end effects into
</p>
<p>account carefully.
</p>
<p>Figure 3.9 shows graphically what occurs when there is a local density clump in
</p>
<p>the plasma. Let the density gradient be toward the center of the diagram, and
</p>
<p>suppose KT is constant. There is then a pressure gradient toward the center. Since
</p>
<p>the plasma is quasineutral, the gradient exists for both the electron and ion fluids.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Consider the pressure gradient force Fp on the electron fluid. It drives the mobile
electrons away from the center, leaving the ions behind. The resulting positive
</p>
<p>charge generates a field E whose force FE on the electrons opposes Fp. Only when
FE is equal and opposite to Fp is a steady state achieved. If B is constant, E is an
electrostatic field E &frac14; �&nabla;ϕ, and ϕ must be large at the center, where n is large.
This is just what Eq. (3.73) tells us. The deviation from strict neutrality adjusts itself
</p>
<p>so that there is just enough charge to set up the E field required to balance the forces
on the electrons.
</p>
<p>3.6 The Plasma Approximation
</p>
<p>The previous example reveals an important characteristic of plasmas that has wide
</p>
<p>application. We are used to solving for E from Poisson&rsquo;s equation when we are
given the charge density σ. In a plasma, the opposite procedure is generally used.
</p>
<p>E is found from the equations of motion, and Poisson&rsquo;s equation is used only to find
σ. The reason is that a plasma has an overriding tendency to remain neutral. If the
</p>
<p>ions move, the electrons will follow. E must adjust itself so that the orbits of the
electrons and ions preserve neutrality. The charge density is of secondary impor-
</p>
<p>tance; it will adjust itself so that Poisson&rsquo;s equation is satisfied. This is true, of
</p>
<p>course, only for low-frequency motions in which the electron inertia is not a factor.
</p>
<p>In a plasma, it is usually possible to assume ni&frac14; ne and &nabla; � E 6&frac14; 0 at the same
time. We shall call this the plasma approximation. It is a fundamental trait of
</p>
<p>plasmas, one which is difficult for the novice to understand. Do not use Poisson&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>equation to obtain E unless it is unavoidable! In the set of fluid equations (3.55)&ndash;
(3.61), we may now eliminate Poisson&rsquo;s equation and also eliminate one of the
</p>
<p>unknowns by setting ni&frac14; ne&frac14; n.

</p>
<p>3.6 The Plasma Approximation 73</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The plasma approximation is almost the same as the condition of quasineutrality
</p>
<p>discussed earlier but has a more exact meaning. Whereas quasineutrality refers to a
</p>
<p>general tendency for a plasma to be neutral in its state of rest, the plasma approx-
</p>
<p>imation is a mathematical shortcut that one can use even for wave motions. As long
</p>
<p>as these motions are slow enough that both ions and electrons have time to move, it
</p>
<p>is a good approximation to replace Poisson&rsquo;s equation by the equation ni&frac14; ne. Of
course, if only one species can move and the other cannot follow, such as in high-
</p>
<p>frequency electron waves, then the plasma approximation is not valid, and E must
be found from Maxwell&rsquo;s equations rather than from the ion and electron equations
</p>
<p>of motion. We shall return to the question of the validity of the plasma approxima-
</p>
<p>tion when we come to the theory of ion waves. At that time, it will become clear
</p>
<p>why we had to use Poisson&rsquo;s equation in the derivation of Debye shielding.

<p>Waves in Plasmas
</p>
<p>4.1 Representation of Waves
</p>
<p>Any periodic motion of a fluid can be decomposed by Fourier analysis into a
</p>
<p>superposition of sinusoidal oscillations with different frequencies ω and wave-
</p>
<p>lengths λ. A simple wave is any one of these components. When the oscillation
</p>
<p>amplitude is small, the waveform is generally sinusoidal; and there is only one
</p>
<p>component. This is the situation we shall consider.
</p>
<p>Any sinusoidally oscillating quantity&mdash;say, the density n&mdash;can be represented as
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>n &frac14; n exp i k � r� ωt&eth; &THORN;&frac12; � &eth;4:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>where, in Cartesian coordinates,
</p>
<p>k � r &frac14; kxx&thorn; kyy&thorn; kzz &eth;4:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here n is a constant defining the amplitude of the wave, and k is called the
propagation constant. If the wave propagates in the x direction, k has only an
x component, and Eq. (4.1) becomes
</p>
<p>n &frac14; nei kx�ωt&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>By convention, the exponential notation means that the real part of the expression
</p>
<p>is to be taken as the measurable quantity. Let us choose n to be real; we shall
</p>
<p>soon see that this corresponds to a choice of the origins of x and t. The real part of

<p>n is then

</p>
<p>This is called the phase velocity. If ω/k is positive, the wave moves to the right; that
</p>
<p>is, x increases as t increases, so as to keep kx�ωt constant. If ω/k is negative, the
wave moves to the left. We could equally well have taken
</p>
<p>n &frac14; nei kx&thorn;ωt&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>in which case positive ω/k would have meant negative phase velocity. This is a
</p>
<p>convention that is sometimes used, but we shall not adopt it. From Eq. (4.3), it is
</p>
<p>clear that reversing the sign of both ω and k makes no difference.
</p>
<p>Consider now another oscillating quantity in the wave, say the electric field E.
Since we have already chosen the phase of n to be zero, we must allow E to have a
different phase δ:
</p>
<p>E &frac14; E cos kx� ωt&thorn; δ&eth; &THORN; or E &frac14; Eei kx�ωt&thorn;δ&eth; &THORN; &eth;4:5&THORN;
</p>
<p>where �E is a real, constant vector.
</p>
<p>It is customary to incorporate the phase information into �E by allowing �E to be
</p>
<p>complex. We can write
</p>
<p>E &frac14; Eeiδei kx�ωt&eth; &THORN; � Ec ei kx�ωt&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>where �Ec is a complex amplitude. The phase δ can be recovered from �Ec, since Re

<p>From now on, we shall assume that all amplitudes are complex and drop the

<p>subscript c. Any oscillating quantity g1 will be written
</p>
<p>g1 &frac14; g1exp i k � r� ωt&eth; &THORN;&frac12; � &eth;4:7&THORN;
</p>
<p>so that g1 can stand for either the complex amplitude or the entire expression
Eq. (4.7). There can be no confusion, because in linear wave theory the same
</p>
<p>exponential factor will occur on both sides of any equation and can be

<p>4.2 Group Velocity
</p>
<p>The phase velocity of a wave in a plasma often exceeds the velocity of light c. This
</p>
<p>does not violate the theory of relativity, because an infinitely long wave train of
</p>
<p>constant amplitude cannot carry information. The carrier of a radio wave, for
</p>
<p>instance, carries no information until it is modulated. The modulation information
</p>
<p>does not travel at the phase velocity but at the group velocity, which is always less
</p>
<p>than c. To illustrate this, we may consider a modulated wave formed by adding
</p>
<p>(&ldquo;beating&rdquo;) two waves of nearly equal frequencies. Let these waves be
</p>
<p>E1 &frac14; E0 cos k &thorn; Δk&eth; &THORN;x� ω&thorn; Δω&eth; &THORN;t&frac12; � &eth;4:8&THORN;

</p>
<p>E1 and E2 differ in frequency by 2Δω. Since each wave must have the phase
</p>
<p>velocity ω/k appropriate to the medium in which they propagate, one must allow
</p>
<p>for a difference 2Δk in propagation constant. Using the abbreviations

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This is a sinusoidally modulated wave (Fig. 4.1). The envelope of the wave, given
</p>
<p>by cos [(Δk)x� (Δω)t], is what carries information; it travels at velocity Δω/Δk.
Taking the limit Δω! 0, we define the group velocity to be
</p>
<p>vg &frac14; dω=dk &eth;4:10&THORN;
</p>
<p>It is this quantity that cannot exceed c.
</p>
<p>4.3 Plasma Oscillations
</p>
<p>If the electrons in a plasma are displaced from a uniform background of ions,
</p>
<p>electric fields will be built up in such a direction as to restore the neutrality of the
</p>
<p>plasma by pulling the electrons back to their original positions. Because of their
</p>
<p>inertia, the electrons will overshoot and oscillate around their equilibrium positions
</p>
<p>with a characteristic frequency known as the plasma frequency. This oscillation is
</p>
<p>so fast that the massive ions do not have time to respond to the oscillating field and
</p>
<p>may be considered as fixed. In Fig. 4.2, the open rectangles represent typical
</p>
<p>elements of the ion fluid, and the darkened rectangles the alternately displaced
</p>
<p>elements of the electron fluid. The resulting charge bunching causes a spatially
</p>
<p>periodic E field, which tends to restore the electrons to their neutral positions.
We shall derive an expression for the plasma frequency ωp in the simplest case,
</p>
<p>making the following assumptions: (1) There is no magnetic field; (2) there are no
</p>
<p>thermal motions (KT&frac14; 0); (3) the ions are fixed in space in a uniform distribution;
(4) the plasma is infinite in extent; and (5) the electron motions occur only in the
</p>
<p>x direction. As a consequence of the last assumption, we have
</p>
<p>&nabla; &frac14; x̂&part;=&part;x E &frac14; Ex̂ &nabla; � E &frac14; 0 E &frac14; �&nabla;ϕ &eth;4:11&THORN;

<p>The only Maxwell equation we shall need is the one that does not involve B:
Poisson&rsquo;s equation. This case is an exception to the general rule of Sect. 3.6 that
</p>
<p>Poisson&rsquo;s equation cannot be used to find E. This is a high-frequency oscillation;
electron inertia is important, and the deviation from neutrality is the main effect in
</p>
<p>this particular case. Consequently, we write
</p>
<p>ε0&nabla; � E &frac14; ε0&part;E=&part;x &frac14; e ni � ne&eth; &THORN; &eth;4:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>Equations (4.12)&ndash;(4.14) can easily be solved by the procedure of linearization.
</p>
<p>By this we mean that the amplitude of oscillation is small, and terms containing
</p>
<p>higher powers of amplitude factors can be neglected. We first separate the depen-
</p>
<p>dent variables into two parts: an &ldquo;equilibrium&rdquo; part indicated by a subscript 0, and a
</p>
<p>&ldquo;perturbation&rdquo; part indicated by a subscript 1:

</p>
<p>The equilibrium quantities express the state of the plasma in the absence of the
</p>
<p>oscillation. Since we have assumed a uniform neutral plasma at rest before the
</p>
<p>electrons are displaced, we have

<p>This frequency, depending only on the plasma density, is one of the fundamental
</p>
<p>parameters of a plasma. Because of the smallness of m, the plasma frequency is
</p>
<p>usually very high. For instance, in a plasma of density n&frac14; 1018 m�3, we have
</p>
<p>fp � 9 1018

<p>Radiation at fp normally lies in the microwave range. We can compare this with
</p>
<p>another electron frequency: ωc. A useful numerical formula is
</p>
<p>fce &rsquo; 28GHz=Tesla &eth;4:27&THORN;
</p>
<p>Thus if B� 0.32 T and n� 1018 m�3, the cyclotron frequency is approximately
equal to the plasma frequency for electrons.
</p>
<p>Equation (4.25) tells us that if a plasma oscillation is to occur at all, it must have a
</p>
<p>frequency depending only on n. In particular, ω does not depend on k, so the group
</p>
<p>velocity dω/dk is zero. The disturbance does not propagate. How this can happen can
</p>
<p>bemade clear with amechanical analogy (Fig. 4.3). Imagine a number of heavy balls
</p>
<p>suspended by springs equally spaced in a line. If all the springs are identical, each
</p>
<p>ball will oscillate vertically with the same frequency. If the balls are started in the
</p>
<p>proper phases relative to one another, they can be made to form a wave propagating
</p>
<p>in either direction. The frequency will be fixed by the springs, but the wavelength
</p>
<p>can be chosen arbitrarily. The two undisturbed balls at the ends will not be affected,
</p>
<p>and the initial disturbance does not propagate. Either traveling waves or standing
</p>
<p>waves can be created, as in the case of a stretched rope. Waves on a rope, however,
</p>
<p>must propagate because each segment is connected to neighboring segments.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This analogy is not quite accurate, because plasma oscillations have motions in
</p>
<p>the direction of k rather than transverse to k. However, as long as electrons do not
collide with ions or with each other, they can still be pictured as independent
</p>
<p>oscillators moving horizontally (in Fig. 4.3). But what about the electric field?
</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t that extend past the region of initial disturbance and set neighboring layers of
</p>
<p>plasma into oscillation? In our simple example, it will not, because the electric field
</p>
<p>due to equal numbers of positive and negative infinite plane charge sheets is zero. In
</p>
<p>any finite system, however, plasma oscillations will propagate. In Fig. 4.4, the
</p>
<p>positive and negative (shaded) regions of a plane plasma oscillation are confined in
</p>
<p>a cylindrical tube. The fringing electric field causes a coupling of the disturbance to
</p>
<p>adjacent layers, and the oscillation does not stay localized.

</p>
<p>There is another effect that can cause plasma oscillations to propagate, and that is
</p>
<p>thermal motion. Electrons streaming into adjacent layers of plasma with their
</p>
<p>thermal velocities will carry information about what is happening in the oscillating
</p>
<p>region. The plasma oscillation can then properly be called a plasma wave. We can
</p>
<p>easily treat this effect by adding a term �&nabla;pe to the equation of motion Eq. (4.12).
In the one-dimensional problem, γ will be three, according to Eq. (3.53). Hence,

<p>The slope of the curve at P gives the group velocity. This is clearly always less than

<p>(3/2)1/2 vth, which, in our nonrelativistic theory, is much less than c. Note that at
</p>
<p>large k (small λ), information travels essentially at the thermal velocity. At small
</p>
<p>k (large λ), information travels more slowly than vth even though vϕ is greater than
</p>
<p>vth. This is because the density gradient is small at large λ, and thermal motions
</p>
<p>carry very little net momentum into adjacent layers.
</p>
<p>The existence of plasma oscillations has been known since the days of Langmuir
</p>
<p>in the 1920s. It was not until 1949 that Bohm and Gross worked out a detailed
</p>
<p>theory telling how the waves would propagate and how they could be excited.
</p>
<p>A simple way to excite plasma waves would be to apply an oscillating potential to a
</p>
<p>grid or a series of grids in a plasma; however, oscillators in the GHz range were not
</p>
<p>generally available in those days. Instead, one had to use an electron beam to excite
</p>
<p>plasma waves. If the electrons in the beam were bunched so that they passed by any
</p>
<p>fixed point at a frequency fp, they would generate an electric field at that frequency
</p>
<p>and excite plasma oscillations. It is not necessary to form the electron bunches
</p>
<p>beforehand; once the plasma oscillations arise, they will bunch the electrons, and
</p>
<p>the oscillations will grow by a positive feedback mechanism. An experiment to test
</p>
<p>this theory was first performed by Looney and Brown in 1954. Their apparatus was
</p>
<p>entirely contained in a glass bulb about 10 cm in diameter (Fig. 4.6). A plasma
</p>
<p>filling the bulb was formed by an electrical discharge between the cathodes K and
</p>
<p>an anode ring A under a low pressure (3� 10�3 Torr) of mercury vapor. An electron
beam was created in a side arm containing a negatively biased filament. The emitted
</p>
<p>electrons were accelerated to 200 V and shot into the plasma through a small hole.
</p>
<p>A thin, movable probe wire connected to a radio receiver was used to pick up the
</p>
<p>oscillations. Figure 4.7 shows their experimental results for f2 vs. discharge current,
</p>
<p>which is generally proportional to density. The points show a linear dependence, in
</p>
<p>rough agreement with Eq. (4.26). Deviations from the straight line could be
</p>
<p>attributed to the k2v2th term in Eq. (4.30). However, not all frequencies were
</p>
<p>observed; k had to be such that an integral number of half wavelengths fit along

<p>the plasma column. The standing wave patterns are shown at the left of Fig. 4.7. The
</p>
<p>predicted traveling plasma waves could not be seen in this experiment, probably
</p>
<p>because the beam was so thin that thermal motions carried electrons out of the
</p>
<p>beam, thus dissipating the oscillation energy. The electron bunching was accom-
</p>
<p>plished not in the plasma but in the oscillating sheaths at the ends of the plasma
</p>
<p>column. In this early experiment, one learned that reproducing the conditions
</p>
<p>assumed in the uniform plasma theory requires considerable skill.

<p>technique, we show the results of Barrett, Jones, and Franklin. Figure 4.8 is a
</p>
<p>schematic of their apparatus. The cylindrical column of quiescent plasma is pro-
</p>
<p>duced in a Q-machine by thermal ionization of Cs atoms on hot tungsten plates (not
</p>
<p>shown). A strong magnetic field restricts electrons to motions along the column.
</p>
<p>The waves are excited by a wire probe driven by an oscillator and are detected by a
</p>
<p>second, movable probe. A metal shield surrounding the plasma prevents commu-
</p>
<p>nication between the probes by ordinary microwave (electromagnetic wave) prop-
</p>
<p>agation, since the shield constitutes a waveguide beyond cutoff for the frequency
</p>
<p>used. The traveling waveforms are traced by interferometry: the transmitted and
</p>
<p>received signals are detected by a crystal which gives a large dc output when the
</p>
<p>signals are in phase and zero output when they are 90� out of phase. The resulting
signal is shown in Fig. 4.9 as a function of position along the column. Synchronous
</p>
<p>detection is used to suppress the noise level. The excitation signal is chopped at
</p>
<p>500 kHz, and the received signal should also be modulated at 500 kHz. By detecting
</p>
<p>only the 500-kHz component of the received signal, noise at other frequencies is
</p>
<p>eliminated. The traces of Fig. 4.9 give a measurement of k. When the oscillator
</p>
<p>frequency ω is varied, a plot of the dispersion curve (ω/ωp)
2 vs. ka is obtained,
</p>
<p>where a is the radius of the column (Fig. 4.10). The various curves are labeled
</p>
<p>according to the value of ωpa/vth. For vth&frac14; 0, we have the curve labeled 1, which
corresponds to the dispersion relation ω&frac14;ωp. For finite vth, the curves correspond

<p>to that of Fig. 4.5. There is good agreement between the experimental points and the
</p>
<p>theoretical curves. The decrease of ω at small ka is the finite-geometry effect shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 4.4. In this particular experiment, that effect can be explained another way.
</p>
<p>To satisfy the boundary condition imposed by the conducting shield, namely that
</p>
<p>E&frac14; 0 on the conductor, the plasma waves must travel at an angle to the magnetic
field. Destructive interference between waves traveling with an outward radial
</p>
<p>component of k and those traveling inward enables the boundary condition to be
</p>
<p>satisfied. However, waves traveling at an angle to B have crests and troughs
separated by a distance larger than λ/2 (Fig. 4.11). Since the electrons can move
</p>
<p>only along B (if B is very large), they are subject to less acceleration, and the
frequency is lowered below ωp.

<p>This is the dispersion relation for ion acoustic waves; υs is the sound speed in a
</p>
<p>plasma. Since the ions suffer one-dimensional compressions in the plane waves we
</p>
<p>have assumed, we may set γi&frac14; 3 here. The electrons move so fast relative to these
waves that they have time to equalize their temperature everywhere; therefore, the
</p>
<p>electrons are isothermal, and γe&frac14; 1. Otherwise, a factor γe would appear in front of
KTe in Eq. (4.41).
</p>
<p>The dispersion curve for ion waves (Fig. 4.12) has a fundamentally different
</p>
<p>character from that for electron waves (Fig. 4.5). Plasma oscillations are basically
</p>
<p>constant-frequency waves, with a correction due to thermal motions. Ion waves are
</p>
<p>basically constant-velocity waves and exist only when there are thermal motions.
</p>
<p>For ion waves, the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity. The reasons for this
</p>
<p>difference can be seen from the following description of the physical mechanisms
</p>
<p>involved. In electron plasma oscillations, the other species (namely, ions) remains
</p>
<p>essentially fixed. In ion acoustic waves, the other species (namely, electrons) is far
</p>
<p>from fixed; in fact, electrons are pulled along with the ions and tend to shield out
</p>
<p>electric fields arising from the bunching of ions. However, this shielding is not
</p>
<p>perfect because, as we saw in Sect. 1.4, potentials of the order of KTe/e can leak out
</p>
<p>because of electron thermal motions. What happens is as follows. The ions form
</p>
<p>regions of compression and rarefaction, just as in an ordinary sound wave. The
</p>
<p>compressed regions tend to expand into the rarefactions, for two reasons. First, the
</p>
<p>ion thermal motions spread out the ions; this effect gives rise to the second term in
</p>
<p>the square root of Eq. (4.41). Second, the ion bunches are positively charged and
</p>
<p>tend to disperse because of the resulting electric field. This field is largely shielded
</p>
<p>out by electrons, and only a fraction, proportional to KTe, is available to act on the
</p>
<p>ion bunches. This effect gives rise to the first term in the square root of Eq. (4.41).
</p>
<p>The ions overshoot because of their inertia, and the compressions and rarefactions
</p>
<p>are regenerated to form a wave.
</p>
<p>The second effect mentioned above leads to a curious phenomenon. When KTi
goes to zero, ion waves still exist. This does not happen in a neutral gas (Eq. (4.36)).
</p>
<p>The acoustic velocity is then given by

</p>
<p>This is often observed in laboratory plasmas, in which the condition Ti	 Te is a
common occurrence. The sound speed υs depends on electron temperature (because
</p>
<p>the electric field is proportional to it) and on ion mass (because the fluid&rsquo;s inertia is
</p>
<p>proportional to it).
</p>
<p>4.7 Validity of the Plasma Approximation
</p>
<p>In deriving the velocity of ion waves, we used the neutrality condition ni&frac14; ne while
allowing E to be finite. To see what error was engendered in the process, we now
allow ni to differ from ne and use the linearized Poisson equation:

� Ω2p &eth;4:49&THORN;
</p>
<p>We have, for simplicity, also taken the limit Ti! 0. Here Ωp is the ion plasma
frequency. For high frequencies (short wavelengths) the ion acoustic wave turns into
</p>
<p>a constant-frequency wave. There is thus a complementary behavior between elec-
</p>
<p>tron plasma waves and ion acoustic waves: the former are basically constant fre-
</p>
<p>quency, but become constant velocity at large k; the latter are basically constant
</p>
<p>velocity, but become constant frequency at large k. This comparison is shown
</p>
<p>graphically in Fig. 4.13.
</p>
<p>Experimental verification of the existence of ion waves was first accomplished
</p>
<p>by Wong, Motley, and D&rsquo;Angelo. Figure 4.14 shows their apparatus, which was
</p>
<p>again a Q-machine. (It is no accident that we have referred to Q-machines so often;
</p>
<p>careful experimental checks of plasma theory were possible only after schemes to
</p>
<p>make quiescent plasmas were discovered.) Waves were launched and detected by
</p>
<p>grids inserted into the plasma. Figure 4.15 shows oscilloscope traces of the
</p>
<p>transmitted and received signals. From the phase shift, one can find the phase
</p>
<p>velocity (same as group velocity in this case). These phase shifts are plotted as

<p>4.9 Electrostatic Electron Oscillations Perpendicular to B
</p>
<p>Up to now, we have assumed B&frac14; 0. When a magnetic field exists, many more types
of waves are possible. We shall examine only the simplest cases, starting with high-
</p>
<p>frequency, electrostatic, electron oscillations propagating at right angles to the
</p>
<p>magnetic field. First, we should define the terms perpendicular, parallel, longitudi-
</p>
<p>nal, transverse, electrostatic, and electromagnetic. Parallel and perpendicular will
</p>
<p>be used to denote the direction of k relative to the undisturbed magnetic field B0.
Longitudinal and transverse refer to the direction of k relative to the oscillating
electric field E1. If the oscillating magnetic field B1 is zero, the wave is electro-
static; otherwise, it is electromagnetic. The last two sets of terms are related by
</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s equation
</p>
<p>&nabla; � E1 &frac14; � _B1 &eth;4:50&THORN;
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>k� E1 &frac14; ωB1 &eth;4:51&THORN;
</p>
<p>If a wave is longitudinal, k�E1 vanishes, and the wave is also electrostatic. If the
wave is transverse, B1 is finite, and the wave is electromagnetic. It is of course
possible for k to be at an arbitrary angle to B0 or E1; then one would have a mixture
of the principal modes presented here.
</p>
<p>Coming back to the electron oscillations perpendicular to B0, we shall assume
that the ions are too massive to move at the frequencies involved and form a fixed,
</p>
<p>uniform background of positive charge. We shall also neglect thermal motions and
</p>
<p>set KTe&frac14; 0. The equilibrium plasma, as usual, has constant and uniform n0 and B0
and zero E0 and v0. The motion of electrons is then governed by the following
linearized equations:
</p>
<p>m
&part;ve1
&part;t
</p>
<p>&frac14; �e E1 &thorn; ve1 � B0&eth; &THORN; &eth;4:52&THORN;

</p>
<p>ε0&nabla; � E1 &frac14; �ene1 &eth;4:54&THORN;
</p>
<p>We shall consider only longitudinal waves with k║E1. Without loss of generality,
we can choose the x axis to lie along k and E1, and the z axis to lie along B0
(Fig. 4.18). Thus ky&frac14; kz&frac14;Ey&frac14;Ez&frac14; 0, k &frac14; kx̂ , and E &frac14; Ex̂ : Dropping the sub-
scripts 1 and e and separating Eq. (4.52) into components, we have

<p>Note that υx becomes infinite at cyclotron resonance, ω&frac14;ωc. This is to be expected,
since the electric field changes sign with υ x and continuously accelerates the
</p>
<p>electrons. [Note that the fluid and single-particle equations are identical when the
</p>
<p>(v &middot; &nabla;)v and &nabla;p terms are both neglected, so that all the particles move together.]

<p>4.9 Electrostatic Electron Oscillations Perpendicular to B 97</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The frequency ωh is called the upper hybrid frequency. Electrostatic electron waves
</p>
<p>across B have this frequency, while those along B are the usual plasma oscillations
with ω&frac14;ωp. The group velocity is again zero as long as thermal motions are
neglected.
</p>
<p>A physical picture of this oscillation is given in Fig. 4.19. Electrons in the plane
</p>
<p>wave form regions of compression and rarefaction, as in a plasma oscillation.
</p>
<p>However, there is now a B field perpendicular to the motion, and the Lorentz
force turns the trajectories into ellipses. There are two restoring forces acting on
</p>
<p>the electrons: the electrostatic field and the Lorentz force. The increased restoring
</p>
<p>force makes the frequency larger than that of a plasma oscillation. As the magnetic
</p>
<p>field goes to zero, ωc goes to zero in Eq. (4.60), and one recovers a plasma
</p>
<p>oscillation. As the plasma density goes to zero, ωp goes to zero, and one has a
</p>
<p>simple Larmor gyration, since the electrostatic forces vanish with density.
</p>
<p>The existence of the upper hybrid frequency has been verified experimentally by
</p>
<p>microwave transmission across a magnetic field. As the plasma density is varied,
</p>
<p>the transmission through the plasma takes a dip at the density that makes ωh equal to
</p>
<p>the applied frequency. This is because the upper hybrid oscillations are excited, and
</p>
<p>energy is absorbed from the beam. From Eq. (4.60), we find a linear relationship
</p>
<p>between ω2c /ω
2 and the density:
</p>
<p>ω2c

</p>
<p>This linear relation is followed by the experimental points on Fig. 4.20, where
</p>
<p>ω2c /ω
2 is plotted against the discharge current, which is proportional to n.
</p>
<p>If we now consider propagation at an angle θ to B, we will get two possible
waves. One is like the plasma oscillation, and the other is like the upper hybrid
</p>
<p>oscillation, but both will be modified by the angle of propagation. The details of this

<p>are left as an exercise (Problem 4.8). Figure 4.21 shows schematically the ω&ndash;kz
diagram for these two waves for fixed kx, where kx/kz&frac14; tan θ. Because of the
symmetry of Eq. (4.60), the case ωc&gt;ωp is the same as the case ωp&gt;ωc with the
subscripts interchanged. For large kz, the wave travels parallel to B0. One wave is
the plasma oscillation at ω&frac14;ωp; the other wave, at ω&frac14;ωc, is a spurious root at
kz!1. For small kz, we have the situation of k&perp; B0 discussed in this section. The
lower branch vanishes, while the upper branch approaches the hybrid oscillation at
</p>
<p>ω&frac14;ωh. These curves were first calculated by Trivelpiece and Gould, who also
verified them experimentally (Fig. 4.22). The Trivelpiece&ndash;Gould experiment was
</p>
<p>done in a cylindrical plasma column; it can be shown that varying kz in this case is
</p>
<p>equivalent to propagating plane waves at various angles to B0.

</p>
<p>4.10 Electrostatic Ion Waves Perpendicular to B
</p>
<p>We next consider what happens to the ion acoustic wave when k is perpendicular to
B0. It is tempting to set k &middot;B0 exactly equal to zero, but this would lead to a result
(Sect. 4.11) which, though mathematically correct, does not describe what usually
</p>
<p>happens in real plasmas. Instead, we shall let k be almost perpendicular to B0; what
we mean by &ldquo;almost&rdquo; will be made clear later. We shall assume the usual infinite
</p>
<p>plasma in equilibrium, with n0 and B0 constant and uniform and v0&frac14;E0&frac14; 0. For
simplicity, we shall take Ti&frac14; 0; we shall not miss any important effects because we
know that acoustic waves still exist if Ti&frac14; 0. We also assume electrostatic waves
with k�E&frac14; 0, so that E&frac14;�&nabla;ϕ. The geometry is shown in Fig. 4.23. The angle
&frac12;π� θ is taken to be so small that we may take E &frac14; E1x̂ and&nabla; &frac14; ikx̂ as far as the
ion motion is concerned. For the electrons, however, it makes a great deal of
</p>
<p>difference whether &frac12;π� θ is zero, or small but finite. The electrons have such
small Larmor radii that they cannot move in the x direction to preserve charge
</p>
<p>neutrality; all that the E field does is make them drift back and forth in the
y direction. If θ is not exactly π/2, however, the electrons can move along the
</p>
<p>dashed line (along B0) in Fig. 4.23 to carry charge from negative to positive regions
in the wave and carry out Debye shielding. The ions cannot do this effectively
</p>
<p>because their inertia prevents them from moving such long distances in a wave
</p>
<p>period; this is why we can neglect kz for ions. The critical angle χ&frac14;&frac12;π� θ is
proportional to the ratio of ion to electron parallel velocities: χ&rsquo; (m/M )1/2

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The physical explanation of these waves is very similar to that in Fig. 4.19 for
</p>
<p>upper hybrid waves. The ions undergo an acoustic-type oscillation, but the Lorentz
</p>
<p>force constitutes a new restoring force giving rise to the Ω2c term in Eq. (4.67). The
</p>
<p>acoustic dispersion relation ω2 &frac14; k2v2s is valid if the electrons provide Debye
shielding. In this case, they do so by flowing long distances along B0.
</p>
<p>Electrostatic ion cyclotron waves were first observed by Motley and D&rsquo;Angelo,
</p>
<p>again in aQ-machine (Fig. 4.24). The waves propagated radially outward across the
</p>
<p>magnetic field and were excited by a current drawn along the axis to a small
</p>
<p>auxiliary electrode. The reason for excitation is rather complicated and will not
</p>
<p>be given here. Figure 4.25 gives their results for the wave frequency vs. magnetic
</p>
<p>field. In this experiment, the k2v2s term was small compared to the Ω
2
c term, and the
</p>
<p>measured frequencies lay only slightly above Ωc.
</p>
<p>4.11 The Lower Hybrid Frequency

<p>We now consider what happens when θ is exactly π/2, and the electrons are not
</p>
<p>allowed to preserve charge neutrality by flowing along the lines of force. Instead of
</p>
<p>obeying Boltzmann&rsquo;s relation, they will obey the full equation of motion,

<p>4.12 Electromagnetic Waves with B0&frac14; 0
</p>
<p>Next in the order of complexity come waves with B1 6&frac14; 0. These are transverse
electromagnetic waves&mdash;light waves or radio waves traveling through a plasma.
</p>
<p>We begin with a brief review of light waves in a vacuum. The relevant Maxwell
</p>
<p>equations are
</p>
<p>&nabla; � E1 &frac14; � _B1 &eth;4:72&THORN;
</p>
<p>c2&nabla; � B1 &frac14; _E1 &eth;4:73&THORN;
</p>
<p>since in a vacuum j&frac14; 0 and ε0μ0&frac14; c�2. Taking the curl of Eq. (4.73) and substitut-
ing into the time derivative of Eq. (4.72), we have
</p>
<p>c2&nabla; � &nabla; � B1&eth; &THORN; &frac14; &nabla; � _E1 &frac14; �&euro;B1 &eth;4:74&THORN;
</p>
<p>Again assuming planes waves varying as exp [i(kx�ωt)], we have
</p>
<p>ω2B1 &frac14; �c2k� k� B1&eth; &THORN; &frac14; �c2 k k � B1&eth; &THORN; � k2B1
	 

</p>
<p>&eth;4:75&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since k &middot;B1&frac14;�i&nabla; &middot; B1&frac14; 0 by another of Maxwell&rsquo;s equations, the result is
</p>
<p>ω2 &frac14; k2c2 &eth;4:76&THORN;
</p>
<p>and c is the phase velocity ω/k of light waves.
</p>
<p>In a plasma with B0&frac14; 0, Eq. (4.72) is unchanged, but we must add a term j1/E0 to
Eq. (4.73) to account for currents due to first-order charged particle motions:
</p>
<p>c2&nabla; � B1 &frac14;
j1
ε0
</p>
<p>&thorn; _E1 &eth;4:77&THORN;
</p>
<p>The time derivative of this is
</p>
<p>c2&nabla; � _B1 &frac14;
1
</p>
<p>ε0
</p>
<p>&part; j1
&part;t
</p>
<p>&thorn; &euro;E1 &eth;4:78&THORN;
</p>
<p>while the curl of Eq. (4.72) is
</p>
<p>&nabla; � &nabla; � E1&eth; &THORN; &frac14; &nabla; &nabla; � E1&eth; &THORN; �&nabla;2E1 &frac14; �&nabla; � _B1 &eth;4:79&THORN;
</p>
<p>Eliminating &nabla; � _B1 and assuming an exp [i(k &middot; r�ωt)] dependence, we have
</p>
<p>�k k � E1&eth; &THORN; &thorn; k2E1 &frac14;

</p>
<p>If we consider light waves or microwaves, these will be of such high frequency that

<p>the ions can be considered as fixed. The current j1 then comes entirely from electron
motion:
</p>
<p>j1 &frac14; �n0eve1 &eth;4:82&THORN;

</p>
<p>The expression for ω2p is recognizable on the right-hand side, and the result is
</p>
<p>ω2 &frac14; ω2p &thorn; c2k2 &eth;4:85&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves propagating in a plasma
</p>
<p>with no dc magnetic field. We see that the vacuum relation Eq. (4.76) is modified by
</p>
<p>a term ω2p reminiscent of plasma oscillations. The phase velocity of a light wave in a
</p>
<p>plasma is greater than the velocity of light:

<p>k2
&frac14; c2 &thorn;
</p>
<p>ω2p
</p>
<p>k2
&gt; c2 &eth;4:86&THORN;
</p>
<p>However, the group velocity cannot exceed the velocity of light. From Eq. (4.85),
</p>
<p>we find
</p>

<p>dk
&frac14; vg &frac14;
</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>vϕ
&eth;4:87&THORN;
</p>
<p>so that vg is less than c whenever vϕ is greater than c. The dispersion relation
</p>
<p>Eq. (4.85) is shown in Fig. 4.26. This diagram resembles that of Fig. 4.5 for plasma
</p>
<p>waves, but the dispersion relation is really quite different because the asymptotic
</p>
<p>velocity c in Fig. 4.26 is so much larger than the thermal velocity vth in Fig. 4.5.
</p>
<p>4.12 Electromagnetic Waves with B0&frac14; 0 107</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>More importantly, there is a difference in damping of the waves. Plasma waves with
</p>
<p>large kvth are highly damped, a result we shall obtain from kinetic theory in Chap. 7.
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic waves, on the other hand, become ordinary light waves at large kc
</p>
<p>and are not damped by the presence of the plasma in this limit.
</p>
<p>A dispersion relation like Eq. (4.85) exhibits a phenomenon called cutoff. If one
</p>
<p>sends a microwave beam with a given frequency ω through a plasma, the wave-
</p>
<p>length 2π/k in the plasma will take on the value prescribed by Eq. (4.85). As the
</p>
<p>plasma density, and hence ω2p is raised, k
2 will necessarily decrease; and the
</p>
<p>wavelength becomes longer and longer. Finally, a density will be reached such
</p>
<p>that k2 is zero. For densities larger than this, Eq. (4.85) cannot be satisfied for any
</p>
<p>real k, and the wave cannot propagate. This cutoff condition occurs at a critical
</p>
<p>density nc such that ω&frac14;ωp; namely (from Eq. (4.25))
</p>
<p>nc &frac14; mε0ω2=e2 &eth;4:88&THORN;
</p>
<p>If n is too large or ω too small, an electromagnetic wave cannot pass through a
</p>
<p>plasma. When this happens, Eq. (4.85) tells us that k is imaginary:
</p>
<p>ck &frac14; ω2 � ω2p
� �1=2
</p>
<p>&frac14; i
&#13;&#13;ω2p � ω2
</p>
<p>&#13;&#13;1=2 &eth;4:89&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since the wave has a spatial dependence exp(ikx), it will be exponentially attenu-
</p>
<p>ated if k is imaginary. The skin depth δ is found as follows:
</p>
<p>eikx &frac14; e�jkjx &frac14; e�x=δ δ &frac14; jkj�1 &frac14; c
</p>
<p>ω2p � ω2
� �1=2 &eth;4:90&THORN;
</p>
<p>For most laboratory plasmas, the cutoff frequency lies in the microwave range.

<p>4.13 Experimental Applications
</p>
<p>The phenomenon of cutoff suggests an easy way to measure plasma density. A
</p>
<p>beam of microwaves generated by a klystron is launched toward the plasma by a
</p>
<p>horn antenna (Fig. 4.27). The transmitted beam is collected by another horn and is
</p>
<p>detected by a crystal. As the frequency or the plasma density is varied, the detected
</p>
<p>signal will disappear whenever the condition Eq. (4.88) is satisfied somewhere in
</p>
<p>the plasma. This procedure gives the maximum density. It is not a convenient or
</p>
<p>versatile scheme because the range of frequencies generated by a single microwave
</p>
<p>generator is limited.
</p>
<p>A widely used method of density measurement relies on the dispersion, or
</p>
<p>variation of index of refraction, predicted by Eq. (4.85). The index of refraction ~n
</p>
<p>is defined as
</p>
<p>en � c=vϕ &frac14; ck=ω &eth;4:91&THORN;
</p>
<p>This clearly varies with ω, and a plasma is a dispersive medium. A microwave
</p>
<p>interferometer employing the same physical principles as the Michelson interfer-
</p>
<p>ometer is used to measure density (Fig. 4.28). The signal from a klystron is split into
</p>

<p>two paths. Part of the signal goes to the detector through the &ldquo;reference leg.&rdquo; The
</p>
<p>other part is sent through the plasma with horn antennas. The detector responds to
</p>
<p>the mean square of the sum of the amplitudes of the two received signals. These
</p>
<p>signals are adjusted to be equal in amplitude and 180� out of phase in the absence of
plasma by the attenuator and phase shifter, so that the detector output is zero. When
</p>
<p>the plasma is turned on, the phase of the signal in the plasma leg is changed as the
</p>
<p>wavelength increases (Fig. 4.29). The detector then gives a finite output signal. As
</p>
<p>the density increases, the detector output goes through a maximum and a minimum
</p>
<p>every time the phase shift changes by 360�. The average density in the plasma is
found from the number of such fringe shifts. Actually, one usually uses a high
</p>
<p>enough frequency that the fringe shift is kept small. Then the density is linearly
</p>
<p>proportional to the fringe shift (Problem 4.13). The sensitivity of this technique at
</p>
<p>low densities is limited to the stability of the reference leg against vibrations and
</p>
<p>thermal expansion. Corrections must also be made for attenuation due to collisions
</p>
<p>and for diffraction and refraction by the finite-sized plasma.
</p>
<p>The fact that the index of refraction is less than unity for a plasma has some
</p>
<p>interesting consequences. A convex plasma lens (Fig. 4.30) is divergent rather
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.29 The observed signal from an interferometer (right) as plasma density is increased, and

<p>than convergent. This effect is important in the laser-solenoid proposal for a linear
</p>
<p>fusion reactor. A plasma hundreds of meters long is confined by a strong magnetic
</p>
<p>field and heated by absorption of CO2 laser radiation (Fig. 4.31). If the plasma has a
</p>
<p>normal density profile (maximum on the axis), it behaves like a negative lens and
</p>
<p>causes the laser beam to diverge into the walls. If an inverted density profile
</p>
<p>(minimum on the axis) can be created, however, the lens effect becomes converg-
</p>
<p>ing; and the radiation is focused and trapped by the plasma. The inverted profile can
</p>
<p>be produced by squeezing the plasma with a pulsed coil surrounding it, or it can be
</p>
<p>produced by the laser beam itself. As the beam heats the plasma, the latter expands,
</p>
<p>decreasing the density at the center of the beam. The CO2 laser operates at
</p>

</p>
<p>However, because of the long path lengths involved, the refraction effects are
</p>
<p>important even at densities of 1022 m�3. The focusing effect of a hollow plasma
has been shown experimentally.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the best known effect of the plasma cutoff is the application to short-
</p>
<p>wave radio communication. When a radio wave reaches an altitude in the iono-
</p>
<p>sphere where the plasma density is sufficiently high, the wave is reflected
</p>
<p>(Fig. 4.32), making it possible to send signals around the earth. If we take the
</p>
<p>maximum density to be 1012 m�3, the critical frequency is of the order of 10 MHz
(cf. Eq. (4.26)). To communicate with space vehicles, it is necessary to use
</p>
<p>frequencies above this in order to penetrate the ionosphere. However, during
</p>
<p>reentry of a space vehicle, a plasma is generated by the intense heat of friction.
</p>
<p>This causes a plasma cutoff, resulting in a communications blackout during reentry
</p>
<p>(Fig. 4.32).

<p>4.14 Electromagnetic Waves Perpendicular to B0
</p>
<p>We now consider the propagation of electromagnetic waves when a magnetic field
</p>
<p>is present. We treat first the case of perpendicular propagation, k &perp; B0. If we take
transverse waves, with k &perp; E1, there are still two choices: E1 can be parallel to B0
or perpendicular to B0 (Fig. 4.33).
</p>
<p>4.14.1 Ordinary Wave, E1 ║ B0
</p>
<p>If E1 is parallel to B0, we may take B0 &frac14; B0ẑ , E1 &frac14; E1ẑ , k &frac14; kx̂ : In a real
experiment, this geometry is approximated by a beam of microwaves incident on
</p>
<p>a plasma column with the narrow dimension of the waveguide in line with B0
(Fig. 4.34).

motion
</p>
<p>m&part;vez=&part;t &frac14; �eEz &eth;4:93&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since this is the same as the equation for B0&frac14; 0, the result is the same as we had
previously for B0&frac14; 0:
</p>
<p>ω2 &frac14; ω2p &thorn; c2k2 &eth;4:94&THORN;
</p>
<p>This wave, with E1 ║ B0, is called the ordinary wave. The terminology &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo;
and &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; is taken from crystal optics; however, the terms have been
</p>
<p>interchanged. In plasma physics, it makes more sense to let the &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; wave be
</p>
<p>the one that is not affected by the magnetic field. Strict analogy with crystal optics
</p>
<p>would have required calling this the &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; wave.

<p>4.14.2 Extraordinary Wave, E1 &perp; B0
</p>
<p>If E1 is perpendicular to B0, the electron motion will be affected by B0, and the
dispersion relation will be changed. To treat this case, one would be tempted to take
</p>
<p>E1 &frac14; E1 ŷ and k &frac14; kx̂ (Fig. 4.33). However, it turns out that waves with E1 &perp; B0
tend to be elliptically polarized instead of plane polarized. That is, as such a wave
</p>
<p>propagates into a plasma, it develops a component Ex along k, thus becoming partly
longitudinal and partly transverse. To treat this mode properly, we must allow E1 to
have both x and y components (Fig. 4.35):

<p>This is the dispersion relation for the extraordinary wave. It is an electromagnetic
</p>
<p>wave, partly transverse and partly longitudinal, which propagates perpendicular to
</p>
<p>B0 with E1 perpendicular to B0.
</p>
<p>4.15 Cutoffs and Resonances
</p>
<p>The dispersion relation for the extraordinary wave is considerably more compli-
</p>
<p>cated than any we have met up to now. To analyze what it means, it is useful to
</p>
<p>define the terms cutoff and resonance. A cutoff occurs in a plasma when the index of
</p>
<p>refraction goes to zero; that is, when the wavelength becomes infinite, since ~n&frac14; ck/
ω. A resonance occurs when the index of refraction becomes infinite; that is, when
</p>
<p>the wavelength becomes zero. As a wave propagates through a region in which ωp
and ωc are changing, it may encounter cutoffs and resonances. A wave is generally
</p>
<p>reflected at a cutoff and absorbed at a resonance.
</p>
<p>The resonance of the extraordinary wave is found by setting k equal to infinity in
</p>
<p>Eq. (4.104). For any finite ω, k!1 implies ω!ωh, so that a resonance occurs at a
point in the plasma where
</p>
<p>ω2h &frac14; ω2p &thorn; ω2c &frac14; ω2 &eth;4:105&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is easily recognized as the dispersion relation for electrostatic waves propa-
</p>
<p>gating across B0 (Eq. (4.60)). As a wave of given ω approaches the resonance point,
both its phase velocity and its group velocity approach zero, and the wave energy is
</p>
<p>converted into upper hybrid oscillations. The extraordinary wave is partly electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic and partly electrostatic; it can easily be shown (Problem 4.14) that at
</p>
<p>resonance this wave loses its electromagnetic character and becomes an electro-
</p>
<p>static oscillation.

<p>The cutoffs of the extraordinary wave are found by setting k equal to zero in
</p>
<p>Eq. (4.104). Dividing by ω2 � ω2p; we can write the resulting equation for ω as

<p>Each of the two signs will give a different cutoff frequency; we shall call these ωR
and ωL. The roots of the two quadratics are

�ωc &thorn; ω2c &thorn; 4ω2p
</p>
<p>� �1=2� � &eth;4:108&THORN;
</p>
<p>We have taken the plus sign in front of the square root in each case because we are
</p>
<p>using the convention that ω is always positive; waves going in the�x direction will
be described by negative k. The cutoff frequencies ωR and ωL are called the right-
</p>
<p>hand and left-hand cutoffs, respectively, for reasons which will become clear in the
</p>
<p>next section.
</p>
<p>The cutoff and resonance frequencies divide the dispersion diagram into regions
</p>
<p>of propagation and non propagation. Instead of the usual ω&ndash;k diagram, it is more
</p>
<p>enlightening to give a plot of phase velocity versus frequency; or, to be precise, a
</p>
<p>plot of ω2/c2k2&frac14; 1/~n2 vs. ω (Fig. 4.36). To interpret this diagram, imagine that ωc is
fixed, and a wave with a fixed frequency ω is sent into a plasma from the outside. As
</p>
<p>the wave encounters regions of increasing density, the frequencies ωL, ωp, ωh, and
</p>
<p>ωR all increase, moving to the right in the diagram. This is the same as if the density
</p>
<p>118 4 Waves in Plasmas</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>were fixed and the frequency ω were gradually being decreased. Taking the latter
</p>
<p>point of view, we see that at large ω (or low density), the phase velocity approaches
</p>
<p>the velocity of light. As the wave travels further, vϕ increases until the right-hand
</p>
<p>cutoff ω&frac14;ωR is encountered. There, vϕ becomes infinite. Between the ω&frac14;ωR and
ω&frac14;ωh layers, ω2/k2 is negative, and there is no propagation possible. At ω&frac14;ωh,
there is a resonance, and vϕ goes to zero. Between ω&frac14;ωh and ω&frac14;ωL, propagation
is again possible. In this region, the wave travels either faster or slower than
</p>
<p>c depending on whether ω is smaller or larger than ωp. From Eq. (4.104), it is
</p>
<p>clear that at ω&frac14;ωp, the wave travels at the velocity c. For ω&lt;ωL, there is another
region of nonpropagation. The extraordinary wave, therefore, has two regions of
</p>
<p>propagation separated by a stop band.
</p>
<p>By way of comparison, we show in Fig. 4.37 the same sort of diagram for the
</p>
<p>ordinary wave. This dispersion relation has only one cutoff and no resonances.

<p>The R and L waves turn out to be circularly polarized, the designations R and
</p>
<p>L meaning, respectively, right-hand circular polarization and left-hand circular
</p>
<p>polarization (Problem 4.17). The geometry is shown in Fig. 4.38. The electric field
</p>
<p>vector for the R wave rotates clockwise in time as viewed along the direction of B0,
and vice versa for the L wave. Since Eqs. (4.116) and (4.117) depend only on k2, the
</p>
<p>direction of rotation of the E vector is independent of the sign of k; the polarization
is the same for waves propagating in the opposite direction. To summarize: The
</p>
<p>principal electromagnetic waves propagating along B0 are a right-hand (R) and a
left-hand (L ) circularly polarized wave; the principal waves propagating across B0
are a plane-polarized wave (O-wave) and an elliptically polarized wave (X-wave).
</p>
<p>We next consider the cutoffs and resonances of the R and L waves. For the R
</p>
<p>wave, k becomes infinite at ω&frac14;ωc; the wave is then in resonance with the cyclotron
motion of the electrons. The direction of rotation of the plane of polarization is the
</p>
<p>same as the direction of gyration of electrons; the wave loses its energy in
</p>
<p>continuously accelerating the electrons, and it cannot propagate. The L wave, on
</p>
<p>the other hand, does not have a cyclotron resonance with the electrons because it
</p>
<p>rotates in the opposite sense. As is easily seen from Eq. (4.117), the Lwave does not
</p>
<p>have a resonance for positive ω. If we had included ion motions in our treatment,
</p>

</p>
<p>circularly polarized waves
</p>
<p>propagating along B0
</p>
<p>4.16 Electromagnetic Waves Parallel to B0 121</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the L wave would have been found to have a resonance at ω&frac14;Ωc, since it would
then rotate with the ion gyration.
</p>
<p>The cutoffs are obtained by setting k&frac14; 0 in Eqs. (4.116) and (4.117). We then
obtain the same equations as we had for the cutoffs of the X wave (Eq. (4.107)).
</p>
<p>Thus the cutoff frequencies are the same as before. The Rwave, with the minus sign
</p>
<p>in Eqs. (4.116) and (4.107), has the higher cutoff frequency ωR given by
</p>
<p>Eq. (4.108); the L wave, with the plus sign, has the lower cutoff frequency ωL.
</p>
<p>This is the reason for the notation ωR, ωL chosen previously. The dispersion
</p>
<p>diagram for the R and L waves is shown in Fig. 4.39. The L wave has a stop band
</p>
<p>at low frequencies; it behaves like the O wave except that the cutoff occurs at ωL
instead of ωp. The R wave has a stop band between ωR and ωc, but there is a second
</p>
<p>band of propagation, with vϕ&lt; c, below ωc. The wave in this low-frequency region
is called the whistler mode and is of extreme importance in the study of ionospheric
</p>
<p>phenomena.

<p>of the R wave. When a lightning flash occurs in the Southern Hemisphere, radio
</p>
<p>noise of all frequencies is generated. Among the waves generated in the plasma

<p>of the ionosphere and magnetosphere are R waves traveling along the earth&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>magnetic field. These waves are guided by the field lines and are detected by
</p>
<p>observers in Canada. However, different frequencies arrive at different times.
</p>
<p>From Fig. 4.39, it can be seen that for ω&lt;ωc/2, the phase velocity increases with
frequency (Problem 4.19). It can also be shown (Problem 4.20) that the group
</p>
<p>velocity increases with frequency. Thus the low frequencies arrive later, giving
</p>
<p>rise to the descending tone. several whistles can be produced by a single lightning
</p>
<p>flash because of propagation along different tubes of force A, B, C (Fig. 4.41).
</p>
<p>Since the waves have ω&lt;ωc, they must have frequencies lower than the lowest
gyrofrequency along the tube of force, about 100 kHz. Either the whistles lie
</p>
<p>directly in the audio range or they can easily be converted into audio signals by

<p>heterodyning.

<p>4.17.2 Faraday Rotation
</p>
<p>A plane-polarized wave sent along a magnetic field in a plasma will suffer a rotation
</p>
<p>of its plane of polarization (Fig. 4.42). This can be understood in terms of the
</p>
<p>difference in phase velocity of the R and L waves. From Fig. 4.39, it is clear that for
</p>
<p>large ω the R wave travels faster than the L wave. Consider the plane-polarized
</p>
<p>wave to be the sum of an R wave and an L wave (Fig. 4.43). Both waves are, of
</p>
<p>course, at the same frequency. After N cycles, the EL and ER vectors will return to
</p>
<p>their initial positions. After traversing a given distance d, however, the R and
</p>
<p>L waves will have undergone a different number of cycles, since they require a
</p>
<p>different amount of time to cover the distance. Since the L wave travels more
</p>
<p>slowly, it will have undergone N + E cycles at the position where the R wave has
</p>
<p>undergone N cycles. The vectors then have the positions shown in Fig. 4.44. The
</p>
<p>plane of polarization is seen to have rotated. A measurement of this rotation by
</p>
<p>means of a microwave horn can be used to give a value of ω2p and, hence, of the
</p>
<p>density (Problem 4.22). The effect of Faraday rotation has been verified experi-
</p>
<p>mentally, but it is not as useful a method of density measurement as microwave
</p>
<p>interferometry, because access at the ends of a plasma column is usually difficult,

<p>and because the effect is small unless the density is so high that refraction
</p>
<p>becomes a problem.
</p>
<p>When powerful pulsed lasers are used to produce a dense plasma by vaporizing a
</p>
<p>solid target, magnetic fields of megagauss intensities are sometimes spontaneously
</p>
<p>generated. These have been detected by Faraday rotation using laser light of higher
</p>
<p>frequency than the main beam. In interstellar space, the path lengths are so long that
</p>
<p>Faraday rotation is important even at very low densities. This effect has been used
</p>
<p>to explain the polarization of microwave radiation generated by maser action in
</p>
<p>clouds of OH or H2O molecules during the formation of new stars.

position and watches the helix pass by.

<p>4.18 Hydromagnetic Waves
</p>
<p>The last part of our survey of fundamental plasma waves concerns low-frequency
</p>
<p>ion oscillations in the presence of a magnetic field. Of the many modes possible, we
</p>
<p>shall treat only two: the hydromagnetic wave along B0, or Alfvén wave, and the
magnetosonic wave. The Alfvén wave in plane geometry has k along B0; E1 and j1
perpendicular to B0; and B1 and v1 perpendicular to both B0 and E1 (Fig. 4.45).
From Maxwell&rsquo;s equation we have, as usual (Eq. (4.80)),

</p>
<p>Note that vA is small for well-developed plasmas with appreciable density, and

</p>
<p>To understand what happens physically in an Alfvén wave, recall that this is an
</p>
<p>electromagnetic wave with a fluctuating magnetic field B1 given by
</p>
<p>&nabla; � E1 &frac14; � _B1 Ex &frac14; ω=k&eth; &THORN;By &eth;4:128&THORN;
</p>
<p>The small component By, when added to B0, gives the lines of force a sinusoidal
ripple, shown exaggerated in Fig. 4.46. At the point shown, By is in the positive
</p>
<p>y direction, so, according to Eq. (4.128), Ex is in the positive x direction if ω/k is in
</p>
<p>the z direction. The electric field Ex gives the plasma an E1�B0 drift in the negative
y direction. Since we have taken the limit ω2 	 Ω2c ; both ions and electrons will
have the same drift vy, according to Eqs. (4.120) and (4.121). Thus, the fluid moves
</p>
<p>up and down in the y direction, as previously indicated in Fig. 4.45. The magnitude
</p>
<p>of this velocity is |Ex/B0|. Since the ripple in the field is moving by at the phase
</p>
<p>velocity ω/k, the line of force is also moving downward at the point indicated in
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.46. The downward velocity of the line of force is (ω/k)|By/B0|, which,
</p>
<p>according to Eq. (4.128), is just equal to the fluid velocity |Ex/B0|. Thus, the fluid
</p>
<p>and the field lines oscillate together as if the particles were stuck to the lines. The
</p>
<p>lines of force act as if they were mass-loaded strings under tension, and an Alfvén
</p>
<p>wave can be regarded as the propagating disturbance occurring when the strings are
</p>
<p>plucked. This concept of plasma frozen to lines of force and moving with them is a
</p>
<p>useful one for understanding many low-frequency plasma phenomena. It can be
</p>
<p>shown that this notion is an accurate one as long as there is no electric field along B.
It remains for us to see what sustains the electric field Ex which we presupposed
</p>
<p>was there. As E1 fluctuates, the ions&rsquo; inertia causes them to lag behind the electrons,
and there is a polarization drift vp in the direction of E1. This drift vix is given by
Eq. (4.120) and causes a current j1 to flow in the x direction. The resulting j1�B0
force on the fluid is in the y direction and is 90� out of phase with the velocity v1.

<p>This force perpetuates the oscillation in the same way as in any oscillator where the
</p>
<p>force is out of phase with the velocity. It is, of course, always the ion inertia that
</p>
<p>causes an overshoot and a sustained oscillation, but in a plasma the momentum is
</p>
<p>transferred in a complicated way via the electromagnetic forces.
</p>
<p>In a more realistic geometry for experiments, E1 would be in the radial direction
and v1 in the azimuthal direction (Fig. 4.47). The motion of the plasma is then
incompressible. This is the reason the &nabla;p term in the equation of motion could be
</p>
<p>neglected. This mode is called the torsional Alfvén wave or shear Alfvén wave. It
</p>
<p>was first produced in liquid mercury by B. Lehnert.
</p>
<p>Alfvén waves in a plasma were first generated and detected by Allen, Baker,
</p>
<p>Pyle, and Wilcox at Berkeley, California, and by Jephcott in England in 1959. The
</p>
<p>work was done in a hydrogen plasma created in a &ldquo;slow pinch&rdquo; discharge between
</p>
<p>two electrodes aligned along a magnetic field (Fig. 4.48). Discharge of a slow
</p>
<p>capacitor bank A created the plasma. The fast capacitor B, connected to the metal
</p>
<p>wall, was then fired to create an electric field E1 perpendicular to B0. The ringing of
the capacitor generated a wave, which was detected, with an appropriate time delay,

<p>demonstrating the linear dependence predicted by Eq. (4.126).
</p>
<p>This experiment was a difficult one, because a large magnetic field of 1 T was
</p>
<p>needed to overcome damping. With large B0, vA (and hence the wavelength),
become uncomfortably large unless the density is high. In the experiment of Wilcox
</p>
<p>et al., a density of 6� 1021 m�3 was used to achieve a low Alfvén speed of
2.8� 105 m/s. Note that it is not possible to increase ρ by using a heavier atom.
The frequency ω&frac14; kvA is proportional toM�1/2, while the cyclotron frequencyΩc is
proportional toM�1. Therefore, the ratio ω/Ωc is proportional toM

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This is the dispersion relation for themagnetosonic wave propagating perpendicular
</p>
<p>to B0. It is an acoustic wave in which the compressions and rarefactions are
produced not by motions along E, but by E�B drifts across E. In the limit
B0! 0, vA! 0, the magnetosonic wave turns into an ordinary ion acoustic wave.
In the limit KT! 0, vs! 0, the pressure gradient forces vanish, and the wave
becomes a modified Alfvén wave. The phase velocity of the magnetosonic mode
</p>
<p>is almost always larger than vA; for this reason, it is often called simply the &ldquo;fast&rdquo;
</p>
<p>hydromagnetic wave.

<p>This set of dispersion relations is a greatly simplified one covering only the
</p>
<p>principal directions of propagation. Nonetheless, it is a very useful set of equations
</p>
<p>to have in mind as a frame of reference for discussing more complicated wave
</p>
<p>motions. It is often possible to understand a complex situation as a modification or
</p>
<p>superposition of these basic modes of oscillation.
</p>
<p>4.21 The CMA Diagram
</p>
<p>When propagation occurs at an angle to the magnetic field, the phase velocities
</p>
<p>change with angle. Some of the modes listed above with kkB0 and k &perp; B0 change
continuously into each other; other modes simply disappear at a critical angle. This
</p>
<p>complicated state of affairs is greatly clarified by the Clemmow&ndash;Mullaly&ndash;Allis
</p>
<p>(CMA) diagram, so named for its co-inventors by T. H. Stix. Such a diagram is
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 4.51. The CMA diagram is valid, however, only for cold plasmas,
</p>
<p>with Ti&frac14; Te&frac14; 0. Extension to finite temperatures introduces so much complexity
that the diagram is no longer useful.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.51 is a plot of ωc/ω vs. ω
2
p/ω
</p>
<p>2 or, equivalently, a plot of magnetic field
</p>
<p>vs. density. For a given frequencyω, any experimental situation characterized by ωp
and ωc is denoted by a point on the graph. The total space is divided into sections by
</p>
<p>the various cutoffs and resonances we have encountered. For instance, the extraor-
</p>
<p>dinary wave cutoff at ω2 &frac14; ω2c &thorn; ω2p is a quadratic relation between ωc/ω and ω2p/
ω2; the resulting parabola can be recognized on Fig. 4.51 as the curve labeled
</p>
<p>&ldquo;upper hybrid resonance.&rdquo; These cutoff and resonance curves separate regions of
</p>
<p>propagation and nonpropagation for the various waves. The sets of waves that can
</p>
<p>exist in the different regions will therefore be different.
</p>
<p>4.21 The CMA Diagram 135</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The small diagram in each region indicates not only which waves are present but
</p>
<p>also how the phase velocity varies qualitatively with angle. The magnetic field is
</p>
<p>imagined to be vertical on the diagram. The distance from the center to any point on
</p>
<p>an ellipse or figure-eight at an angle θ to the vertical is proportional to the phase
</p>
<p>velocity at that angle with respect to the magnetic field. For instance, in the
</p>

<p>triangular region marked with an * on Fig. 4.51, we see that the Lwave becomes the
</p>
<p>X wave as θ varies from zero to π/2. The R wave has a velocity smaller than
</p>
<p>the L wave, and it disappears as θ varies from zero to π/2. It does not turn into the
</p>
<p>O wave, because ω2 &lt; ω2p in that region, and the O wave does not exist.
</p>
<p>The upper regions of the CMA diagram correspond to ω 	 ωc: The
low-frequency ion waves are found here. Since thermal velocities have been
</p>
<p>neglected on this diagram, the electrostatic ion waves do not appear; they propagate
</p>
<p>only in warm plasmas. One can regard the CMA diagram as a &ldquo;plasma pond&rdquo;: A
</p>
<p>pebble dropped in each region will send out ripples with shapes like the ones shown.

</p>
<p>satisfy the condition ω	Ωc, you make ω&frac14; 0.1Ωc.
(a) If you could create a hydrogen plasma with n&frac14; 1019 m�3 and B&frac14; 1 T,
</p>
<p>how long does the column have to be?
</p>
<p>(b) If you tried to do this with a 0.3 T Q-machine, in which the singly

<p>charged Cs ions have an atomic weight 133 and a density n&frac14; 1018 m�3,
how long would the plasma have to be? Hint: Figure out the scaling

4.34. Figure P4.34 shows a far-infrared laser operating at λ&frac14; 337 μm. When
</p>
<p>B0&frac14; 0, this radiation easily penetrates the plasma whenever ωp is less than
ω, or n&lt; nc&frac14; 1022 m�3. However, because of the long path length, the
defocusing effect of the plasma (cf. Fig. 4.30) spoils the optical cavity, and
</p>
<p>the density is limited by the conditionsω2p &lt; εω

<p>Diffusion and Resistivity
</p>
<p>5.1 Diffusion and Mobility in Weakly Ionized Gases
</p>
<p>The infinite, homogeneous plasmas assumed in the previous chapter for the equilib-
</p>
<p>rium conditions are, of course, highly idealized. Any realistic plasma will have a
</p>
<p>density gradient, and the plasma will tend to diffuse toward regions of low density.
</p>
<p>The central problem in controlled thermonuclear reactions is to impede the rate of
</p>
<p>diffusion by using a magnetic field. Before tackling the magnetic field problem,
</p>
<p>however, we shall consider the case of diffusion in the absence of magnetic fields. A
</p>
<p>further simplification results if we assume that the plasma is weakly ionized, so that
</p>
<p>charge particles collide primarily with neutral atoms rather than with one another.
</p>
<p>The case of a fully ionized plasma is deferred to a later section, since it results in a
</p>
<p>nonlinear equation for which there are few simple illustrative solutions. In any case,
</p>
<p>partially ionized gases are not rare: High-pressure arcs and ionospheric plasmas fall
</p>
<p>into this category, and most of the early work on gas discharges involved fractional
</p>
<p>ionizations between 10�3 and 10�6, when collisions with neutral atoms are dominant.
</p>
<p>The picture, then, is of a nonuniform distribution of ions and electrons in a dense
</p>
<p>background of neutrals (Fig. 5.1). As the plasma spreads out as a result of pressure-
</p>
<p>gradient and electric field forces, the individual particles undergo a random walk,
</p>
<p>colliding frequently with the neutral atoms. We begin with a brief review of
</p>
<p>definitions from atomic theory.
</p>
<p>5.1.1 Collision Parameters
</p>
<p>When an electron, say, collides with a neutral atom, it may lose any fraction of its
</p>
<p>initial momentum, depending on the angle at which it rebounds. In a head-on

<p>collision with a heavy atom, the electron can lose twice its initial momentum, since
</p>
<p>its velocity reverses sign after the collision. The probability of momentum loss can
</p>
<p>be expressed in terms of the equivalent cross section σ that the atoms would have if
</p>
<p>they were perfect absorbers of momentum.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 5.2, electrons are incident upon a slab of area A and thickness dx
</p>
<p>containing nn neutral atoms per m
3. The atoms are imagined to be opaque spheres
</p>
<p>of cross-sectional area σ; that is, every time an electron
</p>
<p>comes within the area blocked by the atom, the electron loses all of its momen-
</p>
<p>tum. The number of atoms in the slab is
</p>

<p>If a flux Γ of electrons is incident on the slab, the flux emerging on the other side is
</p>
<p>Γ
0
</p>
<p>&frac14; Γ 1� nnσ dx&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>Thus the change of Γ with distance is

</p>
<p>Γ &frac14; Γ0e
�nnσx � Γ0e
</p>
<p>�x=λm &eth;5:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>In a distance λm, the flux would be decreased to 1/e of its initial value. The quantity
</p>
<p>λm is the mean free path for collisions:
</p>
<p>λm &frac14; 1=nnσ &eth;5:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>After traveling a distance λm, a particle will have had a good probability of making a
</p>
<p>collision. The mean time between collisions, for particles of velocity v, is given by
</p>
<p>τ &frac14; λm=v
</p>
<p>and the mean frequency of collisions is
</p>
<p>τ�1 &frac14; v=λm &frac14; nnσv &eth;5:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>If we now average over particles of all velocities v in a Maxwellian distribution, we
</p>
<p>have what is generally called the collision frequency ν:
</p>
<p>ν &frac14; nnσv &eth;5:4&THORN;

</p>
<p>where again the � indicates the sign of the charge. The averaging process used to
compute ν is such as to make Eq. (5.5) correct; we need not be concerned with the
</p>
<p>details of this computation. The quantity ν must, however, be assumed to be a
</p>
<p>constant in order for Eq. (5.5) to be useful. We shall consider a steady state in which
</p>
<p>&part;v/&part;t&frac14; 0. If v is sufficiently small (or ν sufficiently large), a fluid element will not
move into regions of different E and &nabla;p in a collision time, and the convective

<p>μ � jqj=mν Mobility &eth;5:7&THORN;
</p>
<p>D � KT=mν Diffusion coefficient &eth;5:8&THORN;
</p>
<p>These will be different for each species. Note that D is measured in m2/s. The
</p>
<p>transport coefficients μ and D are connected by the Einstein relation:
</p>
<p>μ &frac14; jqjD=KT &eth;5:9&THORN;
</p>
<p>With the help of these definitions, the flux Γj of the jth species can be written
</p>
<p>Γ j &frac14; nv j &frac14; �μ jnE� D j&nabla;n &eth;5:10&THORN;
</p>
<p>Fick&rsquo;s law of diffusion is a special case of this, occurring when either E&frac14; 0 or the
particles are uncharged, so that μ&frac14; 0:
</p>
<p>Γ &frac14; �D&nabla;n Fick, s law &eth;5:11&THORN;
</p>
<p>This equation merely expresses the fact that diffusion is a random-walk process, in
</p>
<p>which a net flux from dense regions to less dense regions occurs simply because
</p>
<p>more particles start in the dense region. This flux is obviously proportional to the
</p>
<p>gradient of the density. In plasmas, Fick&rsquo;s law is not necessarily obeyed. Because of
</p>
<p>the possibility of organized motions (plasma waves), a plasma may spread out in a
</p>
<p>manner which is not truly random.
</p>
<p>5.2 Decay of a Plasma by Diffusion
</p>
<p>5.2.1 Ambipolar Diffusion
</p>
<p>We now consider how a plasma created in a container decays by diffusion to the
</p>
<p>walls. Once ions and electrons reach the wall, they recombine there. The density
</p>
<p>near the wall, therefore, is essentially zero. The fluid equations of motion and
</p>
<p>148 5 Diffusion and Resistivity</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>continuity govern the plasma behavior; but if the decay is slow, we need only
</p>
<p>keep the time derivative in the continuity equation. The time derivative in the
</p>
<p>equation of motion, Eq. (5.5), will be negligible if the collision frequency ν is large.
</p>
<p>We thus have
</p>
<p>&part;n
</p>
<p>&part;t
&thorn;&nabla; � Γj &frac14; 0 &eth;5:12&THORN;
</p>
<p>with Γj given by Eq. (5.10). It is clear that if Γi and Γe were not equal, a serious
</p>
<p>charge imbalance would soon arise. If the plasma is much larger than a Debye
</p>
<p>length, it must be quasineutral; and one would expect that the rates of diffusion of
</p>
<p>ions and electrons would somehow adjust themselves so that the two species leave
</p>
<p>at the same rate. How this happens is easy to see. The electrons, being lighter, have
</p>
<p>higher thermal velocities and tend to leave the plasma first. A positive charge is left
</p>
<p>behind, and an electric field is set up of such a polarity as to retard the loss of
</p>
<p>electrons and accelerate the loss of ions. The required E field is found by setting
Γi&frac14;Γe&frac14;Γ. From Eq. (5.10), we can write
</p>
<p>Γ &frac14; μinE� Di&nabla;n &frac14; �μenE� De&nabla;n &eth;5:13&THORN;
</p>
<p>E &frac14;
Di � De
μi &thorn; μe
</p>
<p>&nabla;n
</p>
<p>n
&eth;5:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>The common flux Γ is then given by
</p>
<p>Γ &frac14; μi
Di � De
μi &thorn; μe
</p>
<p>&nabla;n� Di&nabla;n

<p>&frac14; �
μiDe &thorn; μeDi
</p>
<p>μi &thorn; μe
&nabla;n
</p>
<p>&eth;5:15&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is Fick&rsquo;s law with a new diffusion coefficient
</p>
<p>Da �
μiDe &thorn; μeDi
</p>
<p>μi &thorn; μe
&eth;5:16&THORN;
</p>
<p>called the ambipolar diffusion coefficient. If this is constant, Eq. (5.12) becomes
</p>
<p>simply
</p>
<p>&part;n=&part;t &frac14; Da&nabla;
2n &eth;5:17&THORN;
</p>
<p>The magnitude of Da can be estimated if we take μe� μi. That this is true can be
seen from Eq. (5.7). Since ν is proportional to the thermal velocity, which is
</p>
<p>5.2 Decay of a Plasma by Diffusion 149</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>proportional to m�1/2, μ is proportional to m�1/2. Equations (5.16) and (5.9)
</p>
<p>then give

</p>
<p>For Te&frac14;Ti, we have
</p>
<p>Da � 2Di &eth;5:19&THORN;
</p>
<p>The effect of the ambipolar electric field is to enhance the diffusion of ions by a
</p>
<p>factor of two, and the diffusion rate of the two species together is primarily
</p>
<p>controlled by the slower species.
</p>
<p>5.2.2 Diffusion in a Slab
</p>
<p>The diffusion equation (5.17) can easily be solved by the method of separation of
</p>
<p>variables. We let
</p>
<p>n r; t&eth; &THORN; &frac14; T t&eth; &THORN;S r&eth; &THORN; &eth;5:20&THORN;
</p>
<p>whereupon Eq. (5.17), with the subscript on Da understood, becomes

<p>proceed as indicated in Fig. 5.4. First, the fine structure will be washed out by
</p>
<p>diffusion. Then the lowest diffusion mode, the simple cosine distribution of
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.3, will be reached. Finally, the peak density continues to decay while the
</p>
<p>plasma density profile retains the same shape.
</p>
<p>5.2.3 Diffusion in a Cylinder
</p>
<p>The spatial part of the diffusion equation, Eq. (5.25), reads, in cylindrical geometry,

</p>
<p>Dτ
S &frac14; 0 &eth;5:34&THORN;
</p>
<p>This differs from Eq. (5.26) by the addition of the middle term, which merely
</p>
<p>accounts for the change in coordinates. The need for the extra term is illustrated
</p>
<p>simply in Fig. 5.5. If a slice of plasma in (a) is moved toward larger x without being
</p>
<p>allowed to expand, the density would remain constant. On the other hand, if a shell
</p>
<p>of plasma in (b) is moved toward larger r with the shell thickness kept constant, the
</p>
<p>density would necessarily decrease as 1/r. Consequently, one would expect the
</p>
<p>solution to Eq. (5.34) to be like a damped cosine (Fig. 5.6). This function is called a
</p>
<p>Bessel function of order zero, and Eq. (5.34) is called Bessel&rsquo;s equation (of order
</p>
<p>zero). Instead of the symbol cos, it is given the symbol J0. The function J0(r/[Dτ]
1/2)
</p>
<p>is a solution to Eq. (5.34), just as cos [x/(Dτ)1/2] is a solution to Eq. (5.26). Both cos
</p>
<p>kx and J0(kr) are expressible in terms of infinite series and may be found in
</p>
<p>mathematical tables. Unfortunately, Bessel functions are not yet found in most
</p>
<p>hand calculators.
</p>
<p>To satisfy the boundary condition n&frac14; 0 at r&frac14; a, we must set a/(Dτ)l/2 equal to
the first zero of J0; namely, 2.4. This yields the decay time constant τ. The plasma
</p>
<p>again decays exponentially, since the temporal part of the diffusion equation,
</p>
<p>Eq. (5.23), is unchanged. We have described the lowest diffusion mode in a

<p>cylinder. Higher diffusion modes, with more than one maximum in the cylinder,
</p>
<p>will be given in terms of Bessel functions of higher order, in direct analogy to the
</p>
<p>case of slab geometry.
</p>
<p>5.3 Steady State Solutions
</p>
<p>In many experiments, a plasma is maintained in a steady state by continuous
</p>
<p>ionization or injection of plasma to offset the losses. To calculate the density profile
</p>
<p>in this case, we must add a source term to the equation of continuity:
</p>
<p>&part;n
</p>
<p>&part;t
� D&nabla;2n &frac14; Q r&eth; &THORN; &eth;5:35&THORN;
</p>
<p>The sign is chosen so that when Q is positive, it represents a source and contributes
</p>
<p>to positive &part;n/&part;t. In steady state, we set &part;n/&part;t&frac14; 0 and are left with a Poisson-type
equation for n(r).
</p>
<p>5.3.1 Constant Ionization Function
</p>
<p>In many weakly ionized gases, ionization is produced by energetic electrons in the
</p>
<p>tail of the Maxwellian distribution. In this case, the source term Q is proportional to
</p>
<p>the electron density n. SettingQ&frac14; Zn,where Z is the &ldquo;ionization function,&rdquo; we have
</p>
<p>&nabla;
2n &frac14; � Z=D&eth; &THORN;n &eth;5:36&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is the same equation as that for S, Eq. (5.25). Consequently, the density profile
</p>
<p>is a cosine or Bessel function, as in the case of a decaying plasma, only in this case
</p>
<p>the density remains constant. The plasma is maintained against diffusion losses by
</p>
<p>whatever heat source keeps the electron temperature at its constant value and by a
</p>
<p>small influx of neutral atoms to replenish those that are ionized.

<p>5.3.2 Plane Source
</p>
<p>We next consider what profile would be obtained in slab geometry if there is a
</p>
<p>localized source on the plane x&frac14; 0. Such a source might be, for instance, a slit-
collimated beam of ultraviolet light strong enough to ionize the neutral gas. The

</p>
<p>5.3.3 Line Source
</p>
<p>Finally, we consider a cylindrical plasma with a source located on the axis. Such a
</p>
<p>source might, for instance, be a beam of energetic electrons producing ionization
</p>
<p>along the axis. Except at r&frac14; 0, the density must satisfy

</p>
<p>The density becomes infinite at r&frac14; 0 (Fig. 5.8); it is not possible to determine the
density near the axis accurately without considering the finite width of the source.
</p>
<p>5.4 Recombination
</p>
<p>When an ion and an electron collide, particularly at low relative velocity, they have
</p>
<p>a finite probability of recombining into a neutral atom. To conserve momentum, a
</p>
<p>third body must be present. If this third body is an emitted photon, the process is
</p>
<p>called radiative recombination. If it is a particle, the process is called three-body
</p>
<p>recombination. The loss of plasma by recombination can be represented by a
</p>
<p>negative source term in the equation of continuity. It is clear that this term will
</p>
<p>be proportional to neni&frac14; n
2. In the absence of the diffusion terms, the equation of
</p>
<p>continuity then becomes
</p>
<p>&part;n=&part;t &frac14; �αn2 &eth;5:41&THORN;
</p>
<p>The constant of proportionality α is called the recombination coefficient and has
</p>
<p>units of m3/s. Equation (5.41) is a nonlinear equation for n. This means that the
</p>
<p>straightforward method for satisfying initial and boundary conditions by linear
</p>
<p>superposition of solutions is not available. Fortunately, Eq. (5.41) is such a simple
</p>
<p>nonlinear equation that the solution can be found by inspection. It is

<p>where n0(r) is the initial density distribution. It is easily verified that this satisfies
Eq. (5.41). After the density has fallen far below its initial value, it decays
</p>
<p>reciprocally with time:
</p>
<p>n / 1=αt &eth;5:43&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is a fundamentally different behavior from the case of diffusion, in which the
</p>
<p>time variation is exponential.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.9 shows the results of measurements of the density decay in the
</p>
<p>afterglow of a weakly ionized H plasma. When the density is high, recombination,
</p>
<p>which is proportional to n2, is dominant, and the density decays reciprocally. After
</p>
<p>the density has reached a low value, diffusion becomes dominant, and the decay is
</p>
<p>thenceforth exponential.
</p>
<p>5.5 Diffusion Across a Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>The rate of plasma loss by diffusion can be decreased by a magnetic field; this is the
</p>
<p>problem of confinement in controlled fusion research. Consider a weakly ionized
</p>
<p>plasma in a magnetic field (Fig. 5.10). Charged particles will move along B by
diffusion and mobility according to Eq. (5.10), since B does not affect motion in the
parallel direction. Thus we have, for each species,

</p>
<p>If there were no collisions, particles would not diffuse at all in the perpendicular
</p>
<p>direction&mdash;they would continue to gyrate about the same-line of force. There are, of
</p>
<p>course, particle drifts across B because of electric fields or gradients in B, but these
can be arranged to be parallel to the walls. For instance, in a perfectly symmetrie
</p>
<p>cylinder (Fig. 5.11), the gradients are all in the radial direction, so that the guiding
</p>
<p>center drifts are in the azimuthal direction. The drifts would then be harmless.
</p>
<p>When there are collisions, particles migrate across B to the walls along the
gradients. They do this by a random-walk process (Fig. 5.12). When an ion, say,
</p>
<p>collides with a neutral atom, the ion leaves the collision traveling in a different
</p>
<p>direction. It continues to gyrate about the magnetic field in the same direction, but
</p>
<p>its phase of gyration is changed discontinuously. (The Larmor radius may also
</p>
<p>change, but let us suppose that the ion does not gain or lose energy on the average.)
</p>
<p>The guiding center, therefore, shifts position in a collision and undergoes a
</p>
<p>random walk. The particles will diffuse in the direction opposite &nabla;n. The step
</p>
<p>length in the random walk is no longer λm, as in magnetic-field-free diffusion, but
</p>
<p>has instead the magnitude of the Larmor radius rL. Diffusion across B can therefore
be slowed down by decreasing rL; that is, by increasing B.

<p>neutrals; the drag factor 1&thorn; ν2=ω2c

the motion. In diffusion perpendicular to B, D&perp; is proportional to ν, since collisions
are needed for cross-field migration. The dependence on m has also been reversed.

<p>Keeping in mind that ν is proportional to m�1/2, we see that D / m�1/2, while

</p>
<p>5.5.1 Ambipolar Diffusion Across B
</p>
<p>Because the diffusion and mobility coefficients are anisotropic in the presence of a
</p>
<p>magnetic field, the problem of ambipolar diffusion is not as straightforward as in the
</p>
<p>B&frac14; 0 case. Consider the particle fluxes perpendicular to B (Fig. 5.13). Ordinarily,
since Γe&perp; is smaller than Γi&perp;, a transverse electric field would be set up so as to aid
</p>
<p>electron diffusion and retard ion diffusion. However, this electric field can be short-
</p>
<p>circuited by an imbalance of the fluxes along B. That is, the negative charge
resulting from Γe&perp;&lt;Γi&perp; can be dissipated by electrons escaping along the field
lines. Although the total diffusion must be ambipolar, the perpendicular part of the
</p>
<p>losses need not be ambipolar. The ions can diffuse out primarily radially, while the
</p>
<p>electrons diffuse out primarily along B. Whether or not this in fact happens depends
on the particular experiment. In short plasma columns with the field lines termi-
</p>
<p>nating on conducting plates, one would expect the ambipolar electric field to be
</p>
<p>short-circuited out. Each species then diffuses radially at a different rate. In long,
</p>
<p>thin plasma columns terminated by insulating plates, one would expect the radial
</p>
<p>diffusion to be ambipolar because escape along B is arduous.

<p>parallel diffusion can be neglected altogether, there is no simple answer to the
</p>
<p>problem of ambipolar diffusion across a magnetic field.
</p>
<p>5.5.2 Experimental Checks
</p>
<p>Whether or not a magnetic field reduces transverse diffusion in accordance with
</p>
<p>Eq. (5.51) became the subject of numerous investigations. The first experiment
</p>
<p>performed in a tube long enough that diffusion to the ends could be neglected was
</p>
<p>that of Lehnert and Hoh in Sweden. They used a helium positive column about 1 cm
</p>
<p>in diameter and 3.5 m long (Fig. 5.14). In such a plasma, the electrons are
</p>
<p>continuously lost by radial diffusion to the walls and are replenished by ionization
</p>
<p>of the neutral gas by the electrons in the tail of the velocity distribution. These fast
</p>
<p>electrons, in turn, are replenished by acceleration in the longitudinal electric field.
</p>
<p>Consequently, one would expect Ez to be roughly proportional to the rate of
</p>
<p>transverse diffusion. Two probes set in the wall of the discharge tube were used
</p>
<p>to measure Ez as Bwas varied. The ratio of Ez(B) to Ez(0) is shown as a function of B in
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.15. At low B fields, the experimental points follow closely the predicted
</p>
<p>curve, calculated on the basis of Eq. (5.52). At a critical field Bc of about 0.2 T,
</p>
<p>however, the experimental points departed from theory and, in fact, showed an
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.14 The Lehnert-Hoh experiment to check the effect of a magnetic field on diffusion in a
weakly ionized gas
</p>
<p>162 5 Diffusion and Resistivity</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>increase of diffusion with B. The critical field Bc increased with pressure, suggesting
</p>
<p>that a critical value of ωcτ was involved and that something went wrong with the
</p>
<p>&ldquo;classical&rdquo; theory of diffusion when ωcτ was too large.
</p>
<p>The trouble was soon found by Kadomtsev and Nedospasov in the
</p>
<p>U.S.S.R. These theorists discovered that an instability should develop at high
</p>
<p>magnetic fields; that is, a plasma wave would be excited by the Ez field, and that
</p>
<p>this wave would cause enhanced radial losses. The theory correctly predicted the
</p>
<p>value of Bc. The wave, in the form of a helical distortion of the plasma column,
</p>
<p>was later seen directly in an experiment by Allen, Paulikas, and Pyle at Berkeley.
</p>
<p>This helical instability of the positive column was the first instance in which
</p>
<p>&ldquo;anomalous diffusion&rdquo; across magnetic fields was definitively explained, but the
</p>
<p>explanation was applicable only to weakly ionized gases. In the fully ionized
</p>
<p>plasmas of fusion research, anomalous diffusion proved to be a much tougher
</p>
<p>problem to solve.

<p>5.6 Collisions in Fully Ionized Plasmas
</p>
<p>When the plasma is composed of ions and electrons alone, all collisions are Coulomb
</p>
<p>collisions between charged particles. However, there is a distinct difference between
</p>
<p>(a) collisions between like particles (ion&ndash;ion or electron&ndash;electron collisions) and
</p>
<p>164 5 Diffusion and Resistivity</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(b) collisions between unlike particles (ion&ndash;electron or electron&ndash;ion collisions).
</p>
<p>Consider two identical particles colliding (Fig. 5.16). If it is a head-on collision, the
</p>
<p>particles emerge with their velocities reversed; they simply interchange their orbits,
</p>
<p>and the two guiding centers remain in the same places. The result is the same as in a
</p>
<p>glancing collision, in which the trajectories are hardly disturbed. The worst that can
</p>
<p>happen is a 90� collision, in which the velocities are changed 90� in direction. The
</p>
<p>orbits after collision will then be the dashed circles, and the guiding centers will have
</p>
<p>shifted. However, it is clear that the &ldquo;center of mass&rdquo; of the two guiding centers
</p>
<p>remains stationary. For this reason, collisions between like particles give rise to very
</p>
<p>little diffusion. This situation is to be contrasted with the case of ions colliding with
</p>
<p>neutral atoms. In that case, the final velocity of the neutral is of no concern, and the
</p>
<p>ion random-walks away from its initial position. In the case of ion&ndash;ion collisions,
</p>
<p>however, there is a detailed balance in each collision; for each ion that moves
</p>
<p>outward, there is another that moves inward as a result of the collision.
</p>
<p>When two particles of opposite charge collide, however, the situation is entirely
</p>
<p>different (Fig. 5.17). The worst case is now the 180� collision, in which the particles
</p>
<p>emerge with their velocities reversed. Since they must continue to gyrate about the
</p>
<p>lines of force in the proper sense, both guiding centers will move in the same
</p>
<p>direction. Unlike-particle collisions give rise to diffusion. The physical picture is
</p>
<p>somewhat different for ions and electrons because of the disparity in mass. The
</p>
<p>electrons bounce off the nearly stationary ions and random-walk in the usual
</p>
<p>fashion. The ions are slightly jostled in each collision and move about as a result
</p>
<p>of frequent bombardment by electrons. Nonetheless, because of the conservation of
</p>
<p>momentum in each collision, the rates of diffusion are the same for ions and
</p>
<p>electrons, as we shall show.

<p>5.6.1 Plasma Resistivity
</p>
<p>The fluid equations of motion including the effects of charged-particle collisions
</p>
<p>may be written as follows (cf. Eq. (3.47)):
</p>
<p>Mn
dvi
dt
</p>

</p>

<p>The terms Pie and Pei represent, respectively, the momentum gain of the ion fluid
caused by collisions with electrons, and vice versa. The stress tensor Pj has been
split into the isotropic part pj and the anisotropic viscosity tensor πj. Like-particle
</p>
<p>collisions, which give rise to stresses within each fluid individually, are contained in
</p>
<p>πj. Since these collisions do not give rise to much diffusion, we shall ignore the
</p>
<p>terms &nabla; &middot;πj. As for the terms Pei and Pie, which represent the friction between the
two fluids, the conservation of momentum requires

</div>

<p>We can write Pei in terms of the collision frequency in the usual manner:
</p>
<p>Pei &frac14; mn vi � ve&eth; &THORN;νei &eth;5:60&THORN;
</p>
<p>and similarly for Pie. Since the collisions are Coulomb collisions, one would expect
Pei to be proportional to the Coulomb force, which is proportional to e
</p>
<p>2 (for singly
</p>
<p>charged ions). Furthermore, Pei must be proportional to the density of electrons ne
and to the density of scattering centers ni, which, of course, is equal to ne. Finally,
</p>
<p>Pei should be proportional to the relative velocity of the two fluids. On physical
grounds, then, we can write Pei as
</p>
<p>Pei &frac14; ηe
2n2 vi � ve&eth; &THORN; &eth;5:61&THORN;

ne2

<p>m
η &eth;5:62&THORN;

<p>The constant η is the specific resistivity of the plasma; that this jibes with the usual
</p>
<p>meaning of resistivity will become clear shortly.
</p>
<p>5.6.2 Mechanics of Coulomb Collisions
</p>
<p>When an electron collides with a neutral atom, no force is felt until the electron is
</p>
<p>close to the atom on the scale of atomic dimensions; the collisions are like billiard-
</p>
<p>ball collisions. When an electron collides with an ion, the electron is gradually
</p>
<p>deflected by the long-range Coulomb field of the ion. Nonetheless, one can derive
</p>
<p>an effective cross section for this kind of collision. It will suffice for our purposes to
</p>
<p>give an order-of-magnitude estimate of the cross section. In Fig. 5.18, an electron of
</p>
<p>velocity v approaches a fixed ion of charge e. In the absence of Coulomb forces, the
electron would have a distance of closest approach r0, called the impact parameter.
</p>
<p>In the presence of a Coulomb attraction, the electron will be deflected by an angle χ,
</p>
<p>which is related to r0. The Coulomb force is
</p>
<p>F &frac14; �
e2
</p>
<p>4πε0 r2
&eth;5:63&THORN;
</p>
<p>This force is felt during the time the electron is in the vicinity of the ion; this time is
</p>
<p>roughly
</p>
<p>T � r0=v &eth;5:64&THORN;
</p>
<p>5.6 Collisions in Fully Ionized Plasmas 167</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The change in the electron&rsquo;s momentum is therefore approximately
</p>
<p>Δ mv&eth; &THORN; &frac14; jFTj �

</p>
<p>4πε0r0v
&eth;5:65&THORN;
</p>
<p>We wish to estimate the cross section for large-angle collisions, in which χ� 90�.
For a 90� collision, the change in mv is of the order of mv itself. Thus
</p>
<p>Δ mv&eth; &THORN; ffi mv ffi e2=4πε0r0v, r0 &frac14; e
2=4πε0 m v
</p>
<p>2 &eth;5:66&THORN;
</p>
<p>The cross section is then
</p>
<p>σ &frac14; πr20 &frac14; e
4=16πε20m
</p>
<p>2v4 &eth;5:67&THORN;
</p>
<p>The collision frequency is, therefore,
</p>
<p>νei &frac14; nσv &frac14; ne
4=16πε20 m
</p>
<p>2v3 &eth;5:68&THORN;

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Equation (5.70) is the resistivity based on large-angle collisions alone. In
</p>
<p>practice, because of the long range of the Coulomb force, small-angle collisions
</p>
<p>are much more frequent, and the cumulative effect of many small-angle deflections
</p>
<p>turns out to be larger than the effect of large-angle collisions. It was shown by
</p>
<p>Spitzer that Eq. (5.70) should be multiplied by a factor ln Λ:
</p>
<p>η �
πe2m1=2
</p>
<p>4πε0&eth; &THORN;

KTe&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>3=2

</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>Λ &frac14; λD=r0 &frac14; 12πnλ
3
D &eth;5:72&THORN;
</p>
<p>This factor represents the maximum impact parameter, in units of r0 as given by
</p>
<p>Eq. (5.66), averaged over a Maxwellian distribution. The maximum impact param-
</p>
<p>eter is taken to be λD because Debye shielding suppresses the Coulomb field at
</p>
<p>larger distances. Although Λ depends on n and KTe, its logarithm is insensitive to
</p>
<p>the exact values of the plasma parameters. Typical values of ln Λ are given below.
</p>
<p>KTe (eV) n (m
�3) ln Λ

<p>0.2 1015 9.1 (Q-machine)
</p>
<p>2 1017 10.2 (lab plasma)

</p>
<p>104 1021 16.0 (fusion reactor)
</p>
<p>103 1027 6.8 (laser plasma)
</p>
<p>It is evident that ln Λ varies only a factor of two as the plasma parameters range
</p>
<p>over many orders of magnitude. For most purposes, it will be sufficiently accurate
</p>
<p>to let ln Λ&frac14; 10 regardless of the type of plasma involved.
</p>
<p>5.6.3 Physical Meaning of η
</p>
<p>Let us suppose that an electric field E exists in a plasma and that the current that it
drives is all carried by the electrons, which are much more mobile than the ions. Let
</p>
<p>B&frac14; 0 and KTe&frac14; 0, so that &nabla; &middot;Pe&frac14; 0. Then, in steady state, the electron equation of
motion (5.58) reduces to
</p>
<p>enE &frac14; Pei &eth;5:73&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since j&frac14; en(vi � ve), Eq. (5.61) can be written
</p>
<p>Pei &frac14; ηen j &eth;5:74&THORN;
</p>
<p>5.6 Collisions in Fully Ionized Plasmas 169</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>so that Eq. (5.73) becomes
</p>
<p>E &frac14; η j &eth;5:75&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is simply Ohm&rsquo;s law, and the constant η is just the specific resistivity. The
</p>
<p>expression for η in a plasma, as given by Eq. (5.71) or Eq. (5.69), has several
</p>
<p>features which should be pointed out.
</p>
<p>(a) In Eq. (5.71), we see that η is independent of density (except for the weak
</p>
<p>dependence in ln Λ). This is a rather surprising result, since it means that if a
</p>
<p>field E is applied to a plasma, the current j, as given by Eq. (5.75), is
independent of the number of charge carriers. The reason is that although
</p>
<p>j increases with ne, the frictional drag against the ions increases with ni. Since
</p>
<p>ne&frac14; ni these two effects cancel. This cancellation can be seen in Eqs. (5.68)
and (5.69). The collision frequency νei is indeed proportional to n, but the
</p>
<p>factor n cancels out in η. A fully ionized plasma behaves quite differently from
</p>
<p>a weakly ionized one in this respect. In a weakly ionized plasma, we have
</p>
<p>j&frac14;�neve, ve&frac14;�μeE, so that j&frac14; neμeE. Since μe depends only on the density
of neutrals, the current is proportional to the plasma density n.
</p>
<p>(b) Equation (5.71) shows that η is proportional to (KTe)
�3/2. As a plasma is
</p>
<p>heated, the Coulomb cross section decreases, and the resistivity drops rather
</p>
<p>rapidly with increasing temperature. Plasmas at thermonuclear temperatures
</p>
<p>(tens of keV) are essentially collisionless; this is the reason so much theoret-
</p>
<p>ical research is done on collisionless plasmas. Of course, there must always be
</p>
<p>some collisions; otherwise, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any fusion reactions either. An
</p>
<p>easy way to heat a plasma is simply to pass a current through it. The I2R
</p>
<p>(or j2η) losses then turn up as an increase in electron temperature. This is called
</p>
<p>ohmic heating. The (KTe)
�3/2 dependence of η, however, does not allow this
</p>
<p>method to be used up to thermonuclear temperatures. The plasma becomes
</p>
<p>such a good conductor at temperatures above 1 keV that ohmic heating is a
</p>
<p>very slow process in that range.
</p>
<p>(c) Equation (5.68) shows that νei varies as v
�3. The fast electrons in the tail of the
</p>
<p>velocity distribution make very few collisions. The current is therefore carried
</p>
<p>mainly by these electrons rather than by the bulk of the electrons in the main
</p>
<p>body of the distribution. The strong dependence on v has another interesting
</p>
<p>consequence. If an electric field is suddenly applied to a plasma, a phenom-
</p>
<p>enon known as electron runaway can occur. A few electrons which happen to
</p>
<p>be moving fast in the direction of �E when the field is applied will have
gained so much energy before encountering an ion that they can make only a
</p>
<p>glancing collision. This allows them to pick up more energy from the electric
</p>
<p>field and decrease their collision cross section even further. If E is large
</p>
<p>enough, the cross section falls so fast that these runaway electrons never
</p>
<p>make a collision. They form an accelerated electron beam detached from the
</p>
<p>main body of the distribution.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.6.4 Numerical Values of η
</p>
<p>Exact computations of η which take into account the ion recoil in each collision and
</p>
<p>are properly averaged over the electron distribution were first given by Spitzer. The
</p>
<p>following result for hydrogen is sometimes called the Spitzer resistivity:
</p>
<p>ηk &frac14; 5:2� 10
�5 Z lnΛ
</p>
<p>T3=2 eV&eth; &THORN;
ohm-m &eth;5:76&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here Z is the ion charge number, which we have taken to be 1 elsewhere in this
</p>
<p>book. Since the dependence on M is weak, these values can also be used for other
</p>
<p>gases. The subscript jjmeans that this value of η is to be used for motions parallel to
B. For motions perpendicular to B, one should use η&perp; given by
</p>
<p>η&perp; &frac14; 2:0ηk &eth;5:77&THORN;
</p>
<p>This does not mean that conductivity along B is only two times better than
</p>
<p>conductivity across B. A factor like ω2cτ
2 still has to be taken into account. The
</p>
<p>factor 2.0 comes from a difference in weighting of the various velocities in the
</p>
<p>electron distribution. In perpendicular motions, the slow electrons, which have
</p>
<p>small Larmor radii, contribute more to the resistivity than in parallel motions.
</p>
<p>For KTe&frac14; 100 eV, Eq. (5.76) yields
</p>
<p>η &frac14; 5� 10�7ohm-m
</p>
<p>This is to be compared with various metallic conductors:
</p>
<p>copper . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . η &frac14; 2� 10�8ohm-m
stainless steel . . . . . . ::η &frac14; 7� 10�7ohm-m
mercury . . . . . . . . . . . . ::η &frac14; 10�6ohm-m
</p>
<p>A 100-eV plasma, therefore, has a conductivity like that of stainless steel.
</p>
<p>5.6.5 Pulsed Currents
</p>
<p>When a steady-state current is drawn between two electrodes aligned along the
</p>
<p>magnetic field, electrons are the dominant current carrier, and sheaths are set up at
</p>
<p>the cathode to limit the current to the set value. When the current is pulsed,
</p>
<p>however, it takes time to set up the current distribution. It was shown by Stenzel
</p>
<p>and Urrutia that this time is controlled by whistler waves (R-waves), which must
</p>
<p>travel the length of the device to communicate the voltage information.

<p>5.7 The Single-Fluid MHD Equations
</p>
<p>We now come to the problem of diffusion in a fully ionized plasma. Since the
</p>
<p>dissipative term Pei contains the difference in velocities vi� ve, it is simpler to work
with a linear combination of the ion and electron equations such that vi � ve is the
unknown rather than vi or ve separately. Up to now, we have regarded a plasma as
composed of two interpenetrating fluids. The linear combination we are going to
</p>
<p>choose will describe the plasma as a single fluid, like liquid mercury, with a mass

otherwise. This simplification is more difficult to justify. To avoid a lengthy

</p>
<p>considerably less accurate than the two-fluid equations we have been using. For

<p>problems involving resistivity, the simplicity of the MHD equations outweighs their
</p>
<p>disadvantages. The MHD equations have been used extensively by astrophysicists

<p>D&perp; &frac14;
η&perp;nΣKT
</p>
<p>B2
&eth;5:99&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is the so-called &ldquo;classical&rdquo; diffusion coefficient for a fully ionized gas.
</p>
<p>Note that D&perp; is proportional to 1/B
2, just as in the case of weakly ionized gases.
</p>
<p>This dependence is characteristic of classical diffusion and can ultimately be traced
</p>
<p>back to the random-walk process with a step length rL. Equation (5.99), however,
</p>
<p>differs from Eq. (5.54) for a partially ionized gas in three essential ways. First,D&perp; is
</p>
<p>not a constant in a fully ionized gas; it is proportional to n. This is because the
</p>
<p>density of scattering centers is not fixed by the neutral atom density but is the
</p>
<p>plasma density itself. Second, since η is proportional to (KT)�3/2,D&perp; decreases with
</p>
<p>increasing temperature in a fully ionized gas. The opposite is true in a partially
</p>
<p>ionized gas. The reason for the difference is the velocity dependence of the
</p>
<p>Coulomb cross section. Third, diffusion is automatically ambipolar in a fully
</p>
<p>ionized gas (as long as like-particle collisions are neglected). D&perp; in Eq. (5.99) is
</p>
<p>the coefficient for the entire fluid; no ambipolar electric field arises, because both
</p>
<p>species diffuse at the same rate. This is a consequence of the conservation of
</p>
<p>momentum in ion-electron collisions. This point is somewhat clearer if one uses
</p>
<p>the two-fluid equations (see Problem 5.15).
</p>
<p>Finally, we wish to point out that there is no transverse mobility in a fully
</p>
<p>ionized gas. Equation (5.96) for v&perp; contains no component along E which depends
on E. If a transverse E field is applied to a uniform plasma, both species drift
together with the E�B velocity. Since there is no relative drift between the two
species, they do not collide, and there is no drift in the direction of E. Of course,
there are collisions due to thermal motions, and this simple result is only an
</p>
<p>approximate one. It comes from our neglect of (a) like-particle collisions, (b) the
</p>
<p>electron mass, and (c) the last two terms in Ohm&rsquo;s law, Eq. (5.90).

<p>5.8 Diffusion of Fully Ionized Plasmas 175</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.9 Solutions of the Diffusion Equation
</p>
<p>Since D&perp; is not a constant in a fully ionized gas, let us define a quantity A which
</p>
<p>is constant:
</p>
<p>A � ηKT=B2 &eth;5:100&THORN;
</p>
<p>We have assumed that KT and B are uniform, and that the dependence of η on
</p>
<p>n through the ln Λ factor can be ignored. For the case Ti&frac14; Te, we then have
</p>
<p>D&perp; &frac14; 2nA &eth;5:101&THORN;
</p>
<p>With Eq. (5.98), the equation of continuity (5.92) can now be written

</p>
<p>This is a nonlinear equation for n, for which there are very few simple solutions.

<p>5.9.1 Time Dependence
</p>
<p>If we separate the variables by letting
</p>
<p>n &frac14; T t&eth; &THORN;S r&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>we can write Eq. (5.102) as

&eth;5:103&THORN;

<p>where�1/τ is the separation constant. The spatial part of this equation is difficult to
solve, but the temporal part is the same equation that we encountered in recombi-
</p>
<p>nation, Eq. (5.41). The solution, therefore, is

</p>
<p>reciprocal decay is what would be expected of a fully ionized plasma diffusing
</p>
<p>classically. The exponential decay of a weakly ionized gas is a distinctly different
</p>
<p>behavior.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.9.2 Time-Independent Solutions
</p>
<p>There is one case in which the diffusion equation can be solved simply. Imagine a
</p>
<p>long plasma column (Fig. 5.19) with a source on the axis which maintains a steady
</p>
<p>state as plasma is lost by radial diffusion and recombination. The density profile
</p>
<p>outside the source region will be determined by the competition between diffusion
</p>
<p>and recombination. The density falloff distance will be short if diffusion is small
</p>
<p>and recombination is large, and will be long in the opposite case. In the region
</p>
<p>outside the source, the equation of continuity is
</p>
<p>�A&nabla;2n2 &frac14; �αn2 &eth;5:105&THORN;
</p>
<p>This equation is linear in n2 and can easily be solved. In cylindrical geometry, the
</p>
<p>solution is a Bessel function. In plane geometry, Eq. (5.105) reads
</p>
<p>d2n2
</p>
<p>dx2
&frac14;
</p>
<p>α
</p>
<p>A

</p>
<p>The scale distance is
</p>
<p>l &frac14; A=α&eth; &THORN;1=2 &eth;5:108&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since A changes with magnetic field while α remains constant, the change of l with
</p>
<p>B constitutes a check of classical diffusion. This experiment was actually tried on a
</p>
<p>Q-machine, which provides a fully ionized plasma. Unfortunately, the presence of
</p>
<p>asymmetric E�B drifts leading to another type of loss&mdash;by convection&mdash;made the
experiment inconclusive.

<p>Finally, we wish to point out a scaling law which is applicable to any fully
</p>
<p>ionized steady state plasma maintained by a constant source Q in a uniform B field.
</p>
<p>The equation of continuity then reads

<p>Since n and B occur only in the combination n/B, the density profile will remain
</p>
<p>unchanged as B is changed, and the density itself will increase linearly with B:
</p>
<p>n / B &eth;5:110&THORN;
</p>
<p>One might have expected the equilibrium density n to scale as B2, since D&perp; / B
�2;
</p>
<p>but one must remember that D&perp; is itself proportional to n.
</p>
<p>5.10 Bohm Diffusion and Neoclassical Diffusion
</p>
<p>Although the theory of diffusion via Coulomb collisions had been known for a long
</p>
<p>time, laboratory verification of the 1/B2 dependence of D&perp; in a fully ionized plasma
</p>
<p>eluded all experimenters until the 1960s. In almost all previous experiments, D&perp;
scaled as B�1, rather than B�2, and the decay of plasmas was found to be exponen-
</p>
<p>tial, rather than reciprocal, with time. Furthermore, the absolute value ofD&perp;was far
</p>
<p>larger than that given by Eq. (5.99). This anomalously poor magnetic confinement
</p>
<p>was first noted in 1946 by Bohm, Burhop, and Massey, who were developing a
</p>
<p>magnetic arc for use in uranium isotope separation. Bohm gave the semiempirical
</p>
<p>formula

</p>
<p>This formula was obeyed in a surprising number of different experiments. Diffusion
</p>
<p>following this law is called Bohm diffusion. Since DB is independent of density, the
</p>
<p>decay is exponential with time. The time constant in a cylindrical column of radius
</p>
<p>R and length L can be estimated as follows:

</p>
<p>The quantity τB is often called the Bohm time.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most extensive series of experiments verifying the Bohm formula
</p>
<p>was done on a half-dozen devices called stellarators at Princeton. A stellarator is a
</p>
<p>toroidal magnetic container with the lines of force twisted so as to average out the
</p>
<p>grad-B and curvature drifts described in Sect. 2.2.3. Figure 5.20 shows a compila-
</p>
<p>tion of data taken over a decade on many different types of discharges in the Model
</p>
<p>C stellarator. The measured values of τ lie near a line representing the Bohm time
</p>
<p>τB. Close adherence to Bohm diffusion would have serious consequences for the
</p>
<p>controlled fusion program. Equation (5.111) shows that DB increases, rather than
</p>
<p>decreases, with temperature, and though it decreases with B, it decreases more
</p>
<p>slowly than expected. In absolute magnitude, DB is also much larger than D&perp;. For
</p>
<p>instance, for a 100-eV plasma in 1-T field, we have

</p>
<p>The disagreement is four orders of magnitude.
</p>
<p>Several explanations have been proposed for Bohm diffusion. First, there is the
</p>
<p>possibility of magnetic field errors. In the complicated geometries used in fusion
</p>
<p>research, it is not always clear that the lines of B either close upon themselves or
</p>
<p>even stay within the chamber. Since the mean free paths are so long, only a slight
</p>
<p>asymmetry in the magnetic coil structure will enable electrons to wander out to the
</p>
<p>walls without making collisions. The ambipolar electric field will then pull the ions
</p>
<p>out. Second, there is the possibility of asymmetric electric fields. These can arise
</p>
<p>from obstacles inserted into the plasma, from asymmetries in the vacuum chamber,
</p>
<p>or from asymmetries in the way the plasma is created or heated. The dc E�B drifts
then need not be parallel to the walls, and ions and electrons can be carried together
</p>
<p>to the walls by E�B convection. The drift patterns, called convective cells, have
been observed. Finally, there is the possibility of oscillating electric fields arising
</p>
<p>from unstable plasma waves. If these fluctuating fields are random, the E�B drifts
constitute a collisionless random-walk process. Even if the oscillating field is a pure
</p>
<p>sine wave, it can lead to enhanced losses because the phase of the E�B drift can be
such that the drift is always outward whenever the fluctuation in density is positive.
</p>
<p>One may regard this situation as a moving convective cell pattern. Fluctuating
</p>
<p>electric fields are often observed when there is anomalous diffusion, but in many
</p>
<p>cases, it can be shown that the fields are not responsible for all of the losses. All
</p>
<p>three anomalous loss mechanisms may be present at the same time in experiments
</p>

<p>The scaling of DB with KTe and B can easily be shown to be the natural one

<p>whenever the losses are caused by E�B drifts, either stationary or oscillating. Let
the escape flux be proportional to the E�B drift velocity:

<p>Recent experiments on toroidal devices have achieved confinement times of
</p>
<p>order 1000τB. This was accomplished by carefully eliminating oscillations and
</p>
<p>asymmetries. However, in toroidal devices, other effects occur which enhance
</p>
<p>collisional diffusion. Figure 5.21 shows a torus with helical lines of force. The
</p>
<p>twist is needed to eliminate the unidirectional grad-B and curvature drifts. As a
</p>
<p>particle follows a B-line, it sees a larger jBj near the inside wall of the torus and a
smaller jBj near the outside wall. Some particles are trapped by the magnetic
mirror effect and do not circulate all the way around the torus. The guiding centers
</p>
<p>of these trapped particles trace out banana-shaped orbits as they make successive
</p>
<p>passes through a given cross section (Fig. 5.21). As a particle makes collisions, it
</p>
<p>becomes trapped and untrapped successively and goes from one banana orbit to
</p>
<p>another. The random-walk step length is therefore the width of the banana orbit
</p>
<p>rather than rL, and the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; diffusion coefficient is increased. This is called
</p>
<p>neoclassical diffusion. The dependence of D&perp; on collision frequency v is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.22. In the region of small v, banana diffusion is larger than classical
</p>
<p>diffusion. In the region of large v, there is classical diffusion, but it is modified
</p>
<p>by currents along B. The theoretical rate for neoclassical diffusion has
been observed experimentally by Ohkawa at La Jolla, CA, and by Chen at
</p>
<p>Princeton, NJ.

</p>
<p>Equilibrium and Stability
</p>
<p>6.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>If we look only at the motions of individual particles, it would be easy to design a
</p>
<p>magnetic field which will confine a collisionless plasma. We need only make sure
</p>
<p>that the lines of force do not hit the vacuum wall and arrange the symmetry of the
</p>
<p>system in such a way that all the particle drifts vE, v&nabla;B, and so forth are parallel to
the walls. From a macroscopic fluid viewpoint, however, it is not easy to see
</p>
<p>whether a plasmawill be confined in a magnetic field designed to contain individual
</p>
<p>particles. No matter how the external fields are arranged, the plasma can generate
</p>
<p>internal fields which affect its motion. For instance, charge bunching can create
</p>
<p>E fields which can cause E�B drifts to the wall. Currents in the plasma can
generate B fields which cause grad-B drifts outward.
</p>
<p>We can arbitrarily divide the problem of confinement into two parts: the problem
</p>
<p>of equilibrium and the problem of stability. A tight-rope walker can easily find an
</p>
<p>equilibrium, but it is not stable unless he holds a drooping rod. The difference
</p>
<p>between equilibrium and stability can also be illustrated by a mechanical analogy.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.1 shows various cases of a marble resting on a hard surface. An equilibrium
</p>
<p>is a state in which all the forces are balanced, so that a time-independent solution is
</p>
<p>possible. The equilibrium is stable or unstable according to whether small perturba-
</p>
<p>tions are damped or amplified. In case (F), the marble is in a stable equilibrium as
</p>
<p>long as it is not pushed too far. Once it is moved beyond a threshold, it is in an
</p>
<p>unstable state. This is called an &ldquo;explosive instability.&rdquo; In case (G), the marble is in an
</p>
<p>unstable state, but it cannot make very large excursions. Such an in stability is not
</p>
<p>very dangerous if the nonlinear limit to the amplitude of the motion is small. The
</p>
<p>situation with a plasma is, of course, much more complicated than what is seen in
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.1; to achieve equilibrium requires balancing the forces on each fluid element.

<p>Of the two problems, equilibrium and stability, the latter is easier to treat. One can
</p>
<p>linearize the equations of motion for small deviations from an equilibrium state. We
</p>
<p>then have linear equations, just as in the case of plasma waves. The equilibrium
</p>
<p>problem, on the other hand, is a nonlinear problem like that of diffusion. In complex
</p>
<p>magnetic geometries, the calculation of equilibria is a tedious process.
</p>
<p>6.2 Hydromagnetic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>Although the general problem of equilibrium is complicated, several physical
</p>
<p>concepts are easily gleaned from the MHD equations. For a steady state with
</p>
<p>&part;/&part;t&frac14; 0 and g&frac14; 0, the plasma must satisfy (cf. Eq. (5.85))

</p>
<p>From the simple equation (6.1), we can already make several observations.
</p>
<p>(a) Equation (6.1) states that there is a balance of forces between the pressure-
</p>
<p>gradient force and the Lorentz force. How does this come about? Consider a
</p>
<p>cylindrical plasma with &nabla;p directed toward the axis (Fig. 6.2). To counteract
</p>
<p>the outward force of expansion, there must be an azimuthal current in the
</p>
<p>direction shown. The magnitude of the required current can be found by taking
</p>
<p>the cross product of Eq. (6.1) with B:
</p>
<p>j&perp; &frac14;
B � &nabla; p
</p>
<p>B2
&frac14; KTi &thorn; KTe&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>B � &nabla;n
</p>
<p>B2
&eth;6:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is just the diamagnetic current found previously in Eq. (3.69)! From a
</p>
<p>single-particle viewpoint, the diamagnetic current arises from the Larmor
</p>
<p>gyration velocities of the particles, which do not average to zero when there
</p>
<p>is a density gradient. From anMHD fluid viewpoint, the diamagnetic current is
</p>
<p>generated by the &nabla;p force across B; the resulting current is just sufficient to
balance the forces on each element of fluid and stop the motion.
</p>
<p>(b) Equation (6.1) obviously tells us that j and B are each perpendicular to &nabla;p.
This is not a trivial statement when one considers that the geometry may be
</p>
<p>very complicated. Imagine a toroidal plasma in which there is a smooth radial
</p>
<p>density gradient so that the surfaces of constant density (actually, constant p)
</p>
<p>are nested tori (Fig. 6.3). Since j and B are perpendicular to &nabla;p, they must lie
on the surfaces of constant p. In general, the lines of force and of current may
</p>
<p>be twisted this way and that, but they must not cross the constant-p surfaces.

<p>(c) Consider the component of Eq. (6.1) along B. It says that
</p>
<p>&part; p=&part;s &frac14; 0 &eth;6:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>where s is the coordinate along a line of force. For constantKT, thismeans that in
</p>
<p>hydromagnetic equilibrium the density is constant along a line of force. At first
</p>
<p>sight, it seems that this conclusion must be in error. For, consider a plasma
</p>
<p>injected into a magnetic mirror (Fig. 6.4). As the plasma streams through,
</p>
<p>following the lines of force, it expands and then contracts; and the density is
</p>
<p>clearly not constant along a line of force. However, this situation does not satisfy
</p>
<p>the conditions of a static equilibrium. The (v &middot;&nabla;)v term, which we neglected
along the way, does not vanish here. We must consider a static plasma with
</p>
<p>v&frac14; 0. In that case, particles are trapped in the mirror, and there are more
particles trapped near the midplane than near the ends because the mirror ratio
</p>
<p>is larger there. This effect just compensates for the larger cross section at the
</p>
<p>midplane, and the net result is that the density is constant along a line of force.

</p>
<p>In many interesting cases, such as a straight cylinder with axial field, the right-hand
</p>
<p>side vanishes; B does not vary along B. In many other cases, the right-hand side is
small. Equation (6.6) then says that
</p>
<p>p&thorn;
B2
</p>
<p>2μ0
&frac14; constant &eth;6:7&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since B2/2 μ0 is the magnetic field pressure, the sum of the particle pressure and the
</p>
<p>magnetic field pressure is a constant. In a plasma with a density gradient (Fig. 6.5),
</p>
<p>the magnetic field must be low where the density is high, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>The decrease of the magnetic field inside the plasma is caused, of course, by the
</p>
<p>diamagnetic current. The size of the diamagnetic effect is indicated by the ratio of
</p>
<p>the two terms in Eq. (6.7). This ratio is usually denoted by β:

</p>
<p>Up to now we have implicitly considered low-β plasmas, in which β is between
</p>
<p>10�3 and 10�6. The diamagnetic effect, therefore, is very small. This is the reason
</p>
<p>we could assume a uniform field B0 in the treatment of plasma waves. If β is low, it
</p>
<p>does not matter whether the denominator of Eq. (6.8) is evaluated with the vacuum
</p>
<p>field or the field in the presence of plasma. If β is high, the local value of B can be
</p>
<p>greatly reduced by the plasma. In that case, it is customary to use the vacuum value
</p>
<p>of B in the definition of β. High-β plasmas are common in space and MHD energy
</p>
<p>conversion research. Fusion reactors will have to have β well in excess of 1 % in
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.5 In a finite-β

<p>order to be economical, since the energy produced is proportional to n2, while the
</p>
<p>cost of the magnetic container increases with some power of B.
</p>
<p>In principle, one can have a β&frac14; 1 plasma in which the diamagnetic current
generates a field exactly equal and opposite to an externally generated uniform
</p>
<p>field. There are then two regions: a region of plasma without field, and a region of
</p>
<p>field without plasma. If the external field lines are straight, this equilibrium would
</p>
<p>likely be unstable, since it is like a blob of jelly held together with stretched rubber
</p>
<p>bands. It remains to be seen whether a β&frac14; 1 plasma of this type can ever be
achieved. In some magnetic configurations, the vacuum field has a null inside the
</p>
<p>plasma; the local value of β would then be infinite there. This happens, for instance,
</p>
<p>when fields are applied only near the surface of a large plasma. It is then customary
</p>
<p>to define β as the ratio of maximum particle pressure to maximum magnetic
</p>
<p>pressure; in this sense, it is not possible for a magnetically confined plasma to
</p>
<p>have β&gt; 1.
</p>
<p>6.4 Diffusion of Magnetic Field into a Plasma
</p>
<p>A problem which often arises in astrophysics is the diffusion of a magnetic field into
</p>
<p>a plasma. If there is a boundary between a region with plasma but no field and a
</p>
<p>region with field but no plasma (Fig. 6.6), the regions will stay separated if the
</p>
<p>plasma has no resistivity, for the same reason that flux cannot penetrate a super-
</p>
<p>conductor. Any emf that the moving lines of force generate will create an infinite
</p>
<p>current, and this is not possible. As the plasma moves around, therefore, it pushes
</p>
<p>the lines of force and can bend and twist them. This may be the reason for the
</p>
<p>filamentary structure of the gas in the Crab nebula. If the resistivity is finite,
</p>
<p>however, the plasma can move through the field and vice versa. This diffusion
</p>
<p>takes a certain amount of time, and if the motions are slow enough, the lines of force
</p>

by a sharp boundary. Currents on the surface exclude the field from the plasma

<p>need not be distorted by the gas motions. The diffusion time is easily calculated

</p>
<p>E&thorn; v� B &frac14; η j &eth;6:10&THORN;
</p>
<p>For simplicity, let us assume that the plasma is at rest and the field lines are moving
</p>
<p>into it. Then v&frac14; 0, and we have
</p>
<p>&part;B=&part;t &frac14; �&nabla; � η j &eth;6:11&THORN;

<p>6.5 Classification of Instabilities
</p>
<p>In the treatment of plasma waves, we assumed an unperturbed state which was one
</p>
<p>of perfect thermodynamic equilibrium: The particles had Maxwellian velocity
</p>
<p>distributions, and the density and magnetic field were uniform. In such a state of
</p>
<p>highest entropy, there is no free energy available to excite waves, and we had to
</p>
<p>consider waves that were excited by external means. We now consider states that
</p>
<p>are not in perfect thermodynamic equilibrium, although they are in equilibrium in
</p>
<p>the sense that all forces are in balance and a time-independent solution is possible.
</p>
<p>The free energy which is available can cause waves to be self-excited; the equilib-
</p>
<p>rium is then an unstable one. An instability is always a motion which decreases the
</p>
<p>free energy and brings the plasma closer to true thermodynamic equilibrium.
</p>
<p>Instabilities may be classified according to the type of free energy available to
</p>
<p>drive them. There are four main categories.
</p>
<p>196 6 Equilibrium and Stability</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.5.1 Streaming instabilities
</p>
<p>In this case, either a beam of energetic particles travels through the plasma, or a
</p>
<p>current is driven through the plasma so that the different species have drifts relative
</p>
<p>to one another. The drift energy is used to excite waves, and oscillation energy is
</p>
<p>gained at the expense of the drift energy in the unperturbed state.
</p>
<p>6.5.2 Rayleigh&ndash;Taylor instabilities
</p>
<p>In this case, the plasma has a density gradient or a sharp boundary, so that it is not
</p>
<p>uniform. In addition, an external, non-electromagnetic force is applied to the
</p>
<p>plasma. It is this force which drives the instability. An analogy is available in
</p>
<p>the example of an inverted glass of water (Fig. 6.7). Although the plane interface
</p>
<p>between the water and air is in a state of equilibrium in that the weight of the water
</p>
<p>is supported by the air pressure, it is an unstable equilibrium. Any ripple in the
</p>
<p>surface will tend to grow at the expense of potential energy in the gravitation al
</p>
<p>field. This happens whenever a heavy fluid is supported by a light fluid, as is well
</p>
<p>known in hydrodynamics.
</p>
<p>6.5.3 Universal instabilities
</p>
<p>Even when there are no obvious driving forces such as an electric or a gravitational
</p>
<p>field, a plasma is not in perfect thermodynamic equilibrium as long as it is confined.
</p>
<p>The plasma pressure tends to make the plasma expand, and the expansion energy
</p>
<p>can drive an instability. This type of free energy is always present in any finite
</p>
<p>plasma, and the resulting waves are called universal instabilities.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.5.4 Kinetic instabilities
</p>
<p>In fluid theory the velocity distributions are assumed to be Maxwellian. If the
</p>
<p>distributions are in fact not Maxwellian, there is a deviation from thermodynamic
</p>
<p>equilibrium; and instabilities can be driven by the anisotropy of the velocity
</p>
<p>distribution. For instance, if T|| and T&perp; are different, an instability called the
</p>
<p>modified Harris instability can arise. In mirror devices, there is a deficit of particles
</p>
<p>with large v||/v&perp; because of the loss cone; this anisotropy gives rise to a &ldquo;loss cone
</p>
<p>instability.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In the succeeding sections, we shall give a simple example of each of these types
</p>
<p>of instabilities. The instabilities driven by anisotropy cannot be described by fluid
</p>
<p>theory and a detailed treatment of them is beyond the scope of this book.
</p>
<p>Not all instabilities are equally dangerous for plasma confinement. A high-
</p>
<p>frequency instability near ωp, for instance, cannot affect the motion of heavy
</p>
<p>ions. Low-frequency instabilities with ω	Ωc, however, can cause anomalous
ambipolar losses via E�B drifts. Instabilities with ω�Ωc not efficiently transport
particles across B but are dangerous in mirror machines, where particles are lost by
diffusion in velocity space into the loss cone.
</p>
<p>6.6 Two-Stream Instability
</p>
<p>As a simple example of a streaming instability, consider a uniform plasma in which
</p>
<p>the ions are stationary and the electrons have a velocity v0 relative to the ions.
That is, the observer is in a frame moving with the &ldquo;stream&rdquo; of ions. Let the plasma
</p>
<p>be cold (KTe&frac14;KTi&frac14; 0), and let there be no magnetic field (B0&frac14; 0). The linearized
equations of motion are then

</p>
<p>The term (ve1 &middot;&nabla;)v0 in Eq. (6.20) has been dropped because we assume v0 to be
uniform. The (v0 &middot;&nabla;)v1 term does not appear in Eq. (6.19) because we have taken
vi0&frac14; 0. We look for electrostatic waves of the form
</p>

<p>Let us see if oscillations with real k are stable or unstable. Upon multiplying
</p>
<p>through by the common denominator, one would obtain a fourth-order equation for

<p>ω. If all the roots ωj are real, each root would indicate a possible oscillation

<p>E1 &frac14; Ee
i kx�ω jt&eth; &THORN;x̂
</p>
<p>If some of the roots are complex, they will occur in complex conjugate pairs. Let

<p>where α and γ are Re(ω) and Im(ω), respectively. The time dependence is now
</p>
<p>given by
</p>
<p>E1 &frac14; Ee
i kx�α jt&eth; &THORN;eγ jtx̂ &eth;6:32&THORN;
</p>
<p>Positive Im(ω) indicates an exponentially growing wave; negative Im(ω) indicates
</p>
<p>a damped wave. Since the roots ωj occur in conjugate pairs, one of these will always
</p>
<p>be unstable unless all the roots are real. The damped roots are not self-excited and
</p>
<p>are not of interest.
</p>
<p>The dispersion relation (Eq. (6.30)) can be analyzed without actually solving the
</p>
<p>fourth-order equation. Let us define
</p>
<p>x � ω=ω p y � kv0=ω p &eth;6:33&THORN;
</p>
<p>Then Eq. (6.30) becomes
</p>
<p>1 &frac14;
m=M
</p>
<p>x2
&thorn;
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>x� y&eth; &THORN;2
� F x; y&eth; &THORN;: &eth;6:34&THORN;
</p>
<p>For any given value of y, we can plot F(x, y) as a function of x. This function will
</p>
<p>have singularities at x&frac14; 0 and x&frac14; y (Fig. 6.8). The intersections of this curve with
the line F(x, y)&frac14; 1 give the values of x satisfying the dispersion relation. In the
example of Fig. 6.8, there are four intersections, so there are four real roots ωj.
</p>
<p>However, if we choose a smaller value of y, the graph would look as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.9. Now there are only two intersections and, therefore, only two real roots.
</p>
<p>The other two roots must be complex, and one of them must correspond to an
</p>
<p>unstable wave. Thus, for sufficiently small kv0, the plasma is unstable. For
</p>
<p>any given v0, the plasma is always unstable to long-wavelength oscillations
</p>
<p>(small k and y). The maximum growth rate predicted by Eq. (6.30) is, for

&eth;6:35&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since a small value of kv0 is required for instability, one can say that for a given k,
</p>
<p>v0 has to be sufficiently small for instability. This does not make much physical
</p>
<p>sense, since v0 is the source of energy driving the instability. The difficulty comes
</p>
<p>from our use of the fluid equations. Any real plasma has a finite temperature, and

<p>thermal effects should be taken into account by a kinetic-theory treatment. A
</p>
<p>phenomenon known as Landau damping (Chap. 7) will then occur for v0≲ vth,
</p>
<p>and no instability is predicted if v0 is too small.
</p>
<p>This &ldquo;Buneman&rdquo; instability, as it is sometimes called, has the following physical
</p>
<p>explanation. The natural frequency of oscillations in the electron fluid is ωp, and the
</p>
<p>natural frequency of oscillations in the ion fluid isΩp&frac14; (m/M )
1/2ωp. Because of the
</p>
<p>Doppler shift of the ωp oscillations in the moving electron fluid, these two frequen-
</p>
<p>cies can coincide in the laboratory frame if kv0 has the proper value. The density
</p>
<p>fluctuations of ions and electrons can then satisfy Poisson&rsquo;s equation. Moreover, the
</p>
<p>electron oscillations can be shown to have negative energy. That is to say, the total
</p>
<p>kinetic energy of the electrons is less when the oscillation is present than when it is
</p>
<p>absent. In the undisturbed beam, the kinetic energy per m3 is
1
</p>
<p>2
mn0v
</p>
<p>2
0. When there is
</p>
<p>an oscillation, the kinetic energy is
1
</p>
<p>2
m n0 &thorn; n1&eth; &THORN; v0 &thorn; v1&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>2
. When this is averaged
</p>
<p>over space, it turns out to be less than
1
</p>
<p>2
mn0v
</p>
<p>2
0 because of the phase relation between
</p>
<p>nl and v1 required by the equation of continuity. Consequently, the electron oscil-
</p>
<p>lations have negative energy, and the ion oscillations have positive energy. Both
</p>
<p>waves can grow together while keeping the total energy of the system constant. An
</p>
<p>instability of this type is used in klystrons to generate microwaves. Velocity
</p>
<p>modulation due to E1 causes the electrons to form bunches. As these bunches
pass through a microwave resonator, they can be made to excite the natural
</p>
<p>modes of the resonator and produce microwave power.

<p>6.7 The &ldquo;Gravitational&rdquo; Instability
</p>
<p>In a plasma, a Rayleigh&ndash;Taylor instability can occur because the magnetic field acts
</p>
<p>as a light fluid supporting a heavy fluid (the plasma). In curved magnetic fields, the
</p>
<p>centrifugal force on the plasma due to particle motion along the curved lines of
</p>
<p>force acts as an equivalent &ldquo;gravitational&rdquo; force. To treat the simplest case, consider
</p>
<p>a plasma boundary lying in the y&ndash;z plane (Fig. 6.10). Let there be a density gradient
</p>

<p>&nabla;n0 in the �x direction and a gravitational field g in the x direction. We may let
KTi&frac14;KTe.&frac14; 0 for simplicity and treat the low-β case, in which B0 is uniform. In the
equilibrium state, the ions obey the equation
</p>
<p>Mn0 v0 � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;v0 &frac14; env0 � B0 &thorn;Mn0g &eth;6:36&THORN;
</p>
<p>If g is a constant, v0will be also; and (v0 &middot;&nabla;)v0 vanishes. Taking the cross product of
Eq. (6.36) with B0, we find, as in Sect. 2.2,

<p>The electrons have an opposite drift which can be neglected in the limit m/M! 0.
There is no diamagnetic drift because KT&frac14; 0, and no E0�B0 drift because
E0&frac14; 0.
</p>
<p>If a ripple should develop in the interface as the result of random thermal
</p>
<p>fluctuations, the drift v0 will cause the ripple to grow (Fig. 6.11). The drift of ions
causes a charge to build up on the sides of the ripple, and an electric field develops
</p>
<p>which changes sign as one goes from crest to trough in the perturbation. As can be
</p>
<p>seen from Fig. 6.11, the E1�B0 drift is always upward in those regions where
the surface has moved upward, and downward where it has moved downward. The
</p>
<p>ripple grows as a result of these properly phased E1�B0 drifts.
To find the growth rate, we can perform the usual linearizedwave analysis forwaves

is merely a

<p>consequence of neglecting v0e. The wave is stationary in the frame in which the

<p>density-weighted average of all the v0&rsquo;s is zero, which in this case is the frame
</p>
<p>moving at 1

v0. The laboratory frame has no particular significance in this case.
</p>
<p>This instability, which has k &perp; B0, is sometimes called a &ldquo;flute&rdquo; instability for
the following reason. In a cylinder, the waves travel in the θ direction if the forces
</p>
<p>are in the r direction. The surfaces of constant density then resemble fluted Greek
</p>
<p>columns (Fig. 6.12).
</p>
<p>6.8 Resistive Drift Waves
</p>
<p>A simple example of a universal instability is the resistive drift wave. In contrast to
</p>
<p>gravitational flute modes, drift waves have a small but finite component of k along
B0. The constant density surfaces. Therefore, resemble flutes with a slight helical
twist (Fig. 6.13). If we enlarge the cross section enclosed by the box in Fig. 6.13 and
</p>
<p>straighten it out into Cartesian geometry it would appear as in Fig. 6.14. The only
</p>
<p>driving force for the instability is the pressure gradient KT &nabla;n0 (we assume
</p>
<p>KT&frac14; constant for simplicity). In this case, the zeroth-order drifts (for E0&frac14; 0) are

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Since drift waves have finite kz, electrons can flow along B0 to establish a
thermodynamic equilibrium among themselves (cf. discussion of Sect. 4.10).
</p>
<p>They will then obey the Boltzmann relation (Sect. 3.5):
</p>
<p>n1=n0 &frac14; eϕ1=KTe &eth;6:58&THORN;
</p>
<p>At point A in Fig. 6.14 the density is larger than in equilibrium, nl is positive, and
</p>
<p>therefore ϕ1 is positive. Similarly, at point B, n1 and ϕ1 are negative. The difference
</p>
<p>in potential means there is an electric field E1 between A and B. Just as in the case of
</p>
<p>the flute instability, E1 causes a drift v1 &frac14; E1 � B0=B
2
0 in the x direction. As the
</p>
<p>wave passes by, traveling in the y direction, an observer at point Awill see n1 and ϕ1
oscillating in time. The drift v1 will also oscillate in time, and in fact it is v1 which
causes the density to oscillate. Since there is a gradient &nabla;n0 in the �x direction, the
drift v1 will bring plasma of different density to a fixed observer A. A drift wave,
therefore, has a motion such that the fluid moves back and forth in the x direction
</p>
<p>although the wave travels in the y direction.
</p>
<p>To be more quantitative, the magnitude of v1x is given by
</p>
<p>v1x &frac14; Ey=B0 &frac14; �ikyϕ1=B0 &eth;6:59&THORN;
</p>
<p>We shall assume v1x does not vary with x and that kz is much less than ky; that is, the
</p>
<p>fluid oscillates incompressibly in the x direction. Consider now the number of
</p>
<p>guiding centers brought into 1 m3 at a fixed point A; it is obviously
</p>
<p>&part;n1=&part;t &frac14; �v1x&part;n0=&part;x &eth;6:60&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is just the equation of continuity for guiding centers, which, of course, do
</p>
<p>not have a fluid drift vD. The term n0 &nabla; &middot; v1 vanishes because of our previous
assumption. The difference between the density of guiding centers and the density
</p>
<p>of particles n1 gives a correction to Eq. (6.60) which is higher order and may be
</p>
<p>neglected here. Using Eqs. (6.59) and (6.58), we can write Eq. (6.60) as
</p>

<p>there is a component of k in the z direction. For reasons not given here, this

<p>To see why drift waves are unstable, one must realize that v1x is not quite Ey/B0 for
</p>
<p>the ions. There are corrections due to the polarization drift, Eq. (2.66), and the
</p>
<p>nonuniform E drift, Eq. (2.59). The result of these drifts is always to make the
potential distribution ϕ1 lag behind the density distribution n1 (Problem 4.1). This
</p>
<p>phase shift causes v1 to be outward where the plasma has already been shifted
outward, and vice versa; hence the perturbation grows. In the absence of the phase
</p>
<p>shift, n1 and ϕ1 would be 90
� out of phase, as shown in Fig. 6.14, and drift waves
</p>
<p>would be purely oscillatory.
</p>
<p>The role of resistivity comes in because the field E1 must not be short-circuited
by electron flow along B0. Electron&ndash;ion collisions, together with a long distance
1
</p>
<p>2
λz between crest and trough of the wave, make it possible to have a resistive
</p>
<p>potential drop and a finite value of E1. The dispersion relation for resistive drift

</p>
<p>This shows that Im(ω) is always positive and is proportional to the resistivity η.
</p>
<p>Drift waves are, therefore, unstable and will eventually occur in any plasma with a
</p>
<p>density gradient. Fortunately, the growth rate is rather small, and there are ways to
</p>
<p>stop it altogether by making B0 nonuniform.
Note that Eq. (6.52) for the flute instability and Eq. (6.64) for the drift instability
</p>
<p>have different structures. In the former, the coefficients are real, and ω is complex
</p>
<p>when the discriminant of the quadratic is negative; this is typical of a reactive
</p>
<p>instability. In the latter, the coefficients are complex, so ω is always complex; this is

<p>6.9 The Weibel Instability1
</p>
<p>As an example of an instability driven by anisotropy of the distribution function, we
</p>
<p>give a physical picture (due to B. D. Fried) of the Weibel instability, in which a
</p>
<p>magnetic perturbation is made to grow. This will also serve as an example of an
</p>
<p>electromagnetic instability. Let the ions be fixed, and let the electrons be hotter in
</p>
<p>the y direction than in the x or z directions. There is then a preponderance of fast
</p>
<p>electrons in the �y directions (Fig. 6.15), but equal numbers flow up and down,
so that there is no net current. Suppose a field B &frac14; Bzẑ cos kx spontaneously arises
from noise. The Lorentz force �ev�B then bends the e1ectron trajectories as
shown by the dashed curves, with the result that downward-moving electrons
</p>
<p>congregate at A and upward-moving ones at B. The resulting current sheets
</p>
<p>j&frac14;�en0ve are phased exactly right to generate a B field of the shape assumed,
and the perturbation grows. Though the general case requires a kinetic treatment,
</p>
<p>the simple case vy&frac14; v0, vx&frac14; vz&frac14; 0 has been solved by Fried from this physical
picture, yielding a growth rate γ�ωpv0/c.

<p>7.1 The Meaning of f(v)
</p>
<p>The fluid theory we have been using so far is the simplest description of a plasma; it
</p>
<p>is indeed fortunate that this approximation is sufficiently accurate to describe the
</p>
<p>majority of observed phenomena. There are some phenomena, however, for which
</p>
<p>a fluid treatment is inadequate. For these, we need to consider the velocity distri-
</p>
<p>bution function f(v) for each species; this treatment is called kinetic theory. In fluid
theory, the dependent variables are functions of only four independent variables: x,
</p>
<p>y, z, and t. This is possible because the velocity distribution of each species is
</p>
<p>assumed to be Maxwellian everywhere and can therefore be uniquely specified by
</p>
<p>only one number, the temperature T. Since collisions can be rare in high-
</p>
<p>temperature plasmas, deviations from thermal equilibrium can be maintained for
</p>
<p>relatively long times. As an example, consider two velocity distributions f1(vx) and
</p>
<p>f2(vx) in a one-dimensional system (Fig. 7.1). These two distributions will have
</p>
<p>entirely different behaviors, but as long as the areas under the curves are the same,
</p>
<p>fluid theory does not distinguish between them.
</p>
<p>The density is a function of four scalar variables: n&frac14; n(r, t). When we
consider velocity distributions, we have seven independent variables: f&frac14; f(r, v, t).
By f(r, v, t), we mean that the number of particles per m3 at position r and time twith
velocity components between vx and vx + dvx, vy and vy+ dvy, and vz and vz+ dvz is

<p>This is just a consequence of the vanishing of the volume in phase space (Fig. 7.2)
</p>
<p>for v&frac14; 0. Sometimes g(v) is carelessly denoted by f(v), as distinct from f(v); but g(v)
is a different function of its argument than f(v) is of its argument. From Eq. (7.18), it
is clear that g(v) has dimensions s/m4.
</p>
<p>It is impossible to draw a picture of f(r, v) at a given time t unless we reduce the
number of dimensions. In a one-dimensional system, f(x, vx) can be depicted as a
</p>
<p>surface (Fig. 7.4). Intersections of that surface with planes x&frac14; constant are the
velocity distributions f(vx). Intersections with planes vx&frac14; constant give density
profiles for particles with a given vx. If all the curves f(vx) happen to have
</p>
<p>the same shape, a curve through the peaks would represent the density profile.
</p>
<p>The dashed curves in Fig. 7.4 are intersections with planes f&frac14; constant; these are
level curves, or curves of constant f. A projection of these curves onto the x� vx

</p>
<p>preliminary idea of how the plasma behaves; an example will be given in the
</p>
<p>next section.
</p>
<p>Another type of contour map can be made for f if we consider f(v) at a given
point in space. For instance, if the motion is two dimensional, the contours of
</p>
<p>f(vx, vy) will be circles if f is isotropic in vx, vy. An anisotropic distribution would
</p>
<p>have elliptical contours (Fig. 7.5). A drifting Maxwellian would have circular
</p>
<p>contours displaced from the origin, and a beam of particles traveling in the
</p>
<p>x direction would show up as a separate spike (Fig. 7.6).

<p>7.2 Equations of Kinetic Theory
</p>
<p>The fundamental equation which f(r, v, t) has to satisfy is the Boltzmann equation:
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;t
&thorn; v � &nabla; f &thorn; F

</p>
<p>c
</p>
<p>&eth;7:19&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here F is the force acting on the particles, and (&part;f/&part;t)c is the time rate of change of
f due to collisions. The symbol &nabla; stands, as usual, for the gradient in (x, y, z) space.
</p>
<p>The symbol &part;/&part;v or &nabla;v stands for the gradient in velocity space:
</p>
<p>&part;
</p>
<p>&part;v
&frac14; x̂ &part;
</p>
<p>&part;vx
&thorn; ŷ &part;
</p>
<p>&part;vy
&thorn; ẑ &part;
</p>
<p>&part;vz
&eth;7:20&THORN;
</p>
<p>The meaning of the Boltzmann equation becomes clear if one remembers that f is a
</p>
<p>function of seven independent variables. The total derivative of f with time is,
</p>
<p>therefore
</p>
<p>d f
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14; &part; f

&eth;7:21&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here, &part;f/&part;t is the explicit dependence on time. The next three terms are just v &middot;&nabla;f.

</p>
<p>the last three terms are recognized as (F/m) &middot; (&part;f/&part;v). As discussed previously in
Sect. 3.3, the total derivative df/dt can be interpreted as the rate of change as seen in

<p>a frame moving with the particles. The difference is that now we must consider the
</p>
<p>particles to be moving in six-dimensional (r, v) space; df/dt is the convective
derivative in phase space. The Boltzmann equation (7.19) simply says that df/dt
</p>
<p>is zero unless there are collisions. That this should be true can be seen from the
</p>
<p>one-dimensional example shown in Fig. 7.8.
</p>
<p>The group of particles in an infinitesimal element dx dvx at A all have velocity vx
and position x. The density of particles in this phase space is just f(x, vx). As time
</p>
<p>passes, these particles will move to a different x as a result of their velocity vx and
</p>
<p>will change their velocity as a result of the forces acting on them. Since the forces
</p>
<p>depend on x and vx only, all the particles at A will be accelerated the same amount.
</p>
<p>After a time t, all the particles will arrive at B in phase space. Since all the particles
</p>
<p>moved together, the density at B will be the same as at A. If there are collisions,
</p>
<p>however, the particles can be scattered; and f can be changed by the term (&part;f/&part;t)c.
</p>
<p>In a sufficiently hot plasma, collisions can be neglected. If, furthermore, the
</p>
<p>force F is entirely electromagnetic, Eq. (7.19) takes the special form
</p>
<p>&part; f
</p>
<p>&part;t
&thorn; v � &nabla; f &thorn; q
</p>
<p>m
E&thorn;v� B&eth; &THORN; � &part; f

&frac14; 0 &eth;7:23&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is called the Vlasov equation. Because of its comparative simplicity, this is the
</p>
<p>equation most commonly studied in kinetic theory. When there are collisions with
</p>
<p>neutral atoms, the collision term in Eq. (7.19) can be approximated by
</p>
<p>&part; f

</p>
<p>This is called the Fokker&ndash;Planck equation; it takes into account binary Coulomb
</p>
<p>collisions only. Here, Δv is the change of velocity in a collision, and Eq. (7.25) is a
shorthand way of writing a rather complicated expression.
</p>
<p>The fact that df/dt is constant in the absence of collisions means that particles
</p>
<p>follow the contours of constant f as they move around in phase space. As an
</p>
<p>example of how these contours can be used, consider the beam-plasma instability
</p>
<p>of Sect. 6.6. In the unperturbed plasma, the electrons all have velocity v0, and the
</p>
<p>contour of constant f is a straight line (Fig. 7.9). The function f(x, vx) is a wall rising
</p>
<p>out of the plane of the paper at vx&frac14; v0. The electrons move along the trajectory
shown. When a wave develops, the electric field E1 causes electrons to suffer
changes in vx as they stream along. The trajectory then develops a sinusoidal ripple
</p>
<p>(Fig. 7.10). This ripple travels at the phase velocity, not the particle velocity.
</p>
<p>Particles stay on the curve as they move relative to the wave. If E1 becomes very
</p>
<p>large as the wave grows, and if there are a few collisions, some electrons will be
</p>
<p>trapped in the electrostatic potential of the wave. In coordinate space, the wave
</p>
<p>potential appears as in Fig. 7.11. In phase space, f(x, vx) will have peaks wherever
</p>
<p>there is a potential trough (Fig. 7.12). Since the contours of f are also electron
</p>
<p>trajectories, one sees that some electrons move in closed orbits in phase space; these
</p>
<p>are just the trapped electrons.
</p>
<p>Electron trapping is a nonlinear phenomenon which cannot be treated by
</p>
<p>straightforward solution of the Vlasov equation. However, electron trajectories
</p>
<p>can be followed on a computer, and the results are often presented in the form
</p>
<p>of a plot like Fig. 7.12. An example of a numerical result is shown in Fig. 7.13.

<p>Fig. 7.9 Representation in one-dimensional phase space of a beam of electrons all with the same

<p>7.3 Derivation of the Fluid Equations
</p>
<p>The fluid equations we have been using are simply moments of the Boltzmann
</p>
<p>equation. The lowest moment is obtained by integrating Eq. (7.19) with
</p>
<p>F specialized to the Lorentz force:

<p>The first term gives

<p>&eth;
</p>
<p>f dv &frac14; &part;n
&part;t
</p>
<p>&eth;7:27&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since v is an independent variable and therefore is not affected by the operator &nabla;,
the second term gives
</p>
<p>&eth;
</p>
<p>v � &nabla; f dv&frac14;&nabla; �
&eth;
</p>
<p>v f dv &frac14; &nabla; � nv&eth; &THORN; � &nabla; � nu&eth; &THORN; &eth;7:28&THORN;
</p>
<p>where the average velocity u is the fluid velocity by definition. The E term vanishes
for the following reason:
</p>
<p>&eth;
</p>
<p>E � &part; f
&part;v
</p>
<p>dv &frac14;

<p>&eth;
</p>
<p>S1
</p>
<p>fE � dS &frac14; 0 &eth;7:29&THORN;
</p>
<p>The perfect divergence is integrated to give the value of f E on the surface at v&frac14;1.
This vanishes if f! 0 faster than v�2 as v!1, as is necessary for any distribution
with finite energy. The v�B term can be written as follows:
</p>
<p>&eth;
</p>
<p>v� B&eth; &THORN; � &part; f
&part;v
</p>
<p>dv&frac14;

<p>f
&part;
</p>
<p>&part;v
� v� B&eth; &THORN;dv &frac14; 0 &eth;7:30&THORN;
</p>
<p>The first integral can again be converted to a surface integral. For a Maxwellian,
</p>
<p>f falls faster than any power of v as v!1, and the integral therefore vanishes. The
second integral vanishes because v�B is perpendicular to &part;/&part;v. Finally, the fourth
term in Eq. (7.26) vanishes because collisions cannot change the total number of
</p>
<p>particles (recombination is not considered here). Equations (7.27)&ndash;(7.30) then yield
</p>
<p>the equation of continuity:

<p>The next moment of the Boltzmann equation is obtained by multiplying Eq. (7.19)

<p>The right-hand side is the change of momentum due to collisions and will give the

<p>The third integral in Eq. (7.32) can be written

<p>v E&thorn; v� B&eth; &THORN; � &part; f

</p>
<p>vdv
</p>
<p>&eth;7:34&THORN;
</p>
<p>The first two integrals on the right-hand side vanish for the same reasons as before,
</p>
<p>and &part;v/&part;v is just the identity tensor I. We therefore have
</p>
<p>q
</p>
<p>&eth;

<p>v E&thorn; v� B&eth; &THORN; � &part; f

<p>E&thorn; v� B&eth; &THORN; f dv &frac14; �qn E&thorn; u� B&eth; &THORN; &eth;7:35&THORN;
</p>
<p>Finally, to evaluate the second integral in Eq. (7.32), we first make use of the fact
</p>
<p>that v is an independent variable not related to &nabla; and write
</p>
<p>&eth;
</p>
<p>v v � &nabla;&eth; &THORN; f dv &frac14;
&eth;
</p>
<p>&nabla; � fvv&eth; &THORN;dv &frac14; &nabla; �
&eth;
</p>
<p>fvvdv &eth;7:36&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since the average of a quantity is 1/n times its weighted integral over v, we have
</p>
<p>&nabla; �
&eth;
</p>
<p>fvvdv &frac14; &nabla; � nvv &eth;7:37&THORN;
</p>
<p>Now we may separate v into the average (fluid) velocity u and a thermal velocityw:
</p>
<p>v &frac14; u&thorn; w &eth;7:38&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since u is already an average, we have
</p>
<p>&nabla; � nvv&eth; &THORN; &frac14; &nabla; � nuu&eth; &THORN; &thorn; &nabla; � nww&eth; &THORN; &thorn; 2&nabla; � nuw&eth; &THORN; &eth;7:39&THORN;
</p>
<p>7.3 Derivation of the Fluid Equations 223</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The average w is obviously zero. The quantity mnww is precisely what is meant by
the stress tensor P:
</p>
<p>P � mnww &eth;7:40&THORN;
</p>
<p>The remaining term in Eq. (7.39) can be written
</p>
<p>&nabla; � nuu&eth; &THORN; &frac14; u&nabla; � nu&eth; &THORN; &thorn; n u � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;u &eth;7:41&THORN;
</p>
<p>Collecting our results from Eqs. (7.33), (7.35), (7.40), and (7.41), we can write
</p>
<p>Eq. (7.32) as
</p>
<p>m
&part;
</p>
<p>&part;t
nu&eth; &THORN; &thorn; mu&nabla; � nu&eth; &THORN; &thorn; mn u � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;u&thorn; &nabla; � P� qn E&thorn; u� B&eth; &THORN; &frac14; Pi j &eth;7:42&THORN;
</p>
<p>The first term in Eq. (7.42) represents ionization drag, since u is small when an ion
is first created. Combining the first two terms in Eq. (7.42) with the help of
</p>
<p>Eq. (7.31), we finally obtain the fluid equation of motion:
</p>
<p>mn
&part;u
</p>
<p>&part;t
&thorn; u � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;u
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>&frac14; qn E&thorn;u� B&eth; &THORN; � &nabla; � P&thorn;Pi j &eth;7:43&THORN;
</p>
<p>This equation, an extension of Eq. (3.44), describes the flow of momentum. To treat
</p>
<p>the flow of energy, we may take the next moment of Boltzmann equation by
</p>
<p>multiplying by 1
2
mvv and integrating. We would then obtain the heat flow equation,
</p>
<p>in which the coefficient of thermal conductivity κ would arise in the same manner
</p>
<p>as did the stress tensor P. The equation of state p/ ργ is a simple form of the heat
flow equation for κ&frac14; 0.
</p>
<p>7.4 Plasma Oscillations and Landau Damping
</p>
<p>As an elementary illustration of the use of the Vlasov equation, we shall derive the
</p>
<p>dispersion relation for electron plasma oscillations, which we treated from the fluid
</p>
<p>point of view in Sect. 4.3. This derivation will require a knowledge of contour
</p>
<p>integration. Those not familiar with this may skip to Sect. 7.5. A simpler but longer
</p>
<p>derivation not using the theory of complex variables appears in Sect. 7.6.
</p>
<p>In zeroth order, we assume a uniform plasma with a distribution f0(v), and we let
B0&frac14;E0&frac14; 0. In first order, we denote the perturbation in f(r, v, t) by f1(r, v, t):
</p>
<p>f r; v; t&eth; &THORN; &frac14; f 0 v&eth; &THORN; &thorn; f 1 r; v; t&eth; &THORN; &eth;7:44&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since v is now an independent variable and is not to be linearized, the first-order
Vlasov equation for electrons is

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Since we are dealing with a one-dimensional problem we may drop the subscript x,
</p>
<p>being careful not to confuse v (which is really vx) with the total velocity v used
</p>
<p>earlier:
</p>
<p>1 &frac14;
ω2p

<p>�1
</p>
<p>&part; f̂ 0=&part;v
</p>
<p>v� ω=k&eth; &THORN; dv &eth;7:54&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here, f̂ 0 is understood to be a one-dimensional distribution function, the integra-
</p>
<p>tions over vy and vz having been made. Equation (7.54) holds for any equilibrium
</p>
<p>distribution f̂ 0 v&eth; &THORN;; in particular, if f̂ 0 is Maxwellian, Eq. (7.52) is to be used for it.
The integral in Eq. (7.54) is not straightforward to evaluate because of the
</p>
<p>singularity at v&frac14;ω/k. One might think that the singularity would be of no concern,
because in practice ω is almost never real; waves are usually slightly damped by
</p>
<p>collisions or are amplified by some instability mechanism. Since the velocity v is a
</p>
<p>real quantity, the denominator in Eq. (7.54) never vanishes. Landau was the first to
</p>
<p>treat this equation properly. He found that even though the singularity lies off the
</p>
<p>path of integration, its presence introduces an important modification to the plasma
</p>
<p>wave dispersion relation&mdash;an effect not predicted by the fluid theory.
</p>
<p>Consider an initial value problem in which the plasma is given a sinusoidal
</p>
<p>perturbation, and therefore k is real. If the perturbation grows or decays, ω will be
</p>
<p>complex. The integral in Eq. (7.54) must be treated as a contour integral in the
</p>
<p>complex v plane. Possible contours are shown in Fig. 7.14 for (a) an unstable wave,
</p>
<p>with Im(ω)&gt; 0, and (b) a damped wave, with Im(ω)&lt; 0. Normally, one would
evaluate the line integral along the real v axis by the residue theorem:
</p>
<p>&eth;
</p>
<p>C1
</p>
<p>Gdv&thorn;
&eth;
</p>
<p>C2
</p>

</p>
<p>226 7 Kinetic Theory</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>where G is the integrand, C1 is the path along the real axis, C2 is the semicircle at
</p>
<p>infinity, and R(ω/k) is the residue at ω/k. This works if the integral over C2 vanishes.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this does not happen for a Maxwellian distribution, which contains
</p>
<p>the factor
</p>
<p>exp �v2=v2th
� �
</p>
<p>This factor becomes large for v!�i1, and the contribution from C2 cannot be
neglected. Landau showed that when the problem is properly treated as an initial
</p>
<p>value problem the correct contour to use is the curve C1 passing below the
</p>
<p>singularity. This integral must in general be evaluated numerically, and Fried and
</p>
<p>Conte have provided tables for the case when f̂ 0 is a Maxwellian.
</p>
<p>Although an exact analysis of this problem is complicated, we can obtain an
</p>
<p>approximate dispersion relation for the case of large phase velocity and weak
</p>
<p>damping. In this case, the pole at ω/k lies near the real v axis (Fig. 7.15). The
</p>
<p>contour prescribed by Landau is then a straight line along the Re(v) axis with a
</p>
<p>small semicircle around the pole. In going around the pole, one obtains 2πi times
</p>
<p>half the residue there. Then Eq. (7.54) becomes

<p>where P stands for the Cauchy principal value. To evaluate this, we integrate along
</p>
<p>the real v axis but stop just before encountering the pole. If the phase velocity
</p>
<p>vϕ&frac14;ω/k is sufficiently large, as we assume, there will not be much contribution
from the neglected part of the contour, since both f̂ 0 and &part; f̂ 0=&part;v are very small
there (Fig. 7.16). The integral in Eq. (7.56) can be evaluated by integration by parts:

<p>term, it will be sufficiently accurate to neglect the thermal correction to the real

<p>part of ω and let ω2 	 ω2p. From Eqs. (7.57) and (7.60), we see that the principal

<p>Since Im(ω) is negative, there is a collisionless damping of plasma waves; this
</p>
<p>is called Landau damping. As is evident from Eq. (7.70), this damping is
</p>
<p>extremely small for small kλD, but becomes important for kλD&frac14;O(1). This effect
is connected with f1, the distortion of the distribution function caused by
</p>
<p>the wave.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.5 The Meaning of Landau Damping
</p>
<p>The theoretical discovery of wave damping without energy dissipation by collisions
</p>
<p>is perhaps the most astounding result of plasma physics research. That this is a
</p>
<p>real effect has been demonstrated in the laboratory. Although a simple physical
</p>
<p>explanation for this damping is now available, it is a triumph of applied mathematics
</p>
<p>that this unexpected effect was first discovered purely mathematically in the course
</p>
<p>of a careful analysis of a contour integral. Landau damping is a characteristic
</p>
<p>of collisionless plasmas, but it may also have application in other fields. For instance,
</p>
<p>in the kinetic treatment of galaxy formation, stars can be considered as atoms
</p>
<p>of a plasma interacting via gravitational rather than electromagnetic forces.
</p>
<p>Instabilities of the gas of stars can cause spiral arms to form, but this process is
</p>
<p>limited by Landau damping.
</p>
<p>To see what is responsible for Landau damping, we first notice that Im(ω) arises
</p>
<p>from the pole at v&frac14; vϕ. Consequently, the effect is connected with those particles in
the distribution that have a velocity nearly equal to the phase velocity&mdash;the &ldquo;res-
</p>
<p>onant particles.&rdquo; These particles travel along with the wave and do not see a rapidly
</p>
<p>fluctuating electric field: They can, therefore, exchange energy with the wave
</p>
<p>effectively. The easiest way to understand this exchange of energy is to picture a
</p>
<p>surfer trying to catch an ocean wave (Fig. 7.17). (Warning: this picture is only for
</p>
<p>directing our thinking along the right lines; it does not correctly explain Eq. (7.70).)
</p>
<p>If the surfboard is not moving, it merely bobs up and down as the wave goes by and
</p>
<p>does not gain any energy on the average. Similarly, a boat propelled much faster
</p>
<p>than the wave cannot exchange much energy with the wave. However, if the
</p>
<p>surfboard has almost the same velocity as the wave, it can be caught and pushed
</p>
<p>along by the wave; this is, after all, the main purpose of the exercise. In that case,
</p>
<p>the surfboard gains energy, and therefore the wave must lose energy and is damped.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the surfboard should be moving slightly faster than the wave, it
</p>
<p>would push on the wave as it moves uphill; then the wave could gain energy. In a
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.17 Customary physical picture of Landau damping
</p>
<p>230 7 Kinetic Theory</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>plasma, there are electrons both faster and slower than the wave. A Maxwellian
</p>
<p>distribution, however, has more slow electrons than fast ones (Fig. 7.18). Conse-
</p>
<p>quently, there are more particles taking energy from the wave than vice versa, and
</p>
<p>the wave is damped. As particles with v	 vϕ are trapped in the wave, f(v) is
flattened near the phase velocity. This distortion is f1(v) which we calculated. As
</p>
<p>seen in Fig. 7.18, the perturbed distribution function contains the same number of
</p>
<p>particles but has gained total energy (at the expense of the wave).
</p>
<p>From this discussion, one can surmise that if f0(v) contained more fast particles
</p>
<p>than slow particles, a wave can be excited. Indeed, from Eq. (7.67), it is apparent
</p>
<p>that Im(ω) is positive if&part; f̂ 0=&part;v is positive at v&frac14; vϕ. Such a distribution is shown in
Fig. 7.19. Waves with vϕ in the region of positive slope will be unstable, gaining
</p>
<p>energy at the expense of the particles. This is just the finite-temperature analogy of
</p>
<p>the two-stream instability. When there are two cold (KT&frac14; 0) electron streams in
motion, f0(v) consists of two δ-functions. This is clearly unstable because &part;f0/&part;v is
</p>
<p>infinite; and, indeed, we found the instability from fluid theory. When the streams
</p>
<p>have finite temperature, kinetic theory tells us that the relative densities and
</p>
<p>temperatures of the two streams must be such as to have a region of positive &part;f0/
</p>
<p>&part;v between them; more precisely, the total distribution function must have a
</p>
<p>minimum for instability.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The physical picture of a surfer catching waves is very appealing, but it is
</p>
<p>not precise enough to give us a real understanding of Landau damping. There
</p>
<p>are actually two kinds of Landau damping: linear Landau damping, and
</p>
<p>nonlinear Landau damping. Both kinds are independent of dissipative collisional
</p>
<p>mechanisms. If a particle is caught in the potential well of a wave, the
</p>
<p>phenomenon is called &ldquo;trapping.&rdquo; As in the case of the surfer, particles can
</p>
<p>indeed gain or lose energy in trapping. However, trapping does not lie within
</p>
<p>the purview of the linear theory. That this is true can be seen from the equation
</p>
<p>of motion
</p>
<p>md2x=dt2 &frac14; qE x&eth; &THORN; &eth;7:71&THORN;
</p>
<p>If one evaluates E(x) by inserting the exact value of x, the equation would be
</p>
<p>nonlinear, since E(x) is something like sin kx. What is done in linear theory is to use
</p>
<p>for x the unperturbed orbit; i.e., x&frac14; x0 + v0t. Then Eq. (7.71) is linear. This approx-
imation, however, is no longer valid when a particle is trapped. When it encounters
</p>
<p>a potential hill large enough to reflect it, its velocity and position are, of course,
</p>
<p>greatly affected by the wave and are not close to their unperturbed values. In fluid
</p>
<p>theory, the equation of motion is
</p>
<p>m
&part;v
</p>
<p>&part;t
&thorn; v � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;v
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>&frac14; qE x&eth; &THORN; &eth;7:72&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here, E(x) is to be evaluated in the laboratory frame, which is easy; but to make up
for it, there is the (v &middot;&nabla;)v term. The neglect of (v1 &middot;&nabla;)v1 in linear theory amounts to
the same thing as using unperturbed orbits. In kinetic theory, the nonlinear term that
</p>
<p>is neglected is, from Eq. (7.45),
</p>
<p>q
</p>
<p>m
E1
</p>
<p>&part; f 1
&part;v
</p>
<p>&eth;7:73&THORN;
</p>
<p>When particles are trapped, they reverse their direction of travel relative to the
</p>
<p>wave, so the distribution function f(v) is greatly disturbed near v&frac14;ω/k. This means
that &part;f1/&part;v is comparable to &part;f0/&part;v, and the term (7.73) is not negligible. Hence,
</p>
<p>trapping is not in the linear theory.
</p>
<p>When a wave grows to a large amplitude, collisionless damping with trapping
</p>
<p>does occur. One then finds that the wave does not decay monotonically; rather, the
</p>
<p>amplitude fluctuates during the decay as the trapped particles bounce back and forth
</p>
<p>in the potential wells. This is nonlinear Landau damping. Since the result of
</p>
<p>Eq. (7.67) was derived from a linear theory, it must arise from a different physical
</p>
<p>effect. The question is: Can untrapped electrons moving close to the phase velocity
</p>
<p>of the wave exchange energy with the wave? Before giving the answer, let us
</p>
<p>examine the energy of such electrons.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.5.1 The Kinetic Energy of a Beam of Electrons
</p>
<p>We may divide the electron distribution f0(v) into a large number of monoenergetic
</p>
<p>beams (Fig. 7.20). Consider one of these beams: It has unperturbed velocity u and
</p>
<p>density nu. The velocity umay lie near vϕ, so that this beam may consist of resonant
</p>
<p>electrons. We now turn on a plasma oscillation E1(x, t) and consider the kinetic
</p>
<p>energy of the beam as it moves through the crests and troughs of the wave.
</p>
<p>The wave is caused by a self-consistent motion of all the beams together. If nu is
</p>
<p>small enough (the number of beams large enough), the beam being examined
</p>
<p>has a negligible effect on the wave and may be considered as moving in a given
</p>
<p>field E(x, t). Let

<p>Figure 7.21 shows what Eqs. (7.77) and (7.79) mean. The first two curves show
</p>
<p>one wavelength of E and of the potential�eϕ seen by the beam electrons. The third
curve is a plot of Eq. (7.77) for the case ω� ku&lt; 0, or u&gt; vϕ. This is easily
understood: When the electron a has climbed the potential hill, its velocity is
</p>

</p>
<p>234 7 Kinetic Theory</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>small, and vice versa. The fourth curve is v1 for the case u&lt; vϕ and it is seen that the
sign is reversed. This is because the electron b, moving to the left in the frame of the
</p>
<p>wave, is decelerated going up to the top of the potential barrier; but since it is
</p>
<p>moving the opposite way, its velocity v1 in the positive x direction is maximum
</p>
<p>there. The moving potential hill accelerates electron b to the right, so by the time it
</p>
<p>reaches the top, it has the maximum v1. The final curve on Fig. 7.21 shows the
</p>
<p>density n1, as given by Eq. (7.79). This does not change sign with u� vϕ, because in
the frame of the wave, both electron a and electron b are slowest at the top of the
</p>
<p>potential hill, and therefore the density is highest there. The point is that the relative
</p>
<p>phase between n1 and v1 changes sign with u� vϕ.
We may now compute the kinetic energy Wk of the beam:

<p>This result shows that hΔWki depends on the frame of the observer and that it
does not change secularly with time. Consider the picture of a frictionless block
</p>
<p>7.5 The Meaning of Landau Damping 235</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>sliding over a washboard-like surface (Fig. 7.22). In the frame of the washboard,
</p>
<p>ΔWk is proportional to�(ku)�2, as seen by takingω&frac14; 0 in Eq. (7.84). It is intuitively
clear that (1) hΔWki is negative, since the block spends more time at the peaks than at
the valleys, and (2) the block does not gain or lose energy on the average, once the
</p>
<p>oscillation is started. Now if one goes into a frame in which the washboard is moving
</p>
<p>with a steady velocityω/k (a velocity unaffected by themotion of the block, since we
</p>
<p>have assumed that nu is negligibly small compared with the density of the whole
</p>
<p>plasma), it is still true that the block does not gain or lose energy on the average, once
</p>
<p>the oscillation is started. But Eq. (7.84) tells us that hΔWki depends on the velocity
ω/k, and hence on the frame of the observer. In particular, it shows that a beam has
</p>
<p>less energy in the presence of the wave than in its absence if ω� ku&lt; 0 or u&gt; vϕ;
and it has more energy ifω� ku&gt; 0 or u&lt; vϕ. The reason for this can be traced back
to the phase relation between n1 and v1. As Fig. 7.23 shows, Wk is a parabolic
</p>
<p>function of v. As v oscillates between u� |v1| and u+ |v1|, Wk will attain an average
value larger than the equilibrium value Wk0, provided that the particle spends an
</p>
<p>equal amount of time in each half of the oscillation. This effect is the meaning of the
</p>
<p>first term in Eq. (7.81), which is positive definite. The second term in that equation is
</p>
<p>a correction due to the fact that the particle does not distribute its time equally. In
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.21, one sees that both electron a and electron b spend more time at the top of

<p>the potential hill than at the bottom, but electron a reaches that point after a period of
</p>
<p>deceleration, so that v1 is negative there, while electron b reaches that point after a
</p>
<p>period of acceleration (to the right), so that v1 is positive there. This effect causes
</p>
<p>hΔWki to change sign at u&frac14; vϕ.
</p>
<p>7.5.2 The Effect of Initial Conditions
</p>
<p>The result we have just derived, however, still has nothing to do with linear Landau
</p>
<p>damping. Damping requires a continuous increase of Wk at the expense of wave
</p>
<p>energy, but we have found that hΔWki for untrapped particles is constant in time. If
neither the untrapped particles nor particle trapping is responsible for linear Landau
</p>
<p>damping, what is? The answer can be gleaned from the following observation: If
</p>
<p>hΔWki is positive, say, there must have been a time when it was increasing. Indeed,
there are particles in the original distribution which have velocities so close to vϕ
that at time t they have not yet gone a half-wavelength relative to the wave. For
</p>
<p>these particles, one cannot take the average hΔWki. These particles can absorb
energy from the wave and are properly called the &ldquo;resonant&rdquo; particles. As time goes
</p>
<p>on, the number of resonant electrons decreases, since an increasing number will
</p>
<p>have shifted more than 1
2
λ from their original positions. The damping rate, however,
</p>
<p>can stay constant, since the amplitude is now smaller, and it takes fewer electrons to
</p>
<p>maintain a constant damping rate.
</p>
<p>The effect of the initial conditions is most easily seen from a phase-space
</p>
<p>diagram (Fig. 7.24). Here, we have drawn the phase-space trajectories of electrons,
</p>
<p>and also the electrostatic potential �eϕ1 which they see. We have assumed that this
electrostatic wave exists at t&frac14; 0, and that the distribution f0(v), shown plotted in a
plane perpendicular to the paper, is uniform in space and monotonically decreasing
</p>
<p>with |v| at that time. For clarity, the size of the wave has been greatly exaggerated.
</p>
<p>Of course, the existence of a wave implies the existence of an f1(v) at t&frac14; 0.
However, the damping caused by this is a higher-order effect neglected in the linear
</p>
<p>theory. Now let us go to the wave frame, so that the pattern of Fig. 7.24 does not
</p>
<p>move, and consider the motion of the electrons. Electrons initially at A start out at
</p>
<p>the top of the potential hill and move to the right, since they have v&gt; vϕ. Electrons
initially at B move to the left, since they have v&lt; vϕ. Those at C and D start at the
potential trough and move to the right and left, respectively. Electrons starting on
</p>
<p>the closed contours E have insufficient energy to go over the potential hill and are
</p>
<p>trapped. In the limit of small initial wave amplitude, the population of the trapped
</p>
<p>electrons can be made arbitrarily small. After some time t, short enough that none of
</p>
<p>the electrons at A, B, C or D has gone more than half a wavelength, the electrons
</p>
<p>will have moved to the positions marked by open circles. It is seen that the electrons
</p>
<p>at A and D have gained energy, while those at B and C have lost energy. Now, if
</p>
<p>f0(v) was initially uniform in space, there were originally more electrons at A than at
</p>
<p>C, and more at D than at B. Therefore, there is a net gain of energy by the electrons,
</p>
<p>and hence a net loss of wave energy. This is linear Landau damping, and it is

<p>critically dependent on the assumed initial conditions. After a long time, the
</p>
<p>electrons are so smeared out in phase that the initial distribution is forgotten, and
</p>
<p>there is no further average energy gain, as we found in the previous section. In this
</p>
<p>picture, both the electrons with v&gt; vϕ and those with v&lt; vϕ when averaged over a
wavelength, gain energy at the expense of the wave. This apparent contradiction
</p>
<p>with the idea developed in the picture of the surfer will be resolved shortly.
</p>
<p>7.6 A Physical Derivation of Landau Damping
</p>
<p>We are now in a position to derive the Landau damping rate without recourse to
</p>
<p>contour integration. As before, we divide the plasma up into beams of velocity
</p>
<p>u and density nu, and examine their motion in a wave
</p>
<p>E &frac14; E1 sin kx� ωt&eth; &THORN; &eth;7:85&THORN;
</p>

entire pattern moves to the right. The arrows refer to the direction of electron motion relative to the
</p>
<p>wave pattern. The equilibrium distribution f0(v) is plotted in a plane perpendicular to the paper.
</p>
<p>238 7 Kinetic Theory</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>From Eq. (7.77), the velocity of each beam is
</p>
<p>v1 &frac14; �
eE1
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>cos kx� ωt&eth; &THORN;
ω� ku &eth;7:86&THORN;
</p>
<p>This solution satisfies the equation of motion (7.76), but it does not satisfy the initial
</p>
<p>condition v1&frac14; 0 at t&frac14; 0. It is clear that this initial condition must be imposed;
otherwise, v1 would be very large in the vicinity of u&frac14;ω/k, and the plasma would
be in a specially prepared state initially. We can fix up Eq. (7.86) to satisfy the
</p>
<p>initial condition by adding an arbitrary function of kx� kut. The composite solution
would still satisfy Eq. (7.76) because the operator on the left-hand side of
</p>
<p>Eq. (7.76), when applied to f(kx� kut), gives zero. Obviously, to get v1&frac14; 0 at
t&frac14; 0, the function f(kx� kut) must be taken to be �cos(kx� kut). Thus we have,
instead of Eq. (7.86),
</p>
<p>v1 &frac14;
�eE1
m
</p>
<p>cos kx� ωt&eth; &THORN; � cos kx� kut&eth; &THORN;
ω� ku &eth;7:87&THORN;
</p>
<p>Next, we must solve the equation of continuity (7.78) for n1, again subject to the
</p>
<p>initial condition n1&frac14; 0 at t&frac14; 0. Since we are now much cleverer than before, we
may try a Solution of the form
</p>
<p>n1 &frac14; n1 cos kx� ωt&eth; &THORN; � cos kx� kut&eth; &THORN;&frac12; � &eth;7:88&THORN;
</p>
<p>Inserting this into Eq. (7.78) and using Eq. (7.87) for v1, we find
</p>
<p>n1 sin kx� ωt&eth; &THORN; &frac14; �nu
eE1k
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>sin kx� ωt&eth; &THORN; � sin kx� kut&eth; &THORN;
ω� ku&eth; &THORN;2
</p>
<p>&eth;7:89&THORN;
</p>
<p>Apparently, we were not clever enough, since the sin(kx�ωt) factor does not
cancel. To get a term of the form sin(kx� kut), which came from the added term
in v1, we can add a term of the form At sin(kx� kut) to n1. This term obviously
vanishes at t&frac14; 0, and it will give the sin(kx� kut) term when the operator on the
left-hand side of Eq. (7.78) operates on the t factor. When the operator operates on
</p>
<p>the sin(kx� kut) factor, it yields zero. The coefficient A must be proportional to
(ω� ku)�1 in order to match the same factor in &part;v1/&part;x. Thus we take
</p>
<p>n1 &frac14; �nu
eE1k
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>ω� ku&eth; &THORN;2
</p>
<p>� cos kx� ωt&eth; &THORN; � cos kx� kut&eth; &THORN; � ω� ku&eth; &THORN;t sin kx� kut&eth; &THORN;&frac12; �
&eth;7:90&THORN;
</p>
<p>This clearly vanishes at t&frac14; 0, and one can easily verify that it satisfies Eq. (7.78).
These expressions for v1 and n1 allow us now to calculate the work done by the
</p>
<p>wave on each beam. The force acting on a unit volume of each beam is

<p>7.6.1 The Resonant Particles
</p>

<p>contribute to linear Landau damping. Figure 7.25 gives a plot of the factor multi-
</p>
<p>plying f̂
0
</p>
<p>0 u&eth; &THORN; in the integrand of Eq. (7.107). We see that the largest contribution
comes from particles with jω� kuj&lt; π/t, or jv� vϕjt&lt; π/k&frac14; λ/2; i.e., those particles
in the initial distribution that have not yet traveled a half-wavelength relative to the
</p>
<p>wave. The width of the central peak narrows with time, as expected. The subsidiary
</p>
<p>242 7 Kinetic Theory</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>peaks in the &ldquo;diffraction pattern&rdquo; of Fig. 7.25 come from particles that have traveled
</p>
<p>into neighboring half-wavelengths of the wave potential. These particles rapidly
</p>
<p>become spread out in phase, so that they contribute little on the average; the initial
</p>
<p>distribution is forgotten. Note that the width of the central peak is independent of the
</p>
<p>initial amplitude of the wave; hence, the resonant particles may include both trapped
</p>
<p>and untrapped particles. This phenomenon is unrelated to particle trapping.
</p>
<p>7.6.2 Two Paradoxes Resolved
</p>
<p>Figure 7.25 shows that the integrand in Eq. (7.107) is an even function of ω� ku, so
that particles going both faster than the wave and slower than the wave add to
</p>
<p>Landau damping. This is the physical picture we found in Fig. 7.24. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, the slope of the curve of Fig. 7.25, which represents the factor in the integrand
</p>
<p>of Eq. (7.106), is an odd function of ω� ku; and one would infer from this that
particles traveling faster than the wave give energy to it, while those traveling
</p>
<p>slower than the wave take energy from it. The two descriptions differ by an
</p>
<p>integration by parts. Both descriptions are correct; which one is to be chosen
</p>
<p>depends on whether one wishes to have f̂ 0 u&eth; &THORN; or f̂
0
</p>
<p>0 u&eth; &THORN; in the integrand.
A second paradox concerns the question of Galilean invariance. If we take the
</p>
<p>view that damping requires there be fewer particles traveling faster than the wave
</p>
<p>than slower, there is no problem as long as one is in the frame in which the plasma is
</p>
<p>at rest. However, if one goes into another frame moving with a velocity
</p>
<p>V (Fig. 7.26), there would appear to be more particles faster than the wave than
</p>
<p>slower, and one would expect the wave to grow instead of decay. This paradox is
</p>

Landau damping

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>removed by reinserting the second term in Eq. (7.100), which we neglected. As
</p>
<p>shown in Sect. 7.5.1, this term can make hΔWki negative. Indeed, in the frame
shown in Fig. 7.26, the second term in Eq. (7.100) is not negligible, hΔWki is
negative, and the wave appears to have negative energy (that is, there is more
</p>
<p>energy in the quiescent, drifting Maxwellian distribution than in the presence of an
</p>
<p>oscillation). The wave &ldquo;grows,&rdquo; but adding energy to a negative energy wave makes
</p>
<p>its amplitude decrease.
</p>
<p>7.7 BGK and Van Kampen Modes
</p>
<p>We have seen that Landau damping is directly connected to the requirement that
</p>
<p>f0(v) be initially uniform in space. On the other hand, one can generate undamped
</p>
<p>electron waves if f(v, t&frac14; 0) is made to be constant along the particle trajectories
initially. It is easy to see from Fig. 7.24 that the particles will neither gain nor lose
</p>
<p>energy, on the average, if the plasma is initially prepared so that the density is
</p>
<p>constant along each trajectory. Such a wave is called a BGKmode, since it was I. B.
</p>
<p>Bernstein, J. M. Greene, and M. D. Kruskal who first showed that undamped waves
</p>
<p>of arbitrary ω, k, amplitude, and waveform were possible. The crucial parameter to
</p>
<p>adjust in tailoring f(v, t&frac14; 0) to form a BGK mode is the relative number of trapped
and untrapped particles. If we take the small-amplitude limit of a BGK mode, we
</p>
<p>obtain what is called a Van Kampen mode. In this limit, only the particles
</p>
<p>with v&frac14; vϕ are trapped. We can change the number of trapped particles by adding
to f(v, t&frac14; 0) a term proportional to δ(v� vϕ). Examination of Fig. 7.24 will show
that adding particles along the line v&frac14; vϕ will not cause damping&mdash;at a later time,
there are just as many particles gaining energy as losing energy. In fact, by choosing
</p>
<p>distributions with δ-functions at other values of vϕ one can generate undamped Van
</p>
<p>Kampen modes of arbitrary vϕ. Such singular initial conditions are, however, not

</p>
<p>244 7 Kinetic Theory</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>physical. To get a smoothly varying f(v, t&frac14; 0), one must sum over Van Kampen
modes with a distribution of vϕ&rsquo;s. Although each mode is undamped, the total
</p>
<p>perturbation will show Landau damping because the various modes get out of phase
</p>
<p>with one another.
</p>
<p>7.8 Experimental Verification
</p>
<p>Although Landau&rsquo;s derivation of collisionless damping was short and neat, it was
</p>
<p>not clear that it concerned a physically observable phenomenon until J. M. Dawson
</p>
<p>gave the longer, intuitive derivation which was paraphrased in Sect. 7.6. Even then,
</p>
<p>there were doubts that the proper conditions could be established in the laboratory.
</p>
<p>These doubts were removed in 1965 by an experiment by Malmberg and Wharton.
</p>
<p>They used probes to excite and detect plasma waves along a collisionless plasma
</p>
<p>column. The phase and amplitude of the waves as a function of distance were
</p>
<p>obtained by interferometry. A tracing of the spatial variation of the damped wave is
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 7.27. Since in the experiment ωwas real but kwas complex, the result
</p>
<p>we obtained in Eq. (7.70) cannot be compared with the data. Instead, a calculation
</p>
<p>of Im(k)/Re(k) for real ω has to be made. This ratio also contains the factor exp
</p>
<p>�v2ϕ=v2th
� �
</p>
<p>which is proportional to the number of resonant electrons in a Maxwel-
</p>
<p>lian distribution. Consequently, the logarithm of Im(k)/Re(k) should be proportional
</p>
<p>to (vϕ/vth)

</p>
<p>and the theoretical curve.
</p>
<p>A similar experiment by Derfler and Simonen was done in plane geometry, so
</p>
<p>that the results for Re(ω) can be compared with Eq. (7.64). Figure 7.29 shows their
</p>
<p>measurements of Re(k) and Im(k) at different frequencies. The dashed curve

<p>Problems
</p>
<p>7.1 Plasma waves are generated in a plasma with n&frac14; 1017 m�3 and KTe&frac14; 10 eV.
If k&frac14; 104 m�1, calculate the approximate Landau damping rate jIm(ω/ωp)j.
</p>
<p>7.2 An electron plasma wave with 1-cm wavelength is excited in a 10-eV plasma
</p>
<p>with n&frac14; 1015 m�3. The excitation is then removed, and the wave Landau
damps away. How long does it take for the amplitude to fall by a factor of e?
</p>
<p>7.3 An infinite, uniform plasma with fixed ions has an electron distribution function
</p>
<p>composed of (1) a Maxwellian distribution of &ldquo;plasma&rdquo; electrons with density
</p>
<p>np and temperature Tp at rest in the laboratory, and (2) a Maxwellian distribu-
</p>
<p>tion of &ldquo;beam&rdquo; electrons with density nb and temperature Tb centered at v&frac14;Vx̂
(Fig. P7.3). If nb is infinitesimally small, plasma oscillations traveling in the
</p>
<p>x direction are Landau-damped. If nb is large, there will be a two-stream
</p>
<p>instability. The critical nb at which instability sets in can be found by setting
</p>
<p>the slope of the total distribution function equal to zero. To keep the algebra
</p>
<p>simple, we can find an approximate answer as follows.

<p>7.9 Ion Landau Damping
</p>
<p>Electrons are not the only possible resonant particles. If a wave has a slow enough
</p>
<p>phase velocity to match the thermal velocity of ions, ion Landau damping can
</p>
<p>occur. The ion acoustic wave, for instance, is greatly affected by Landau damping.

<p>&eth;7:112&THORN;
</p>
<p>If Te
 Ti, the phase velocity lies in the region where f0i(v) has a negative slope, as
shown in Fig. 7.30a. Consequently, ion waves are heavily Landau-damped if
</p>
<p>Te
 Ti. Ion waves are observable only if Te� Ti [Fig. 7.30b], so that the phase
velocity lies far in the tail of the ion velocity distribution. A clever way to introduce
</p>
<p>Landau damping in a controlled manner was employed by Alexeff, Jones, and
</p>
<p>Montgomery. A weakly damped ion wave was created in a heavy-ion plasma (such
</p>
<p>as xenon) with Te� Ti. A small amount of a light atom (helium) was then added.
Since the helium had about the same temperature as the xenon but had much
</p>
<p>smaller mass, its distribution function was much broader, as shown by the dashed
</p>
<p>curve in Fig. 7.30b. The resonant helium ions then caused the wave to damp. Ion
</p>
<p>acoustic waves generated in instabilities are often not seen because of the severe
</p>
<p>damping by light-ion impurities.
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.30 Explanation of Landau damping of ion acoustic waves. For Te	 Ti, the phase velocity
lies well within the ion distribution; for Te� Ti, there are very few ions at the phase velocity.
Addition of a light ion species (dashed curve) increases Landau damping

one having the smallest jImωj. Damping in space is usually treated by taking ω real
and k complex. Again we get a series of roots k with Im k&gt; 0, representing spatial
damping. However, the dominant root does not correspond to the same value of ζi

</p>
<p>viscosity) can damp ion acoustic waves, but we know that sound waves in air can
</p>
<p>propagate well in spite of the dominance of collisions. Actually, collisions spoil the

<p>particle resonances that cause Landau damping, and one finds that the total damping
</p>
<p>is less than the Landau damping unless the collision rate is extremely large. In

</p>
<p>(A&frac14; 131) plasma with Te&frac14; 1 eV and Ti&frac14; 0.1 eV. If the exciter is turned off,
how long does it take for the waves to Landau damp to 1/e of their initial

<p>7.8. Ion waves with λ&frac14; 5 cm are excited in a singly ionized argon plasma with
ne&frac14; 1016 m�3, Te&frac14; 2 eV, Ti&frac14; 0.2 eV; and the Landau damping rate is
measured. A hydrogen impurity of density nH&frac14; αne is then introduced.
Calculate the value of α that will double the damping rate.

<p>7.9. In laser fusion experiments one often encounters a hot electron distribution
</p>
<p>with density nh and temperature Th in addition to the usual population with ne,
</p>
<p>Te. The hot electrons can change the damping of ion waves and hence affect
</p>
<p>such processes as stimulated Brillouin scattering. Assume Z&frac14; 1 ions with ni
and Ti and define θe&frac14; Te/Ti, θh&frac14; Th/Ti, α&frac14; nh/ni, 1� α&frac14; ne/ni, ε&frac14;m/M and
k2Di &frac14; nie2=ε0KTi.

<p>(b) Show that electron Landau damping is not appreciably increased by nh if
</p>
<p>Th� Te.
(c) Show that ion Landau damping is decreased by nh, and that the effect
</p>
<p>can be expressed as an increase in the effective temperature ratio Te/Ti.
</p>
<p>7.10. The dispersion relation for electron plasma waves propagating along B0ẑ can
be obtained from the dielectric tensor ε (Appendix B) and Poisson&rsquo;s equation,

<p>7.10 Kinetic Effects in a Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>When either the dc magnetic field B0 or the oscillating magnetic field B1 is finite,
the v�B term in the Vlasov equation (7.23) for a collisionless plasma must be
included. The linearized equation (7.45) is then replaced by

</p>
<p>Resonant particles moving along B0 still cause Landau damping if ω/k&rsquo; vth, but
two new kinetic effects now appear which are connected with the velocity compo-
</p>
<p>nent v&perp; perpendicular to B0. One of these is cyclotron damping, which will be
discussed later; the other is the generation of cyclotron harmonics, leading to the
</p>
<p>possibility of the oscillations commonly called Bernstein waves.
</p>
<p>Harmonics of the cyclotron frequency are generated when the particles&rsquo; circular
</p>
<p>Larmor orbits are distorted by the wave fields E1 and B1. These finite-rL effects are
</p>
<p>neglected in ordinary fluid theory but can be taken into account to order k2r2L by
</p>
<p>including the viscosity π. A kinetic treatment can be accurate even for k2r2L &frac14; O 1&eth; &THORN;.
To understand how harmonics arise, consider the motion of a particle in an electric

<p>E&frac14;Exei kx�ωt&eth; &THORN;x̂ &eth;7:136&THORN;

<p>We can approximate kx by substituting the undisturbed orbit x&frac14; rL sinωct

n&frac14; 0,�1,�2, . . .; that is, when the field E(x, t) resonates with any harmonic of ωc.
In the fluid limit krL! 0, Jn(krL) can be approximated by (krL/2)n/n!, which
approaches 0 for all n except n&frac14; 0. For n&frac14; 0, the coefficient in Eq. (7.142)
becomes ω2c � ω2

, which is the fluid result [cf. Eq. (4.57)] containing only

<p>the fundamental cyclotron frequency.
</p>
<p>7.10.1 The Hot Plasma Dielectric Tensor
</p>
<p>After Fourier analysis of f1(r, v, t) in space and time, Eq. (7.135) can be solved for a
Maxwellian distribution f0(v), and the resulting expressions f1(k, v, ω) can be used
to calculate the density and current of each species. The result is usually expressed
</p>
<p>in the form of an equivalent dielectric tensor e, such that the displacement vector
</p>
<p>D&frac14; e &middot;E can be used in the Maxwell&rsquo;s equations &nabla; &middot;D&frac14; 0 and &nabla;�B&frac14; μ0D to
calculate dispersion relations for various waves (see Appendix B). The algebra is
</p>
<p>horrendous and therefore omitted. We quote only a restricted result valid for
</p>
<p>nonrelativistic plasmas with isotropic pressure (T&perp;&frac14; T||) and no zero-order drifts
v0j; these restrictions are easily removed, but the general formulas are too cluttered
for our purposes. We further assume k&frac14;kxx̂&thorn;kzẑ , with ẑ being the direction of B0;

<p>7.10.2 Cyclotron Damping
</p>
<p>When a particle moving along B0 in a wave with finite kz has the right velocity, it
sees a Doppler-shifted frequency ω� kzvz equal to� nωc and is therefore subject to
continuous acceleration by the electric field E&perp; of the wave. Those particles with
the &ldquo;right&rdquo; phase relative to E&perp; will gain energy; those with the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; phase will
lose energy. Since the energy change is the force times the distance, the faster
</p>
<p>accelerated particles gain more energy per unit time than what the slower deceler-
</p>
<p>ated particles lose. There is, therefore, a net gain of energy by the particles, on the
</p>
<p>average, at the expense of the wave energy; and the wave is damped. This
</p>
<p>mechanism differs from Landau damping because the energy gained is in the
</p>
<p>direction perpendicular to B0, and hence perpendicular to the velocity component
that brings the particle into resonance. The resonance is not easily destroyed by
</p>
<p>phenomena such as trapping. Furthermore, the mere existence of resonant particles
</p>
<p>suffices to cause damping; one does not need a negative slope f
0
0(vz), as in Landau
</p>
<p>damping.
</p>
<p>To clarify the physical mechanism of cyclotron damping, consider a wave with
</p>
<p>k&frac14;kxx̂&thorn;kzẑ with kz positive. The wave electric field E&perp; can be decomposed into
left- and right-hand circularly polarized components, as shown in Fig. 7.32. For the
</p>
<p>left-hand component, the vector E&perp; at positions A, B, and C along the z axis appears
as shown in Fig. 7.32a. Since the wave propagates in the&thorn;ẑ direction, a stationary
electron would sample the vectors at C, B, and A in succession and therefore would
</p>
<p>see a left-rotating E-field. It would not be accelerated because its Larmor gyration is
in the right-hand (clockwise) direction. However, if the electron were moving faster
</p>
<p>than the wave in the ẑ direction, it would see the vectors at A, B, and C in that order
and hence would be resonantly accelerated if its velocity satisfied the condition
</p>
<p>ω� kzvz&frac14;�ωc. The right-hand component of E would appear as shown in
Fig. 7.32b. Now an electron would see a clockwise rotating E-field if it moved

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>more slowly than the wave, so that the vectors at C, B, and A were sampled in
</p>
<p>succession. This electron would be accelerated if it met the condition
</p>
<p>ω� kzvz&frac14; +ωc. A plane or elliptically polarized wave would, therefore, be cyclo-
tron damped by electrons moving in either direction in the wave frame.
</p>
<p>7.10.3 Bernstein Waves
</p>
<p>Electrostatic waves propagating at right angles to B0 at harmonics of the cyclotron
frequency are called Bernstein waves. The dispersion relation can be found by
</p>
<p>using the dielectric elements given in Eq. (7.143) in Poisson&rsquo;s equation &nabla; &middot; e &middot;E&frac14; 0.
If we assume electrostatic perturbations such that E1&frac14;�&nabla;ϕ1, and consider waves
of the form ϕ1&frac14;ϕ1 exp i(k &middot; r�ωt), Poisson&rsquo;s equation can be written

so that kv&frac14; 0. We next Substitute for exx, exz, and ezz from Eq. (7.143) and express

treated in Eq. (7.153), the distinction between the two cases will be clearer if we go

the Boltzmann relation (3.73).

approaches ωl. For finite b, one of the terms in the sum can balance the electron

<p>term if ω&rsquo; nΩc, so there are roots near the ion cyclotron harmonics. The dispersion
curves ω/Ωc vs. k&perp;rLi resemble the electron curves in Fig. 7.34. The lowest two

<p>The lower branches of the Bernstein wave dispersion relation exhibit the back-

that the group velocity is opposite in direction to the phase velocity. That backward
</p>
<p>waves actually exist in the laboratory has been verified not only by ω

<p>Nonlinear Effects
</p>
<p>8.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Up to this point, we have limited our attention almost exclusively to linear
</p>
<p>phenomena; that is, to phenomena describable by equations in which the dependent
</p>
<p>variable occurs to no higher than the first power. The entire treatment of waves in
</p>
<p>Chap. 4, for instance, depended on the process of linearization, in which higher-
</p>
<p>order terms were regarded as small and were neglected. This procedure enabled us
</p>
<p>to consider only one Fourier component at a time, with the secure feeling that any
</p>
<p>nonsinusoidal wave can be handled simply by adding up the appropriate distribu-
</p>
<p>tion of Fourier components. This works as long as the wave amplitude is small
</p>
<p>enough that the linear equations are valid.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in many experiments waves are no longer describable by the
</p>
<p>linear theory by the time they are observed. Consider, for instance, the case of drift
</p>
<p>waves. Because they are unstable, drift waves would, according to linear theory,
</p>
<p>increase their amplitude exponentially. This period of growth is not normally
</p>
<p>observed&mdash;since one usually does not know when to start looking&mdash;but instead
</p>
<p>one observes the waves only after they have grown to a large, steady amplitude. The
</p>
<p>fact that the waves are no longer growing means that the linear theory is no longer
</p>
<p>valid, and some nonlinear effect is limiting the amplitude. Theoretical explanation
</p>
<p>of this elementary observation has proved to be a surprisingly difficult problem,
</p>
<p>since the observed amplitude at saturation is rather small.
</p>
<p>A wave can undergo a number of changes when its amplitude gets large. It can
</p>
<p>change its shape&mdash;say, from a sine wave to a lopsided triangular waveform. This is
</p>
<p>the same as saying that Fourier components at other frequencies (or wave numbers)
</p>
<p>are generated. Ultimately, the wave can &ldquo;break,&rdquo; like ocean waves on a beach,
</p>
<p>converting the wave energy into thermal energy of the particles. A large wave can

<p>trap particles in its potential troughs, thus changing the properties of the medium in
</p>
<p>which it propagates. We have already encountered this effect in discussing
</p>
<p>nonlinear Landau damping. If a plasma is so strongly excited that a continuous
</p>
<p>spectrum of frequencies is present, it is in a state of turbulence. This state must be
</p>
<p>described statistically, as in the case of ordinary fluid hydrodynamics. An important
</p>
<p>consequence of plasma turbulence is anomalous resistivity, in which electrons are
</p>
<p>slowed down by collisions with random electric field fluctuations, rather than with
</p>
<p>ions. This effect is used for ohmic heating of a plasma (Sect. 5.6.3) to temperatures
</p>
<p>so high that ordinary resistivity is insufficient.
</p>
<p>Nonlinear phenomena can be grouped into three broad categories:
</p>
<p>1. Basically nonlinearizable problems. Diffusion in a fully ionized gas, for
</p>
<p>instance, is intrinsically a nonlinear problem (Sect. 5.8) because the diffusion
</p>
<p>coefficient varies with density. In Sect. 6.1, we have seen that problems of
</p>
<p>hydromagnetic equilibrium are nonlinear. In Sect. 8.2, we shall give a further
</p>
<p>example&mdash;the important subject of plasma sheaths.
</p>
<p>2. Wave&ndash;particle interactions. Particle trapping (Sect. 7.5) is an example of this
</p>
<p>and can lead to nonlinear damping. A classic example is the quasilinear effect, in
</p>
<p>which the equilibrium of the plasma is changed by the waves. Consider the case
</p>
<p>of a plasma with an electron beam (Fig. 8.1). Since the distribution function has a
</p>
<p>region where df0/dv is positive, the system has inverse Landau damping, and
</p>
<p>plasma oscillations with vϕ in the positive-slope region are unstable (Eq. (7.67)).
</p>
<p>The resonant electrons are the first to be affected by wave&ndash;particle interactions,
</p>
<p>and their distribution function will be changed by the wave electric field. The
</p>
<p>waves are stabilized when fe(v) is flattened by the waves, as shown by the dashed
</p>
<p>line in Fig. 8.1, so that the new equilibrium distribution no longer has a positive
</p>
<p>slope. This is a typical quasilinear effect. Another example of wave&ndash;particle
</p>
<p>interactions, that of plasma wave echoes, will be given in Sect. 8.6.
</p>
<p>3. Wave&ndash;wave interactions. Waves can interact with each other even in the fluid
</p>
<p>description, in which individual particle effects are neglected. A single wave can
</p>
<p>decay by first generating harmonics of its fundamental frequency. These har-
</p>
<p>monics can then interact with each other and with the primary wave to form
</p>
<p>other waves at the beat frequencies. The beat waves in turn can grow so large
</p>
<p>that they can interact and form many more beat frequencies, until the spectrum

<p>becomes continuous. It is interesting to discuss the direction of energy flow in
</p>
<p>a turbulent spectrum. In fluid dynamics, long-wavelength modes decay into
</p>
<p>short-wavelength modes, because the large eddies contain more energy and
</p>
<p>can decay only by splitting into small eddies, which are each less energetic.
</p>
<p>The smallest eddies then convert their kinetic motion into heat by viscous
</p>
<p>damping. In a plasma, usually the opposite occurs. Short-wavelength modes
</p>
<p>tend to coalesce into long-wavelength modes, which are less energetic. This is
</p>
<p>because the electric field energy E2/2 is of order k2ϕ2/2, so that if eϕ is fixed
</p>
<p>(usually by KTe), the small-k, long-λ modes have less energy. As a consequence,
</p>
<p>energy will be transferred to small k by instabilities at large k, and some
</p>
<p>mechanism must be found to dissipate the energy. No such problem exists at
</p>
<p>large k, where Landau damping can occur. For motions along B0, nonlinear
</p>
<p>&ldquo;modulational&rdquo; instabilities could cause the energy at small k to be coupled to
</p>
<p>ions and to heat them. For motions perpendicular to B0, the largest eddies will
</p>
<p>have wavelengths of the order of the plasma radius and could cause plasma loss
</p>
<p>to the walls by convection.
</p>
<p>Although problems still remain to be solved in the linear theory of waves and
</p>
<p>instabilities, the mainstream of plasma research has turned to the much less well
</p>
<p>understood area of nonlinear phenomena. The examples in the following sections will
</p>
<p>give an idea of some of the effects that have been studied in theory and in experiment.

</p>
<p>8.2.1 The Necessity for Sheaths
</p>
<p>In all practical plasma devices, the plasma is contained in a vacuum chamber of
</p>
<p>finite size. What happens to the plasma at the wall? For simplicity, let us confine our
</p>
<p>attention to a one-dimensional model with no magnetic field (Fig. 8.2). Suppose
</p>
<p>there is no appreciable electric field inside the plasma; we can then let the potential
</p>
<p>ϕ be zero there. When ions and electrons hit the wall, they recombine and are lost.
</p>
<p>Since electrons have much higher thermal velocities than ions, they are lost faster
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.2 The plasma
potential ϕ forms sheaths
</p>
<p>near the walls so that
</p>
<p>electrons are reflected. The
</p>
<p>Coulomb barrier eϕw
adjusts itself so that equal
</p>
<p>numbers of ions and
</p>
<p>electrons reach the walls per
</p>
<p>second
</p>
<p>8.2 Sheaths 269</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and leave the plasma with a net positive charge. The plasma must then have a
</p>
<p>potential positive with respect to the wall; i.e., the wall potential ϕw is negative.
</p>
<p>This potential cannot be distributed over the entire plasma, since Debye shielding
</p>
<p>(Sect. 1.4) will confine the potential variation to a layer of the order of several
</p>
<p>Debye lengths in thickness. This layer, which must exist on all cold walls with
</p>
<p>which the plasma is in contact, is called a sheath. The function of a sheath is to form
</p>
<p>a potential barrier so that the more mobile species, usually electrons, is confined
</p>
<p>electrostatically. The height of the barrier adjusts itself so that the flux of electrons
</p>
<p>that have enough energy to go over the barrier to the wall is just equal to the flux of
</p>
<p>ions reaching the wall.
</p>
<p>8.2.2 The Planar Sheath Equation
</p>
<p>In Sect. 1.4, we linearized Poisson&rsquo;s equation to derive the Debye length. To
</p>
<p>examine the exact behavior of ϕ (x) in the sheath, we must treat the nonlinear
</p>
<p>problem; we shall find that there is not always a solution. Figure 8.3 shows the
</p>
<p>situation near one of the walls. At the plane x&frac14; 0, ions are imagined to enter the
sheath region from the main plasma with a drift velocity u0. This drift is needed to
</p>
<p>account for the loss of ions to the wall from the region in which they were created
</p>
<p>by ionization. For simplicity, we assume Ti&frac14; 0, so that all ions have the velocity u0
at x&frac14; 0. We consider the steady state problem in a collisionless sheath region. The
potential ϕ is assumed to decrease monotonically with x. Actually, ϕ could have
</p>
<p>spatial oscillations, and then there would be trapped particles in the steady state.
</p>
<p>This does not happen in practice because dissipative processes tend to destroy any
</p>
<p>such highly organized state.
</p>

a planar sheath. Cold ions
</p>

</p>
<p>&eth;8:11&THORN;
</p>
<p>This inequality is known as the Bohm sheath criterion. It says that ions must enter
</p>
<p>the sheath region with a velocity greater than the acoustic velocity vs. To give the
</p>
<p>ions this directed velocity u0, there must be a finite electric field in the plasma. Our
</p>
<p>assumption that χ0 &frac14; 0 at ξ&frac14; 0 is therefore only an approximate one, made possible
by the fact that the scale of the sheath region is usually much smaller than the scale
</p>
<p>of the main plasma region in which the ions are accelerated. The value of u0 is
</p>
<p>somewhat arbitrary, depending on where we choose to put the boundary x&frac14; 0
between the plasma and the sheath. Of course, the ion flux n0u0 is fixed by the
</p>
<p>ion production rate, so if u0 is varied, the value of n0 at x&frac14; 0 will vary inversely
with u0. If the ions have finite temperature, the critical drift velocity u0 will be
</p>
<p>somewhat lower.
</p>
<p>The physical reason for the Bohm criterion is easily seen from a plot of the ion
</p>
<p>and electron densities vs. χ (Fig. 8.4). The electron density ne falls exponentially
</p>
<p>with χ according to the Boltzmann relation. The ion density also falls, since the ions
</p>
<p>are accelerated by the sheath potential. If the ions start with a large energy, ni(χ)
</p>
<p>falls slowly, since the sheath field causes a relatively minor change in the ions&rsquo;
</p>
<p>velocity. If the ions start with a small energy, ni(χ) falls fast, and can go below the ne
curve. In that case, ne� ni is positive near χ&frac14; 0; and Eq. (8.6) tells us that ϕ(x) must
curve upward, in contradiction to the requirement that the sheath must repel
</p>
<p>272 8 Nonlinear Effects</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>electrons. In order for this not to happen, the slope of ni( χ) at χ&frac14; 0 must be
smaller (in absolute value) than that of ne( χ); this condition is identical with the
</p>
<p>condition M2 &gt; 1.
</p>
<p>8.2.4 The Child&ndash;Langmuir Law
</p>
<p>Since ne( χ) falls exponentially with χ, the electron density can be neglected in the
</p>
<p>region of large χ next to the wall (or any negative electrode). Poisson&rsquo;s equation is

</p>
<p>The potential variation in a plasma&ndash;wall system can be divided into three parts.
</p>
<p>Nearest the wall is an electron-free region whose thickness d is given by Eq. (8.18).
</p>
<p>Here J is determined by the ion production rate, and ϕw is determined by the equality
</p>
<p>of electron and ion fluxes. Next comes a region in which ne is appreciable; as shown
</p>
<p>in Sect. 1.4, this region has the scale of the Debye length. Finally, there is a region
</p>
<p>with much larger scale length, the &ldquo;presheath,&rdquo; in which the ions are accelerated to
</p>
<p>the required velocity u0 by a potential drop |ϕ|�&frac12;KTe/e. Depending on the exper-
iment, the scale of the presheath may be set by the plasma radius, the collision mean
</p>
<p>free path, or the ionization mechanism. The potential distribution, of course, varies
</p>
<p>smoothly; the division into three regions is made only for convenience and is made
</p>
<p>possible by the disparity in scale lengths. In the early days of gas discharges, sheaths
</p>
<p>could be observed as dark layers where no electrons were present to excite atoms to
</p>
<p>emission. Subsequently, the potential variation has been measured by the electro-
</p>
<p>static deflection of a thin electron beam shot parallel to a wall.
</p>
<p>Recent theories of discharges in finite cylinders show that the sheaths on the
</p>
<p>endplates play an essential rôle in moving plasma created at the radial edge towards
</p>
<p>the axis, so that the final density profile is peaked at the center. It has also been
</p>
<p>shown that the density profile in such a plasma, including the presheath, tends to fall
</p>
<p>into a universal shape independent of pressure and discharge diameter.
</p>
<p>8.2.5 Electrostatic Probes
</p>
<p>The sheath criterion, Eq. (8.11), can be used to estimate the flux of ions to a
</p>
<p>negatively biased probe in a plasma. If the probe has a surface area A, and if the
</p>
<p>ions entering the sheath have a drift velocity u0� (KTe/M )1/2, then the ion current
collected is

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>I &frac14; nseA KTe=M&eth; &THORN;1=2 &eth;8:19&THORN;
</p>
<p>The electron current can be neglected if the probe is sufficiently negative (several
</p>
<p>times KTe) relative to the plasma to repel all but the tail of the Maxwellian electron
</p>
<p>distribution. The density ns is the plasma density at the edge of the sheath. Let us
</p>
<p>define the sheath edge to be the place where u0 is exactly (KTe/M )
1/2. To accelerate
</p>
<p>ions to this velocity requires a presheath potential |ϕ|�&frac12;KTe/e, so that the sheath
edge has a potential
</p>
<p>ϕs &rsquo; �

</p>
<p>2
KTe=e &eth;8:20&THORN;
</p>

<p>determines ns:
</p>
<p>ns &frac14; n0eeϕs=kTe &frac14; n0e�1=2 &frac14; 0:61n0 &eth;8:21&THORN;
</p>
<p>For our purposes it is accurate enough to replace 0.61 with a round number like 1/2;
</p>
<p>thus, the &ldquo;saturation ion current&rdquo; to a negative probe is approximately
</p>
<p>IB &frac14; 1
2
n0eA KTe=M&eth; &THORN;1=2 &eth;8:22&THORN;
</p>
<p>IB, sometimes called the &ldquo;Bohm current,&rdquo; gives the plasma density easily, once the
</p>
<p>temperature is known.
</p>
<p>If the Debye length λD, and hence the sheath thickness, is very small compared to
</p>
<p>the probe dimensions, the area of the sheath edge is effectively the same as the area
</p>
<p>A of the probe surface, regardless of its shape. At low densities, however, λD can
</p>
<p>become large, so that some ions entering the sheath can orbit the probe and miss
</p>
<p>it. Calculations of orbits for various probe shapes were first made by I. Langmuir
</p>
<p>and L. Tonks&mdash;hence the name &ldquo;Langmuir probe&rdquo; ascribed to this method of
</p>
<p>measurement. Though tedious, these calculations can give accurate determinations
</p>
<p>of plasma density because an arbitrary definition of sheath edge does not have to be
</p>
<p>made. By varying the probe voltage, the electron distribution is sampled, and the
</p>
<p>current&ndash;voltage curve of a Langmuir probe can also yield the electron temperature,
</p>
<p>if the electrons are Maxwellian, or their velocity distribution if they are not. The
</p>
<p>Langmuir probe is the first plasma diagnostic and is still the simplest and the most
</p>
<p>localized measurement device. Material electrodes can be inserted only in
</p>
<p>low-density, cool plasmas. Nonetheless, these include most non-fusion laboratory
</p>
<p>plasmas, and an extensive literature exists on probe theory. The problem with using
</p>
<p>a large probe, to which Eq. (8.22) applies, is that it collects from an ill-defined
</p>
<p>sheath edge that surrounds it, and it may also disturb the plasma. Thin cylindrical
</p>
<p>probes with radii� λD are more commonly used.

energetic electrons, which charge it to a potential of �2 kV. Calculate the flux
of energetic ions bombarding each m2 of the panels.

<p>8.4 An ion velocity analyzer consists of a stainless steel cylinder 5 mm in
</p>
<p>diameter with one end covered with a fine tungsten mesh grid (grid 1). Behind

<p>this, inside the cylinder, are a series of insulated, parallel grids. Grid 1 is at
</p>
<p>&ldquo;floating&rdquo; potential&mdash;it is not electrically connected. Grid 2 is biased negative
</p>
<p>to repel all electrons coming through grid 1, but it transmits ions. Grid 3 is the
</p>
<p>analyzer grid, biased so as to decelerate ions accelerated by grid 2. Those ions
</p>
<p>able to pass through grid 3 are all collected by a collector plate. Grid 4 is a
</p>
<p>suppressor grid that turns back secondary electrons emitted by the collector. If
</p>
<p>the plasma density is too high, a space charge problem occurs near grid
</p>
<p>3 because the ion density is so large that a potential hill forms in front
</p>
<p>of grid 3 and repels ions which would otherwise reach grid 3. Using the
</p>
<p>Child&ndash;Langmuir law, estimate the maximum meaningful He+ current that can
</p>
<p>be measured on a 4-mm-diam collector if grids 2 and 3 are separated by 1 mm
</p>
<p>and 100 V.
</p>
<p>8.3 Ion Acoustic Shock Waves
</p>
<p>When a jet travels faster than sound, it creates a shock wave. This is a basically
</p>
<p>nonlinear phenomenon, since there is no period when the wave is small and
</p>
<p>growing. The jet is faster than the speed of waves in air, so the undisturbed
</p>
<p>medium cannot be &ldquo;warned&rdquo; by precursor signals before the large shock wave
</p>
<p>hits it. In hydrodynamic shock waves, collisions are dominant. Shock waves also
</p>
<p>exist in plasmas, even when there are no collisions. A magnetic shock, the &ldquo;bow
</p>
<p>shock,&rdquo; is generated by the earth as it plows through the interplanetary plasma
</p>
<p>while dragging along a dipole magnetic field. We shall discuss a simpler example:
</p>
<p>a collisionless, one-dimensional shock wave which develops from a large-
</p>
<p>amplitude ion wave.

<p>Figure 8.5 shows the idealized potential profile of an ion acoustic shock wave. The

</p>
<p>constant in time, and we will see a stream of plasma impinging on the wave from
</p>
<p>the left with a velocity u0. For simplicity, let Ti be zero, so that all the ions are
</p>
<p>incident with the same velocity u0, and let the electrons be Maxwellian. Since the
</p>
<p>shock moves much more slowly than the electron thermal speed, the shift in

<p>The behavior of the solution of Eq. (8.27) was made clear by R. Z. Sagdeev, who

<p>used an analogy to an oscillator in a potential well. The displacement x of an

<p>ForM lying in a certain range, this function has the shape shown in Fig. 8.6. If this
</p>
<p>were a real well, a particle entering from the left will go to the right-hand side of the
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.6 The Sagdeev potential V(χ). The upper arrow is the trajectory of a quasiparticle
describing a soliton: it is reflected at the right and returns. The lower arrows show the motion of
</p>
<p>a quasiparticle that has lost energy and is trapped in the potential well. The bouncing back and

<p>well (x&gt; 0), reflect, and return to x&frac14; 0, making a single transit. Similarly, a
quasiparticle in our analogy will make a single excursion to positive χ and return
</p>
<p>to χ&frac14; 0, as shown in Fig. 8.7. Such a pulse is called a soliton; it is a potential and
density disturbance propagating to the left in Fig. 8.7 with velocity u0.
</p>
<p>Now, if a particle suffers a loss of energy while in the well, it will never return to
</p>
<p>x&frac14; 0 but will oscillate (in time) about some positive value of x. Similarly, a little
dissipation will make the potential of a shock wave oscillate (in space) about some
</p>
<p>positive value of ϕ. This is exactly the behavior depicted in Fig. 8.5. Actually,
</p>
<p>dissipation is not needed for this; reflection of ions from the shock front has the
</p>
<p>same effect. To understand this, imagine that the ions have a small thermal spread
</p>
<p>in energy and that the height eϕ of the wave front is just large enough to reflect
</p>
<p>some of the ions back to the left, while the rest go over the potential hill to the right.
</p>
<p>The reflected ions cause an increase in ion density in the upstream region to the left
</p>
<p>of the shock front (Fig. 8.5). This means that the quantity

oscillator has lost velocity and is trapped in the potential well of Fig. 8.6.
</p>
<p>8.3.2 The Critical Mach Numbers
</p>
<p>Solutions of either the soliton type or the wave-train type exist only for a range of
</p>
<p>M. A lower limit forM is given by the condition that V( χ) be a potential well, rather
</p>
<p>than a hill. Expanding Eq. (8.29) for χ� 1 yields
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>2
χ2 � χ2=2M2
</p>
<p>	 

</p>
<p>&gt; 0 M2 &gt; 1 &eth;8:31&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is exactly the same, both physically and mathematically, as the Bohm criterion
</p>
<p>for the existence of a sheath (Eq. (8.11)).
</p>

soliton moving to the left
</p>
<p>8.3 Ion Acoustic Shock Waves 279</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>An upper limit toM is imposed by the condition that the function V( χ) of Fig. 8.6
</p>
<p>must cross the χ axis for χ&gt; 0; otherwise, the virtual particle will not be reflected,
and the potential will rise indefinitely. From Eq. (8.29), we require
</p>
<p>eχ � 1 &lt; M2 1� 1� 2χ
M
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>� �1=2
" #
</p>
<p>&eth;8:32&THORN;
</p>
<p>for some χ&gt; 0. If the lower critical Mach number is surpassed (M &gt; 1), the left-
hand side, representing the integral of the electron density from zero to χ, is initially
</p>
<p>larger than the right-hand side, representing the integral of the ion density. As χ
</p>
<p>increases, the right-hand side can catch up with the left-hand side if M2 is not too
</p>
<p>large. However, because of the square root, the largest value χ can have is M2=2.
</p>
<p>This is because eϕ cannot exceed
1
</p>
<p>2
Mu20; otherwise, ions would be excluded from
</p>
<p>the plasma in the downstream region. Inserting the largest value of χ into Eq. (8.32),
</p>
<p>we have
</p>
<p>exp M2=2
	 

</p>
<p>� 1 &lt; M2 or M &lt; 1:6 &eth;8:33&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is the upper critical Mach number. Shock waves in a cold-ion plasma therefore
</p>
<p>exist only for 1&lt;M&lt; 1.6.
As in the case of sheaths, the physical situation is best explained by a diagram of
</p>
<p>ni and ne vs. χ (Fig. 8.8). This diagram differs from Fig. 8.4 because of the change of
</p>
<p>sign of ϕ. Since the ions are now decelerated rather than accelerated, ni will
</p>
<p>approach infinity at χ &frac14; M2=2. The lower critical Mach number ensures that the
ni curve lies below the ne curve at small χ, so that the potential ϕ(x) starts off with
</p>
<p>the right sign for its curvature. When the curve ni1 crosses the ne curve, the soliton
</p>
<p>ϕ(x) (Fig. 8.7) has an inflection point. Finally, when χ is large enough that the areas
</p>
<p>under the ni and ne curves are equal, the soliton reaches a peak, and the ni1 and ne

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>curves are retraced as χ goes back to zero. The equality of the areas ensures that the
</p>
<p>net charge in the soliton is zero; therefore, there is no electric field outside. If M is
</p>
<p>larger than 1.6, we have the curve ni2, in which the area under the curve is too small
</p>
<p>even when χ has reached its maximum value of M2=2.
</p>
<p>8.3.3 Wave Steepening
</p>
<p>If one propagates an ion wave in a cold-ion plasma, it will have the phase velocity
</p>
<p>given by Eq. (4.42), corresponding toM &frac14; 1. How, then, can one create shocks with
M &gt; 1? One must remember that Eq. (4.42) was a linear result valid only at small
amplitudes. As the amplitude is increased, an ion wave speeds up and also changes
</p>
<p>from a sine wave to a sawtooth shape with a steep leading edge (Fig. 8.9). The
</p>
<p>reason is that the wave electric field has accelerated the ions. In Fig. 8.9, ions at the
</p>
<p>peak of the potential distribution have a larger velocity in the direction of vϕ than
</p>
<p>those at the trough, since they have just experienced a period of acceleration as the
</p>
<p>wave passed by. In linear theory, this difference in velocity is taken into account,
</p>
<p>but not the displacement resulting from it. In nonlinear theory, it is easy to see that
</p>
<p>the ions at the peak are shifted to the right, while those at the trough are shifted to
</p>
<p>the left, thus steepening the wave shape. Since the density perturbation is in phase
</p>
<p>with the potential, more ions are accelerated to the right than to the left, and the
</p>
<p>wave causes a net mass flow in the direction of propagation. This causes the wave
</p>
<p>velocity to exceed the acoustic speed in the undisturbed plasma, so thatM is larger
</p>
<p>than unity.
</p>

<p>8.3.4 Experimental Observations
</p>
<p>Ion acoustic shock waves of the form shown in Fig. 8.5 have been generated by R. J.
</p>
<p>Taylor, D. R. Baker, and H. Ikezi. To do this, a new plasma source, the DP (double-
</p>
<p>plasma) device, was invented. Figure 8.10 shows schematically how it works.
</p>
<p>Identical plasmas are created in two electrically isolated chambers by discharges
</p>
<p>between filaments F and the walls W. The plasmas are separated by the negatively
</p>
<p>biased grid G, which repels electrons and forms an ion sheath on both sides. A
</p>
<p>voltage pulse, usually in the form of a ramp, is applied between the two chambers.
</p>
<p>This causes the ions in one chamber to stream into the other, exciting a large-
</p>
<p>amplitude plane wave. The wave is detected by a movable probe or particle velocity
</p>
<p>analyzer P. Figure 8.11 shows measurements of the density fluctuation in the shock
</p>
<p>wave as a function of time and probe position. It is seen that the wavefront steepens
</p>
<p>and then turns into a shock wave of the classic shape. The damping of the
</p>
<p>oscillations is due to collisions.
</p>
<p>Problem
</p>
<p>8.5 Calculate the maximum possible velocity of an ion acoustic shock wave in an
</p>
<p>experiment such as that shown in Fig. 8.10, where Te&frac14; 1.5 eV, Ti&frac14; 0.2 eV, and
the gas is argon. What is the maximum possible shock wave amplitude in volts?
</p>
<p>8.3.5 Double Layers
</p>
<p>A phenomenon related to sheaths and ion acoustic shocks is that of the double layer.
</p>
<p>This is a localized potential jump, believed to occur naturally in the ionosphere,
</p>

<p>which neither propagates nor is attached to a boundary. The name comes from the
</p>
<p>successive layers of net positive and net negative charge that are necessary to create
</p>
<p>a step in ϕ(x). Such a step can remain stationary in space only if there is a plasma
</p>
<p>flow that Doppler-shifts a shock front down to zero velocity in the lab frame, or if
</p>
<p>the distribution functions of the transmitted and reflected electrons and ions on each
</p>
<p>side of the discontinuity are specially tailored so as to make this possible. Double
</p>
<p>layers have been created in the laboratory in &ldquo;triple-plasma&rdquo; devices, which are
</p>
<p>similar to the DP machine shown in Fig. 8.10, but with a third experimental
</p>
<p>chamber (without filaments) inserted between the two source chambers. By
</p>
<p>adjusting the relative potentials of the three chambers, which are isolated by
</p>
<p>grids, streams of ions or electrons can be spilled into the center chamber to form
</p>
<p>a double layer there. In natural situations double layers are likely to arise where
</p>
<p>there are gradients in the magnetic field B, not where B is zero or uniform as in
laboratory simulations. In that case, the μ&nabla;B force (Eq. (2.38)) can play a large role
</p>
<p>in localizing a double layer away from all boundaries. Indeed, the thermal barrier in
</p>
<p>tandem mirror reactors is an example of a double layer with strong magnetic
</p>
<p>trapping. In Sect. 8.11 we shall see that a double layer can arise in &ldquo;mid-air&rdquo;
</p>
<p>when a dense plasma is injected into a diverging magnetic field. Ions accelerated
</p>
<p>by the potential drop in the double layer can be used to push a spacecraft.

<p>8.4 The Ponderomotive Force
</p>
<p>Light waves exert a radiation pressure which is usually very weak and hard to
</p>
<p>detect. Even the esoteric example of comet tails, formed by the pressure of sunlight,
</p>
<p>is tainted by the added effect of particles streaming from the sun. When high-
</p>
<p>powered microwaves or laser beams are used to heat or confine plasmas, however,
</p>
<p>the radiation pressure can reach several hundred thousand atmospheres! When
</p>
<p>applied to a plasma, this force is coupled to the particles in a somewhat subtle
</p>
<p>way and is called the ponderomotive force. Many nonlinear phenomena have a
</p>
<p>simple explanation in terms of the ponderomotive force.
</p>
<p>The easiest way to derive this nonlinear force is to consider the motion of an
</p>
<p>electron in the oscillating E and B fields of a wave. We neglect dc E0 and B0 fields.
The electron equation of motion is
</p>
<p>m
dv
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14; �e E r&eth; &THORN; &thorn; v	 B r&eth; &THORN;&frac12; 
 &eth;8:34&THORN;
</p>
<p>This equation is exact if E and B are evaluated at the instantaneous position of the
electron. The nonlinearity comes partly from the v	B term, which is second order
because both v and B vanish in the equilibrium, so that the term is no larger than
v1	B1, where v1 and B1 are the linear-theory values. The other part of the
nonlinearity, as we shall see, comes from evaluating E at the actual position of
the particle rather than its initial position. Assume a wave electric field of the form
</p>
<p>E &frac14; Es r&eth; &THORN; cosωt &eth;8:35&THORN;
</p>
<p>where Es(r) contains the spatial dependence. In first order, we may neglect the
v	B term in Eq. (8.34) and evaluate E at the initial position r0. We have
</p>
<p>mdv1=dt &frac14; �eE r0&eth; &THORN; &eth;8:36&THORN;
</p>
<p>v1 &frac14; � e=mω&eth; &THORN;Es sinωt &frac14; dr1=dt &eth;8:37&THORN;
</p>
<p>δr1 &frac14; e=mω2
	 

</p>
<p>Es cosωt &eth;8:38&THORN;
</p>
<p>It is important to note that in a nonlinear calculation, we cannot write eiωt and take
</p>
<p>its real part later. Instead, we write its real part explicitly as cos ωt. This is because
</p>
<p>products of oscillating factors appear in nonlinear theory, and the operations of
</p>
<p>multiplying and taking the real part do not commute.
</p>
<p>Going to second order, we expand E(r) about r0:
</p>
<p>E r&eth; &THORN; &frac14; E r0&eth; &THORN; &thorn; δr1 � &nabla;&eth; &THORN;E r&frac14;r0j &thorn; � � � &eth;8:39&THORN;
</p>
<p>284 8 Nonlinear Effects</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We must now add the term v1	B1, where B1 is given by Maxwell&rsquo;s equation:
</p>
<p>&nabla; 	 E &frac14; �&part;B=&part;t
B1 &frac14; � 1=ω&eth; &THORN;&nabla; 	 Es r&frac14;r0j sinωt

&eth;8:44&THORN;
</p>
<p>If the wave is electromagnetic, the second term in Eq. (8.42) is dominant, and the
</p>
<p>physical mechanism for FNL is as follows. Electrons oscillate in the direction of E,
but the wave magnetic field distorts their orbits. That is, the Lorentz force� ev	B
pushes the electrons in the direction of k (since v is in the direction of E, and E	B
is in the direction of k). The phases of v and B are such that the motion does not
average to zero over an oscillation, but there is a secular drift along k. If the wave
has uniform amplitude, no force is needed to maintain this drift; but if the wave
</p>
<p>amplitude varies, the electrons will pile up in regions of small amplitude, and a
</p>
<p>force is needed to overcome the space charge. This is why the effective force FNL is
proportional to the gradient of hE2i. Since the drift for each electron is the same,
FNL is proportional to the density&mdash;hence the factor ω
</p>
<p>2
p/ω
</p>
<p>2 in Eq. (8.44).
</p>
<p>If the wave is electrostatic, the first term in Eq. (8.42) is dominant. Then the
</p>
<p>physical mechanism is simply that an electron oscillating along k || Emoves farther
in the half-cycle when it is moving from a strong-field region to a weak-field region
</p>
<p>than vice versa, so there is a net drift.
</p>
<p>8.4 The Ponderomotive Force 285</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Although FNL acts mainly on the electrons, the force is ultimately transmitted to
the ions, since it is a low-frequency or dc effect. When electrons are bunched by
</p>
<p>FNL, a charge-separation field Ecs is created. The total force felt by the electrons is
</p>
<p>Fe &frac14; �eEcs &thorn; FNL &eth;8:45&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since the ponderomotive force on the ions is smaller by Ω2p=ω
2
p &frac14; m=M, the force
</p>
<p>on the ion fluid is approximately
</p>
<p>Fi &frac14; eEcs &eth;8:46&THORN;
</p>
<p>Summing the last two equations, we find that the force on the plasma is FNL.
A direct effect of FNL is the self-focusing of laser light in a plasma. In Fig. 8.12
</p>
<p>we see that a laser beam of finite diameter causes a radially directed ponderomotive
</p>
<p>force in a plasma. This force moves plasma out of the beam, so that ωp is lower and
</p>
<p>the dielectric constant ε is higher inside the beam than outside. The plasma then acts
</p>
<p>as a convex lens, focusing the beam to a smaller diameter.
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>8.6 A 1-TW laser beam is focused to a spot 50 μm in diameter on a solid target. A
</p>
<p>plasma is created and heated by the beam, and it tries to expand. The
</p>
<p>ponderomotive force of the beam, which acts mainly on the region of critical
</p>
<p>density (n&frac14; nc, or ω&frac14;ωp), pushes the plasma back and causes &ldquo;profile mod-
ification,&rdquo; which is an abrupt change in density at the critical layer.
</p>
<p>(a) How much pressure (in N/m2 and in lbf/in.2) is exerted by the
</p>
<p>ponderomotive force? (Hint: Note that FNL is in units of N/m
3 and that
</p>
<p>the gradient length cancels out. To calculate hE2i, assume conservatively
that it has the same value as in vacuum, and set the 1-TW Poynting flux
</p>
<p>equal to the beam&rsquo;s energy density times its group velocity in vacuum.)
</p>
<p>(b) What is the total force, in tonnes, exerted by the beam on the plasma?
</p>
<p>(c) If Ti&frac14; Te&frac14; 1 keV, how large a density jump can the light pressure
support?

<p>Consider the mechanical model of Fig. 8.13, in which two oscillatorsM1 andM2 are
</p>
<p>coupled to a bar resting on a pivot. The pivot P is made to slide back and forth at a
</p>
<p>frequency ω0, while the natural frequencies of the oscillators are ω1 and ω2. It is
</p>
<p>clear that, in the absence of friction, the pivot encounters no resistance as long asM1
and M2 are not moving. Furthermore, if P is not moving and M2 is put into motion,
</p>
<p>M1 will move; but as long as ω2 is not the natural frequency of M1, the amplitude
</p>
<p>will be small. Suppose now that both P and M2 are set into motion. The displace-
</p>
<p>ment of M1 is proportional to the product of the displacement of M2 and the length
</p>
<p>of the lever arm and, hence, will vary in time as

</p>
<p>If ω1 is equal to either ω2+ω0 or ω2�ω0, M1 will be resonantly excited and will
grow to large amplitude. Once M1 starts oscillating, M2 will also gain energy,
</p>
<p>because one of the beat frequencies of ω1 with ω0 is just ω2. Thus, once either
</p>
<p>oscillator is started, each will be excited by the other, and the system is unstable.
</p>
<p>The energy, of course, comes from the &ldquo;pump&rdquo; P, which encounters resistance once
</p>
<p>the rod is slanted. If the pump is strong enough, its oscillation amplitude is
</p>
<p>unaffected by M1 and M2; the instability can then be treated by a linear theory. In
</p>
<p>a plasma, the oscillators P, M1, and M2 may be different types of waves.

<p>In the absence of nonlinear interactions, x2 can only have the frequency ω2, so we
</p>
<p>must have ω0 &frac14;ω2. However, the driving terms can cause a frequency shift so that
ω0 is only approximately equal to ω2. Furthermore,ω
</p>
<p>0 can be complex, since there is
damping (which has been neglected so far for simplicity), or there can be growth
</p>
<p>(if there is an instability). In either case, x2 is an oscillator with finite Q and can
</p>
<p>respond to a range of frequencies about ω2. If ω is small, one can see from
</p>
<p>Eq. (8.52) that both choices for ω0 may lie within the bandwidth of x2, and one
must allow for the existence of two oscillators, x2(ω0+ω) and x2(ω0�ω).

lies outside the range of frequencies to which x1 can respond, and x1(2ω0�ω) can
be neglected. We therefore have three oscillators, x1(ω), x2(ω0�ω), and x2(ω0+ω),

For small frequency shifts and small damping or growth rates, we can set ω and

<p>and an ion acoustic wave ω1 (cf. Fig. 4.13). A large-amplitude electron wave (ω0,
</p>
<p>k0) can decay into a backward moving electron wave (ω2, k2) and an ion wave (ω1,
k1). The parallelogram construction ensures that ω0&frac14;ω1+ω2 and k0&frac14; k1+ k2. The
positions of (ω0, k0) and (ω2, k2) on the electron curve must be adjusted so that the
difference vector lies on the ion curve. Note that an electron wave cannot decay into
</p>
<p>two other electron waves, because there is no way to make the difference vector lie
</p>
<p>on the electron curve.
</p>
<p>Figure 8.14b shows the parallelogram construction for the &ldquo;parametric decay&rdquo;
</p>
<p>instability. Here, (ω0, k0) is an incident electromagnetic wave of large phase
velocity (ω0/k0� c). It excites an electron wave and an ion wave moving in opposite
directions. Since jk0j is small, we have jk1j ��jk2j and ω0&frac14;ω1 +ω2 for this
instability.
</p>
<p>Figure 8.14c shows the ω&ndash;k diagram for the &ldquo;parametric backscattering&rdquo; insta-
</p>
<p>bility, in which a light wave excites an ion wave and another light wave moving in
</p>
<p>the opposite direction. This can also happen when the ion wave is replaced by a
</p>
<p>plasma wave. By analogy with similar phenomena in solid state physics, these
</p>
<p>processes are called, respectively, &ldquo;stimulated Brillouin scattering&rdquo; and &ldquo;stimulated
</p>
<p>Raman scattering.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Figure 8.14d represents the two-plasmon decay instability of an electromagnetic
</p>
<p>wave. Note that the two decay waves are both electron plasma waves, so that
</p>
<p>frequency matching can occur only if ω0&rsquo; 2ωp. Expressed in terms of density,
this condition is equivalent to n&rsquo; nc/4, when nc is the critical density (Eq. (4.88))
associated with ω0. This instability can therefore be expected to occur only near the
</p>
<p>&ldquo;quarter-critical&rdquo; layer of an inhomogeneous plasma.
</p>
<p>8.5.3 Instability Threshold
</p>
<p>Parametric instabilities will occur at any amplitude if there is no damping, but in
</p>
<p>practice even a small amount of either collisional or Landau damping will prevent
</p>
<p>the instability unless the pump wave is rather strong. To calculate the threshold, one
</p>
<p>must introduce the damping rates Γ1 and Γ2 of the oscillators x1 and x2. Equation
</p>
<p>(8.48) then becomes

</p>
<p>For instance, if x1 is the displacement of a spring damped by friction, the last term
</p>
<p>represents a force proportional to the velocity. If x1 is the electron density in a
</p>
<p>plasma wave damped by electron&ndash;neutral collisions, Γ1 is vc/2 (cf. Problem 4.5).
</p>
<p>Examination of Eqs. (8.49), (8.50), and (8.54) will show that it is all right to use
</p>
<p>exponential notation and let d/dt!�iω for x1 and x2, as long as we keep E0 real and
allow x1 and x2 to be complex. Equations (8.49) and (8.50) become

</p>
<p>8.5.4 Physical Mechanism
</p>
<p>The parametric excitation of waves can be understood very simply in terms of the
</p>
<p>ponderomotive force (Sect. 8.4). As an illustration, consider the case of an electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic wave (ω0, k0) driving an electron plasma wave (ω2, k2) and a
</p>
<p>low-frequency ion wave (ω1, k1) (Fig. 8.14b). Since ω1 is small, ω0 must be close
</p>
<p>to ωp. However, the behavior is quite different for ω0&lt;ωp than for ω0&gt;ωp. The
former case gives rise to the &ldquo;oscillating two-stream&rdquo; instability (which will be
</p>
<p>treated in detail), and the latter to the &ldquo;parametric decay&rdquo; instability.
</p>
<p>Suppose there is a density perturbation in the plasma of the form n1 cos k1x; this
</p>
<p>perturbation can occur spontaneously as one component of the thermal noise. Let
</p>
<p>the pump wave have an electric field E0 cos ω0t in the x direction, as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.15. In the absence of a dc field B0, the pump wave follows the relation
</p>
<p>ω20 &frac14; ω2p &thorn; c2k20, so that k0� 0 for ω0�ωp. We may therefore regard E0 as spatially
uniform. If ω0 is less than ωp, which is the resonant frequency of the cold electron
</p>
<p>fluid, the electrons will move in the direction opposite to E0, while the ions do not
</p>
<p>move on the time scale of ω0. The density ripple then causes a charge separation, as
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 8.15. The electrostatic charges create a field E1, which oscillates at
</p>
<p>the frequency ω0. The ponderomotive force due to the total field is given by
</p>
<p>Eq. (8.44):

<p>ε0 &eth;8:64&THORN;
</p>
<p>This force does not average to zero, since E1 changes sign with E0. As seen in
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.15, FNL is zero at the peaks and troughs of n1 but is large where&nabla;n1 is large.
</p>
<p>This spatial distribution causes FNL to push electrons from regions of low density to
regions of high density. The resulting de electric field drags the ions along also, and
</p>
<p>the density perturbation grows. The threshold value of FNL is the value just
</p>
<p>sufficient to overcome the pressure &nabla;ni1(KTi+KTe), which tends to smooth the
</p>
<p>density. The density ripple does not propagate, so that Re(ω1)&frac14; 0. This is called the
oscillating two-stream instability because the sloshing electrons have a time-
</p>
<p>averaged distribution function which is double-peaked, as in the two-stream insta-
</p>
<p>bility (Sect. 6.6).
</p>
<p>If ω0 is larger than ωp, this physical mechanism does not work, because an
</p>
<p>oscillator driven faster than its resonant frequency moves opposite to the direction
</p>
<p>of the applied force (this will be explained more clearly in the next section). The
</p>
<p>directions of ve, E1, and FNL are then reversed on Fig. 8.15, and the ponderomotive
force moves ions from dense regions to less dense regions. If the density

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>perturbation did not move, it would decay. However, if it were a traveling ion
</p>
<p>acoustic wave, the inertial delay between the application of the force FNL and the
</p>
<p>change of ion positions causes the density maxima to move into the regions into
</p>
<p>which FNL is pushing the ions. This can happen, of course, only if the phase velocity
</p>
<p>of the ion wave has just the right value. That this value is vs can be seen from the
</p>
<p>fact that the phase of the force FNL in Fig. 8.15 (with the arrows reversed now) is
</p>
<p>exactly the same as the phase of the electrostatic restoring force in an ion wave,
</p>
<p>where the potential is maximum at the density maximum and vice versa. Conse-
</p>
<p>quently, FNL adds to the restoring force and augments the ion wave. The electrons,
</p>
<p>meanwhile, oscillate with large amplitude if the pump field is near the natural
</p>
<p>frequency of the electron fluid; namely, ω22 &frac14; ω2p &thorn; 32k2v2th. The pump cannot have
exactly the frequency ω2 because the beat between ω0 and ω2 must be at the ion
</p>
<p>wave frequency ω1&frac14; kvs, so that the expression for FNL in Eq. (8.64) can have the
right frequency to excite ion waves. If this frequency matching is satisfied, viz.,
</p>
<p>ω1&frac14;ω0�ω2, both an ion wave and an electron wave are excited at the expense of
the pump wave. This is the mechanism of the parametric decay instability.

</p>
<p>ω1 vanishes in that case because the ion wave has ω1&frac14; 0 in the zero-temperature
limit.
</p>
<p>8.5.6 The Parametric Decay Instability
</p>
<p>The derivation for ω0&gt;ωp follows the same lines as above and leads to the
excitation of a plasma wave and an ion wave. We shall omit the algebra, which is
</p>
<p>somewhat lengthier than for the oscillating two-stream instability, but shall instead
</p>
<p>describe some experimental observations. The parametric decay instability is well
</p>
<p>documented, having been observed both in the ionosphere and in the laboratory.
</p>
<p>The oscillating two-stream instability is not often seen, partly because Re(ω)&frac14; 0
and partly because ω0&lt;ωp means that the incident wave is evanescent. Figure 8.16
shows the apparatus of Stenzel and Wong, consisting of a plasma source similar to
</p>
<p>that of Fig. 8.10, a pair of grids between which the field E0 is generated by an
</p>
<p>oscillator, and a probe connected to two frequency spectrum analyzers. Figure 8.17
</p>
<p>shows spectra of the signals detected in the plasma. Below threshold, the high-
</p>
<p>frequency spectrum shows only the pump wave at 400 MHz, while the
</p>
<p>low-frequency spectrum shows only a small amount of noise. When the pump
</p>
<p>wave amplitude is increased slightly, an ion wave at 300 kHz appears in the
</p>
<p>low-frequency spectrum; and at the same time, a sideband at 399.7 MHz appears
</p>
<p>in the high-frequency spectrum. The latter is an electron plasma wave at the
</p>
<p>difference frequency. The ion wave then can be observed to beat with the pump
</p>
<p>wave to give a small signal at the sum frequency, 400.3 MHz.
</p>
<p>This instability has also been observed in ionospheric experiments. Figure 8.18
</p>
<p>shows the geometry of an ionospheric modification experiment performed with the
</p>

</p>
<p>7 MHz is launched from the antenna into the ionosphere. At the layer where ω0 ≳
</p>
<p>ωp, electron and ion waves are generated, and the ionospheric electrons are heated.
</p>
<p>In another experiment with the large dish antenna at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, the ω
</p>

</p>
<p>8.12 In laser fusion, a pellet containing thermonuclear fuel is heated by intense

<p>laser beams. The parametric decay instability can enhance the heating effi-
</p>
<p>ciency by converting laser energy into plasma wave energy, which is then
</p>
<p>transferred to electrons by Landau damping. If an iodine laser with 1.3-μm
</p>
<p>wavelength is used, at what plasma density does parametric decay take place?

<p>8.6 Plasma Echoes
</p>
<p>Since Landau damping does not involve collisions or dissipation, it is a reversible
</p>
<p>process. That this is true is vividly demonstrated by the remarkable phenomenon of
</p>
<p>plasma echoes. Figure 8.19 shows a schematic of the experimental arrangement.
</p>
<p>A plasma wave with frequency ω1 and wavelength λ1 is generated at the first grid
</p>
<p>and propagated to the right. The wave is Landau-damped to below the threshold of
</p>
<p>detectability. A second wave of ω2 and λ2 is generated by a second grid a distance
</p>
<p>l from the first one. The second wave also damps away. If a third grid connected to a
</p>
<p>receiver tuned to ω&frac14;ω2�ω1 is moved along the plasma column, it will find an
echo at a distance l0 &frac14; lω2/(ω2�ω1). What happens is that the resonant particles
causing the first wave to damp out retains information about the wave in their
</p>
<p>distribution function. If the second grid is made to reverse the change in the
</p>
<p>resonant particle distribution, a wave can be made to reappear. Clearly, this process
</p>
<p>can occur only in a very nearly collisionless plasma. In fact, the echo amplitude has
</p>
<p>been used as a sensitive measure of the collision rate. Figure 8.20 gives a physical
</p>
<p>picture of why echoes occur. The same basic mechanism lies behind observations
</p>

<p>of echoes with electron plasma waves or cyclotron waves. Figure 8.20 is a plot of
</p>
<p>distance vs. time, so that the trajectory of a particle with a given velocity is a
</p>
<p>straight line. At x&frac14; 0, a grid periodically allows bunches of particles with a spread
in velocity to pass through. Because of the velocity spread, the bunches mix
</p>
<p>together, and after a distance l, the density, shown at the right of the diagram,
</p>
<p>becomes constant in time. A second grid at x&frac14; l alternately blocks and passes
particles at a higher frequency. This selection of particle trajectories in space&ndash;time
</p>
<p>then causes a bunching of particles to reoccur at x&frac14; l0.
The relation between l0 and l can be obtained from this simplified picture, which
</p>
<p>neglects the influence of the wave electric field on the particle trajectories. If f1(v) is
</p>

<p>The spread in velocities, therefore, does not affect the second term at x&frac14; l0, and the
phase mixing has been undone. When integrated over velocity, this term gives a
</p>
<p>density fluctuation at ω&frac14;ω2�ω1. The first term is undetectable because phase
mixing has smoothed the density perturbations. It is clear that l0 is positive only if
ω2&gt;ω1. The physical reason is that the second grid has less distance in which to
unravel the perturbations imparted by the first grid, and hence must operate at a
</p>
<p>higher frequency.

<p>8.7 Nonlinear Landau Damping
</p>
<p>When the amplitude of an electron or ion wave excited, say, by a grid is followed in

</p>
<p>theory, if the amplitude is large. Instead, one typically finds that the amplitude

<p>decays, grows again, and then oscillates before settling down to a steady value.
</p>
<p>Such behavior for an electron wave at 38 MHz is shown in Fig. 8.22. Although
</p>
<p>other effects may also be operative, these oscillations in amplitude are exactly what
</p>
<p>would be expected from the nonlinear effect of particle trapping discussed in
</p>
<p>Sect. 7.5. Trapping of a particle of velocity v occurs when its energy in the wave

<p>Small waves will trap only these particles moving at high speeds near vϕ. To trap a

<p>The frequency ω is not constant unless x is small, sin kx� kx, and ϕ is approxi-
mately parabolic. Then ω takes the value ωB defined in Eq. (8.89). When the
</p>
<p>resonant particles are reflected by the potential, they give kinetic energy back to
</p>
<p>the wave, and the amplitude increases. When the particles bounce again from the
</p>
<p>other side, the energy goes back into the particles, and the wave is damped. Thus,
</p>
<p>one would expect oscillations in amplitude at the frequency ωB in the wave frame.
</p>
<p>In the laboratory frame, the frequency would be ω0 &frac14;ωB+ kvϕ; and the amplitude
oscillations would have wave number k0 &frac14;ω0/vϕ&frac14; k[1 + (ωB/ω)]. The condition ωB
≳ ω turns out to define the breakdown of linear theory even when other processes
</p>
<p>besides particle trapping are responsible.
</p>
<p>Another type of nonlinear Landau damping involves the beating of two waves.
</p>
<p>Suppose there are two high-frequency electron waves (ω1, k1) and (ω2, k2). These
</p>
<p>would beat to form an amplitude envelope traveling at a velocity (ω2�ω1)/
(k2� k1)� dω/dk&frac14; vg. This velocity may be low enough to lie within the ion
distribution function. There can then be an energy exchange with the resonant
</p>

<p>8.8 Equations of Nonlinear Plasma Physics
</p>
<p>There are two nonlinear equations that have been treated extensively in connection
</p>
<p>with nonlinear plasma waves: The Korteweg&ndash;de Vries equation and the nonlinear
</p>
<p>Schr&euro;odinger equation. Each concerns a different type of nonlinearity. When an ion
</p>
<p>acoustic wave gains large amplitude, the main nonlinear effect is wave steepening,
</p>
<p>whose physical explanation was given in Sect. 8.3.3. This effect arises from the
</p>
<p>v &middot;&nabla;v term in the ion equation of motion and is handled mathematically by the
Korteweg&ndash;de Vries equation. The wave-train and soliton solutions of Figs. 8.5 and
</p>
<p>8.7 are also predicted by this equation.
</p>
<p>When an electron plasma wave goes nonlinear, the dominant new effect is that
</p>
<p>the ponderomotive force of the plasma waves causes the background plasma to
</p>
<p>move away, causing a local depression in density called a caviton. Plasma waves
</p>
<p>trapped in this cavity then form an isolated structure called an envelope soliton or
</p>
<p>envelope solitary wave. Such solutions are described by the nonlinear Schr&euro;odinger
</p>
<p>equation. Considering the difference in both the physical model and the mathemat-
</p>
<p>ical form of the governing equations, it is surprising that solitons and envelope
</p>
<p>solitons have almost the same shape.
</p>
<p>8.8.1 The Korteweg&ndash;de Vries Equation
</p>
<p>This equation occurs in many physical situations including that of a weakly
</p>
<p>nonlinear ion wave:

&frac14; 0 &eth;8:92&THORN;
</p>
<p>whereU is amplitude, and τ and ξ are timelike and spacelike variables, respectively.
</p>
<p>Although several transformations of variables will be necessary before this form is
</p>
<p>obtained, two physical features can already be seen. The second term in Eq. (8.92)
</p>
<p>is easily recognized as the convective term v &middot;&nabla;v leading to wave steepening.

<p>The third term arises from wave dispersion; that is, the k dependence of the phase
</p>
<p>velocity. For Ti&frac14; 0, ion waves obey the relation (Eq. (4.48))

</p>
<p>steep wavefronts (corresponding to very large k) from spuriously dominating the

<p>the energy, the larger the speed and amplitude, and the narrower the width. The

<p>in that the potential V(x, t) depends on ψ itself, making the last term nonlinear.
</p>
<p>Note, however, that V depends only on the magnitude jψ j2 and not on the phase of
ψ . This is to be expected, as far as electron plasma waves are concerned, because
</p>
<p>the nonlinearity comes from the ponderomotive force, which depends on the
</p>
<p>gradient of the wave intensity.
</p>
<p>Plane wave solutions of Eq. (8.122) are modulationally unstable if pq&gt; 0; that
is, a ripple on the envelope of the wave will tend to grow. The picture is the same as
</p>
<p>that of Fig. 8.24 even though we are considering here fluid, rather than discrete
</p>
<p>particle, effects. For plasma waves, it is easy to see how the ponderomotive force
</p>
<p>can cause a modulational instability. Figure 8.26 shows a plasma wave with a
</p>
<p>rippled envelope. The gradient in wave intensity causes a ponderomotive force
</p>
<p>which moves both electrons and ions toward the intensity minima, forming a ripple
</p>
<p>in the plasma density. Plasma waves are trapped in regions of low density because

<p>ω2 &frac14; ω2p &thorn;

k2v2th &eth;4:30&THORN;

<p>permits waves of large k to exist only in regions of small ωp. The trapping of part of
</p>
<p>the k spectrum further enhances the wave intensity in the regions where it was
</p>
<p>already high, thus causing the envelope to develop a growing ripple.
</p>
<p>The reason the sign of pq matters is that p and q for plasma waves turn out to be
</p>
<p>proportional, respectively, to the group dispersion dvg/dk and the nonlinear fre-
</p>
<p>quency shift δω / &part;ω/&part;jψ j2. We shall show later that
</p>

</p>
<p>Modulational instability occurs when pq&gt; 0; that is, when δω and dvg/dk have
opposite signs. Figure 8.27 illustrates why this is so. In Fig. 8.27a, a ripple in the
</p>
<p>wave envelope has developed as a result of random fluctuations. Suppose δω is
</p>
<p>negative. Then the phase velocity ω/k, which is proportional to ω, becomes some-
</p>
<p>what smaller in the region of high intensity. This causes the wave crests to pile up on
</p>
<p>the left of Fig. 8.27b and to spread out on the right. The local value of k is therefore
</p>
<p>large on the left and small on the right. If dvg/dk is positive, the group velocity will be
</p>
<p>larger on the left than the right, so the wave energy will pile up into a smaller space.
</p>
<p>Thus, the ripple in the envelope will become narrower and larger, as in Fig. 8.27c. If
</p>
<p>δω and dvg/dkwere of the same sign, this modulational instability would not happen.
</p>
<p>Although plane wave solutions to Eq. (8.123) are modulationally unstable when
</p>
<p>pq&gt; 0, there can be solitary structures called envelope solitons which are stable.
These are generated from the basic solution

<p>If the condition V2� E2 is not satisfied, the ion dynamics must be treated more
carefully; one has coupled electron and ion solitons which evolve together in time.
</p>
<p>This is the situation normally encountered in experiment and has been treated

<p>theoretically.
</p>
<p>In summary, a Langmuir-wave soliton is described by Eq. (8.125), with p&frac14; 3/2
and q&frac14; 1/8 and with ψ(x, t) signifying the low-frequency part of u(x, t), where u, x,
and t are all in dimensionless units. Inserting the exp (�iω0t) factor and letting x0
and θ0 be zero, we can write Eq. (8.125) as follows:

</p>
<p>&eth;8:154&THORN;
</p>
<p>The envelope of the soliton propagates with a velocity V, which is so far
</p>
<p>unspecified. To find it accurately involves simultaneously solving a Korteweg&ndash;de
</p>
<p>Vries equation describing the motion of the density cavity, but the underlying
</p>
<p>physics can be explained much more simply. The electron plasma waves have a
</p>
<p>group velocity, and Vmust be near this velocity if the wave energy is to move along
</p>
<p>with the envelope. In dimensionless units, this velocity is, from Eq. (8.150),

</p>
<p>The term i(V/3)x in the exponent of Eq. (8.154) is therefore just the ikx
</p>
<p>factor indicating propagation of the waves inside the envelope. Similarly, the
</p>
<p>factor� i(V2/6)t is just� i(3/2)k02 t0, which can be recognized from Eq. (8.149) as
the Bohm&ndash;Gross frequency for δn0 &frac14; 0, the factor &frac12; coming from expansion of
the square root. Since ω0&rsquo;ωp, the terms ω0+ (V2/6) represent the Bohm&ndash;Gross
frequency, and A is therefore the frequency shift (in units of ωp) due to the cavity in
</p>
<p>δn0. The soliton amplitude and width are given in Eq. (8.154) in terms of the shift A,
and the high-frequency electric field can be found from Eq. (8.138).
</p>
<p>Cavitons have been observed in devices similar to that of Fig. 8.16. Figures 8.29
</p>
<p>and 8.30 show two experiments in which structures like the envelope solitons
</p>
<p>discussed above have been generated by injecting high-power rf into a quiescent
</p>
<p>plasma. These experiments initiated the interpretation of laser-fusion data in terms
</p>
<p>of &ldquo;profile modification,&rdquo; or the change in density profile caused by the

<p>ponderomotive force of laser radiation near the critical layer, where ω0&rsquo;ωp,

<p>become very dense, and hence highly collisional. In that case, plasma can diffuse
</p>
<p>across field lines and change the magnetic geometry. Due to kinetic effects, this can
</p>
<p>happen even without collisions. Reconnection of magnetic field lines occurs in the
</p>
<p>earth&rsquo;s field on the night side, as shown in Fig. 8.31. The plasma of the solar wind
</p>
<p>pushes the earth&rsquo;s dipole field away from the sun into a magnetotail, where field
</p>
<p>lines in opposite directions are brought close to one another. The magnetic config-
</p>
<p>uration can change, as shown in Fig. 8.32. In the magnetotail, the left-hand part
</p>
<p>becomes a loop connected to the earth&rsquo;s poles, while the right-hand part breaks off
</p>
<p>to connect to the interplanetary field. At the magnetopause, the lines break and
</p>
<p>connect to the solar wind.
</p>
<p>What happens in the thin reconnecting layer shown in Fig. 8.33 is extremely
</p>
<p>complicated because both collisional and collisionless damping mechanisms, as
</p>
<p>well as finite-Larmor-radius effects can occur there. There are many models for the
</p>
<p>conditions in the layer. In the Sweet-Parker model, B and entrained n diffuse into
</p>
<p>the layer by resistive diffusion, building up a high density there which must escape
</p>
<p>at a large velocity v0 of the order of the Alfvén speed. H. Petschek showed that
</p>
<p>MHD shocks can occur in fast reconnection, but these do not stay long enough to

<p>8.10 Turbulence
</p>
<p>In Chap. 4 we treated waves in a plasma by linearizing the equations of motion, thus
</p>
<p>limiting the discussion to waves of small amplitude. Sinusoidal waves cannot grow
</p>
<p>indefinitely, however; nonlinear effects change their shapes, limit their amplitudes,
</p>
<p>and ultimately turning them into random turbulence. Figure 8.35 shows a jet of air
</p>
<p>forming vortices and then breaking into turbulence. In pipes carrying a liquid, the
</p>
<p>flow is smooth at low velocities, when the velocity has a smooth profile from slow
</p>
<p>at the edge to fast at the center, as seen in Fig. 8.36 (top). At high velocities, the flow
</p>
<p>breaks up into turbulence, as in Fig. 8.36 (bottom). The flow slows down, and
</p>
<p>energy goes into noise. Nonlinearity can happen in a plasma in other ways. For
</p>
<p>instance, in the plasma oscillation of Fig. 4.2, the amplitude can become so large
</p>
<p>that the excursion of an electron sheet can overlap the next wavelength. In early
</p>
<p>experiments in which a current was drawn between an anode and a cathode in a
</p>
<p>magnetized cylinder, probes inserted into the plasma always detected turbulent
</p>
<p>fluctuations like those shown in Fig. 8.37. The basic waves that grew into this

<p>nonlinear state were not found for years. We now know of many instabilities that
</p>
<p>can cause this.
</p>
<p>A turbulent field can be decomposed into a spectrum of eddies of different sizes.
</p>
<p>After excitation, the distribution of sizes&mdash;the turbulent spectrum S(k)&mdash;will settle
</p>
<p>down to a form predictable by theory. In two-dimensional systems, such as a sheet
</p>
<p>of graphene, small eddies will coalesce into larger eddies. In general, however,
</p>
<p>large eddies will break up into small eddies with a given size distribution. In
</p>
<p>ordinary hydrodynamics, Kolmogoroff found from dimensional analysis that the
</p>
<p>spectrum should vary as k�5/3. In laboratory plasmas, the turbulence is driven by
instabilities such as the Rayleigh-Taylor or drift-wave instabilities, and electron
</p>
<p>motions are dominated by their E	B drifts. Early experiments at Princeton
showed consistent spectra varying as k�5 even in entirely different machines, as
shown in Fig. 8.38. Because plasma moves very differently from normal fluids, it is
</p>
<p>not surprising that the exponent of k is quite different. The boundary-dependent
</p>
<p>peaks in Fig. 8.38 are from the low-frequency instabilities driving the turbulence.
</p>
<p>By contrast, the spectrum in an early tokamak (PLT) at Princeton, shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.39, varies as k�2.8.
In the modern era, electrostatic probes cannot be inserted into a tokamak, and
</p>
<p>non-invasive diagnostics must be used, such as reflectometry. The turbulent spec-
</p>
<p>trum will vary greatly with position because of sawtooth oscillations in the interior
</p>
<p>and Edge Localized Modes near the boundary. Generalizations such as those from
</p>
<p>the early days can no longer be made. With the advent of fast computers, turbulence
</p>
<p>in the three-dimensional geometry of a tokamak can be simulated. Figure 8.40
</p>
<p>shows such a computation. The magnetic field lines are no longer in the well-
</p>
<p>ordered magnetic island structure but are completely scrambled.

<p>8.11 Sheath Boundaries
</p>
<p>Laboratory plasmas are not infinitely long cylinders, as many theories assume.
</p>
<p>Plasmas of finite length in a B-field have sheaths at the endplates which control the
</p>
<p>density profiles. As an example, consider the discharge in Fig. 8.43, which is short
</p>
<p>enough that gradients in the z direction can be neglected but long enough that the
</p>
<p>end sheaths do not overlap. The magnetic field is strong enough to confine the
</p>
<p>electrons to move rapidly only in the z direction, and to move in the r direction only
</p>
<p>via collisions. But the B-field is weak enough that we can neglect the curvature of
</p>
<p>the ion orbits inside the radius a. We now describe the Simon short-circuit effect,
</p>
<p>which causes the electrons to behave as if they could cross the magnetic field
</p>
<p>rapidly although they actually do not.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 8.44a, the top of each figure is the radial boundary; the bottom is the
</p>
<p>interior of the discharge. We assume that radiofrequency power is applied at r&frac14; a,
so that initially n is higher in tube ① than in tube ②. The sheath at the endplate
</p>
<p>adjusts itself to allow the electron loss to be equal to the ion loss at the Bohm
</p>
<p>velocity cs at each r, thus keeping the plasma neutral. The sheath drop ϕp(r) is
</p>
<p>therefore given by

</p>
<p>where the bracket on the l.h.s. is the random electron velocity in one dimension, and
</p>
<p>the one on the r.h.s. is the acoustic speed. Since ϕp is independent of n, the sheath
</p>
<p>drop is normally independent of radius. However, when ions are injected at r&frac14; a,
they diffuse inward from tube ① to tube ②. Electrons can&rsquo;t follow them, but the
</p>
<p>sheath drop on tube ② can increase slightly to trap more electrons to keep tube ②
</p>
<p>neutral. The sheath on tube② is becomes thicker than the one on tube①, as shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 8.44a. This mechanism allows electrons to fall into thermal equilibrium and
</p>
<p>follow the Boltzmann relation for over all radii:

</p>
<p>During the approach to equilibrium, the higher density on the outside causes ϕ to be
</p>
<p>higher there, and this corresponds to a radial E-field pointing inwards, as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.44b. The field drives the ions toward the center at a fast rate scaled to KTe.
</p>
<p>There cannot be an E-field along B because that would cause a large electron

<p>current, and the sheaths have stopped that. Therefore, the ions cannot leave the
</p>
<p>center except at their low thermal velocities. The ion density builds up there until an
</p>
<p>outward E-field following Eq. (3.73) drives outward any ions that are created in the
</p>
<p>interior. If all ions are created at the boundary, n(r) would be flat. The equilibrium
</p>
<p>sheaths and fields are shown in Fig. 8.44c. A 2011 theory by Curreli and Chen
</p>
<p>showed that a discharge with the geometry of Fig. 8.43 with sheaths at the endplates
</p>
<p>will fall into an equilibrium with a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; density profile which is independent

<p>of pressure and plasma radius a.

<p>Special Plasmas
</p>
<p>9.1 Non-Neutral Plasmas
</p>
<p>9.1.1 Pure Electron Plasmas
</p>
<p>The concepts of plasma physics have so far been couched in terms of well-behaved,
</p>
<p>quasineutral plasmas, but there are other plasmas with special properties. Particle
</p>
<p>accelerators have a single species, but the kinematic effects are so large that the
</p>
<p>collective effects are not important. It is possible to generate single-species plasmas
</p>
<p>at low densities such that the electric fields are manageable. Ronald Davidson,
</p>
<p>Malmberg and O&rsquo;Neil, Dan Dubin, and others have developed this interesting topic.
</p>
<p>Consider an infinite cylinder of electrons of uniform density n0 in a uniform coaxial
</p>
<p>magnetic field B (Fig. 9.1). A large electric fieldE &frac14; Er r&eth; &THORN;r̂ will arise, (where Er is
negative), and a typical fluid element of electrons will drift in a circular orbit, since
</p>
<p>everything is azimuthally symmetric. Those with small, off-axis orbits will drift
</p>
<p>around the axis in &ldquo;diocotron&rdquo; orbits, as shown at the right. We wish to calculate the
</p>
<p>rotation frequency ωr:
</p>

</p>
<p>With appropriate modifications, these equations can also describe pure ion
</p>
<p>plasmas. Both types of single-species plasmas have been produced and studied in
</p>
<p>the laboratory.
</p>
<p>9.1.2 Experiments
</p>
<p>A device called a Malmberg-Penning trap, shown in Fig. 9.2, is commonly used to
</p>
<p>study single-species plasmas. This useful device evolved from the work of
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.1 A non-neutral plasma of electrons. (Adapted from R.C. Davidson, Physics of Nonneutral
plasmas (Addison-Wesley, Redwood City, CA, 1990)).

<p>Wolfgang Paul, Hans Dehmelt, and Norman Ramsey,1 who won the Nobel Prize in
</p>
<p>1989. The trap consists of three coaxial, conducting cylinders, with the ends biased
</p>
<p>negatively to trap electrons and positively to trap ions. Conservation of canonical
</p>
<p>angular momentum can be used to show that the particles are trapped unless they
</p>
<p>make a collision with a stray neutral atom or with a error field due to imperfect
</p>
<p>machining of the container. The physical reason for this can be seen from Fig. 5.16,
</p>
<p>which shows that like-particle collisions do not cause diffusion.
</p>
<p>As an example of what can be done with these plasmas, F. Anderegg
</p>
<p>et al. studied diffusion due to long-range interactions. Recall that Spitzer diffusion
</p>
<p>(Eq. (5.71)) had an arbitrary cutoff related to the Debye length. Ion-ion diffusion
</p>
<p>was quantified in an ion trap with LIF (laser-induced fluorescence) diagnostics. In
</p>
<p>the data shown in Fig. 9.3, one sees that the measured diffusion coefficient is an
</p>
<p>order of magnitude larger than &ldquo;classical&rdquo; but is closer when collisions in large-
</p>
<p>orbit E�B drifts are included.
</p>
<p>9.2 Solid, Ultra-Cold Plasmas
</p>
<p>By freezing the plasma in an ion trap to sub-Kelvin temperatures, it is possible to
</p>
<p>create liquid and solid plasmas. As the thermal motions of the particles decrease,
</p>
<p>their thermal energies become comparable to the Coulomb energy Wc between
</p>
<p>particles. This condition can be quantified by defining a coupling parameter Γ, the
</p>
<p>ratio between the average Wc and KT. Two singly charged particles separated by a
</p>
<p>distance a have a Coulomb energy e2/a. Hence

<p>The average interparticle distance a should vary as n1/3, but the coefficient depends
</p>
<p>on the shape of the enclosing volume. The value of a can be approximated by the
</p>
<p>Wigner-Seitz radius:
</p>
<p>a &frac14; 3=4πn&eth; &THORN;1=3 � 0:62n1=3: &eth;9:7&THORN;
</p>
<p>When Γ, as defined by Eqs. (9.6) and (9.7), becomes large, the plasma first turns
</p>
<p>into a liquid as fluid elements become highly correlated. At Γ&gt; 174, the plasma
becomes a solid crystal such as the one shown in Fig. 9.4. To achieve such a large
</p>
<p>value of Γ, the plasma is cooled to a temperature of 10 mK (10 milliKelviin, or
</p>
<p>0.01 K) by laser cooling. In this process, a laser is tuned to a frequency just below that
</p>
<p>of a transition in the atom. A laser photon is absorbed only by atoms moving rapidly
</p>
<p>toward the laser with a blue Doppler shift. The atom&rsquo;s momentum is lowered by that
</p>
<p>of the photon. The photon is later re-emitted in a random direction at a lower
</p>
<p>frequency, so that the fastest atoms are removed, and the plasma is cooled.
</p>
<p>The Penning trap is a useful device in which unusual plasmas have been created.
</p>
<p>For instance, a positronium plasma has been formed, consisting of positrons and
</p>
<p>electrons, with no ions. Also possible is the creation of anti-hydrogen, whose atoms
</p>
<p>consist of negative antiprotons and positrons.

<p>9.4 Dusty Plasmas
</p>
<p>In Chap. 5 we considered three-component plasmas consisting ions, electrons, and
</p>
<p>neutral atoms in partially ionized plasmas. In general, there can be contaminants of
</p>
<p>macroscopic size, &ldquo;dust&rdquo;, made of other atomic species. In outer space, comet tails
</p>
<p>are dusty plasmas, as are some nebulas, such as the Orion nebula, and planetary
</p>
<p>rings, such as the one on Saturn. On earth, dusty plasmas can exist in flames; rocket
</p>
<p>exhausts; thermonuclear explosions; atmospheric-pressure plasmas (Sect. 9.6); and,
</p>
<p>importantly, in plasma processing (see Chap. 10). We shall find that dust has two
</p>
<p>main effects. First, it introduces low-frequency waves in the motions of the charged
</p>
<p>dust. Second, it changes the quasineutrality condition so that ne is no longer equal to
</p>
<p>Zni, thus modifying the normal waves in the plasma.
</p>
<p>Dust grains have sizes from tens of nanometers to hundreds of microns. Since
</p>
<p>electrons impinge on them much more often than ions do, the grains will have a
</p>
<p>negative surface potential Vs. Consider a spherical grain of radius a and charge
</p>
<p>q&lt; 0. The capacitance of the sphere (with distant walls) is
</p>
<p>C &frac14; 4πε0a: &eth;9:16&THORN;
</p>
<p>The surface charge q is then
</p>
<p>q &frac14; CVs &frac14; 4πε0aVs: &eth;9:17&THORN;
</p>
<p>The value of either q or Vs depends on the Debye length λD in the background
</p>
<p>plasma.
</p>
<p>If λD is � a, the grain is a small, isolated particle like a spherical Langmuir
probe (Sect. 8.2.5). An ion will be attracted to the grain and will either strike it or
</p>
<p>orbit around it, depending on its orbital angular momentum around the grain.
</p>
<p>Enough electrons will be collected to ensure that the net current is zero. The
</p>
<p>required value of Vs is the &ldquo;floating potential&rdquo; of probe theory, which we need
</p>
<p>not discuss here. On the other hand, if λD is �a, the grains are a third charged
component of the plasma along with the ions and electrons. For instance, in a Cs

</p>
<p>� a is satisfied.
Assume the latter condition, and let the dust grains have a charge Zd&lt; 0 and a
</p>
<p>density nd. Charge neutrality requires
</p>
<p>ni &frac14; ne � Zdnd: &eth;9:18&THORN;
</p>
<p>Thus, the &ldquo;electron&rdquo; density is lowered by the presence of dust. This has been
</p>
<p>observed by Barkan et al. in a potassium Q-machine (Fig. 4.14). The dust,
</p>
<p>consisting of aluminum silicate particles of 5-μm average radius, was dropped
</p>
<p>into the plasma through a mesh on a rotating cylinder surrounding the plasma.
</p>
<p>The dust density was about 5� 104 cm�3. Figure 9.6 shows Langmuir probe traces
of the plasma with and without the dust. In the presence of dust, the electron
</p>
<p>saturation current is seen to be lowered by the slow velocities of the heavy dust.
</p>
<p>Studies of how dust is charged include many minor effects too detailed to be
</p>
<p>described here; for instance, secondary electron emission upon ion or electron
</p>
<p>impact, photoemission of electrons (often the dominant mechanism in cosmic
</p>
<p>plasmas), and field emission. It is not surprising that dust particles can arrange
</p>
<p>themselves in crystal arrays. Figure 9.7 shows how a picture of such a crystal can be
</p>
<p>obtained. A plasma is formed by RF applied to the bottom electrode, and dust is
</p>
<p>introduced by a shaker that is not shown; The dust is illuminated by a laser beam
</p>
<p>spread into a plane by a cylindrical lens, and a camera records the dust through a

<p>modified through the quasi-neutrality condition (Eq. (9.18)), an example of which is

<p>the &ldquo;dust ion-acoustic wave&rdquo;, which is analyzed below. We begin by considering

<p>The dust acoustic wave is a very low-frequency, longitudinal compressional wave

<p>involving the motions of the dust particles. Because the heavy dust moves more

<p>9.5 Helicon Plasmas
</p>
<p>So far, we have mainly treated plasmas consisting of charged species: negative
</p>
<p>ones, such as electrons and charged dust; and positive ones, such as ions and
</p>
<p>positrons. Such fully ionized plasmas, however, have to be specially prepared in
</p>
<p>the laboratory in fusion devices, Q-machines, and such. Most laboratory plasmas
</p>
<p>are partially ionized and include neutral atoms. Collisions with neutrals were
</p>
<p>considered in Chap. 5 on diffusion. Plasmas that have practical applications, such
</p>
<p>as semiconductor etching and magnetic sputtering, are partially ionized. The
</p>
<p>granddaddy of three-component plasmas is the helicon plasma, which includes
</p>
<p>not only neutrals but also a magnetic field. Though helicons are complicated,
</p>
<p>they have been studied exhaustibly worldwide and are well understood.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Helicon plasmas are ionized by helicon waves, which are basically whistler
</p>
<p>waves (R waves) confined to a cylinder. Their frequencies generally lie between ωc
and the lower hybrid frequency ωl (Eq. (4.71)). To satisfy the boundary conditions
</p>
<p>on the cylinder, a second wave has to be generated near the boundary. This second
</p>
<p>wave is an electron cyclotron wave traveling obliquely to the B-field; it is called the

</p>
<p>frequency is much lower than the electron frequencies ωc and ωp. When terms in
</p>
<p>m are kept, a second wave, the TG mode, is obtained. The relation between the
</p>
<p>helicon (H) and TG waves has been clarified in papers by D. Arnush, who also
</p>
<p>wrote a computer program HELIC for the properties of these waves. Damping by
</p>
<p>electron-neutral collisions is important in the exact theory. The relation between the
</p>
<p>H and TG waves is shown in Fig. 9.11. There, k (the wave number parallel to B0) is
</p>
<p>plotted against β, the cylindrical wave number in the radial direction, for azimuthal
</p>
<p>wave number m&frac14; 1. Above a minimum, there are two solutions for k for given
n and B0, the one with large β being the TG mode.
</p>
<p>Helicon discharges have been studied experimentally in many machines with
</p>
<p>long, uniform magnetic fields of order 0.1 T. The first such machine, built by
</p>
<p>R.W. Boswell in Australia, reached a density of almost 1020 m�3 on axis. Different
</p>
<p>types of antennas have been used, the most efficient being helical ones matching the
</p>
<p>helicity of m&frac14; +1 waves obeying Eq. (9.46). For reasons not well understood,
m&frac14;�1 waves rotating in the opposite direction do not propagate as well. The
coupling of radiofrequency (RF) energy from the antenna to the plasma has been
</p>
<p>found to involve parametric instabilities. Instabilities such as the drift-wave insta-
</p>
<p>bility (Fig. 6.14) have been studied in helicon discharges. Magnetic confinement of
</p>
<p>electrons (but not of argon ions, which have Larmor orbits larger than the discharge
</p>
<p>radius), combined with efficient antenna coupling, enables helicons to achieve

<p>overcome this, arrays of short helicon discharges with permanent magnets have

</p>
<p>The phase velocity of helicon waves along B is usually comparable to the
velocities of &ldquo;primary&rdquo; electrons. . . those that do the ionization. This fact gave
</p>
<p>rise to a hypothesis that helicons accelerate the ionizing electrons by inverse
</p>
<p>Landau damping. However, measurements of electron velocity distributions
</p>
<p>showed no such population of fast electrons. It turns out that most of the RF energy
</p>
<p>goes into the TG mode near the radial boundary, where the antenna is; and only a
</p>
<p>small amount goes directly into the helicon mode, which peaks near the axis. The
</p>
<p>TG wave then couples to helicon waves to form a combined TG-helicon wave. The
</p>
<p>TG wave parametrically decays into electron cyclotron waves, as mentioned above,
</p>
<p>and the latter heats the electrons by collisional damping. Though the TG wave is an
</p>
<p>essential part of the RF coupling, it is not easily detected because it is normally
</p>
<p>localized to a thin layer near the surface. By lowering the B-field to thicken the
</p>
<p>layer, and measuring the RF current rather than the RF B-field, the TG wave can be
</p>
<p>detected, as shown in Fig. 9.13. The current profile shows large peaks due to the TG
</p>
<p>mode, but these are not seen in the B-field profile.

<p>where the B-fields of the sun and the earth collide, and, on the night side, the
</p>
<p>magnetotail, where reconnection takes place (Fig. 8.31). The sun has important
</p>
<p>plasma effects in its prominences, flares, and sunspots. The outer planets have
</p>
<p>plasma in their atmospheres and rings. Space plasma physics is the study of these
</p>
<p>plasmas in the solar system. Plasma astrophysics, on the other hand, concerns
</p>
<p>plasmas in the rest of the universe. Galaxies contain plasmas in stars, gas clouds,
</p>
<p>and black holes. Pulsars, quasars, and active galactic nuclei are all astrophysical
</p>
<p>plasmas, some with extreme properties. Neutron stars, for instance, have densities
</p>
<p>of order 4� 1017 kg/m3. A sugar-cube sized piece (1 cm3) of this material would
weigh as much as 1.3 million Eiffel towers.
</p>
<p>Auroras are produced by ions and electrons of energies of about 100&ndash;1000 eV
</p>
<p>which reach down to altitudes of about 100 km. They excite the oxygen and

<p>nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere, giving off green and brown light from oxygen
</p>
<p>and blue and purple light from nitrogen. Striking displays of Aurora Borealis are
</p>
<p>observed in northern latitudes. Aurora Australis also occurs in Antarctica but is seen
</p>
<p>mostly by penguins. In outer space all that we can see must be in the plasma state,
</p>
<p>but this is only a tiny fraction of a universe containing dark energy, dark matter, and
</p>
<p>black holes. Nonetheless, astrophysics cannot be studied without the language of
</p>
<p>plasma physics.
</p>
<p>9.7 Atmospheric-Pressure Plasmas
</p>
<p>When a voltage is applied between two electrodes in air, a spark will form between
</p>
<p>the electrodes, forming a plasma, when the voltage is high enough. This breakdown,
</p>
<p>studied in 1889 by F. Paschen, was perhaps the first plasma experiment. The
</p>
<p>breakdown voltage depends on the gas, the pressure p, and the distance
</p>
<p>d between the electrodes. Figure 9.14 shows this relationship in a modern experi-
</p>
<p>ment in argon, where contaminants such as moisture are absent. When pd is small,
</p>
<p>electrons&rsquo; mean free paths are longer than d, and large voltages are required to
</p>
<p>accelerate ions to energies that can release secondary electrons from the surface.
</p>
<p>When pd is large, electrons lose energy in collisions with the neutral gas, and the
</p>
<p>voltage rises again. Thus there is a minimum in the Paschen curve. After breakdown
</p>
<p>between parallel plates, the current is not uniform but tends to flow in streamers,
</p>
<p>each reaching its own equilibrium.
</p>
<p>In such an equilibrium, each time an ion strikes the negative plate (the cathode),
</p>
<p>γ electrons are released, γ being the secondary electron emission coefficient. These
</p>
<p>electrons are accelerated by the sheath into the plasma and collide with neutrals to
</p>
<p>form new electron-ion pairs. Each new ion will strike the cathode to release more
</p>
<p>secondary electrons, thus creating an avalanche. The density will exponentiate. Let
</p>
<p>α be the probability for an ionizing collision in a unit distance. Clearly α is
</p>
<p>proportional to 1/λmfp, where λmfp is the mean free path for ionization. One electron
</p>
<p>will generate eαd ion-electron pairs in a distance d. Upon colliding with the cathode,

<p>two regimes of RF discharges, a low-current and a high-current regime, with a
</p>
<p>discontinuous jump between the two.
</p>
<p>9.7.1 Dielectric Barrier Discharges
</p>
<p>To prevent sparking at atmospheric pressures, a dielectric barrier can be inserted
</p>
<p>between the two electrodes. In Fig. 9.15, the electrodes are covered with insulating
</p>
<p>dielectric, and high-voltage pulses create the plasma by capacitive coupling. In
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.16, a dielectric barrier separates the electrodes, but the E-field extends into
</p>
<p>the space above to ionize the plasma. The substrate to be treated is passed horizon-
</p>
<p>tally through the plasma.
</p>
<p>Dielectric barrier discharges are used in xenon lamps and for the pixels in plasma
</p>
<p>display panels (TV screens), for instance.

<p>Plasma Applications
</p>
<p>10.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The effect of plasmas had been noticed as early as 1901, when Marconi found that
</p>
<p>radio waves could cross the Atlantic in spite of the curvature of the earth. We now
</p>
<p>know that the waves were reflected by the ionosphere. The study of plasmas
</p>
<p>probably began with Irving Langmuir&rsquo;s experiments on sheaths in 1928, and it
</p>
<p>was he who coined the name plasma in a blood-free context. Practical use of plasmas
</p>
<p>began in the late 1940s with E.O. Lawrence&rsquo;s invention of the calutron (named for
</p>
<p>the University of California) for the separation of U235 from U238 for use in atomic
</p>
<p>bombs. It was the effort to tame the H-bomb into a steady source of electricity&mdash;
</p>
<p>hydrogen fusion&mdash;that spawned modern plasma physics. More on that later.
</p>
<p>Today, many objects used in everyday life are made or treated with plasmas.
</p>
<p>These are not the fully ionized plasmas needed for fusion but are partially ionized
</p>
<p>plasmas with electron temperatures below about 4 eV, the so-called low-tempera-
</p>
<p>ture plasmas. About 12 % of electricity generated in the U.S. is used for lighting,
</p>
<p>and over 60 % of lamps involve low-temperature plasmas. Fluorescent lights use an
</p>
<p>argon or neon plasma containing mercury to generate invisible ultraviolet light,
</p>
<p>which then excites a phosphor coating that glows visibly. Fluorescents are being
</p>

<p>medicine, plasmas are used for sterilization and for hardening or knee implants by
</p>
<p>ion implantation, for instance. The subject of plasma chemistry has been developed
</p>
<p>for these applications. All lasers contain plasmas, ranging from the huge megajoule
</p>
<p>lasers at Livermore in the U.S., in Osaka in Japan, and at Bordeaux in France, to the
</p>
<p>laser pointers used in lectures.
</p>
<p>Many phenomena in basic physics either involve plasmas or may involve plasmas
</p>
<p>when finally solved. Lightning strikes are gas discharges between charged clouds or
</p>
<p>between a cloud and ground. Ball lightning is a glowing sphere of plasma that is on
</p>
<p>the ground and lasts many seconds. Because of its unpredictability, it is unexplained.
</p>
<p>The geodynamo inside the earth that creates its magnetic field involves motions of
</p>
<p>liquids, but probably not gaseous plasmas. The BICEP2 experiment (Background
</p>
<p>Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization) seeks to find evidence of primordial
</p>
<p>gravitational waves from the Big Bang in the cosmic microwave background. Dust is
</p>
<p>believed to be involved. Dusty plasmas have been added to this edition.

<p>10.2 Fusion Energy
</p>
<p>All of the world&rsquo;s energy depends on the sun. Our fossil fuels come from trees that
</p>
<p>grew in sunlight millions of years ago. Sunlight causes evaporation andmakes clouds,
</p>
<p>and the rain or snow from them gives us hydropower. To minimize the CO2 released
</p>
<p>by burning coal, oil, or gas, efforts are made to develop solar and wind power, both of
</p>
<p>which derive energy from the sun. The temperature in the sun&rsquo;s interior is about 1 keV.
</p>
<p>At this temperature hydrogen atoms live for a million years before they fuse into
</p>
<p>helium to release energy. What if we can make our own miniature sun on Earth? We
</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t wait amillion years, sowemust increase the temperature to speed up the process.
</p>
<p>We can also increase the inertia in a head-on collision with heavier isotopes: deute-
</p>
<p>rium (D) with one proton and one neutron, and tritium (T) with one proton and two
</p>
<p>neutrons. The inertia has to overcome the electric repulsion of ions with like charges.
</p>
<p>For the sun, Hans Bethe invented the carbon cycle, in which protons can be made to
</p>
<p>fuse in a series of reactions involving carbon, each of which requires less energy.
</p>
<p>Better carbon cycles have been found since then, but no one has found a cycle that can
</p>
<p>work on our time scales. One might think that we could accelerate deuterons in a
</p>
<p>particle accelerator and put a solid piece of tritium ice in the beam, but thatwon&rsquo;t work
</p>
<p>because the deuterons losemore energy in off-angle scatters than they gain in head-on
</p>
<p>fusion collisions. There are two main ways to recover the energy from D&ndash;T fusion
</p>
<p>collisions: magnetic confinement, and inertial fusion.
</p>
<p>10.2.1 Magnetic Fusion
</p>
<p>By trapping a plasma in a magnetic field, the ions and electrons are in thermal
</p>
<p>equilibrium with Maxwellian distributions, so that the energy gained or lost in
</p>
<p>elastic collisions is returned to the thermal distribution. Only a few collisions result
</p>
<p>356 10 Plasma Applications</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>in fusion. The idea is to create a 50&ndash;50 % DT plasma at around 30 keV so that there
</p>
<p>are enough high-energy ions in the tail of the distribution to fuse, generating more
</p>
<p>than the energy used to create the plasma. Since the plasma is in thermal equilib-
</p>
<p>rium, these are called thermonuclear reactions. There are other nuclei besides D
</p>
<p>and T that can be used; the principal reactions are:
</p>
<p>D&thorn; T ! α&thorn; n&thorn; 17:6MeV
D&thorn; D ! 3He&thorn; n&thorn; 3:27MeV
D&thorn; D ! T&thorn; p&thorn; 4:05MeV
D&thorn; 3He ! α&thorn; p&thorn; 18:34MeV
D&thorn; 6Li ! 2α&thorn; 22:4MeV
p&thorn; 7Li ! 2α&thorn; 17:2MeV
p&thorn; 6Li ! α&thorn; 3He&thorn; 4:0MeV
p&thorn; 11B ! 3α&thorn; 8:7MeV
</p>
<p>Here p is a proton and n a neutron. The two D&ndash;D reactions occur with about equal
</p>
<p>probability, but one of them yields a neutron. Since thick shielding would be required
</p>
<p>to protect personnel from neutrons, aneutronic reactions are much preferred. Fur-
</p>
<p>thermore, neutrons not only require shielding but they also carry most of the energy,
</p>
<p>which must be captured as heat to be used in a steam turbine to produce electricity.
</p>
<p>The D&ndash;3He reaction is aneutronic, but 3He does not occur naturally. It is produced in
</p>
<p>the first D&ndash;D reaction, which is neutronic. The 6Li reactions use the 8 % isotope of
</p>
<p>lithium. The p-7Li reaction is aneutronic, but it occurs only 20 % of the time. This
</p>
<p>leaves the p-11B reaction, which is the best choice because it is entirely aneutronic
</p>
<p>and 7Li is a plentiful element. Though its reactivity is relatively low, p-11B has such
</p>
<p>promise that it is being pursued by a private enterprise. Charged products can, in
</p>
<p>principle at least, produce electricity without going through a Carnot cycle.
</p>
<p>Figure 10.1 shows the fusion probability for the various reactions. It is clear that
</p>
<p>the D&ndash;T reaction is by far the best. Shown in Fig. 10.2, the D&ndash;T reaction produces a
</p>
<p>neutron and a helium nucleus, or α-particle. The mass difference between the D+T
</p>
<p>and the resulting α + n is converted into 17.6MeV of energy by E&frac14;Mc2. Most of the
energy is carried off by the 14-MeV neutron, while the 3.5-MeV α-particle is trapped
</p>
<p>in the magnetic field which confines the plasma. This confinement is far from
</p>
<p>perfect, and the mean times for leakage of ions and of plasma energy are called
</p>
<p>respectively τp and τE. Neglecting the difference between τp and τE, we show in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.3 the required nτ product for breakeven and ignition. Breakeven occurs when
</p>
<p>the fusion energy produced is equal to that used in creating the plasma. This is called
</p>
<p>the Lawson criterion. Ignition occurs when the α-particles are trapped in the B-field
</p>
<p>long enough that they canmaintain the plasma&rsquo;s temperature without further input of
</p>
<p>energy. The Joint European Tokamak (JET) in England is, at the time of this writing,
</p>
<p>on the verge of achieving breakeven. The ITER tokamak in France (originally an
</p>
<p>acronym of International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), is designed to
</p>
<p>achieve ignition some years after it begins D&ndash;T operation in 2027.

<p>There are two principal ways to surpass the Lawson criterion: magnetic con-
</p>
<p>finement and inertial confinement. In magnetic confinement, the minimum nτ in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.3 is achieved by holding a dense plasma in a magnetic field for a time τ. In
</p>
<p>inertial confinement, a much denser plasma is held for a very short time by

<p>compressing it with a laser or other pulsed power source. We consider magnetic
</p>
<p>confinement first. Ions and electrons gyrate in Larmor orbits but are free to move
</p>
<p>along lines of B. To trap them, one can use magnetic mirrors or cusps (see Figs. 2.7,
2.8, and 2.14), or close the lines in a torus. Large mirror machines have been built
</p>
<p>with special devices to slow the loss of particles which scatter into the loss cone, but
</p>
<p>these have not been as successful as tori. In a torus, the B-field lines must not close
</p>
<p>on themselves but must randomly trace out magnetic surfaces. Instabilities then
</p>
<p>arise, such as the gravitational instability in Sect. 6.7 and the drift-wave instability
</p>
<p>in Sect. 6.8. The former is driven by centrifugal force, and the latter by the pressure
</p>
<p>gradient which must exist somewhere in a confined plasma. An ion temperature
</p>
<p>gradient instability has also been troublesome. These instabilities have been
</p>
<p>brought under control by shear in the magnetic field and other more subtle
</p>
<p>means, and it is now possible to satisfy the Lawson criterion.
</p>
<p>10.2.1.1 Pinches and Pulsed Power
</p>
<p>Inertial confinement research began with pinches. These are plasmas created with a
</p>
<p>pulsed current, whose B-field compresses the plasma to higher density until the
</p>
<p>plasma pressure is balanced by the magnetic field pressure. Figure 10.4 shows a
</p>
<p>simple z-pinch (zed-pinch in the U.K.), like the one described theoretically as early
</p>
<p>as 1934 by W.H. Bennett. This type of pinch suffers from two instabilities: a
</p>
<p>sausage instability, shown in Fig. 10.5, and a kink instability, shown in Fig. 10.6.
</p>
<p>In the sausage instability, if a bulge develops in a linear pinch, the B-field is
</p>
<p>weakened with the new field lines. The plasma pressure is then able to push the
</p>
<p>lines further out. The opposite case of a reduced radius neck developing in the
</p>
<p>plasma is shown in Fig. 10.5. In the kink instability (Fig. 10.6), a kink, or bend, in
</p>
<p>the plasma will cause the B-field to be stronger on the inside of the curve than on the
</p>
<p>outside, and the magnetic pressure difference will enhance the kink. By adding a
</p>
<p>DC magnetic field to the pinch, these instabilities can be slowed down, but such
</p>
<p>pinches could not achieve confinement times adequate for fusion.
</p>
<p>In 1952 James Tuck at Los Alamos in the U.S. made a toroidal z-pinch called the
</p>
<p>Perhapsatron. To drive the current, the plasma was threaded through an iron core
</p>
<p>and was the secondary winding of a transformer. This was one of the first toroidal
</p>
<p>experiments. In the U.K., a large toroidal &ldquo;zed-pinch&rdquo; called Zeta was built and
</p>
<p>exhibited at the 1958 Geneva conference, at which each nation showed what it had
</p>
<p>been doing while fusion was a classified subject. Neutrons were observed from Zeta
</p>
<p>which indicated that it had produced fusion reactions. However, the DT reactions
</p>
<p>were found to come from collisions on the wall, not the interior, much to the chagrin
</p>
<p>of my good friend Peter Thonemann.
</p>
<p>Z-pinch. The z-pinch is so simple that it was not easy to give up on them in spite of
their unstable nature. One solution was to drive a current through an array of
</p>
<p>hundreds of fine metal wires, as was done by T.W.L. Sanford et al. in 1995. Results
</p>
<p>from these and later wire array experiments are discussed in the context of a series
</p>
<p>10.2 Fusion Energy 359</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>of distinct physical mechanisms by Malcolm Haines et al. in 2005. The wires not
</p>
<p>only provided a hard core for the pinches, but they also stabilized the kinking in
</p>
<p>neighboring wires. Rayleigh&ndash;Taylor instabilities then made regular indentations
</p>
<p>along the linear plasmas. Related experiments were done with imploding cylindri-
</p>
<p>cal liners. Though the main purpose of these experiments was to create X-rays, a
</p>
<p>capsule containing deuterium, struck by such implosions, could produce 1010 DD
</p>
<p>fusion neutrons. A very large experiment, the Z-machine, at Sandia in New Mexico
</p>
<p>in the U.S., focused a number of these pinches onto a small wire-array target
</p>
<p>enclosing a DD-filled capsule inside a hohlraum (defined later) to produce fusion.
</p>
<p>The power to the pinches was delivered through thick coaxial &ldquo;cables&rdquo; which
</p>
<p>used demineralized (high resistivity) water as a dielectric between metal cylinders.
</p>
<p>Water has a high dielectric constant of 80. The power was stored in compact
</p>
<p>megajoule capacitor banks. The capacitors are charged in parallel, slowly, and
</p>
<p>discharged in series, fast, in order to pulse-charge the water-dielectric coaxial
</p>
<p>cables in under 1 μs. This process is shown in Fig. 10.7.
</p>
<p>A spectacular discharge on the surface of the demineralized water tank in the
</p>
<p>Z-machine is shown in Fig. 10.8. Such discharges occur only at late time in normal
</p>
<p>operation and do not affect the electrical energy delivered to the load during the
</p>
<p>main power pulse.

<p>Smaller pulsed-power systems at universities can deliver ~1 TW of power in

<p>100-ns pulses. A megajoule of energy is only the amount required to boil half a cup
</p>

</p>
<p>along with high-power lasers, represent significant advances in technology, but they
</p>
<p>do not directly relate to fusion energy. Electric power must be steady and

Theta pinch and reversed-field pinch. As shown in Fig. 10.9, a theta pinch has the
plasma current going in the theta direction. After preionization, a pulse in the theta-
</p>
<p>pinch coils drives an azimuthal current J, creating a plasma trapped in the B-field of
the coils. By Newton&rsquo;s third law, this action creates a reaction: the current J is in the
direction to produce a B-field on axis opposing the B-field of the coils. With
</p>
<p>sufficient current, the internal B-field can become larger than that from the coils,
</p>
<p>and we have a reversed-field pinch. The plasma can extend as far as the separatrix,
</p>
<p>which divides the internal field lines from those that extend beyond the coils.
</p>
<p>362 10 Plasma Applications</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The plasma is kept from sliding axially by the Jθ � Br force at its ends. At a critical
current, the B-field on axis can be zero, and we have created a β&frac14;1 plasma!
</p>
<p>The plasma in Fig. 10.9 suffers from instabilities. If the coils are long or far
</p>
<p>away, the plasma can tilt or slide in the horizontal direction. A hydromagnetic
</p>
<p>instability can occur at the ends because of the unfavorable curvature there. Though
</p>
<p>the pinch is necessarily pulsed, it lasts much longer than the instability growth time.
</p>
<p>The effect of curvature is illustrated in Fig. 10.10, where the animals represent
</p>
<p>plasma pressure from above. When the curvature is concave to the plasma, more
</p>
<p>plasma pressure can be supported, and visa versa. The curvature drift is described in
</p>
<p>Sect. 2.3.2 for a convex curvature. In Fig. 10.9, the sharp bends at the ends of the
</p>
<p>plasma are highly unstable, but fortunately the unstable fields (see Fig. 6.11) are
</p>
<p>short-circuited by the ions, which have large Larmor orbits and can cross the
</p>
<p>B-field. The finite-Larmor-radius effect was discussed in Sect. 2.4.
</p>
<p>The Taylor state. Consider now a toroidal z-pinch such as the Zeta machine
mentioned previously. The plasma is held in a toroidal B-field, and a current is driven
</p>
<p>through the plasma to produce a twist, turning the field lines into helices. It was found
</p>
<p>that, after a period of violent shaking, the plasma settled into a quiescent state.
</p>
<p>J.B. Taylor of the U.K. found that, if the helicity of the B-field is conserved, this
</p>
<p>relaxed state is a force-free, minimum energy equilibrium following the equation
</p>
<p>&nabla; � B &frac14; λB; &eth;10:5&THORN;
</p>
<p>where λ is a constant. The long derivation is omitted here, but Eq. (10.5) is an
</p>
<p>equation that occurs often in different fields of physics.
</p>
<p>10.2.1.2 Magnetic Mirrors
</p>
<p>It is possible to trap charged particles between magnetic mirrors, which reflect

<p>particles with finite velocity v&perp; perpendicular B. In Eq. (2.46) it was shown that the

</p>
<p>The end losses from a simple mirror are so large that many modifications have
</p>
<p>been made to minimize these losses. Before we get to these, consider the stability of
</p>
<p>the plasma. At the center of the mirror, the field lines are convex to the plasma, and
</p>
<p>Rayleigh&ndash;Taylor instabilities can occur. At the throats of the mirror, the field lines
</p>
<p>are concave to the plasma, providing a stabilizing effect. If the machine is long
</p>
<p>enough to hold a useful volume of plasma, however, the unstable region dominates.
</p>
<p>One way to stabilize that part is to add &ldquo;Ioffe bars&rdquo;, named after the inventor, which
</p>
<p>are four conductors carrying current in the axial direction, as shown in Fig. 10.12.
</p>
<p>The azimuthal fields from the bars, added to the mirror field, form twisted magnetic
</p>
<p>surfaces which have the minimum-B property. That is, the field strength jBj
increases in every direction, forming a magnetic well for the plasma. This is a
</p>
<p>very stable arrangement, but the plasma still leaks out the ends of the mirror. In
</p>
<p>addition, mirrors suffer from another instability, the cyclotron-ion instability.
</p>
<p>If one links the currents in the coils and the bars into a single conductor, a &ldquo;baseball
</p>

<p>consisting of several mirrors in series. For instance, one mirror could have
</p>
<p>minimum-B stabilization, while the end mirror could be a short one with a large
</p>
<p>mirror ratio for confinement. The main interest in mirrors was the possibility of
</p>
<p>direct conversion of plasma energy into electricity without going through a heat
</p>
<p>cycle. As ions collide, some will enter the loss cone and escape. These will be
</p>
<p>accelerated in the z direction because as B decreases, the conservation of μ means
</p>
<p>that v&perp; will decrease, and hence v|| must increase. An ion beam will be ejected, as
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 10.16, and it will be neutralized by electrons, which can escape easily
</p>
<p>by their frequent collisions. The ion beam will be sorted by energy and collected by
</p>
<p>a series of bins, as seen in Fig. 10.17, with the more energetic ones going farther
</p>
<p>before drifting sideways. Thus, the bins provide a DC current. Since the ions enter
</p>
<p>the bins at low energy, little heat is lost; and this would be an efficient way to
</p>
<p>convert fusion energy directly to electricity.
</p>
<p>Mirrors are fueled by tangential injection of ions at the midplane. Mirrors are of
</p>
<p>course not immune to instability. In addition to the flute interchange instability in the
</p>
<p>central cell, there are instabilities driven by the anisotropy of the distribution func-
</p>
<p>tions, which have an empty loss cone. For instance, there is an Alfvén ion-cyclotron

<p>instability. Compared with toroidal devices, mirrors do not confine plasmas as well
</p>
<p>and are not as suitable for fusion. However, they are useful for industrial applications
</p>
<p>where confinement is not as important as the ejected beams. They can also produce
</p>
<p>high-β plasmas for experiments not possible in low-β devices.
</p>
<p>10.2.1.3 Reversed-Field Configurations
</p>
<p>The possibility of creating a high-β plasma spawned a number of large experiments
</p>
<p>on reversed-field configurations (RFCs). An RFC is a high-β plasma requiring no
</p>
<p>toroidal field or conducting boundaries. A diagram of an RFC is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.18. Though the plasma is pulsed, many instabilities can grow faster than
</p>
<p>the pulse length. At the ends of the plasma is a region of bad curvature where
</p>
<p>gravitational instabilities are stabilized by finite ion Larmor radius rLi. This is not
</p>
<p>simple, since rLi varies rapidly in the nonuniform field. The most dangerous
</p>
<p>instability is thought to be the n&frac14; 2 tilt mode, shown in Fig. 10.19, where n is the
azimuthal mode number. There is also an n&frac14; 1 rotational instability. Much of the
work on FRCs is theoretical, but these instabilities have been observed. The plasma
</p>
<p>lasts microseconds, and the total temperature KTe+KTi can reach 800 eV.
</p>
<p>In the confined region of Fig. 10.18, plasma pressure is needed to balance the
</p>
<p>magnetic pressure. It can be shown that the average β is given by
</p>
<p>βh i &frac14; 1 � &frac12; rs=rw&eth; &THORN;2, where rw is the wall radius. Since rs/rw� 1, hβi must be
&gt;&frac12;, and this is an intrinsically high-β device.
</p>
<p>FRCs are translatable; that is, they can be pushed magnetically from one
</p>
<p>chamber to another. For fusion purposes, an FRC can, in principle, be translated
</p>
<p>into chamber with a DC magnetic field, a conducting wall for stabilization, and
</p>
<p>even &ldquo;blankets&rdquo; for capturing the neutrons and converting their energy into heat.
</p>
<p>10.2.1.4 Stellarators
</p>
<p>Confinement of plasma in a torus eliminates endlosses but introduces new prob-
</p>
<p>lems. It is convenient to classify tori is by their aspect ratios. In a circular torus with
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.17 Conceptual scheme for direct conversion of ion energy to electricity
</p>
<p>368 10 Plasma Applications</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>circular cross section, we can define R as the major radius and a as the minor radius,
</p>
<p>as shown in Fig. 10.20. The aspect ratio is defined as R/a. Proceeding from large to
</p>
<p>small aspect ratio, we start with stellarators.
</p>
<p>Toroidal confinement began around 1951 when Lyman Spitzer, Jr., and Martin
</p>
<p>Schwarzschild built the figure-8 shaped Model A-1 machine at Princeton Univer-
</p>
<p>sity. Being an astronomer, Spitzer named it a stellarator. The idea of a figure-8 came
</p>
<p>to Spitzer during a long ride on a ski lift at Garmisch-Partenkirchen. This was a
</p>
<p>solution to the problem of vertical drifts in a torus, as shown in Fig. 10.21. The
</p>

<p>problem is this. In a torus B must be stronger on the inside (near the major axis, to
the left here) than on the outside because the field lines are crowded together there.
</p>
<p>This causes the Larmor radii to be larger on one side of each orbit than on the other,
</p>
<p>giving rise to the grad-B drift [Eq. (2.24)], which depends on the sign of the charge.
</p>
<p>The electrons drift upwards, and the ions downwards, creating a vertical E-field.
</p>
<p>The resulting E�B drift is always outward, causing a loss of plasma.
To cancel this drift, one can twist the torus into a figure-8 shape, as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.22. As a particle follows a field line, its E�B drift is towards the outside in
one half, and back towards the inside in the other half. A demonstration model of a
</p>
<p>figure-8 stellarator is shown in Fig. 10.23. This was built for the Atoms for Peace
</p>
<p>conference in Geneva in 1958, an event at which all nations revealed their secret
</p>
<p>work on fusion. An electron gun could be inserted into the model to accelerate
</p>
<p>electrons that traced out the field lines. An A-2 stellarator (fondly called the Etude)
</p>
<p>was operated by Kees Bol. The B-1 stellarator was run by the author in 1954,
</p>
<p>showing that electrons (not plasma) could be confined for millions of traverses
</p>
<p>around the 8, in spite of errors in the fabrication of the coils. A B-2 stellarator,
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 10.24, was shipped to Geneva also, together with its power supplies
</p>
<p>and controls so that it could be operated normally. Meanwhile, T. Stix and
</p>
<p>R. Palladino at Princeton constructed a figure-8 stellarator in the form of a square,
</p>
<p>which they named B-64, or 82.

<p>It was soon realized that the twist needed to cancel the vertical drifts could be
</p>
<p>produced without a figure-8 machine. What was needed was another set of coils
</p>
<p>wound helically around the torus, as shown in Fig. 10.25. This method had the
</p>
<p>additional advantage that the helical current could be varied. Th B-series of
</p>
<p>machines was replaced by the C-stellarator, a much larger machine with two
</p>
<p>important innovations: ion cyclotron heating, and divertors for capturing the escap-
</p>
<p>ing plasma. Previously, the plasma was heated only by ohmic heating, in which a
</p>
<p>current was induced around the torus by a transformer of which the plasma was the
</p>
<p>secondary winding. Since the plasma has a resistance caused by collisions of the

<p>current-carrying electrons with ions, it was heated by the I2R losses. The current
</p>
<p>created a poloidal B-field so that the field lines went through a poloidal angle ι (iota)
</p>
<p>each time they went around the torus the long way. A kink instability occurs when
</p>
<p>iota exceeds 2π. This is called the Kruskal-Shafranov limit. These difficulties have
</p>
<p>been overcome in tokamaks, which differ from stellarators in that the poloidal field
</p>
<p>is generated by the plasma current itself, and not by external coils. Modern
</p>
<p>stellarators use electron-cyclotron, lower-hybrid, and neutral-beam heating, as in
</p>
<p>tokamaks, and do not depend on ohmic heating.
</p>
<p>Stellarators have been evolving since 1951, and variations with names such as
</p>
<p>torsatron, heliotron, heliac, and helias have been built in different countries. The
</p>
<p>most spectacular of these, the LHD (Large Helical Device) in Japan, is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.26. The entire vacuum chamber was shaped to follow the magnetic field. In
</p>
<p>Germany, D. Pfirsch and H. Schlüter combined the toroidal and helical coils into a
</p>
<p>series of 20 planar and 50 non-planar coils, several of each shape, to form the
</p>
<p>Wendelstein 7-X, shown in Fig. 10.27. This machine is under construction in

<p>Greifswald, Germany. As with the LHD, the vacuum chamber is not round. To
</p>
<p>make room for all these coils, stellarators must have large aspect ratio.
</p>
<p>With the large advances in the development and understanding of tokamaks,
</p>
<p>stellarators are no longer preferred for plasma confinement in fusion experiments.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, stellarators have advantages which may make themmore suitable than
</p>
<p>tokamaks for reactors. For instance, their poloidal field is created by helical
</p>
<p>windings and is not dependent on the plasma current, whose shape is not in direct
</p>
<p>control. Stellarators are also immune from &ldquo;disruptions&rdquo;, which terminate tokamak
</p>
<p>plasmas unexpectedly and are not yet well understood.
</p>
<p>10.2.1.5 Tokamaks
</p>
<p>Invented in Russia, TOKAMAK is a Russian acronym for toroidal chamber with an
</p>
<p>axial magnetic field. Since tokamaks have become the favored form of toroidal
</p>
<p>fusion devices, so much is known about their behavior that only a few general
</p>
<p>characteristics can be given here. In tokamak literature, the rotational transform ι
</p>
<p>(iota) of stellarators is replaced by its reciprocal q. Thus, a field line that comes back
</p>
<p>to the same poloidal position after going around the torus twice the long way has
</p>
<p>ι&frac14;&frac12; or q&frac14; 2. A typical q profile is shown in Fig. 10.28. The rational-q surfaces
have field lines which close upon themselves and are special. The region q&lt; 1
corresponds to ι&gt; 1 and is unstable. In tokamaks this instability has the form of
sawtooth oscillations, as shown in Fig. 10.29 for Ti and Te vs. time at q&frac14; 1. As the
temperature rises at the center, the resistivity lowers, and the current density
</p>
<p>increases, thus driving the temperature higher until the configuration can no longer
</p>
<p>be sustained. Then the sawtooth crashes, ejecting a hot plasma outwards. Unlike
</p>
<p>stellarators, tokamaks have a self-organized plasma that generates its own behavior
</p>
<p>to achieve an equilibrium.
</p>
<p>It is clear that the profile q(r) should depend on the current profile J(r). An
</p>
<p>example of this variation is shown in Fig. 10.30. It is seen that more peaked J(r)&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>give higher q(a)&rsquo;s. The particles, both ions and electrons, travel in interesting orbits
</p>
<p>on these magnetic surfaces.

<p>Islands and Bananas
</p>
<p>At the radii where q is a rational number, the field lines form magnetic islands. An
</p>
<p>example of this is shown in Fig. 10.31. In the islands, a particle will hop from one
</p>
<p>island to the next, eventually returning to the initial island in a different position. Its
</p>
<p>intersections with this cross section will trace out the islands. However, some
</p>
<p>particles can&rsquo;t go all the way around the torus. Consider the trajectory shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.32. Since the B-field is stronger on the inside of the torus (nearer the major
</p>
<p>axis) than on the outside, a particle with small v|| can be mirror-trapped and reflected
</p>
<p>back. Projected onto a cross-sectional plane, this orbit resembles that in Fig. 10.33
</p>
<p>and is appropriately called a banana orbit. These orbits can cause enhanced diffusion
</p>

<p>of plasma. Normally, a collision can result in a random-walk step the size of a Larmor
</p>
<p>diameter (Fig. 5.17); but now a particle can jump from one banana to another. The
</p>
<p>result is that diffusion depends no longer on the toroidal field Bϕ, but on the weaker
</p>
<p>poloidal field Bθ. These effects contribute to &ldquo;neoclassical diffusion&rdquo; (see Fig. 5.22).
</p>
<p>An effect associated with bananas is the Ware Pinch, illustrated in Fig. 10.34.
</p>
<p>Particles in banana orbits have an Eϕ�Bp drift which is always inward, just as in a
</p>

<p>linear z-pinch. Thus, bananas tend to move inward, countering collisional diffusion
</p>
<p>outward. The inward velocity of a Ware pinch is given by
</p>
<p>vWare &frac14; 2� 0:5&eth; &THORN;A�1=2Eϕ=Bθ; &eth;10:8&THORN;
</p>
<p>where A is the aspect ratio, and the range covers details such as Zeff.
</p>
<p>Bootstrap Current
</p>
<p>Another interesting effect in tokamaks is the bootstrap current, a current that arises,
</p>
<p>enhancing the toroidal current, as the plasma diffuses outward, as if the tokamak is
</p>
<p>pulling itself up &ldquo;by its own bootstraps&rdquo;. This expression, originated around 1781,
</p>
<p>means to overcome an impediment without outside help. Figure 10.35a is a
</p>
<p>reminder of Eq. (2.17) showing the velocity of its guiding center when a particle
</p>
<p>is pushed by a force perpendicular to B:

</p>
<p>In Fig. 10.35b, the black arrows show the outward pressure force on the plasma in a
</p>
<p>monotonic density profile. This causes the azimuthal drift of electrons, which is
</p>
<p>innocuous. The toroidal current generates an azimuthal Bp (blue arrows). The
electrons drift in this field Bp, driven by &nabla;p, is the bootstrap current. It is always
in the same direction as the main current and hence adds it. The bootstrap current
</p>
<p>can be as large as 70&ndash;90 % of the total current, and the tokamak is really pulling
</p>
<p>itself up by its own bootstraps.

<p>The H-Mode
</p>
<p>In 1982, Friedrich (Fritz) Wagner was heating the ASDEX tokamak with neutral
</p>
<p>beams when, at a certain threshold power, the plasma density suddenly doubled,
</p>
<p>and instabilities quieted down. This is now called the H (high)-mode. The density
</p>
<p>and temperature of the plasma did not fall to near zero at the edge but stopped
</p>
<p>falling at a pedestal level (Fig. 10.36a) as if there were a transport barrier there
</p>
<p>(Fig. 10.36b). Later experiments showed that there is a highly sheared azimuthal
</p>
<p>flow at the barrier which prevented normal outward diffusion of plasma. The
</p>
<p>plasma was instead lost in bursts called ELMs (Edge Localized Modes), a name
</p>
<p>which suggests that these were not well understood. The H-mode density is a factor
</p>
<p>2&ndash;3 above previous values, now called the L (low)-mode. Other large tokamaks
</p>
<p>have also produced the H-mode, and now they all operate with it.
</p>
<p>ELMs are thought to be &ldquo;peeling-ballooning&rdquo; modes driven by the large boot-
</p>
<p>strap current caused by the sharp pressure gradient in the thin pedestal layer.
</p>
<p>Peeling is a form of the kink mode. Ballooning is a bubbling out of the plasma
</p>
<p>into a weaker field, where extrusion can grow more easily. The pedestal raises the β
</p>
<p>of the plasma, and thus the fusion power, which increases as β2. The H-mode was an
</p>
<p>entirely unanticipated gift of nature. The conditions can be adjusted so that these
</p>
<p>large outward bursts of plasma are replaced by a stream of small bursts, called
</p>
<p>grassy ELMs. Even better, it is possible eliminate ELMs altogether. This has been
</p>
<p>achieved in the ASDEX Upgrade in Germany and the DIII-D in the U.S. with
</p>
<p>neutral beams counter-injected relative to the plasma current. Figure 10.37 shows
</p>
<p>the ELM activity as seen by the oscillations in the deuterium α-line Dα. As the
</p>
<p>power is raised, the tokamak goes from the L-mode into the H-mode. At first, there
</p>
<p>are ELMs, but a long period ELM-free H-mode ensues. The average density,
</p>
<p>however, is low in the ELM-free mode, as seen in Fig. 10.38. Apparently, the
</p>
<p>radial flux at high density cannot be transported to the open field lines leading to the
</p>
<p>divertor without ELMs.

<p>D-Shapes and Divertors
</p>
<p>A toroidal plasma suffers from instabilities and other particle loss mechanisms that
</p>
<p>do not occur in cylinders. Since these effects are caused by the fact that one side of
</p>
<p>the plasma is closer to the major axis than the other, we can increase the volume of
</p>
<p>the plasma harmlessly by making the tokamak taller rather than wider. This has led
</p>
<p>to tokamaks with D-shaped cross sections, which are now commonly adopted. An
</p>
<p>example is shown in Fig. 10.39. At the top and bottom of the plasma there are
</p>
<p>&ldquo;divertors&rdquo;, which capture the plasma exhaust. The confined part of the plasma is

<p>enclosed by the last closed flux surface, called the Scrape Off Layer. The surfaces
</p>
<p>outside of that capture the escaping plasma and lead it into the divertors, where high
</p>
<p>temperature materials and heavy cooling condense the hot plasma. Figure 10.40
</p>
<p>shows the elongated chamber of the JET tokamak in England, which has been
</p>
<p>operating since 1983. Figure 10.41 shows a water-cooled divertor designed for a
</p>
<p>future tokamak.
</p>
<p>The Density Limit
</p>
<p>In assembling data from numerous tokamaks, M. Greenwald found that their
</p>
<p>average plasma density always fell below a hard limit which was proportional to
</p>
<p>the power input. This is shown in Fig. 10.42. It was thought that as the power was
</p>
<p>raised, the wall was bombarded by escaping ions, thus releasing high-Z impurities
</p>
<p>near the boundary. These would radiate and cool the plasma, increasing the
</p>
<p>resistivity there and thus changing the current profile into an unstable form.
</p>
<p>However, the density limit does not depend on the impurity level or the power. If
</p>
<p>the density is slowly raised in the H-mode until it reaches the limit, the H-mode
</p>
<p>disrupts unstably into the L-mode. If the density is allowed fall slowly, it decays at
</p>
<p>the rate that keeps the discharge at marginal stability. The density limit is not well
</p>
<p>understood.

being in the microwave range, can be carried in waveguides and injected with a
</p>
<p>horn without requiring an internal antenna.
</p>
<p>ECRH power, of order 100 GHz, is produced by gyrotrons, which produce
electron cyclotron radiation by injecting an electron beam to gyrate in a strong
</p>
<p>magnetic field. A picture of a gyrotron is shown in Fig. 10.43. The magnet is at the
</p>
<p>bottom, and the top part collects the depleted beam. A bank of these, at 170 GHz
</p>
<p>and 1 MW, will be used in ITER. As shown in Problem 4.47, the cyclotron
</p>
<p>resonance can be reached only from the inside of the torus, where space in the
</p>
<p>central column is at a premium. For this reason, ECRH is often applied at 2ωc.
</p>
<p>Large tokamaks are mainly heated by the injection of neutral atoms (NBI) which
can penetrate into the interior of the plasma before being ionized. These atoms must
</p>
<p>therefore have a large injection energy, typically hundreds of keV. For instance, the
</p>
<p>JT-60U tokamak in Japan has developed a 500-keV, 22-A ion source for an injector.
</p>
<p>To make a neutral beam one can start with a positive ion and add an electron, or
</p>
<p>start with a negative ion and strip an electron, which is easier. Neutral beam
</p>
<p>injectors typically start with negative deuterium ions (D�), which are then passed
through a gas such as lithium or cesium to be turned into neutrals. Neutral beams
</p>
<p>can be injected radially or, usually, tangentially in the same direction as the
</p>
<p>tokamak current.
</p>
<p>Figure 10.44 shows the DIII-D tokamak at General Atomic in San Diego,
</p>
<p>California. The two large cylinders on the left are the neutral beam injectors. A
</p>
<p>beam dump on the far side captures the un-ionized beam. Neutral beam injectors
</p>
<p>tend to be larger than the tokamak itself and to dominate the laboratory. When

<p>neutral beams are injected in the direction of the tokamak current, they contribute to
</p>
<p>that current when ionized. Varying the angle of injection affords a way to control
</p>
<p>the current profile. This is called non-inductive current drive, since it is steady-state
</p>
<p>and does not involve pulsing a transformer.
</p>
<p>Electron cyclotron current drive is another way to achieve steady-state operation
</p>
<p>of a tokamak. To do this, waves at a frequency corresponding to ωc somewhere in
</p>
<p>the interior of the plasma are injected from the inside of the torus. We can use
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.36 if we add a line representing the injected ω. If an X-wave is sent in from
</p>
<p>the outside of the torus, ω lies to the right, and the whole diagram moves to the right
</p>
<p>towards ω as ωp increases. The wave will meet the cutoff at ωR and be reflected. But
</p>
<p>if the wave is injected from inside the torus, where ωc is larger than ωL, it can travel
</p>
<p>to the radius where ω&frac14;ωc and give electron cyclotron current drive with its
z component. The space in the central column very limited, and the need to inject
</p>
<p>from the inside is problematic.

<p>Disruptions
</p>
<p>Tokamaks are subject to catastrophic events known as disruptions. There are many
</p>
<p>possible causes for this loss of confinement, but it is a global instability that causes a
</p>
<p>thermal quench&mdash;a sudden cooling of the plasma. The resistivity then increases, and
</p>
<p>the toroidal voltage can then accelerate electron runaways to MeVs. Large &ldquo;halo&rdquo;
</p>
<p>currents flow poloidally, partly in the plasma and partly in the wall. Large J�B forces
are induced in the walls as J decreases. The D-shaped plasma &ldquo;falls&rdquo; vertically, as
shown in Fig. 10.45. It is sometimes possible to anticipate a disruption when oscilla-
</p>
<p>tions appear in Mirnov pickup coils near the edge. In that case, the disruption can be
</p>
<p>prevented by injection of a neutral gas such as He or Ne through a fast valve. It is clear
</p>
<p>that disruptions must be avoided in a reactor, and this can be done by operating the
</p>
<p>tokamak below its maximum power. With superconducting magnets, tokamaks can
</p>
<p>run almost steady state. The EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Toka-
</p>
<p>mak) in China can run pulses as long as 1000 s without disrupting.
</p>
<p>10.2.1.6 Spheromaks and Spherical Tokamaks
</p>
<p>When the aspect ratio of a tokamak is reduce to the order of unity, the machine
</p>
<p>becomes a spherical tokamak. If the central column is removed and the plasma is
</p>
<p>injected, it forms a self-organized structure called a spheromak. A smoke ring is an
</p>
<p>example of a self-organized structure. Instabilities, especially the kink instabilities,
</p>
<p>are suppressed at low aspect ratios, probably because of the short connection length
</p>
<p>between good and bad curvature regions.

<p>10.3 Plasma Accelerators
</p>
<p>In Fig. 7.17 we saw how a particle can be accelerated by a wave, thus causing
</p>
<p>damping of the wave. In 1979 John Dawson, in a paper with T. Tajima, proposed
</p>

<p>nuclear physics and the structure of matter. Originally, Dawson envisioned accel-
</p>
<p>erating particles traveling at an angle to a wave, as shown in Figs. 10.50, 10.51, thus
</p>
<p>gaining velocity faster than that of the wave. This idea spawned many experiments,
</p>
<p>principally in the U.S., Japan, and England, to develop a new type of accelerator. So
</p>
<p>far, only straight acceleration at zero angle has been tried.
</p>
<p>There were two early ideas on plasma accelerators: beatwave and wakefield. In
</p>
<p>the beatwave case, two lines of a laser at (ω0, k0) and (ω2, k2) are set to resonate at
</p>
<p>ωp, which is assumed to be much smaller than the laser frequencies. The beat
</p>
<p>frequencies are
</p>
<p>ω1 &frac14; ω0 � ω2 � Δω &rsquo; ω p
k1 &frac14; k0 � k2 � Δk � k p &eth;10:10&THORN;
</p>
<p>This excites a plasma wave with a phase velocity vϕ&frac14;ω1/k1�ωp/kp. Since plasma
waves in a cold plasma do not depend on wavelength [Eq. (4.30)], kp is allowed to

<p>and similarly for ω2. In the usual limit ωp�ω0 so that vg0&frac14; dω0/dk0�Δω/Δk,
we see from Eqs. (10.10 and 10.11) that vg0 of the light waves is nearly equal to
</p>
<p>the vϕ of the plasma wave. This assures that a laser pulse can continue to push
</p>
<p>particles trapped in the plasma wave over long distances.

m3 for the 9.6-μm line, and nc� 1.29� 1025/m3 for the 9.3-μm line. The beat
frequency of 3� 1012/s between the 10.6- and 9.6-μm lines corresponds to the
plasma frequency at n&frac14; 1.1� 1023/m3. This is a high density that can be produced
by a pulsed plasma or even by the laser beams themselves. Beat waves were
</p>
<p>produced at UCLA in 1985, and acceleration of electrons by beat waves in 1993.
</p>
<p>Figure 10.52 shows two oscillations differing in frequency by 5 % and their beat
</p>
<p>wave, which has 20 times the wavelength, according to Eq. (10.10).
</p>
<p>In wakefield acceleration, plasma waves are excited by a short pulse of electrons
</p>
<p>or photons. The waves have plasma frequency fp and wavelength λ� c/fp, since
drive pulse travels at v� c. If the plasma wave has sufficient amplitude, electrons
will be swept up by the wave and accelerated to v� c, gaining mass rather than
velocity in the relativistic limit. It is also possible to inject electrons in the right
</p>
<p>phase by photoemission from a solid with a pulsed laser synchronized with the
</p>
<p>wave (Fig. 10.53).
</p>
<p>The relativity factor γ of a plasma wave can be expressed simply in terms of ωp:
</p>
<p>γ � 1� v2ϕ=c2
� ��1=2
</p>
<p>&eth;10:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>Using Eqs. (10.12) and (10.13), we have

</p>
<p>Real experiments involve beams, not the one-dimensional, infinite plane waves
</p>
<p>described so far. In two dimensions, one finds that in addition to regions of accel-
</p>
<p>eration and deceleration, the wave has regions of focusing and defocusing. As
</p>
<p>computers advanced, it was possible to do cell-by-cell computer simulation to see
</p>
<p>the nonlinear development. One result is shown in Fig. 10.54. Here, a very short,
</p>
<p>intense laser or electron pulse is sent through a plasma. The ponderomotive force of
</p>
<p>the pulse ejects all the electrons, leaving a bubble of the slow-moving ions. As the
</p>
<p>pulse passes, the electrons are attracted back by the ion charge, forming a negative
</p>
<p>layer around the bubble and converging into an electron bunch behind the bubble.

<p>of magnitude.
</p>
<p>Wakefield experiments in the 10&rsquo;s of GeV regime require a preformed plasma to
</p>
<p>prevent head-erosion of the laser pulse if it has to ionize the plasma also. Such a
</p>
<p>plasma has to have n&gt; 1016 cm�3 over 
1 m and have a radius greater than the
blow-out radius (Fig. 10.54) of order c/ωp&rsquo; 17 μm. Gases such as Li, Rb, or Cs can
be used, but lithium has the advantage that it has a high second ionization potential
</p>
<p>of 75.6 eV, so that Li++ ions can be neglected. Typically, a plasma of density
</p>
<p>5� 1016 cm�3, 1.5 m long, can be created with a 200 mJ laser pulse (4 TW for
50 fs). Such target plasmas were developed by K.A. Marsh and C. Clayton at UCLA
</p>
<p>for experiments at SLAC. Numerous variations of wakefield schemes have been
</p>
<p>developed with the aim of producing high quality electron beams with low emit-
</p>
<p>tance (transverse momentum). For instance, a low frequency laser, such as CO2 can
</p>
<p>be used to form the wake, and a high frequency 800 nm laser used for injection of
</p>
<p>electrons. Finally, these methods can also be applied to positrons for electron-
</p>
<p>positron colliders.
</p>
<p>10.3.1 Free-Electron Lasers
</p>
<p>A related subject is that of the free-electron laser (FEL), which is the opposite of
</p>
<p>plasma accelerators in that an electron beam is used to create radiation rather than
</p>
<p>vice versa. A diagram of an FEL appears in Fig. 10.56. An array of permanent
</p>
<p>magnets, called a wiggler, is shown linearly, though it is usually helical. A
</p>
<p>relativistic electron beam is injected from the left and is wiggled by the Lorentz
</p>
<p>force from the magnets. It also creates a plasma and waves in the plasma. Without
</p>
<p>going into the mathematics, one can see that motion of the beam and the plasma can
</p>
<p>emit radiation, and when phased properly, this radiation can grow at the expense of
</p>
<p>beam energy. The depleted beam is caught in the beam dump at the right.

<p>10.4 Inertial Fusion
</p>
<p>In the 1970s the advent of powerful lasers motivated physicists to explore the
</p>
<p>possibility of achieving fusion in short bursts rather than in a steady-state magne-
</p>
<p>tized plasma. Among these were John Nuckolls and Ray Kidder at Livermore (now
</p>
<p>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory); Keith Brueckner at University of
</p>
<p>California, San Diego; Keeve &ldquo;Kip&rdquo; Siegel in Michigan, and Chiyoe Yamanaka
</p>
<p>in Osaka, Japan. Siegel founded KMS Fusion but died in 1975 while testifying in
</p>
<p>Congress. Inertial fusion can also be achieved without lasers with collapsing
</p>
<p>magnetized metal &ldquo;liners&rdquo; in a z-pinch, or with ion beams, as in Fig. 10.8, but the
</p>
<p>greatest progress has been with lasers. The largest such experiment is the National
</p>
<p>Ignition Facility (NIF) at Livermore. This program could not have started without
</p>
<p>the LASNEX code written by Nuckolls, and laser fusion research still relies
</p>
<p>substantially on computer simulation.
</p>
<p>10.4.1 Glass Lasers
</p>
<p>In laser fusion, a fuel pellet is compressed by laser energy to a density ρ ~ 1000
</p>
<p>times the density of solid DT (0.2 g/cm3), or about 20 times that of lead, and
</p>
<p>temperature of order 10 keV. The Lawson criterion for breakeven in laser fusion
</p>
<p>works out to be
</p>
<p>ρr 
 1g=cm2; &eth;10:21&THORN;
</p>
<p>where r is the compressed radius. For ρ&frac14; 200 g/cm3, r is ~50 μm.
There are two ways to achieve laser fusion. In direct-drive fusion, laser energy is
</p>
<p>directed as uniformly as possible over the surface of a fuel pellet, as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.57. The plastic ablator material is heated by the laser light and blasts off,
</p>
<p>pushing the layer of frozen DT to a density satisfying the Lawson criterion. To
</p>
<p>avoid Rayleigh&ndash;Taylor instabilities (Fig. 6.11), which would make small dimples

<p>grow into large gouges, the laser light is carefully smoothed out by random phase
</p>
<p>plates. The layer of frozen DT is serendipitously smoothed out by the small amount
</p>
<p>of heat from the slow decay of tritium into 3He, an electron, and a neutrino. In the
</p>
<p>U.S., this approach is followed at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics in Rochester,
</p>
<p>NY.
</p>
<p>In indirect-drive fusion, the capsule is compressed by X-rays inside a gold
</p>
<p>cylinder called a hohlraum (&ldquo;empty space&rdquo; in German). Figure 10.58 shows a
</p>
<p>hohlraum with laser beams entering holes at the ends. The beams must not hit the
</p>
<p>sides of the hole, or they would create plasma that will refract or reflect the beams.
</p>
<p>Once inside the hohlraum, the beams strike the walls, creating a bath of X-rays,
</p>
<p>which will then heat the capsule and compress it. This is a miniature version of an
</p>
<p>H-bomb. Several views of hohlraums are shown in Fig. 10.59.
</p>
<p>In the U.S., indirect-drive fusion is explored at the NIF at Livermore. This
</p>
<p>facility is a marvel of engineering. Light from a single oscillator is preamplified
</p>
<p>and then split into 192 beams. The beams are amplified in Nd-glass plates lit by
</p>
<p>LED flashlamps powered by 422 MJ of capacitors. Faraday rotators and polarizers
</p>
<p>are inserted to prevent reflected light from being amplified backward and
</p>
<p>destroying the front end. Since parametric instabilities are less important at shorter
</p>
<p>wavelengths, the 1.05 μm Nd-YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet)
</p>
<p>beams are frequency tripled by KDP (potassium dihydrogen phosphate) crystals to
</p>
<p>351 nm in the green. A single dust particle on one of the glass plates will absorb
</p>
<p>enough laser light to damage the plate, which must be replaced. Refrigerator-sized
</p>
<p>replacement units are stored below beam lines and can be inserted into place. An
</p>
<p>early picture of the NIF laser bay is shown in Fig. 10.60.
</p>
<p>The laser beams are mirrored in a switchyard to enter into a spherical target
</p>
<p>chamber, shown in Fig. 10.61. They must all reach the target within a few
</p>
<p>picoseconds. Light travels only 0.3 mm in a picosecond. Hence the lengths in this
</p>
<p>system the size of a football field have to be kept constant with temperature control.

<p>The beams carry 15 MJ of 351 nm light, giving a peak power of 430 TW. The total
</p>
<p>electricity generation in the U.S. is about 0.5 TW on average.
</p>
<p>Impressive as these numbers are, fusion with glass lasers is not an energy source.
</p>
<p>The goal of ignition, in which the alpha particles from the DT reaction keeps the
</p>
<p>plasma hot, has not been achieved. The most that has been achieved by 2015 is fuel
</p>
<p>gain, in which the fusion energy out is larger than the laser energy in, with a laser
</p>
<p>efficiency of about 1%. Furthermore, the NIF can pulse only twice a day to allow
</p>
<p>the glass to cool. A fusion reactor would require pulsing at 10 Hz. Each shot
</p>
<p>destroys a target such as that shown in Fig. 10.59. The hohlraum cannot simply
</p>
<p>be dropped from the top of the chamber; the DT ice would melt. The target has to be
</p>
<p>shot into the lasers&rsquo; focus in exactly the right orientation. After each shot, the debris
</p>
<p>has to be cleared so as not to interfere with the next laser shot. Heavy products like
</p>
<p>gold take a long time to reach the wall. Liquid Li walls or FLiBe (fluorine, lithium,
</p>
<p>beryllium) waterfalls have been suggested to catch the gamma rays and other
</p>
<p>products but they cannot clear the whole volume rapidly. The NIF cannot lead to
</p>
<p>a fusion reactor. It is funded by the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Stewardship
</p>
<p>program in addition to the Department of Energy and serves as a safe way to
</p>
<p>study such topics as the equation of state under extreme conditions without using
</p>
<p>underground nuclear explosions.
</p>
<p>In addition to accurate focusing, the timing of the laser pulses is crucial. A
</p>
<p>simple intense laser pulse can drive the fuel into a center hotspot until the ρr
</p>
<p>criterion is exceeded, but one can do much better than that. Here are two ways. In
</p>
<p>fast ignition, the compression and heating phases follow each other, just as in a
</p>
<p>gasoline engine. First, one laser pulse compresses the fuel to the required density;
</p>
<p>then a second high-intensity, ultrashort pulse heats the core. The compression pulse
</p>
<p>can have less energy and uniformity than usual, so that the energy gain is 10&ndash;20
</p>
<p>times higher than normal (Fig. 10.62).
</p>
<p>In shock ignition, the general principle is to launch a series of shocks which
</p>
<p>overtake one another at the central spot. In NIF, this is done in just two steps with a
</p>
<p>single laser. Figure 10.63a shows the timing compared with that of a conventional
</p>
<p>single pulse. First, there is a low-velocity compression, which entrains more fuel
</p>
<p>mass and saves energy compared the normal procedure. This is followed by a strong

<p>shock pulse timed to arrive when the compression reaches stagnation at a velocity
</p>
<p>of about 4� 107 cm/s. The shock contains 20&ndash;30 % of the energy of the pulse.
The hope is to generate 120&ndash;150 MJ of fusion power using only 1&ndash;1.6 MJ of laser
</p>
<p>power. Figure 10.63b is a possible design of a capsule suitable for shock ignition,
</p>
<p>and Fig. 10.64 shows the expected fusion energy vs. laser energy.
</p>
<p>To improve the twice-a-day repetition rate, plans are to construct a High
</p>
<p>Repetition Rate Advanced Petawatt Laser System (HAPLS), designed in collabo-
</p>
<p>ration with the Czech Institute of Physics. The laser would produce 1 PW (1015 W)
</p>
<p>in 30 fs pulses at 10 Hz. In collaboration which Czech scientists, this would be
</p>
<p>installed at the Extreme Light Infrastructure Beamlines facility (ELI-Beamlines),
</p>

<p>10.4.2 KrF Lasers
</p>
<p>Krypton fluoride lasers, such as the Electra laser at the Naval Research Laboratory
</p>
<p>in the U.S., can pulse at 5 Hz at 400&ndash;700 J to give almost steady-state power. The
</p>
<p>technology can be extrapolated to 106 shots at 50&ndash;150 kJ for laser fusion. In the
</p>
<p>diagram of Fig. 10.65, an electron beam produced by pulsed power (Sect. 10.2.1.1)
</p>
<p>passes through a 1-mil (0.001 in.) Ti foil to ionize a cell containing Kr and F2. The
</p>
<p>recirculator reflects the electrons to use them a second time. The KrF wavelength of
</p>
<p>248 nm is even shorter than the 3ω, 351 nm wavelength of Nd-YAG lasers and is
</p>
<p>suitable for minimizing parametric instabilities. Though KrF lasers have much
</p>
<p>lower power than glass lasers, they can provide the rep rate needed for fusion.
</p>
<p>10.5 Semiconductor Etching
</p>
<p>All the computers, iPhones, iPads, and tablets are based on a semiconductor chip
</p>
<p>about 1 cm2 in size and containing billions of transistors. The doubling of the
</p>
<p>transistor count every 2 years is known as Moore&rsquo;s Law, shown in Fig. 10.66. A
</p>
<p>&ldquo;chip&rdquo; can contain several cores, or Central Processing Units (CPUs). The progress
</p>
<p>is so rapid that in 1989 the largest Intel chip contained 1.18 million transistors with
</p>
<p>a critical dimension (CD) of 1 μm for its smallest feature. In 2014, the count
</p>
<p>increased to 5.56 billion transistors with a CD of 22 nm (0.022 μm).
</p>
<p>Chips cannot be made without plasmas. The transistors lie on several layers, and

</p>
<p>repeated plasma etching and deposition steps. Some transistors, called FinFETs,
</p>
<p>are themselves three-dimensional. Hundreds of chips are made at once on a
</p>
<p>300-mm wafer of single-crystal silicon. The plasma must be uniform over the
</p>
<p>wafer. Chips near the boundary are usually not as good as those inside and could
</p>
<p>be sold as lower-frequency chips. The industry is pursuing the next step of 450-mm
</p>
<p>wafers, which will greatly increase the yield but would require an even larger

<p>uniform plasma.

<p>Fig. 10.67 electrons flow from the source S to the drain D, so that the positive
</p>
<p>current ID goes from D to S. The current is controlled by the voltage VG, which is
</p>
<p>capacitively coupled through an insulator to change the width of the current
</p>
<p>channel.
</p>
<p>To make such transistors requires a series of steps of masking, etching, and
</p>
<p>deposition. Silicon can be etched chemically with chlorine or fluorine, or physically
</p>
<p>with energetic beams of atoms or ions. Winters and Coburn showed that silicon can
</p>
<p>be etched with XeF2, a gas, but that the etch rate is greatly enhanced by Ar
+. Their
</p>
<p>famous graph is shown in Fig. 10.68. With only XeF2 or with only an argon ion
</p>
<p>beam accelerated through the sheath, the etch rate is more than an order of
</p>
<p>magnitude lower than with both. This effect has been explained by molecular
</p>
<p>dynamics simulations by David Graves. By following the motion of each atom in
</p>
<p>a surface layer of hydrogenated amorphous carbon, he showed, in Fig. 10.69, that
</p>
<p>an argon ion beam sputters away the H atoms near the surface to a depth increasing
</p>
<p>with A+ energy.
</p>
<p>The patterns of Fig. 10.67 are built up layer by layer with photolithography, a
</p>
<p>process shown in Fig. 10.70. A photoresist layer is sensitive to UV light and areas
</p>
<p>exposed to light can be chemically dissolved or retained. The resist blocks the
</p>
<p>etching beams so that the desired pattern is etched in the Si layer underneath. The
</p>
<p>resist is then dissolved away. Figure 10.71 shows the etching process. A plasma
</p>
<p>containing Cl, F, and Ar ions and neutrals is at the top, and ions are accelerated by
</p>
<p>the sheath potential down to the substrate. At the top of each column is the mask
</p>
<p>protecting the layers below it.

<p>The patterning of transistors requires light of wavelengths shorter than critical
</p>
<p>dimensions of their features. As the CDs got smaller, ultraviolet light from excimer
</p>
<p>lasers had to be used. This involved new optics that can pass UV. Eventually,
</p>
<p>shorter wavelengths in the X-ray range will be needed. In that case, only reflective
</p>
<p>optics can be used, and this will require development of new technology. We have a
</p>
<p>long way to go, however, to duplicate the computing ability of the human brain with
</p>
<p>an instrument of that size.

<p>When a deep trench or via is required, a process called DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion
</p>
<p>Etching, Fig. 10.72) is used. To keep the trench straight, etching and passivation are
</p>
<p>applied alternately. Etching is done with, say, SF6; and, after a few seconds, an inert

<p>passivation layer like teflon is laid on with C4F8. This protects the walls, but the
</p>
<p>etching ions can cut through it at the bottoms to allow chemical etching to occur.
</p>
<p>This is sometimes called the Bosch process.
</p>
<p>The bottoms of the trenches can have defects, such as notches or micro-trenches.
</p>
<p>Notches can form from bombardment by ions with curved trajectories. In Fig. 10.73
</p>
<p>the thick shaded layer at the top is the mask, which is charged negatively at the top
</p>
<p>by electrons, which attract the ions, bending them towards the wall. The bottom of
</p>
<p>the trench is charged positively by ions which have collected on the wall. The
</p>
<p>resulting electric fields determine the ion trajectories which etch the notches at the
</p>
<p>bottom. Figure 10.74 shows an SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) image of an
</p>
<p>actual trench deformed with microtrenches.
</p>
<p>The mask shown in Fig. 10.73 is shown with rounded edges. Since the charges
</p>
<p>that build up on these edges create E-fields, the ion orbits vary with these charges.
</p>
<p>An example is shown in Fig. 10.75. This computation compares ion orbits with
</p>
<p>sharp trench entrances with those with rounded ones, taking into account the
</p>
<p>surface charges. A sharp edge shields ions from the sidewalls, whereas even a
</p>
<p>slight rounding of the edge allows ions to deposit positive charge to the wall. A
</p>
<p>more obvious electron shielding effect also occurs, with surface electron charges
</p>
<p>repelling electrons from the nanometer-size trench.
</p>
<p>This was a brief glimpse of the complex technology that makes modern elec-
</p>
<p>tronics possible.

<p>10.6.2 Types of Thrusters
</p>
<p>10.6.2.1 Gridded Thrusters
</p>
<p>A schematic of a gridded thruster is shown in Fig. 10.76. A plasma is created by a
</p>
<p>voltage applied between a cathode and an anode grid. The cathode could be a good
</p>
<p>electron emitter like lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6). Electrons are retained and ions
</p>
<p>are accelerated by grids. The ion beam will not detach from the spacecraft unless it
</p>
<p>is neutralized, so electron emitters have to be added at the sides to inject electrons
</p>
<p>into the accelerated ion beam and prevent the spacecraft from charging to a high
</p>
<p>negative potential. The neutralizers are usually hollow-cathode discharges. The
</p>
<p>ejected plume of plasma can then be formed by nozzles into an optimal shape.
</p>
<p>Sputtering limits the lifetime of the grids, but they have been designed to last at
</p>
<p>least 30,000 h.
</p>
<p>10.6.2.2 Hall Thrusters
</p>
<p>Elements of a Hall thruster are shown in Fig. 10.77, which is a cross section of a
</p>
<p>cylindrically symmetric device. A plasma is formed between the coaxial cylinders
</p>
<p>by applying a high voltage to the anode ring at the left. This voltage accelerates the

<p>ions to vex. Holes in the ring also serve as the gas feed, as shown in the upper cross
</p>
<p>section. Xenon is normally used because of it is an inert, monatomic gas with high
</p>
<p>mass and low ionization potential. A radial magnetic field is created by coils (not as
</p>
<p>shown) in order to prevent electrons from following the ions. The electrons instead
</p>
<p>drift azimuthally with their E�B drift, forming the Hall current. Here again,
electron neutralizers have to be added to neutralize the ejected ion beam. The
</p>
<p>function of the magnetic field is to prevent the electrons from moving axially and
</p>
<p>collapsing the anode voltage into a thin sheath at the anode. Hall thrusters have a
</p>
<p>few intrinsic problems. One is secondary emission of cold electrons from the
</p>
<p>internal surfaces which can upset the charge balance in the plasma. This can be
</p>
<p>minimized by coating the surfaces with carbon velvet. A second problem is
</p>
<p>instability, since many types of instabilities arise when there is a magnetic field
</p>
<p>(B-field). In spite of these problems, Hall thrusters have been engineered success-
</p>
<p>fully to fly in space.
</p>
<p>10.6.2.3 Helicon Thrusters
</p>
<p>Helicon plasmas, described in Sect. 9.5, could be advantageous for thrusters
</p>
<p>because of their high ionization efficiency and their thrust without an auxiliary
</p>
<p>E-field. Elements of a helicon thruster are shown in Fig. 10.78. The required DC
</p>
<p>magnetic field is generated by coils surrounding the tube. The RF is applied to an
</p>
<p>antenna, shown here as one side of a Boswell antenna, which is a version of the
</p>
<p>bidirectional Nagoya Type III antenna. Helical antennas can couple more

<p>efficiently to the dominant m&frac14; +1 azimuthal mode of the helicon wave, and ring
antennas are used for the m&frac14; 0 mode. As the plasma leaves the uniform-field
volume, the field lines diverge as the B-field expands. The electrons follow the
</p>
<p>field lines, and hence their density decreases. Since the electrons are essentially
</p>
<p>Maxwellian, the plasma potential must decrease with the density according to
</p>
<p>Eq. (3.73). There is therefore an electric field along the field lines shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.78. This E-field accelerates ions; and, if Ti� 0, the ion velocity will
eventually reach the acoustic velocity cs. At that point, a sheath will form,
</p>
<p>according to Fig. 8.4, whether or not there is a wall there. This ion-rich sheath in
</p>
<p>&ldquo;mid-air&rdquo; will attract electrons which surround it, forming a double layer which, in
</p>
<p>1D, shields the E-field from the rest of the plasma.
</p>
<p>It is possible to calculate where this double layer will form. The ion energy at the
</p>
<p>sheath edge is &frac12;Mc2s &frac14; &frac12;KTe. To accelerate ions to this energy, the potential at
the sheath edge, Vs, must be at least �&frac12;KTe/e if Vs� 0 in the main plasma. Hence,
the quasineutral density at the sheath edge, ns, is given by Eq. (3.73) as
</p>
<p>ns &frac14; n0 exp �&frac12;&eth; &THORN;: &eth;10:29&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since magnetic flux is conserved in the expansion from r0 to r for each field line,
</p>
<p>and since electrons are constrained to follow the field lines, the field and density
</p>
<p>vary with r as

</p>
<p>Thus, an ion sheath will form at a position where the field lines have increased their
</p>
<p>distances from the axis by 28%. Ions passing through the potential drop of this
</p>
<p>sheath are suddenly accelerated to a velocity vex of Eq. (10.22).
</p>
<p>Helicon thrusters have been tested in space but have not been fully engineered.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, helicon discharges are part of the large thruster VASIMR (Variable
</p>
<p>Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket) being built by former astronaut Franklin
</p>
<p>Chang Dı́az for travel to Mars. A diagram of this device is shown in Fig. 10.79.
</p>
<p>Though helicons are used for ionization, the main power is provided by ICRH (see
</p>
<p>section &ldquo;Heating and Current Drive&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>There will not be a more glamorous application of helicons!

<p>10.7 Plasmas in Everyday Life
</p>
<p>Plasma physics may be an obscure and difficult science, but it is important because
</p>
<p>we see plasmas all the time. Every time we turn on the television, there are plasmas
</p>
<p>inside every pixel. Even before that, when we turn on the fluorescent lights, we are
</p>
<p>using a plasma. Older computer screens are also lit by fluorescents. The light of day
</p>
<p>is caused by the plasma in the sun&rsquo;s photosphere. Moonlight is a reflection of that.
</p>
<p>At night, the stars and nebulas can be seen by their plasma light. Without plasma, it
</p>
<p>would be very dark. Auroras are plasmas generated by the solar wind. When we get
</p>
<p>a shock when touching a doorknob after walking across a rug in winter, the spark is
</p>
<p>a plasma. Lightning is a larger form of that, coming from clouds. Ball lightning,
</p>
<p>though, is a slow-moving ball of plasma that no one understands.
</p>
<p>We conclude with the topic that engendered plasma physics: nuclear fusion,
</p>
<p>which the general public has never heard of. By about 2050, there will be very little
</p>
<p>fossil fuel left; maybe dirty coal, but certainly not oil. Wind, solar, and hydro power
</p>
<p>are insufficient for the world&rsquo;s growing energy needs. Nuclear (fission) energy has
</p>
<p>its well known problems. To survive at least a few more centuries, mankind has to
</p>
<p>develop fusion power. This will require a workforce trained in plasma physics. The
</p>
<p>control of global warming starts in the classroom.

</p>
<p>Units
</p>
<p>The formulas in this book are written in the mks units of the International System
</p>
<p>(SI). In much of the research literature, however, the cgs-Gaussian system is still
</p>
<p>used. The following table compares the vacuum Maxwell equations, the fluid
</p>
<p>equation of motion, and the idealized Ohm&rsquo;s law in the two systems:
</p>
<p>mks-SI cgs-Gaussian

<p>&nabla; �D= e(ni� ne) &nabla; �E = 4πe(ni� ne)

c
v� B &frac14; 0
</p>
<p>The equation of continuity is the same in both systems.
</p>
<p>In the Gaussian system, all electrical quantities are in electrostatic units (esu)
</p>
<p>except B, which is in gauss (emu); the factors of c are written explicitly to
</p>
<p>accommodate this exception. In the mks system, B is measured in tesla (Wb/m2),
</p>
<p>each of which is worth 104 gauss. Electric fields E are in esu/cm in cgs and V/m in
</p>
<p>mks. Since one esu of potential is 300 V, one esu/cm is the same as 3� 104 V/m.
The ratio of E to B is dimensionless in the Gaussian system, so that vE = cE/B. In the
</p>
<p>mks system, E/B has the dimensions of a velocity, so that vE=E/B. This fact is
</p>
<p>useful to keep in mind when checking the dimensions of various terms in an
</p>
<p>equation in looking for algebraic errors.

<p>The current density j= nev has the same form in both systems. In cgs, n and v
</p>
<p>are in cm�3 and cm/s, and e has the value e=4.8� 10�10 esu; then j comes out in
esu/cm2, where 1 esu of current equals c�1 emu or 10/c=1/(3� 109) A. In mks, n and
v are in m�3 and m/s, and e has the value e=1.6� 10�19C; then j comes out in A/m2.
</p>
<p>Most cgs formulas can be converted to mks by replacing B/c by B and 4π by E�10 ,
where 1/4πE0= 9� 109. For instance, electric field energy density is E2/8π in cgs
and E0E
</p>
<p>2/2 in mks, and magnetic field energy density is B2/8π in cgs and B2/2 μ0 in
</p>
<p>mks. Here we have used the fact that (E0μ0)
�1/2= c= 3� 108 m/s.
</p>
<p>The energy KT is usually given in electron volts. In cgs, one must convert TeV to
</p>
<p>ergs by multiplying by 1.6� 10�12 erg/eV. In mks, one converts TeV to joules by
multiplying by 1.6� 10�19 J/eV. This last number is, of course, just the charge e in
mks, since that is how the electron volt is defined.

<p>Appendix B: Theory of Waves in a Cold
Uniform Plasma
</p>
<p>As long as Te = Ti = 0, the waves described in Chap. 4 can easily be generalized to an
</p>
<p>arbitrary number of charged particle species and an arbitrary angle of propagation θ
</p>
<p>relative to the magnetic field. Waves that depend on finite T, such as ion acoustic
</p>
<p>waves, are not included in this treatment.
</p>
<p>First, we define the dielectric tensor of a plasma as follows. The fourth Maxwell
</p>
<p>equation is
</p>
<p>&nabla; � B &frac14; μ0 j&thorn; E0 _E

</p>
<p>&eth;B:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>where j is the plasma current due to the motion of the various charged particle
</p>
<p>species s, with density ns, charge qs, and velocity vs:
</p>
<p>j &frac14;
X
</p>
<p>s
</p>
<p>nsqsvs &eth;B:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>Considering the plasma to be a dielectric with internal currents j, we may write Eq.
</p>
<p>(B.1) as
</p>
<p>&nabla; � B &frac14; μ0 _D &eth;B:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>where

</p>
<p>Here we have assumed an exp (�iωt) dependence for all plasma motions. Let the
current j be proportional to E but not necessarily in the same direction (because of
</p>
<p>the magnetic field B0ẑ); we may then define a conductivity tensor σ by the relation

<p>The uniform plasma is isotropic in the x� y plane, so we may choose the y axis so

<p>μx &frac14; μ sin θ μz &frac14; μ cos θ μy &frac14; 0 &eth;B:24&THORN;

<p>From this it is clear that the Ex, Ey components are coupled to Ez only if one deviates
</p>
<p>from the principal angles θ = 0, 90
.
Equation (B.25) is a set of three simultaneous, homogeneous equations; the
</p>
<p>condition for the existence of a solution is that the determinant of R vanish:
</p>
<p>jjRjj = 0. Expanding in minors of the second column, we then obtain

</p>
<p>The principal modes of Chap. 4 can be recovered by setting θ = 0
 and 90
. When
θ = 0
, there are three roots: P = 0 (Langmuir wave), μ2=R (R wave), and μ2= L
(L wave). When θ = 90
, there are two roots: μ2=RL/S (extraordinary wave) and
μ2=P (ordinary wave). By inserting the definitions of Eq. (B.18), one can verify
</p>
<p>that these are identical to the dispersion relations given in Chap. 4, with the addition
</p>
<p>of corrections due to ion motions.
</p>
<p>The resonances can be found by letting μ go to 1. We then have
</p>
<p>tan 2θres &frac14; �P=S &eth;B:30&THORN;
</p>
<p>This shows that the resonance frequencies depend on angle θ. If θ = 0
, the possible
solutions are P= 0 and S=1. The former is the plasma resonance ω =ωp, while the
latter occurs when either R=1 (electron cyclotron resonance) or L =1 (ion
cyclotron resonance). If θ = 90
, the possible solutions are P=1 or S= 0. The
former cannot occur for finite ωp and ω, and the latter yields the upper and lower
</p>
<p>hybrid frequencies, as well as the two-ion hybrid frequency when there is more than
</p>
<p>one ion species.
</p>
<p>The cutoffs can be found by setting μ= 0 in Eq. (B.26). Again using
</p>
<p>S2�D2=RL, we find that the condition for cutoff is independent of θ:
</p>
<p>PRL &frac14; 0 &eth;B:31&THORN;
</p>
<p>The conditions R = 0 and L = 0 yield the ωR and ωL cutoff frequencies of Chap. 4,
</p>
<p>with the addition of ion corrections. The condition P = 0 is seen to correspond to
</p>
<p>cutoff as well as to resonance. This degeneracy is due to our neglect of thermal
</p>
<p>motions. Actually, P= 0 (or ω=ωp) is a resonance for longitudinal waves and a
</p>
<p>cutoff for transverse waves.
</p>
<p>The information contained in Eq. (B.29) is summarized in the Clemmow&ndash;
</p>
<p>Mullaly&ndash;Allis diagram. One further result, not in the diagram, can be obtained
</p>
<p>easily from this formulation. The middle line of Eq. (B.25) reads
</p>
<p>iDEx &thorn; S� μ2
� �
</p>
<p>Ey &frac14; 0 &eth;B:32&THORN;
</p>
<p>Thus the polarization in the plane perpendicular to B0 is given by
</p>
<p>iEx
</p>
<p>Ey
&frac14; μ
</p>
<p>2 � S
D
</p>
<p>: &eth;B:33&THORN;
</p>
<p>From this it is easily seen that waves are linearly polarized at resonance (μ2=1)
and circularly polarized at cutoff (μ2= 0, R = 0 or L = 0; thus S=�D).

n0 doubly ionized He
</p>
<p>ions, and 2n0 electrons. Show that there are two lower-hybrid frequencies and
</p>
<p>give an approximate expression for each. [Hint: You may use the plasma

<p>text. (You need not solve the equations of motion again; just use the known
</p>
<p>solution.)]
</p>
<p>2. Intelligent beings on a distant planet try to communicate with the earth by
</p>
<p>sending powerful radio waves swept in frequency from 10 to 50 MHz every
</p>
<p>minute. The linearly polarized emissions must pass through a radiation belt
</p>
<p>plasma in such a way that E and k are perpendicular to B0. It is found that
</p>
<p>during solar flares (on their sun), frequencies between 24.25 and 28 MHz do not
</p>
<p>get through their radiation belt. From this deduce the plasma density and
</p>
<p>magnetic field there. (Hint: Do not round off numbers too early.)
</p>
<p>3. When β is larger thanm/M, there is a possibility of coupling between a drift wave
</p>
<p>and an Alfvén wave to produce an instability. A necessary condition for this to
</p>
<p>happen is that there be synchronism between the parallel wave velocities of the
</p>
<p>two waves (along B0).
</p>
<p>(a) Show that the condition β&gt;m/M is equivalent to vA&lt; vth.
(b) If KTe= 10 eV, B = 0.2 T, ky= 1 cm

<p>�1, and n= 1021 m�3 find the required
value of kz for this interaction in a hydrogen plasma. You may assume

<p>0
0 &frac14; dn0=dr.
</p>
<p>4. When anomalous diffusion is caused by unstable oscillations, Fick&rsquo;s law of
</p>
<p>diffusion does not necessarily hold. For instance, the growth rate of drift
</p>
<p>waves depends on &nabla;n/n, so that the diffusion coefficient D&perp; can itself depend
</p>
<p>on &nabla;n. Taking a general form for D&perp; in cylindrical geometry, namely,

<p>To estimate the &nabla;B drift, we must find v&perp; in the frame moving with the
</p>
<p>guiding center. Remember that in deriving v&nabla;B, v&perp; was taken as the
</p>
<p>velocity in the undisturbed circular orbit. Here, the latter is moving with
</p>
<p>velocity vE, so that it does not look circular in the lab frame. Nonetheless,
</p>
<p>it can still be decomposed into a circular motion with velocity v&perp; plus an
</p>
<p>E�B drift of the guiding center. Consider the z component of velocity
(along the wire). At point ① on the orbit, vz&frac14; vE+ v cos ωct&frac14; 0, where
cos ωct&frac14;�1, its maximum negative value; hence, vE&frac14; v&perp;. The same
result can be obtained by considering that at point ② vz&frac14; vE+ v&perp;
(cos ωct&frac14; 1). The energy there, 12 mv2z
</p>
<p>� �
, must equal the energy gained in

<p>falling a distance 2rL in an electric field. Thus

<p>4.34 (a) With the L-wave, the cutoff occurs at ω&frac14;ωL, so that one requires
ω2L &lt; 2ω2. Since ωL&lt;ωp if n0 is fixed (Problem 4.15), one can go to
higher values of n0 (for constant 2ω2) with the L-wave than with the
O-wave.
</p>

<p>Thus, to double the usual cutoff density of 20mω2=e2, one must have

</p>
<p>&frac14; 31:8T
</p>
<p>This would be unreasonably expensive.
</p>
<p>(c) The plasma has a density maximum at the center, so it behaves like a
</p>
<p>convex lens. Such a lens focuses if en &gt; 1 and defocuses if en &lt; 1. The
whistler wave always travels with vϕ&lt; c (Problem 4.19), so
en &frac14; c=vϕ &gt; 1, and the plasma focuses this wave.
</p>
<p>(d) The question is one of accessibility. If ω&lt;ωc everywhere, the whistler
wave will propagate regardless of n0. However, if ω&gt;ωc, the wave will
be cut off in regions of low density. From (b) above, we see that a field of
</p>
<p>31.8 T is required; this seems too large for the scheme to be practical.
</p>
<p>4.35 The answer should come out the same as for cold plasma.
</p>
<p>4.36 The linearized equation of motion for either species is
</p>
<p>�iωmn0v1 &frac14; qn0 E&thorn; v1 � B0&eth; &THORN; � γkTikn1
</p>
<p>Thus
</p>
<p>�iωmn0k:v1 &frac14; qn0 k � E&thorn; k � v1 � B0&eth; &THORN; � γkTik2n1:
</p>
<p>But k &middot;E&frac14; 0 for transverse wave, and k &middot; (v1�B0)&frac14;�v1 &middot; (k�B0)&frac14; 0 by
assumption. The linearized equation of continuity is
</p>
<p>�iωn1 &thorn; n0ik � v1 &frac14; 0
</p>
<p>Substituting for k &middot; v1, we have
</p>
<p>iω2mn1 &frac14; iγkTk2n1
</p>
<p>Thus n1 is arbitrary, and we may take it to be 0. Then the &nabla;p term vanishes for
</p>
<p>both ions and electrons.

</p>
<p>Assume at first that αH is small, so that αA� 1, αH&frac14; α; furthermore, small
α means that υϕ will be nearly unchanged from vs of argon. Then doubling the

<p>The last term is � k2λ2D and is negligible when quasineutrality holds. Thus the
ion wave dispersion relation is the same as usual, except that Ti/Te has been
</p>
<p>replaced by (1� α) Ti/Te. Since small Ti/Te means less Landau damping, the
hot electrons have decreased ion Landau damping.
</p>
<p>8.3 Refer to Fig. 8.4. Take a number of ions with v&frac14; u0 and split them into two
groups, one with v&frac14; u0+Δ and one with v&frac14; u0�Δ. After acceleration in a
potential ϕ, the faster half will have less fractional energy gain (because it
</p>
<p>started with more energy) and, hence, will have less fractional density
</p>
<p>decrease. The opposite is true for the slower half, and to first order the total
</p>
<p>density decrease is the same as if all ions had v&frac14; u0. However, there is a
second-order effect which makes the slower group dominate. This can be seen
</p>
<p>by making Δ so large that v� 0 for the slower half, which clearly must then
suffer a huge density decrease. To compensate for this, u0 must be increased to
</p>
<p>higher than the Bohm value.
</p>
<p>8.4 The maximum current occurs when the space charge of decelerated ions near
</p>
<p>grid 3 decreases the electric field to zero. Thus we can apply the Child-
</p>
<p>Langmuir law to the region between grids 2 and 3.
