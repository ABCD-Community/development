<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When the first edition of the Handbook for AACR2 was issued, the Anglo-American
Cataloguing Rules, second edition, was new and untried. Most catalogers were
familiar with the first edition of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR1)
(1967); many had used the preceding code for cataloging, the ALA 1949 rules. All
were apprehensive about the possible effect the new cataloging code would have
on existing library catalogs. The Handbook, therefore, was designed to assist expe-
rienced catalogers as well as library school students in the application of the most
commonly used rules for description, choice of access points, and form of head-
ing as set forth in the 1978 code, which came to be known as AACR2.
</p>
<p>Although the principles on which the 1978 code was based have not changed
in the two and a half decades since the appearance of AACR2, many modifica-
tions have been made, either by decision of the Joint Steering Committee for
Revision of AACR (JSC) or by the interpretations and policy decisions of the
major Anglo-American national libraries (the Library of Congress, the National
Library of Canada, the British Library, and the National Library of Australia).
</p>
<p>The JSC has been remarkably active since the publication of the last edition of
the Handbook, in 1997. Three chapters have been completely revised (chapter 3,
&ldquo;Cartographic Materials&rdquo;; chapter 9, &ldquo;Electronic Resources&rdquo;; and chapter 12,
&ldquo;Continuing Resources&rdquo;) and new concepts introduced, notably that of integrat-
ing resources. Some significant changes in the MARC format have also taken
place.1 All of this required revisions to the text of the Handbook. The entire book
has been reconsidered in the light of these and other changes through the 2003
revision of AACR2.
</p>
<p>In the last edition the rule interpretations of the four major Anglo-American
national libraries were taken into account, rather than just those of the Library of
Congress.2 This has continued with this fourth edition except for the rule inter-
pretations of the British Library, which were themselves being revised at the time
of revision of the Handbook and were unavailable to the author. The cataloging
examples conform to the Library of Congress&rsquo;s rule interpretations; where other
national libraries differ from these, it is noted in the text. In the interest of pro-
viding usable shared cataloging, U.S. catalogers, particularly those contributing
to national databases such as RLIN and OCLC, should conform to LC practice as
much as possible. Catalogers in other countries should follow the rule interpreta-
tions of their own national libraries.
</p>
<p>Although explanations and examples in this Handbook have been revised and
brought into line with current practice, the basic premises of the first edition of
the Handbook for AACR2 remain the same. The editors of AACR2 include frequent
examples to illustrate the rules; these examples are not in full catalog entry
format. Nor are they given in MARC format. Catalogers as well as library school
students may find these examples mystifying in their brevity. The present text
</p>
<p>ix
</p>
<p>P R E F A C E
</p>
<p>&bull;
</p>
<p>&bull;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>therefore attempts not only to explain the rules, but also to give full cataloging
examples to illustrate each rule discussed. Furthermore, experience teaching cat-
aloging has demonstrated that one of the most difficult concepts for beginning
catalogers is the translation of the title page (or other chief source) into a catalog
entry. Therefore, in as many instances as possible, a transcription of the title page
or other prescribed source material has been included with each example.
</p>
<p>The preponderance of examples selected to illustrate AACR2 chapter 1
(&ldquo;General Rules for Description&rdquo;) in this text are printed books. This is because,
in the experience of the author, printed books continue to represent the majority
of incoming materials to most libraries.  In addition, most of the examples are of
English-language materials. These choices have been made deliberately, in order
to provide a comfortable frame of reference for inexperienced catalogers, most of
whom have more acquaintance with books as library materials than with their
nonprint counterparts. However, given the phenomenal rise of other formats over
the last few years, a number of printed book cataloging examples have been
replaced with examples of electronic resource cataloging. Representative exam-
ples of other nonprint library materials are also included in chapter 1, and these
materials are covered in detail in the following chapters.
</p>
<p>The reader will notice that chapter numbering in AACR2 is not entirely con-
secutive, skipping from chapter 13 to chapter 21 to leave space for possible future
additions and also to accommodate the mnemonic structure of the text. Although
the chapters in the Handbook are numbered consecutively, discussions of individ-
ual rules are numbered to correspond with AACR2. Limitations of space have
made it necessary to omit discussion of those rules whose meanings seem self-
evident and of certain specialized forms of library materials (such as early printed
books) not acquired by most libraries. In addition, no chapter in this Handbook
corresponds to AACR2 chapter 26 (&ldquo;References&rdquo;). AACR2 chapter 26 is a
summary of required references already found in AACR2 chapters 22&ndash;25; these
are discussed in the corresponding Handbook chapters (15&ndash;18).
</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s Handbook for AACR2 is designed as a supplement to, not a substi-
tute for, the text of the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules. It is assumed that the
reader will have the latest revision of AACR2 at hand. In addition, the Handbook&rsquo;s
provisions and examples will need to be updated by issues of the Library of
Congress&rsquo;s Cataloging Service Bulletin (CSB) or the cumulative loose-leaf compila-
tion of Library of Congress Rule Interpretations (LCRI) (also available on the LC
product Cataloger&rsquo;s Desktop). It must be emphasized that this Handbook is not
meant as a self-help manual for beginning catalogers, although with more and
more library schools dropping cataloging requirements (or course work alto-
gether), it is probably inevitable that it will be so used. It is therefore designed to
address problems beginners often find puzzling. It is my hope that the following
pages may serve as a helpful introduction and a guide to the second Anglo-
American cataloging code.
</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s Handbook for AACR2 had its inception as long ago as 1967, when the
author of the first two editions of the Handbook, Margaret F. Maxwell, attended
Seymour Lubetzky&rsquo;s seminar on the new Anglo-American Cataloging Rules
(AACR1) at the University of Illinois. Lubetzky&rsquo;s exposition of cataloging princi-
ples as enunciated at the seminar and on later occasions and his written discus-
sions of rules and theory form the basis for much of the theory presented in this
</p>
<p>x PR E FA C E</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>text. Seymour Lubetzky&rsquo;s death in 2003, three weeks short of his 105th birthday,
marked the end of an important chapter in the history of the development of cat-
aloging theory.
</p>
<p>Many individuals contributed in various ways to Maxwell&rsquo;s Handbook for
AACR2. Thanks go first to Margaret F. Maxwell, the author of the first two edi-
tions of the Handbook, for entrusting me with the last edition and giving encour-
agement along the way. Many thanks must also be given to Robert B. Ewald, of
the Library of Congress, for numerous e-mail responses to questions about
AACR2 and LC practice. A number of people helped with specific chapters. These
include: for chapter 3, Nancy Kandoian of the New York Public Library (com-
ments) and Elizabeth Mangan (who gave permission to see the manuscript of the
new edition of Cartographic Materials); for chapters 5 and 6, Nancy Lorimer of
Stanford University and Janet Bradford of Brigham Young University; for chapter
7, Martha Yee of the UCLA Film and Television Archive; for chapter 9, Matthew
Beacom of Yale University; for chapter 12, Jane Gillis of Yale University. I am very
grateful to each of these.
</p>
<p>Thanks also to the capable editors at ALA Editions, whose superb editing
skills always make a better book, particularly Marlene Chamberlain and Eloise L.
Kinney, and to Janet Russell, who prepared the index.
</p>
<p>I am also grateful to Carla Kupitz, chair of the catalog department at the
Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University, as well as the administration of
the Lee Library, for encouraging me to complete the revision and allowing me
time away from my regular duties for the final preparation of this book.
</p>
<p>Finally, thanks to an understanding wife, Mary Ann Maxwell, who has some-
times considered herself an &ldquo;AACR2 widow,&rdquo; and to my children, Carrie, Rachel,
William, and David. As always, I dedicate this book to them.

<p>NOTES
</p>
<p>1. The examples in this Handbook reflect coding practice as of the time of its publication.
Details of MARC coding are constantly changing, not the least because of some sig-
nificant recent international developments. Since the last edition of the Handbook,
USMARC and CAN/MARC merged to become MARC 21. Additionally, after further
revision to MARC 21, the UK cataloging community, including the British Library
(BL), decided to move from UKMARC to MARC 21 over the next few years (the BL
will implement MARC 21 in early 2004). This means that for the first time a single cat-
aloging exchange standard will be used virtually throughout the English-speaking
world.
</p>

nlc-bnc.ca/6/18/index-e.html&gt;; those of the National Library of Australia, at &lt;http://
www.nla.gov.au/kinetica/manuals/catman.html&gt;. For the Library of Congress, the
Library of Congress Rule Interpretations 2003 update has been used. These are referred to
in the text, respectively, as &ldquo;NLCRI,&rdquo; &ldquo;NLARI,&rdquo; and &ldquo;LCRI.&rdquo;

<p>When the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules appeared in 1967, the code was her-
alded as a new departure in cataloging, a unified set of rules based on principle
rather than on the enumeration of specific problems. And indeed this was the
case. The 1967 rules, like the present code, were based on the &ldquo;Statement of
Principles&rdquo; adopted at the International Conference on Cataloguing Principles,
Paris, October 1961.1 This brief statement, usually referred to as the Paris
Principles, is of such overriding importance to the full understanding of AACR2
as well as its predecessors that it is abridged below.
</p>
<p>1. SCOPE OF STATEMENT
The principles here stated apply only to the choice and form of headings
and entry words. . . .
</p>
<p>2. FUNCTIONS OF THE CATALOGUE
The catalogue should be an efficient instrument for ascertaining
2.1 whether the library contains a particular book specified by
</p>
<p>a. its author and title, or
b. if the author is not named in the book, its title alone, or
c. if author and title are inappropriate or insufficient for identifica-
</p>
<p>tion, a suitable substitute for the title; and
2.2 a. which works by a particular author and
</p>
<p>b. which editions of a particular work are in the library.
</p>
<p>3. STRUCTURE OF THE CATALOGUE
To discharge these functions the catalogue should contain
3.1 at least one entry for each book catalogued, and
3.2 more than one entry relating to any book, whenever this is necessary
</p>
<p>in the interests of the user or because of the characteristics of the
book. . . .

INTRODUCTION</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4. KINDS OF ENTRY
Entries may be of the following kinds: main entries, added entries, and
references. . . .
</p>
<p>5. USE OF MULTIPLE ENTRIES
The two functions of the catalogue (see 2.1 and 2.2) are most effectively
discharged by
5.1 an entry for each book under a heading derived from the author&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>name or from the title as printed in the book, and
5.2 when variant forms of the author&rsquo;s name or of the title occur, an
</p>
<p>entry for each book under a uniform heading, consisting of one partic-
ular form of the author&rsquo;s name or one particular title . . . and
</p>
<p>5.3 appropriate added entries and/or references.
</p>
<p>6. FUNCTION OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF ENTRY
6.1 The main entry for works entered under authors&rsquo; names should nor-
</p>
<p>mally be made under a uniform heading. The main entry for works
entered under title may be either under the title as printed in the
book, with an added entry under a uniform title, or under a uniform
title, with added entries . . . under the other titles. . . .
</p>
<p>6.4 Added entries . . . should also be made under the names of joint-
authors, collaborators, etc., and under the titles of works having their
main entry under an author&rsquo;s name, when the title is an important
alternative means of identification.
</p>
<p>7. CHOICE OF UNIFORM HEADING
The uniform heading should normally be the most frequently used name
(or form of name) or title appearing in editions of the works catalogued
or in references to them by accepted authorities. . . .
</p>
<p>8. SINGLE PERSONAL AUTHOR
8.1 The main entry for every edition of a work ascertained to be by a
</p>
<p>single personal author should be made under the author&rsquo;s name. . . .
</p>
<p>9. ENTRY UNDER CORPORATE BODIES
9.1 The main entry for a work should be made under the name of a cor-
</p>
<p>porate body (i.e., any institution, organized body or assembly of
persons known by a corporate or collective name)
9.11 when the work is by its nature necessarily the expression of the
</p>
<p>collective thought or activity of the corporate body . . .  or
9.12 when the wording of the title or title-page, taken in conjunction
</p>
<p>with the nature of the work, clearly implies that the corporate
body is collectively responsible for the content of the work. . . .
</p>
<p>9.4 The uniform heading for works entered under the name of a corporate
body should be the name by which the body is most frequently iden-
tified in its publications, except that . . .
9.44 for states and other territorial authorities the uniform heading
</p>
<p>should be the currently used form of the name of the territory
concerned in the language best adapted to the needs of the
users of the catalogue. . . .
</p>
<p>xiv IN T R O D U C T I O N</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.5 Constitutions, laws and treaties, and certain other works having
similar characteristics, should be entered under the name of the
appropriate state or other territorial authority, with formal or con-
ventional titles indicating the nature of the material. . . .
</p>
<p>9.6 A work of a corporate body which is subordinate to a superior body
should be entered under the name of the subordinate body [i.e., as an
independent entity] except that
9.61 if this name itself implies subordination . . . or is insufficient to
</p>
<p>identify the subordinate body, the heading should be the name
of the superior body with the name of the subordinate body as
a subheading. . . .
</p>
<p>10. MULTIPLE AUTHORSHIP
When two or more authors shared in the creation of a work,
10.1 if one author is represented in the book as the principal author . . .
</p>
<p>the main entry for the work should be made under [this] name. . . .
10.2 if no author is represented as the principal author, the main entry
</p>
<p>should be made under
10.21 the author named first on the title-page, if the number of
</p>
<p>authors is two or three, added entries being made under the
name(s) of the other author(s);
</p>
<p>10.22 the title of the work, if the number of authors is more than
three, added entries being made under the author named first
in the book. . . .
</p>
<p>10.3 Collections
The main entry for a collection consisting of independent works or
parts of works by different authors should be made
10.31 under the title of the collection, if it has a collective title;
10.32 under the name of the author, or under the title, of the first
</p>
<p>work in the collection, if there is no collective title. . . .
</p>
<p>11. WORKS ENTERED UNDER TITLE
11.1 Works having their main entry under the title are
</p>
<p>11.11 works whose authors have not been ascertained;
11.12 works by more than three authors, none of whom is princi-
</p>
<p>pal  author (see 10.22);
11.13 collections of independent works or parts of works, by dif-
</p>
<p>ferent authors, published with a collective title;
11.14 works (including serials and periodicals) known primarily or
</p>
<p>conventionally by title rather than by the name of the author.
11.2 An added entry . . . should be made under the title for
</p>
<p>11.21 anonymous editions of works whose authors have been
ascertained;
</p>
<p>11.22 works having their main entry under the name of the 
author, when the title is an important alternative means 
of identification. . . .
</p>
<p>11.5 When a serial publication is issued successively under different
titles, a main entry should be made under each title for the series of
issues bearing that title, with an indication of at least the immedi-
ately preceding and succeeding titles.
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12. ENTRY WORD FOR PERSONAL NAMES
When the name of a personal author consists of several words, the choice
of entry word is determined so far as possible by agreed usage in the . . .
language which he generally uses.
</p>
<p>AACR1, although it was based on the Paris Principles, suffered from a
number of deficiencies that were only partially resolved through a series of revi-
sions in the years between 1967 and the publication of AACR2 in 1978. In the first
place, although, as its name suggests, AACR1 was intended to be a joint British-
American code, one that would unify cataloging practice throughout the English-
speaking world, this was never actually achieved. Supported by the Association
of Research Libraries, the North American contingent of the AACR1 code com-
mittee decided on two special exceptions to the principle of entry of a corporate
body under the name by which it chooses to identify itself (Paris Principles 9.4).
Local churches and &ldquo;certain other corporate bodies&rdquo; (i.e., educational institutions,
libraries, galleries, museums, agricultural experiment stations, airports, botanical
and zoological gardens, and hospitals) were, under very carefully specified con-
ditions, to be entered under place (AACR1 98 and 99). The British representatives
on the code committee refused to accept this partial return to ALA 1949 cata-
loging rules; they also rejected AACR1 23, 24, and 25 (court rules and rules for
treaties). AACR1 was finally issued in two versions, a North American Text and a
British Text.
</p>
<p>Almost as serious, from the point of view of international unification of cata-
loging practice, was the refusal of the Anglo-American code makers to accept the
majority position on Paris Principle 10.3, which called for the entry of a collection
under title when such a work had a collective title. The Anglo-American prefer-
ence was for entry under compiler when such a name was openly expressed;
AACR1 4 and 5 at first reflected this position. A change was made in the rule in
1975 (CSB 112, winter 1975, p. 1&ndash;8) to bring Anglo-American practice into confor-
mity with Paris Principle 10.3. The lamentable exceptions for entry under place of
AACR1 98 and 99 were eliminated by CSB 109 (May 1974), p. 3&ndash;4.
</p>
<p>A continuing problem even after the adoption of AACR1 was the Library of
Congress&rsquo;s policy of superimposition. Under superimposition, headings estab-
lished by the Library of Congress before AACR1 went into effect continued to be
used for current cataloging, even though these headings had not been formulated
according to provisions of the 1967 code. This led to a mixture of headings, some
cataloged by &ldquo;old&rdquo; and some by &ldquo;new&rdquo; rules. Librarians who wished to take
advantage of Library of Congress cataloging in their own libraries had to be
familiar with ALA 1949 rules, at least to the extent of understanding how ALA
1949 differed from AACR1, so that they could interpret Library of Congress head-
ings and assist patrons in their use of the library&rsquo;s catalog. This problem was par-
tially solved by LC&rsquo;s decision to &ldquo;de-superimpose&rdquo; certain headings, as
announced in CSB 106 (May 1973), p. 2&ndash;3.2
</p>
<p>Clearly it was time for an end to ad hoc patchwork, time for a rethinking of
the entire structure of the code. The second edition of the Anglo-American
Cataloguing Rules had its genesis in a meeting of cataloging experts held in March
1974, at which time it was agreed that a new edition of the cataloging code was
needed. The Joint Steering Committee for Revision of AACR (JSC), composed of
</p>
<p>xvi IN T R O D U C T I O N</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>representatives from each of the five bodies most directly affected by the code&mdash;
the American Library Association, the Library of Congress, the (British) Library
Association, the British Library, and the Canadian Committee on Cataloguing&mdash;
was set up at this meeting (the Australian Committee on Cataloguing has since
joined the JSC). Direct implementation of code revision was to be handled by
ALA&rsquo;s RTSD Catalog Code Revision Committee (CCRC), the Canadian Com-
mittee on Cataloguing, and the Library Association/British Library Committee
on Revision of AACR.
</p>
<p>The charge to these groups was fourfold: (1) The new code was to incorporate
all changes authorized since the appearance of AACR1; (2) like the first edition,
AACR2 was to conform to the Paris Principles governing choice of access points
and form of heading; (3) rules for bibliographic description were to be based on
International Standard Bibliographic Description for Monographs (ISBD(M)); and (4)
committee members were to keep in mind developments in machine processing
of catalog records that might affect cataloging.3
</p>
<p>The committees set about almost immediately. In the three years that fol-
lowed, members spent countless hours in careful study and revision of each part
of the 1967 AACR1. The Paris Principles and AACR1 were oriented firmly in the
concept of the library as a collection of books. Rules for entry and heading did not
mention nonprint library materials; AACR1 Part III, rules for descriptive cata-
loging of nonbook materials, was a hodgepodge of confusing rules based on
format of material rather than type of bibliographic problem. The new rules
would be based on principles applicable to all types of library materials, both
book and nonbook alike. In 1976, the IFLA Working Group on International
Standard Bibliographic Description (General) (ISBD(G)) assigned Michael
Gorman to work out a framework for the descriptive cataloging of all types of
library materials. This pattern, which was based on the 1974 ISBD(M), served as
the basis of  AACR2 Part I, the rules for descriptive cataloging.
</p>
<p>Over the next two decades the JSC considered and approved changes and
amendments to the rules as they became necessary. As an exercise to take stock of
progress and look to the future, the JSC sponsored a meeting of cataloging experts
in 1997, the International Conference on the Principles and Future Development
of AACR, held in Toronto.4 Since then the JSC has set itself an ambitious agenda
to implement many of the ideas emanating from the conference. To date the most
evident fruit of the conference is the new chapter 12 for &ldquo;Continuing Resources,&rdquo;
which has changed the way catalogers look at seriality.
</p>
<p>Another important development on the international front has been the publi-
cation of the IFLA study Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR).5
This document represents a significant advance in our understanding of how the
bibliographic universe works and what the aims of the bibliographic record are.
The division of the bibliographic universe into work, expression, manifestation,
and item has been and will continue to be influential on the development of the
code, as will FRBR emphasis on the relationships between entities in biblio-
graphic records.
</p>
<p>AACR2 Part I begins with a general chapter that sets out rules applying to all
types of library materials, both print and nonprint. This general chapter is an
effort to approach the ideal enunciated by Eric Hunter in 1975 at the Anglo-
Nordic Seminar on the Revision and International Use of AACR, held in York,
</p>
<p>IN T R O D U C T I O N xvii</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>England.  &ldquo;What is really required,&rdquo; said Hunter, &ldquo;is one International Standard
Bibliographic Description which will cover all media and within which the basis
of main entry will be title.&rdquo;6
</p>
<p>While the present code is still based on the concept of main entry under the
person or body responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of the item, it is
obvious that the shift toward increasing use of title main entry for catalog records
will continue. Under AACR chapter 6 (1974), 134D1 alternative rule, the cataloger
could, under certain conditions, omit the author statement in the body of the
entry. AACR2 virtually eliminates this option. Under no circumstances (unless
the cataloger chooses to adopt &ldquo;first-level&rdquo; descriptive cataloging; see AACR2
1.0D1) will the statement of responsibility be omitted, as long as it appears
&ldquo;prominently&rdquo; in the item (AACR2 1.1F1). This, in effect, makes the catalog entry
created according to AACR2 Part I rules a possible title unit entry, to which
various access points may be added, with no distinction as to &ldquo;main&rdquo; and
&ldquo;added&rdquo; entries. As a matter of fact, this was an option that AACR2 Part II,
chapter 21, &ldquo;Choice of Access Points,&rdquo; originally allowed. However, this option
was dropped in the final version of AACR2, chiefly because of the firm ground-
ing of the Paris Principles in the principle of main entry and authorship respon-
sibility, and the charge of the AACR2 Joint Steering Committee to adhere to the
Paris Principles.
</p>
<p>AACR2 chapter 1, as already mentioned, deals with general principles of bib-
liographic description applicable to all kinds of library materials. Following this
general chapter is a series of chapters, each dealing with a special form of library
material and special rules to be applied in addition to the general rules. These
special chapters refer to applicable rules in the general chapter whenever possi-
ble rather than repeating general principles already given. Each special chapter is
arranged, like chapter 1, in the following order:
</p>
<p>1. Rules for sources of information: the part of the resource being cataloged
that is to be preferred in transcribing the catalog entry
</p>
<p>2. Punctuation: prescribed punctuation that must be used between areas and
elements of the catalog entry
</p>
<p>3. Organization of the description: rules governing the transcription of each
of the following:
a. Title and statement of responsibility area
b. Edition area
c. Material (or type of publication) specific details area (used only when
</p>
<p>cataloging cartographic materials, music, electronic resources, and
continuing resources)
</p>
<p>d. Publication, distribution, etc., area
e. Physical description area
f. Series area
g. Note area
h. Standard number and terms of availability area
</p>
<p>The 1967 AACR1 was criticized on the international level for a number of
reasons. First, it came under fire for its deviations from the Paris Principles,
including too broad a concept of personal authorship, for an unacceptable
approach to corporate authorship, and for an unacceptable concept of entry of
</p>
<p>xviii IN T R O D U C T I O N</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>serials under corporate body.7 Some cataloging experts, among them Michael
Gorman, criticized AACR1 for its emphasis on the concept of main entry, which
Gorman called &ldquo;a relic of outdated technology&rdquo; made obsolete by computer-
based catalogs with multiple access points for all works contained in the
database.8 Part II of AACR2, rules for access points and headings, addresses itself
to these problems, and in some instances makes substantive and worthwhile con-
tributions toward solving them.
</p>
<p>Rules for form of personal names in AACR2 are fundamentally the same as
in AACR1, which followed the guidelines of the Paris Principles in most cases.
However, AACR1 rules for both form and choice of entry for corporate bodies
were not considered satisfactory. AACR2 rules for entry under corporate body
show the influence of Eva Verona&rsquo;s definitive study of corporate bodies, in limit-
ing main entry under corporate heading to works of an administrative nature
dealing with the corporate body, its staff, its resources, or official statements
recording the collective thought or activity of the body.9 Entry under government
heading is limited to administrative regulations, decrees, laws, court rules, leg-
islative hearings, treaties, charters, and constitutions.
</p>
<p>Even before its first publication in 1978, AACR2 was criticized by some cata-
loging experts as being too traditional in its approach, too firmly rooted in the
premachine-processing era of bibliographic control. It is possible that it may,
indeed, be the last catalog code based on the concept of main entry; it may be an
interim code on the way to a truly revolutionary concept of computer-oriented
bibliographical control. However, as it stands, it still represents a great step
forward toward the ideal of universal bibliographic exchange of cataloging data.
</p>
<p>Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC)
</p>
<p>All the cataloging examples in this edition of the Handbook are given in machine-
readable, or MARC, format. When the application of the computer to library tasks
began in the early 1960s, cataloging was one of the obvious candidates for auto-
mation. The computer could not simply digest a catalog record in card format,
however, and generate a sensible result; furthermore, the possibilities of access to
computerized records far surpassed access to the traditional card catalog, but
only if the records were properly coded so that the machine could distinguish, for
example, between a title and an author, or between a series and a subject heading.
Thus various systems of encoding bibliographic data have grown up around the
world.
</p>
<p>In addition to improved access to the records, computerization of cataloging
has also opened the possibility of shared cataloging. Large international data-
bases (for example, RLIN and OCLC) have appeared, containing catalog records
contributed by member libraries for most of the world&rsquo;s current publishing and a
large percentage of earlier works. Such a project requires standardization of the
computerized cataloging format used by the various libraries. Currently there is
no single internationally accepted format, but efforts are under way for the recon-
ciliation of formats so that the goal of easily exchangeable cataloging records
around the world can be realized. The mechanism for worldwide transmission of
data, the Internet, is already in place and has become a catalyst for more serious
efforts at standardization than have taken place in the past.
</p>
<p>IN T R O D U C T I O N xix</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Library of Congress was one of the first organizations to develop a
machine-readable format for catalog records, and this format has evolved into
what is currently called &ldquo;MARC 21.&rdquo; MARC 21 is used almost universally
throughout the United States and Canada and is about to be adopted in the
United Kingdom. It is also widely used in other English-speaking countries. Use
of a single standard greatly enhances the ease of information exchange in the
Anglo-American cataloging world.
</p>
<p>All examples in this Handbook are coded in MARC 21 format, henceforth
referred to simply as &ldquo;MARC.&rdquo; Details about the coding of the descriptive portion
of the catalog record will be found in chapter 1; an explanation of the coding of
access points (main and added entries) is given in chapter 14. MARC authorities
format is described in chapters 15, 17, and 18. A general introduction follows.
</p>
<p>The MARC catalog record is divided into &ldquo;fields,&rdquo; which in turn are divided
into &ldquo;subfields.&rdquo; These correspond to various aspects of the catalog record. The
fields are all numbered with a three-digit numeric &ldquo;tag.&rdquo; Although not all
numbers are used, there is a theoretical possibility of up to 999 fields (from 001 to
999). Following the field tag in the MARC record are two numeric digits called
&ldquo;indicators.&rdquo; Each of these may either be blank or may contain a number, which
normally instructs the machine to manipulate the data in some way (e.g., for
display or indexing purposes). Following the indicators are the subfields, which
contain the actual cataloging data. Each subfield is preceded by a delimiter mark
(in this Handbook shown by a double dagger, &ldquo;&Dagger;&rdquo;) and a single letter or number,
which tells what type of subfield is being used. This system can obviously become
extremely complex, but it is organized in a logical fashion and incorporates a
system of mnemonics that are very helpful.
</p>
<p>(In the following discussion, the letter X in a field tag represents any number
from 0 to 9. For example, 1XX can represent 100, 110, 130, etc.; X11 can represent
111, 711, 811, etc.)
</p>
<p>The theoretically possible 999 MARC tags are divided into groups of 100.
0XX fields comprise mainly control fields and record various types of identi-
</p>
<p>fication and classification numbers. A common field from this group found in this
Handbook is the 020 field, where the International Standard Book Number (ISBN)
is recorded (see chapter 1, figure 1-1).
</p>
<p>1XX fields record the main entry, including personal authors, corporate
names, meeting names, and uniform titles. Because there may only be one main
entry per catalog record, there will never be more than one 1XX field in a record.
</p>
<p>2XX fields mainly contain title information. The most common of these are
the 245 field, the title and statement of responsibility, and the 246 field, where
variations on the title are recorded. Another 2XX field, not containing title infor-
mation, is the 260 field, where imprint information is recorded (see chapter 1,
figure 1-1).
</p>
<p>3XX fields, which may be repeated, contain the physical description of the
item (see chapter 1, figure 1-1, 300 field).
</p>
<p>4XX fields record series statements as found on the item; if the series has been
established differently from that given on the item, the 4XX field is combined
with an 8XX field (see discussion in this Handbook at AACR2 1.6 and chapter 1,
figure 1-40).
</p>
<p>5XX fields contain various types of notes (see chapter 1, figure 1-1).
</p>
<p>xx IN T R O D U C T I O N</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6XX fields contain subject headings. Because AACR2 does not address subject
access, these fields are not as a rule found in the cataloging examples in this
Handbook.
</p>
<p>7XX fields contain added access points to the record, which may include
headings for coauthors, illustrators, translators, etc.
</p>
<p>8XX fields contain series added entries (see 4XX, above).
9XX fields are locally defined fields; each library may define these as it wishes
</p>
<p>in accord with its own policies. The number 9 in other positions, also, means
locally defined: X9X fields (e.g., 590) are reserved for local use as well.
</p>
<p>In addition to the division of the 999 numbers into ten blocks, certain
mnemonic devices exist that cross these blocks. In the 1XX, 6XX, 7XX, and 8XX
fields, the second and third digits of the tag have parallel meanings. The most
common of these used in this Handbook follow:
</p>
<p>X00 signifies a personal name. For example, the 100 field contains a main
entry heading that is a personal name (see chapter 1, figure 1-1).
</p>
<p>X10 signifies a corporate name. For example, the 710 field contains an added
entry heading that is a corporate name (see chapter 1, figure 1-11).
</p>
<p>X11 signifies a meeting or conference name. A 111 field contains a main entry
that is the name of a conference or meeting (see chapter 1, figure 1-11).
</p>
<p>X30 signifies a uniform title not linked to an author (see chapter 1, figure 1-19
for a uniform title as main entry).
</p>
<p>The MARC record also includes numerous fields that are not explained in this
Handbook. Only MARC fields that contain data called for by AACR2 are included
(the figures, therefore, contain no &ldquo;fixed fields&rdquo;).10
</p>
<p>A Note on Headings Used in This Handbook
</p>
<p>The first thirteen chapters of AACR2 and this Handbook treat the rules for the
&ldquo;descriptive&rdquo; cataloging of the item. Rules for access points (main and added
entries) aside from subject headings (which are not considered in AACR2) are
found in chapters 21&ndash;25 of AACR2 and are discussed in chapters 14&ndash;18 of the
Handbook. The examples throughout the Handbook, however, are fully cataloged,
including both the descriptive portion of the record and the access points. It is
expected that the user will consult both parts of the Handbook (and, indeed,
AACR2) in order to fully understand the cataloging of the examples. In addition,
the index should be consulted under &ldquo;MARC fields&rdquo; for fields not explained with
a particular figure. All added access points have been checked against the Name
Authority File (&lt;http://authorities.loc.gov&gt;) as it appeared at the time of publi-
cation; the form found there has been used in the Handbook. On the concept of
&ldquo;authority&rdquo; and the Name Authority File, see Handbook chapters 15, 17, and 18.

<p>Part I of the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR2) deals with descriptive cat-
aloging: the identification and description of a work in such a fashion that it can
be distinguished from all other works and from other editions of the same work.
As Paul Dunkin put it, this is the part of the catalog entry that tells what the work
looks like&mdash;rather than who is responsible for it.1 Rules in AACR2 Part II tell the
cataloger how to choose the person or corporate body chiefly responsible for the
intellectual content of the work described by rules in AACR2 Part I. They also tell
the cataloger how to construct a heading for the &ldquo;main entry&rdquo; thus chosen, as well
as correct format for other access points (&ldquo;added entries&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>In the example shown in figure 1-1, the 100 field of the entry (Mather, Paul D.)
is called the main entry.2 The main entry is always found in the 1XX field of the
MARC record unless the title is the main entry. The choice of Mather as main
entry rather than, for instance, the title, is governed by AACR2 Part II, chapter 21.
AACR2 chapter 22, &ldquo;Headings for Persons,&rdquo; gives rules for the form in which this
entry must appear. Part I includes rules for everything else in the figure. Subject
headings and classification, which are outside the scope of the Anglo-American
Cataloguing Rules, will not be included in cataloging samples in this Handbook.
</p>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, the descriptive cataloging rules of Part I
are based on International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD). This is an
internationally agreed upon framework for cataloging rules for description that
has established essential items of information that must appear in the entry, the
order in which these items will be given, and a system of arbitrary punctuation
that must be used. The purpose of this standardized format is &ldquo;to facilitate the
international exchange of bibliographic information, whether in written or
machine-readable form . . .  [and to] permit quick identification of the elements
[of a catalog entry] even by the catalog user who is totally unfamiliar with the lan-
guage of the description.&rdquo;3

<p>1.0B. Organization of the description
</p>
<p>Elements to be included in the descriptive part of the catalog entry are divided
into areas (an area is a major section of the ISBD). If these appear in the item being
cataloged, they must be given in the following order:
</p>
<p>1. Title and statement of responsibility area. This will be discussed in detail
under AACR2 1.1. This area appears in the MARC 245 field.
</p>
<p>2. Edition area. To be discussed under AACR2 1.2. This area appears in the
MARC 250 field.
</p>
<p>3. Material (or type of publication) specific details area. This area is used only
with cartographic materials (see discussion in chapter 3), music (see dis-
cussion in chapter 5), electronic resources (see discussion in chapter 9), and
continuing resources (see discussion in chapter 12).
</p>
<p>4. Publication, distribution, etc., area. To be discussed under AACR2 1.4. This
area appears in the MARC 260 field.
</p>
<p>5. Physical description area. To be discussed under AACR2 1.5. This area
appears in the MARC 300 field.
</p>
<p>6. Series area. To be discussed under AACR2 1.6. This area appears in the
MARC 440 or 490 field.
</p>
<p>7. Note area. To be discussed under AACR2 1.7. This area mainly appears in
MARC 5XX fields.
</p>
<p>8. Standard number and terms of availability area. This is the last area in the
AACR2 catalog entry, but appears early in the MARC record (see discus-
sion under AACR2 1.8 for details). This area appears in the MARC 020 or
022 field.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.0C. Punctuation
</p>
<p>In the card format prescribed by AACR2, except for the first area, each area is pre-
ceded by a full stop (period) - space - dash - space (. - - ). (In typing, a dash con-
sists of two hyphens: - -.) This prescribed punctuation is omitted only when the
next area is paragraphed. North American cataloging practice calls for a new
paragraph at the beginning of the physical description area and at the beginning
of each note in the note area as well as the standard number and terms of avail-
ability area. Do not use full stop - space - dash - space to separate these areas from
those preceding them.
</p>
<p>Except for the full stop at the end of an area, punctuation and formatting
between areas is not entered as a part of the MARC record.
</p>
<p>Elements within each of the areas also have prescribed punctuation. This
punctuation will be included in the detailed discussion of each area that follows
(1.1 through 1.8).
</p>
<p>When entering cataloging data, enter only one space after a period. For ex-
ample, when writing a note consisting of more than one sentence, do not double-
space between sentences. When recording personal names consisting of separate
letters, do not space between the letters (e.g., &ldquo;E.B. White&rdquo;). For further informa-
tion on spacing conventions, see Library of Congress Rule Interpretations [here-
inafter LCRI] 1.0C (Nov. 2003), and AACR2 Rule Interpretations [of the National
Library of Canada], accessible at &lt;http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/6/18/index-e.html&gt;
[hereinafter NLCRI], 1.0C.
</p>
<p>1.0D. Levels of detail in the description
</p>
<p>AACR2 allows the cataloger to choose among three levels of detail in cataloging
description.
</p>
<p>1.0D1. First-level description. The first level is brief cataloging. The cataloger
is to include only the title proper, omitting other title information. The statement
of responsibility may also be omitted if it is the same as the main entry heading
(see Handbook at 1.1 for a discussion and explanation of the title and statement of
responsibility area). The edition statement is included, but not an accompanying
statement of responsibility (see Handbook at 1.2). A material (or type of publica-
tion) specific details statement is included if appropriate. Publication data include
only the name of the first publisher and the date of publication. Pagination (for
books), notes, and standard number, if available, complete the entry. First-level
description would probably be sufficient to identify items in a small library col-
lection (see figure 1-2a).
</p>
<p>1.0D2. Second-level description. The second level includes all of the infor-
mation given in level 1 cataloging. In addition, the cataloger will include general
material designation (1.1C) after the title proper if the library has decided to use
it for this type of library material. Parallel titles (1.1D) and other title information
(1.1E) will be included. They will be followed by all pertinent statements of re-
sponsibility (1.1F). The edition statement together with its first statement of 
responsibility is included if it is found in the work (1.2). First place, first publisher,
and date of publication are given (1.4). The physical description area will include
all items specified in applicable rules (1.5) except that accompanying material, if
</p>
<p>GE N E R A L RU L E S F O R DE S C R I P T I O N 3</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>any, will not be given as a part of this area. The series statement is recorded (1.6).
Notes and standard number are included as appropriate. This level might appro-
priately be used in medium-sized libraries (see figure 1-2b).
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress has stated that most of its cataloging will be at the
second level, &ldquo;although the implementation of certain options automatically
means that the third level has been achieved&rdquo; (Cataloging Service Bulletin [here-
inafter CSB] 13, summer 1981, p. 4). The National Library of Canada also catalogs
at the second level &ldquo;for the most part . . . with supplementary data added as
required&rdquo; (NLCRI, &ldquo;Levels of Detail in Description&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>1.0D3. Third-level description. The third level includes all the rules applica-
ble to the item being cataloged. Third-level description is appropriate to large
libraries and research collections (see figure 1-2c).
</p>
<p>No matter which of the three levels of description the cataloger decides to
use, choice of access points for main entry and form of headings will be the same
(see AACR2 Part II). For this reason, it is quite feasible to interfile any or all of the
different levels of description into one catalog. Thus, libraries that use LC cata-
loging data can continue to do so, even though they may decide to use a simpler
level for original cataloging done in the home library.

<p>Similar, but not identical to, the levels of description set out in AACR2 1.0D
are the record standards developed by the Program for Cooperative Cataloging
(PCC) for use in BIBCO (the Bibliographic Record Cooperative Program).  In 1994
a &ldquo;core&rdquo; standard was defined that&mdash;it was hoped&mdash;would be acceptable to a
wide range of libraries, and that would encourage the production of more usable
records at a lower cost. The chief difference between the &ldquo;core&rdquo; and the &ldquo;full&rdquo;
standard is a reduction in the core of the number of subject entries, although there
is a reduction in descriptive cataloging elements as well, notably in the note area.
The core standard has not been universally accepted, but it is being used by many
catalogers for at least some of their cataloging. For more information on the core
standard, see the BIBCO web site, &lt;http://www.loc.gov/catdir/pcc/bibco.html&gt;.</p>

<p>1.0E. Language and script of the description
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress has amplified provisions of this rule in regard to tran-
scription of the letters u/v, uu, or vv/w in Latin works published after 1800.
When these letters are used without regard to their vocalic value (e.g., v is used
for u medially, etc.), the cataloger will transcribe
</p>
<p>v for consonants (vox)
u for vowels (historiarum)
w for consonantal uu or vv.

<p>I and j should be transcribed as they appear (LCRI 1.0E, May 1995) (see figure 1-3).

<p>1.1. TITLE AND STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY AREA
</p>
<p>The first cataloging area is called the title and statement of responsibility area.
General rules for the transcription of this area are included in AACR2 1.1, exclud-
ing rules for prescribed punctuation, which are covered in section 1.0C.
</p>
<p>1.1A2. Sources of information. In general, the cataloger transcribes what he
or she sees, in the order in which it appears on the chief source of information
(e.g., the title page for books). However, if the elements of this area are not in pre-
scribed order on the source, they are transposed to bring them into correct order,
which must be as follows: title / statement of responsibility (see figure 1-4). See
also AACR2 1.1F3, which specifies transposing a statement of responsibility to its
proper position &ldquo;unless it is an integral part of the title proper.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>As seen in the example in figure 1-5, the title proper is separated from other
titles by space - colon - space. The entire title element (title proper and other titles)
is separated from the statement of responsibility by space - slash - space.

<p>This area appears in the 245 field of the MARC record. The first indicator
determines the tracing of the title. If the title is also the main entry (i.e., there is no
1XX field), this indicator is &ldquo;0.&rdquo; Otherwise, it is &ldquo;1.&rdquo; The second indicator gives
the number of &ldquo;nonfiling characters&rdquo; (i.e., the number of characters that the
machine must skip in order for the title to file properly in an index). Thus, in
figure 1-5, in order for the system to file on the word &ldquo;bookman&rsquo;s&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;The,&rdquo; this indicator is coded &ldquo;4.&rdquo; Initial articles are normally to be ignored in
filing (unless, for example, they are part of a proper name); in languages that have
case, they are ignored for filing purposes whether or not they are in the nomina-
tive case (e.g., &ldquo;dem&rdquo; and &ldquo;des&rdquo; are ignored in German) (see CSB 52, spring 1991,
p. 26). A useful list of initial articles in many languages was added to AACR2 in
2001 as Appendix E. A similar list is found in MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic
Data (Washington, D.C.: Library of Congress Cataloging Distribution Service,
1999- ), Appendix F.
</p>
<p>Field 245 is, in general, divided into three subfields. Subfield &Dagger;a contains the
title proper (including any alternative titles). Subfield &Dagger;b contains the remainder
of the title (e.g., parallel titles or other title information). The statement of respon-
sibility is contained in subfield &Dagger;c (see figures 1-4 and 1-5). Field 245 always ends
with a full stop, even if the recorded data end with a parenthesis or bracket (see
figure 1-6).

<p>1.1B. Title proper
</p>
<p>The title and statement of responsibility area is to be transcribed exactly as to
wording and spelling, but not necessarily as to capitalization and punctuation.
Except for extremely long titles, do not omit any words (see 1.1B4). Do not abbre-
viate or correct the spelling of any words (but see 1.0F1).
</p>
<p>Capitalization follows normal usage for the language of the title, as pre-
scribed in AACR2 Appendix A. Figure 1-4 is capitalized according to German-
language practice, which calls for the capitalization of the first word of the title
and all other nouns. English-language titles are not capitalized according to usual
citation practice, as they would be listed in a bibliography. Instead, capitalize the
first word and any proper names. Figures 1-1 and 1-5 illustrate this.
</p>
<p>Punctuation between elements (i.e., title proper, parallel title, other title infor-
mation, and statement of responsibility) is prescribed (1.1A1). Within the tran-
scription, however, punctuation other than prescribed punctuation may generally
be transcribed from the source, added, or omitted as necessary according to
normal practice. For an exception, note that both ellipses ( . . . ) and square brack-
ets ( [ ] ) if present within the title proper must be replaced (see 1.1B1 and figure
1-4). One mark of more or less normal punctuation is prescribed in 1.1B9, which
requires a full stop (.) to separate the parts of certain titles proper. The full stop,
as well as any other mark of normal punctuation retained within the title proper,
is given with normal spacing (i.e., no space preceding). The comma represents the
most frequent example, as in the cases of alternative titles or such titles as the fol-
lowing: Herblock, his influence on cartoon art.
</p>
<p>An exclamation point (!) or a question mark (?) occurring as part of a title
proper will be retained. Sometimes, as in figure 1-7, the title proper consists of

<p>two parts separated by such punctuation, which will be transcribed. Note that
standard prescribed punctuation separates the title proper from the following
element, even though this may result in double punctuation.
</p>
<p>An alternative title (a second title introduced by &ldquo;or&rdquo; or the equivalent in
another language, e.g., Hans Brinker, or, The silver skates) is part of the title proper.
It is punctuated and capitalized as shown in figure 1-8.
</p>
<p>The entire title proper, including an alternative title, is recorded in subfield &Dagger;a
of the 245 field in the MARC record.
</p>
<p>1.1B2. Transcribe the title proper just as it appears in the chief source of infor-
mation. If the name of the author, the publisher, etc., appears as an integral part
of the title (not simply out of prescribed order, as with figure 1-4), transcribe it as
shown in the 245 field of figure 1-9.
</p>
<p>Note the capitalization in figure 1-9. AACR2 Appendix A.4A1 calls for the
capitalization of the first word of a title proper, alternative title, parallel title, or
quoted title (a title embedded within other text). If a title proper begins with the
author&rsquo;s name in a possessive case (in any language), the cataloger must decide
whether the proper name is the first word of the title (as, for example, Shepherd&rsquo;s
historical atlas), or whether the name introduces a quoted title (e.g., Milton&rsquo;s
Paradise lost) (see the examples in AACR2 Appendix A.4A1 and those given with
AACR2 1.1B2).
</p>
<p>10 GE N E R A L RU L E S F O R DE S C R I P T I O N</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.1B3. The title proper is usually different from the name of the person or
body responsible for the item, but this is not always the case, as seen in figures 
1-10 and 1-11. Transcribe the title information as it appears in the chief source.
</p>
<p>1.1B4. This rule authorizes the abridgment of a long title proper. Caution:
only in rare instances is it appropriate to abbreviate the title proper. In the nine-
teenth century and earlier, title pages were often crowded with extraneous infor-
mation, because they often doubled as an advertisement that was printed as a
broadside and distributed separately. But even in these instances, the title proper
was generally concise. &ldquo;Other title&rdquo; information is more likely to be overly
lengthy and in need of abridgment than is the title proper (see Handbook at 1.1E3
for discussion and example).
</p>
<p>1.1B6. A title proper that includes separate letters or initials, with or without
full stops between them, is transcribed as it appears, without any internal spaces
(see figure 1-1 for transcription of a title including initials with full stops; see
figure 1-12 for a title including initials without full stops between them).
</p>
<p>1.1B7. Items lacking a title. If the cataloger must go beyond the prescribed
sources of information to find a title for an item being cataloged or if the cataloger
makes up a title for an item (typically something homemade), enclose this title in
brackets (see figure 1-13).

<p>1.1C. Optional addition. General material designation
</p>
<p>The general material designation (GMD) is a generic term used to identify the
general category of material to which an item belongs and to distinguish one
general category from another in a catalog containing records for more than one
type of material. The area for physical description (1.5) also describes the special
nature of the item, whether it be a sound recording, a slide, or a printed text. But
catalogers have long felt that it is helpful to alert library users almost immediately
to the fact that some items, such as microfilms or sound recordings, require
special equipment for their use, or that other items, such as maps or pictures, are
stored and handled in a special manner. For this reason, it has been customary in
many North American libraries to add a medium designator immediately fol-
lowing the title proper in the catalog entry for nonbook items.
</p>
<p>AACR2 includes two lists of GMDs, one for libraries in the United Kingdom
and one for other Anglo-American libraries. Two lists are used because in the
United Kingdom there is a strong emphasis on the general character of terms to be
used as GMDs, while elsewhere there is a preference for certain terms even though
they tend to the specific rather than the generic in character. Thus, no single list has
been found to be completely acceptable on both sides of the Atlantic.
</p>
<p>At the time of this writing the use and utility of the GMD is being studied by
the Joint Steering Committee for Revision of Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules
(JSC). Meanwhile, some changes have recently been made to the list of terms in
1.1C1. In the 2001 amendments, under list 1 &ldquo;computer file&rdquo; was replaced with</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ldquo;electronic resource&rdquo;; under list 2 &ldquo;electronic resource&rdquo; replaces &ldquo;computer file,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;cartographic material&rdquo; replaces both &ldquo;map&rdquo; and &ldquo;globe.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>AACR2 is based on the premise of a fully integrated library collection, with
all types of materials being cataloged under the same rules and principles regard-
less of physical format. Following this premise, AACR2 allows the cataloger the
option of adding a general material designation not only to nonprint items, but
also to books. If the cataloger chooses to add GMDs to all types of library materi-
als, figure 1-15 shows how figure 1-5 would be modified.
</p>
<p>For materials currently cataloged by the Library of Congress, LC will add the
following GMDs, as appropriate (LCRI 1.1C, Aug. 2001):
</p>
<p>electronic resource [formerly microform
computer file] motion picture
</p>
<p>graphic [from list 1; replaces filmstrip, sound recording 
slide, and transparency, used by videorecording
LC before 1992]
</p>
<p>This cataloging policy undoubtedly partly represents LC&rsquo;s collecting poli-
cies&mdash;the library simply does not collect some of the types of materials repre-
sented by the other GMDs. The policy of the national libraries of Canada and
Australia is to use any of the terms from list 2, and many U.S. libraries also use
GMDs not on LC&rsquo;s &ldquo;short list.&rdquo; Very few use the following:
</p>
<p>braille manuscript text
cartographic material music
</p>
<p>The Handbook will not add GMDs for these materials. It does use other GMDs
from list 2. All the GMDs are defined in AACR2 Appendix D (Glossary), which
the cataloger should consult. If a library chooses to use other GMDs, its catalogers
should note the following:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;art original&rdquo; includes collages, drawings, paintings, sculpture, and
other one-of-a-kind objects that, in the judgment of the cataloger,
qualify as &ldquo;art&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;realia.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;chart&rdquo; includes graphic and tabular wall charts, flip charts, and calen-
dars, but not cartographic charts; these are regarded as maps (carto-
graphic material).
</p>
<p>&ldquo;picture&rdquo; includes any item covered by rules in AACR2 chapter 8 and
not subsumed under another term from list 2.

<p>1.1D. Parallel titles
</p>
<p>Sometimes the chief source of information shows a repetition of the title proper
in other languages (the item may or may not contain text matching the languages
of the titles). If this is the case, the first title is usually regarded as the title proper
of the item. Succeeding repetitions of this title in the other languages are usually
regarded as parallel titles. Libraries following LC decisions will record parallel
titles according to second-level description: record the first parallel title and any
subsequent parallel title that is in English.
</p>
<p>Parallel titles are separated from the title proper and from one another by
space - equals sign - space (see figure 1-18). The first parallel title is preceded by
subfield &Dagger;b unless subfield &Dagger;b has already occurred.
</p>
<p>1.1D2. Multiple parallel titles are treated differently depending on which
level of description is chosen (see 1.0D). For an example demonstrating 1.1D2 at
all three levels, see figures 1-2a&ndash;c.
</p>
<p>1.1D3. Sometimes the chief source of information for a translated work gives
the original title as well as the title of the translation. This is regarded as a paral-
lel title (separated from the title proper by space - equals sign - space) if the work</p>

<p>includes not only the translated text, but also &ldquo;all or some of the text in the origi-
nal language.&rdquo; In other words, the work must include text in languages to match
the titles as given in the chief source. Figure 1-19 is an example of such a text.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Whether or not a translation includes some of the original text, an original
title will be recorded as a parallel title if it precedes the title proper in the chief
source of information. On the other hand, if the chief source of information for a
translated work includes the original title following the title of the translation and
the work contains only the translation, the title of the translation will be given as
the title proper and the original title will be listed as a note (see figure 1-20).
</p>
<p>Sometimes a work may be reissued under a new title but not translated to
another language. If both the new title and the original title are included in the
chief source of information, record the original title as &ldquo;other title&rdquo; information,
separated from the title proper by space - colon - space (see figure 1-21). However,
if the chief source of information lists only the new title under which a work is
reissued, this is all that will appear in the title element. If the cataloger knows the
original title, this information will appear in a note (AACR2 1.7A4). Information
about earlier titles, original titles, and so on is often found, as in figure 1-22, on
the verso of the title page.

<p>1.1F. Statements of responsibility
</p>
<p>The statement of responsibility is separated from the title by space - slash - space.
Subfield &Dagger;c appears immediately after the slash in the MARC record. There are
generally no further subfields in the 245 field.
</p>
<p>The statement of responsibility is transcribed just as it appears in the chief
source of information. Do not add words such as &ldquo;by&rdquo; or &ldquo;and&rdquo; unless these
appear in the chief source of information. But if these appear in the source, tran-
scribe them as you see them. That is, &ldquo;and&rdquo; must be transcribed as &ldquo;and&rdquo;; the
ampersand &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; will be transcribed as &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; (see figure 1-28).
</p>
<p>A statement of responsibility appearing in the chief source of information will
always be recorded, unless the cataloger is following the provisions of first-level
description (1.0D1) and the statement of responsibility is the same as the main
entry heading. No abbreviations may be used in the statement of responsibility
unless they appear in the item, in which case they are to be transcribed exactly as
they appear. The statement of responsibility may include, in addition to or instead
of names of authors, names of persons or bodies having other responsibility for
the work, such as editors, translators, writers of prefaces, illustrators, etc. Names
of persons or bodies performing different functions are separated from one
another by space - semicolon - space, unless joined grammatically. In addition to
this treatment of punctuation, shown in figure 1-29, note the transcription of ini-
tials in the statement of responsibility. They are to be recorded with full stops if
present in the original source, but without spaces between them.
</p>
<p>Although in most cases all personal names appearing in the chief source of
information will be recorded in the statement of responsibility, the cataloger
should be alert for instances in which an individual&rsquo;s name is included on the
source simply because he or she happens to head an agency responsible for the

<p>Record in the statement of responsibility only names that are of &ldquo;biblio-
graphic significance,&rdquo; that is, names associated with the intellectual and artistic
content of an item (see LCRI 1.1F1, Jan. 5, 1989; NLCRI 1.1F; and AACR2 Ap-
pendix D [Glossary], s.v. &ldquo;Statement of responsibility&rdquo;). Do not record the names
of staff members of publishing companies, such as &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; editors, book and
layout designers, and production managers. Thus, in figure 1-31, K. C. Den
Dooven, the book designer, is not included in the statement of responsibility. A
cataloger familiar with KC Publications will also recognize Mary L. Van Camp as
an &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; editor and exclude her name from the statement of responsibility.
However, if the cataloger is in doubt about the status of a name, he or she should
transcribe it if it appears in the chief source.
</p>
<p>1.1F1. A statement of responsibility will be recorded only if it appears &ldquo;promi-
nently&rdquo; in the item being cataloged. &ldquo;Prominently&rdquo; is defined, according to
AACR2 0.8, as &ldquo;a formal statement found in one of the prescribed sources . . . for
areas 1 and 2&rdquo; (the title and statement of responsibility area and the edition area).
These prescribed sources will be different for each of the various types of media.
They are listed under .0B in AACR2 chapters 2&ndash;12 (e.g., 2.0B2 states that for a
book, the prescribed source of information for the title and statement of respon-
sibility is the title page or title page substitute); in addition, information appear-
ing &ldquo;prominently&rdquo; (i.e., in the prescribed source listed for the edition area) can be
transcribed as part of the statement of responsibility. AACR2 6.0B1 states that the
chief source of information (i.e., the prescribed source of information for tran-
scribing the title and statement of responsibility) for a compact disc is the disc
itself and its label. In addition, a statement appearing &ldquo;prominently&rdquo; (i.e., on
accompanying textual material or the container, the prescribed source for the
edition area) can be transcribed as part of the statement of responsibility (see
6.0B2). If such &ldquo;prominent&rdquo; information (i.e., information taken from prescribed
sources for the edition area) is included as part of the statement of responsibility,
it must be enclosed in square brackets.
</p>
<p>The cataloger should exercise judgment about whether to include &ldquo;promi-
nent&rdquo; information not appearing in the chief source of information as part of the
statement of responsibility. Transcribe it only if it is significant (i.e., of such a</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>nature that an added entry will be made based on the information). In figure 1-32,
data about illustrators appear on the verso of the title page, which, because it is
one of the prescribed sources of information for the edition area, is a &ldquo;prominent&rdquo;
location. The illustrations, however, are relatively unimportant, and responsibil-
ity for these illustrations is diffuse. The information will not be transcribed. On
the other hand, see figure 1-33 for an instance where important information
appearing on the verso of the title page should be bracketed as part of the state-
ment of responsibility.
</p>
<p>1.1F2. Do not construct a statement of responsibility if none appears &ldquo;promi-
nently&rdquo; in the item (see figures 1-30 and 1-34).
</p>
<p>1.1F3. If a statement of responsibility precedes the title proper, transpose it to
its proper position in the entry (see figures 1-4 and 1-24 for examples). However,
if such a name is connected grammatically to the title proper, do not transpose it
(see figure 1-9). In such a case, the statement of responsibility following the slash
may consist solely of names of persons or bodies performing subsidiary func-
tions. Even though it does not include the name of the author, a statement of

<p>responsibility is still to be separated from the title element by space - slash - space
(see again figure 1-9).
</p>
<p>1.1F5. When more than three persons or bodies performing the same function
are named in the source used to record the statement of responsibility, give only
the first named, followed by &ldquo;... [et al.]&rdquo; (see figures 1-33 and 1-35). This is com-
monly known as &ldquo;the rule of three.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>1.1F6. More than one statement of responsibility. Often the chief source of
information lists more than one type of bibliographic responsibility. For example,
in addition to an author&rsquo;s name on the title page of a book, the cataloger may find
names of editors, writers of prefaces or introductions, illustrators, etc. These
names are to be recorded in the order in which they appear in the source (see
figure 1-3). Separate names of persons or bodies having different kinds of respon-
sibility by space - semicolon - space, unless these names are linked grammatically.
</p>
<p>Contrast figure 1-3 with figure 1-35. Names of one to three persons or bodies
performing the same function will be transcribed in the entry; if four or more
perform the same function, all but the first will be omitted. (This holds true for
those performing subsidiary functions such as illustrators, etc., as well as persons
or bodies having primary responsibility for the work.)
</p>
<p>1.1F7. Titles included with names in the statement of responsibility. Certain
titles, if they appear prominently in conjunction with the names of persons, will
be transcribed as part of the catalog entry. Among titles thus to be transcribed are
titles of nobility or British titles of honor (Sir, Dame, Lord, Lady) (see figures 1-36
and 1-37).
</p>
<p>Always transcribe a title of address if it is necessary grammatically (see figure
1-38). Include a title of address, etc., when its omission would leave only the

<p>will be omitted when the name includes a surname and forename(s) (see figure

responsibility in figure 1-45.
</p>
<p>1.1F8. Additions to statement of responsibility. As previously mentioned,
the cataloger is not to add words such as &ldquo;by&rdquo; or &ldquo;and&rdquo; that simply serve to link
the statement of responsibility to the title or one collaborating author with
another, unless these words are found in the chief source of information.
However, if the statement of responsibility as it appears in the source is not clear,
or perhaps is misleading, a word or short phrase may be added to clarify it (see
figure 1-46).
</p>
<p>1.1F12. If a word appearing in the source of information (or a word added to
a statement of responsibility according to directions in 1.1F8) is to appear as part
of the statement of responsibility, it should be &ldquo;indicative of the role of the
person(s) or body (bodies) named in the statement of responsibility rather than of
the nature of the work.&rdquo; A noun or noun phrase &ldquo;indicative of the nature of the
work&rdquo; is to be regarded as other title information. Such nouns typically are as
follows: an anthology, a report, a collection, a tribute, etc. Note the example
shown in figure 1-47.
</p>
<p>A word of caution: while it is true that a participle (edited, written, collected,
etc.) is generally indicative of the role of the person and a noun is generally
indicative of the nature of the work, this is not always the case. Sometimes a noun

<p>indicates the role of the person, and when it does, the noun should be included as
part of the statement of responsibility. In figure 1-19 the phrase &ldquo;the Sanskrit text&rdquo;
is part of the statement of responsibility because it is less indicative of the nature
of the work as a whole (which includes both the Sanskrit text and the English
translation) than it is indicative of the role of the translator, telling what he trans-
lated. In this case the layout of the title page also indicates that the phrase should
be transcribed in the statement of responsibility.
</p>
<p>1.1F13. If the author&rsquo;s name is transcribed as part of the title element under
AACR2 1.1B2, it is not necessary for the cataloger to bracket in a further author
statement. The chief source of information is transcribed as it appears. However,
if, in addition to the author&rsquo;s name appearing in the title, the name also appears
in a separate statement of responsibility in the chief source of information, this is
transcribed (see figure 1-48).
</p>
<p>1.1F14. Statements that would be considered statements of authorship if a
person or body were named are transcribed. &ldquo;Unnamed bodies&rdquo; are included as
part of the statement of responsibility, even though, according to the catalogers&rsquo;
definition (AACR2 21.1B1), such corporate bodies cannot be said to function as a
unit and will not be given an entry in the catalog (see figure 1-49).
</p>
<p>But note the inclusion of &ldquo;words or phrases that are neither names nor linking
words&rdquo; when they are concise and when they provide useful bibliographical
information. In the example shown in figure 1-50, &ldquo;compiled in June 1946&rdquo; should
be retained. The names of the heads of the two agencies listed as part of the state-
ment of responsibility are omitted because they had no authorship responsibility
for the work (see also figure 1-30).

<p>A word of caution: excluded from provisions of 1.1F14 are statements of this
nature that deal with illustrations. For these, see 1.1F15.
</p>
<p>1.1F15. This rule has been interpreted by the Library of Congress as follows:
&ldquo;When illustration statements such as &lsquo;117 photogravure plates, 26 colour plates,&rsquo;
&lsquo;with 115 illustrations,&rsquo; &lsquo;illustrated with 10 woodcuts,&rsquo; etc., appear in the chief
source, omit them unless (1) an artist or illustrator is named in the phrase, or (2)
the phrase is inseparable from the title proper or other title information&rdquo; (LCRI
1.1F15, Jan. 5, 1989; see also NLCRI 1.1F15).
</p>
<p>Thus, the cataloger should only include an illustration statement as part of
the statement of responsibility if it names the person responsible for the illustra-
tions (see figures 1-25, 1-51, and 1-52 for examples of the omission of an illustra-
tion statement found in the chief source).
</p>
<p>In contrast to the examples of omission of illustration statement (figures 1-51
and 1-52), a statement of responsibility will be transcribed if it includes a phrase
referring to a person, even though the person is not specifically named in the
statement (see figure 1-53).
</p>
<p>The chief source of information sometimes includes extraneous matter such
as mottoes and bits of verse. If these have no connection with the bibliographical
information needed to identify the item, they should be ignored (see figures 1-31
and 1-44). Do not use ellipses to indicate their omission.

<p>Figure 1-54 includes two extraneous pieces of information that the cataloger
will properly ignore in transcribing the title and statement of responsibility area.
The first one, which follows the author&rsquo;s name, states that this work won a prize
in a contest sponsored by the Biblioteca Nacional in 1906 and that it has been
printed at the expense of the national government. The second is a quotation from
the Spanish author Lorenzo Ortiz claiming that the Spanish people have pro-
duced the best writers in the world. Neither statement has any place in the bibli-
ographic framework of the catalog entry.

<p>1.1G. Items without a collective title
</p>
<p>Most items that include a number of separate works have a collective title on the
chief source of information. Such materials present no problem for the cataloger.
But some items simply list a number of separate titles, with or without their
authors, on the chief source of information. AACR2 1.1G gives rules for tran-
scription of such materials. 1.1G1 deals with the relatively rare instance in which
one of the separate works named in the chief source of an item without a collec-
tive title is predominant. An example of such a work is found in figure 1-55,
which gives prominence to the first item by the typography. However, as noted in
LCRI 1.1G1 (Mar. 5, 1990), application of this rule is usually to be restricted to
&ldquo;cases in which the secondary titles do not appear in the same source as the pre-
dominant title.&rdquo; In most instances, record such titles according to rule 1.1G3.
</p>
<p>1.1G2. AACR2 gives the cataloger a choice when cataloging items lacking a
collective title, in which no one work predominates. The cataloger may either
catalog the item on a single record, or catalog each work on separate records. The
Library of Congress restricts the separate record approach to cartographic mate-
rials, microforms, and rare materials, and then only when the &ldquo;solution seems
better in the particular situation.&rdquo; All other materials are to use the single record
approach (LCRI 1.1G2, June 2002). The National Library of Canada allows multi-
ple records in the case of microforms (NLCRI 1.1G2 and 11.1G4).

<p>One situation where the multiple record approach might make sense is with
&ldquo;dos-&agrave;-dos&rdquo; style books, where two novels are published together back to back&mdash;
literally&mdash;so that the reader has to turn the book over after reading one novel in
order to read the other. With such books it is often impossible to tell which is the
first novel and which the second. Under the national libraries&rsquo; approach, the cat-
aloger would need to make an arbitrary decision which to record first, as in figure
1-56a. The pair of records produced using the multiple record approach is shown
in figure 1-56b.
</p>
<p>1.1G3. If a title page lacks a collective title, record each of the titles in the order
in which they are given. Separate the titles by semicolons, even if they are joined
by a connecting word or phrase. Precede the second title (including a connecting
word or phrase) by subfield &Dagger;b (see figure 1-57). If the separate parts are by dif-
ferent authors, give each title with its statement of responsibility. Separate each
part by a full stop, as shown in figure 1-56a. Do not insert any subfield coding
subsequent to the first statement of responsibility.

<p>1.2. EDITION AREA
</p>
<p>An edition may be defined as being &ldquo;one of the differing forms in which a . . . work
. . . is published, e.g., as applied to text, original, revised, enlarged, corrected, etc. 
. . . ; [or] as applied to format: de luxe, library, paperbound, large-paper, illustrated,
etc.&rdquo;5 The AACR2 defines edition for printed matter as &ldquo;all copies produced from
essentially the same type image . . . and issued by the same entity,&rdquo; with similar
definitions for other formats (see AACR2 Appendix D, s.v. &ldquo;edition&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>The cataloger is required to include the edition statement as found, but a
statement such as &ldquo;35th impression&rdquo; or &ldquo;9th printing&rdquo; may be ignored, because it
usually simply means that more copies of the work have been made (neither the
type image nor the issuing entity have changed). Such a statement would only be
recorded if the cataloger knew that there was some significant difference, either in
content or format, between one printing or impression and another.
</p>
<p>Printers and publishers have no regard for the cataloger&rsquo;s convenience in
their use of bibliographical terminology. Not even when the publisher uses the
word &ldquo;edition&rdquo; or its equivalent in another language can the cataloger assume
that the work in hand is indeed different from other issues of the work. This is
especially true in regard to many French and Latin American publications. The
cataloger is not required to compare copies to verify the validity of an edition
statement. Take the word &ldquo;edition&rdquo; or its equivalent at face value and record it as
it appears (see figure 1-58). The edition statement is transcribed in the 250 field of
the MARC record.
</p>
<p>1.2B3. This rule simply reiterates long-standing cataloging practice: in case of
doubt, if a statement appears to be an edition statement, record it in the edition area.
</p>
<p>However, not all items include an edition statement. Do not add &ldquo;1st ed.&rdquo; or
any other such statement unless you find it in your source (but see 1.2B4,

<p>&ldquo;Optional addition&rdquo;). On the other hand, if the item includes an edition state-
ment, transcribe the wording and order just as you find it. Thus, if the item reads:
</p>
<p>Second edition, revised and corrected
</p>
<p>transcription will be:
</p>
<p>250 &Dagger;a 2nd ed., rev. and corr.
</p>
<p>However, if the edition statement reads:
</p>
<p>Revised and corrected second edition
</p>
<p>transcription will be:
</p>
<p>250 &Dagger;a Rev. and corr. 2nd ed.
</p>
<p>Note in the preceding examples the use of abbreviations and the transcription
of numbers spelled as words to arabic ordinal numerals. Recall that no abbrevia-
tions are allowed in the title and statement of responsibility area. Beginning with
the edition area, abbreviations should be used when the word is found in AACR2
Appendix B (Abbreviations) (all sections except B.13). Numbers written as words
or as roman numerals are to be transcribed as arabic numerals, following direc-
tions in AACR2 Appendix C (Numerals).
</p>
<p>1.2B4. Optional addition. The cataloger is given the option of adding, in brack-
ets, a made-up edition statement if he or she knows that the work being cataloged
includes &ldquo;significant changes from other editions.&rdquo; The Library of Congress rarely
follows this practice, because it puts a considerable burden of research and com-
parison on the cataloger. It will, however, apply the option if the differences are
&ldquo;manifest&rdquo; and the statement is necessary to distinguish between otherwise iden-
tical descriptions (LCRI 1.2B4, Jan. 5, 1989). The National Library of Australia

<p>applies the option in the same way (National Library of Australia, ABN Cataloguing
Manual, available at &lt;http://www.nla.gov.au/kinetica/manuals/catman.html&gt;,
1.2B4 [hereinafter NLARI]). The National Library of Canada does not apply the
option (NLCRI 1.2B4).
</p>
<p>1.2C. Statements of responsibility relating to the edition
</p>
<p>Occasionally an edition statement is followed by a statement of responsibility
pertaining only to the edition in hand (e.g., it may name a reviser, an illustrator,
or someone who has performed some other function just for the particular
edition). If this is the case, such a statement of responsibility will be transcribed,
following space - slash - space, as part of the edition area. Precede the statement
of responsibility by subfield &Dagger;b. In transcribing this statement of responsibility,
follow all applicable rules for transcription, punctuation, spacing, etc., as given in
1.1F. Unlike the edition statement proper, no abbreviations not appearing in the
source may be used in recording the statement of responsibility (see figure 1-59).
</p>
<p>1.2C2. Many works that lack a formal edition statement are clearly revisions
of an earlier work. A cataloger who chooses to follow the option given in 1.2B4
may create an edition statement and include the statement of revision as a state-
ment of responsibility following the bracketed edition statement, if this statement
relates to the edition in hand but not to all editions of the work (see example given
in AACR2 under 1.2C1). When in doubt, however, do not do this. In almost every
case, if the item does not include an edition statement, information about revi-
sion, etc., of the text will form part of the title and statement of responsibility area
(see figure 1-60).

</p>
<p>1.2D. Statement relating to a named revision of an edition
</p>
<p>This rule gives guidance about what to do when an item includes more than one
edition statement. Both statements are included in the edition area, separated by
a comma; the first word of each statement is capitalized unless it is a number (see
figure 1-61).
</p>
<p>In most cases a reissue is identical to the first printing of a particular edition.
Note information about a reissue as a subsequent edition statement only if the
reissue contains significant changes. This will not often be the case.
</p>
<p>1.3. MATERIAL (OR TYPE OF PUBLICATION) SPECIFIC DETAILS AREA
</p>
<p>This area appears in catalog entries for cartographic materials, music, electronic
resources, and continuing resources (see discussion in this Handbook, chapters 3,
5, 9, and 12 for examples and explanation).
</p>
<p>1.4. Publication, Distribution, etc., Area
</p>
<p>For information included in this area, the basic order and punctuation are Place
[i.e., City] : Publisher, date. This area is transcribed in the 260 field of the MARC
record.
</p>
<p>1.4B4. This rule is based on one of the cardinal principles of descriptive cata-
loging: transcribe what you see. However, the publication, etc., area includes
several exceptions to this principle. Some words are normally omitted from the
transcription of information in this area. Thus, prepositional phrases may be
omitted unless case endings would be affected (see figure 1-62).

<p>1.4C. Place of publication, distribution, etc.
</p>
<p>1.4C1. The place name is transcribed in subfield &Dagger;a. Do not translate a place name
into an English-language form that might be more familiar to English-speaking
users of your library. Transcribe the name as you find it. That is, if the chief source
of information gives &ldquo;Milano,&rdquo; do not translate it to &ldquo;Milan&rdquo; (see figure 1-63).
</p>
<p>1.4C2. However, if the place as transcribed seems likely to be obscure to your
library&rsquo;s users, you may, at your discretion, add a more familiar form in brackets
(see figure 1-64).
</p>
<p>1.4C3. Additions to place names. This rule directs the cataloger to add the
name of the larger jurisdiction (country, state, province, etc.) to the name of the
city of publication &ldquo;if it is considered necessary for identification, or if it is con-
sidered necessary to distinguish the place from others of the same name.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Many of the major publishers of the world are located in large cities, such as
New York, Chicago, London, etc. As illustrated by figure 1-65, title pages or other
sources for transcription of publication information customarily give the names
of such well-known cities without including the larger jurisdiction (e.g., state). By
long-standing cataloger custom, names of these well-known cities are transcribed
in the publication area without further addition.
</p>
<p>It is left up to the cataloger&rsquo;s judgment to determine whether a larger juris-
diction appearing in the prescribed source should be transcribed after the name
of the place.6 If the cataloger chooses to transcribe a larger jurisdiction appearing
in the prescribed source, abbreviations found in AACR2 Appendix B should be
used. Thus, if the source gives Tucson, Arizona, as the place, the cataloger will
transcribe Tucson, Ariz. Note, however, that if an abbreviation appears in the pre-
scribed source it should not be changed. If the source reads Tucson, AZ, transcribe

<p>Following the general guidelines of AACR2 1.4C3, if the name of the larger
jurisdiction does not appear together with the place of publication in the source
from which transcription is made and if the city is not well known, or conflicts
with the name of another city, the larger jurisdiction should be added in square
brackets by the cataloger (see, for example, figure 1-20: England should be added
in order to identify the city of Henley on Thames).
</p>
<p>1.4C5. Two or more places of publication. As a general rule, the publication
area includes one place (city) and one publisher, distributor, etc. Normally, if a
work is published in more than one city, the cataloger transcribes only the first
named place from the prescribed source for the publication area (see figure 1-68).
</p>
<p>The cataloger will add a second place if a city outside the cataloger&rsquo;s country
(for most readers of this text, the United States) is named first, followed by a city
in the &ldquo;home&rdquo; country (see figure 1-69).
</p>
<p>Note that publication area information generated under the stipulations of
this rule will vary, depending on the country of the cataloging agency. Referring
again to figure 1-69, a Dutch library would transcribe the publication area:
</p>
<p>260 &Dagger;a Dordrecht : &Dagger;b Kluwer Academic Publishers, &Dagger;c c1989.
</p>
<p>(The first city is in the home country.) A British library would transcribe it:
</p>
<p>260 &Dagger;a Dordrecht [Netherlands] ; &Dagger;a London : &Dagger;b Kluwer Academic
Publishers, &Dagger;c c1989.
</p>
<p>(The first place is transcribed, followed by the place in the cataloger&rsquo;s home
country.) A cataloger in Australia or any other country other than the three coun-
tries specified above would give publication area as:
</p>
<p>260 &Dagger;a Dordrecht [Netherlands] : &Dagger;b Kluwer Academic Publishers, &Dagger;c c1989.
</p>
<p>(No place in home country; list first place only.)
To summarize: always transcribe the first place. If this place is a city outside
</p>
<p>the country of your cataloging agency and if the item includes the name of a city
in your home country, transcribe this second city also.

</p>
<p>This practice holds true even if the name of the &ldquo;home&rdquo; city appears in a dif-
ferent place in the item than the source being used to transcribe the publication
data. Prescribed sources should be used in the order in which they are listed in
.0B2 of the appropriate AACR2 chapter; for example, for the publication area of
an item cataloged under chapter 2, use title page information first, supplement-
ing it with information from other preliminaries and finally the colophon, if
appropriate (see figure 1-70).
</p>
<p>1.4C6. For published materials, the place of publication element in the publi-
cation area must always contain something. If the name of the place does not
appear on the item, it may be taken from appropriate reference sources or other
materials.
</p>
<p>In the example shown in figure 1-71, the Directory of Inter-Corporate Ownership
(New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1974; v. 1, p. 833) gives the information that in 1972
MGM Records was a subsidiary of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in Culver City, Cali-
fornia. The place is definite. If the cataloger is not certain of the place, he or she
may give a probable city with a question mark. Always use the English form of
the name in these situations.
</p>
<p>The cataloger need not do extensive research to learn the location of a pub-
lisher. However, if the reference sources are at hand, they should be used. In addi-
tion, the place can often be discovered in an online system by searching for other
records containing the publisher&rsquo;s name.

<p>The cataloger may, if a probable city is not known but a probable country or
state is, give the country or state alone as the place element. The rationale for this
rule is plain; the addition of a country or state name is preferable to the third
alternative, adding &ldquo;[S.l.]&rdquo; (sine loco, meaning &ldquo;without place&rdquo;), which is done if
the cataloger has no idea at all where the item originated. Under no other

<p>circumstances is state or country ever given alone in the publication area. In all but
this instance, &ldquo;place&rdquo; means city or town.
</p>
<p>The book used as the basis of figure 1-72 illustrates several cataloging prob-
lems. As can be seen from the facsimile of the title page, no publication informa-
tion is given in the chief source of information. A careful search of the volume
failed to turn up any hint as to place of publication or name of either publisher or
printer. The only indication of date of publication is the statement in the preface
that &ldquo;Mrs. W. J. Crowley of Kingman is now serving (1944).&rdquo; This is enough evi-
dence for the cataloger to bracket [1944?] as publication date (see AACR2 1.4F7).
</p>
<p>As for place of publication, the Arizona Federation of Women&rsquo;s Clubs has
never had a permanent headquarters, and so no help can come from this source.
Furthermore, nothing in the book suggests that the federation served as publisher
of the book, although this is highly probable. The author&rsquo;s place of residence is
not known. However, it is an entirely reasonable supposition that she lived in
Arizona when the book was issued and that the book was printed and published
somewhere in Arizona. Therefore, the name of the state should be used alone as
place of publication, qualified with a question mark because the information is
not certain.
</p>
<p>1.4C7. The cataloger may optionally add the full address of the publisher to the
name of the place. Library of Congress catalogers will add full address on a case-
by-case basis when information is readily available for items covered by AACR2
chapters 2 and 5, published in the United States within the last three years, and
that do not bear an ISBN or an ISSN (LCRI 1.4C7, Jan. 5, 1989). The National
Library of Canada and the National Library of Australia will not apply the option
(NLCRI 1.4C7, NLARI 1.4C7).

<p>1.4D. Name of publisher, distributor, etc.
</p>
<p>1.4D1. The name of the publisher, distributor, etc., is the second element of the
publication area. It is separated from the first element (place of publication) by
space - colon - space and preceded by subfield &Dagger;b.
</p>
<p>1.4D2. The publisher&rsquo;s or distributor&rsquo;s name is shortened in the publication
area as much as possible, but not so much that it duplicates the name of another
publisher or that it cannot be identified internationally. Previous catalog codes
gave elaborate guidelines for shortening publishers&rsquo; names. The present rules are
not as explicit. The cataloger must have a knowledge of publishers not only in the
United States but also abroad to know that A. S. Barnes &amp; Co. must be distin-
guished from John W. Barnes, Jr. Publishing, Inc., and therefore that one must be
A. S. Barnes in the one publication statement and J. W. Barnes in the other. On the
other hand, W. H. Freeman and Co. can be shortened to Freeman, because there
is only one Freeman in the publishing business. Books in Print and its British coun-
terpart have publisher lists that can be used to ascertain whether a publisher&rsquo;s
name is unique and therefore susceptible to being truncated to a single word.
</p>
<p>A few guidelines can be given.
</p>
<p>1. Omit the initial article.
The Canadian Record becomes Canadian Record.
</p>
<p>2. Normally omit terms meaning &ldquo;incorporated&rdquo; or &ldquo;limited.&rdquo;
Caxton Printers, Ltd. becomes Caxton Printers.
</p>
<p>Artabras, Inc. becomes Artabras.
3. Omit words or phrases that show the publisher function.
</p>
<p>Bindford &amp; Mort, Publishers is shortened to Bindford &amp; Mort.
4. Omit words that simply indicate commercial organization.
</p>
<p>Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. is shortened to Dodd, Mead.
Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc. Macmillan.
Charles Scribner&rsquo;s Sons Scribner.
Penguin Books Penguin.
</p>
<p>Use care in shortening names; do not change the meaning of the phrase.
The Horn Book, Inc. is only shortened to Horn Book.
</p>
<p>5. Unless two or more publishers have the same surname, forenames of well-
known publishers may be omitted entirely.
</p>
<p>Thomas Y. Crowell Co., Inc. is shortened to Crowell.
Alternately, and perhaps more safely, forenames may be shortened to 
initials.
</p>
<p>Frederick Warne &amp; Co., Ltd. is shortened to F. Warne.
Now a word of caution. Certain elements of firm names may not be short-
</p>
<p>ened.
</p>
<p>1. Never omit multiple surnames. Transcribe what appears on the chief source
of information with which you are working. These surname combinations
may vary from one book to another.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Harper &amp; Brothers, Publishers is shortened to Harper.
Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. Harper &amp; Row.
Coward, McCann &amp; Geoghegan, Inc. Coward, McCann 
</p>
<p>&amp; Geoghegan.
2. Do not shorten a firm name when the entire name is descriptive of the type
</p>
<p>of material produced by the firm or of its viewpoint.
Aviation Book Co. is not shortened.
Architectural Book Pub. Co. is not shortened.
The Feminist Press becomes Feminist Press.
Random House, Inc. becomes Random House.
</p>
<p>(The name is indicative of the founder&rsquo;s desire to choose titles for publi-
cation &ldquo;at random.&rdquo;)
</p>
<p>Remember that this is left entirely up to the cataloger&rsquo;s judgment, who
should not agonize over the decision but do what is most &ldquo;efficient and effective
in the particular case&rdquo; (see LCRI 1.4D2, Dec. 11, 1989).
</p>
<p>Occasionally the name of the publisher, distributor, etc., is given in the pre-
scribed source in more than one language. AACR2 1.4D2 stipulates that the cata-
loger is to record the form that is in the language of the title proper (see figure 1-73).
</p>
<p>Sometimes the name of a publisher is part of a hierarchy. For commercial pub-
lishers only, omit parts of the hierarchy that are not needed for identification (see,
for example, figure 1-74).
</p>
<p>1.4D3. Words and phrases to be retained in publisher, distributor, etc.,
element. Sometimes, as in figure 1-75, the prescribed source includes a phrase
indicating that the corporate body named in the publication area has performed
a function other than publishing. This phrase should be transcribed.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the following may not be omitted from the name of a publisher,
distributor, etc.:
</p>
<p>3. Words or phrases needed to indicate a function other than publishing per-
formed by a body.
</p>
<p>Asia House Gallery remains the same.
American Camping Association remains the same.
American Library Association remains the same.
Boston Public Library remains the same.
</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;press&rdquo; needs careful consideration. Literally, it indicates a printing
function, yet many publishers who do no printing include the word &ldquo;press&rdquo; as
part of their corporate name. Furthermore, the word &ldquo;press&rdquo; sometimes is needed
to differentiate between two different corporate bodies; for example:
</p>
<p>University of Illinois Press remains the same.
(The University of Illinois may also be a publisher.)
</p>
<p>Yet &ldquo;press&rdquo; may be omitted from the names of such publishers as
</p>
<p>The Viking Press, Inc. which becomes Viking.
Bradbury Press, Inc. which becomes Bradbury.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>GE N E R A L RU L E S F O R DE S C R I P T I O N 57
</p>
<p>Phrases or words that simply indicate a publishing function should be
omitted (see figure 1-61).
</p>
<p>[Former 1.4D4.] Previous to 2002, if the name of the publisher, etc., appeared
in the title and statement of responsibility area in &ldquo;recognizable&rdquo; form, it could be
radically shortened in the publication area. For example, the publisher in figure
1-33 would have been shortened to A.L.A. because its name appeared in the state-
ment of responsibility area. The publisher statement for the Memoirs of the American
Philosophical Society, published by the American Philosophical Society, would simply
have been recorded &ldquo;The Society.&rdquo; This rule was deleted in the 2002 revision.

<p>Henceforth, the presence or absence of the publisher&rsquo;s name in the title and state-
ment of responsibility area has no bearing on its form in the publication area. The
advent of field-specific keyword searching is partially responsible for the elimi-
nation of this long-standing practice. Library users looking for publications of the
American Philosophical Society by searching its name in the 260 field are not
helped by records that only contain &ldquo;The Society&rdquo; in that field.

<p>names are linked, as frequently happens when the first name is that of a distrib-
utor, releasing agent, etc., and the second is that of the publisher (see figure 1-77).
The name of a subsequently named publisher and its place will also be recorded
if the first named publisher is outside the cataloger&rsquo;s home country and the sub-
sequently named publisher is in the home country. This parallels rule 1.4C5 (see
figures 1-57 and 1-70).
</p>
<p>Motion pictures and videorecordings frequently have more than one distrib-
utor, releasing agent, etc., involved with the publication of such a work. In many
instances it is appropriate to add a second named place, distributor, releasing
agent, etc. (see figure 1-78).
</p>
<p>1.4D6. Publisher not known. Except when cataloging unpublished items (see
AACR2 1.4D8), something must always appear in the publisher, etc., element of the
publication area. If the cataloger does not know and cannot infer the name of the
publisher, the abbreviation &ldquo;s.n.&rdquo; (sine nomine, meaning &ldquo;without a name&rdquo;) in brack-
ets is transcribed following the place element and before the date (see figure 1-79).
</p>
<p>Not all publications include a conventionally arranged title page or other
chief source. For a book, the title page usually includes the name of the publisher
near the bottom of the page. However, sometimes the title page lacks such infor-
mation. In these cases, if a corporate body is named at the head of title, it may be</p>

for which a privately printed work has been issued as the publisher, whether
named as such in the work or not (see figure 1-80).
</p>
<p>It is not always possible to ascertain without research and correspondence
whether a corporate body listed in one of the appropriate sources of information

<p>tributes, sells, etc., books, music, etc.) rather than simply as a printer or manufac-
turer. Many publishers include the word &ldquo;press&rdquo; as a part of their names; some of
these &ldquo;presses&rdquo; have no facilities for printing; others do. In case of doubt, it is
better to record the name of an agency appearing in one of the prescribed sources
for the publisher statement rather than use &ldquo;s.n.&rdquo; in the statement, although in
reality the agency may only have functioned as a printer (see figure 1-81).
</p>
<p>In the absence of indications to the contrary, a government printer or printing
office is to be recorded as a publisher (see figure 1-50 and LCRI 1.4D1, Jan. 5, 1989).
</p>
<p>1.4D8. For many items that are one-of-a-kind materials not intended for
widespread distribution, the name of a publisher, etc., as well as the listing of a
place of publication is inappropriate. Simply omit both of these elements from the
publication statement. Do not record &ldquo;s.l.&rdquo; or &ldquo;s.n.&rdquo; (see, for example, figure 1-13
and discussion in Handbook chapter 10, at 10.4).

<p>a publication run at one time from a set of photographic plates, type, etc.
Frequently, if the publication sells well, the publisher will decide at a later date to
run more copies from the same plates or forms of type. Customarily, although not
always, a second run of a publication will be referred to as a &ldquo;second impression&rdquo;
or &ldquo;second printing.&rdquo; This information will usually be printed, possibly along
with a date, on the title page or its verso. Generally speaking, succeeding impres-
sions or printings are identical to the first; catalogers treat them as copies of the
first impression of that particular edition. As discussed above under 1.2, these
impression or printing statements are usually ignored in the edition area. They
are likewise ignored in the publication area, as in figure 1-82. Except for the verso
of the title page, this book is a photographic reprint of the 1889 edition. Because
it is a book in relatively high demand, it has been reprinted in this way every few
years. The date for any of these impressions should be recorded in the 260 field as
1889. If a library feels it is important to record which printing it has, the cataloger
may include a note in a 590 field such as &ldquo;The library&rsquo;s copy is the 2002 impres-
sion.&rdquo; Alternately, if the library does not have copies with differing impression
dates, the cataloger may add &ldquo;(2002 printing)&rdquo; after the date in the 260 field.

<p>Sometimes, as shown in figure 1-82, specific statements indicating a date of
publication will be found in the item being cataloged. A statement such as &ldquo;First
Schocken Edition 1968,&rdquo; which appears as part of the cataloging data for figure 
1-29, is also evidence of publication date for a particular edition.
</p>
<p>Few items include such a specific statement of publication date, however. If
no such statement appears, the cataloger simply records whatever information is
available in the prescribed source for publication area information. A date appear-
ing in the imprint position on the title page may normally be accepted as the pub-
lication date, particularly if it is the same as the copyright date given on the verso
of the title page, as is the case in figure 1-83.
</p>
<p>The date in the publication area is limited to the year of publication. Do not
transcribe month, day, etc., even if this information is found on the chief source of
information. The date is always transcribed in arabic numerals, even if it is found
in the chief source in roman numerals (see figure 1-61).
</p>
<p>1.4F5. Optional addition. The latest copyright date is not always the same as the
actual date of publication. This rule allows the option of recording the latest copy-
right date if it is different from the publication date. The Library of Congress
applies this option to all materials except books and printed serials (LCRI 1.4F5,
Dec. 11, 1989). Examples in this text follow the LCRI, figure 1-84 being one. The
National Library of Australia and the National Library of Canada apply the
option to all materials (NLARI 1.4F5, NLCRI 1.4F5). These libraries would have
recorded the 260 field of figure 1-84 as follows:

<p>the Library of Congress will ignore the copyright renewal dates, giving only the
original copyright date (LCRI 1.4F6, Feb. 2001).
</p>
<p>1.4F7. Except for naturally occurring objects (see AACR2 1.4F9 and discussion
in this Handbook at 10.4F2), continuing resources, and multipart monographs (see
1.4F8), the publication, distribution, etc., area must always include a date, even if it
can only be a conjectural interpolation by the cataloger. All dates taken from other
than prescribed sources, whether derived from the item, reference sources, or the
cataloger&rsquo;s conjecture, must be bracketed. (See the various chapters in AACR2 for
specific kinds of library materials. In each chapter, rule .0B2 prescribes the sources
from which data may be taken without bracketing.) If no date can be transcribed
from any source, then the cataloger must guess at the date. In such a case the cat-
aloger&rsquo;s interpolation is not only enclosed within square brackets, but also dis-
played as one type of conjecture or another: [1971 or 1972], [1969?], [ca. 1960], [197-],
etc. In the example shown in figure 1-86, the date was taken from the preface.
</p>
<p>Usually the cataloger cannot find a dated preface to use for the year of publi-
cation. In the example shown in figure 1-75, the title itself is evidence that the

<p>book cannot have been published before 1967. Because the book is not copy-
righted, there is no copyright statement to refer to. The table of contents lists
President Johnson&rsquo;s speeches with the dates of delivery, ranging between January
10 and May 25, 1967. It is possible, though not likely, that this book could have
appeared toward the end of 1967. But the LC catalog card number is listed as 
68-23394 on the verso of the title page. The first two digits of the LC number from
this period normally stand for the last two digits of the year in which the pub-
lisher applied for a preassigned number. It is rather likely that the book appeared
in 1968. Therefore the date is recorded in the catalog entry as [1968?].
</p>
<p>Few books furnish this much internal evidence about probable date of publi-
cation. Particularly when dealing with nineteenth-century reprint editions, the
cataloger may fail to find the slightest clue to the date. Under normal circum-
stances the cataloger will not search beyond the item itself. But, as with the
example shown in figure 1-87, it is only sensible to do the minimum amount of
research necessary to discover that Mayne Reid (1818&ndash;1883) was a nineteenth-
century American writer of stories for boys and that The Young Voyageurs first
appeared in 1853, which gives at least a minimum parameter for the date. Both
Dutton and Routledge were well-established nineteenth-century publishers. Reid&rsquo;s
novels were widely reprinted until the end of the nineteenth century but lost pop-
ularity after that. Therefore, one can make a safe guess that this edition appeared
in the nineteenth century, but, without more research than the item warrants, one
cannot say more.
</p>
<p>1.4F8. This rule was completely rewritten with the 2002 revision of AACR2 to
incorporate serials and integrating resources, in addition to multipart mono-
graphs. The 2002 revision introduces a new standard: the cataloger must have
either the first or the last issue, iteration, or part (it must be &ldquo;available&rdquo;) in order
to record anything at all in the date of publication element of this area. If the first
or last part is not &ldquo;available,&rdquo; this element is simply omitted.
</p>
<p>If the first and/or last issue is not available and if information about the
beginning and/or ending date is known, it is recorded in a note. This note is

<p>recorded in a 362 field. This is a familiar field to serials catalogers, but new to
monographic cataloging. The note in the first example after the second paragraph
of 1.4F8 would appear as follows:
</p>
<p>362 1 &Dagger;a Began in 1996.
</p>
<p>Optionally, this information may be recorded in the publication area in square
brackets. The Library of Congress will apply this option on a case-by-case basis
for integrating resources and multipart monographs. Following long-standing
practice, LC will not apply the option to serials (LCRI 1.4F8, fall 2002).
</p>
<p>LC has introduced the useful practice of recording &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; dates as well
in this area for multipart monographs. A temporary date is the date of an inter-
mediate part, published between the first and the last part (which are the &ldquo;per-
manent&rdquo; dates) (LCRI 1.4F8, June 2002). The work illustrated in figure 1-88 is an
incomplete multipart monograph; the date of the last part is unknown because it
has not been published yet. As shown, the temporary date is recorded in angle
brackets (see LCRI 1.0C, Nov. 2003).
</p>
<p>Records for incomplete serials, integrating resources, or multipart mono-
graphs are known as &ldquo;open entry&rdquo; because they do not contain &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;
beginning and ending dates. When the resource is finally completed (this may
take a number of years, or may never occur with some resources), the cataloger
adds the ending date and closes the entry (see figure 1-89).

<p>A word of caution: obviously, the cataloger will not &ldquo;close&rdquo; an entry unless he
or she has evidence that the work is complete or that no more will be published. In
addition, the cataloger must be aware that not all bibliographical resources are
issued beginning with part 1. The date in the publication area is the earliest followed
by the latest date of publication, whether or not the earliest date is the date of part 1.
</p>
<p>1.4G. Place of manufacture, name of manufacturer, date of manufacture
</p>
<p>Information about manufacture will be given if possible when the name of the
publisher is not known. See also AACR2 1.4D7 for guidance in this matter.
</p>
<p>1.4G4. The cataloger may optionally add the place, name, date of manufac-
ture, printing, etc., in addition to the place, name, and date of publication if, in the
opinion of the cataloging agency, this information is considered important. One
instance in which this optional rule might be followed would be the addition of a
date of printing to the date of publication when significant changes have been
made in the particular printing. The national libraries will follow this optional
rule when it seems appropriate (LCRI 1.4G4, Jan. 5, 1989; NLCRI 1.4G4; NLARI
1.4G4).

<p>1.5. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AREA
</p>
<p>The physical description area includes, as applicable, four elements:
</p>
<p>1. The extent of the item and the specific type of material being described
2. Other physical data such as color, type of illustrations, etc.
3. Physical dimensions (size)
4. Accompanying materials, if any.
</p>
<p>1.5A1. Punctuation. The physical description area is recorded in the 300 field
of the MARC record. The first element begins with subfield &Dagger;a and is separated
from the second by space - colon - space. The second element begins with subfield
&Dagger;b and is separated from the third by space - semicolon - space. The third element,
size, is recorded in subfield &Dagger;c. It is normally the last element in the physical
description area, but if the item includes accompanying materials, description of
these materials will be separated from the third element by space - plus sign -
space. This fourth element is preceded by subfield &Dagger;e.
</p>
<p>The physical description area, because it describes the physical format of the
item being cataloged, is unique for each type of library material. For this reason,
specific rules have been set forth for the physical description area of each type of
material, following general principles of AACR2 chapter 1. Examples and further
discussion of the physical description area will be found in succeeding chapters
of this Handbook.
</p>
<p>1.5E. Accompanying material
</p>
<p>One aspect of AACR2 1.5 that is not dependent on the physical format of the item,
however, is the treatment of accompanying material. The cataloger is given four
choices. He or she may (a) make a separate entry for the accompanying material;
(b) analyze it using multilevel description (AACR2 13.6); (c) simply mention the
material in a note; or (d) give details about the accompanying material as the final
element of the physical description area.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress and the National Library of Canada have issued
fairly detailed instructions to their catalogers for choosing between these four,
which should be of use to catalogers at other institutions as well.
</p>
<p>Option (a), separate entry, will be chosen if the material is not issued at the
same time as the main work or has a significantly different title or statement of
responsibility from that of the main work.
</p>
<p>Option (b) will never be chosen by either of these libraries.
If the item is of little bibliographic importance, or its title is not generic
</p>
<p>enough for option (d), or it is a supplement usable only in connection with the
main work, choose option (c).
</p>
<p>Option (d) may be chosen if the accompanying item satisfies all of the fol-
lowing: (1) it is issued at the same time by the same publisher as the main work
and is of use only in conjunction with the main work; (2) it is by the same author
as the main work or makes no mention of an author; and (3) its title is generic
(e.g., &ldquo;teacher&rsquo;s manual&rdquo; or &ldquo;plates&rdquo;) or lacks a title (or bears the same title as the
main work) (LCRI 1.5E1, Aug. 14, 1990; NLCRI 1.5E1).
</p>
<p>For an example of option (d), see figure 1-90.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>GE N E R A L RU L E S F O R DE S C R I P T I O N 71
</p>
<p>The example shown in figure 1-91 is a straightforward monograph that in
itself offers no problems to the cataloger.
</p>
<p>The publisher has also issued a &ldquo;Teacher&rsquo;s resource book&rdquo; to supplement the
main volume (see figure 1-92). Because the supplement has a different title and
different author from the main volume, it may be given a separate catalog entry,
option (a) of 1.5E1. (See also AACR2 21.28B for instructions for access points in
this situation.)
</p>
<p>If the supplement title were entirely different from that of the main work, the
description of the supplement would present no problem. But if the title proper
of the supplement consists of the title of the main volume and title of supplement,
or if the two titles are grammatically independent of each other, the cataloger

<p>follows a special procedure. Record the title and statement of responsibility of the
main volume first. Close this part of the entry with a full stop. Do not separate
title and statement of responsibility of the main volume with space - slash - space,
because this is not a catalog entry for the main volume. The supplement&rsquo;s title is
transcribed following main volume information.
</p>
<p>The cataloger must disregard the order in which the foregoing elements are
presented in the chief source of information (the title page of the supplement). The
order must be: Main volume information. Supplement title (see AACR2 1.1B9).
</p>
<p>The AACR2 title proper consists of everything before the space - slash - space,
although the specific title of the supplement is coded under MARC in subfield &Dagger;p,
as in figure 1-92. See also the final example in AACR2 2.1B1.
</p>
<p>1.6. SERIES AREA
</p>
<p>The series area is recorded in the 440 or 490 MARC fields. A series associated with
an item is one of the headings that requires authority work; that is, because the
series title appears in many items, the library must &ldquo;establish&rdquo; the form of the
series title that will always be used to trace the series (a series may appear in
slightly different forms in differing items and still be considered the same series).
The library will also want to record the treatment it wishes to apply to a series:
will it be traced or untraced? Will every item in a series be analyzed (cataloged
separately)? Will all the items be classed at the same call number or not? These
decisions are recorded in the authority record for the series, which will be kept in

</p>
<p>the library&rsquo;s authority file and must be consulted each time a new item in the
series is cataloged to determine its proper form and treatment.7
</p>
<p>In the MARC record, the 4XX fields are used to record the series as it appears
in the prescribed source in the item at hand. If this presentation matches the form
found in the authority record for the series (except capitalization and punctua-
tion), the series title is recorded in the 440 field (see figure 1-93). The first indica-
tor is blank; the second gives the number of nonfiling characters (see discussion
at 1.1A2). The 440 field &ldquo;traces&rdquo; (i.e., it is an access point in the record that may
be looked up by the user of the catalog).
</p>
<p>If the presentation of the series in the item does not match the form found in
the authority record, or if the library has chosen not to trace the series (this infor-
mation will also be found in the authority record), the form of the series title
found in the item is recorded in the 490 field, which does not trace. If the library
does not trace the series, the first indicator is coded &ldquo;0&rdquo; (see figure 1-94). If the
library does trace the series, but differently from the form found in the prescribed
source, the first indicator of the 490 field is &ldquo;1&rdquo; and the authorized form of the
series is recorded in an 8XX field, which traces (see, e.g., figures 1-56 [series traced
differently], 1-95 [series qualified to distinguish it from another of the same
name], and 1-55 [series traced under the author&rsquo;s name]). 4XX fields are not closed

cataloger, because these are supplied by the system. 8XX fields, on the other hand,
should be closed with a period unless a closing parenthesis is present.

<p>As it appears in the work being cataloged, the series statement typically
includes several different elements. Primary, of course, is the series title and the
volume numbering, if any, of the series. This information will be transcribed.
Names of editors may also appear with the series title in the work. These are not

field, following the same rules that govern transcription of the title of the work
(AACR2 1.1B).
</p>
<p>1.6B2. Sometimes the series title appears in more than one form in the publi-
cation. If differing forms of the series title appear, the cataloger is to &ldquo;choose the
title given in the first of the prescribed sources for the series area.&rdquo; This means,
for a book (see AACR2 2.0B2), that the cataloger will prefer the series title page,

<p>lists the series as &ldquo;Peanuts Parade 16.&rdquo; The book&rsquo;s cover calls it &ldquo;A Peanuts Parade
Book.&rdquo; Facing the title page is a page headed &ldquo;Peanuts Parade Paperbacks&rdquo; that
gives, in addition to the series title, a list of titles of books in the series with their
numbering. According to the definition, this page constitutes the series title page
and will be chosen for transcription in the series area (here, the 490 field) of the
catalog entry. Note, however, that a different form of the series title has been
chosen in this case as the authorized form (probably because of differing presen-
tations among the various items in the series); the series is therefore traced via the
830 field.
</p>
<p>1.6D. Other title information of series
</p>
<p>Include other title information only if it significantly helps identify the series. This
is very rare. If other title information is included in the series statement, it is sep-
arated from the title proper by space - colon - space, as explicitly shown in
AACR2 1.6D1. Unlike the 245 field, there is no subfield coding for other title infor-
mation in a series field (see figure 1-93 for an example of a series statement that
includes other title information).
</p>
<p>1.6E. Statements of responsibility relating to series
</p>
<p>If, as sometimes happens, all of the parts of a series are by the same author, a
statement of responsibility may be included as part of the series area if it appears
in conjunction with the title and if in the judgment of the cataloger it is consid-
ered necessary for the identification of the series (see figure 1-40). Sometimes, as
with a statement of responsibility for a work, the statement of responsibility is
joined grammatically to the title proper. If this is the case, transcribe it as it
appears (see figure 1-55).
</p>
<p>In the example shown in figure 1-96, the name of the responsible body is part
of the series title, although in this case the name has been abbreviated in the pre-
scribed source to an acronym. This acronym is regarded as an integral part of the
series title and is so transcribed.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the name of the entity responsible for the series has no grammat-
ical connection with the series title, but appears in relatively close proximity to it.
If in such a case the name is considered necessary for the identification of the title,
the statement of responsibility will be given according to the general rules for
transcription of the title and statement of responsibility area (see AACR2 1.1F).
However, no subfield coding follows the slash. As a series title is never estab-
lished with such a statement of responsibility, a series title transcribed with a
statement of responsibility will always be recorded in a 490 field. If the library
traces the series, the authorized form will be recorded in an 8XX field.
</p>
<p>The first of the two series in the example given in figure 1-97 includes a
formal statement of responsibility. The second series also includes the name of the
responsible body, but in this case the statement of responsibility is included as
part of the title proper of the series. Caution: in no case will the cataloger tran-
scribe the name of the series editor as part of a series statement of responsibility
(see discussion under 1.6 and figure 1-93).

<p>1.6F. International Standard Serial Number (ISSN)
</p>
<p>A series is closely related to a serial, and some series are of such a nature that they
could be cataloged as a serial under the series title (see Handbook chapter 12 for
further discussion and explanation). Some items that show a series statement also
show an ISSN, a number often used to identify serials. This information will be
recorded in the 4XX field immediately after the series title and before the series
number, if any. The ISSN is preceded by a comma and subfield &Dagger;x. The letters
&ldquo;ISSN&rdquo; are not transcribed in the MARC record; they will be supplied by the
system (see figure 1-98 for an example of a series that includes an ISSN).

<p>1.6G. Series numbering
</p>
<p>If the series is numbered, the number is recorded in the series statement. It is sep-
arated from the series title by space - semicolon - space and is preceded by sub-
field &Dagger;v. The cataloger is to transcribe the number as an arabic numeral no matter
how it appears in the source (but see an important exception to this in AACR2
Appendix C.2B2).
</p>
<p>Include whatever descriptive term (volume, part, etc.) appears with the number,
using abbreviations from AACR2 Appendix B (see figure 1-95). In an important
change in the 2002 revision, Appendix B abbreviations are to be used for these
terms even if they are abbreviated in some other way in the source (see AACR2
B.5B). Previously, such terms were transcribed exactly as they appeared, without
modification to make them conform to Appendix B. This change mainly affects the
term &ldquo;volume,&rdquo; which formerly would have been transcribed &ldquo;vol.&rdquo; if so found in
the source, but will now always be transcribed &ldquo;v.&rdquo; in the 440 or 490 field.
</p>
<p>If the series number is listed on the item without a descriptive term, do not
make one up (for an example, see figure 1-97).
</p>
<p>1.6H. Subseries
</p>
<p>Sometimes a main series may have a number of subordinate parts. If so, the title
of the main series is given first, followed by its series numbering, if any. If the
main series is numbered, it is separated from the subseries by a full stop and sub-
field &Dagger;a and recorded in a 490 field. If it is not, it is normally traced in a 440 field,
with the subseries preceded by subfield &Dagger;p. If the main series is numbered, both
series and subseries must be recorded in 8XX fields if the library wishes to trace
them (see figure 1-97 for treatment of a subseries).
</p>
<p>1.6J. More than one series statement
</p>
<p>If a work is part of more than one independent series, each series is recorded in a
separate 4XX field. If it is possible to make such a distinction, give the more spe-
cific series first (see figure 1-97).
</p>
<p>1.7. NOTE AREA
</p>
<p>Information to be recorded in the first five areas of the catalog entry is, for the
most part, standardized in content and presentation. Notes amplify the formal
description given in previous areas, providing information that cannot be included
there. Some notes are regarded as indispensable; others are given at the discretion
of the cataloger, depending on the intrinsic importance of the work and the needs
of a particular library&rsquo;s users.
</p>
<p>Notes are recorded in 5XX fields in the MARC record. There are currently
nearly fifty separate types of note fields, and new fields are constantly being
added. Only the most common fields and their subfield coding will be discussed
in this book. See the latest edition of MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data for
details of other note fields.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>80 GE N E R A L RU L E S F O R DE S C R I P T I O N
</p>
<p>One of the basic premises of AACR2 cataloging is that the main entry and
each added entry (not subject entry) must be justified by some statement in the
descriptive portion of the record.8 If the information does not appear in the body
of the entry (the first five areas: title and statement of responsibility area through
physical description area), it must be given in the note area. For example, it is cus-
tomary to give an added entry to a corporate body that sponsors a conference, a
publication, or some other type of intellectual or artistic activity, as long as this
relationship is indicative of something more than financial responsibility. Such
information can be included in the body of the entry only if it is found in one of
the prescribed sources of information. In the example shown in figure 1-6 the
sponsorship information was found in the publisher&rsquo;s foreword, a source that
may not be used for the title and statement of responsibility area. Because the
sponsorship statement was needed to justify an added entry, it is given as a note.
</p>
<p>1.7A1. Punctuation. AACR2 gives the cataloger the option of either starting a
new paragraph for each note, or simply continuing the entry without paragraph-
ing, separating notes with a full stop - space - dash - space. It is nearly universal
practice, however, to start a new paragraph for each note. In MARC records, this
means that each note is recorded in a separate field (see, e.g., figure 1-99). Notes
always end with a full stop (.). This will be done even when a note closes with
parentheses or square brackets (LCRI 1.7A1, Feb. 1, 1989; NLCRI 1.7A1) (see
figure 1-9, etc.).
</p>
<p>1.7A3. Form of notes. Use of prescribed punctuation (space - colon - space;
space - slash - space; space - semicolon - space) in the notes area is limited to
actual cataloging data that include such punctuation. But space - dash - space (the
punctuation prescribed for use between cataloging areas) is not to be used in
notes citing cataloging data. If more than one area is included in a citation in a

<p>note, separate the two areas by a full stop and one space. The note in figure 1-100
shows proper punctuation.
</p>
<p>Words found in AACR2 Appendix B (Abbreviations) are abbreviated, except
in quoted notes. Numbers are given as arabic numerals, except when the number
begins the note, in which case it is spelled out as a word (AACR2 C.4A; see note
3 in figure 1-13 for an example).
</p>
<p>Statements in notes should be as concise and brief as is consistent with clarity.
A quotation from the item itself or from another source may be given if it is
concise. If a quotation is used, enclose it in quotation marks and cite the source,
unless the information is found on the chief source of information. For such a
quoted note, with its citation, see figure 1-84. For an example of a note using
abbreviation, see figure 1-81.
</p>
<p>1.7A4. A note that shows the relationship of the work being cataloged to
another work is generally recorded as a formal note in a 500 field. Such a note is
prefaced by a brief, standard explanatory word or phrase followed by a colon and
the necessary information in standard cataloging format (except for the dash
between areas). There is no subfield coding. Figure 1-100 is an example. Note in
this figure that the place of publication and name of publisher are omitted. These
are only included if needed to distinguish between two versions published the
same year (LCRI 1.7A4, Feb. 1, 1989).

<p>Make a note giving the original title of a translated work unless the title has
already appeared in the title and statement of responsibility area. The original
title of a work that has been translated will be given, preceded by the words
&ldquo;Translation of:.&rdquo; Unless the names of the languages involved are a part of the
wording of the note, this is not a &ldquo;language&rdquo; note and thus is recorded in a 500,
not a 546, field (see below, at 1.7B2). The original title of a translated work is nor-
mally the uniform title of the work. If so, it is traced from the 240 or 130 field, as
in figures 1-9, 1-19, and 1-20.
</p>
<p>1.7B. Notes
</p>
<p>This rule gives guidance about various types of notes that may be included in the
note area. When more than one type of note is needed, give them in the order in
which AACR2 lists them, except when a particular note is very important.
</p>
<p>1.7B1. Nature, scope, or artistic form. If the nature, scope, or literary or artis-
tic form of the item is not apparent from the information in the formal part of the
catalog entry, and if the cataloger feels that such information would be useful, a
note may be given. Figures 1-3, 1-101, and 1-102 show typical notes dealing with
nature, scope, and form. This type of note is recorded in a 500 field.
</p>
<p>1.7B2. Language of the item and/or translation or adaptation. Give a note
about the language if the information is not evident from the catalog entry (see
figure 1-99). Language notes are recorded in the 546 field.
</p>
<p>This note is also used for adaptations (see AACR2 2.7B2). If it is not evident
from the formal part of the description, make a note in a 500 field to indicate that
the work is an adaptation from another work. A name-title added entry is made
for the related earlier work (see figure 1-103).

<p>1.7B4. Variations in title. The title must be taken from the chief source of
information; in a book, for instance, this is the title page. A variant title will some-
times appear elsewhere in the item, on the spine or cover of the book, for
example. Because some library users are likely to think of the item by its variant
title, a note should be made of the variant, if it is different enough from the title
recorded in the 245 field that it would file in a different place in the library
catalog. Significant variations in title within the item itself are traced from the 246
field. The indicators in this field may be used to generate notes automatically. If
the cataloger wishes the system to generate a note as well as trace the variant title,
the first indicator should be set to &ldquo;1.&rdquo; The second indicator generates various
types of notes. &ldquo;4&rdquo; generates the display &ldquo;Cover title: [title]&rdquo;; &ldquo;5&rdquo; generates &ldquo;Added
title page: [title]&rdquo;; &ldquo;6&rdquo; generates &ldquo;Caption title: [title]&rdquo;; &ldquo;7&rdquo; generates &ldquo;Running
title: [title]&rdquo;; &ldquo;8&rdquo; generates &ldquo;Spine title: [title].&rdquo; No 5XX note should be included in
addition to a correctly coded 246 field in the above cases. If the variant title falls
outside of these five cases, the cataloger may create whatever note is appropriate
by leaving the second indicator blank. The field then begins with subfield &Dagger;i,
which contains the wording of the note, then subfield &Dagger;a, which contains the
variant title. Subfield &Dagger;a traces. Because the 246 field does not contain provisions
for nonfiling characters, initial articles must be dropped. Do not end this field
with a full stop. (Detailed guidelines regarding the use of the 246 field may be
found in LCRI 21.30J, Feb.&ndash;May 2003.)
</p>
<p>Figure 1-67 is an example of the use of the 246 field. The title appears in a dif-
ferent form on the spine from that of the title page; if no provision is made for this
and the patron types in a search containing &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;and,&rdquo; he or she will
not find the item in many systems. Therefore, the cataloger adds a 246 field.
Because the indicators are coded &ldquo;18,&rdquo; the system will generate the note &ldquo;Spine
title: Forwarded &amp; finished.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In the example shown in figure 1-72, the title &ldquo;The Tale Is Told,&rdquo; a much more
memorable and distinctive title than the title-page title, is both on the spine and
the cover of the book. This is a more complex situation than provided for by any
of the 246 indicators; therefore, the cataloger will use subfield &Dagger;i. The note gener-

<p>ated will display exactly as the cataloger enters the information (without dis-
playing the subfield delimiters).
</p>
<p>Field 246 is also used for variant titles for which no note is necessary (e.g., for
alternative titles or parallel titles). In such cases, the first indicator is coded &ldquo;3&rdquo;;
this tells the system not to generate a note. The second indicator is &ldquo;0&rdquo; for por-
tions of the title (see figures 1-8 and 1-9), &ldquo;l&rdquo; for parallel titles (see figure 1-19), and
left blank for other variations that need tracing (see figure 1-102).
</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind that field 246 is for variations in the title proper and
is used to record both the variant and its source. If the source of the title proper
itself, as recorded in the 245 field, must be noted, it is recorded in a 500 field (see
discussion of 1.7B3).

recorded in a 500 field, and the original title is normally traced as a uniform title,
as in figure 1-22.
</p>
<p>For a related discussion of variant titles, including the use of the 740 field, see
this Handbook at 21.30J.
</p>
<p>1.7B5. Parallel titles and other title information. AACR2 1.1D4 directs the
cataloger to record parallel titles in a note if they are found outside the chief
source of information; likewise, 1.1E3 indicates that lengthy other title informa-
tion pertaining to the bibliographic history of the work may more appropriately
be included in the note area (see figures 1-26 and 1-72 for examples). These notes
are recorded in the 500 field.
</p>
<p>1.7B6. Statements of responsibility. If an added entry is to be made for
persons or bodies having responsibility for the item being cataloged and if this
information cannot, according to rules for the title and statement of responsibil-
ity area, be included in that area, a note will be made, generally in a 500 field,
giving the necessary information (see, for examples, figures 1-6 and 1-97).

<p>In the example shown in figure 1-105 information about the composer of the
music is found in the preface, which is not a prominent source. The information

<p>1.7B7. Edition and history. These notes serve to show the bibliographical
relationship of one item to another when it is not evident from the formal part of
the catalog entry. Such notes are of various types. For instance, when a revision is
entered under a different author, or when a revision has a changed title, give suf-
ficient information about the earlier edition so that it may be identified (see figure
1-100).
</p>
<p>A literary work that is continued by another work is given a sequel note (see
figure 1-106). A literary work that continues another story is given a slightly dif-
ferent note, an example of which is shown in figure 1-107. Unlike other types of

ing such information in the 500 field.

previous publication, revisions, etc.

<p>1.7B10. Physical description. Important information not brought out in the
title and statement of responsibility area that is of a type that, according to rule,
cannot be included in the physical description area should be given in a note in a
500 field. A note may also be given to amplify information that has been tran-
scribed in any of the preceding areas. Give a note, for instance, to record the pres-
ence of a map on the endpapers of a book, because such a map could be removed
from a copy of the book when it is rebound. If the map is duplicated on front and
back endpapers, as in the example shown in figure 1-110, say &ldquo;Map on lining
papers.&rdquo; If the maps are different, say &ldquo;Maps on lining papers.&rdquo;

<p>1.7B11. Accompanying material and supplements. Material accompanying
the work that cannot be described with a simple word or phrase should be listed
in a note in a 500 field rather than included at the end of the physical description
area (AACR2 1.5E). The second note in figure 1-112 is of this type. For other
methods of recording supplements and accompanying materials, see AACR2
1.5E, 1.9, and 13.6.
</p>
<p>1.7B12. Series. A series statement of such complexity that it requires expla-
nation may be given as a note rather than in the series area. This will be done only
rarely. A note about the series may also be given when cataloging a reprint if the
original work was part of a series (see AACR2 11.7B12 and figure 1-113).
</p>
<p>1.7B13. Dissertations. The fact that an item is a dissertation or thesis is
recorded in the 502 field. Use the word &ldquo;thesis&rdquo; to designate all types of academic
theses, dissertations, etc. Qualify this term with the degree (M.A., Ph. D., etc.), the
name of the university, and the date, as shown in figure 1-114. If these qualifica-
tions do not apply, the cataloger is to add &ldquo;Thesis (doctoral)&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thesis (master&rsquo;s),&rdquo;
as appropriate. This designation will most commonly be used when cataloging
European dissertations. A somewhat different note is used for a thesis revised for
publication (see figure 1-115). This note is recorded in a 500 field, not a 502 field.</p>

<p>1.7B14. Audience. If the information is stated in the item, a note in the 521
field about the intended audience may be given. In the example shown in figure
1-116, information regarding the earlier edition and the intended audience was
taken from the foreword. The 521 field with the first indicator blank will generate
in the local system the term &ldquo;Audience:&rdquo; at the beginning of the note. First indi-
cator &ldquo;0&rdquo; generates &ldquo;Reading grade level:&rdquo;; &ldquo;1&rdquo; generates &ldquo;Interest age level:&rdquo;; &ldquo;2&rdquo;
generates &ldquo;Interest grade level:&rdquo;; &ldquo;3&rdquo; generates &ldquo;Special audience characteris-
tics:&rdquo;; &ldquo;4&rdquo; generates &ldquo;Motivation/interest level:.&rdquo; If the first indicator is coded
&ldquo;8,&rdquo; no display constant will be generated. The note generated from the 521 field
of figure 1-116, because the first indicator is blank, will display to the public:
&ldquo;Audience: High school students.&rdquo;

<p>1.7B15. References to published descriptions. These notes are ordinarily
used in connection with the cataloging of early printed or rare books. A reference
to one of the detailed descriptions in one of the standard bibliographies of such
materials makes exact identification for these often complex bibliographical enti-
ties possible in a manner not possible for the cataloger following AACR2 (see
AACR2 2.12&ndash;2.18). Such notes are recorded in the 510 field. The title of the bibli-
ography or other source should be recorded as succinctly as possible followed by
the location (page or item number) of the citation. The first indicator should be
coded &ldquo;4&rdquo; and the page or citation number recorded in subfield &Dagger;c (see figure 1-117).
Guidance for abbreviation of the names of the most common sources will be
found in Standard Citation Forms for Published Bibliographies and Catalogs Used in
Rare Book Cataloging, 2nd ed. (Washington: Library of Congress, 1996). Unlike the
example given at AACR2 1.7B15, multiple citations are recorded in separate 510
fields in the MARC record.
</p>
<p>1.7B17. Summary. A brief summary may be included if it amplifies and clar-
ifies the catalog record. Summaries are particularly useful for entries for nonbook
materials as such items often are not easily accessible for browsing (see, for ex-
ample, figure 1-34). Summaries are also frequently included as part of the cataloging</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>GE N E R A L RU L E S F O R DE S C R I P T I O N 93
</p>
<p>of popular fiction and children&rsquo;s literature (see, for example, figure 1-109).
Summary notes are recorded in the 520 field. This field, with the first indicator
blank, automatically generates in the local system the term &ldquo;Summary:&rdquo; at the
beginning of the note. The note generated from the 520 field of figure 1-109 will
appear to the public: &ldquo;Summary: The adventures of Christopher Robin, Pooh
Bear, Piglet, and Eeyore, including the stories of the honey tree, the Heffalump,
and Eeyore&rsquo;s birthday.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>1.7B18. Contents. A contents note should be given when required by a spe-
cific rule, such as 1.1B10 (see figure 1-14). When the cataloger creates a biblio-
graphic record from a number of publications (a made-up collection), a contents
note should be made (see figure 1-118). Unless a collection (AACR2 21.7) contains
a large number of items (usually interpreted to mean more than twelve), a con-
tents note will be given (see figure 1-45).
</p>
<p>Give a list of the titles of individual works contained in an item. Add to these
titles statements of responsibility not included in the title and statement of
responsibility area. Individual items are separated by space - dash - space; if state-
ments of responsibility are included, they are separated from their titles by space
- slash - space. The contents note is recorded in field 505. If the cataloger is record-
ing the complete contents of the item, the first indicator will be coded &ldquo;0.&rdquo; If the
cataloger is unable to record the complete contents, for example because a multi-
volume set is not yet finished, the first indicator will be coded &ldquo;1&rdquo; (see figure 1-88).
Introductory terms or phrases such as &ldquo;Contents:&rdquo; should not be included, as
these are system generated. For detailed guidelines on LC policy for contents
notes, see LCRI 2.7B18 (May 2000).

<p>See also discussion under 2.7B18 in this Handbook for other types of contents
notes.

<p>1.7B19. Numbers borne by the item. Numbers such as the Superintendent of
Documents (SUDOC) number on U.S. government publications serve as impor-
tant means of identifying the item; in some libraries, government documents are
arranged by SUDOC number. Always list this number in a 500 field if it is avail-
able (see figure 1-73 for an example of a Canadian government publication).
Other items, such as technical reports, also show important numbers that must be
transcribed (see figure 1-119). Other miscellaneous numbers sometimes included
by commercial publishers are of no particular significance and can safely be
ignored.
</p>
<p>1.7B20. Copy being described and library&rsquo;s holdings. A &ldquo;local note&rdquo; records
matters unique to the library&rsquo;s copy. A 590 field is normally used (although any
appropriate 5XX field may be used if it contains subfield &Dagger;5 plus the library&rsquo;s
MARC library code).9 For example, the fact that the library&rsquo;s copy is autographed
is usually noted (see figure 1-55). The presence of a tipped-in errata slip should
also be noted, as such a slip may not be in all copies of the book (see figure 1-99).
If the library has a numbered copy of a limited edition, this may appropriately be
recorded in a local note (see figure 1-20). Other local notes would include a
description of the binding (particularly if it is in disrepair) or notation of missing
parts from the library&rsquo;s copy.
</p>
<p>1.7B21. &ldquo;With&rdquo; notes. The presence of an item that is physically inseparable
from the item being described is noted unless this has been brought out in the
formal description of the work. A note is made in a 590 field if the items were sep-
arately published and later bound together (see figure 1-120). If they were origi-
nally issued together as a unit, the note is made in a 501 field (see figure 1-56b).

<p>1.8. STANDARD NUMBER AND TERMS OF AVAILABILITY AREA
</p>
<p>The last area of the AACR2 catalog entry is standard number and terms of avail-
ability. Publishers began using International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)
about 1968; International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs) followed a year or so
later. Therefore, materials that appeared before 1968 will not have such numbers.
Because publishers include these numbers on a voluntary basis, not all materials
with publication dates after 1968 have them. If a book has a standard number, in
most instances the number will be found on the verso of the title page or on the
back cover. Record ISBN in the 020 field; record ISSN in the 022 field. Do not enter
the acronym &ldquo;ISBN&rdquo; or &ldquo;ISSN&rdquo;; for ISBN, do not record the standard hyphens.
These are all system generated. Do not close 020 or 022 fields with a period (see
figure 1-119).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.8D. Terms of availability
</p>
<p>LC does not record the terms of availability (i.e., price) of the item (see LCRI 1.8,
Feb. 1997). Do, however, add qualifiers such as &ldquo;pbk.&rdquo; or &ldquo;acid-free paper&rdquo; in
parentheses following the ISBN if they are succinct and are found in the item (see
figures 1-3 and 1-22). Qualifiers are particularly important to distinguish between
separate ISBNs for different manifestations (e.g., paperback and hardbound) of
the same edition (see figure 1-77). The National Library of Canada and the
National Library of Australia do record terms of availability in some cases for
&ldquo;current&rdquo; items (NLCRI 1.8D1, NLARI 1.8D). If given, terms of availability are
recorded in subfield &Dagger;c of the 020 field.
</p>
<p>1.9. SUPPLEMENTARY ITEMS
</p>
<p>This rule covers the description of such materials as separately issued continua-
tions, supplements, indexes, or other materials so closely related to another work
as to be more or less dependent on it. If in the cataloger&rsquo;s judgment the supple-
mentary material is important in its own right, the item may be cataloged as a
separate work (see AACR2 21.28). Supplementary material of lesser importance
may be cataloged as part of the entry for the larger work. Two methods of describ-
ing accompanying material have been discussed and illustrated already.
</p>
<p>1. The supplementary item may be added as accompanying material at the
end of the physical description area (see AACR2 1.5E and figure 1-111).
</p>
<p>2. If supplementary material is of minor importance but of such nature that
it cannot be listed succinctly in the physical description area, it may be
added as a note (see AACR2 1.7B11 and figure 1-112).
</p>
<p>A third method of describing supplementary items dependently is by using
multilevel description (13.6). By this method one or more parts of a multipart
work that has been cataloged as a unit may be brought out (i.e., &ldquo;analyzed&rdquo;). This
technique was developed for national bibliographies, for which some kind of sep-
arate entry must be prepared for each part of an ongoing work.
</p>
<p>1.10. ITEMS MADE UP OF SEVERAL TYPES OF MATERIAL
</p>
<p>Many library items are made up of several parts (e.g., an encyclopedia in twenty-
four volumes, or four sound recordings that form a unit). For cataloging, such
items are described as a unit; description of the parts is basically a simple enu-
meration of their physical extent.
</p>
<p>But in many instances library items clearly designed to function as a unit are
made up of components that belong to different types of material (e.g., a book
with an accompanying sound recording, or a plastic model of a cuneiform tablet
with a printed pamphlet of explanation).
</p>
<p>1.10B. If such a multimedia item has one predominant part, the cataloger will
make the catalog record from this part. Subsidiary parts will be added as accom-
panying materials, either at the end of the physical description area or as a note
(AACR2 1.5E and 1.7B11) (see figure 1-121).

</p>
<p>1.10C. Sometimes a package of different kinds of media, all of the compo-
nents of which are related and intended to be used together, has no predominant
component. Such a package is called a &ldquo;kit&rdquo; using North American terminology,
or &ldquo;multimedia&rdquo; by British GMD (see AACR2 Appendix D, s.v. &ldquo;kit&rdquo; and &ldquo;multi-
media item&rdquo;). A kit is commonly issued in a container with a title on it that will
serve as a collective title for the entire item. In most instances, use rule 1.10C2a for
describing kits (see figure 1-122).

<p>1.11. FACSIMILES, PHOTOCOPIES, AND OTHER REPRODUCTIONS
</p>
<p>Most libraries own many reprint editions of books, and libraries will increasingly
acquire them as reprint publishers and reprint editions proliferate. Therefore, it is
important that catalogers understand the provisions of this rule.
</p>
<p>Basically, the rule stipulates that the catalog entry must describe the item in
hand (i.e., the reprint). Any information pertaining to the original edition, even if
it appears in the chief source of information, will be omitted from the body of the
entry. Do not indicate such omission by ellipses. All necessary information about
the original edition will be given in a single note in the note area.
</p>
<p>Note, however, that LC and most North American libraries do not follow the
stipulations of 1.11 for &ldquo;reproductions of previously existing materials that are
made for preservation purposes&rdquo; (LCRI 1.11A, May 2000). This includes photo-
copies and reproductions published on demand (e.g., from University Microfilms
International in Ann Arbor, Michigan) and digital reformatting of previously exist-
ing materials. For such items the bibliographic data are transcribed as for the original
work; details relating to the reproduction are recorded in a 533 field (see figure 1-
123). The examples described below do not fall into this category, but are formally
published reprints. They exemplify the most common reprint publishing practices.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>98 GE N E R A L RU L E S F O R DE S C R I P T I O N
</p>
<p>In the most straightforward situation, the publisher creates a new title page
for the reprint, using its own imprint, sometimes rewording the title, and usually
also reprinting the original title page, as in figure 1-108. In this case the title and
statement of responsibility and publication areas are transcribed from the new
title page. The cataloger will ignore the original title page for most purposes,
although in this case the original makes it clear that the phrase &ldquo;the medallic
history of printing&rdquo; is an alternative title, so it will be given an added entry in the
246 field. A formal note pertaining to the original publication is recorded in a 500
or 534 field (see discussion at 1.7B7). For the form of this note, see AACR2 1.7A3
and 1.7B7. Another example of this situation may be seen in figure 1-124.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the original title page is reproduced as the title page of the reprint
edition, with the reprint publisher&rsquo;s imprint added to it. Such is the case with the
example shown in figure 1-125. In this example, &ldquo;1891&rdquo; at the bottom of the title
page is reproduced from the original. It should be ignored in the transcription
and given in a note (see AACR2 1.11C).

<p>Caution: give information in the note that corresponds to data found in the orig-
inal work in the format appropriate to the original work. The work cataloged in
figure 1-126 is a facsimile of an early printed monograph (book published before
1801). Cataloging data for the original would be transcribed according to AACR2
2.12&ndash;2.18 or Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Books (Washington, D.C.: Cataloging Distri-
bution Service, Library of Congress, 1991) (see discussion in chapter 2 at 2.12&ndash;2.18).
Publication area data as given in the 534 note of figure 1-126 follow 2.16D.
</p>
<p>In some cases a publisher will reprint an item giving little or no information
about the reprint itself. Nevertheless, here, too, the reprint information is recorded
in the publication area. In the case of figure 1-127 the name of the reprint pub-
lisher, the University of Notre Dame Press, appears only on the back cover. A new
preface has been added, which claims that this is a &ldquo;new, second edition&rdquo; (al-
though, in fact, no changes have been made) and states that the book has been out
of print &ldquo;for some three-score years.&rdquo; Given publishing practices of the period,
this book probably would have been in print until at least the mid-1930s; in addi-
tion, the book arrived as a new book in the library in 1995, sixty years later. The
cataloger is thus justified in estimating a publication date of 1995.

<p>The most difficult case is that of a publisher attempting to reproduce an orig-
inal in every detail. There may be nothing at all in the item identifying the pub-
lisher or the date of publication. In figure 1-128, the item has been scrupulously
reproduced, including a simulation of the original binding. The library&rsquo;s copy
came with a publisher&rsquo;s advertisement telling about the facsimile, but a copy of</p>

<p>this book could easily arrive in the collection without this small slip of paper. The
cataloger is still required to describe the facsimile, not the original, in the publi-
cation and physical description areas.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The term &ldquo;book&rdquo; is being stretched these days with the constant introduction of
new formats, but for purposes of AACR2 chapter 2, a useful definition is &ldquo;a non-
periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages, exclusive of the cover pages.&rdquo;1
A pamphlet, by this definition, has less than forty-nine pages;2 a printed sheet is
&ldquo;a single piece of paper . . . with . . . printed matter on one or both sides&rdquo; (AACR2
Appendix D [Glossary], s.v. &ldquo;sheet&rdquo;). The emphasis in chapter 2 is on text printed
on a physical medium such as paper.
</p>
<p>Librarians call the type of material included in AACR2 chapters 2&ndash;10 mono-
graphic. As opposed to a continuing resource (a serial or integrating resource), a
monograph is a &ldquo;bibliographic resource that is complete in one part or intended
to be completed within a finite number of parts&rdquo; (e.g., an encyclopedia issued in
parts) (see AACR2 Appendix D [Glossary], s.v. &ldquo;monograph&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>For the description of a printed work issued in microform reproduction, see
AACR2 chapter 11. For printed material issued as a continuing resource, see
AACR2 chapter 12 in addition to rules in AACR2 chapter 2.
</p>
<p>Most of the cataloging examples and discussion in Handbook chapter 1 are
purposely geared toward the cataloging of books, in order to provide a familiar
frame of reference to the inexperienced cataloger. Information already supplied in
Handbook chapter 1 is not repeated in detail in chapter 2, and most of the expla-
nations in chapter 2 are illustrated with figures from chapter 1. For this reason the
user of the Handbook is advised to begin with chapter 1 for details about mono-
graphic cataloging, and then proceed to chapter 2.3
</p>
<p>The cataloging of books will be governed by all appropriate rules in AACR2
chapter 1, &ldquo;General Rules for Description.&rdquo; Additional special rules that apply
only to books, pamphlets, and printed sheets, and not to other types of library
materials, are contained in AACR2 chapter 2.

AND PRINTED SHEETS</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.0B. Sources of information
</p>
<p>The title page is the chief source of information. If a book has no title page, the
cover, half-title page, caption, colophon, or running title may be used as a substi-
tute; preference should be given to the source with the most complete informa-
tion. Make a note if you have used a substitute for a title page (see figure 1-104).
</p>
<p>If title page information is spread over two facing pages without repetition, it
is transcribed as if it were found on one page (see figures 1-48 and 1-49).
</p>
<p>2.0H. Items with several title pages
</p>
<p>Sometimes a book has more than one title page. Follow guidelines under AACR2
1.0H. Prefer a title page giving a later publication date or, as with the example
shown in figure 2-1, prefer a title page with a publication date to one without a
publication date (1.0H1b). Engraved title pages are not treated in AACR2,
although they were common until the end of the nineteenth century. Following
customary cataloging practice, if a book has both an engraved and a printed title
page, the printed title page should be used as the chief source of information.
</p>
<p>A bilingual dictionary often has separate facing title pages in two languages.
Following guidelines under 1.0H1diii, choose the title page in order of languages
listed in the rule. If one of the title pages is in English, use it (see figure 2-2).
</p>
<p>2.1. TITLE AND STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY AREA
</p>
<p>See general discussions in this text under 1.1B and 1.1F1. The prescribed source of
information for transcription of the title and statement of responsibility area in a
book is the title page or, if the book lacks a title page, the title page substitute (cf.
2.0B1). In addition, statements of responsibility appearing &ldquo;prominently&rdquo; (AACR2
0.8, i.e., in the preliminaries and the colophon as well as the title page, all pre-
scribed sources for area 2, the edition area) may be recorded as part of the state-
ment of responsibility, if, in the cataloger&rsquo;s judgment, they are significant.
Statements of responsibility taken from &ldquo;prominent&rdquo; sources other than the title
page must be enclosed in square brackets. The title and statement of responsibil-
ity are recorded in the 245 field of the MARC record.
</p>
<p>2.1B. Title proper
</p>
<p>Transcribe the title proper in subfield &Dagger;a exactly as it appears in the chief source
of information. Generally, do not omit or add words. For general comments and
rules covering the recording of the title proper, as well as supporting examples,
see this Handbook at 1.1B.
</p>
<p>2.1C. Optional addition.  General material designation
</p>
<p>See discussion of general material designation (GMD) under 1.1C. If a library
chooses to add GMDs to materials covered by chapter 2, GMD &ldquo;text&rdquo; will be
added, in brackets, immediately after the title proper and following subfield &Dagger;h

<p>2.2. EDITION AREA
</p>
<p>The prescribed sources of information for this area are the title page, other pre-
liminaries (half-title page, verso of title page, any page preceding the title page,
cover), and colophon. Information taken from other sources must be bracketed.
</p>
<p>The edition area is recorded in the 250 field. Transcribe the edition statement
in subfield &Dagger;a exactly as it appears in the source. However, abbreviations from
AACR2 Appendix B should be used if available. See Handbook at 1.2 for discus-
sion and examples.
</p>
<p>2.2C. Statements of responsibility relating to the edition
</p>
<p>Record a statement of responsibility relating to an edition following space - slash

</p>
<p>If more than one edition statement is present on an item, record both, separated
by a comma. Capitalize the first word in each statement. See this Handbook at 1.2D
for discussion and examples.
</p>
<p>2.4. PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION, ETC., AREA
</p>
<p>The prescribed sources of information for the publication area of AACR2 chapter
2 materials are the title page, other preliminaries (half-title page, verso of title
page, any page preceding the title page, cover), and colophon. If information is
taken from a source other than these, it must be enclosed in brackets (see AACR2
2.0B2).
</p>
<p>This area is recorded in the 260 field of the MARC record. Prescribed order
and basic punctuation for information included in the publication area are as
follows:
</p>
<p>260 &Dagger;a Place : &Dagger;b Publisher, &Dagger;c date.
</p>
<p>All three elements must be given. See discussion and examples in this
Handbook at 1.4C6, 1.4D6, and 1.4F7 for procedure when one or more of these ele-
ments does not appear. For a general discussion and examples, see this Handbook

<p>at 1.4, 1.4C, 1.4D, and 1.4F. Abbreviations are used in the publication area if they
are found in AACR2 Appendix B.
</p>
<p>2.4C. Place of publication, distribution, etc.
</p>
<p>Record the place of publication in subfield &Dagger;a as it appears in the source. The cat-
aloger will always list the first place appearing in the prescribed source of infor-
mation. If this place is in the country of the cataloging agency (for catalogers in
the United States, a city in the U.S.A.), all subsequent places are ignored. If a city
in another country is given first, it will be recorded. But if a city in the country of
the cataloging agency is also named, it will be given in addition to the first city.
For a general discussion and examples, see Handbook at 1.4C.
</p>
<p>2.4D. Name of publisher, distributor, etc.
</p>
<p>Transcribe the name of the publisher, distributor, etc., following space - colon -
space in subfield &Dagger;b. The name may be shortened, but must remain identifiable.
See extensive discussion and examples under 1.4D in this Handbook.
</p>
<p>2.4E. Optional addition. Statement of function of publisher, 
distributor, etc.
</p>
<p>See Handbook at 1.4E for discussion of this statement.
</p>
<p>2.4F. Date of publication
</p>
<p>Transcribe the date found in the source, preceded by a comma, in subfield &Dagger;c. If
the date is given as a roman numeral, convert it to an arabic numeral. See
Handbook at 1.4F for discussion and examples.
</p>
<p>2.5. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AREA
</p>
<p>Chapter 2 gives special rules for describing books, pamphlets, and printed sheets.
The prescribed source for this area is the whole publication. The physical descrip-
tion area is recorded in the 300 field of the MARC record.
</p>
<p>2.5B. Number of volumes and/or pagination
</p>
<p>SINGLE VOLUMES
</p>
<p>2.5B1. Extent of the item. The extent is always the first element of the physical
description area and is introduced in the 300 field by subfield &Dagger;a. A single book is
described in terms of the number of its pages or leaves (see 2.5B2, etc.). Roman
numerals should be recorded as such, lowercase (see AACR2, Appendix C.2B3).
</p>
<p>Although books are the most common class of materials covered by AACR2
chapter 2, the chapter also covers other printed materials. Posters showing pre-
dominantly written material, handbills, and other separately published sheets

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>defined in AACR2 Appendix D as broadsides are also included in AACR2 chapter
2 (see figure 2-3), as are portfolios (two covers joined at the back holding loose
sheets). The number of pieces included in a portfolio (bracketed unless numbered
on the pieces) and the type of material may be designated (see figure 2-4).
</p>
<p>2.5B2. A broadside, a portfolio, or one or more loose sheets are described as
such in the physical description area. A single volume book is described in terms
of pages or leaves. Record the last numbered page or leaf of each section. A leaf is
a single sheet in a book. It consists of two pages, one on each side. If the leaf is
printed on both sides, the book is described in terms of pages (e.g., ix, 67 p.). The
pages of most modern trade books are numbered in this fashion. The cataloger
must be alert, however, for works printed or numbered only on one side of the
leaf. These are described in terms of leaves; that is, if we may speak of ordinary
books as being &ldquo;paged,&rdquo; these books are &ldquo;foliated&rdquo; (from Latin &ldquo;folium,&rdquo; leaf)
(see, for example, figure 1-104).
</p>
<p>2.5B3. Books published in the second half of the nineteenth century often
included a several-page list of other books issued by the publisher. The book illus-
trated in figure 2-1 has such a list on three unnumbered pages following page 460.
Such publishers&rsquo; advertisements are to be disregarded in the pagination of the
volume.
</p>
<p>2.5B5. The cataloger is directed in 2.5B2 to &ldquo;give the last numbered page, leaf,
or column in each sequence.&rdquo; 2.5B5 is a caution: a book whose pages are num-
bered i-xxx and then 1-500 is said to have two sequences; however, a book whose
pages are numbered i-xxx and then 31-500 has only one sequence, because the

<p>only change has been from roman to arabic numerals in the same sequence.
Hence, the pagination of the first book would be recorded xxx, 500 p., but the
second would simply be recorded 500 p.
</p>
<p>2.5B6. Sometimes a publication may be an extract from a larger work. Inclu-
sive paging is given for such a publication. In figure 2-5, the final two sequences
of numbers (519-542, 260-273) represent two articles by the author of the book
added as an appendix. Because their pagination is reproduced from the original
printing, it is so recorded.
</p>
<p>2.5B7. The Library of Congress has modified the provisions of this rule. Pages
or leaves of unpaged or unfoliated books will not be counted. Instead, the cata-
loger will use &ldquo;1 v. (unpaged)&rdquo; (see, for example, figure 1-30). For rare books,
however, the Library of Congress, and libraries that follow LC practice, will count
pages as before (what constitutes &ldquo;rare&rdquo; is, naturally, the decision of the cata-
loging agency) (LCRI 2.5B7, Feb. 4, 1991). This means that if such a work is neither
paged nor foliated, the pages or leaves should be counted and the number
recorded in brackets. Begin the count with the first page containing either print-
ing or illustration; end it with the last such page (see figure 2-6). Generally do not
count pages for items longer than 100 pages. For these, give the estimated number
preceded by &ldquo;ca.,&rdquo; without brackets.
</p>
<p>2.5B8. A volume with complicated paging. If there are various (i.e., more
than three) main numbered sections in a single volume monograph, record the
pagination as &ldquo;1 v. (various pagings)&rdquo; (LC will apply only method &ldquo;c&rdquo; of AACR2
2.5B8; see LCRI, Jan. 5, 1989) (see figure 2-7).

<p>plates are numbered by the printer (see figure 2-5). Do not count leaves or pages
of plates. If leaves or pages of plates are unnumbered, ignore them as part of the
first element of the physical description (LCRI 2.5B9, June 2002). When recording
numbered leaves or pages of plates, do not substitute arabic for roman numerals
when the publisher numbers the plates with roman numerals; but record roman
numerals lowercase, regardless of the publisher&rsquo;s practice (see AACR2, Appendix
C.2B1 and C.2B3).
</p>
<p>The type of paper used for printing has nothing to do with whether a leaf is
a plate or not. The important thing to watch for is that &ldquo;plate&rdquo; material must be
outside the regular numbering of the book. Plates are recorded either as &ldquo;leaves
of plates&rdquo; or &ldquo;pages of plates,&rdquo; depending on whether they are printed on both
sides of the leaf or only on one. However, to reiterate, if the enumeration by the
printer does not accurately reflect the number of pages or leaves of plates, or if
the plates are not numbered, the cataloger should ignore them. Unnumbered
plates are regarded simply as illustrations, to be recorded as part of the second
element of the physical description area (see AACR2 2.5C).
</p>
<p>In summary, a plate, by cataloger definition, does not form part of the origi-
nal physical makeup of the folded signature or gathering that makes up the book.
A plate interrupts the regular sequence of pagination of the book. Plates may be
gathered together in one place in the book, or they may be scattered through the
book. The number of plates, if recorded, must be recorded following the number
of pages, as part of the physical extent (first) element of the physical description
area. Give the number of leaves or pages of plates after the paging only if the
leaves or pages of plates are numbered by the printer. Do not count leaves or
pages of plates. If leaves or pages of plates are unnumbered, ignore them as part
of the first element of the physical description.
</p>
<p>2.5B10. Folded leaves. For an example, see figure 1-69.
</p>
<p>PUBLICATIONS IN MORE THAN ONE VOLUME
</p>
<p>2.5B16. Generally speaking, if a monograph consists of more than one physical
volume, record the number of volumes (e.g., 3 v.). If a multivolume set is incom-
plete, give the specific material designation alone without a number. Alternately,
following Library of Congress practice, catalogers may record the volumes of
incomplete sets within angle brackets (e.g., &ldquo;v. &lt;1-3&gt;&rdquo;) (see LCRI 2.5B16, June
2002, with LCRI 1.0C, Nov. 2003, and figure 1-88).
</p>
<p>2.5B17. See the definition of &ldquo;volume&rdquo; in AACR2 Appendix D (Glossary). If
the term &ldquo;volume&rdquo; is not appropriate for a multipart monograph, one of the terms
listed under 2.5B17 may be used. This is an inclusive list. Do not use terms other
than these in describing multipart monographs.
</p>
<p>2.5B18 and 2.5B19. The item on which figure 2-9 is based is paged continu-
ously, beginning with volume 1 and ending with the last page of volume 6. The
set is in six bibliographical volumes, bound in three physical volumes.
</p>
<p>2.5B22. Braille or other tactile systems. Because most North American
libraries follow LC practice and do not use the GMD &ldquo;braille&rdquo; (see AACR2 1.1C1
and its LCRI), the major clue in the catalog record that the material described is
for the visually handicapped is found in the record&rsquo;s physical description area. In
the first element of the physical description, the cataloger will add &ldquo;of braille&rdquo; or
</p>
<p>114 BO O K S ,  PA M P H L E T S ,  A N D PR I N T E D SH E E T S</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a similar term as appropriate to the statement of pages, leaves, or volumes (see
figure 2-10).
</p>
<p>2.5C. Illustrative matter
</p>
<p>This is the second element of the physical description area. It is separated from the
first element (number of volumes or pages of a book) by space - colon - space. In
the MARC record, subfield &Dagger;b follows the colon. The abbreviation &ldquo;ill.&rdquo; is used to
describe all types of illustrations unless one of the special types listed in AACR2
2.5C2 is considered to be important. The Library of Congress has ceased indicat-
ing particular types of illustration in most cases. If a book contains illustrations of
any type, including those listed under 2.5C2, the Library of Congress, and other
libraries following LC policy, will simply use &ldquo;ill.&rdquo; Maps, however, should also be
noted (LCRI 2.5C2, Nov. 1999) (see, e.g., figure 1-1). Note, however, that this
change does not affect the provisions of 2.5C3. Catalogers will continue to describe
a book in which all illustrations are colored as &ldquo;col. ill.&rdquo; or one that contains a mix
of colored and black-and-white illustrations as &ldquo;ill. (some col.)&rdquo; (see figure 2-6).
Examples in this text follow Library of Congress policy for illustrations.
</p>
<p>2.5D. Size
</p>
<p>Size is measured in centimeters, except for items measuring less than ten cen-
timeters, which are measured in millimeters. For a book, measure the height of
the cover. Fractions of a centimeter are rounded up to the next centimeter.

<p>Notice the absence in AACR2 chapter 2 of a rule numbered 2.7B8. The omis-
sion of this number is not accidental. As previously pointed out, the rules in
AACR2 chapters 2&ndash;12 are correlated with the general rules in AACR2 chapter 1
(e.g., 2.7B7 is a particular application for monographs of general principles gov-
erning edition and history notes set forth in 1.7B7). Rule 1.7B8 has to do with
notes pertaining to the &ldquo;material specific details&rdquo; area, a special area found only
in entries for cartographic materials, music, electronic resources, and continuing
resources. Because a monograph entry does not include the material specific
details area, this sort of note is not pertinent to monographs. Therefore the
number is skipped in AACR2 chapter 2.

</p>
<p>Informal contents notes are made when the publication includes features of
particular importance, such as indexes, that should be brought out. These are
recorded in a 500 field.
</p>
<p>Bibliographical citations are noted. AACR2 rule 2.7B18 includes examples of
such notes. The Library of Congress will not follow these examples (see LCRI
2.7B18, May 2000). Instead, if a publication contains bibliographical citations in
any form (including footnotes, etc.), use the following note in a 504 field:
</p>
<p>504 &Dagger;a Includes bibliographical references.
</p>
<p>However, if the publication contains a single bibliography, add pagination to
the note:

<p>AACR2 chapter 3 covers cartographic materials of all sorts. The most common
variety of cartographic material is a map, which is defined in the AACR2 glossary
as &ldquo;a representation, normally to scale and on a flat medium, of a selection of
material or abstract features on, or in relation to, the surface of the Earth or of
another celestial body.&rdquo; In addition, relief maps, globes, atlases, celestial charts,
and the photographs and surveys that are the raw materials from which conven-
tional maps are made are all regarded as cartographic materials and are also
covered by rules in AACR2 chapter 3 (see AACR2 3.0A1).
</p>
<p>Many nonspecialist catalogers in general libraries find the vocabulary and
techniques of cartography daunting. Such individuals will find much aid and
comfort in a manual issued by the Anglo-American Cataloguing Committee for
Cartographic Materials (AACCCM), edited by Elizabeth U. Mangan. Entitled
Cartographic Materials: A Manual of Interpretation for AACR2, 2002 Revision (2nd ed.,
Chicago: ALA, 2003), the manual consists of a rule-by-rule discussion and eluci-
dation of all AACR2 rules that apply to map cataloging. In addition, helpful
appendixes discuss such mysteries as determination of the scale and coordinates
of a map, the date of situation, and treatment of map series. There are also sec-
tions on early cartographic materials and electronic resources. Many examples of
map cataloging are provided by the national libraries making up the membership
of the AACCCM. The manual forms an invaluable companion to AACR2 chapter
3, &ldquo;Cartographic Materials,&rdquo; and should be used along with materials presented
in this chapter.1
</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that none of the chapters in AACR2 Part I, including
chapter 3, says anything about main or added entries. These rules are to be found
in AACR2 Part II, chapter 21. Useful guidelines interpreting chapter 21, however,
are found in Cartographic Materials Appendix A.
</p>
<p>Specific mention of maps was made in the original version of AACR2 21.1A1,
which stated &ldquo;cartographers are the authors of their maps.&rdquo; This statement,

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>together with other specifically listed examples of personal authorship, has been
eliminated in AACR2, being subsumed under a more general statement now
found under 21.1A1. This definition does not eliminate all instances of a cartog-
rapher being regarded as the &ldquo;author&rdquo; of a map, but it does place the burden of
choice on the cataloger&rsquo;s judgment as to whether the cartographer is &ldquo;chiefly
responsible for the creation of the intellectual or artistic content&rdquo; of the item.
</p>
<p>In addition, when determining main entry for cartographic material, the cat-
aloger should consult AACR2 21.1B2f, the rule governing entry of a cartographic
work under the heading for a corporate body. This rule states that 21.1B2 applies
to &ldquo;cartographic materials emanating from a corporate body other than a body
that is merely responsible for their publication or distribution.&rdquo; Cartographic
Materials A.4 points out that such a body may be given main entry even if its
name is not printed prominently on an item. The cataloger needs to take into
account the publication history of the body.
</p>
<p>Official Anglo-American cataloging preference for entry under person or
body primarily responsible for the intellectual content of a work is of long stand-
ing, going back at least as far as Charles Ammi Cutter&rsquo;s Rules for a Dictionary
Catalogue, which states that &ldquo;the cartographer is the author of maps.&rdquo;2 Entry
under cartographer may have fit in nicely with the principle of authorship
responsibility, but it does not seem to have been a very helpful method of
arrangement for most library users and was long regarded as controversial by the
map cataloging community, most of whom preferred entry under area.3 The
average library user generally comes to the library with a request for a map of
Boston, or a literary map of Great Britain, or a map showing Arizona&rsquo;s weather
patterns&mdash;an area or area-subject approach rather than an author approach.
</p>
<p>In the early twentieth century, U.S. libraries controlled maps in a number of
different homemade, informal fashions, usually keeping them apart from the rest
of the library&rsquo;s collection. It was not until 1945 when Samuel W. Boggs and
Dorothy C. Lewis presented their monumental The Classification and Cataloging of
Maps and Atlases that anyone gave concentrated attention to the solution of the
problem of proper identification and collocation of maps in a general library
catalog. Boggs and Lewis discarded the concept of author entry for maps in favor
of an entry that was &ldquo;to present that information which the experienced map user
is entitled to find, taking into account the essential characteristics of maps (e.g.,
scale and map projection); and . . .  to make the map catalog cards conform to
present library practice. . . . This should make it possible to consolidate the map
catalog with the book catalog.&rdquo;4 Boggs and Lewis suggested that cataloging
should be based on a title unit entry consisting of title followed by author, edition
(if any), place, publisher, and date. Added entries to bring out geographic area
and date, or area, subject, and date, would be made as needed.
</p>
<p>Boggs and Lewis&rsquo;s work had a great impact on practical library cataloging of
maps; it had little impact on official catalog code makers. The ALA Cataloging
Rules for Author and Title Entries, published four years later, still prescribed entry
for maps under &ldquo;the name of the person or corporate body responsible for the
content of the map, as cartographer, editor, publisher, government bureau, society
or institution.&rdquo;5 But an almost apologetic footnote following the rule recognized
at least that such author entry presented problems for both cataloger and library
user. It stated, &ldquo;Small libraries may . . . find that an entry under subject (i.e., area
</p>
<p>CA RTO G R A P H I C MAT E R I A L S 121</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>mapped) is all that is necessary . . . and special collections may prefer a main entry
under area, a scheme for which is worked out in the Boggs and Lewis Manual.&rdquo;6
</p>
<p>Map librarians remained unhappy with the official cataloging rules. Not only
was entry under author thought illogical for maps, but also, because many map
titles tend to be vague, title entry was of little value. Bill M. Woods summarized
the problem and, agreeing with the final report of the Special Libraries
Association&rsquo;s Geography and Map Division Committee on Map Cataloging, con-
cluded that maps required their own cataloging rules, which should be based on
area-subject-date rather than the principle of authorship.7
</p>
<p>Presumably this suggestion was considered by the editors of the 1967 Anglo-
American Cataloging Rules. As it turned out, though, the editors were under pres-
sure to get AACR1 into print, and so the rules for nonbook materials, which made
up Part III, are, for the most part, a reprint of the Library of Congress&rsquo;s own rules
for handling these materials. AACR1 chapter 11, &ldquo;Maps, Atlases, etc.,&rdquo; entered
cartographic materials &ldquo;under the person or corporate body that is primarily
responsible for its informational content&rdquo; if this responsibility was explicit (210,
211A). If it was not explicit, main entry might be, in order of preference, under
&ldquo;the individual whose survey provided the basis for the cartography . . . the car-
tographer . . . the engraver . . . the corporate body . . . that prepared the maps,&rdquo; or,
as a last choice, the title of the map (211B).
</p>
<p>Map catalogers in the period following the appearance of AACR1 continued
to be unhappy with the official rules for entry. The Library of Congress, of course,
followed the official rules. However, their coverage of maps as reflected in the
National Union Catalog was not adequate to assure libraries of LC copy for maps
in local libraries. Many map librarians disregarded AACR1 rules and adopted
Boggs and Lewis&rsquo;s manual, the American Geographical Society&rsquo;s Cataloging and
Filing Rules for Maps and Atlases in the Society&rsquo;s Collections (New York: American
Geographical Society, 1969), or the simpler rules advocated by the Canadian
Library Association8 or the Association for Educational Communications and
Technology.9
</p>
<p>The appearance of AACR2 solved some of these problems. Fewer maps are
entered under corporate author and more entered under title as main entry than
was the case with previous cataloging codes. The addition of a new area preced-
ing the publication area, the mathematical data area (now called the mathemati-
cal and other material specific details area), gives emphasis to scale and projec-
tion by including this important information as a part of the formal catalog entry
rather than as a note. But the overriding concern of AACR2 with the principle of
authorship responsibility governing main entry for all types of library materials
continues to mandate main entry under cartographer or corporate body when
appropriate. In an era of shared cataloging and fully integrated catalogs that
include entries for all types of library materials, such entry would seem necessary,
and the map cataloging community appears to have accepted AACR2 rules of
entry. This has been eased by the advent of electronic catalog records, in which
the distinction between main and other access points, including subject access
points, has become less important. All-important access by area is now primarily
handled through subject access (not covered in this Handbook, but 6XX fields in
figures 3-1a&ndash;b and 3-2 show how such subject access points are formed and
coded).

<p>3.0B. Sources of information
</p>
<p>Bibliographical information on the face of maps has not been standardized as
thoroughly as it has been for books, where most of the bibliographic information
may usually be found on the title page or its verso. Therefore, cataloging infor-
mation may be taken from any part of the map, its container, or, for areas other
than the title and statement of responsibility, other accompanying materials.
Punctuation and arrangement of data follow the general pattern set forth in
AACR2 chapter 1; rules given there should be followed as applicable.

<p>3.0J. Description of whole or part
</p>
<p>Many maps are issued as a set, sometimes over a long period of time in many
parts, sometimes at one time. A library may decide to catalog each of the indi-
vidual maps that make up the set, or it may decide to catalog the set as a unit, pos-
sibly making a separate entry for one or more individual parts of the set if this
seems useful. The Geological Survey of Great Britain issues several sets of this
kind, of considerable complexity (see the first example under AACR2 3.0J1).
Another example of a map set is that cataloged at figures 3-1a and 3-1b.10

<p>3.1B. Title proper
</p>
<p>Record the title proper for a map as instructed in AACR2 1.1B, following wording
and order exactly, but using AACR2 capitalization and punctuation rules.
</p>
<p>3.1B2. The title sometimes includes information about the scale of the map.
Although the scale statement is given formally as part of the mathematical and
other material specific details area, it will still be transcribed as part of the title
proper if appropriate (see figure 3-2).
</p>
<p>3.1B3. A map may bear more than one title. If this is the case, follow instruc-
tions under 1.1B8. Cartographic Materials 1B9 also gives useful help here, includ-
ing a diagram.
</p>
<p>3.1B4. Supplied title. See discussion under 3.1G5.
</p>
<p>3.1C. Optional addition. General material designation
</p>
<p>The general material designation &ldquo;cartographic material&rdquo; in brackets may be
added immediately following the title proper in subfield &Dagger;h, if the library chooses.
Following Library of Congress practice, examples in this text do not show GMDs
for cartographic materials unless they are also electronic resources.
</p>
<p>3.1D. Parallel titles
</p>
<p>A parallel title will be recorded as instructed in 1.1D (see figure 3-3). The order of
the titles is governed by the layout of the map; record titles from top to bottom,
or left to right, as given on the chief source.
</p>
<p>3.1E. Other title information
</p>
<p>Other title information will be recorded following general rules 1.1E (see figure 3-4).
3.1E2. Because the most prominent unit of the catalog record for many maps
</p>
<p>will be the title, add the geographic area covered by the map as bracketed other title
information, if the title gives no indication of the geographic area (see figure 3-5).
</p>
<p>3.1F. Statements of responsibility
</p>
<p>The statement of responsibility, as indicated in 1.1F, includes names of all persons
or corporate bodies that have some responsibility other than for simple publica-
tion or distribution of the item, as long as these names appear &ldquo;prominently&rdquo; (i.e.,
in the chief source of information or accompanying printed material, the pre-
scribed sources for areas 1 and 2 of cartographic materials) (see figure 3-6; see also
discussion in this text under 1.1F1). Cartographic Materials 1F1 gives a useful list
of terms that may introduce statements of responsibility on maps and other car-
tographic materials.
</p>
<p>Refer to discussion of figures 1-30 and 1-50 in this Handbook at 1.1F and 1.1F14
for the rationale for omission of names of Doyle and Grosvenor from the catalog
entry in figure 3-6.

<p>3.1G. Items without a collective title
</p>
<p>An item lacking a collective title may be described in several different ways.
3.1G2. Such an item may be described as a unit, following directions in 3.1G1.
</p>
<p>The example shown in figure 3-7a has been cataloged in this way. This item has
two maps, one on each side of a sheet. When folded, the side that shows is titled
&ldquo;The Earth&rsquo;s Fractured Surface.&rdquo; On this side of the sheet is a map of the world
showing fault lines; on the other side is a map of the West Coast of the United
States, titled &ldquo;Living on the Edge.&rdquo; The folding, in conjunction with the position
of the map of the world, makes &ldquo;The Earth&rsquo;s Fractured Surface&rdquo; the predominant
part of the item. Thus, the entry begins with this map.</p>

<p>3.1G5. If a set lacking a collective title is to be kept together and cataloged as
a unit, and if it consists of a large number of items (more than three), the cataloger
may supply a collective title descriptive of the entire set. According to instructions
in AACR2 3.1B4, the title must include the name of the area covered.
</p>
<p>The example shown in figure 3-1b illustrates cataloging for the set from
which figure 3-1a was taken. The collective title was taken from descriptive
information about the set from the issuing body. Because it was not found on the
chief source, it is enclosed in brackets. Each of the five maps in the set has an iden-
tical statement of responsibility and series statement (including series number).
Each map is titled separately.

<p>If a cartographic item includes an edition statement, it will be transcribed accord-
ing to general directions given in AACR2 1.2.

give the statement that matches the language of the title proper. Figure 3-3
includes such a statement. The title proper on this map is in Afrikaans; therefore

<p>3.2D. Statement relating to a named revision of an edition

The edition statement should be transcribed following provisions of AACR2 1.2D.
</p>
<p>3.3. MATHEMATICAL AND OTHER MATERIAL SPECIFIC DETAILS AREA
</p>
<p>The mathematical and other material specific details area is used only with carto-
graphic materials. Such essentials as scale, projection, and coordinates are to be
included in this area.11 This area is recorded in the 255 field.
</p>
<p>Information from map</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.3B. Statement of scale
</p>
<p>The first element of this area is the statement of scale. It is recorded in subfield &Dagger;a
of field 255.
</p>
<p>3.3B1. No matter how the statement may be given in the item, scale is expressed
in the mathematical data area as a representative fraction with a ratio 1 : x (e.g., 
1 : 250 means that one inch on the map represents 250 inches on the surface being
mapped). Note that even if the scale has been recorded as part of the title proper,
it will be repeated&mdash;translated into the proper representative fraction if neces-
sary&mdash;in the mathematical data area (see figure 3-2).
</p>
<p>If only a verbal scale is given, translate this into a representative fraction.
Enclose the figure in square brackets (see figure 3-9). A useful figure to know for
this translation is that one mile equals 63,360 inches. The bracketed scale state-
ment given with the second paragraph of 3.3B1 was calculated by multiplying
63,360 by 4. Similarly, 7,096,320, in the scale statement of figure 3-9, is 112 multi-
plied by 63,360.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, as in the map cataloged in figure 3-5, a map includes a bar graph
rather than a scale statement. Scale can be arrived at by using a scale indicator

<p>(a device for measuring bar graphs and grids to convert them into a representative
fraction) or a conversion formula. If no grid, bar graph, or verbal statement is found
on a map, compare the map to another of known scale and give an approximate
scale. Scale statements computed from a bar scale or grid, or estimated by compar-
ison with another map of known scale, should be bracketed and preceded by &ldquo;ca.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Useful instructions for the conversion of map scales to representative frac-
tions are found in Cartographic Materials Appendix B.
</p>
<p>A numeric statement of scale is not given for electronic resources unless such
a statement has already been recorded in the title proper or other title informa-
tion. This will occur only rarely. In the more usual situation, use &ldquo;Scale not given&rdquo;
in this area (see figure 3-4). This sensible rule recognizes the fact that the actual
scale displayed for electronic cartographic resources is dependent on unpre-
dictable factors such as screen resolution, projection settings, etc., and can often
be varied or manipulated.
</p>
<p>3.3B2. Optional addition. If it seems appropriate, the fractional scale statement
may be followed by additional scale information found on the item. If the cata-
loger chooses to do this, each element is separated by a full stop. For an example,
see figure 3-6. The Library of Congress will apply this option.
</p>
<p>3.3B3. Sometimes the scale used on a single item varies, especially on small-
scale maps (those covering large areas). If this is the case, give the largest fraction
followed by the smallest fraction, connecting the two by a hyphen (see figure 
3-10). Note here, by the way, that English-language terms are always used in the
mathematical data area.

<p>3.3B4. If the main maps are drawn to more than one scale, use the statement
&ldquo;Scales differ.&rdquo; Optionally, (a) if the projection and/or coordinates also differ, give
more than one scale statement in separate 255 fields (see figure 3-7a); or, (b) if the
projections and/or coordinates are the same for the main items, combine the scales
into one scale statement (see figure 3-1b). The Library of Congress will apply the
options only if there are no more than two scales (LCRI 3.3B4, June 2002).
</p>
<p>3.3B5. For some cartographic items, scale would be inappropriate. Such items
include imaginary maps. Often a pictorial &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s-eye view&rdquo; of an area is not
drawn to an accurate scale. If no scale is stated on such an item, do not try to
approximate one. Use the statement &ldquo;Not drawn to scale&rdquo; (see figure 3-11).
</p>
<p>Some maps, particularly those designed for tourists, are deliberately not drawn
to scale, in order that certain areas or features may be highlighted. The same state-
ment, &ldquo;Not drawn to scale,&rdquo; is appropriate for such items (see figure 3-12).</p>

(or its container, etc.), but it is known, it may be given in square brackets (see

<p>that they have nothing physical to describe. This unfortunately applies to remote
access electronic cartographic materials, even though the physical description
area for cartographic materials contains much useful information about the
content of the item. Partially as a result of objections by the cartographic commu-
nity, it is expected that the footnote to 9.5 will be deleted in the 2004 update to

<p>3.5B3. Atlases. An atlas shares the characteristics of both book and carto-
graphic material. The source of information for an atlas is, as for a book, the title
page (3.0B1; cf. 2.0B). In most cases, scale statement will be given according to
3.3B3. A statement of extent similar to that for a book is added within parenthe-
ses following &ldquo;1 atlas&rdquo; (see figure 3-14).

<p>3.5C. Other physical details

<p>The 2002 revision nearly doubled the number of details that may be recorded in
this area, adding layout, production method, and medium. Details are to be
recorded in the order set out in the rule.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The presence of color in a cartographic item remains one of the most common
&ldquo;other physical details,&rdquo; and is noted with the abbreviation &ldquo;col.&rdquo; in subfield &Dagger;b.
Other special features that should be recorded here if applicable include the mate-
rial on which a map has been printed if other than paper, and mounting, if the
map has been mounted. For atlases (3.5C4) the number of maps will be specified
if the maps are numbered or if they are listed in such a way that the number can
easily be ascertained (cf. 2.5C4).
</p>
<p>3.5D. Dimensions
</p>
<p>For maps, give, in subfield &Dagger;c, height by width in centimeters, measuring between
the neat lines (the innermost of a series of lines that frame the map). If a map lacks
such lines, or if it is extremely irregularly shaped, give dimensions of the sheet
(see figure 3-5). (Note: 3.5D1 stipulates that the map itself should be measured in
such a case, if this is feasible.) For a map designed to be folded, include the
dimensions of the folded map as well as the dimensions of the sheet (see figure 
3-2, etc.). Useful guidelines for measuring, with numerous illustrations, are given
in Cartographic Materials 5D1.
</p>
<p>3.5D2. Atlases. Measure atlases according to the rules for books (i.e., give the

<p>3.7. NOTE AREA
</p>
<p>Notes follow the general pattern stipulated in AACR2 1.7. In addition to directions
on the order of notes given in 1.7B, follow the order of notes indicated in 3.7B.
</p>
<p>3.7B1. Nature and scope. If the map contains any features not evident from
the rest of the description, which one would not expect to find in such an item,
make a note in the 500 field (see figure 3-13). Make a note of the method of
showing the relief on the map (see figure 3-15).
</p>
<p>3.7B11. Accompanying material. If material issued with a map and intended
to be used with it is too complex in its nature to be added at the end of the physi-
cal description area (see discussion in this text under 1.5E for criteria), in many
cases it may appropriately be added in the note area in a 500 field (see figure 3-16).

<p>One of the more problematic and controversial aspects of AACR2 is the cata-
loging of manuscripts, covered in chapter 4. AACR2 was not at first accepted by
archivists as a guide for their cataloging. In 1983 the first edition of Archives,
Personal Papers, and Manuscripts: A Cataloging Manual for Archival Repositories,
Historical Societies, and Manuscript Libraries (Washington, D.C.: Library of Con-
gress) was published in an attempt to adapt archival description to the standards
of AACR2. This was followed by a second edition in 1989, and this has become
the standard guide for archival cataloging.1 It will be referred to in the following
discussion as APPM.
</p>
<p>This chapter is not intended to present a detailed account of archival cata-
loging. This is a complex and specialized area, involving much more than simple
cataloging (papers and groups of records must be inventoried and organized
before cataloging can even be attempted), and librarians with large collections are
referred to the detailed discussion in APPM. Rather, this chapter is written with
the intent of helping a library that may have a few collections of letters or busi-
ness documents to make catalog records that will be helpful to its patrons.
</p>
<p>INDIVIDUAL MANUSCRIPTS
</p>
<p>In addition to archival cataloging (i.e., cataloging of collections of manuscript
materials), chapter 4 is also meant to cover the cataloging of individual manu-
scripts. Any unpublished item may be cataloged using AACR2 chapter 4. A thesis
is a common example of this type of material (see figures 1-114 [paper] and 1-123
[digitized copy]).
</p>
<p>Manuscript books (also known as codex manuscripts) are another type of
unpublished material that can be dealt with using AACR2 chapter 4. Figure 4-1 is
an example of AACR2 cataloging of a seventeenth-century manuscript.2 The title
has been transcribed from the title page exactly as a printed text would be (see
AACR2 chapter 2).

MANUSCRIPTS
(INCLUDING
MANUSCRIPT
COLLECTIONS)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AACR2 chapter 4 treats area 4, normally the publication area, differently from
treatment elsewhere because manuscripts are by nature unpublished materials. It
is called instead the date area, and contains only the date of the manuscript (see
4.4B1 and figures 1-114 and 1-123). If the place where the manuscript was written
is known, it may be recorded in a note (see figure 4-1).
</p>
<p>The physical description area for such a manuscript is similar to that of a
printed book (see 4.5B1). Begin with the extent of the item: in the case of figure 4-1,
the leaves have been paginated, so they are recorded as such. In a departure from
chapter 2 procedures, if the manuscript has been bound, indicate it with the rest
of the extent statement. In parentheses, record the number of columns if there are
more than one, and the average number of lines per page.
</p>
<p>If the manuscript is written on anything other than paper, record this in the
&ldquo;other physical details&rdquo; part of the area, along with the presence of illustrations.
The dimensions are calculated just as for a printed book: give the height to the
nearest centimeter up; include the width if it is less than half of or greater than the
height.
</p>
<p>Although AACR2 chapter 4 does make possible an adequate record for an
individual manuscript, catalogers of codex manuscripts, like archival catalogers,
do not find the chapter entirely satisfactory for the needs of their catalog users. To
meet this specialist need, a cataloging manual has been published, Descriptive
Cataloging of Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and Early-Modern Manuscripts
(AMREMM), prepared by Gregory A. Pass in collaboration with Electronic Access
to Medieval Manuscripts and the Bibliographic Standards Committee of the Rare
Books and Manuscripts Section of the Association of College and Research Librar-
ies (Chicago: Association of College and Research Libraries, 2003). Catalogers at
libraries with large numbers of this sort of manuscript should use AMREMM
instead of AACR2 chapter 4 to catalog them.
</p>
<p>ARCHIVAL CATALOGING
</p>
<p>It is in the cataloging of archival collections that AACR2 falls short and must be
supplemented by APPM. As outlined in APPM 0.8, archival cataloging is based
on three assumptions not common to other types of cataloging: (1) the provenance
of the materials is often the most significant aspect; (2) the materials exist in
groups rather than as single items; and (3) the materials are generally unpublished
and unique. These three considerations have some important effects on archival
interpretations of the rules.

<p>Archival collections may be accumulated &ldquo;organically&rdquo; (e.g., the records col-
lected by a business recording its activities) or &ldquo;artificially&rdquo; (e.g., materials gath-
ered by a collector around a particular subject area). In either case the link tying
the collection together is the creator of the collection. The importance of prove-
nance is reflected in archival rules for choice of access points, which may differ
from those prescribed under AACR2. Main entry is frequently under the creator
of the collection. Provenance also is reflected in a number of customary notes
used in archival cataloging and not used elsewhere, including historical notes
about the creator (APPM 0.9).
</p>
<p>Cataloging implications for the collective nature of archives include the fact
that the title will almost always be supplied by the cataloger. Detailed rules are
given for the formulation of this title. In addition the rules for physical descrip-
tion include description of aspects of the collection such as the amount of space
occupied by it as well as the number of individual items (APPM 0.10).
</p>
<p>The fact that archival materials are for the most part unpublished means that
AACR2 concepts of chief and prescribed sources of information are stretched to
the limit and become in some cases nearly meaningless. Also, given the lack of
imprint, publication, and distribution information, the entire publication area is
omitted from the catalog record (APPM 0.11).
</p>
<p>Among the aspects of AACR2 cataloging that initially caused controversy
among archivists were the rules for formulation of headings (AACR2 chapters
22&ndash;25). Because archival catalogs are now usually integrated with the overall
catalog of the library (which, unless it is solely an archival library, will include cat-
aloging of materials covered by other chapters in AACR2), it is imperative that all
contributors to the catalog, including archivists, follow the same rules for forming
headings and use established forms.
</p>
<p>APPM 1.0B (AACR2 4.0B). Sources of information
</p>
<p>The APPM chief sources of information for an archival collection are (in this
order): (a) the finding aid prepared for the materials; (b) provenance and acces-
sion records; and (c) the materials themselves. The sources listed in AACR2 (title
page, colophon, etc.) are geared toward individual items and are not useful guid-
ance for the cataloging of collections.
</p>
<p>APPM 1.1 (AACR2 4.1). 
TITLE AND STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY AREA
</p>
<p>If a manuscript has a formal title, use it. This will only be the case with individ-
ual manuscripts (see figure 4-1). In the case of collections and manuscripts
without a formal title, the cataloger must supply the title. In a departure from
AACR2 rules, because supplied titles will occur in nearly all of archival cata-
loging, a supplied title is not to be enclosed in square brackets.
</p>
<p>A title statement may be taken from a formally prepared inventory or finding
aid. More normally, however, the title will consist of generic terms characterizing
the form of the material. Use &ldquo;papers&rdquo; for the personal papers of a person or
persons (see figure 4-2; &ldquo;papers&rdquo; is also used in figure 4-3, which includes a

of figure 4-5, the name element is necessary to clarify the nature of the collection.
</p>
<p>A supplied title consisting of more than simply a generic term is recorded in
subfield &Dagger;a of the 245 field (see figure 4-5). If it consists only of generic form terms,
use subfield &Dagger;k (see figures 4-2, 4-4, etc.). Previous to 2003, 245 fields containing
generic or made-up titles would have been coded with first indicator &ldquo;0&rdquo; so that
they would not trace. The 2003 amendments to AACR2 included a change to
21.30J1 whereby all titles are traced (see discussion in this Handbook chapter 14, at
21.30J).  Henceforth, any title, including generic or made-up titles, should be
coded first indicator &ldquo;1,&rdquo; so long as there is a main entry in a 1XX field. If there is
no 1XX field (i.e., the title itself is the main entry), these titles will continue to be
coded first indicator &ldquo;0.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>If parallel titles, other title information, or statements of responsibility are
present, they may be added as outlined in this Handbook at 1.1D&ndash;F. This will occur
only rarely (cf. APPM 1.1D&ndash;F).

<p>An additional element in the APPM title area, not present in AACR2, is the
date element (APPM 1.1B5). This is the last element of the area. End the title/
statement of responsibility portion of the area with a comma; in subfield &Dagger;f,
record the inclusive dates of the materials (i.e., the years of the earliest and latest
items in the collection). In the case of a collection that is continuing to grow (as
with a current business archive), add &ldquo;[ongoing]&rdquo; in the place of the closing date
(e.g., &ldquo;1969-[ongoing]&rdquo;) (see figure 4-5). For other examples of the date element,
see figures throughout this chapter. If more specificity than years is possible,

<p>The general material designation (GMD) may be added to the titles of archival
cataloging in accordance with the library&rsquo;s policy. For example, an archival col-
lection consisting solely of electronic data might have the GMD &ldquo;electronic
resource.&rdquo; If used, the GMD should be added immediately after the title proper
in subfield &Dagger;h.
</p>
<p>APPM 1.2 (AACR2 4.2). EDITION AREA
</p>
<p>The edition area is used in archival cataloging only when describing individual
items, if the item is a different version of another item (e.g., various drafts of a lit-
erary author&rsquo;s manuscript). If the item includes an edition statement (e.g., &ldquo;3rd
draft&rdquo;), use it. AACR2 abbreviations should be used. If the item lacks an edition
statement but it is known that it includes significant changes from another
version, the cataloger should supply an edition statement, in the language of the
title proper, within brackets (e.g., &ldquo;[4th revision]&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>AACR2 4.4. DATE AREA
</p>
<p>This area is not used in archival cataloging, because the dates of the material have
already been included in the title area (cf. APPM 1.4).

<p>APPM 1.5 (AACR2 4.5). PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AREA
</p>
<p>APPM 1.5B (AACR2 4.5B). Statement of extent
</p>
<p>Give a statement in subfield &Dagger;a of the 300 field either in terms of number of items
(see figures 4-2 and 4-3), in terms of the number of linear or cubic feet (meters in
Canada) occupied (see figure 4-4), or both (see figure 4-5). With the latter option,
give the second part in parentheses. The parts can be given in either order (the
statement of extent of figure 4-5 could have been given &ldquo;3 linear ft. (7 boxes)&rdquo;).
Separate statements of extent may also be given if the collection consists of more
than one type of material (see figure 4-2). The elements included in the statement
of extent and their order are determined by the policy of the cataloging agency.
This policy should be &ldquo;internally consistent and clearly indicate to a potential
user the size of the collection&rdquo; (APPM 1.5B1).
</p>
<p>APPM 1.5C (AACR2 4.5C). Other physical details
</p>
<p>APPM instructs the cataloger to give &ldquo;any other physical details that the repository
considers important (e.g., the type of paper, the presence of illustrations or maps, or
the type of binding).&rdquo; This allows more latitude than the equivalent AACR2 rule,
which is similar to the rule for printed books (although it does allow naming the
material on which the item is written if it is other than paper; see 4.5C1).
</p>
<p>APPM 1.5D (AACR2 4.5D). Dimensions
</p>
<p>This element of the physical description area is optional under APPM. It is not
optional under AACR2. If used, give the size rounding up to the nearest cen-
timeter. In the case of a collection, if the sizes are not uniform, give the largest size
followed by &ldquo;or smaller&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;45 cm. or smaller&rdquo;). Dimensions have not been
given in examples in this Handbook.
</p>
<p>APPM 1.7 (AACR2 4.7). NOTE AREA
</p>
<p>APPM 1.7B1. Biographical/Historical (partially covered in AACR2 4.7B1). Make a
brief statement about the creator of the archival materials, including dates, if relevant.
This statement is recorded in a 545 field (see examples throughout this chapter).
</p>
<p>APPM 1.7B2. Scope and content/Abstract (AACR2 4.7B1, 4.7B17). Describe
the content, nature, and scope of the materials. The note is given in a 520 field (see
figures throughout this chapter).
</p>
<p>APPM 1.7B4. Additional physical form available. If the library has, in addi-
tion to the original materials, copies in another physical form (e.g., a microfilm),
make a note of it in a 530 field (see figure 4-7).
</p>
<p>APPM 1.7B9. Provenance; APPM 1.7B10. Immediate source of acquisition
(AACR2 4.7B7). Make a note detailing the custodial history of the materials; if
earlier custodial history is known in addition to the immediate source of acquisi-
tion, make two notes. A custodial history note is recorded in a 561 field; an imme-
diate source of acquisition note is recorded in a 541 field (see figures 4-6 and 4-7
for examples of a 1.7B10 immediate source of acquisition note and figure 4-7 for
a 1.7B9 provenance/custodial history note).

<p>case of a large collection, the researcher needs an index or finding aid (a detailed
description of the collection, giving information about each individual item) in
order to use the materials. If such an aid has been prepared, it should be noted in
a 555 note (see examples throughout this chapter). Many archives now publish
finding aids on the Internet. If a collection&rsquo;s aid has been so published, record it
in the 856 field, which contains the URL (see figure 4-8). Most catalog systems will

</p>
<p>CHOICE OF ACCESS POINTS
</p>
<p>APPM departs somewhat from AACR2 on rules for choice of access points, par-
ticularly in the determination of main entry. However, if the collection is consid-
ered as a whole and the person or body responsible for assembling the collection
(i.e., the intellectual content of the activity) is thought of as the author, archival
practice can make sense to a cataloger used to the philosophy underlying AACR2
on the question.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>APPM directs the cataloger to make entry under personal name if a collection
consists of the personal papers of an individual (APPM 2.1A1; see figures 4-2, 4-3,
and 4-6) or, in the case of an individual manuscript, if the item is of known
authorship (see figure 4-1).
</p>
<p>Family papers are to be entered under the family name (APPM 2.1A3).
Collections &ldquo;artificially accumulated around a person, subject, activity, etc.,
</p>
<p>without regard to the archival integrity or provenance of the materials&rdquo; are to be
entered under the name of the collector (APPM 2.1A4). In this case, add the
relator term &ldquo;collector&rdquo; in subfield &Dagger;e following the heading for the person (see
figure 4-5).
</p>
<p>Interviews of individuals are to be entered under the name of the interviewee,
with added entry for the interviewer(s) (APPM 2.1A6).
</p>
<p>The records of a corporate body are to be entered under the heading for that
body. Records &ldquo;consist of any documentation created in the course of fulfilling the
purposes and functions of the corporate body&rdquo; (APPM 2.1B2; see figure 4-4). This
is a much more inclusive rule than the restrictive rules for entry under corporate
body in AACR2 chapter 21.
</p>
<p>In contrast to AACR2 practice, if the corporate body&rsquo;s name changed during
the period covered by the collection, enter under the latest name covered and give
added entries for other names used during the period (APPM 2.1B3).
</p>
<p>The following should be entered under title: artificial collections better
known under the name of the collection than the name of the collector (APPM
2.1C2); the personal papers of more than one individual where no one person is
identified as predominating (APPM 2.1C3); collections emanating from corporate
bodies but not falling under the definition of &ldquo;records,&rdquo; above (APPM 2.1C4);
family papers of more than one family (APPM 2.1C5); and collections of unknown
origin or authorship (APPM 2.1C6).

<p>AACR2 chapter 5 covers the description of published music. Rules in chapter 5
do not deal with choice and form of main and added entries. These are covered
in AACR2 chapters 21 through 24. Nor does chapter 5 concern itself with rules for
uniform titles that are usually needed to organize entries for musical works.
These rules are contained in AACR2 chapter 25, particularly rules 25.25 through
25.35.
</p>
<p>This chapter of the Handbook will first discuss choice of access points for
music (AACR2 chapter 21); next, the bibliographic description of music (AACR2
chapter 5); and finally, the formulation of uniform titles (AACR2 chapter 25).1
</p>
<p>AACR2 Chapter 21. Choice of Access Points
</p>
<p>The cataloging of music, because of the special nature of the material, presents
unique problems. Indicative of these problems is the fact that a fairly substantial
section of AACR2 chapter 21 (rules 21.18&ndash;21.22) is given over to specific rules for
choice of entry for musical works. It must be emphasized, however, that the
general principles governing choice of main entry for other types of library mate-
rials apply equally to musical works. For instance, the composer of a musical
work is regarded as the author and, according to 21.1A1, will be given main entry
(see figure 5-1).
</p>
<p>21.18. MUSICAL WORKS: GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>This rule concerns itself with choice of entry for musical arrangements, free tran-
scriptions, and other arrangements that in some way are different from the com-
poser&rsquo;s original work.

<p>21.20. MUSICAL SETTINGS FOR BALLETS, ETC.
</p>
<p>Main entry for such works will be under the composer of the music; an added
entry will be given to a choreographer, etc., whose name appears in the chief
source of information. Martha Graham is the choreographer for the work on
which figure 5-7 is based.
</p>

</p>
<p>21.21. ADDED ACCOMPANIMENTS, ETC.
</p>
<p>If a composer takes a musical work of another and adds an instrumental accom-
paniment or parts, the newly created work is entered under the heading of the
original work. The composer of the accompaniment or additional parts is given
an added entry. In figure 5-8, Robert Maddox took the familiar tune &ldquo;Waltzing
Matilda,&rdquo; originally composed by Marie Cowan, and added additional parts for
flute choir. Cowan is given main entry; Maddox is given an added entry.
</p>
<p>Sometimes a composer writes only the basic structure of the music, leaving it
up to the performer to &ldquo;realize,&rdquo; or fill in the harmony, of a piece. This is particu-
larly common in music of the baroque period. A &ldquo;realization&rdquo; may be written
down and published. This is not considered an &ldquo;added accompaniment&rdquo; for cat-
aloging purposes. Such works fall instead under AACR2 21.18B, Arrangements,
transcriptions, etc.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AACR2 Chapter 5. Music
</p>
<p>AACR2 rules 21.18&ndash;21.22 are concerned with special problems of entry of musical
works. The rules in AACR2 chapter 5 deal with the description of such works.
</p>
<p>5.0B1. Chief source of information. As with printed books (AACR2 chapter
2), the chief source of information for a musical work is the title page. One type
of title page, a &ldquo;list&rdquo; title page, is simply a list of the composer&rsquo;s works issued by
the publisher or lists of related music from the publisher. Included in the list will
be the title of the work being cataloged. When dealing with a title page of this
type, the cataloger is directed to use either the &ldquo;list&rdquo; title page, a caption title page
(title on first page of musical text), or a cover title page, whichever provides the
fullest information. The list title page furnished the information for the example
shown in figure 5-9. Note the omission from the catalog entry of the other titles
listed on the page.

<p>5.1. TITLE AND STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY AREA
</p>
<p>5.1B. Title proper
</p>
<p>The chief source of information must be used in transcribing the title proper.
General rule 1.1B governs the transcription of titles of musical works. In addition,
because musical works are frequently issued in different editions with varying
titles, and because in many cases the titles of published works are not adequate
for a proper organization of a composer&rsquo;s file, the cataloger often interposes a
uniform title between the main entry heading and the title proper as it appears on
a single work. See discussion of AACR2 25.25&ndash;25.35 at the end of this chapter for
rules for uniform titles for musical works.
</p>
<p>5.1B1. Determination of the length of the title proper can be a problem in
music cataloging, because so many pieces of music are given titles consisting of a
generic term (the name of a type of composition, such as &ldquo;symphony&rdquo; or &ldquo;con-
certo&rdquo;) followed by a medium of performance (e.g., &ldquo;for flute&rdquo;), key (e.g., &ldquo;in B
flat&rdquo;), opus number (e.g., &ldquo;no. 3&rdquo;), etc. In such a case, all of this information is
included as part of the title proper (see figure 5-10). On the other hand, if the title
is not generic (e.g., &ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo;), or consists of a generic term modified by a
nongeneric adjective (e.g., &ldquo;The Pastoral Symphony&rdquo;), any mention of medium of
performance, key, etc., on the chief source will be treated as other title informa-
tion (see figure 5-11).
</p>
<p>5.1C. Optional addition. General material designation
</p>
<p>The cataloger may optionally add the general material designation (GMD) &ldquo;music&rdquo;
in brackets immediately following the title proper. Following Library of Congress
practice, examples of music in this text do not include GMDs.

<p>5.3. Optional area. MUSICAL PRESENTATION STATEMENT AREA
</p>
<p>This area is to be used to indicate the special format of a musical work when such
a work has appeared in more than one format and when the information regard-
ing the format appears on the chief source of information. Examples of such state-
ments would be &ldquo;Playing score,&rdquo; &ldquo;Study score,&rdquo; &ldquo;Miniature score,&rdquo; &ldquo;Parts,&rdquo; or
other statements referring to the physical presentation of the music. This is
recorded in field 254, subfield &Dagger;a (see figure 5-14). If the statement implies a
changed version from the original (&ldquo;vocal score,&rdquo; for example), or is associated
with a statement of responsibility, the information should be recorded as part of
the statement of responsibility rather than in the musical presentation statement
area. LC applies optional area 5.3.
</p>
<p>5.4. PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION, ETC., AREA
</p>
<p>General rule 1.4 is to be followed in transcribing this area. Note, however, that the
prescribed sources of information for the publication area for AACR2 chapter 5
include the first page of the music (see 5.0B2). It is common practice in music pub-
lishing to put a copyright date at the foot of the first page of the music, and this
is frequently the only date found in the publication (see figure 5-2).</p>

<p>5.7B18. Contents. Formulate contents notes as explained at 1.7B18 (see figures
5-1, 5-5, 5-6, etc.). If the record is for a single work, titles of individual movements
of the work may be given in the contents note &ldquo;if they provide useful informa-
tion&rdquo; (Library of Congress, Music Cataloging Decisions [hereinafter, MCD], 5.7B18).
</p>
<p>5.7B19. Publishers&rsquo; numbers and plate numbers. Plate numbers may appear
at the bottom of each page of music. The publisher&rsquo;s number is a number that
usually appears on the title page. These numbers may serve as a clue to the pub-
lication date of music that appears with no indication of this information. In addi-
tion, because they are often included in listings of music in publishers&rsquo; catalogs,
such numbers serve as a means of identification. If they are found, they should be
recorded in the 028 field, with the first indicator coded &ldquo;2&rdquo; for a plate number or
&ldquo;3&rdquo; for a publisher&rsquo;s number. If the second indicator is coded &ldquo;2,&rdquo; a note will be
generated with the display &ldquo;Pl. no.:&rdquo; or &ldquo;Publisher&rsquo;s no.:,&rdquo; as appropriate. The
number is recorded in subfield &Dagger;a; its source (usually the name of the publisher)
is recorded in subfield &Dagger;b (see figures 5-1, 5-7, etc.).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.8. STANDARD NUMBER AND TERMS OF AVAILABILITY AREA
</p>
<p>See discussion in Handbook at 1.8.
5.8B2. The cataloger is instructed to &ldquo;give any other number [than ISBN or
</p>
<p>ISSN] in a note.&rdquo; There is, however, a MARC field for the International Standard
Music Number (ISMN): the 024 field with the first indicator coded &ldquo;2.&rdquo; Thus
ISMNs should be recorded there rather than in a note field (see figure 5-12).
</p>
<p>AACR2 Chapter 25. Uniform Titles
</p>
<p>For a general discussion of uniform titles, see this Handbook, chapter 18. Discussed
here are specific rules for music uniform titles.
</p>
<p>Uniform titles in music serve the same purpose as uniform titles for other
types of materials. However, because of the special nature of music titling prac-
tice, uniform titles are particularly crucial to music cataloging, and the majority
of music catalog records will contain a uniform title. According to AACR2 25.1A,
a uniform title is used (1) to bring together in the catalog all entries for the same
work, even though they may have been published under differing titles; (2) to
identify a work that is known by a different title than that under which it was
published; (3) to differentiate between different works published under the same
title; and (4) to aid in the organization of the bibliographic file in a logical manner.
These are all important in music cataloging. Music is published and republished,
and often the same work is issued under many different titles; frequently, famous
works come to have a different name than that under which they are published
(for example, should the catalog user look for Beethoven&rsquo;s Third Symphony
under &ldquo;Symphony no. 3&rdquo; or &ldquo;Eroica&rdquo;?); and the differentiation function is extremely
important (a composer may write many pieces titled &ldquo;sonata&rdquo; or &ldquo;trio,&rdquo; and the
catalog user must be guided to the one he or she wants).
</p>
<p>25.25. MUSIC: GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>This rule simply directs the cataloger to use the special rules for music uniform
titles (25.26&ndash;25.35) rather than the more general rules in the rest of the chapter. As
with other uniform titles, music uniform titles are recorded in the 240 field if there
is an author main entry (a 1XX field) or in the 130 field if the work is entered
under title (in which case the uniform title becomes the main entry). If the 240
field is used, the first indicator is coded &ldquo;1&rdquo; if the cataloger wishes the uniform
title to display; if it is coded &ldquo;0&rdquo; it will not display. The second indicator gives the
number of nonfiling characters. For uniform titles formulated using AACR2, this
will always be &ldquo;0,&rdquo; because initial articles are dropped (see 25.2C). If the 130 field
is used to record the uniform title, the first indicator shows the number of nonfil-
ing characters, which again will always be &ldquo;0&rdquo; under AACR2. The second indica-
tor is blank.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress&rsquo;s catalogers do not add a uniform title to a catalog
record if it would be identical to the title proper (MCD 25.25, May 1989).
Obviously, however, the cataloger must still formulate a uniform title for every
</p>
<p>164 MU S I C</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>work in order to know whether it would be identical to the title proper, so it is
important to understand the following rules.
</p>
<p>25.26. GENERAL RULE (INDIVIDUAL TITLES)
</p>
<p>25.26 instructs the cataloger to &ldquo;formulate the initial title element&rdquo; and make
required additions. The concept of the initial title element is unique to music cat-
aloging and may be somewhat difficult to grasp. The initial title element is &ldquo;the
word or words selected from the title of a musical work and placed first in the
uniform title for that work&rdquo; (see AACR2 Appendix D [Glossary], s.v. &ldquo;Initial title
element&rdquo;). The complication is deciding which word or words to select from the
title to place in the uniform title. This will be discussed under 25.28&ndash;25.29.
</p>
<p>25.27. SELECTION OF TITLE
</p>
<p>Before attempting to formulate the initial title element, the cataloger must choose
the title to use as the basis of this initial title element. 25.27A instructs the cataloger
to choose the composer&rsquo;s original title in the language in which the work was pre-
sented (note that this is not necessarily the composer&rsquo;s native language) (see figure
5-4). However, if another title in the same language has become better known, this
other title should be selected. This may be discovered by checking for the work in
a thematic catalog or a reference source in the language in question. The title
referred to in 25.27 is the entire title proper, that is, everything preceding any other
title information. However, in the case of alternative titles, only one of the alterna-
tive titles is to be used as the selected title (although this will not necessarily be the
first of the alternative titles) (MCD 25.27, May 1989). If the title chosen under 25.27
is particularly long, it may be shortened (see 25.27C1 for details).
</p>
<p>25.28. ISOLATION OF INITIAL TITLE ELEMENT
</p>
<p>Once the appropriate title is selected, manipulate it by removing certain elements.
Most of these elements will be replaced in a prescribed order following the stip-
ulations of rules 25.30 and 25.31. This ensures that the title will file in a logical
manner.
</p>
<p>1. Remove any statement of medium of performance. For example, in figure
5-10, the title selected under 25.27 would be &ldquo;Sonata for piano, no. 3.&rdquo;
Remove &ldquo;for piano,&rdquo; leaving &ldquo;Sonata no. 3.&rdquo; Remove &ldquo;voor fluit, altviool
en piano&rdquo; from figure 5-16, leaving &ldquo;Trio, 1992.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>2. Remove the name of the key. The title selected under 25.27 for figure 5-12
would be &ldquo;Konzert Nr. 4 f&uuml;r Klavier (linke Hand) und Orchester, B-Dur,
opus 53.&rdquo; Remove the medium of performance (&ldquo;f&uuml;r Klavier (linke Hand)
und Orchester&rdquo;) and the key (&ldquo;B-Dur&rdquo;), leaving &ldquo;Konzert Nr. 4, opus 53.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>3. Remove the serial, opus, and thematic index numbers. The partially
manipulated example from figure 5-12 becomes &ldquo;Konzert Nr. 4&rdquo; by remov-
ing &ldquo;opus 53.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>MU S I C 165</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4. Remove numbers unless they are an integral part of the title (i.e., gram-
matically connected to the rest of the title). Figure 5-12, now shortened to
&ldquo;Konzert Nr. 4,&rdquo; becomes simply &ldquo;Konzert.&rdquo; Figure 5-10, already short-
ened to &ldquo;Sonata no. 3,&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Sonata.&rdquo; &ldquo;Eleven songs from A Shrop-
shire lad,&rdquo; figure 5-5, becomes &ldquo;Songs from A Shropshire lad.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>5. Remove a date of composition present in the title. Figure 5-16, already
reduced to &ldquo;Trio, 1992,&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Trio.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>6. Remove adjectives and epithets not part of the original title of the work. &ldquo;A
favorite waltz,&rdquo; figure 5-17, becomes &ldquo;A waltz.&rdquo;

<p>7. Remove an initial article. &ldquo;Die sch&ouml;ne M&uuml;llerin&rdquo; (figure 5-4) becomes
&ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne M&uuml;llerin&rdquo;; &ldquo;A waltz&rdquo; (figure 5-17) becomes &ldquo;Waltz.&rdquo; Initial arti-
cles are to be removed whether or not they appear in the nominative case
in languages that distinguish by case (see CSB 52, spring 1991, p. 26).
</p>
<p>25.29. FORMULATION OF INITIAL TITLE ELEMENT
</p>
<p>Once the initial title element has been isolated, it must be further manipulated.
Frequently, the application of rule 25.28 leaves nothing but the name of a type of
composition. In the above examples, figure 5-12 has become &ldquo;Konzert&rdquo; and figure
5-10 &ldquo;Sonata,&rdquo; both simply the names of types of composition. If this happens,
25.29 instructs the cataloger to translate this name into the accepted English form
of the name if it is cognate (etymologically related) to the French, German, or
Italian forms of the name. &ldquo;Konzert&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Concerto&rdquo;; &ldquo;Sonata&rdquo; remains the
same. Next, the cataloger is instructed to give the name in the plural unless it is
known that the composer only wrote one piece in this form. &ldquo;Concerto&rdquo; becomes
&ldquo;Concertos&rdquo;; &ldquo;Sonata&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Sonatas.&rdquo; LCRI 25.29A (Feb. 1, 1989) points out
that the medium of performance has nothing to do with the decision about
whether to use the singular or plural. In the case of figure 5-10, it is not a matter
of whether the composer wrote more than one piano sonata or not, but whether
he wrote more than one sonata. In the case of living composers, LC will use the
singular unless there is evidence (such as a serial number on the piece or catalog
records of other pieces of the same type) that the composer has written or intends
to write more than one work of the type. If the composer later, in fact, writes a
second work of the same type, LC will revise the earlier uniform title headings
(LCRI 25.29A, Feb. 1, 1989).
</p>
<p>25.30. ADDITIONS TO INITIAL TITLE ELEMENTS CONSISTING
OF THE NAME(S) OF ONE OR MORE TYPE(S) 
OF COMPOSITION
</p>
<p>The initial title element is the first part of the uniform title. It is recorded, as
explained above, in either the 240 or the 130 field of the MARC record, in subfield
&Dagger;a. Rules 25.30&ndash;25.31 instruct the cataloger to make various additions to the initial
title elements in certain cases. Each of these additions will be preceded by specific
subfield coding in the MARC record. Because the subfield coding and punctua-
tion is the same for both the 240 and the 130 fields (with the exception that the 130
field ends with a full stop while the 240 does not), no distinction will be made
between the fields in the explanation below.
</p>
<p>Rule 25.30 applies to initial title elements that have been reduced by the ap-
plication of rule 25.28 to nothing but the name (or names) of a type (or types) of
composition. It does not, therefore, apply to manipulated initial title elements
such as &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne M&uuml;llerin&rdquo; (figure 5-4) or &ldquo;Songs from A Shropshire lad&rdquo; (figure
5-5). It does, on the other hand, apply to &ldquo;Concertos&rdquo; (figure 5-12) and &ldquo;Sonatas&rdquo;
(figure 5-10). 25.30 instructs the cataloger to add to the initial title element most of
the items that were stripped off in the formulation of the initial title element, but
in a prescribed order, with each element preceded by a comma. This procedure
</p>
<p>MU S I C 167</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>results in a tight organization of the bibliographic file and produces a very useful
tool to the library user, especially in the case of prolific composers.
</p>
<p>25.30B. Medium of performance
</p>
<p>The first addition is medium of performance. In the MARC record, it is preceded
by comma - subfield &Dagger;m. In figure 5-10, &ldquo;Sonatas&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Sonatas, &Dagger;m piano&rdquo;;
in figure 5-12, &ldquo;Concertos&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Concertos, &Dagger;m piano, 1 hand, orchestra&rdquo; (for
the formulation &ldquo;piano, 1 hand,&rdquo; see 25.30B4). The subcategories of 25.30B give
standard terms that are to be used, standard groupings of instruments or voices,
prescribed orders when listing more than one instrument or voice, etc., and
should be consulted for complex situations. The cataloger should be specific, but
should not list more than three elements under the medium of performance sub-
section of the uniform title (for an exception, see 25.30B3). If more than three ele-
ments are present, it should be possible to group them under a more general
heading. Elements should be listed in the following order: voices, keyboard
instrument (if there is more than one nonkeyboard instrument&mdash;otherwise the
keyboard instrument is listed after the nonkeyboard instrument), other instru-
ments in score order, continuo.
</p>
<p>Do not add medium of performance to the uniform title when (a) the medium
is implied by the title (e.g., &ldquo;Symphonies&rdquo; implies &ldquo;orchestra,&rdquo; so there is no need
to add this to the uniform title; on the other hand, if a composer writes something
called a symphony for organ, the cataloger should add &ldquo;organ&rdquo; to the uniform
title because &ldquo;organ&rdquo; is not implied by the title); (b) the work is a set of composi-
tions for different media or is part of a series with the same title but for differing
media; (c) the composer has not designated the medium; or (d) stating the
medium would be so complex that another method of identifying the piece would
be more useful.
</p>
<p>25.30B4. Individual instruments. The rules give a choice of names for certain
instruments. LC, and libraries following LC, will use &ldquo;violoncello,&rdquo; &ldquo;English
horn,&rdquo; &ldquo;contrabassoon,&rdquo; and &ldquo;timpani&rdquo; (LCRI 25.30B4, Feb. 15, 1994). MCD 25.30B4
(Jan. 1990) states that the list of terms for keyboard instruments is not restrictive,
and other terms may be used if necessary. The key wording of AACR2 25.30B4 is
that the entire list is to be used as a guide to naming the instruments.
</p>
<p>25.30C. Numeric identifying elements
</p>
<p>Add (if readily ascertainable) in the following order (a) serial number and (b)
opus number or thematic index number. This element is preceded by comma -
subfield &Dagger;n. Figure 5-10 now expands to &ldquo;Sonatas, &Dagger;m piano, &Dagger;n no. 3&rdquo;; figure 
5-12 becomes &ldquo;Concertos, &Dagger;m piano, 1 hand, orchestra, &Dagger;n op. 53.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>25.30D. Key
</p>
<p>The next element that may be added to the uniform title is the key. It is preceded
by comma - subfield &Dagger;r. The cataloger is instructed to ascertain the key for any
piece composed before 1900; for pieces composed after 1899, the cataloger should
add the key only if it is &ldquo;stated prominently in the item being cataloged.&rdquo; &ldquo;Key&rdquo;
</p>
<p>168 MU S I C</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>includes mode (major or minor). Figure 5-12 now becomes &ldquo;Concertos, &Dagger;m piano,
1 hand, orchestra, &Dagger;n op. 53, &Dagger;r Bï¿½ major.&rdquo; English terms should be used in stating
the key (LCRI 25.30D, Jan. 5, 1989).
</p>
<p>25.30E. Other identifying elements
</p>
<p>If the preceding three additional elements still do not suffice to distinguish between
two or more works by the same composer, the cataloger may further add in
parentheses, in the following order, (a) the year of completion of the work, (b) the
year of its first publication, or (c) any other identifying elements, such as place of
composition, etc. A mass by a composer who wrote more than one mass in the
same key might have a uniform title such as:
</p>
<p>240 10 &Dagger;a Masses, &Dagger;r D minor &Dagger;n (1811)
</p>
<p>25.31. ADDITIONS TO OTHER INITIAL TITLE ELEMENTS
</p>
<p>The additions given in 25.30 are prescriptive; that is, when the initial title element
consists solely of a type or types of composition, the cataloger must add all of the
prescribed elements that are available. 25.31 addresses the situation where the
initial title element is not solely a type or types of composition (as &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne
M&uuml;llerin&rdquo; [figure 5-4] or &ldquo;Songs from A Shropshire lad&rdquo; [figure 5-5]). In this case,
all of the elements of 25.30 may be added to the uniform title, but only if they are
needed to resolve a conflict between uniform titles entered under the same
heading (see AACR2 25.31B1). The preferred method is to add either the medium
of performance (as instructed in 25.30B) or a descriptive phrase within parenthe-
ses (with no subfield coding) (see figure 5-14). If neither of these resolves the con-
flict, add other elements as instructed in 25.30.
</p>
<p>25.32. PARTS OF A WORK
</p>
<p>AACR2 25.32 is based on 25.6 and deals with the publication of only a part, rather
than the whole, of a work. The uniform title itself is identical to that of the whole
work. The cataloger will add to the uniform title a designation of the part,
whether that be a title or a number. If the part has a title, the cataloger should add
a name [i.e., that of the composer]-title reference for the subsidiary title to the
authority record for the uniform title for the part.
</p>
<p>If the part is identified by a number, the number should be preceded by a full
stop - subfield &Dagger;n. The example in AACR2 25.32A1(a) would be coded as follows:
</p>
<p>240 10 &Dagger;a Ungarische T&auml;nze. &Dagger;n Nr. 5
</p>
<p>If the part is identified by a title, the title should be preceded by a full stop -
subfield &Dagger;p. The two examples in AACR2 25.32A1(b) would be coded as follows:
</p>
<p>240 10 &Dagger;a A&iuml;da. &Dagger;p Celeste A&iuml;da
</p>
<p>240 10 &Dagger;a Symphonies, &Dagger;n no. 1, op. 21, &Dagger;r C major. &Dagger;p Andante 
cantabile con moto
</p>
<p>MU S I C 169</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Generally, if the part is designated both by a title and a number, prefer the
title. See, however, 25.32A1(c&ndash;d) for exceptions.
</p>
<p>If a publication contains more than one part of a work, follow the instructions
given in 25.6B. However, if the composer uses the name &ldquo;Suite&rdquo; for a group of
works, use that term rather than &ldquo;Selections&rdquo; (see figure 5-7).
</p>
<p>25.34. COLLECTIVE TITLES
</p>
<p>These are generally the same as those of 25.8. However, music uniform title prac-
tice includes a number of collective titles for broad media that do not exist for
other types of materials. The lists in 24.34C1&ndash;3 are examples of such collective
titles; however, these lists are not exclusive. They are meant to be examples on
which the cataloger may pattern collective titles to fit the item in hand.
</p>
<p>25.35. ADDITIONS FOR UNIFORM TITLES FOR MUSIC
</p>
<p>The following additions to uniform titles for music should be made in the order
given in 25.35.
</p>
<p>25.35C. Arrangements
</p>
<p>This rule requires the cataloger to distinguish between &ldquo;classical&rdquo; and &ldquo;popular&rdquo;
music, assuming that such a distinction can be made. It deals with an original
work that has been republished in a different arrangement, whether by the origi-
nal composer or by another. In the case of &ldquo;classical&rdquo; music, the piece will be cat-
aloged under the heading for the original composer, with the same uniform title
as the original composition. The uniform title will have &ldquo;arr.&rdquo; added to it, pre-
ceded by semicolon - &Dagger;o. An added entry will be made for the arranger (unless the
arranger is also the original composer) (see figures 5-2, 5-7, and 5-12). In the case
of &ldquo;popular&rdquo; music, &ldquo;arr.&rdquo; is added only if an instrumental work has been arranged
for voices or if a vocal work has been arranged for instruments.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress will not consider a work to be &ldquo;arranged&rdquo; for pur-
poses of this rule if a composer revises his own work, retaining the original title
and opus number, and the arrangement remains in the same broad medium and
is not an &ldquo;extensive overall revision [with] the introduction of new material.&rdquo; The
same uniform title, in these cases, is to be used for both the original and the
revised versions (MCD 25.35C, Apr. 1990). Such a work may, however, require an
edition statement in the edition area if one appears on the work.
</p>
<p>25.35D. Vocal and chorus scores
</p>
<p>Add &ldquo;Vocal score(s)&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chorus score(s)&rdquo; to the uniform title following full stop
- &Dagger;s if appropriate. As defined in AACR2 Appendix D (Glossary), a vocal score is
&ldquo;a score showing all vocal parts, with accompaniment, if any, arranged for key-
board instrument.&rdquo; A chorus score is &ldquo;a score of a vocal work showing only the
chorus parts, with accompaniment, if any, arranged for keyboard instrument.&rdquo;
The distinction is that a vocal score will show, in addition to the chorus parts of a
</p>
<p>170 MU S I C</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>work, any solo vocal parts as well. The uniform titles given as examples in
AACR2 25.35D1 would be coded as follows:
</p>
<p>240 10 &Dagger;a Messiah. &Dagger;s Vocal score
</p>
<p>240 10 &Dagger;a Mikado. &Dagger;s Chorus score
</p>
<p>240 10 &Dagger;a Operas. &Dagger;s Vocal scores
</p>
<p>These terms will be added to a uniform title whenever the item has been so
described in the physical description area (MCD 25.35D1, May 1989).
</p>
<p>25.35E. Librettos and song texts
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Libretto&rdquo; or &ldquo;Text&rdquo; should be added to the uniform title as appropriate follow-
ing full stop - &Dagger;s. Both terms refer to the publication of the words alone of vocal
or choral work. The distinction is that &ldquo;libretto&rdquo; is used for the words of an opera,
operetta, oratorio, etc., and &ldquo;text&rdquo; is used for the words of a song. The examples
in AACR2 25.35E1 would be coded as follows:
</p>
<p>240 10 &Dagger;a Forza del destino. &Dagger;s Libretto
</p>
<p>240 10 &Dagger;a Crocodile rock. &Dagger;s Text
</p>
<p>240 10 &Dagger;a Operas. &Dagger;s Librettos
</p>
<p>25.35F. Language
</p>
<p>If the text of a vocal or choral work has been translated, the name of the lan-
guage(s) should be added following full stop - subfield &Dagger;l (the letter l, not the
number 1) (see figure 5-4). This is the same as AACR2 25.5C. Note that if the work
is in its original language only, the cataloger is not to add the language to the
uniform title. This is so that all the copies of the work in its original language will
file before any translations.
</p>
<p>NOTE
</p>
<p>1. General information about MARC coding is found in the introduction to this Handbook;
details about coding the descriptive portion of the record are found throughout
chapter 1; information about the coding of main and added access points is found at
the beginning of chapter 14. An explanation of the MARC authorities format is given
in Handbook chapters 15, 17, and 18 and in Robert L. Maxwell, Maxwell&rsquo;s Guide to
Authority Work (Chicago: ALA, 2002). Information about specific MARC fields may be
found by consulting the index under &ldquo;MARC fields.&rdquo; A detailed overview of music
cataloging procedures is Richard P. Smiraglia&rsquo;s Describing Music Materials: A Manual for
Descriptive Cataloging of Printed and Recorded Music, Music Videos, and Archival Music
Collections, for Use with AACR2 and APPM, 3rd ed. (Lake Crystal, Minn.: Soldier Creek
Press, 1997).

<p>AACR2 chapter 6 includes rules for the description of all types of sound record-
ings. Note, however, that the rules in chapter 6 have nothing to say about choice
of main or added entries. For guidance on these matters the cataloger must turn
to AACR2 chapter 21 (&ldquo;Choice of Access Points&rdquo;). Additionally, chapter 6 does
not deal with the rules for uniform titles for musical works. Sound recordings of
music require a uniform title in the same situations as printed music. A uniform
title brings all the editions, versions, etc., of a musical composition together in the
same place in the catalog. Rules covering uniform titles for music are contained
in AACR2 chapter 25, particularly rules 25.25 through 25.35.
</p>
<p>This chapter of the Handbook will first discuss choice of access points for
sound recordings (AACR2 chapter 21) and then the bibliographic description of
sound recordings (AACR2 chapter 6). The formulation of music uniform titles,
which is the same whether applied to a score or a sound recording, is discussed
in Handbook chapter 5.
</p>
<p>AACR2 Chapter 21. Choice of Access Points
MAIN ENTRY
</p>
<p>Main entry for sound recordings is based on the same principles of authorship
governing other types of library materials: entry will be under &ldquo;the person chiefly
responsible for the creation of the intellectual or artistic content of a work&rdquo;
(21.1A1). This means, for the most part, that main entry will be under the com-
poser of a musical work that has been recorded, or the writer of a book or other
material that is being narrated, applying rules 21.1 through 21.22 as appropriate.
Frequently an individual performer or performing group is regarded as the
author of a sound recording and will be given main entry (21.23C). Because entry
for sound recordings presents special difficulties, a separate section in AACR2
chapter 21 is devoted to rules governing this type of material. These may be briefly
summarized.

<p>21.23A. Sound recording of one work
</p>
<p>Enter a sound recording of one work under the person or body chiefly responsi-
ble for the intellectual or musical content of the work, following general rules as
indicated above.
</p>
<p>A sound recording of a single work of a composer will be entered under the
name of the composer (see figure 6-1).1 Form for entry of the composer&rsquo;s name is
governed by AACR2 chapter 22 (&ldquo;Headings for Persons&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>A sound recording of a text will be entered under the heading appropriate to
the text, as long as the narrator retains the original words (see figure 6-2). And, of
course, a recording of text may be an original work never intended for any other
medium (see figure 6-3). What more effective way could there be for a master story-
teller to reveal some of her secrets than orally?

<p>The cataloger should be reminded that a sound recording may be issued as a
serial. In most instances, a serial sound recording will include works by more
than one person or group, performed by more than three performers or groups,
because a serial by definition is a publication intended to be continued indefi-
nitely (see AACR2 chapter 12). Such a serial will usually be entered under title.
For an example of a serial sound recording, see figure 6-8.

<p>ADDED ENTRIES
</p>
<p>21.29D [Added entries other than 21.30], 21.30A. 
Two or more persons or bodies involved
</p>
<p>AACR2 21.30A prescribes that no more than three added entries should be made
for persons or bodies performing the same function. If more than three persons or
bodies are involved, an added entry is to be made only for the one named first in
the source. North American practice for sound recordings does not follow the
restrictions set forth in 21.30A. Taking a lead from 21.29D, which allows more
added entries than those prescribed in 21.30 if required &ldquo;in the context of a given
catalogue,&rdquo; the Library of Congress has issued a rule interpretation for sound
recordings that is followed by most North American libraries (see LCRI 21.29D,
Jan. 5, 1989; Feb. 1, 1989). Under this rule interpretation, an added entry is to be</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>made for all performers named on a sound recording, whether persons or corpo-
rate bodies. For examples, see figures 6-1 and 6-7. There are a few exceptions; the
most notable is that if a performing group is on the record as an entry, and the
members of the group are also listed on the item, the individual members are not
all given entries (see figure 6-4). See the LCRI for other exceptions.
</p>
<p>ANALYTICS
</p>
<p>21.7. COLLECTIONS OF WORKS BY DIFFERENT PERSONS OR BODIES
</p>
<p>Sound recordings are frequently published as collections and as such fall under
AACR2 21.7. AACR2 21.7B and 21.7C call for name-title added entries for the
works in such compilations if there are two or three. More than three of these
&ldquo;analytical&rdquo; added entries are not permitted. However, as with added entries for
performers, the Library of Congress has made an exception for sound recordings.
Under LCRIs 21.7B and 21.7C (May 19, 1994), if the collection contains twenty-
five or fewer musical works, up to fifteen analytical entries may be made. There
are a number of instructions allowing these twenty-five to be condensed to fifteen
entries (e.g., if one of the persons [composers] involved is represented on the
recording by three or more works, a collective uniform title such as &ldquo;Selections&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Piano music&rdquo; is to be used, condensing the works to a single entry). The ana-
lytics are not to be made if
</p>
<p>1. more than fifteen analytical entries would be required;
2. the collection contains pop, folk, ethnic, or jazz music;
3. the collection is oriented toward the performer(s) or instrument(s) 
</p>
<p>rather than the musical repertoire; or
4. the collection is a multipart recording that is incomplete at the time 
</p>
<p>of cataloging.
</p>
<p>Thus, analytical added entries are made for the recording cataloged in figure
6-6, a collection of Renaissance choral music. They are not made for the recording
cataloged in figure 6-7, a collection of popular songs.

</p>
<p>6.0B1. Chief source of information. Although chapter 6 includes rules for diverse
types of sound recordings, the chief source of information is the same in all cases.
The label affixed to the recording is the preferred source. If the item includes more
than one label (as, for instance, a phonograph disc), both labels are regarded as one
source. For a disc, the disc itself is also part of the chief source. For tape, the reel,
cassette, or cartridge is also considered part of the chief source. For any type of
sound recording, accompanying textual material or a container may be used as the
chief source of information whenever it furnishes a collective title not found on the
parts or their labels. In this case, make a note to indicate the source. According to
Music Cataloging Decisions, &ldquo;For compact discs and cassettes, consider information
which can be read through the closed container (including information on the front
cover of a booklet inserted in the container) to be on the container&rdquo; (MCD 6.0B1).

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.1B. Title proper
</p>
<p>The chief source of information must be used in transcribing the title proper (see
AACR2 1.1B for general rules governing such transcription). The title proper is
transcribed in subfield &Dagger;a of the 245 field.
</p>
<p>In addition, when transcribing the title of a musical work, refer to 5.1B. In the
example shown in figure 6-9, the title proper consists of the generic term &ldquo;Con-
certo,&rdquo; the key, and the thematic index number. As previously mentioned, a
uniform title is included with sound recordings under the same circumstances as
in music cataloging (see 25.25&ndash;25.35 for rules on uniform titles for music, dis-
cussed in chapter 5 in this Handbook).
</p>
<p>6.1C. Optional addition. General material designation
</p>
<p>Following Library of Congress practice, most catalogers will use the general
material designation (GMD) &ldquo;sound recording&rdquo; for all types of sound recordings.
It is added immediately following the title proper in subfield &Dagger;h.
</p>
<p>6.1E. Other title information
</p>
<p>Other title information follows the GMD (see figure 6-10, etc.). See general rules
under 1.1E for punctuation and transcription.

<p>6.1F. Statements of responsibility
</p>
<p>The statement of responsibility is to be transcribed according to general instruc-
tions found in 1.1F. However, a special exception to the general rules is made for
the transcription of statements of responsibility for sound recordings. Names of
narrators or performers are in most cases omitted and given in the note area (see
AACR2 6.7B6). The statement of responsibility is limited to writers, composers,
and collectors of field material if these names appear prominently (see, for
instance, figures 6-1 and 6-2). The rule does allow performers who do more than
perform to be named in the statement of responsibility. The Library of Congress
instructs its catalogers to accept only the most obvious cases of this situation
(LCRI 6.1F1, Jan. 5, 1989).

<p>6.1F3. A short phrase may be added to clarify an ambiguous statement of
responsibility as shown in figure 6-11.
</p>
<p>6.1G. Items without a collective title
</p>
<p>Items without a collective title may be handled in either of two ways. According to
6.1G2, such an item may be described as a unit (see figure 6-12). See 1.1G for general
instructions on procedures and for prescribed punctuation. If all of the selections
are by a single composer, the titles are separated by space - semicolon - space.
</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, selections on a sound recording lacking a collective title
are by more than one composer, and if the item is to be described as a unit, make
entry as shown in figure 6-13.
</p>
<p>The cataloger should remember that when the disc label does not provide a
collective title, but the container or accompanying textual material does, the latter
should be treated as the chief source for purposes of transcribing the title and
statement of responsibility (see AACR2 6.0B1). Give the source of the title in a
note. Figure 6-14 is an example of such a situation. Note that in this example, the
title&mdash;which appears on the front of the booklet accompanying the CD&mdash;is
regarded as coming from the container since it is visible through the closed CD
jewel box (see discussion above under 6.0B1).
</p>
<p>6.1G4. Optionally, the cataloger may make a separate catalog entry for each
item without a collective title. One side of the sound recording cataloged as a unit in
figure 6-13 appears in figure 6-9. The other side of the recording would be cataloged

<p>6.4. PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION, ETC., AREA
</p>
<p>6.4C. Place of publication, distribution, etc.
</p>
<p>General rules under 1.4C are to be followed. The prescribed sources of informa-
tion for the entire publication area include the chief source of information, any
accompanying textual material, or the container, in that order of preference. If
place or other elements of this area are taken from sources other than these, they
must be enclosed in brackets.
</p>
<p>The cataloger must often search to find the place of publication, distribution,
etc., because this information is frequently omitted from the recording and its
accompanying material. The following reference sources should prove helpful:
</p>
<p>Billboard International Buyer&rsquo;s Guide (annual). New York: Billboard
Publications, 1970&ndash; . Popular recording companies.
</p>
<p>British Music Yearbook (annual). London: [various publishers], 1975&ndash;1998,
continued as British and International Music Yearbook, 1999&ndash; . British
classical recording companies.
</p>
<p>Musical America: International Directory of the Performing Arts (annual).
Great Barrington, Mass.: ABC Leisure Magazines, 1974&ndash; . North
American recording companies.
</p>
<p>Pavlakis, Christopher. The American Music Handbook. New York: Free
Press, 1974. Chiefly classical music, American sources.
</p>

updated ed. New York: Da Capo Press, 1989. Recording companies
specializing in folk music.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Publishers&rsquo; official web sites are also good sources of information about place of
publication.
</p>
<p>6.4D2. Name of publisher, distributor, etc. Prefer a trade or brand name
rather than the name of the publisher if both appear on the label. Prefer label
information rather than information appearing in accompanying material or on
the container. See, for instance, figure 6-9. The brand name &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; will be pre-
ferred to the name of the manufacturer, Capitol Records, Inc. In figure 6-11, MGM
Records is listed as &ldquo;A division of Loew&rsquo;s Incorporated.&rdquo; Prefer the name of the
division to that of the parent body.
</p>
<p>6.4D3. Trade name as series. The example shown in figure 6-16 includes a
trade name that appears to be a series. It should be recorded as such, rather than
used as the name of the publisher.

<p>(see figure 6-1, etc.). Note that a copyright date appearing on the container or ac-
companying matter applies to the printed text, not the recording. It may be used,
however, as evidence for supplying a date of publication according to 1.4F7 if
neither a date of publication nor a pressing date appears on the item (LCRI 6.4F1,
May 2001).
</p>
<p>If the pressing date is being transcribed (usually appearing on the item with
the symbol P ), precede it by a lowercase &ldquo;p&rdquo; (see figures 6-1, 6-5, etc.).

<p>6.5. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AREA
</p>
<p>6.5B1. Extent of item (including specific material designation). State the number
of physical units, together with the specific type of sound recording, using terms
listed under 6.5B1 in subfield &Dagger;a of the 300 field. Libraries that do not choose to
include the general material designation &ldquo;sound recording&rdquo; as part of the catalog
entry should include the word &ldquo;sound&rdquo; as part of the specific designation. Op-
tionally, if &ldquo;sound recording&rdquo; has been included as the GMD in the entry, the
word &ldquo;sound&rdquo; may be dropped as being redundant from the specific material
designation. Following Library of Congress decision, this will not be done in cat-
aloging examples in this text (LCRI 6.5B1, Feb. 2001).
</p>
<p>6.5B2. In many cases, playing time is included on the item as part of the
information on the label, container, or accompanying material. If this is the case,
such information should be included in the physical description area, following
instructions under AACR2 1.5B4 (see, e.g., figure 6-1). If the total duration does
not appear on the item, but the durations of all its parts do, the cataloger may add
them together, rounding to the nearest minute. Do not add &ldquo;ca.&rdquo; to a duration cal-
culated in this manner (LCRI 6.5B2, Jan. 5, 1989) (see figure 6-6).
</p>
<p>If playing time is not stated on the item, give it only if it is &ldquo;readily ascertain-
able.&rdquo; In most cases where playing time is not listed, it will not be included in the
physical description of the item. Rule 1.5B4c indicates that, optionally, the cata-
loger may give an approximate time, with minutes preceded by the abbreviation
&ldquo;ca.&rdquo; The Library of Congress will not implement this option and will only use
&ldquo;ca.&rdquo; if it appears on the item (LCRI 6.5B2, Jan. 5, 1989).
</p>
<p>6.5B3. If a separately titled part of a sound recording has been cataloged as an
independent work, give the physical extent as shown in figures 6-9 and 6-15.
</p>
<p>6.5C. Other physical details
</p>
<p>Whereas for visual materials, such as a book, it is appropriate to give details such
as the presence of illustrations or color as part of this element, for a sound record-
ing the analogous items are type of recording (analog or digital), playing speed,
number of tracks, number of sound channels, etc. These details are separated
from the extent of the item by space - colon - space and preceded by subfield &Dagger;b.
</p>
<p>All sound recordings requiring analog playback equipment (12-inch long-
playing discs, cassettes, etc.) must be described as &ldquo;analog&rdquo; (see figure 6-2). Discs
requiring digital playback equipment (e.g., &ldquo;compact&rdquo; or &ldquo;laser&rdquo; discs) are de-
scribed as &ldquo;digital&rdquo; (see figure 6-17).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.5D. Dimensions
</p>
<p>The size of the item is always the last element in the physical description area
unless accompanying material is present. It is separated from the other physical
details element by space - semicolon - space and subfield &Dagger;c. Unlike most other
library items, sound recording discs are measured in inches, because this is the
standard measurement used in the recording industry.2 Dimensions are omitted
for rolls, cartridges, and cassettes if they are standard size.
</p>
<p>6.5E. Accompanying material
</p>
<p>As explained under 1.5E, accompanying material may be added as the last
element of the physical description area if its description is simple. Figure 6-18
shows an example of a recording issued as a serial. Each disc is accompanied by
a booklet containing the text of the disc so that the child listener can read along
with the recording. Because the booklets were issued regularly with the record-
ings, they may be added as the last element of the physical description area
(12.5E1).
</p>
<p>If authorship or publication details are different from those on the main item
being cataloged, either give the accompanying material a separate entry (1.5E1; see
figure 1-92) or list the accompanying material in a note (6.7B11; see figure 6-2).

<p>6.7. NOTE AREA
</p>
<p>Notes follow the general order and are of the same type as notes listed under 1.7;
see discussion at 1.7 in this Handbook.
</p>
<p>6.7B1. Nature or artistic form and medium of performance. If the form or
medium of performance for a musical work is not evident from the title or the
uniform title, a note should be given (see figure 6-5). This is recorded in a 500 field.
</p>
<p>6.7B2. Language. Such a note is appropriate either for spoken or sung record-
ings unless the language is evident from the rest of the description (see figure 6-6
for an instance in which a note about the language is appropriate). Use a 546 field
for this note.
</p>
<p>6.7B3. Source of title proper. See discussion under 6.0B1 for circumstances in
which the cataloger should give a note in a 500 field indicating the source of the
title proper (see figure 6-14).
</p>
<p>6.7B4. Variations in title. Rather frequently, title information on the record
sleeve or other container will differ, sometimes markedly, from title information
on the label of the item. If the difference is enough to affect filing and is distinc-
tive enough to be useful, give it a separate title added entry (see figure 6-19). A
note will be generated from the 246 field (see discussion in the Handbook at 1.7B4).

<p>6.7B6. Statements of responsibility. As already noted, names of performers
ordinarily are not transcribed as part of the formal statement of responsibility in
the body of the entry. The names of the principal performers (singers, readers,

essary. The note may be quoted from the prescribed source if it is concise; other-

<p>6.7B7. Edition and history. Note the date and place of recording in a 518 field
if it is readily ascertainable (i.e., if it is mentioned on the disc or in the accompa-
nying material) (see figures 6-1, 6-2, etc.).
</p>
<p>6.7B10. Physical description. In addition to other important physical details,
duration times may be given for a multipart item without a collective title that has
been described as a unit (see figure 6-13). Notes on physical description are
recorded in 500 fields.
</p>
<p>It is customary to include a note clarifying the type of disc described for
compact discs and later formats. See figure 6-17 for a note of this type. This note
originally began to be added to records for sound recordings with the advent of
compact discs because it was thought that library users would not recognize the
format from the physical description area. Now that there are other formats of the
same size as CDs (e.g., DVD-Audio), the note has become even more necessary.
</p>
<p>Some libraries note the three-letter code found on compact discs, e.g.,
&ldquo;Compact disc (ADD).&rdquo; Such a note assumes that the catalog user understands
the meaning of the code, which may become a more valid assumption as people
become accustomed to the terminology of compact discs. There are basically three
codes, DDD, ADD, and AAD. In any of the three positions, &ldquo;D&rdquo; stands for
&ldquo;digital&rdquo; and &ldquo;A&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;analog.&rdquo; The letter in the first position indicates the
type of recording made at the original recording session; the second position indi-
cates the type of equipment used during mixing and editing; the third position
indicates the type of equipment used in mastering the disc itself. Thus, DDD
means that all aspects of the recording, from the original session to the mastering,
are digital; ADD means that the original recording was analog, but mixing,
editing, and mastering were digital; and AAD means that the original recording
and the mixing or editing were analog, but the final disc mastering was digital.
</p>
<p>6.7B11. Accompanying material. See figures 6-1, 6-2, etc., for appropriate
notes.
</p>
<p>6.7B14. Audience. As for other types of materials, an audience note may be
appropriate for a sound recording (see figure 6-18 and discussion in Handbook at
1.7B14).
</p>
<p>6.7B16. Other formats. If other formats (disc, cartridge, cassette, etc.) are
known, this fact is given in a 530 note (see figure 6-5). The cataloger should not
do extensive research to discover this information.
</p>
<p>6.7B17. Summary. A brief summary may be given in the 520 field for the con-
tents of a spoken sound recording (see figures 6-2, 6-10, and 6-18).
</p>
<p>6.7B18. Contents. List titles of individual works cataloged under a collective
title in a 505 field. Follow title and statement of responsibility pattern as directed
in 1.7B18. If time is given for individual works, include this information (see, for
example, figure 6-5). If the recording is of a single musical work, individual
movements may be listed in a contents note (see MCD 5.7B18 and 6.7B18).
</p>
<p>6.7B19. Publishers&rsquo; numbers. In MARC format publishers&rsquo; numbers for
sound recordings are not recorded in a note (5XX) field; rather they are recorded
in the 028 field with the indicators &ldquo;02.&rdquo; The number is recorded in subfield &Dagger;a;
the source (usually the name of the record company) is recorded in subfield &Dagger;b.
The indicators &ldquo;02&rdquo; cause the system to generate a note to the patron with the
display &ldquo;Publisher no.:.&rdquo; See figures throughout this chapter.

<p>NOTES
</p>
<p>1. General information about MARC coding is found in the introduction to this Handbook;
details about coding the descriptive portion of the record are found throughout
chapter 1; information about the coding of main and added access points is found at
the beginning of chapter 14. An explanation of the MARC authorities format is given
in Handbook chapters 15, 17, and 18 and in Robert L. Maxwell, Maxwell&rsquo;s Guide to
Authority Work (Chicago: ALA, 2002). Information about specific MARC fields may be
found by consulting the index under &ldquo;MARC fields.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>2. The National Library of Canada has made a policy decision to use metric measure-
ments throughout the catalog record, including the dimensions of sound recordings
(NLCRI 1.5, 6.5). A Canadian library should therefore record, for example, &ldquo;30 cm.&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;12 in.&rdquo; for a standard LP, &ldquo;12 cm.&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;4 3/4 in.&rdquo; for a CD. Other
libraries will continue to measure sound recordings in inches.

<p>AACR2 chapter 7 includes rules for the descriptive cataloging of all types of
media involving a sequence of images projected in rapid succession so that they
create the illusion of movement. These include videorecordings and DVDs with
all of their manifestations. Also included are motion pictures, which come in
many packages such as film cartridges and film cassettes as well as film reels.
Filmstrips are not included in this chapter. For rules governing filmstrips, see
AACR2 chapter 8, &ldquo;Graphic Materials.&rdquo;1
</p>
<p>The problem of main entry for motion pictures has troubled catalogers for
many years. British cataloging authority Anthony Croghan felt that a film &ldquo;is a
collaborative work, and there are essentially three authors: the director, the cam-
eraman, and the scriptwriter. The director is the principal author, and the cam-
eraman and scriptwriter are secondary authors.&rdquo;2 Following Croghan&rsquo;s line of
reasoning, main entry for films would be the name of the director. But Croghan&rsquo;s
idea has had little support among catalogers. Previous cataloging codes were in
agreement in stipulating title main entry for motion pictures.
</p>
<p>The present rules for choice of access points (AACR2 chapter 21) make no
specific mention of motion pictures as such; the same rules of authorship respon-
sibility that govern other types of library materials are to be applied to motion
pictures and videorecordings. In most instances, numerous people and many dif-
ferent groups contribute in various ways to the creation of the intellectual or artis-
tic content of a motion picture or videorecording (see figures 7-1 and 7-2).3
Because of this diffusion of responsibility, main entry for most motion pictures
will continue to be under title according to AACR2 practice as it was under pre-
vious rules.

</p>
<p>Motion pictures are frequently based on books. Entry for such works nor-
mally is covered by 21.9, because in virtually every instance such versions involve
substantial changes in the nature and content of the original, to say nothing of the
fact that the medium of expression is different. AACR2 rule 21.9 stipulates that
main entry will be under the heading &ldquo;appropriate to the new work.&rdquo; Because

<p>many individuals normally are involved in the production of films, entry under
the name of an adapter is usually not possible. Title main entry should be made,
with a name-title added entry for the original work (see figures 7-2 and 7-5).
</p>
<p>The example shown in figure 7-6 is an unusual twist on the standard pattern
of a motion picture adaptation of a previously published book. In this case, the
motion picture was produced first, followed a year later by a faithful reproduc-
tion in book format under the same title, Arrow to the Sun. The film and the book,
which won the Caldecott Award, are both by Gerald McDermott. He wrote the
script of the motion picture, designed and drew the animated cartoons, and
directed and produced the entire film. His responsibility for the intellectual and
artistic content of the film is clear. Entry is under his name. In the record for the
book, a note is made to indicate publication of the film version (see figure 7-7).
</p>
<p>Examples given above illustrate several ways of entering a motion picture in
the library catalog. The rules for main entry for motion pictures may be summa-
rized by stating once again that general principles governing authorship apply to
motion pictures as well as to other types of library materials. If authorship
responsibility can be attributed by definitions and rules of 21.1, entry will be
under personal or corporate author. However, the difficulties involved in ascrib-
ing authorship or creator responsibility for most motion pictures mean that, as a
general rule, they will be entered under title.

</p>
<p>7.0B. Sources of information
</p>
<p>The chief source of information for films, as it is for other library items, is the item
itself. When a book is cataloged, the title page is the chief source of information.
By analogy the chief source of information for a film is the title frame(s). Note
carefully the definition of title frame in AACR2 Appendix D: &ldquo;A frame containing
written or printed material not part of the subject content of the item.&rdquo; No stipu-
lation is made about the location of the title frames. Therefore, they may be found
at the beginning or at the end of the film, or in both places. If the film is perma-
nently encased in a cassette or cartridge, a label appearing on this container is also
regarded as a chief source, although information from the item itself (e.g., the title
frames) is preferred.
</p>
<p>Some films lack title frames. If no printed information appears on the film or
its integral container, accompanying material may furnish information or a title
presented orally on the film may be used.
</p>
<p>7.1. TITLE AND STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY AREA
</p>
<p>The title and statement of responsibility must be transcribed from the chief
source&mdash;in most cases, the title frame(s) of the film but also the container if the
container is an integral part of the piece. Title frames at the beginning of the film
and frames at the end may include pertinent information to be recorded in the
title and statement of responsibility area. Some information on the title or end
frames may be given about individuals whose contribution to the film is best
included in the note area (7.1F1, 7.7B6). Other information may be ignored if it is
not important to the cataloging agency. If material is omitted from transcription
of title and end frames, do not indicate such omission by ellipses.
</p>
<p>7.1B. Title proper
</p>
<p>Transcribe the title in subfield &Dagger;a of the 245 field as it appears on the title frame(s),
following the general rules under 1.1B. If the title frames include a statement of
responsibility, transcribe it as it appears (see figure 7-6). However, pay close atten-
tion to the second paragraph of 1.1B1, newly added in 2002. Motion picture title
statements often include &ldquo;words that serve as an introduction and are not
intended to be part of the title.&rdquo; These are not transcribed. Additionally, do not
consider credits for performer, author, director, producer, etc., that precede or
follow the title to be part of the title proper, even though they are grammatically
integral to the title. The title proper of &ldquo;Twentieth Century Fox presents Star
Wars&rdquo; is &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo;; that of &ldquo;Steve McQueen in  Bullitt&rdquo; is &ldquo;Bullitt&rdquo; (see LCRI
7.1B1, June 2002, for further details). In figure 7-6, the title proper of &ldquo;Texture
Films, inc., presents Arrow to the Sun&rdquo; is &ldquo;Arrow to the sun&rdquo; (see also figure 7-5).
</p>
<p>7.1C. Optional addition. General material designation
</p>
<p>Add in brackets &ldquo;motion picture&rdquo; or &ldquo;videorecording&rdquo; as appropriate, immedi-
ately following the title proper and subfield &Dagger;h. &ldquo;Videorecording&rdquo; is used with
anything that is not film, e.g., videocassettes, DVDs, etc.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>MO T I O N PI C T U R E S A N D VI D E O R E C O R D I N G S 201
</p>
<p>7.1C2. A sound track is considered a part of a motion picture or videorecord-
ing even if it is physically separate from the film, so long as it is &ldquo;synchronized
with the item and intended to be played with it.&rdquo; The general material designa-
tion (GMD) appropriate to the film should be used. A large film library may, how-
ever, have sound track film not accompanied by visual material. These should be
cataloged using the rules of AACR2 chapter 6, with GMDs appropriate to that
chapter (see 7.0A1).
</p>
<p>7.1E. Other title information
</p>
<p>Other title information is transcribed, following general rule 1.1E, as it appears in
the chief source of information (see figure 7-8).

</p>
<p>7.1F. Statements of responsibility
</p>
<p>Ordinarily, three types of activity enter into the creation of a motion picture. The
sponsor, if the film has one, has a primary role that often includes promoting the
initial idea of the film, financing the production, and arranging for production.
Boeing Company is the sponsor of the film illustrated by figure 7-4. The producer
or production company is responsible for the mechanics of making the motion
picture. In figure 7-2, Warner Bros. Pictures is a production company. A releasing
agent issues the completed motion picture to the public. In figure 7-5, Walt Disney
Home Video is a releasing agent.
</p>
<p>7.1F1. This rule limits information included in the statement of responsibility
to persons or bodies actually involved in the production of the film. While flexi-
ble and allowing for cataloger judgment, the rule generally limits persons or
bodies named in the statement of responsibility to producers, directors, anima-
tors, and writers. The name of the releasing agent or distributor is given as part
of the publication area; names of other persons or groups, such as principal per-
formers, etc., are given in a note, even if they appear in the chief source of infor-
mation. The rationale for this distinction is that the sponsoring body, the pro-
ducer, etc., have a type of author-creator responsibility; thus, these names, if they</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>202 MO T I O N PI C T U R E S A N D VI D E O R E C O R D I N G S
</p>
<p>are listed in the chief source of information, should be transcribed as part of the
statement of responsibility. If such names are not listed in the chief source, and
their relationship to the film should be brought out, give the information in a note
(see figure 7-4: the title frame for this film gives title only. Sponsor information was
found in Educator&rsquo;s Guide to Free Films, 1973). The releasing agent and the distribu-
tor perform different functions; these names may appear in the publication area.
</p>
<p>7.1F2. If the relationship between the work and a person or body named in
the statement of responsibility is not clear, add a word or phrase in brackets (see
figures 7-2 and 7-3).
</p>
<p>7.1F3. If the names of both the sponsor and the producer are given in a single
statement of responsibility, the information will be so transcribed. Whether the
sponsor&rsquo;s name is given as the main entry depends, obviously, on the nature of the
material (see AACR2 21.1B2 for guidance). In the example shown in figure 7-3,
main entry is under the name of the sponsor (agency for which the film was pro-
duced) because the film concerns itself with the activities of the sponsor (21.1B2a).
</p>
<p>7.1G. Items without a collective title
</p>
<p>7.1G1. The Library of Congress will describe the item as a unit (LCRI 7.1G1, Aug.
2001), as will the National Library of Canada (NLCRI 7.1G1).
</p>
<p>7.4. PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION, ETC., AREA
</p>
<p>7.4C. Place of publication, distribution, etc.
</p>
<p>Place is always included as the first element of the publication, distribution, etc.,
area. However, this information is not always given on the film, nor is it always
included with the material that may accompany the film. The following are good
sources of general information about films that will be helpful in giving the loca-
tion of distributors, releasing agents, etc.

</p>
<p>7.4D. Name of publisher, distributor, etc.
</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, note that the name of the releasing agent and distribu-
tor are among the types of bodies that may be included as the second element of
this area (see figure 7-5).
</p>
<p>7.4F. Date of publication, distribution, release, etc.
</p>
<p>The date is recorded as the last element of the area. A date of original production
that is different from the distribution date may optionally be given in the note
area (see figure 7-1, note 2). The Library of Congress will apply this option if the
difference in dates is more than two years (LCRI 7.4F2, Jan. 5, 1989).
</p>
<p>7.5. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AREA
</p>
<p>The physical description area for motion pictures and videorecordings, like the
physical description area for other types of library materials, is divided into the
three major elements described in 7.5B&ndash;7.5D.
</p>
<p>7.5B. Extent of item
</p>
<p>The number of physical units followed by one of the specific material designators
listed under 7.5B1 is the first element in the physical description area. Most of
these are self-explanatory. DVD and similar formats are described as &ldquo;videodisc.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>If the GMD is used following the title proper, the word &ldquo;film&rdquo; or prefix
&ldquo;video&rdquo; may be omitted from the specific material designator. Following Library
of Congress practice, &ldquo;film&rdquo; and &ldquo;video&rdquo; have not been omitted from specific
material designation in this text (LCRI 1.1C, Aug. 2001).
</p>
<p>7.5B2. If the playing time is stated on the item, on the container, or elsewhere,
it is listed following the extent of the item (see 1.5B4).
</p>
<p>7.5C. Other physical details
</p>
<p>For all types of motion pictures and videorecordings, indicate whether the film is
sound or silent, and whether it is in color or black and white. In addition, give
other special characteristics as stipulated in the rules.
</p>
<p>7.5D. Dimensions
</p>
<p>The critical dimension for a motion picture or a videorecording, because it affects
hardware used for playback, is the width of the film. A motion picture film is
measured in millimeters, a videotape in inches or millimeters, as appropriate;
videodiscs (laser discs, DVDs) are measured in inches.5 Figure 7-1 is an example
of the stipulation in 7.5D2 for 8 mm films.
</p>
<p>7.5E. Accompanying material
</p>
<p>Follow directions in 1.5E for recording accompanying material at the end of the
physical description area. For example, see figure 7-1.</p>

</p>
<p>7.7. NOTE AREA
</p>
<p>Notes follow the general order and are based on types given under 1.7.
7.7B2. Language. Notes indicating the presence of a foreign language not
</p>
<p>evident from the rest of the description are recorded in the 546 field (see figure 7-9).
Also included under this type of note is the presence of closed-captioning. If
</p>
<p>the film is closed-captioned, give the note &ldquo;Closed-captioned&rdquo; in a 500 field (see
figure 7-5).
</p>
<p>7.7B6. Statements of responsibility. This note lists persons or bodies not
&ldquo;credited in the chief source of information with a major role in creating&rdquo; the film
or with its sponsorship and, thus, according to 7.1F1, not to be given in the title
and statement of responsibility area in the formal part of the description. This
note is flexible; list names considered by the cataloging agency to be of impor-
tance (see, e.g., figures 7-5, 7-6, and 7-8). Principal cast members may be noted in
field 511 (see figure 7-9). If notes are from production credits, names of persons
other than cast members (e.g., editors, cinematographers, costume designers, etc.)

</p>
<p>7.7B10. Physical description. (7.7B10f, Videorecording system.) Because motion
pictures and videorecordings are produced in so many different formats and the
choice of specific material designations (7.5B1) is limited, the cataloger should
inform the catalog user what system will be necessary to play the film for unusual
formats, especially for different types of discs. This information is recorded in a
MARC 538 field. For examples, see figures 7-2, 7-8 and 7-9.6
</p>
<p>7.7B14. Audience. MPAA ratings, if known, are recorded in a 521 field (see
figure 7-9).
</p>
<p>7.7B17. Summary. Because film and videorecording collections are not easy to
browse through, a brief summary note is important unless the content of the item
is evident from other parts of the catalog entry (see previous examples).
Sometimes such a note may combine information about the content of the film
and persons responsible for it, as in the example shown in figure 7-10. A summary
note is recorded in the 520 field.
</p>
<p>7.7B19. Numbers. Most numbers borne by an item aside from ISBN or ISSN
should be given in a 500 field if considered important by the cataloging agency.
Publishers&rsquo; numbers, however, should be given in the 028 field with the indica-
tors coded &ldquo;42&rdquo; (see figures 7-5 and 7-9).

<p>1. This chapter does not cover the cataloging of archival film collections, which can be
quite different from AACR2 cataloging. For full information on this type of cataloging,

</p>
<p>3. General information about MARC coding is found in the introduction to this Handbook;
details about coding the descriptive portion of the record are found throughout
chapter 1; information about the coding of main and added access points is found at
the beginning of chapter 14. An explanation of the MARC authorities format is given
in Handbook chapters 15, 17, and 18 and in Robert L. Maxwell, Maxwell&rsquo;s Guide to
Authority Work (Chicago: ALA, 2002). Information about specific MARC fields may be
found by consulting the index under &ldquo;MARC fields.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>4. A sponsor is &ldquo;the company, institution, organization, or individual other than the pro-
ducer who finances the production of the material. Sponsorship often involves the pro-
motion, either directly or indirectly, of a product or point of view&rdquo; (Alma M. Tillin and
William J. Quinly, Standards for Cataloging Nonprint Materials, 4th ed. [Washington,
D.C.: AECT, 1976], p. 16).
</p>
<p>5. As allowed under AACR2 0.28, the National Library of Canada will use only metric
measurements throughout the record (NLCRI 1.5, 7.5). Canadian libraries will not use
inches in area 7.5.
</p>
<p>6. In addition to the note required by 7.7B10f, the National Library of Australia has
authorized Australian catalogers to include this information in the extent of item part
of the physical description area (7.5B1), as &ldquo;1 videocassette (VHS)&rdquo; (NLARI 7.5B1).
This technique is also used by archival catalogers using AMIM (see above, note 1). The
practice had been authorized under certain circumstances by AACR2 (1978) rules, but
was discontinued under later versions of AACR2, so nonarchival catalogers outside of
Australia should only give the note.</p>

<p>AACR2 chapter 7 dealt with rules for the description of pictures that give the illu-
sion of movement when projected. In contrast, chapter 8 covers all kinds of two-
dimensional graphic materials, both opaque and transparent. Chapter 10 deals
with three-dimensional materials.
</p>
<p>The full rules given in chapter 8, as in other sections of AACR2 Part I, are
appropriate only for the description and identification of materials felt to be of
significance and of some permanent importance to the library&rsquo;s collection. Some
of the kinds of graphic materials included in chapter 8 may be ephemeral in
nature; these may be more appropriately cataloged according to minimum levels
of description (see 1.0D) or possibly kept in a vertical file without cataloging.
Examples and discussion in this text assume full cataloging.
</p>
<p>Elizabeth W. Betz&rsquo;s Graphic Materials: Rules for Describing Original Items and
Historical Collections is designed to be used as a supplement to the rules contained
in AACR2 chapter 8.1 Betz&rsquo;s guide should be referred to when cataloging original
materials or those that are historical in nature. AACR2 chapter 8 is primarily
designed to cover published graphic materials of a current nature. However, its
rules provide adequately for the identification of most original material that
would be found in general libraries. See, for instance, figure 8-1, which has been
cataloged according to AACR2 chapter 8, as have all examples in this chapter of
the Handbook.2
</p>
<p>The general rules for main and added entries as given in AACR2 chapter 21
apply to graphics as they do to other types of library materials. For example, in
cataloging an original work of art, the artist is regarded as the &ldquo;author&rdquo; of the
work. Entry will be under the name of the artist (21.1A1) as shown in figure 8-1.
</p>
<p>Following the same principles of authorship responsibility, a photographic or
other photomechanical reproduction of an art work will be entered under the
name of the original artist (21.16B) (see figure 8-2).

</p>
<p>The rationale behind entry of a photographic or other photomechanical
reproduction of an art work under the original artist&rsquo;s name is the same as that
governing other facsimile reproductions also entered under the heading for the
original work. However, other forms of reproduction involving another artist&rsquo;s
intervention (e.g., a person who executes the engraving, the lithograph, etc.) con-
stitute adaptations in the same sense that a literary work rewritten in a different
literary form (e.g., a novel adapted as a play) is an adaptation (AACR2 21.10).
Thus, if an art work is adapted from one medium to another (e.g., an engraving
is made from an oil painting), such a work will be entered under the heading for
the adapter (see the examples under AACR2 21.16A).
</p>
<p>In the examples shown in figures 8-3 and 8-4, Phillipe Galle made an engrav-
ing from Pieter Bruegel&rsquo;s tempera painting Death of the Virgin. Although place-
ment of the figures is the same, it is evident that Galle&rsquo;s work is an adaptation of
the original, not a reproduction.

</p>
<p>Except for 21.16, chapter 21 does not refer specifically to graphic materials.
The basic assumption of the Paris Principles, which calls for main entry under
author or creator responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of a work when
this can be determined, holds true equally for graphic materials as it does for
books. And, as with other materials, if authorship responsibility is diffuse or inde-
terminate, main entry will be under title.
</p>
<p>8.0B1. Chief source of information. As with other types of library materials,
the chief source of information for a graphic item is the item itself. Only if the
chief source does not include necessary information will cataloging data be taken
from the container, accompanying textual material, or other sources. However, if
an item consists of a number of physical parts with individual titles in a container
that furnishes a collective title for the set, the container is to be preferred as the
chief source of information. Rule 8.0B1 instructs the cataloger to make a note
when the container is used as the chief source of information (see figure 8-5).

<p>8.4. PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION, ETC., AREA
</p>
<p>The three standard elements of the publication area (place, publisher [etc.], and
date) will be transcribed following the general rules under 1.4.
</p>
<p>8.4C2, 8.4D2. The conventional elements (place, publisher, date) of the publi-
cation area are inappropriate for the catalog entry for certain types of materials
that are, in most instances, unique items. These include manuscripts (AACR2
chapter 4), some types of realia (AACR2 chapter 10), original art works, and
unpublished photographs. For such items the publication area includes only the
date of production (see 8.4F2 and 8.4F3; see also figures 8-1, 8-3, and 8-4).
</p>
<p>8.5. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AREA
</p>
<p>Following the general pattern of 1.5, the physical description area includes three
elements, with a possible fourth if the item includes accompanying material.
</p>
<p>8.5B. Extent of item (including specific material designation)
</p>
<p>As with other types of library materials, the first element is the extent of the item
and the specific material designation. A list of terms is given under 8.5B1. These
terms are designed to describe the type of material more specifically, in many
instances, than the GMD (see 1.1C1) allows. Preceded by the number of items, one
of these terms appears as the first element of the physical description area.
Optionally, a more specific term may be used, phrased as concisely as possible.
</p>
<p>The terms defined and discussed below are among those listed as specific
material designators (see also AACR2 Appendix D [Glossary]).
</p>
<p>Art original. Generally speaking, an art original is a unique item. The GMD is
&ldquo;art original.&rdquo; The following rules specifically mention art originals: 8.5B1, 8.5C1,
8.5D4 (see figures 8-1 and 8-3 for examples of art originals).
</p>
<p>Art print. An art print is a work reproduced from a plate, a woodblock, etc.,
that has been prepared by an artist. Lithographs, etchings, engravings, woodcuts,
linoleum block prints, etc., are subsumed under this term. The GMD will be &ldquo;art
reproduction.&rdquo; It will not be &ldquo;art original,&rdquo; according to the definition of the term
given in Appendix D, unless the cataloger is cataloging the actual woodblock,
etching plate, etc.
</p>
<p>Sometimes an art print is a copy of an art original in another medium (see
figure 8-4). In other cases, the original artist and the etcher, engraver, etc., are one
and the same. In either case, main entry is under the name of the etcher, engraver,
lithographer, etc.
</p>
<p>If an art print is not commercially published, publication area data will ap-
pear as given in figure 8-4, even though the engraving may exist in a number of
copies. On the other hand, some art prints are issued by commercial publishers.
Conventional publication area data are appropriate for such an item (see the
example shown in figure 8-12). Rules that may apply are 8.5B1, 8.5C1, 8.5C2, and
8.5D4.
</p>
<p>Art reproduction. Any sort of photomechanical reproduction of an original art
work or art print is called an art reproduction. Obviously, the quality of an art
reproduction may vary according to the quality of the equipment used for the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>214 GR A P H I C MAT E R I A L S
</p>
<p>reproduction, but the end product is still regarded as being a representation of the
original. The GMD &ldquo;art reproduction&rdquo; is used for an art reproduction (see figure
8-2 for an example of an art reproduction). Most art reproductions are commer-
cially produced, as is this one; publication area will include all three of the con-
ventional elements. Some of the rules that may apply to art reproductions are
8.5B1, 8.5C1, 8.5C2, and 8.5D4.
</p>
<p>Chart. See AACR2 Appendix D (Glossary) for definition (do not confuse with
a cartographic chart). If a chart is designed with large print and illustrations in
such a way that it can successfully be interpreted at a distance, and if it is meant
to be displayed on a wall, use the specific material designation &ldquo;wall chart&rdquo; rather
than &ldquo;chart.&rdquo; The GMD &ldquo;chart&rdquo; will appear following the title proper for both
charts and wall charts (see, for example, figure 8-6). Some of the rules for charts
are 8.5B1 and 8.5D6.
</p>
<p>Filmslip. As might be guessed, a filmslip is a short filmstrip, sometimes
mounted so as to lie flat instead of being rolled, as a filmstrip generally is. The
GMD &ldquo;filmstrip&rdquo; is used for both filmslips and filmstrips. All rules for filmstrips
apply also to filmslips (e.g., 8.5B1, 8.5B2, 8.5B5, 8.5C1, 8.5C2, and 8.5D2).
</p>
<p>The chief source of information for a filmslip, as for a filmstrip, is the film
itself. Generally a title frame at the beginning and possibly a frame at the end will
furnish information. Title and statement of responsibility information should
come from either of these sources if possible. The container or accompanying
material may be used for data for other parts of the catalog entry. In the example
shown in figure 8-13, all of the cataloging information except for the location of
Encyclopaedia Britannica Films appears on the title frame of the filmslip.
</p>
<p>Filmstrip. See AACR2 Appendix D (Glossary) for definition. The GMD &ldquo;film-
strip&rdquo; is used following the title proper. The number of frames is to be added to
the specific material designation &ldquo;filmstrip&rdquo; in the physical description area (see

content frame and ending with the last content frame (8.5B2). Other special rules
for filmstrips include 8.5B1, 8.5B5, 8.5C1, 8.5C2, and 8.5D2.
</p>
<p>Flash card. See AACR2 Appendix D (Glossary) for definition. The GMD &ldquo;flash
card&rdquo; is used following the title proper. The cards themselves are the chief source
of information if they include a collective title. If not, use information on a con-
tainer or accompanying material. The container served as the chief source for the
flash cards cataloged as figure 8-5. In the example shown in figure 8-15, title infor-
mation is found on the back of each card; this source was used for transcription
of the title proper. The container furnished publication area information, the
series, and a publisher&rsquo;s number. Information about the creator and designer of
the cards was taken from the guide.
</p>
<p>Flip chart. A flip chart is a set of charts hinged at the top so that information
may be presented in a logical sequence. The GMD &ldquo;chart&rdquo; follows the title proper
(see figure 8-16). The entire flip chart is used as the chief source of information.
Special rules for flip charts are 8.5B1, 8.5B3, 8.5C1, and 8.5D1.
</p>
<p>Photograph. As with other unpublished graphic items, a complete publication
area is inappropriate to a photograph. Unless the photograph has been repro-
duced commercially for public sale or distribution, give only the date of creation
in the publication area (8.4F2). In most cases, the GMD for a photograph will be
&ldquo;picture.&rdquo; The photograph itself is the chief source of information. Unless a title
is given on the item, the cataloger will make up a brief descriptive title, bracket-
ing it in the title and statement of responsibility area. Special rules for pho-
tographs are 8.5B1, 8.5C1, 8.5C2, and 8.5D1.

<p>Picture. This term is used as the specific material designation in the physical
description area when the item cannot appropriately be called by another of the
more specific pictorial terms under 8.5B1. In addition, &ldquo;picture&rdquo; may be used to
describe a collection that is a mixture of different types of reproduction. For
example, the thirty-five presidential pictures of figure 8-11 include photographs
of more recent presidents and black-and-white reproductions of oil paintings and
drawings of earlier presidents. The term &ldquo;picture&rdquo; embraces all of these variations
and should be used. Special rules for pictures are 8.5B1, 8.5C2, and 8.5D1.

<p>Postcard. Like &ldquo;picture,&rdquo; the term &ldquo;postcard&rdquo; is a general term and may be
used as the specific material designation when a more specific one is inappropri-
ate. Although this case is not explicitly mentioned in AACR2 chapter 8, &ldquo;post-
card&rdquo; would be particularly appropriate as the designation for a collection of
items all of which are postcards but of varying content (e.g., art reproductions,
photographs, technical drawings). For particular items, 8.5B1 lists the various
specific designations and includes an option allowing the cataloger to substitute
one designation for another or to use a term of his or her own formulation if a
very specific statement is appropriate. This means that one may use &ldquo;art repro-
duction,&rdquo; &ldquo;organization chart,&rdquo; etc., in place of &ldquo;postcard&rdquo; as the specific material
designation. The GMD &ldquo;picture&rdquo; is normally used with postcards.
</p>
<p>In the example shown in figure 8-17, &ldquo;postcard&rdquo; is the most appropriate des-
ignation for the group of postcards, each of which is a photomechanical repro-
duction of sculpture. Each postcard bears the same statement on the verso:
&ldquo;Fernand Hazen, &eacute;diteur, Paris. Printed in France. Distributed in USA by Artext
Prints Inc. Westport Conn.&rdquo; The postcards have no common title; a brief descrip-
tive title appropriate to the collection has been supplied by the cataloger (8.1B2).

</p>
<p>Poster. A poster is a large sheet intended for display. A poster that contains
only printed text, or one in which text is the dominant element, is called a &ldquo;broad-
side.&rdquo; A broadside is cataloged according to AACR2 chapter 2. For an example of
broadside cataloging, see figure 2-3 and discussion.
</p>
<p>However, if the emphasis of the poster is pictorial or otherwise graphic, use
the rules in chapter 8 for cataloging. A chart, an art print, an art reproduction, etc.,
may be a poster (i.e., a large sheet intended for display). Use these more specific
material designations in preference to &ldquo;poster&rdquo; if they are applicable.
</p>
<p>Figure 8-10 is a set of graphic materials, each of which is about half pictorial
and half text. However, the chief intent of the set seems to be illustrative; there-
fore, it should be cataloged as graphic material rather than as a set of broadsides
(AACR2 chapter 2). The pictures are of different media: one photograph of an
American Indian woman; several reproductions of paintings of American Indians,
which would be called &ldquo;art reproductions&rdquo;; and engravings that are adaptations
of paintings (21.16A). Taking all factors into consideration, it seems appropriate
to use the generic term &ldquo;poster&rdquo; for the specific material designation for the set.
</p>
<p>Radiograph. The most familiar type of material subsumed under the term
&ldquo;radiograph&rdquo; is an x-ray negative. See the illustration of physical description for
a radiograph under AACR2 8.5D1.</p>

</p>
<p>Slide. A slide is a small, transparent image made of film or glass and mounted
for projection. A microscope slide is not considered to be a graphic item. Because
it usually is made up of a bit of &ldquo;realia&rdquo; sandwiched between two pieces of glass,
such a slide is categorized as realia (see AACR2 chapter 10).
</p>
<p>The chief source of information for a slide is the slide itself. In the example
shown in figure 8-18, the slides are obviously designed to be used as a unit, in
sequence, as one would use a filmstrip. Each of the four sets included in the col-
lection begins with a slide that gives title information; for example:
</p>
<p>GERMAN PAINTING
</p>
<p>OF THE
</p>
<p>TWENTIETH CENTURY
</p>
<p>Set 1
</p>
<p>In each set, the last slide has the following information:
</p>
<p>THE END
</p>
<p>Copyright 1962, by
</p>
<p>Herbert E. Budek Company Inc.
</p>
<p>If individual slides in a slide set do not provide a collective title for the entire set,
the container or material accompanying the slides may be used as the chief
source. In the slide set entitled &ldquo;West Germany&rdquo; (figure 1-17), each slide bears the
name and address of the producer and a title descriptive of the subject matter of
the particular slide. The commentary with the slide set furnished the collective
title for the set.
</p>
<p>For a further example of slide cataloging, see figure 1-111.
Stereograph. A stereograph is &ldquo;a picture composed of two superimposed
</p>
<p>stereoscopic images prepared so as to give a three-dimensional effect when
viewed with a stereoscope or with special spectacles.&rdquo;3 One type of stereograph
is the postcard-sized, opaque, double-image photograph of the late nineteenth
and early twentieth century that was designed to be viewed through Grandpa&rsquo;s
stereoscope. The modern version of the old stereoscope and its double-image
photographs is the View-Master viewer with its double-frame stereoscopic slides.
The chief source of information for this and other types of stereographic material
is the item itself, which in the case of View-Master reels usually includes a label
(see figure 8-19). Special rules for stereographs include 8.5B1, 8.5B2, 8.5B5, 8.5C2,
and 8.5D3. Do not give dimensions for stereographs (8.5D3).

<p>Study print. A study print is a graphic item that has been prepared specifically
for teaching purposes. It is generally pictorial; it may or may not include text. The
specific material designation &ldquo;study print&rdquo; rather than one of the other terms
listed under 8.5B1 should be assigned to an item or a collection of items if the term
reflects the intent of the author or creator of the material (see figure 8-20).

<p>Transparency. A transparency is a transparent image, either mounted or un-
mounted, designed for use on an overhead projector. The chief source of informa-
tion is the transparency itself. It should be used as the source for transcribing the
title and statement of responsibility. In addition, information appearing &ldquo;promi-
nently&rdquo; (i.e., on the container or accompanying material) may be given in brack-
ets as part of the statement of responsibility (1.1F1). Each of the transparencies in
the set shown in figure 8-21 bears the title &ldquo;Africa.&rdquo; The statement of responsibil-
ity is found on the accompanying material.
</p>
<p>If individual transparencies in the set do not have a common title, the con-
tainer or material accompanying the transparencies may be used as the chief
source for the entire title and statement of responsibility. Special rules for trans-
parencies include 8.5B1, 8.5B4, 8.5B5, 8.5C2, and 8.5D4. For another example of
cataloging of a transparency, see figure 1-121.

</p>
<p>Follow general instructions under 1.7. Notes are to be listed in the order in which
they appear in 8.7B. For specifics on MARC coding, see the corresponding dis-
cussion in 1.7.
</p>
<p>8.7B2. Language. Give a note on the language of the item unless it is evident
from the rest of the description (see, for example, figure 8-8, note 1).
</p>
<p>8.7B7. Edition and history. As with other notes, make this note only if the
information is not evident elsewhere in the entry. The note connects the work
being cataloged with other versions, editions, etc. (see, for example, figures 8-4, 8-7,
and 8-9). Because information about the adaptation appears in the statement of
responsibility, such a note is not necessary in figure 8-14.

<p>the container, or accompanying material (see figures 8-7, 8-8, etc.). This note is
given in a 521 field. For MARC coding and display, see discussion in this Handbook
at 1.7B14.
</p>
<p>8.7B17. Summary. Because graphic materials are often stored so that they are
difficult to browse, a summary of the content of the item is particularly useful
unless content is obvious from the rest of the entry. This note is recorded in a 520
field (see, for instance, figures 8-5, 8-8, etc.).
</p>
<p>8.7B18. Contents. See Handbook at 1.7B18 for guidance on format for contents
note (see, e.g., figures 8-8, 8-17, etc.).
</p>
<p>8.7B19. Numbers. Give important numbers that may serve to identify the
item (but not series numbers, ISBNs, or ISSNs) (see, for example, figure 8-21).
</p>
<p>8.10. ITEMS MADE UP OF SEVERAL TYPES OF MATERIAL
</p>
<p>Items consisting of various types of material, if they lack a predominant compo-
nent, take the GMD &ldquo;kit&rdquo; (North American) or &ldquo;multimedia&rdquo; (British). See dis-

<p>AACR2 chapter 9, formerly called &ldquo;Computer Files,&rdquo; contains rules for the cata-
loging of electronic resources of all types. Because such resources may contain ele-
ments of other media&mdash;for example, text, graphics, maps, music, sound&mdash;other
chapters in AACR2 may also need to be consulted.
</p>
<p>Because the technology associated with electronic resources continues to
develop so rapidly, the cataloging rules for certain parts of this section of AACR2
are subject to change. Chapter 9 was completely revised in 2001 and is likely to
undergo another major revision in the near future. In some cases the cataloger
may need to go beyond AACR2. However, the general chapter of AACR2
(chapter 1) was written with the intention of providing for the cataloging of all
media, including types not envisioned at the time of its writing. Thus, for the
most part, the basic cataloging of an electronic resource follows the general rules
used for any other type of medium.
</p>
<p>Catalogers should not be put off from attempting to catalog electronic
resources by the fact that the technology is complex and only fully understood by
computer scientists. Little more than the ability to run the program&mdash;and some-
times not even this&mdash;is required to do basic electronic resource cataloging.1
</p>
<p>9.0. GENERAL RULES
</p>
<p>Electronic resources are defined in AACR2 as data or programs, or a combination
of the two, that are either stored on a physical carrier and accessible directly (e.g.,
via a CD-ROM drive) or available by remote access (e.g., from a Local Area
Network [LAN] or via the Internet). A &ldquo;program&rdquo; is an electronic file containing
a set of instructions that tells a computer to perform certain tasks. &ldquo;Data&rdquo; com-
prise electronic information (which may be, for example, sets of numbers, blocks
of alphabetic text, or images) that is manipulated by a program. A program may

</p>
<p>stand alone (for example, a game); data always require an underlying program to
be usable. Figure 9-1 is a catalog record for a music-writing program. Figure 9-2
catalogs text data (the entire text of J.-P. Migne&rsquo;s Patrologia Latina) along with the
software program necessary to index, retrieve, and display items from the data.
Figure 9-3 shows cataloging of graphic data (a collection of maps).
</p>
<p>Electronic resources differ from most other media covered by AACR2 in that
they cannot be directly accessed by the user; an intermediate machine (computer
hardware) is required to use the resource. The multiplicity of computer systems
and hardware required to run various types of electronic resources presents a
challenge to the cataloger, who cannot be expected to have at his or her disposal
all of the possible types of machinery necessary to run or read any given elec-
tronic resource. Some account of this is taken in the rules for this chapter.
</p>
<p>Chapter 9 does not cover self-contained electronic devices such as calculators,
handheld games, etc., even though they, too, may use computer technology. Nor is

<p>system software, the basic program necessary to run the machine (as opposed to the
program being run by the machine), cataloged under chapter 9. If it is thought nec-
essary to catalog such materials, they should be described along with the device
containing them under chapter 10, &ldquo;Three-Dimensional Artefacts and Realia.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Note that the rules for main entry and other access points are the same for
electronic resources as for any other medium cataloged under AACR2, and are
found in chapter 21. Because the responsibility for electronic resources, particu-
larly databases and programs, is usually diffuse, they more often than not are
entered under title. However, if it is clear that no more than three persons have
responsibility for such a resource, main entry may be under author. Figure 9-4,
HyperMyth, is an electronic resource comprising data written entirely by Randy
Stewart; main entry is therefore under his name. On the other hand, the program
that runs HyperMyth, called HyperCard, is the product of the collaborative effort
of programmers at Apple Computer. Although a statement of responsibility
naming the chief programmer, Dan Allen, is found on the title screen, entry will
be under title with added entry for Allen (see figure 9-5).

<p>Interactive multimedia
</p>
<p>In 1994 the American Library Association published a manual titled Guidelines for
Bibliographic Description of Interactive Multimedia.2 The Guidelines, though based on
AACR2, occasionally departed from those rules in order to meet the needs of the
medium, defined as &ldquo;media residing in one or more physical carriers . . . or on com-
puter networks . . . exhibit[ing] both of these characteristics: (1) user-controlled, non-
linear navigation using computer technology; and (2) the combination of two or
more media (audio, text, graphics, images, animation, and video) that the user mani-
pulates to control the order and/or nature of the presentation&rdquo; (Guidelines, p. 1).
</p>
<p>Although the Library of Congress announced that it would apply the
Guidelines (CSB 67, winter 1995, p. 22), including the new GMD &ldquo;interactive mul-
timedia,&rdquo; the manual failed to become widely used, nor were ALA or LC suc-
cessful in having the GMD officially added to the AACR2 list at 1.1C1. LC has
since instructed its catalogers not to use the Guidelines, and OCLC has issued
similar instructions to its contributors.3 Because the cataloger may encounter
records created under the Guidelines, one example is given here, a record for the
game Myst, an electronic resource that fits the definition of interactive multime-
dia (see figure 9-6). The chief differences between this record and an equivalent

<p>cataloging is governed by chapter 9 rules for the cataloging of electronic resources
available only by remote access. Examples of catalogable resources on the Internet
include journals (see figure 9-7), World Wide Web home pages (see figure 9-8),
and text files (see figure 9-9).
</p>
<p>One important problem with Internet resources is their volatility. For example,
the publication date for figure 9-8 is known only from an earlier cataloged record
of the site. The earlier version was dated; the current version mentions no date at
all. Other aspects of the page had also changed since last viewed, most notably
the organization of the site reflected in the (optional) contents note and the URL
(Internet address). Must the cataloger of this site constantly update the record to
match its current state? Change and impermanence are problems inherent to
online resources and should be considered before a decision is made to catalog a
remote access electronic resource.

</p>
<p>9.0B. Sources of information
</p>
<p>The experience of nearly twenty-five years&rsquo; cataloging electronic resources under
AACR2 has demonstrated the difficulty of applying the AACR2 concept of chief
source of information to these materials. In most other chapters of Part I, the chief
source is determined by the carrier of the information (e.g., a printed book, a cas-
sette tape, a globe). The carrier of an electronic resource is normally diffuse: is the
carrier the server the information resides on, the network it is transmitted over,
the computer it is displayed on? Moreover, the content can be of any type&mdash;text,
sound, moving images, maps, numbers, or nearly anything else. Thus the chief
source for electronic resources is more dependent on its content than its carrier.
With these issues in mind, 9.0B was simplified considerably with the 2001 amend-
ments. The chief source of information is now defined simply as &ldquo;the resource
itself.&rdquo; This includes internal sources (title screens, menus, file headers, metadata
attached to the resource, etc.) and external sources (the physical carrier, e.g., a CD-
ROM disc surface). Information contained in these sources will likely vary; if so, the
cataloger is to choose &ldquo;the source that provides the most complete information.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In the case of figure 9-1, the disc surface and the title screen present the infor-
mation differently. Because the disc surface provides the most complete informa-
tion for the title and statement of responsibility area (it includes other title infor-
mation not found on the title screen), it is chosen as the source for that area. On
the other hand, the title screen, not the disc surface, provides the most complete
information for the edition area.
</p>
<p>Because the chief source is so loosely defined in this chapter, a note is
required identifying the source used to transcribe the title proper (see 9.7B3 and

<p>figures throughout this chapter). Note that in figure 9-1, a note has also been
given for the source of the edition statement. Where the sources of the edition
statement and title statement differ, a note explicitly stating the source of the
edition statement is required by 9.7B7. In cases where the source of the two areas
is the same, this note is not necessary.
</p>
<p>A word about title screens, a potentially useful source of information about
an electronic resource but a source that is sometimes difficult to find. Title screens
regularly used to appear when a program was opened; unfortunately for cata-
logers, this is usually no longer the case. They still exist, however. In the case of a
Macintosh electronic resource, the title screen is displayed by choosing &ldquo;About
[program name]&rdquo; under the Apple menu. The location of the title screen in a

<p>9.1. TITLE AND STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY AREA
</p>
<p>9.1B. Title proper
</p>
<p>Having chosen a source of information (see above), the cataloger is to transcribe
the title as instructed in 1.1B. One peculiarity of electronic resources is that they
may be given titles with unusual spelling or capitalization, and words are often
run together. These are to be transcribed exactly as they appear, including odd
capitalization. Do not change, for example, &ldquo;MacInTax&rdquo; to &ldquo;Mac in tax&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mac
intax&rdquo; (see figure 9-10). If it is thought that the user might attempt to look the
words up separately, give an added entry for the differing form in a 246 field (see
figures 9-4 and 9-5).

<p>throughout this chapter). If at all possible, the cataloger should attempt to at least
examine the title screen and other internal sources. These often differ markedly
from information available on external sources, both with respect to the wording
of the title proper and to the availability of statement of responsibility information.
</p>
<p>9.1C. Optional addition. General material designation
</p>
<p>AACR2 prescribes a single general material designation (GMD) for materials
covered by chapter 9: &ldquo;electronic resource&rdquo; (1.1C1). Note that this is a change
from the earlier GMD &ldquo;computer file.&rdquo; In some cases, &ldquo;kit&rdquo; may be used instead,
if appropriate (see discussion at 1.10C).
</p>
<p>9.1E&ndash;9.1F. Other title information/Statements of responsibility
</p>
<p>Like other types of media cataloged under AACR2, the source of information
chosen for an electronic resource may include, in addition to the title proper, other
title information and statements of responsibility. If so, these should be tran-
scribed as usual. Because complex electronic resources are usually the result of
collaborative efforts, they often display long lists of contributors. The cataloger
should therefore be cautious in the transcription of statements of responsibility
and limit it to major contributors, as explicitly instructed in 9.1F1.
</p>
<p>Figure 9-3 shows a manageable statement of responsibility, which will be
transcribed just as it would if it appeared on the title page of a book. The title
screen on which figure 9-11 is based shows other title information, which is tran-
scribed; it also shows statement of responsibility information. However, this

<p>information lists about two dozen persons, all of whom contributed to the
program but none of whom was responsible for the entire content. In addition,
although the rest of the title screen remains stationary, the statement of responsi-
bility scrolls in the fashion of film credits, and too quickly for the cataloger to
transcribe the information. The statement of responsibility is not transcribed.
</p>
<p>9.2. EDITION AREA
</p>
<p>9.2B. Edition statement
</p>
<p>An edition statement, if found, is to be transcribed as instructed at 1.2B. The def-
inition of &ldquo;edition&rdquo; is quite inclusive in the case of electronic resources, and
because many commercially produced electronic resources are either new ver-
sions of older resources or anticipate future versions, an edition statement will
almost always be present. Words within a statement, such as &ldquo;edition,&rdquo; &ldquo;issue,&rdquo;
&ldquo;release,&rdquo; &ldquo;level,&rdquo; &ldquo;update,&rdquo; or most commonly, &ldquo;version&rdquo; (often abbreviated to
&ldquo;v&rdquo;), are evidence that the statement is an edition statement (see, e.g., figure 9-2).
If &ldquo;version&rdquo; or a similar word has been abbreviated, the cataloger may expand the
word within brackets if it is thought that leaving it abbreviated may cause confu-
sion (see figure 9-12). Unusual statements, or a number standing alone, may also
constitute edition statements. In the latter case, a bracketed word such as &ldquo;[Version]&rdquo;
should be added (see figure 9-13).
</p>
<p>The source of an edition statement should be given in a note if it differs from
that of the title proper. This may be combined with the note giving the source of
the title proper (see figure 9-1).
</p>
<p>Be careful to distinguish between the name of the edition of the resource
being cataloged and the name of the edition of the operating system required to
run the computer. Software often includes statements such as &ldquo;runs on System
7.0&rdquo; or &ldquo;requires MS-DOS version 3.1.&rdquo; These are statements about the edition of
the operating system, not the program itself. This information is recorded in the
system requirements note (9.7B1, recorded in a 538 field), not the edition state-
ment (see discussion under 9.7B1b). On the other hand, if the statement distin-
guishes between versions written for different operating systems (e.g., Macintosh
versus Windows), this may be recorded as an edition statement (see figure 9-1).
</p>
<p>9.2C, 9.2E. Statements of responsibility relating to the
edition/Statements of responsibility relating 
to a named revision of an edition
</p>
<p>If a statement of responsibility accompanies an edition statement, transcribe it fol-
lowing space - slash - space as usual (see discussion at 1.2C and figure 9-14).
</p>
<p>9.2D. Statement relating to a named revision of an edition
</p>
<p>Treat a named revision of an edition as discussed at 1.2D. Give the name of the
edition first, followed by a comma; then give the name of the revision. Capitalize
both names. In figure 9-14, the edition is &ldquo;Macintosh version&rdquo; (the program is
available for other systems as well); the revision of this edition is &ldquo;Version 1.1.&rdquo;</p>

<p>9.3. TYPE AND EXTENT OF RESOURCE AREA
</p>
<p>This area is used to record information about the type and extent of the resource
being cataloged, specifically, whether the resource contains data, programs, or
both. The information is recorded in the 256 field of the MARC record; the only
subfield is subfield &Dagger;a (see figures throughout this chapter).
</p>
<p>The area may also contain information about the number of records, files, etc.,
contained within a resource. This information is recorded within parentheses.
Information about the number of records, etc., is only to be given if it is &ldquo;readily
available.&rdquo; Electronic resources have exhibited a tendency toward greater and
greater complexity in recent years, and because of this, this information is rarely
&ldquo;readily available.&rdquo; If it is, however, it should be recorded (see figure 9-4).
</p>
<p>It is expected that area 3 will be eliminated from chapter 9 in the 2004 update
to AACR2. The cataloger should verify this when the update is published.
Information currently recorded in this area, particularly the extent of the resource,
will be recorded in area 7, the note area (i.e., in the MARC record, information
currently coded in the 256 field will, if it is considered important, be recorded
instead in a 500 field). All figures in this edition of the Handbook reflect the rules
as they currently exist, and include area 3.

<p>9.4. PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION, ETC., AREA
</p>
<p>The publication area for published electronic resources is recorded exactly as for
any other published material (see discussion at 1.4, and 260 fields of figures
throughout this chapter). The prescribed source includes the resource itself,
including the disk or disc label; documentation issued by the publisher, including
manuals; and the container the resource came in. The cataloger may have to
consult all of these in order to find full information.
</p>
<p>9.4C2, 9.4D2, 9.4F2. If an electronic resource is unpublished, do not record a
place of publication or name of publisher. Do record the date of creation of the
resource. The definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo; is quite broad for electronic resources. If
a resource has been issued in multiple copies for distribution, it is considered
published; if it has been mounted for remote access on the Internet, it is also con-
sidered published. Unpublished items may include theses and dissertations (see
figure 1-123) and locally written electronic resources.
</p>
<p>9.5. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AREA
</p>
<p>The treatment of the physical description area for electronic resources is compli-
cated slightly by the nature of the resources being described. Electrons, bits, and
bytes do in fact have a physical reality, but they are hard for catalogers to measure
and describe, though their carrier (e.g., a CD-ROM or Zip disk) is certainly
describable. On the other hand, electronic resources that are available only by
remote access (e.g., mounted on a LAN or accessible via the Internet) do not have
any physical carrier to describe. In such cases, omit the physical description area
(see AACR2 9.5, footnote 2; for examples see figures 9-7, 9-8, and 9-9).4 If the
library possesses accompanying materials in a physical format for this type of
electronic resource, details should be given in a note (see 9.5E2).
</p>
<p>9.5B. Extent of item (including specific material designation)
</p>
<p>AACR2 9.5B1 gives six specific material designations available for describing elec-
tronic resources. A distinction is made between a computer disk, used for magnetic
storage devices (for example, a diskette) (see figure 9-10), and a computer optical
disc, used for optical storage devices (e.g., a CD-ROM) (see figure 9-2).
</p>
<p>Because the average library patron cannot be expected to be aware of the dis-
tinction between the rather arcane specific material designations given in this
chapter, a new option of using conventional terminology was introduced with the
2001 amendments. This means that terms like &ldquo;CD-ROM&rdquo; or &ldquo;DVD-ROM&rdquo; might
be used instead of &ldquo;computer optical disc,&rdquo; and &ldquo;diskette&rdquo; or &ldquo;floppy disk&rdquo; might
be used instead of &ldquo;computer disk.&rdquo; This option is likely to be popular with cata-
logers and users alike, although its use sacrifices predictability of description in
this area. The question of who decides when a particular new term becomes &ldquo;con-
ventional&rdquo; is also left unanswered. At the moment it is left up to the cataloger&rsquo;s
judgment. The Library of Congress will apply the option (LCRI 9.5B1, Aug. 2001).
Examples throughout this chapter show a variety of practices.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>EL E C T R O N I C RE S O U R C E S 239
</p>
<p>9.5C. Other physical details
</p>
<p>Following space - colon - space, record &ldquo;sd.&rdquo; if the electronic resource produces
sound and &ldquo;col.&rdquo; if it displays in more than one color (see figure 9-1). Optionally,
give the number of sides used on the disk (e.g., &ldquo;double sided&rdquo;), its recording
density (e.g., &ldquo;double density&rdquo;), and sectoring (e.g., &ldquo;soft sectored&rdquo;). The Library
of Congress will apply this option on a case-by-case basis; the National Library of
Canada will not apply the option (see LCRI 9.5C2, Dec. 11, 1989; NLCRI 9.5C2).
</p>
<p>9.5D. Dimensions
</p>
<p>The dimensions of disks, discs, cartridges, and cassettes should be given in inches
as instructed, rounding up to the nearest 1/4 inch for disks, discs, and cartridges,
and rounding up to the nearest 1/8 inch for cassettes; dimensions of reels are not
given; the dimensions of other carriers are to be given in centimeters. The most
common sizes for computer disks are 3 1/2 in. and 5 1/4 in. The most common
size for a computer optical disc (e.g., CD-ROM or DVD-ROM) is 4 3/4 in. This
measurement is of the disk or disc itself, not the envelope or cartridge it is con-
tained in.
</p>
<p>The National Library of Canada, by policy decision, will not use inches any-
where in its catalog records. Therefore, Canadian catalogers should measure the
dimensions of all types of electronic resource carriers in centimeters (NLCRI 1.5,
9.5, and 9.5D). The most common sizes for computer disks are 9 cm and 14 cm;
the most common size for a computer optical disc is 12 cm.
</p>
<p>9.5E. Accompanying material
</p>
<p>Electronic resources are frequently accompanied by manuals, command charts,
etc. The presence of such materials may be recorded here, following space - plus
- space (see figure 9-12 and discussion at 1.5).
</p>
<p>9.6. SERIES AREA
</p>
<p>As with other media, electronic resources may be published in series. For an
example, see figure 9-15. Note that the prescribed source for the series area is the
chief source of information, i.e., the resource itself. Since series information pre-
sented in different places in this resource varies in fullness (&ldquo;Facing forward
series&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Facing forward&rdquo;), the source giving the most complete informa-
tion is chosen (PDF p. 1),  following 9.0B1. Contrast this with the source chosen
for the title and statement of responsibility area: the most complete information
for the area is found on PDF p. 3. There is no equivalent for the series area to
9.2B1/9.7B7 calling for a note if the source of the edition area differs from that for
the title and statement of responsibility area. Therefore, even though in this case
the source of the series area differs from that chosen for the title and statement of
responsibility area, no special note is required.</p>

<p>9.7. NOTE AREA
</p>
<p>9.7B1. Nature and scope, system requirements, and mode of access. (a) Nature
and scope. If it is not apparent from the rest of the description, make a note about
the nature of the electronic resource. This note is recorded in a MARC 500 field
(see figures 9-8, 9-9, 9-11, and 9-15).
</p>
<p>(b) System requirements. This is probably the most important note of all, and it,
or a mode of access note, is mandatory. Because direct access electronic resources
will only operate using the computer hardware, software, and operating system
they were designed for, it is essential that the library user know what kind of
equipment is needed. Record this note in a MARC 538 field, in subfield &Dagger;a. Begin
the note with the words &ldquo;System requirements:.&rdquo; The wording may be copied
from system requirements notes, which usually are included with the documen-
tation accompanying the electronic resource, but the order of the characteristics

<p>should be that prescribed by the rule: (1) the make and model of the computer
(e.g., &ldquo;Macintosh Plus,&rdquo; &ldquo;IBM PC&rdquo;); (2) the amount of memory required; (3) the
name of the operating system (e.g., &ldquo;System 7,&rdquo; &ldquo;DOS version 3.3&rdquo;); (4) software
requirements (e.g., &ldquo;HyperCard&rdquo;); (5) required or recommended peripherals (such
as modem, printer, CD-ROM drive, etc.); and (6) required or recommended hard-
ware modifications. The cataloger should be as complete as possible in this note,
although all six elements are rarely required. If nothing beyond the model of com-
puter required is known, that is all the information that can be recorded (see
figure 9-12).
</p>
<p>If the resource is system independent, as is usual with remote access resources,
but requires a particular software other than a web browser, this is also recorded
here (see figure 9-15). (Note: although a web browser and some sort of connection
to the Internet are required to access most remote access resources, it is assumed
that this is commonly known and is not routinely recorded in a system require-
ments note.)
</p>
<p>(c) Mode of access. Resources available only by remote access should give
mode of access here. Because access to remote electronic resources is often not
dependent on the user having a particular type of hardware or system, a mode of
access note usually replaces the system requirements note for this type of elec-
tronic resource (but see figure 9-15). The appropriate MARC field is 538. The note
should be prefaced by the words &ldquo;Mode of access:.&rdquo; The mode of access note is
normally given in conjunction with an 856 field, which gives the &ldquo;address&rdquo; at
which the resource resides. Because the details will be found in the 856 field, the
mode of access note itself may be brief (see figure 9-15 and others in this chapter).
</p>
<p>The 856 field contains the information needed to locate the electronic
resource. The field has been designed so that the local system (if it is adequately
programmed) can allow the patron to go directly to the resource from the catalog
record. At the least, it should display so that the patron can copy the address and
approach the resource through a different program.
</p>
<p>856 can serve as a locator for many types of electronic resources, including
&ldquo;in-house&rdquo; resources that may reside on the library&rsquo;s LAN. Examples in this
Handbook are for electronic resources located at web sites on the Internet. For
information about other uses of the 856 field, see the latest edition of MARC 21
Format for Bibliographic Data (Washington, D.C.: Library of Congress).
</p>
<p>The first indicator in an 856 field is in nearly all cases &ldquo;4.&rdquo; The second indica-
tor identifies the relationship between the electronic resource at the location
recorded in the 856 field and the item described in the catalog record. If the record
describes the resource, the second indicator is &ldquo;0.&rdquo; If the location is for a version
of the resource (e.g., the record is for a printed book and the 856 location is for a
digital copy of the book), the second indicator is &ldquo;1.&rdquo; If the location is for a related
resource (e.g., a publisher&rsquo;s description of the book), the second indicator is &ldquo;2.&rdquo;
All 856 fields in this chapter have indicators &ldquo;40.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The URL (Uniform Resource Locator, i.e., the &ldquo;address&rdquo; of the resource) is
recorded exactly (this is critical) in subfield &Dagger;u. For an example of an 856 field, see
figure 9-15.

ming language. Programming language, if necessary, is recorded in the system

<p>9.7B3. Source of title proper. Because there are so many possible sources for
the transcription of the title for electronic resources, it is necessary to note the
source used. This is a required note (see examples throughout this chapter).
</p>
<p>9.7B6. Statements of responsibility. Make a note for any person or body not
already mentioned (e.g., in the statement of responsibility) who has a significant
degree of responsibility for the work. It is customary to give an added entry for
the publisher of software; this should be justified by a statement of responsibility
note. Often this is simply a note stating that the copyright is held by the publisher

<p>9.7B14. Audience note. Educational software is frequently geared to a spe-
cific audience level. Record this information in a MARC 521 field (see figure 9-16
and discussion in this Handbook at 1.7B14).
</p>
<p>9.7B16. Other formats. The majority of direct access electronic resources have
versions for more than one format. If this information is known to the cataloger,
it should be recorded in a note. The MARC 530 field is used (see figure 9-13).
</p>
<p>9.7B17. Summary. A brief summary of the purpose or contents of the elec-
tronic resource is often helpful to the library user. This should be recorded in a
MARC 520 field (see figures 9-1, 9-2, 9-3, etc.).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>EL E C T R O N I C RE S O U R C E S 243
</p>
<p>9.7B18. Contents. If it is possible to list the contents of an electronic resource
and there are less than about twelve parts, this may be recorded in a 505 MARC
field, each part separated by space - dash - space (see figures 9-8 and 9-9). The cat-
aloger should think twice, however, before adding contents notes to remote
access resources such as those illustrated, since they are subject to change. The
resource illustrated in figure 9-9 is not likely to change, since it is in essence a
reproduction of a printed book. That illustrated in figure 9-8, on the other hand,
is quite susceptible to change (and in fact has changed more than once during the
history of the site). In order to avoid constant maintenance, the cataloger might
be wiser to omit the contents note in this instance and instead describe the con-
tents in a summary note (520).
</p>
<p>9.7B22. Item described. A note giving the date on which the resource was
seen is required for remote access resources. This is because they change (or for
that matter, disappear) so readily. This note is usually combined with the source
of title note (see figure 9-15 and others in this chapter).
</p>
<p>9.8. STANDARD NUMBER AND TERMS OF AVAILABILITY AREA
</p>
<p>Electronic resources may have ISBNs or ISSNs. If an ISBN is found, record it in
the 020 MARC field (see figures 9-2, 9-16, and 9-17). ISSN, if found, is recorded in
the 022 field (see figure 9-7).

<p>21.29. Added Entries. GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>Electronic resources are treated no differently from any other medium with respect
to the chapter 21 rules for main and added entry. However, one type of added
entry is somewhat unique to electronic resources. The custom of giving an added
entry for the publisher has been mentioned above, at 9.7B6. This may be justified
by 21.29D, which allows added entries &ldquo;in the context of a given catalogue&rdquo; for
headings other than those prescribed in 21.30.
</p>
<p>It was once customary to make an entry for the system details in a 753 field.
The name of the make and model of the machine were entered in subfield &Dagger;a; the
operating system was recorded in subfield &Dagger;c, as for example:
</p>
<p>753 &Dagger;a Macintosh Classic &Dagger;c System 6.
</p>
<p>Because this simply repeats information already found in the system require-
ments note (538 field; see discussion in this Handbook at 9.7B1b) and there is little
justification for it as an added entry (it is not called for in AACR2, nor is it under
authority control), the Library of Congress no longer uses this field and has pro-
posed that it be made obsolete.5 Although commonly found in older electronic
resource records, it has not been used in this Handbook.
</p>
<p>21.30G. Related works
</p>
<p>Electronic resources, particularly games and educational software, may be based
on a printed book. The computer game Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is
based on the book by J. K. Rowling. Because Rowling did not write the computer
program, she is not given main entry. A name-title related work added entry is
given instead (see figure 9-18). A note is also given (see 9.7B7). See figure 9-2 for
another example of a related work added entry.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the electronic resource The Way Things Work is represented
as being by David Macaulay, also the author of the book of the same name.
Although no doubt Macaulay did not do all the programming for the disc, he is
responsible for the text and graphics and so is given main entry; because the title
in the catalog record is the same as the title of the book, no further added entry is
necessary for the related work (see figure 9-17).</p>

</p>
<p>AACR2 chapter 10 gives rules for the description of all kinds of three-dimensional
items&mdash;handmade, manufactured, and natural&mdash;with the exception of those
covered in other chapters. Globes and relief maps, for example, are cartographic
materials covered in AACR2 chapter 3.
</p>
<p>AACR2 chapter 21 has no specific rules for main and added entries for three-
dimensional objects. Thus, general principles governing authorship responsibil-
ity as set forth in AACR2 21.1A1 indicate that a sculptor will be given main entry
for his or her work (see figure 10-1).1
</p>
<p>In addition, AACR2 21.16B states that a reproduction of a work of art (e.g., a
painting, drawing, or sculpture) in the same medium as the original will be
entered under the heading for the original work. Thus, replicas of sculpture that
are intended to simulate the appearance of the original piece are entered under
the heading for the original work, whether they are the same size as the original
or not.
</p>
<p>10.0B1. Chief source of information. Descriptive cataloging conventions that
govern other types of library materials also apply to the cataloging of three-
dimensional objects. The object itself or a label permanently attached to it serves
as the chief source of information, along with any accompanying textual material
and a container issued by the &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; or manufacturer (see figure 10-2).

</p>
<p>Many of the three-dimensional items covered by AACR2 chapter 10 have more
than one part. If the individual items in the set do not bear a common title, take
cataloging information from the container. The container furnished all the infor-
mation for the example shown in figure 10-3.

</p>
<p>Record the information according to general guidelines in 1.1. In figure 10-1 the
title of the sculpture and the name of the sculptor were incised on the base of the
object. The information was transcribed accordingly. But many, if not most, non-
commercially produced three-dimensional artefacts will not be labeled in this
fashion. If no title appears on the object, a container, or accompanying textual
material, the cataloger makes up a brief descriptive title, which is transcribed
within brackets as the first part of the title and statement of responsibility area</p>

or the information appeared on one of the locations considered part of the chief
source. This information, if taken from another source, appears in a note (see
figure 10-4).

<p>10.1C. Optional addition. General material designation
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress does not use general material designations (GMDs) for
materials cataloged under chapter 10. For the sake of illustration, the examples in
this chapter depart from LC practice and use GMDs from AACR2 1.1C1, list 2.
</p>
<p>The GMD will be added immediately following the title proper. Appropriate
GMDs for materials covered by AACR2 chapter 10 include: art original, art
reproduction, diorama, game, microscope slide, model, realia, and toy. A clear-cut
distinction between &ldquo;art original&rdquo; and &ldquo;realia&rdquo; often seems difficult to make.
&ldquo;Realia&rdquo; is usually used for naturally occuring objects. For guidelines, see the def-
inition of these terms in AACR2 Appendix D (Glossary).
</p>
<p>10.4. PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION, ETC., AREA
</p>
<p>For commercially produced three-dimensional artefacts, the three elements (place,
publisher, etc., and date) prescribed by 1.4 will be included and general guide-
lines under it will be followed. However, place and name of publisher or manu-
facturer are inappropriate for a noncommercial item. Give the year of creation as
the sole element in the publication area for such objects (10.4F2) (see figure 10-4).
</p>
<p>10.4F2. Date. The date will also be omitted (and thus the entire area) when
describing a naturally occurring object (see figure 10-5).
</p>
<p>10.5. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AREA
</p>
<p>For the cataloging of three-dimensional artefacts, this area includes the same
general elements used to describe other library materials: extent of item, other
details, dimensions, and, when appropriate, accompanying material.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>TH R E E-DI M E N S I O N A L ART E FA C T S A N D RE A L I A 249
</p>
<p>10.5B1. Extent of the item. Give the number of units followed by a specific
material designation. The terms listed under 10.5B1 are not the only terms that
may be used as specific material designators in the physical description area. As
already demonstrated, everything from samplers to scorpions may be cataloged
by rules given in AACR2 chapter 10. If one of the terms listed under 10.5B1 is
appropriate to the three-dimensional object being described, use it. Otherwise,
give the name of the object as the specific material designator.
</p>
<p>Caution: although the specific material designator list may be enlarged at the
cataloger&rsquo;s discretion, this is not the case with the GMD given following the title
proper. The cataloger is limited to the terms listed in 1.1C1 for the GMD.
</p>
<p>Diorama. See AACR2 Appendix D (Glossary) for definition of a diorama. The
diorama itself is the preferred source for cataloging data. If appropriate informa-
tion is not found on the object, data may be transcribed from the container or from
accompanying material. In the example shown in figure 10-6, the title was tran-
scribed from the envelope in which the folded diorama was stored; publication
area information is from the diorama itself.

</p>
<p>Exhibit. An exhibit is &ldquo;a collection of objects and materials arranged in a
setting to convey a unified idea.&rdquo;2 An exhibit may be made up of a number of dif-
ferent types of materials; if so, the GMD will be &ldquo;kit&rdquo; (North American) or &ldquo;mul-
timedia&rdquo; (British). If the materials are unified, use an appropriate GMD from the
list under 1.1C1 (see figure 10-7). An exhibit is to be studied and observed; it is
not meant for user interaction.
</p>
<p>Game. See AACR2 Appendix D (Glossary) for definition. Unless individual
pieces in the game bear a common title, the container will be the chief source of
information. Supplement this as needed with information from accompanying
material (see figure 10-8).
</p>
<p>Microscope slide. A microscope slide is a special slide produced for use with a
microscope. It is generally made of two pieces of glass put together sandwich</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>250 TH R E E-DI M E N S I O N A L ART E FA C T S A N D RE A L I A
</p>
<p>fashion, with some realia between the layers. Cataloging information will be
taken from the slide itself, a container, or accompanying material. If none of these
sources furnishes cataloging data, the cataloger constructs an entry as has been
done with figure 1-13. Special rules governing microscope slides are 10.5C1,
10.5C2, and 10.5D1.
</p>
<p>Mock-up. See AACR2 Appendix D (Glossary) for definition. A mock-up is a
teaching device that should involve interaction with the user. Thus, a dummy
steering wheel and dashboard used to teach automobile driving is a mock-up; a
plastic piano keyboard sometimes used in teaching class piano is a mock-up
(figure 10-9).

one kind of a model, generally one with moving parts. A model may have moving
parts, but it differs from a mock-up in that it is basically noninteractive; it is
simply an artefact to be examined, not a training tool.
</p>
<p>The chief source of information for a model, as for other three-dimensional
objects, is the object itself, together with the container and accompanying textual
material (see figure 10-10).</p>

<p>A microform may be defined as &ldquo;a miniature reproduction of printed or other
graphic matter which cannot be utilized without magnification&rdquo; (see also the def-
inition in AACR2 Appendix D).1 Because a microform requires special equipment
for its use, under AACR2 rules it is regarded as a special type of library material
rather than as a variant type of book. A library collection is likely to include two
types of microforms: microform reproductions of works previously published in
eye-readable format and microforms that are original publications.
</p>
<p>Under AACR1 rule 191 (1967), a microform was to be described in terms of
the original work; that is, a microform that reproduced a monograph would be
cataloged according to monographic cataloging rules, including a physical de-
scription area, that gave the number of pages, illustration statement, and size of
the original book, if this could be determined. Microform publication details were
relegated to a note.
</p>
<p>AACR chapter 6 (1974) suggested that a microform edition of an eye-readable
work should be added to the catalog entry for the original work as a dashed-on
entry (rule 152C). This was to be done if the library owned both the original (hard
copy) edition and the microform version. If the library had only the microform,
AACR chapter 6 (1974) rule 156A stipulated treatment in the same fashion as
AACR1 rule 191. For an original edition in microform, the instructions in AACR1
191C and AACR chapter 6 (1974) 156C were identical. In this instance only, the
physical description area gave information about the microform itself.
</p>
<p>In contrast to previous rules, AACR2 chapter 11 rules for the description of
microforms are analogous to rules for the cataloging of facsimiles (1.11). In all
cases, the cataloger is to describe the microform item. Any data about the original
work (except for mathematical data of a cartographic item, 11.3A; physical pre-
sentation of music, 11.3B; or numbering of a serial, 11.3C) will be ignored in tran-
scribing information in the descriptive portion of the record. Data about the orig-
inal work are to be given in a note.

</p>
<p>The logic behind AACR2 chapter 11 is impeccable, but almost immediately on
adoption of AACR2 the Library of Congress encountered difficulty in applying
the rules of chapter 11 to microreproductions of previously published materials.
As part of its preservation program, LC made or purchased microform replace-
ments of thousands of deteriorating books in its collections each year. The
expense of creating unique bibliographic records for each of these microform ver-
sions of printed originals proved to be overwhelming, to say nothing of the fact
that library patrons, confronted with two dissimilar catalog records for the same
item&mdash;one original and one microform&mdash;were confused and dissatisfied. As a
result, the Library of Congress, the National Agricultural Library, and the National
Library of Medicine determined that they would continue to follow the AACR1
principle basing the description on the original when cataloging microforms of
previously published materials (CSB 11, winter 1981, p. 15&ndash;16; see LCRI ch. 11,
Sept. 1, 1992), although separate records for the two versions continue to be made.
</p>
<p>This decision has had enormous influence on North American cataloging
practice. The almost universal practice&mdash;based on the author&rsquo;s experience in
using the RLIN and OCLC databases&mdash;is to follow the LCRI rather than AACR2
chapter 11 when cataloging microform reproductions of previously published
materials.2
</p>
<p>If a library wishes to follow the Library of Congress policy decision in this
matter, the cataloger will catalog a microform that has previously appeared in a
different format according to the original format. In the instance of figure 11-1a,
unless the library also owns the original hard-copy thesis, the fiche must be
checked for pages and types of illustrations, and the size must be figured.3 This
information can often be obtained by consulting a database such as RLIN or
OCLC. If the size of the original publication cannot be determined, this portion of
the physical description area may be omitted. Figures 11-1a and 11-1b show cata-
loging first by LC policy decision and second according to AACR2 chapter 11.
Because a thesis is not formally published, there is no note in figure 11-1b about
the original publication.

<p>As with other types of library materials, the chief source for microforms is the

<p>A series statement pertaining to the microform will be included in the series area
(see figure 11-4). As appropriate, a series statement pertaining to the original pub-
lication will be given in a note (11.7B12) (see figure 11-2b).

</p>
<p>Notes pertaining to the microform come first. Then, as stipulated in 11.7B, give
notes relating to the original, combined in a single note. This note may be either
a 500 or a 534 note (see discussion at 1.7B7). Catalogers following the LC decision
will do the opposite, giving notes pertaining to the original in separate 5XX fields,
with a single, combined note in a 533 field giving details relating to the repro-
duction. See examples throughout this chapter for the formatting of 534 and 533
notes.
</p>
<p>11.8. STANDARD NUMBER AREA
</p>
<p>Although it seems a contradiction in terms, a microform publication sometimes
includes an International Standard Book Number (ISBN). If one appears some-
where on the item, or if the ISBN (or other standard number) pertaining to the
microform is given in any other source, it is to be transcribed as part of the entry.
Figure 11-6 is an example of an original microform publication that includes an
ISBN.

<p>2. The National Library of Australia also follows the LCRI for chapter 11 (NLARI, chapter
11). The official policy of the National Library of Canada (NLC) is to apply AACR2
chapter 11 as written (NLCRI, chapter 11), but a check of the NLC catalog shows that
this has been applied only to Canadian materials (theses and government documents).
The policy of the British Library is unclear; it has been to apply chapter 11 (correspon-
dence with the British Library dated March 26, 1996, in the author&rsquo;s possession), but
records for many such items in the British Library catalog show a confusing hybrid,
giving details for the original in the publication area, and details for the microform in
the physical description area.

<p>Chapter 12 received a major revision in 2002, as reflected in its title. No longer
called &ldquo;Serials,&rdquo; its new name is &ldquo;Continuing Resources.&rdquo; This renaming occurred
because the chapter was expanded to include more than just serials, and now
includes a newly defined category, &ldquo;integrating resources.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with AACR2 chapter 12 has been long-standing, and the
North American serials community has for some time cataloged following the
extensive rule interpretations and glosses promulgated by the CONSER program,
using the CONSER Cataloging Manual and the CONSER Editing Guide as the basis
of their work rather than working directly from the rules in AACR2.1 In 1997 a
major conference on the principles and future of the cataloging rules was held in
Toronto, and one of the more influential papers presented there was a study on
seriality by Jean Hirons and Crystal Graham.2 The Joint Steering Committee for
the Revision of AACR agreed that the serials rules needed revision, and the next
five years were spent preparing a new chapter 12 and related revisions elsewhere
in the code. At the same time work was done to make sure the new chapter was
in harmony with the standards promulgated by the International Standard Biblio-
graphic Description (ISBD) and the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN)
communities, which had themselves been changing.
</p>
<p>One of the results of thinking about revision of serials rules is that it has
become clear that all catalogers must think in terms of &ldquo;type of issuance&rdquo; when
deciding how to treat a resource to be cataloged. It may be &ldquo;finite,&rdquo; i.e., complete
(e.g., a single-volume monograph), or intended to be complete (e.g., a multipart
monograph). Or it may be &ldquo;continuing,&rdquo; i.e., issued in succession. A serial is an
example of a continuing resource.
</p>
<p>The basic unit to be cataloged is now referred to in the rules as a &ldquo;biblio-
graphic resource.&rdquo; This is defined as &ldquo;an expression or manifestation of a work or
an item that forms the basis for bibliographic description&rdquo; (see AACR2 Appendix
D [Glossary]). Continuing resources, the subject of chapter 12, are &ldquo;bibliographic
</p>
<p>CONTINUING
RESOURCES</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CO N T I N U I N G RE S O U R C E S 261
</p>
<p>resource[s] that [are] issued over time with no predetermined conclusion.&rdquo; There
are basically two types of continuing resources: serials and integrating resources.
</p>
<p>The definition of serial has been revised for 2002. It is now defined as &ldquo;a con-
tinuing resource issued in a succession of discrete parts, usually bearing number-
ing, that has no predetermined conclusion&rdquo; (AACR2 Appendix D). Serials thus
have two distinguishing characteristics: they are issued in discrete parts, i.e., their
parts can stand alone, and they have no predetermined conclusion (which is what
makes them &ldquo;continuing&rdquo;). Their parts are also &ldquo;usually&rdquo; numbered. The addi-
tion of &ldquo;usually&rdquo; was a deliberate change to the definition, which formerly re-
quired numbering, and has the effect of bringing all monographic series, whether
numbered or unnumbered, into the serials fold. Other examples of serials include
newspapers, magazines, and electronic journals.
</p>
<p>The newly defined entity, integrating resources, is &ldquo;a bibliographic resource
that is added to or changed by means of updates that do not remain discrete and
are integrated into the whole&rdquo; (AACR2 Appendix D). They are thus distinguished
from serials by the fact that new parts are not discrete but are integrated into the
original resource in such a way that the user normally cannot tell what the earlier
iteration looked like. They may or may not have a predetermined conclusion,
which means that they may be either finite or continuing resources. In spite of the
slight inconsistency this raises, rules for the treatment of either kind of integrat-
ing resource are found in chapter 12, &ldquo;Continuing Resources,&rdquo; because it is imma-
terial to the integrating resource rules whether the resource is finite or continuing.
The most common integrating resources are updating loose-leaf publications,
remote access databases, and updating web sites.3
</p>
<p>Serials
</p>
<p>The basic rules and principles governing main entry and added entries for serials
are the same as for monographs. These rules are covered in AACR2 Part II,
chapter 21. AACR2 chapter 12, as well as other chapters in Part I, deals only with
rules for descriptive cataloging.
</p>
<p>Because, as Michael Gorman has correctly pointed out, &ldquo;serials constitute a
type of publication rather than a condition of authorship,&rdquo; there is little specific
mention of serials as such in AACR2 chapter 21.4 The only specific directives are
in regard to a change in the title proper of a serial (21.2C) and to a change in the
name of the person or corporate body responsible for a serial (21.3B). However,
in view of the problems that serial publications often pose for catalogers, it seems
appropriate to give some attention to the evolution of rules for serials cataloging
that has resulted in the present rules.
</p>
<p>The ALA Cataloging Rules for Author and Title Entries (1949) included a number
of separate rules for treatment of various kinds of serials: periodicals and news-
papers were covered by 5C; almanacs, yearbooks, and similar materials by 5D;
directories by 5E; and series by 5F. As already stated, the International Conference
on Cataloguing Principles, Paris, 1961, which resulted in the Paris Principles, was
an attempt to arrive at a set of principles governing entry that would eliminate
such multiplication of rules. It is possibly significant that almost nothing was said
at the conference about serial publications as such, because the fact that a publi-
cation may be issued serially has nothing necessarily to do with the question of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>262 CO N T I N U I N G RE S O U R C E S
</p>
<p>authorship responsibility. Paris Principle 11.14 says that &ldquo;works (including serials
and periodicals) known primarily or conventionally by title rather than by the
name of the author&rdquo; should be entered under title. Paris Principle 11.5 states:
&ldquo;When a serial publication is issued successively under different titles, a main
entry should be made under each title.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Following the International Conference of 1961, the editors of AACR1 pro-
ceeded to draw up a code based on the Paris Principles. The problem of formu-
lating a rule for the entry of serials following the directive of Paris Principle 11.14
was a thorny one that troubled the editors greatly. The result of their efforts,
AACR1 rule 6, was, as Sumner Spalding admitted, rather arbitrary.5 Briefly, rule
6 divided serials into three groups:

<p>A. Those issued by commercial corporate bodies and not of personal author-
ship (to be entered under title)
</p>
<p>B. Those issued by a corporate body&mdash;be it professional, civic, or political&mdash;
that is in some way more than commercially interested in the publication
(chiefly, but not entirely, to be entered under title)
</p>
<p>C. Those by a personal author (to be entered under author).
</p>
<p>All serials in the first group (rule 6A) were to be given title main entry. But
serials in the second group (rule 6B) proved difficult to categorize. This enormous
category of serials issued by a corporate body was subdivided into two parts. The
first group (6B1) was limited to periodicals, monographic series, serially pub-
lished bibliographies, indexes, directories, biographical dictionaries, almanacs,
and yearbooks not covered by 6A and 6C. Most of the serials in this group would
also be entered under title, with added entry for the sponsoring or issuing corpo-
rate body. However, the committee felt that the wording of the serial title had to
be taken into consideration, in accordance with Paris Principle 9.12, which
directed entry under corporate body &ldquo;when the wording of the title or title page,
taken in conjunction with the nature of the work, clearly implies that the corpo-
rate body is collectively responsible for the content of the work . . . e.g., serials
whose titles consist of a generic term (Bulletin, Transactions, etc.) preceded or fol-
lowed by the name of a corporate body, and which include some account of the
activities of the body.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>It seemed too much to expect the cataloger to decide in each case whether
such serials did indeed &ldquo;include some account of the activities of the body,&rdquo; and
so a rather complex set of exceptions to 6B1&rsquo;s general premise of entry under title
evolved. Entry would be under the name of the corporate body if the title in-
cluded the name of the corporate body (Library of Congress Information Bulletin,
Journal of the Optical Society of America); or if the title included an abbreviation of
the name of the corporate body (NEA Handbook); or if the title consisted &ldquo;solely of
a generic term [such as journal, newsletter, annals, etc.] that requires the name of
the body for adequate identification of the serial&rdquo; (the American Theological
Library Association&rsquo;s publication titled Newsletter).
</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, serials covered by 6B1 were limited to periodicals,
monographic series, serially published directories, indexes, bibliographies, bio-
graphical dictionaries, almanacs, and yearbooks. Entry for any other type of serial
&ldquo;issued by or under the authority of a corporate body&rdquo; was to be under the name
of the body (6B2), without exception.</p>

</p>
<p>In accordance with Paris Principle 11.5, and in a change from ALA 1949 rule 5,
AACR1 rule 6D stipulated that serials that changed their names would be entered
separately under each title. The rationale behind this rule, which is still in effect
under AACR2 21.2C and 21.3B, was the fact that a change in the name of a serial,
even though it might not be accompanied by a change in the sponsoring organi-
zation, generally meant a shift in emphasis, a change of direction for the serial.
Such a shift often meant that the serial was in effect a new entity. Thus, under 
the general principles that governed both the Paris Principles and AACR1, the
serial should be given a new entry, even though the volume numbering might be 
continuous.
</p>
<p>In the years following publication of AACR1, serials catalogers, particularly
those concerned with machine-readable records, were increasingly unhappy with
the complexities of AACR1 rule 6. By 1975 many serials experts had rejected the
concept of entry under personal or corporate author entirely. Opposing view-
points were aired at a meeting held at the ALA Midwinter Meeting, January 19,
1975.6 Those advocating title main entry for all serials won out at the ALA
Conference of summer 1975; for several months it seemed that type of issuance
rather than authorship responsibility would be the deciding factor for serials entry
rules in the coming revision of AACR. In the midst of the turmoil over choice of
main entry, a new international code for the bibliographical description of serials,
ISBD(S): International Standard Bibliographic Description for Serials, was formulated.7
ISBD(S) was the result of the efforts of a joint working group set up by the IFLA
Committee on Cataloguing, which was responsible for ISBD(M), together with the
IFLA Committee on Serials Publication. ISBD(S) was in many respects a close par-
allel to ISBD(M) and its American counterpart, AACR chapter 6 (1974).
</p>
<p>Although the rules for cataloging of serials as set forth in AACR2 chapter 12
bore much resemblance to ISBD(S), the charge of the editors to adhere to the Paris
Principles of authorship responsibility meant that serials rules did not satisfy
those who preferred title main entry for all serials. However, as Sumner Spalding
so ably put it:
</p>
<p>If those who process incoming serial issues and those who store them
can do their work better by using the title as the means of organizing the
records and the stock of serial issues, they should do so. The present cat-
aloging rule does not prevent this. . . . So this is all the issue seems to
hang on: must we undermine a fundamental principle in our existing
cataloging system because a certain class of change in serial publications
could thereby be handled somewhat more simply? I think not.8
</p>
<p>To reiterate: when choosing the main entry for a serial, the cataloger will be
governed by the general principles given in AACR2 chapter 21. In order for main
entry to be under the name of a person, 21.1A1 states that this person must be
&ldquo;chiefly responsible for the creation of the intellectual or artistic content of a
work.&rdquo; If four or more authors are involved with the creation of a work, main
entry will be under title (21.6C2). Only rarely does a serial publication meet the
criteria for entry under personal author. The Forerunner, one of the rare examples,
is a magnificent tour de force, a substantial monthly publication containing
poetry, articles, short stories, and even advertisements, every word written by
Charlotte Perkins Gilman. But even the indefatigable Gilman ran out of steam</p>

</p>
<p>Because of the nature of a serial publication, entry under the name of a per-
sonal author is extremely rare. Choice of main entry is usually between entry
under the name of a corporate body or entry under the title of the serial. The cat-
aloger should carefully consider AACR2 21.1B2 in making this decision. If the
serial emanates from a corporate body and its predominant emphasis or purpose
falls into one of the categories of 21.1B2 (e.g., has to do with the policies, opera-
tions, resources, etc., of that body), then main entry should be under the name of
the corporate body. Otherwise, entry will be under title (21.1B3) (see more
detailed discussion in chapter 14 at 21.1B2&ndash;21.1B3; useful guidelines are also
found in CONSER Cataloging Manual, Part I, Module 4).
</p>
<p>As with other library materials, the content of the serial, not the name,
governs the choice of main entry. See, for example, figure 12-2: the GARC News-
letter emanates from the Graphic Arts Research Center. It includes material on
general developments in the graphic arts as well as announcements of Graphic
Arts Research Center activities. According to 21.1B2, entry under the name of the
center is inappropriate. Main entry will be under title with added entry under the
name of the center.
</p>
<p>In contrast to figure 12-2, the Midwest Inter-Library Center&rsquo;s Newsletter is a
work with contents dealing almost entirely with the policies, procedures, and
operations of the center. Therefore, under the provision of 21.1B2a, main entry
will be under the name of the center (see figure 12-3).
</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the basic rules governing main and added entries
for serials are the same as for other library materials. However, two rules in
AACR2 chapter 21 are addressed specifically to serials. One of these deals with a
change in the name of the person or corporate body responsible for a serial
(21.3B); the other concerns changes in the title proper of a serial (21.2C).
</p>
<p>Under earlier cataloging rules, if volume numbering of a serial was continu-
ous, the serial was considered to be a single serial despite a change in its title or</p>

<p>the name of the corporate body under which it was entered. This is not the case
under AACR2. Whether or not volume numbering is continuous, AACR2 21.2C
and 21.3B direct that a new entry be made for a serial that undergoes either a
major change in title (see 21.2A) or, if entered under corporate body, in the cor-
porate body&rsquo;s name during the course of publication. The old entry is closed off;
a new entry is started. The reason for this practice is sound. A change in the name
of a corporate body most generally is accompanied by a shift in direction, empha-
sis, or makeup of the entire body. Therefore, even if the name of the serial remains
the same and the volume numbering continues, a serial entered under such a cor-
porate body will be given a new entry for issues under the changed name.
</p>
<p>The Newsletter of the Midwest Inter-Library Center is such a serial. In 1966,
the Midwest Inter-Library Center changed its name to the Center for Research
Libraries. The entry for the Newsletter published by the center under its earlier
name was closed (see figure 12-3), and a new entry was started for issues of the
Newsletter published after the center changed its name (see figure 12-4).

<p>The cataloger should read rule 21.3B carefully. Under 21.3B, a new entry will
be made for a serial only if the main entry changes in some way. The conditions
listed are (a) the heading for the corporate body under which the serial is entered
changes; (b) the personal or corporate heading under which the serial is entered
is no longer responsible for the serial; or (c) the main entry for the serial is a
uniform title qualified by the name of a corporate body which changes or is no
longer responsible for the serial. In the example shown in figure 12-5, The Journal
of Library History, a number of changes occurred in the publisher, one of them
being a change in the name of the publisher, the other being a shift to an entirely</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CO N T I N U I N G RE S O U R C E S 267
</p>
<p>different publisher. Additionally, the place of publication changed. Because these
changes do not affect the main entry, they are handled by notes.
</p>
<p>Note, however, that the Library of Congress has added three conditions for
new entry in addition to those listed in 21.3B. These are (d) the title of a serial used
as the basis for the uniform title for a translation changes; (e) the physical format
of the serial changes (e.g., from paper to an online version, as in figures 12-6a and
12-6b); or (f) the edition statement changes in a way that indicates a change in
subject matter or physical format (LCRI 21.3B, June 2002). A new entry for the
serial will be made in all these cases, even though the title remains the same.

<p>Sometimes the title proper of a serial changes. When this happens, and the
change is a &ldquo;major change&rdquo; (see 21.2A), 21.2C stipulates that a new entry will be
made for issues under the changed title. The two serials are connected with
MARC 780 and 785 fields in a similar fashion to those used in figures 12-7 and 12-8
(see discussion of MARC coding at 12.7B7).
</p>
<p>Because AACR2 chapter 21 mandates main entry under title for many serials,
instructions are also given to solve problems created by serials entered under title
where the title proper is identical to the title proper of another serial in the
catalog. For such a serial a uniform title should be constructed (see AACR2
25.5B1). (For discussion of uniform titles, see AACR2 chapter 25 and this Hand-

<p>book, chapter 18.) This uniform title is composed of the title proper of the serial
plus a qualifier in parentheses. The Library of Congress directs its catalogers to
add the uniform title only to the serial being cataloged; the record for the earlier
serial with the same title should not be revised simply to add a uniform title (see
LCRI 25.5B, &ldquo;General,&rdquo; June 2002). A uniform title for a serial entered under title
is recorded in the 130 field.
</p>
<p>In most cases, the choice of the qualifying term is left to the cataloger. Probably
the most commonly chosen is the place of publication of the first issue. Other pos-
sibilities include corporate body, year of the first issue, or descriptive data element
(e.g., edition statement). See figure 12-9. There are many serials bearing the title
Directions, including a number published in New York. Therefore, in this case,
multiple qualifiers are needed: place of publication and date of first issue.

<p>In a few cases LCRI 25.5B prescribes the choice of qualifier. The name of the
issuing corporate body will be used for the qualifier if the title proper consists
solely of words indicating the type of publication (Bulletin, Newsletter, Journal, etc.)
and/or periodicity (Occasional Paper, Quarterly Journal, Weekly Newsletter, etc.) and
if there is another serial with the same title. Figure 12-10 is such a serial.
</p>
<p>In summary, serials cataloging presents many problems, among them the
choice of heading for main entry. AACR2 chapter 21 gives rules for main entry of
serials as well as for all types of library materials. General principles given in</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CO N T I N U I N G RE S O U R C E S 271
</p>
<p>chapter 21 will be followed, particularly noting rules 21.2C1a, changes in titles
proper of serials, and 21.3B1a, changes of persons or bodies responsible for a
serial. In addition, uniform titles will be formulated as necessary under 25.5B1 for
serials entered under title.
</p>
<p>Descriptive Cataloging for Serials
</p>
<p>Once the cataloger has decided on the proper main entry for a serial (based on
rules given in AACR2 chapter 21), the rest of the cataloging will normally be per-
formed according to the rules set forth in AACR2 chapter 12. However, when cat-
aloging a nonprint serial, the cataloger should remember to refer to the chapter
appropriate to the format for rules covering chief source of information, physical
description, etc. For example, for instructions on the prescribed sources of infor-
mation for cataloging a cassette serial (see figure 12-11), see AACR2 chapter 6,
rule 6.0B, which gives sources of information for sound recordings.

<p>often does not have access to the first issue or part. In this case, the description is
based on the earliest available issue or part. In such a situation a note must always
be added to the record explaining which issue or part was used (see AACR2
12.7B23).
</p>
<p>12.0B2a. Printed resources. The chief source of information for a printed
serial, as with a printed monograph (AACR2 chapter 2), is the title page or title
page substitute. Because a serial is meant to be issued in many parts on a contin-
uing basis, rule 12.0B1 adds that the cataloger is to use the title page (or title page
substitute) of the first issue, if possible.
</p>
<p>In the case of serials such as a yearbook, an annual report, a serially published
biographical dictionary, directory, almanac, index, etc., locating a title page poses
no problem. The piece in hand usually includes a fairly conventional-looking title
page that will serve as the chief source of information (see figure 12-12).
</p>
<p>When cataloging other types of serials, however, locating the title page may
be a problem. Generally speaking, the first issue of a serial does not include a formal
title page. The title page is generally issued separately with the last number of the
serial in the volume, if the publisher is library-minded enough to furnish a formal
title page, that is.
</p>
<p>Except for retrospective cataloging, such a title page, because it is published
later than the first issue, is not often used as the chief source. In most instances,
the cataloger will take cataloging information from a title page substitute, in this
order of preference:
</p>
<p>1. The analytical title page of the first issue of the serial
2. The cover of the first issue
</p>
<p>Title page</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CO N T I N U I N G RE S O U R C E S 273
</p>
<p>3. The caption page of the first issue (the caption is the title and other infor-
mation that appears at the head of the first page of text)
</p>
<p>4. The masthead of the first issue (this section, usually near the front of the
serial, gives details of ownership, advertising, subscription rates, etc.)
</p>
<p>5. Editorial pages
6. Colophon (a statement at the end of the item)
7. Other pages
</p>
<p>When the title proper of a print serial has been transcribed from a title page
substitute, make a note on the source of the title proper (AACR2 12.7B3) (see, for
example, figures 12-1, 12-2, etc.).
</p>
<p>Even aside from the lack of uniformity in such matters as title pages, serials
pose unique problems simply because they continue over a long period of time.
Editors change; the sponsoring body or publisher may change; even the title of
the serial itself may change. Because the catalog entry for a serial publication
describes the resource as a whole, it must show not only the original status of the
serial, but also changes that have taken place. In order to provide this informa-
tion, some modifications of the conventional patterns for monographic cataloging
are necessary. A special area&mdash;the numbering area&mdash;is included for serials (see
12.3). This area describes volume numbering and dates for the entire serial, begin-
ning with its first issue and leaving a space for information about its ultimate
demise. The serial is cataloged from the first issue; notes show later variations
such as a change in the name of the publisher or a changed subtitle. The date in
the publication area is left open for ongoing serials, as stipulated in 1.4F8, because
such a serial is a multipart item that is not yet complete.
</p>
<p>The Journal of Library History changed publishers during its existence. Its
catalog entry is shown in figure 12-5. (The record has been simplified for pur-
poses of the illustration. In fact, the journal briefly changed title in 1973, then
switched back to its original title, without, however, changing its numbering
system. The journal should therefore properly be cataloged on three separate
records under AACR2 21.2C.)
</p>
<p>12.1. TITLE AND STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY AREA
</p>
<p>For details about MARC tagging for the title and statement of responsibility area,
see 1.1.
</p>
<p>12.1B. Title proper
</p>
<p>12.1B1. Transcription of the title proper follows guidelines as given in AACR2
rule 1.1B. The title of The Journal of Library History was transcribed from the
serial&rsquo;s title page, following these guidelines (see figure 12-5). Note in 12.1B1 that,
in contrast to monograph cataloging practice, obvious typographic errors are to
be corrected when transcribing the title proper. This makes sense in the serials
context, since the record describes the serial as a whole, not an individual issue.
</p>
<p>12.1B7. In another departure from monographic practice&mdash;and for the same
reason&mdash;if a serial title includes a date, name, number, or other information that
changes from issue to issue, this information will be omitted from the title tran-</p>

<p>scription. If it occurs anywhere but at the beginning of the title, omission is indi-
cated by ellipses. However, if information occurs at the beginning of the title, it is
simply ignored (see figure 12-13).

<p>12.1E. Other title information
</p>
<p>Because publishers tend to change the wording of other title information over the
course of a serial&rsquo;s history, AACR2 stipulates that in most cases it is not to be tran-
scribed in the title and statement of responsibility area at all. The title page for The
Journal of Library History includes other title information (Philosophy and Compara-
tive Librarianship). This is not transcribed (see figure 12-5).
</p>
<p>There are three exceptions to this stipulation:
</p>
<p>1. If the title appears in the sources used for transcription both in full form
and as an acronym or initialism, choose the full form for the title proper
(12.1B2) and transcribe the acronym or initialism as other title information
(see figure 12-14).
</p>
<p>2. Transcribe other title information if a statement of responsibility is an inte-
gral part of it (i.e., cannot be transcribed as a separate statement of respon-
sibility). Figure 12-15, International Cataloguing, is an example of this. It also
illustrates a weakness in the rule, since after 1976 the wording of the other
title information changed several times. For example, vol. 11, no. 1 (Jan./
Mar. 1982) reads: &ldquo;Quarterly Bulletin of the IFLA International Office for
UBC.&rdquo; Technically speaking, the title transcription in the catalog record no
longer accurately describes these later issues.
</p>
<p>3. In cases where the title consists solely of the name of a corporate body, the
cataloger will add as other title information, in brackets, a descriptive word
or phrase in the language of the title proper.
</p>
<p>In all other cases, transcribe other title information only if it is &ldquo;considered to be
important.&rdquo; This will occur only rarely. The cataloger should consider whether
the addition of other title information would help to identify the serial. If not it</p>

<p>12.1F. Statements of responsibility
</p>
<p>12.1F1. With some exceptions, the statement of responsibility for a serial will be
recorded according to the general guidelines of AACR2 1.1F (see figure 12-13).
</p>
<p>12.1F2. As instructed in 1.1B2, transcribe the title as it appears; if it includes a
statement of responsibility or the name of a sponsoring body, etc., transcribe it
(see figure 12-16).
</p>
<p>As indicated in general rule 1.1F13 and reiterated in 12.1F2, a further state-
ment of responsibility will not be transcribed when the title includes a statement
of responsibility, unless a separate statement of responsibility appears in the chief
source of information. See discussion in this Handbook under rule 1.1F13. Con-
versely, when such a statement does appear in the chief source of information,
transcribe the information as it is found (see figure 12-17).
</p>
<p>Compare the main entries as given for The Yale University Library Gazette and
The Harvard Librarian (see figures 12-16 and 12-17). Entry is governed by AACR2
21.1B2. Examination of each serial reveals that The Harvard Librarian is devoted to
Harvard University Library matters; The Yale University Library Gazette is not.

</p>
<p>12.1F3. This rule specifies that the editor&rsquo;s name is not to be recorded as part
of the statement of responsibility in serial records. This is because most serials
have a series of editors over the life of the serial. If each editor&rsquo;s name were
included as part of the entry, the catalog record would need to be constantly
updated (see, for example, figure 12-5, The Journal of Library History. Note that the
name of the editor is not transcribed as part of the catalog record).
</p>
<p>However, if, in the cataloger&rsquo;s judgment, library users are likely to identify
the serial by the name of the editor, an added entry for editor may be made. If this
is done, the cataloger will give the editor&rsquo;s name in a note, following the guide-
lines given in 12.7B6 (see figures 12-18 and 12-19). In no instance will the cataloger
include the editor&rsquo;s name as part of the statement of responsibility.

The cataloger must exercise caution when faced with wording on a serial
</p>
<p>publication that appears to be an edition statement. 12.2B1a gives five situations
where such wording actually does indicate that a serial has been published in dif-
ferent editions. In such cases the wording is transcribed in the edition area. On the
other hand, if the edition statement on a serial publication changes with each
issue, it is to be regarded as numeric information and included in the numbering
area (see 12.2B2). For an example of such an edition statement, see figure 12-12.
</p>
<p>12.3. NUMBERING AREA
</p>
<p>The third area of descriptive cataloging for serials is used to record numerical and
chronological designations, beginning with the first issue or part and ending with
the last issue or part of the serial, whenever that issue or part appears. The num-
bering area can only be used if the first and/or last issue or part is available to the
cataloger, because the content of the area must be transcribed from those issues or
parts (see 12.3B1). (&ldquo;Available&rdquo; in this context means that either the cataloger has
actual access to the issues or parts, or has reliable information about them, i.e., an
AACR2 record cataloged by another institution which did have access to the
issues or parts.) If this information is not available, the area is omitted.
</p>
<p>This area is recorded in a 362 field in the MARC record, which can represent
either area 3 (Numbering area) or a note, depending on the coding of the indica-
tors. If it represents area 3, the first indicator is &ldquo;0,&rdquo; the second blank, and the
content is recorded according to the stipulations of 12.3 (see figures throughout

<p>this chapter). The presentation of the information in 362 fields representing area
3 is said in MARC to be in &ldquo;formatted style.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>If neither the first nor the last issue or part is available, the numbering area
cannot be used in the record. However, if the cataloger has information about the
numbering and/or dates (perhaps from a note in a later issue, or from a source
such as Union List of Serials or non-AACR2 records for the serial), AACR2 12.7B11.1
calls for a note recording this information. Confusingly, this note is also recorded
in the 362 field, although it does not represent area 3 information. When the 362
field represents a 12.7B11.1 note, the first indicator is coded &ldquo;1&rdquo; and the informa-
tion is given in the cataloger&rsquo;s own words as succinctly as possible (see figure 12-20).
This is referred to in MARC as an &ldquo;unformatted note.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>As may be seen from an examination of cataloging examples included in this
chapter of the Handbook, formatted area 3 information is given in the form in
which it appears on the item, using abbreviations as indicated in AACR2 Appen-
dix B. Capitalization is the same as for other areas: the first word is capitalized; in
addition, the cataloger will capitalize proper names and terms as given in Appen-
dix A (Capitalization). Note that although names of months in the English lan-
guage are capitalized, seasons are not (A.23). Note rules for punctuation (12.3A1).

</p>
<p>Dates following numeric or alphabetic designations are to be enclosed in paren-
theses, no matter how they appear on the publication. Detailed instructions for the
numbering area are given in the CONSER Cataloging Manual, Part I, Module 8.
</p>
<p>12.4. PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION, ETC., AREA
</p>
<p>Follow general rules as given in AACR2 1.4. For instructions in MARC tagging, see
this Handbook at 1.4. As with other elements of serials cataloging, this area is based
on the first issue or part. If in subsequent parts the place of publication or the pub-
lisher changes, no change is made to the publication area. If considered important,
information about such changes may be given in a note (see figure 12-5).
</p>
<p>12.4F. Date of publication will be the publication year as found on the first
issue of the serial. Follow the date with a hyphen as stipulated in 12.4F1. If the
serial is completed, the year of publication of the final issue should be added. In
CONSER practice the date of publication is only recorded if the first and/or last
issue is available. See CONSER Cataloging Manual, Part I, Module 10.4.2.
</p>
<p>12.5. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AREA
</p>
<p>For instructions in MARC tagging, see Handbook at 1.5. This area is currently
omitted for remote access electronic serials (cf. AACR2 9.5, footnote 2).10
</p>
<p>12.5B. Extent of the item (including specific material designation)
</p>
<p>Because the extent, like the rest of the physical description area, describes the
entire serial, the number in the specific material designation is omitted until the
serial ceases publication. At this point the number of parts should be recorded.
This number records the number of bibliographic, not physical, volumes. For example,
the serial cataloged in figure 12-10 covers five bibliographic volumes, volumes 48
to 52. The separate issues are not counted. For printed serials, use only the spe-
cific material designation &ldquo;v.&rdquo; For nonprint serials, use a specific material desig-
nation from the appropriate AACR2 chapter.
</p>
<p>12.5C. Other physical details
</p>
<p>If illustrations are a feature of most issues of the serial, the general term &ldquo;ill.&rdquo; is
usually sufficient for printed serials. See the discussion in Handbook under 2.5C. For
nonprint serials follow the instructions at .5C in the appropriate AACR2 chapter.
</p>
<p>12.5D. Dimensions
</p>
<p>See the chapter on the particular type of material (e.g., for printed serials, see
AACR2 2.5D) for directions on recording dimensions.
</p>
<p>12.5E. Accompanying material
</p>
<p>Record accompanying material only if it is issued regularly with the serial. In the
serial illustrated in figure 12-11, a pamphlet is included with each issue. Frequency
of accompanying material is indicated in a note (12.7B11).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CO N T I N U I N G RE S O U R C E S 281
</p>
<p>12.7. NOTE AREA
</p>
<p>Follow general instructions given in 1.7A concerning format and the order of
notes. Also, include any necessary notes pertinent to the specific type of library
material being cataloged. For instance, for a cassette serial (see figure 12-11), refer
to AACR2 chapter 6, rule 6.7.
</p>
<p>As a supplement to guidelines and rules in AACR2 12.7, the cataloger will
find Beverly Geer and Beatrice L. Caraway&rsquo;s Notes for Serials Cataloging (Engle-
wood, Colo.: Libraries Unlimited, 1998) to be very helpful.
</p>
<p>12.7B1. Frequency. In contradiction to AACR2, by Library of Congress and
National Library of Canada policy decision, the frequency note must always be
given, even when it duplicates information in the title (LCRI 12.7B1, June 2002;
NLCRI 12.7B1). Frequency is recorded in the 310 field; the indicators are blank,
and the statement is placed in subfield &Dagger;a (see figure 12-15). If the frequency of the
serial has changed over its history, the 310 field is used only for the latest publi-
cation frequency. Earlier frequencies are recorded in 321 fields. In this case, each
field should include the statement of frequency followed by a comma, subfield
&Dagger;b, and dates showing the time period for the stated frequency (see figure 12-11).
</p>
<p>12.7B3. Source of title proper. If the cataloger has used a title page substitute
(see 12.0B1) in the cataloging of a printed serial or, when cataloging a nonprint
serial, if the cataloger has used a source other than the chief source of information
for transcription of the serial title, a note must be given in a 500 field. The con-
ventional wording of the note is &ldquo;Title from (source).&rdquo; See examples in this
chapter.
</p>
<p>12.7B7. Statements of responsibility. If a statement of responsibility, such as
the fact that a serial is the official organ of a society or other corporate body, is not
transcribed in the title and statement of responsibility area, give it as a note (see
figure 12-21). Use the terminology found in the publication itself if possible. A
statement of responsibility note, such as that of figure 12-21, recording the name
of the issuing body, is recorded in a 550 field.
</p>
<p>For an example of the expansion of a name appearing in abbreviated form as
part of the title, see figure 12-22.
</p>
<p>A note in a 500 field is made to give the name of an editor of a serial when an
added entry is to be made for this individual (see figures 12-18 and 12-19).
</p>
<p>12.7B8. Bibliographic history and relationships with other serials. The fact
that a serial has changed its identity in any fashion is recorded in fields between
760 and 787 (known as linking fields). Depending on the system being used by
the library, these fields may trace, and they should generate notes according to the
coding of the indicators. This has the effect of linking all of the manifestations of
a serial in chronological order, as well as linking other relationships (such as edi-
tions in different languages).
</p>
<p>The 780 field is used to record the title of the immediate predecessor of the
serial being cataloged; the 785 field records its immediate successor. The coding
of the first indicator should be &ldquo;0.&rdquo; This will cause the local system to generate a
note that will be visible to the patron. (In some cases the generation of a note is
not wanted [see below]. In such cases, the first indicator is coded &ldquo;1.&rdquo;) The second
indicator depends on the note wanted. Its operation will be seen in the discussion
below of specific situations.</p>

</p>
<p>Some 12.7B8 notes are recorded in other fields. These are detailed below.
In all cases, the related serial should be recorded in the linking field in exactly
</p>
<p>the same way it would be recorded on its own record using a uniform title if one
has been formulated. For example, if it is entered under a corporate body, it
should be so recorded in the linking field (Corporate body. Uniform title); if it is
entered under [uniform] title, the linking field contains this form.
</p>
<p>12.7B8a. Continuation. Record a related previous serial in a 780 field with the
indicators coded &ldquo;00.&rdquo; This generates the note &ldquo;Continues: [name].&rdquo; The note
generated from the 780 field of figure 12-4 will appear to the patron &ldquo;Continues:
Midwest Inter-Library Center (U.S.). Newsletter.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Record a related subsequent serial in a 785 field with the indicators coded
&ldquo;00.&rdquo; This generates the note &ldquo;Continued by: [name].&rdquo; The note generated from
the 785 field of figure 12-3 will appear to the patron &ldquo;Continued by: Center for
Research Libraries (U.S.). Newsletter.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>More complex situations are handled by a combination of a 580 field and a
785 field with the indicators coded &ldquo;10.&rdquo; The second to last example in AACR2
12.7B8a would be recorded
</p>
<p>580 &Dagger;a Continued by a section in: Canadian Association of Geographers&rsquo;
newsletter. 
</p>
<p>785 10 &Dagger;t Canadian Association of Geographers&rsquo; newsletter
</p>
<p>Because of the complexity involved, the Library of Congress and the National
Library of Canada will not implement the option of dating the change (see LCRI
12.7B8a, June 2002, and NLCRI 12.7B8a).
</p>
<p>12.7B8b. Merger. Because this situation is too complex for the indicators to
generate the needed note, it is handled by a combination of a 580 field, which dis-
plays as a note, and 780 fields with indicators &ldquo;14&rdquo; (see figure 12-21).
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merged with&rdquo; is handled in exactly the same way, except the related serial
names are recorded in 785 fields with indicators &ldquo;17.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>12.7B8c. Split. When a serial is the result of a previous serial splitting into
more than one part, record this in a 780 field with indicators &ldquo;01.&rdquo; This generates
the note &ldquo;Continues in part: [name].&rdquo; The note generated from the 780 field in
figure 12-2 will display &ldquo;Continues in part: Graphic arts progress.&rdquo; The Library of
Congress and the National Library of Canada will not implement the option of
recording the names of other &ldquo;sibling&rdquo; serials resulting from the split (LCRI
12.7B8c, June 2002; NLCRI 12.7B8c).
</p>
<p>The opposite situation, recording the names of the serials a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; serial
has split into, requires a combination of 580 and 785 fields. The note for the
second example in AACR2 12.7B8c would be transcribed in a 580 field; the two
serial names would be transcribed into 785 fields with indicators &ldquo;16.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>12.7B8d. Absorption. The name of a serial that the serial being cataloged has
absorbed is recorded in the 780 field with indicators &ldquo;05.&rdquo; This generates the note
&ldquo;Absorbed: [name].&rdquo; If the information is known, the date of absorption is recorded
in subfield &Dagger;g following the name of the serial. The second example in AACR2
12.7B8d would be recorded

<p>Sometimes an introductory number of a serial will be issued to sound out the
market before the new venture is officially launched. Information about such an
introductory issue is given in a note, also in a 515 field. Cataloging will not be
done from this issue; 12.0B1 stipulates the use of the &ldquo;first&rdquo; issue (i.e., first regular
issue) (see figure 12-14).

about the beginning and/or ending dates of a publication that cannot be recorded
in the publication, distribution, etc., area or the numbering area, it should be re-
corded in a note. See discussion above under 12.3.
</p>
<p>12.7B11.2. Change in publication, distribution, etc. A note should be made
when a change occurs in the publication or distribution of a serial if considered to

</p>
<p>be important. The Library of Congress instructs its catalogers to make such a note
only if the change involves a change in country or region, or a change in the place
when the place has been used as a qualifier in a key title or uniform title (LCRI
12.7B11.2, June 2002). The note is recorded in a 550 field if the publisher is also the
issuing body (see figure 12-5), or a 500 field if the change does not involve the
issuing body.
</p>
<p>Alternately, using a new MARC technique introduced in 2001, this note can
be made by repeating the 260 field. The first 260 field represents the earliest pub-
lisher/place of publication, and contains the complete dates for the serial (if any);
its indicators are blank. The last 260 field represents the current or last publisher/
place of publication; it is coded with first indicator &ldquo;3.&rdquo; If there are more than two
publishers/places, the intervening 260 fields are inserted, in order, between these
two, and their first indicator is coded &ldquo;2.&rdquo; All the 260 fields except the first should
begin with subfield &Dagger;3, indicating the dates applicable to the publication pattern.
If this technique had been used in figure 12-5, instead of the 550 field, the follow-
ing three 260 fields would be used:
</p>
<p>260 &Dagger;a Tallahassee : &Dagger;b Library School, Florida State University, &Dagger;c1966-1987.
</p>
<p>260 2 &Dagger;3 Apr. 1968-fall 1976 &Dagger;a Tallahassee : &Dagger;b School of Library Science,
Florida State University
</p>
<p>260 3 &Dagger;3 Winter 1977-fall 1987 &Dagger;a Austin : &Dagger;b Graduate School of Library
Science, the University of Texas at Austin
</p>
<p>One of the reasons this change in the MARC format was proposed and
approved was that it made serials check-in operations easier: identification of
incoming serial titles was perceived to be clearer and more accurate if the current
publisher and place of publication was found in the field designated for publica-
tion information (260) rather than buried in a note. To date no LC or CONSER
guidelines have been issued for this technique.
</p>
<p>1.7B15. Reference to published descriptions. Although there is no specific
application mentioned in chapter 12 for the note stipulated at 1.7B15, it is very fre-
quently used in serials cataloging for noting other sources where a serial has been
indexed. Academic journals in particular are likely to be included in indexes cov-
ering many journals in a given subject area. This is very useful information to the
library user and should be recorded in 510 fields. In the serials application, the
first indicator may be coded &ldquo;0&rdquo; if the coverage of the index is unknown; &ldquo;1&rdquo; if
coverage is complete (i.e., it includes references to all articles in all issues of a
serial); or &ldquo;2&rdquo; if coverage is selective. Indicator &ldquo;0&rdquo; generates the note &ldquo;Indexed
by: [name]&rdquo;; &ldquo;1&rdquo; generates &ldquo;Indexed in its entirety by: [name]&rdquo;; &ldquo;2&rdquo; generates
&ldquo;Indexed selectively by: [name].&rdquo; The second indicator is blank. As these indexes
are typically serials themselves, they should be recorded in the same way as
linking entries for related serials (see discussion at 12.7B8). Dates of coverage are
recorded in subfield &Dagger;b; ISSN in subfield &Dagger;x.
</p>
<p>Because of space constraints (there can typically be a dozen or more individ-
ual 510 fields in the record for a popular journal), these fields are given as an
example only in figures 12-8 and 12-16.
</p>
<p>12.7B17. Indexes. In contrast to 1.7B15, which notes sources outside a serial
where the serial is indexed, 12.7B17 stipulates that the presence of indexes within</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CO N T I N U I N G RE S O U R C E S 287
</p>
<p>the serial itself should also be noted. This is done in a 555 field. With both indica-
tors blank, this field generates the note &ldquo;Indexes: [vol. no.].&rdquo; For example, the 555
field in figure 12-15 would display &ldquo;Indexes: Vols. 1 (1972)-5 (1976). 1 v.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>12.7B22. &ldquo;Issued with&rdquo; notes. If a serial is issued with (not simply bound
with) another that is cataloged separately, the record for each should record the
name of the other in a 777 field, with the first indicator &ldquo;0,&rdquo; the second blank. This
coding generates the note &ldquo;Issued with: [name].&rdquo; If a more complex note is needed,
the first indicator should be coded &ldquo;1&rdquo; and the full note given in a 580 field.
</p>
<p>12.7B23. Item described. The cataloger should make every effort to base the
bibliographic description on the first regular issue of the serial. If any other issue
must be used, a note giving the numbering of the issue used is required. It should
be given in the format prescribed in AACR2 12.7B23 in a 500 field (see figure 12-20).
</p>
<p>If more than one issue was consulted, a note is also given recording the latest
issue or part consulted in making the description. This alerts catalog users to the
currency of information in the record (see figure 12-20). The note should be used
when more than one issue is used when first cataloging the serial, or when the
record is updated based on a later issue than that originally used to construct the
description. When the serial is &ldquo;closed&rdquo; and the last issue or part is recorded in
the 362 field (based on the availability of that issue or part), the &ldquo;latest issue con-
sulted&rdquo; note is removed, since it is assumed that the last issue/part was the latest
issue consulted. For further guidance, see CONSER Cataloging Manual, Part I,
Module 8.1.2.
</p>
<p>12.8B. Standard number
</p>
<p>The International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is a number assigned by an
international network of seventy-five national ISSN centers, coordinated by a
center in Paris. It is recorded in the 022 field. Catalogers at institutions other than
the National Serials Data Program or ISSN Canada doing original cataloging of
serials leave the indicators blank if they record an ISSN (which they may find
printed on the item itself). Catalogers using copy ultimately originating from one
of these two institutions should use the coding given by them. Examples in this
Handbook have been coded blank (see figures throughout the chapter).
</p>
<p>12.8C. Key-title
</p>
<p>The key-title is a unique title assigned to a serial in conjunction with the ISSN. It
is often identical to the title proper, but may be qualified to differentiate it from
other identical titles. If found on an item or in another record for the serial, it
should be recorded in the 222 field. The first indicator is blank; the second gives
the number of nonfiling characters in order to give the system instructions to dis-
regard articles in sorting. A second field, 210, records the &ldquo;abbreviated key-title.&rdquo;
This consists of a title using abbreviated forms of the words in the key-title. The
first indicator is &ldquo;1&rdquo; if the cataloger wishes to produce an added entry for the
abbreviated key-title; otherwise it is &ldquo;0.&rdquo; Because key-title and abbreviated key-
title are assigned by an ISSN Network national center, and never by catalogers at
other institutions, only two examples are given in this Handbook, figures 12-8 and
12-12. However, these titles should always be recorded if they are known.</p>

<p>Integrating Resources
</p>
<p>As noted at the beginning of this chapter, an integrating resource is defined as &ldquo;a
bibliographic resource that is added to or changed by means of updates that do
not remain discrete and are integrated into the whole&rdquo; (AACR2 Appendix D). All
continuing resources are added to or changed over their lifetime; the important
distinguishing characteristic of integrating resources is that these additions or
changes &ldquo;do not remain discrete&rdquo; and they are &ldquo;integrated into the whole.&rdquo; In
other words, once the change has been made there is usually little or no evidence
for the previous iteration of the resource, at least for the changed part. This poses
obvious problems for cataloging.
</p>
<p>The most common types of integrating resources are updating loose-leaf pub-
lications (or other kinds of updating print resources) (see figures 12-25, 12-26, and

<p>12-27), remote access databases (see figure 12-28), and updating web sites (see
figure 12-29). Current thinking holds that direct access databases (e.g., contained
on a CD-ROM) cannot be integrating resources. If these are updated by succes-
sively issuing a new carrier, they are cataloged as serials (see LCRI 1.0, &ldquo;Situations
requiring further consideration,&rdquo; Aug. 2002).
</p>
<p>Although the rules for cataloging such resources are new to AACR2, for the
most part they do not represent new practice. For many years North American
catalogers have used Adele Hallam&rsquo;s Cataloging Rules for the Description of Looseleaf
Publications (Washington, D.C.: Library of Congress, 1989 [2nd ed.]) to catalog up-
dating loose-leaf publications, and these rules, generalized to apply to other for-
mats, were the basis of most of the additions to AACR2 for integrating resources.
Remote access integrating resources were previously cataloged under AACR2
chapter 9 (&ldquo;Electronic Resources&rdquo;); most of the rules from that chapter dealing
with integrating resources were transferred to chapter 12 with the 2002 revision.

<p>Updating loose-leaf publications consist of one or more base volumes that are
updated by the publisher, who sends subscribers new pages to be inserted or sub-
stituted for existing pages, or who sends instructions to remove obsolete pages.
The 2002 revision of AACR2 was published in an updating loose-leaf format. In
2003 a packet of replacement leaves was sold by the publisher with changes
approved by the Joint Steering Committee. Users of AACR2 were expected to
replace pages in the 2002 version with these leaves. The print version of AACR2
is now an example of an integrating resource (see figure 12-25; cataloging for this
figure is based on the 2002 iteration).
</p>
<p>However, updating loose-leaf publications are not the only type of print inte-
grating resource. Legal publications are frequently produced in large, multivol-
ume sets, which are updated by supplemental &ldquo;pocket parts&rdquo; inserted into the
back of the volumes. Once a pocket part gets too big to fit into a given bound</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>volume, an entirely new volume is issued to replace the old volume, which is dis-
carded. Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations is an example of such
an integrating resource (see figure 12-27).
</p>
<p>It should be noted here that publication in loose-leaf format does not neces-
sarily mean that the resource is an integrating resource. It is entirely possible to
publish a work in a loose-leaf binder with no intention to issue updates or
replacement pages. Such a work is cataloged as a printed monograph (or perhaps
a serial), not an integrating resource.
</p>
<p>12.0B. Sources of information
</p>
<p>12.0B1. Basis of the description. After years of AACR2 serials cataloging practice
basing much of the description on the earliest issue or part and creating a new
record if major changes occur, it is perhaps not entirely intuitive that catalogers
will base most elements of the description of integrating resources on the most
current iteration. This means that at least in theory whenever a new iteration
occurs, the record for the resource must be examined and revised if necessary. If
any changes have occurred affecting any area of the description except the date
element of area 4 (Publication, distribution, etc. area) or areas 7 or 8 (Note area,
Standard number and terms of availability area), the record must be changed to
reflect the current iteration. If this entails changing or removing information
thought to be important, it may be recorded in a note.

<p>error should be recorded in a note. The example in AACR2 12.1B1 would be
recorded as follows:
</p>
<p>246 1 &Dagger;i Title appears on v. 1, no. 1 as: &Dagger;a Housing sarts
</p>
<p>12.1B8. Change in title proper. If the title proper of an integrating resource
changes in any way, the record is changed to reflect the current iteration. Note
that the major/minor change calculation of AACR2 21.2, used to determine
whether or not to create a new serial record, has little relevance to integrating
resources: if any change occurs, the record is updated.
</p>
<p>In the MARC record, the 245 field will be revised to reflect the changed title.
The former title will be recorded in the 247 field, with the indicators normally
coded 10 (this causes the former title to index and display as a note). If the dates
when the former title was used are known, these are recorded in subfield &Dagger;f of the
247 field. The integrating resource now known as Powell on Real Property was,
until 1992, titled Law of Real Property (see figure 12-26). The title proper in the 245
field reflects the current title; the former title is recorded in the 247 field. (For
other examples of title change, see figures 1-12, 12-27, and 12-28.)
</p>
<p>12.1E. Other title information
</p>
<p>Other title information for integrating resources is treated somewhat differently
from both that of serials and that of monographs. With serials it is normally tran-
scribed only in a few defined cases; with monographs it is nearly always tran-
scribed. The rule for integrating resources essentially leaves it up to the cata-
loger&rsquo;s judgment, except in the case where other title information &ldquo;consists solely
of words relating to the currency of the contents,&rdquo; when the cataloger is instructed
not to transcribe it. In other cases other title information will usually be tran-
scribed. A factor to consider is whether the other title information is likely to
change in a future iteration. If it does change, the record must be revised to reflect
the wording of the most current iteration.
</p>
<p>12.1F. Statements of responsibility
</p>
<p>As with other title information, the recording of statements of responsibility for
integrating resources falls between the practice of serials cataloging and that of
monograph cataloging. In the particular case of editors, who are not recorded in
serial record statements of responsibility (12.1F3a), they are recorded in records
for integrating resources &ldquo;if considered to be important,&rdquo; as they usually will be.
However, as usual, if the editor (or, for that matter, anything in the statement of
responsibility) changes, the record must be revised. A note may be made record-
ing the earlier information. Patrick J. Rohan edited the resource cataloged in
figure 12-26 until June 2000, when a replacement title page was issued identify-
ing Michael Allan Wolf as the new editor. This required a revision of the record.
</p>
<p>12.2. EDITION AREA
</p>
<p>Edition statements appearing with integrating resources are transcribed in the same
manner as those for monographs, with the same caveat as for other title information</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>294 CO N T I N U I N G RE S O U R C E S
</p>
<p>and statements of responsibility for editors: &ldquo;if [they are] considered to be impor-
tant&rdquo; (12.2B1b). In most cases this information will be considered important.
</p>
<p>Changes, additions, or deletions in the wording of an edition statement in sub-
sequent iterations of the resource may signal the existence of a new resource (and
thus a new record); if not, they require revision of the record (12.2F1b). In the latter
case, if it is thought useful, the earlier edition information may be recorded in a note.
</p>
<p>The cataloging shown in figure 12-25 is based on the resource&rsquo;s first iteration
(2002). In 2003, when the library received the update packet, it should have changed
the edition statement in its catalog record to reflect the new title page wording
(&ldquo;2nd ed., 2002 revision, 2003 update&rdquo;). Similarly, the edition statement will change
again when the library receives the 2004 packet. It seems unlikely that the fact that
the title page once read only &ldquo;Second edition, 2002 revision&rdquo; will warrant a note in
the updated record. On the other hand, information about the earlier edition state-
ment of the resource cataloged in figure 12-27 does require a note in order to avoid
confusion to users of the catalog who might think that the &ldquo;Revised and permanent
edition&rdquo; was something different from the &ldquo;Permanent edition.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>As noted, a change in an edition statement may signal that a new resource is
being published, requiring a new record, and this is something the cataloger must
consider. However, figure 12-27 illustrates that such a change may not mean &ldquo;new
resource.&rdquo; The Library of Congress has given sensible guidance in this matter for
integrating resources. A change in edition statement signals a new resource (re-
quiring a new record) only
</p>
<p>1. for print resources, if the resource has been replaced entirely, e.g., with a
new base volume or set of volumes; and
</p>
<p>2. for remote access electronic resources, &ldquo;if the resource described in the
existing record continues to exist as a resource separate from the new
resource to be cataloged&rdquo; (see LCRI 21.3, June 2002).
</p>
<p>In no other case will a changed edition statement be considered evidence of a new
resource; instead, the existing record for the integrating resource will be updated
to reflect the new statement.
</p>
<p>12.3. NUMBERING AREA
</p>
<p>In most cases integrating resource records do not have a numbering area. How-
ever, the cataloger should be alert to the possibility that area 3 from another
chapter may be applicable. For example, in the case of a music integrating resource,
the Musical Presentation Statement Area might be used (AACR2 5.3).
</p>
<p>12.4. PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION, ETC., AREA
</p>
<p>If the place of publication or publisher changes on a later iteration of an integrat-
ing resource, the record is revised to reflect the most current iteration. If thought
important, information about earlier iterations can be recorded in notes. For exam-
ples, see figures 12-26 (place) and 12-27 (place and publisher). Recording this sort
of information seems less important than recording changes in (for example) titles
or edition statements, but the decision is entirely up to the cataloger.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CO N T I N U I N G RE S O U R C E S 295
</p>
<p>The date element of this area is one part of the integrating resource catalog
record that is not based on the most current iteration. Instead, the dates to be
recorded are the beginning date of publication and/or the date the resource
ceased publication (this is not usually the same as the date of the most current
iteration). Following AACR2 1.4F8, if the cataloger does not have evidence for the
first and/or last iteration, the date element is simply omitted. If this information
&ldquo;can be readily ascertained,&rdquo; give it in a note. This note is given in a MARC 362
field, with first indicator &ldquo;1&rdquo; (for &ldquo;unformatted&rdquo; note; when so coded the 362 field
does not represent the numbering area [cf. 12.3]) (see figures 1-12 and 12-28).
</p>
<p>Note that AACR2 1.4F8 is written, as is the entire code, under the assumption
that all resources are being cataloged for the first time. In fact, in most circum-
stances the cataloger begins the process by looking for cataloging copy done by
another agency for the same resource. Therefore, 1.4F8 should not be interpreted
to mean that the cataloger must in all cases have the first and/or last iteration of
the resource in hand in order to record beginning and/or ending dates in the 260
field. If the cataloger finds AACR2 catalog copy that records these dates, he or she
should accept the cataloging and not delete the information even if he or she does
not have direct evidence of it.
</p>
<p>12.5. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AREA
</p>
<p>This area is only used for nonelectronic integrating resources (the area is currently
not used for remote access electronic resources; see AACR2 9.5, footnote 2).11 For
print materials, use the specific material designation &ldquo;v.,&rdquo; qualified with &ldquo;(loose-
leaf)&rdquo; in the case of loose-leaf publications. For nonprint resources, use the appro-
priate specific material designation. In a change from previous practice, the
number of volumes or parts is not recorded until the resource is complete (i.e.,
ceases updating). Under earlier practice this element of the 300 field of figure 12-25
would have read &ldquo;1 v. (loose-leaf).&rdquo;
</p>
<p>12.7. NOTE AREA
</p>
<p>12.7B1. Frequency. Frequency of updating should be noted unless it is unknown.
This is recorded in the 310 field (see figures 12-27 and 12-28). If the updating 
frequency of an integrating resource changes, the record is revised to show the
current frequency in the 310 field; the former frequency is recorded in the 321
field. In cases where a resource has had different updating frequencies over its
existence, the dates applicable to each frequency should be recorded in subfield
&Dagger;b of the 310 or 321 field as appropriate, if known.
</p>
<p>12.7B23. Item described. Because integrating resources, by definition, change
over time, it is important that the catalog record reflect clearly which version is
being described. A note should always be made of the latest iteration consulted
when the description is made unless the description is for the first iteration. This
means that whenever a catalog record is updated to reflect a change in the
resource, this note will be updated as well. The wording of this note for nonelec-
tronic resources is usually worded &ldquo;Description based on &hellip;&rdquo; (see figures 12-26
and 12-27). This note is usually given as a &ldquo;date viewed&rdquo; note in records for
remote access electronic integrating resources, and is often combined with the</p>
<p/>

<p>&ldquo;title from&rdquo; note (see figures 12-28 and 12-29). The note is not added to records
for the first iteration of a resource (see figure 12-25).

<p>13.1. SCOPE
</p>
<p>13.1A. The scope of the process of analysis was slightly expanded and clarified in
1993. The current rule reads: &ldquo;Analysis is the process of preparing a bibliographic
record that describes a part or parts of an item for which a comprehensive entry
might be made.&rdquo; The former language, which read &ldquo;for which a comprehensive
entry has been made,&rdquo; implied that this technique could only be used if a library
had, in fact, made a comprehensive entry for the &ldquo;parent&rdquo; item. The amendment
makes it clear that analysis may be used even if the library has not made such a
comprehensive record.
</p>
<p>Both monographs and serials may be analyzed, and additional access points
for parts of the larger work may be created by means of the methods gathered in
AACR2 chapter 13. Some of these methods have already been discussed in previ-
ous chapters. All of the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; in chapter 13 are to be applied according to the
policy of the cataloging agency.
</p>
<p>13.2. ANALYTICAL ADDED ENTRIES
</p>
<p>Added entries are customarily made for parts of a work named in the title and
statement of responsibility area, which are not the title proper. Make such added
entries as name-title entries, using the authorized form of the name followed by
a uniform title or title proper, as appropriate. Note that when making such ana-
lytical (i.e., contained within the work cataloged) added name-title entries, if the
title begins with an article, the article is dropped (see, for instance, figure 1-14).1
7XX fields containing analytical entries code the second indicator &ldquo;2&rdquo; (see also
figures 1-79 and 1-86).
</p>
<p>At the discretion of the library, analytical added entries may be made for all
or some of the items listed in a contents note. If made, they will be constructed

ANALYSIS</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>under the same guidelines. The record for the book illustrated in figure 1-55
would not normally include access points for all the works contained in it. How-
ever, a library might choose to &ldquo;analyze&rdquo; the contents of the book by giving such
access points. Figure 13-1 illustrates how this would be done. It is not necessary
to analyze every work. For example, a library with a comprehensive collection of
the works of Ursula Le Guin might want to make analytic entries in records for
anthologies containing Le Guin stories, as in figure 13-2.

<p>13.3. ANALYSIS OF MONOGRAPHIC SERIES AND
MULTIPART MONOGRAPHS
</p>
<p>A monographic series is &ldquo;a group of separate items related to one another by the
fact that each item bears, in addition to its own title proper, a collective title apply-
ing to the group as a whole&rdquo; (AACR2 Appendix D, s.v. &ldquo;Series. 1&rdquo;). A mono-
graphic series is often numbered; in most instances, each monograph in the series
is cataloged independently, with the unifying title of the group listed as a series.
In other instances, the entire series is cataloged as a serial, following rules in
AACR2 chapter 12, with all, part, or none of it analyzed (i.e., given a separate
access point) depending on the decision of the cataloging agency.
</p>
<p>Library Trends is a good example of a monographic series. The set as a whole
may be cataloged as a serial. All issues will be given the same classification
number and will stand together on the library shelves (see figure 13-3). At the dis-
cretion of the library, individual volumes in a monographic series may be ana-
lyzed&mdash;that is, cataloged as an independent work. Most libraries will want to do

<p>13.4. NOTE AREA
</p>
<p>A contents note is an appropriate way to give details of parts of a monograph (see
discussion in Handbook under 1.7B18). At the discretion of the library, name-title
added entries may be made for part or all of the items included in a contents note,
following the format indicated in 13.2 (see figures 13-1 and 13-2).
</p>
<p>13.5. &ldquo;IN&rdquo; ANALYTICS
</p>
<p>Although this method was often used in the past to bring out parts of a larger
work, the Library of Congress has instructed its catalogers to use this technique
only &ldquo;in very special cases&rdquo; (LCRI 13.5, Jan. 5, 1989). As an example of one type
of cataloging where &ldquo;in&rdquo; analytics would be useful, a library that has a compre-
hensive collection on a particular author may collect everything written about
that author, including copies of articles in journals and encyclopedias. If the
library wishes to catalog these, the cataloger would base the description on the
article itself. The &ldquo;in&rdquo; note is recorded in a 773 field, with the first indicator &ldquo;0,&rdquo;
the second blank. This field generates the display &ldquo;In: [name of analyzed item--
location within the item].&rdquo; The third example in AACR2 13.5 would be coded:

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The coding of the 773 field can be quite complex. For more information, see
the latest edition of MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data (Washington, D.C.:
Cataloging Distribution Service, Library of Congress).
</p>
<p>13.6. MULTILEVEL DESCRIPTION
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress does not employ this technique of analysis (LCRI 13.6,
Jan. 5, 1989).
</p>
<p>NOTE

<p>1. General information about MARC coding is found in the introduction to this Handbook;
details about coding the descriptive portion of the record are found throughout
chapter 1; information about the coding of main and added access points is found at

in Handbook chapters 15, 17, and 18 and in Robert L. Maxwell, Maxwell&rsquo;s Guide to Au-
thority Work (Chicago: ALA, 2002). Information about specific MARC fields may be

<p>AN A LY S I S 301</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AACR2 chapter 21 gives rules for determining the main entry (the principal
heading under which a work will be entered in the library&rsquo;s catalog) and added
entries (other access points under which the work will be entered in the catalog).
The rules in chapter 21 are based on the following general principles:
</p>
<p>1. Main entry will be under the heading for the personal author chiefly
responsible for the intellectual content or the artistic creation of the work
(21.1A).
</p>
<p>2. Main entry will be under corporate body if the content of the work is
among the six types listed under 21.1B2.
</p>
<p>3. Main entry will be under title in the following instances:
a. if responsibility for intellectual or artistic content is diffuse (four or
</p>
<p>more authors) or unknown (anonymous) (21.1C1a);
b. if the work is a collection of works by different persons or bodies
</p>
<p>(21.1C1b);
c. if the work emanates from a corporate body, but is not of personal
</p>
<p>authorship and is not subsumed under the six categories listed under
21.1B2 (21.1C1c);
</p>
<p>d. if the work is regarded as sacred scripture (21.1C1d).
</p>
<p>In the context of a card catalog, &ldquo;main entry&rdquo; had reference to the &ldquo;main&rdquo; card
created for the item, which was filed at a particular place in the catalog deter-
mined by the words at the top of the card. &ldquo;Added&rdquo; entries were created by
copying the main card one or more times and typing additional access points at
the top. In view of the widespread use of online catalogs, many catalogers have
questioned the continued emphasis of AACR2 on rules for choice of main entry.
There are several reasons. Despite the general library custom of multiple entries
for most library items, many bibliographical sources, such as union catalogs,
book-trade directories, etc., cite works by a single entry. Also, a single entry is
</p>

</p>
<p>&bull;
CHOICE OF
ACCESS POINTS
(AACR2 Chapter 21)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>needed to identify a work about which something has been written (e.g., a com-
mentary on Milton&rsquo;s Paradise Lost).
</p>
<p>In addition, index displays in an online environment can be clearer when
arranged by main entry rather than title, particularly when the user is searching
for someone who performed a subsidiary function, such as an editor, translator,
or illustrator. Indexing &ldquo;hits&rdquo; in such a case by title rather than main entry im-
plies, confusingly, that the person (editor, translator, or illustrator) is the author of
the work in question.
</p>
<p>Some people nevertheless argue with considerable logic that the title of the
work should always serve as main entry, with all other points of access as added
entries. Certainly there is something to be said for that, despite the counterargu-
ment that many titles are indistinct, such as &ldquo;complete works,&rdquo; or those beginning
with the word &ldquo;journal&rdquo; or &ldquo;proceedings,&rdquo; etc. Early bibliographies in the West-
ern world were customarily arranged by title; Oriental practice calls generally for
title main entry. However, the Paris Principles, following traditional Western
library practice, are based on the concept of author responsibility. As mentioned
in the introduction to this Handbook, the Joint Steering Committee for Revision of
AACR charged the Catalog Code Revision Committee and other organizations
involved in shaping the code to adhere to the Paris Principles. The editors of
AACR2 did so, and in this respect it may be said that AACR2 continues to be a
conservative code.
</p>
<p>MARC Coding of Access Points
</p>
<p>The MARC coding of the descriptive portions of the catalog record has been dis-
cussed in previous chapters, but except for the coding of series (see Handbook at
1.6), the coding of main entry and added access points has not yet been dis-
cussed.1
</p>
<p>The main entry is coded in a 1XX field. As &ldquo;main&rdquo; entry, there is only one
such field per record. There are four types of 1XX fields:
</p>
<p>100 Personal name
110 Corporate name
111 Meeting name
130 Uniform title
</p>
<p>Added access points are recorded in 7XX fields. There may be many such
fields in a bibliographic record. The same four types exist:
</p>
<p>700 Personal name
710 Corporate name
711 Meeting name
730 Uniform title
</p>
<p>The following explanation of field coding has been kept to basic information.
There are more subfields for each MARC field than those explained here. For
further information, consult the latest edition of MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic
Data (Washington, D.C.: Cataloging Distribution Service, Library of Congress).
</p>
<p>CH O I C E O F AC C E S S PO I N T S 303</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>100 and 700 fields contain personal names, established according to AACR2
chapter 22. The first indicator is &ldquo;0&rdquo; if the name is only a forename (see figure 14-1)
or &ldquo;1&rdquo; if there is a single surname (see figure 14-2). Prior to 1996 compound sur-
names were coded first indicator &ldquo;2.&rdquo; This is no longer the case; all types of sur-
names are now coded &ldquo;1&rdquo; in the first indicator (see figure 14-3). The second indi-

<p>Uniform titles that are associated with an author may also constitute an
added access point. They are recorded either in a 240 field (when the author is in
the 1XX field) or in the title portion (subfield &Dagger;t) of an author-title added entry in
a 7XX field. The first indicator in the 240 field is coded &ldquo;0&rdquo; if the cataloger does
not want the uniform title to display, or, more normally, &ldquo;1&rdquo; if the cataloger wants
the uniform title to display (see figure 14-4). Depending on the system, this
coding can also affect whether or not the field indexes. The second indicator indi-
cates nonfiling characters. Again, code this &ldquo;0&rdquo; and drop articles from uniform
titles (the article must also be dropped in a 7XX name-title entry). Subfields for
240 fields and the title portion of 7XX name-title entries are the same as for the
130/730 field, except that the title itself in a 7XX name-title entry is recorded in
subfield &Dagger;t rather than &Dagger;a (see figure 14-8).
</p>
<p>21.0B. Sources for determining access points
</p>
<p>The most important source for determining access points&mdash;in fact, the most
important source for the transcription of the bibliographic description&mdash;is the
part of the item that may be termed &ldquo;prominent.&rdquo; For a determination of &ldquo;promi-
nence&rdquo; it is necessary to consult AACR2 0.8, where prominence is limited to the
sources prescribed for the first two areas of description (the title and statement of
responsibility area and the edition area). The prescribed sources for these two
areas vary somewhat from category to category of material (see rule designated</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>.0B2 in each chapter; e.g., for microforms, 11.0B2). In some cases these prescribed
sources may amount to the whole item. Thus, data that are prominent within an
item should furnish the necessary information to determine the main entry and
added entries. Only rarely does the cataloger need to read a book, listen to a sound
recording, or watch a motion picture to determine appropriate access points.

<p>21.0D. Optional addition. Designations of function
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress will not normally apply the option of adding a designa-
tor for function (or &ldquo;relator term&rdquo;) to added entry headings, and they will not be
used in this text.2 However, patrons of libraries do find them useful, as they indi-
cate how an entity is related to the work cataloged. They can also aid in indexing
by subdividing large files. Therefore, many libraries are now beginning to use
them despite LC practice.
</p>
<p>21.1. GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>21.1A. Works of personal authorship
</p>
<p>An author is &ldquo;the person chiefly responsible for the creation of the intellectual or
artistic content of a work.&rdquo; This includes such persons as writers of books and
composers of music, persons who prepare bibliographies, artists and photogra-
phers, and, in certain cases, cartographers. In addition, performers, in some cases,
are &ldquo;authors&rdquo; of sound recordings, films, and videorecordings (see 21.23C and
discussion of this rule in Handbook chapter 6, &ldquo;Sound Recordings&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>21.1B. Entry under corporate body
</p>
<p>The definition of a corporate body given under 21.1B1 should be read carefully.
The important thing to remember is that, for cataloging purposes, a corporate
body must (1) be an organization or group of persons (2) that has a formal name.
Rule 21.1B1 gives several criteria for deciding whether a group does indeed have
a name. The idea is not new, but the careful delineation and explication probably
have their roots in Eva Verona&rsquo;s monumental study of corporate headings, a doc-
ument that had much influence on this section of the code.3
</p>
<p>21.1B2. General rule. The general rule governing entry under corporate body
is much more restrictive than earlier codes, which simply stated that a work
should be entered &ldquo;under the person or corporate body that is the author&rdquo;
(AACR1 Rule 1A). Thus, under AACR1, many works issued by a corporate body
were entered under the body simply because the work lacked a personal author.
As Verona phrased it, &ldquo;AACR [1] avoids, as far as possible, entry under title
proper.&rdquo;4 Verona suggests a definition of corporate authorship that, although not
explicitly stated in the stipulations of 21.1B2, obviously enunciates the principle
underlying the rule:
</p>
<p>A work should be considered to be of corporate authorship if it may be
concluded by its character or nature that it is necessarily the result of the
creative and/or organizational activity of a corporate body as a whole,
and not the result of an independent creative activity of the individual(s)
who drafted it.5
</p>
<p>Following Verona&rsquo;s lead, 21.1B2 totally abandons the principle of corporate
authorship in favor of a very restrictive set of guidelines for corporate responsi-
bility under which entry will be made under the heading for the body.
</p>
<p>The cataloger must make two decisions under 21.1B2. First, does a work
&ldquo;emanate&rdquo; from a corporate body? If so, second, does the nature of the work fall
into one of the six categories listed in 21.1B2? If both of these conditions are met,
</p>
<p>310 CH O I C E O F AC C E S S PO I N T S</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the corporate body will be given main entry. Note that it makes no difference if a
personal author is involved, even as the main author of the work. If the condi-
tions of 21.1B2 are met, the corporate body receives main entry (note the ninth
and eleventh examples under AACR2 21.4B1, with clear personal authorship of
Michael Levey and John W. Hayes; main entry is still under the corporate body).
</p>
<p>A work &ldquo;emanates&rdquo; from a corporate body if the corporate body has &ldquo;issued,&rdquo;
or published, the work, or if the corporate body has caused the work to be pub-
lished, or if the work originates with the body (see AACR2 21.1B2, footnote 2;
LCRI 21.1B2, Dec. 1999). The Library of Congress gives as an example of &ldquo;origi-
nating with&rdquo; a body the case of a commercial publisher arranging with a library
to publish the library&rsquo;s catalog. Although it cannot be said that the library either
published the catalog or caused it to be published, it still &ldquo;originated with&rdquo; and
thus &ldquo;emanated&rdquo; from the library (LCRI 21.1B2, Dec. 1999).
</p>
<p>A work emanating from a corporate body will have main entry under the
heading for the body only if its content is as follows:
</p>
<p>21.1B2a. Official reports, rules and regulations, and catalogs of an institu-
tion&rsquo;s resources clearly represent the &ldquo;creative and/or organizational activity of a
corporate body as a whole.&rdquo; These are to be entered under the name of the cor-
porate body. A newsletter reporting activities of the corporate body will be
entered under the body (see figure 12-4).
</p>
<p>An annual report will be entered under corporate body (see figure 12-13). A
manual of procedure reflecting rules and regulations of a corporate body will be
entered under the name of the body (see figure 14-5).
</p>
<p>A catalog of the resources of an institution will be entered under the name of
the institution (see figure 1-18). A report of an official of a corporation, institution,
or other corporate body dealing with administrative affairs, procedures, etc., of
the corporate body will be entered under the body (see figure 14-9).
</p>
<p>To be included in this category, the work must deal with the body itself; such
works are generally published &ldquo;in the first instance&rdquo; for internal use (cf. LCRI
21.1B2a, Dec. 1999).

<p>21.1B2b. Also to be entered under the corporate body responsible for them is
a group of works that Verona calls &ldquo;primary legal acts.&rdquo; Included are laws (21.31),
treaties (21.35), and constitutions (21.33); these will be considered later in this
chapter. Also entered under corporate heading are decrees of the chief executive
(21.31) and administrative regulations (21.32).
</p>
<p>A legislative hearing is to be entered under the name of the legislative body
that has called the hearing (see figure 14-4).
</p>
<p>21.1B2c. A work that records &ldquo;the collective thought of the body&rdquo; will be en-
tered under the name of the body (see figure 14-10). Works that fall into this cate-
gory present official statements or position statements from a corporate body on
matters other than those with which the body itself deals. But the subject itself
should be related to the corporate body&rsquo;s activities. It should contain recommen-
dations for action, change, etc. If such a work simply gathers information, with-
out recommendations for action, this does not constitute the type of material that
would be entered under the name of the corporate body.

<p>21.1B2d. A work that reports &ldquo;the collective activity of a [named] conference&rdquo;
will be entered under the name of the conference (see figure 14-6). For discussion
of conferences and criteria for determining whether a conference is a named con-
ference, see 24.7.
</p>
<p>Named exhibitions, fairs, festivals, expeditions, etc., also fall into the category
of works covered by 21.1B2d. However, such events only rarely are named,
according to the cataloger&rsquo;s definition of a corporate body. One example of such
a formally named event is found in figure 14-11.
</p>
<p>For an example of a named expedition, see figure 14-12.
21.1B2d may only be applied to the three types of bodies stated in the rule

word &ldquo;prominently&rdquo; has now been removed from the rule, meaning the name can
appear anywhere in the item being cataloged and qualify for the application of
21.1B2d.

the issuing body is other than a body that is merely responsible for the publica-
tion or distribution of the materials (see figures 3-2, 3-5, 3-6, etc.).

<p>21.2. CHANGES IN TITLES PROPER
</p>
<p>21.2A. Definition
</p>
<p>The definition of title change was significantly expanded with the 2002 revision.
The definition was split into two parts defining &ldquo;major&rdquo; and &ldquo;minor&rdquo; changes,
and the list of types of changes considered minor was lengthened. Also, prior to
2002, in case of doubt the title was considered to have changed. With the 2002
revision doubtful cases are considered to be minor changes, essentially the oppo-
site of the former wording.
</p>
<p>This rule is mainly applicable to serials and monographic series, groups of
items either cataloged on a single record (series) or connected by a common title
(monographic series). If the title changes from one volume to another, at what
point is the change significant enough to require a new record for a new serial, or
a new series heading? 21.2 gives guidance.
</p>
<p>21.2C. Serials and integrating resources
</p>
<p>See chapter 12 of this Handbook for discussion and examples of proper catalog
entry for a serial with a changed title, specifically figures 12-7 and 12-8.
</p>
<p>21.3. CHANGES OF PERSONS OR BODIES RESPONSIBLE FOR A WORK
</p>
<p>21.3B. Serials and integrating resources
</p>
<p>This rule was expanded with the 2002 revision as a result of the major revision of
chapter 12. See chapter 12 of this Handbook for discussion and figures 12-3 and 12-4
for examples of a serial entered under corporate heading with a change in the
name of the corporate body.
</p>
<p>21.4. WORKS FOR WHICH A SINGLE PERSON OR CORPORATE BODY
IS RESPONSIBLE
</p>
<p>Rules 21.1 through 21.3 deal with general principles of authorship responsibility.
Rule 21.4 gives guidance for entry of a work that is the responsibility of one
person or corporate body.
</p>
<p>21.4A. Works of single personal authorship
</p>
<p>This simple rule, because it is the foundation of Western cataloging practice, may
be the most important rule in the entire code. As stated in the Paris Principles
(8.1), &ldquo;The main entry for every edition of a work ascertained to be by a single
personal author should be made under the author&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; The Paris Principles
deal only briefly with the question of determining the form of the author&rsquo;s name
that will appear as a heading in the catalog. Some authors use full legal name;
some use a nickname; some use one or more pseudonyms; and some simply are
not consistent about the form of name they use to identify their works. AACR2
chapter 22 gives rules for guidance in these problems. Basically, the heading will
be the name by which the author is commonly known. Thus, entry for a single
</p>
<p>316 CH O I C E O F AC C E S S PO I N T S</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>work by one author may appear under the person&rsquo;s real name (see figure 1-1), a
pseudonym (figure 6-2), or a word or phrase (figure 1-61). See this Handbook,
chapter 15, and AACR2 chapter 22 for further discussion and more examples.
</p>
<p>A collection or selection of works by one author will also be entered under the
name of the author, following guidelines in AACR2 chapter 22 for the form of the
heading (see figure 14-16).
</p>
<p>A work known to be by a single author will be entered under the name of that
person even if the name of the person appears nowhere in the work (see figure
14-17).

<p>21.4B. Works emanating from a single corporate body
</p>
<p>If a single corporate body is responsible for a work under stipulations of 21.1B2,
entry will be under its name (see figure 14-5, for example).
</p>
<p>21.4C. Works erroneously or fictitiously attributed 
to a person or corporate body
</p>
<p>21.4C1. The correct application of this rule assumes a fair degree of literary so-
phistication on the part of the cataloger. Normally, catalogers transcribe descrip-
tive cataloging data and assign main and added entries without questioning the
validity of information presented in prescribed sources. However, 21.4C1 stipu-
lates that if the cataloger knows that responsibility for the work being cataloged is
erroneous, or &ldquo;fictitiously attributed,&rdquo; entry will be under the name of the real
author, or under title if the real author is not known. In the examples given under
AACR2 21.4C1, because Alice B. Toklas, a real person, is known not to have written
the &ldquo;autobiography,&rdquo; main entry is under the name of the actual author, Gertrude
Stein. Because Toklas is a real person, an added entry will be given for her.
</p>
<p>As for the second example, it is well known that A. A. Milne is the author of
the children&rsquo;s classic entitled Winnie the Pooh. He never attempted to disguise his
identity by using the name Winnie the Pooh. The book entitled The Hums of Pooh
is made up of extracts from several of the books about Winnie the Pooh, a teddy
bear, written by A. A. Milne. Therefore, main entry will be under Milne&rsquo;s name.
An explanatory reference, following the pattern given below for Watson, John H.,
may be made to explain the relationship between Winnie the Pooh and Milne for
library users who may not be aware of it.
</p>
<p>The third example given under AACR2 21.4C1 is less obvious. Unless the cat-
aloger happened to be a Sherlock Holmes fan, he or she might take the title page
at its face value and give main entry to the fictitious John H. Watson. No harm
would be done; it would hardly be the first time that a cataloger has assigned a
main entry incorrectly! However, if the cataloger is alert enough to recognize the
name of Sherlock Holmes&rsquo;s sidekick and to detect the mild deception of the title
page attribution, he or she will apply 21.4C1 and give Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer the main
entry. As with Winnie the Pooh, an explanatory reference may be made to join
Watson&rsquo;s name to Farmer&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>Farmer is not the only author who has turned to Sherlock Holmes and his
friends for inspiration. The example in figure 14-2 is an imaginative reconstruc-
tion of a number of Sherlock Holmes stories, except that this time the great sleuth
solves the problems with the application of his newly discovered skill, Basic pro-
gramming language. As for the cataloging, could Sherlock Holmes have guessed
from the title page that main entry would be under the heading for Ledgard?
Perhaps not. But he might have been pleased with the explanatory reference gen-
erated by the authority record below, which not only clears up the puzzle, but
also indicates how many authors have assumed the faithful Dr. Watson&rsquo;s mantle
since the stories first appeared. The following authority record (a form of which
will display to the public) may be added to the catalog, appearing under Watson&rsquo;s
name. (For explanation of the MARC authorities format, see chapters 15, 17, and
18 of this Handbook.)

</p>
<p>21.4D. Works by heads of state, etc.
</p>
<p>The principle governing 21.4D is basically the same as that of 21.1B2: when the
head of a government speaks or writes in an official capacity, he or she represents
the office in a fashion that is clearly analogous to 21.1B2c. Therefore, entry is
under the corporate heading provided for the office that he or she holds (see 24.20
for form of heading). Such special headings are provided only for heads of govern-
ment, not for subsidiary officials. Typical of officials included in this rule would
be the queen of England, the president of the United States, the governor of
Arizona, and the mayor of Tucson (see figures 1-75 and 1-104 for examples).
</p>
<p>A collection of official communications of more than one governmental head
is entered under the general heading for the office (see figure 14-18).

<p>21.4D2. Other works. Any nonofficial communication from a person covered
by provisions of 21.4D1 will be entered under personal heading (see figure 14-19).
</p>
<p>Because such persons are entered sometimes under personal name and some-
times under the heading for their office, references are needed between the two
headings to help the bewildered patron. This is accomplished under AACR2,
somewhat confusingly, in a different manner for each heading.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.4D1, official communications entered under the head of government,
requires the cataloger to &ldquo;make an added entry under the personal heading for
the person.&rdquo; This means that each bibliographic record entered under head of
government will also include a 700 added entry field containing the head of gov-
ernment&rsquo;s personal heading (see figure 1-75). Thus, the user will retrieve the
record whether he or she searches using the official title or the personal name.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, rule 21.4D2 requires the cataloger to &ldquo;make an explana-
tory reference from the corporate heading to the personal heading.&rdquo; This means
that a record entered under the personal name of the head of government will not
also contain an added entry for the official form (see figure 14-19). Rather, the ref-
erence is achieved through the authority structure of the catalog. AACR2 calls for
an explanatory reference contained in the authority record for the official title that
will direct the patron to search both under the official title and under the personal
name (see AACR2 26.3C1), as follows:
</p>
<p>110 1 &Dagger;a United States. &Dagger;b President (2001- : Bush)
</p>
<p>663 &Dagger;a Here are entered works of the President acting in his official capacity.

<p>For reasons of economy, the Library of Congress no longer makes this type of
reference. LC catalogers now add only a &ldquo;see also&rdquo; reference to the authority
heading for the personal name:

</p>
<p>Although this type of reference is less helpful to the patron, it serves the same
purpose as the explanatory reference called for under 21.4D2.
</p>
<p>21.4D3. The provisions for entry under personal name hold true when the
work is a mixture of official and nonofficial communications. Because part of the
work consists of official communications, an added entry will be made under the
appropriate heading for the office. The example shown in figure 14-20 includes
speeches made while Lyndon B. Johnson was senator, official speeches to Con-
gress that he made as president, and miscellaneous writings.

user; title main entry is appropriate. The example shown in figure 14-21 is a book
for which the author is unknown. See figure 1-49 for an example of title main
entry for a work by an unnamed group.

<p>21.6. WORKS OF SHARED RESPONSIBILITY
</p>
<p>Rule 21.6 gives direction about main entry for works produced by two or more
authors, whether these authors worked as collaborators in a work of joint author-
ship or as contributors to a composite work (a work in which each author&rsquo;s con-
tribution is separate and distinct) as long as such a work has a title applicable to
the entire work. Paris Principle 10 (&ldquo;Multiple authorship&rdquo;) governs the rule insofar
as personal authors are involved: main entry will be under the name of the person
primarily responsible for the intellectual or artistic creation of the work, if this
primary responsibility can be determined. If primary responsibility cannot be
determined, main entry will be under the heading for the author named first in
the prescribed source of information or, if the source lists four or more authors,
under title.
</p>
<p>In addition to works of personal authorship, rule 21.6 covers entry of works
emanating from more than one corporate body if such works are covered by the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>categories listed under 21.1B2. Also covered are &ldquo;works resulting from a collabo-
ration or exchange between a person and a corporate body.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Not covered are collections of previously existing works. These are treated
under 21.7.
</p>
<p>21.6B. Principal responsibility indicated
</p>
<p>This rule is closely related to 21.6C; the only instance in which the stipulations of
this rule would result in an entry different from that called for under 21.6C is if
the layout (type, etc.) of the chief source indicates that a person other than the one
named first is principally responsible for the work. Only rarely is a chief source
set up in such a fashion. A straightforward and obvious example of the rule is
shown in figure 14-24.

<p>21.6C. Principal responsibility not indicated
</p>
<p>If the chief source of information does not indicate which author has principal
responsibility for the work, give main entry to the first author named if the chief
source lists either two or three authors. Give added entries to the author or
authors not receiving main entry. Figure 1-3 is an example of this rule.
</p>
<p>21.6C2. If the chief source of information lists four or more persons or corpo-
rate bodies, none of which has the principal responsibility for the work, make a
title main entry. The rationale for this rule is that the user of the catalog in think-
ing of a book with four or more authors is more likely to remember it by title than
by author (i.e., authorship is diffuse). The choice of cutoff point for main entry
under author at three authors follows Paris Principle 10.22. Figure 1-33 is an
example of this rule, as is figure 1-35. The former shows entry for a work for
which four corporate bodies had responsibility.</p>

<p>21.7. COLLECTIONS OF WORKS BY DIFFERENT PERSONS OR BODIES
</p>
<p>21.7B. Item with collective title
</p>
<p>A collection of independent works by two or more different persons or bodies
(21.7A1a) having a collective title will be entered under its title. An encyclopedic dic-
tionary is a familiar type of such a work (see figure 14-26). Figure 14-27 is an example
of 21.7A1b, a collection of extracts from independent works by different persons.
</p>
<p>Added entries will be made for compilers or editors if not more than three are
named prominently (i.e., in the prescribed sources for transcription of the title
and statement of responsibility, or for the edition area). Figure 1-33 is an example
of a work with a prominently named editor.
</p>
<p>If more than three editors or compilers are named prominently in a work with
a collective title, only the first named (or the principal) editor&rsquo;s or compiler&rsquo;s
name is transcribed in the statement of responsibility; added entry will be given
to that person only (see figure 14-28).
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;collection&rdquo; may have as few as two works by different authors and still be
a collection under the terms of 21.7. If a collection has two or three items in it,
enter under title and make name-title added entries for each (see figures 14-8 and
14-29 for examples of such collections). Note that the title in a name-title added
entry is the uniform title, not necessarily the title as found in the item. A patron
searching under the English title of one of the works collected in figure 14-29 may
be directed to the correct form by means of a &ldquo;search under&rdquo; reference generated
by the authority record for the uniform title (cf. also LCRI 21.30M, &ldquo;Analytical
entries,&rdquo; &sect;4, Nov. 10, 1993). Additionally, as in figure 14-29, the cataloger may
make title added entries through the 740 field for &ldquo;uncontrolled&rdquo; forms of titles.</p>

<p>Sometimes a collection includes more than three separate items but these
items are by either two or three contributors. If a contributor is responsible for only
one of the items, make a name-title added entry for that item. For contributors who
are responsible for more than one item, make added entries under the headings for
their names. See the example A Cornish quintette under AACR2 21.7B1.
</p>
<p>Ordinarily, if there are more than three contributors, no added entry is given
to any of the names. But if the names of the contributors are listed in the chief
source, the first contributor&rsquo;s name will be transcribed as part of the statement of
responsibility; this person will be given an added entry (see figure 14-30). Further-
more, under AACR2 chapter 13 (&ldquo;Analysis&rdquo;), a library may, according to its own
policy, give name-title added entries to any or all contributors, beyond those
called for in 21.7B (see AACR2 13.2).

<p>For an example of main entry and added entry for an item without a collective
title, see figure 1-56a. A name-title added entry is to be made for the second work
in the item; entry is under the author of the first item.

<p>other types of material), see LCRI 21.7B and 21.7C (May 19, 1994) and chapter 6
of this Handbook.
</p>
<p>Works of Mixed Responsibility
</p>
<p>21.8A. Scope
</p>
<p>Rules 21.1 through 21.7 cover works for which one or more persons or corporate
bodies are responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of the item and have
performed the same function, either as collaborators or as individuals working on
separate parts of the item. Rules 21.8 through 21.27 deal with works in which dif-
ferent persons or corporate bodies have performed different kinds of functions on
the same work: for example, one person has written a work; another has revised,
adapted, illustrated, or translated it, or has acted in some other capacity. The Paris
Principles do not address themselves specifically to the problem of determining
which of these several individuals or corporate bodies is actually principally
responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of the work. Rules 21.8 through
21.27 give guidance so that the principle of authorship responsibility may be
maintained even when responsibility is mixed.
</p>
<p>Rules are divided into two types of mixed responsibility: (1) modifications of
previously existing works and (2) new works to which different types of contri-
butions have been made.
</p>
<p>Works That Are Modifications of Other Works
</p>
<p>21.9. GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>If a work has been rewritten or if the medium has been changed (i.e., a book made
into a motion picture), in most cases the resulting product is regarded as a new
work although the original author&rsquo;s ideas and even some of his or her words may
have been kept. As such, it will be entered under the heading appropriate for the
new work, with name-title added entry for the original work. Figure 1-90 is one
example of a literary adaptation in which a story, retold by the adapter, is entered
under the name of the adapter. The motion picture adaptation of Alice in Wonder-
land (figure 7-5) is an example of a motion picture made from a book, the motion
picture clearly a new work.
</p>
<p>However, a sound recording made from a book&mdash;as long as the original
author&rsquo;s words are retained&mdash;will be entered under the heading appropriate to
the original work (see AACR2 21.23A1 and figure 6-2). Likewise, an updating,
abridgment, revision, rearrangement, etc., will be entered in the same fashion as
the original work as long as the original author (creator, etc.) is named in a state-
ment of responsibility (for example, see figure 1-41; see also AACR2 21.12A).
</p>
<p>Modifications of Texts
</p>
<p>21.10. ADAPTATIONS OF TEXTS

<p>21.11. ILLUSTRATED TEXTS
</p>
<p>An illustrated work is one in which the text was written first and illustrated later.
The author of the text is primarily responsible for the work; entry will be under
name of the author. See 21.30K2 for guidance in the matter of added entry under
the name of the illustrator. In the example shown in figure 14-33, added entry will
be made for the illustrator because, as is the case with many books for children,
illustrations occupy about half of the book and are an important feature of the
work (see also figures 1-65 and 1-109). Illustrations are also usually &ldquo;considered
to be an important feature of the work&rdquo; (21.30K2c) in modern fine press books
(see, e.g., figures 1-20 and 2-6). Compare this rule with AACR2 21.24, works of

<p>The artist is chiefly responsible for the content of a work consisting solely of illus-
trations. Under the principle of author (creator, artist, etc.) responsibility as defined
in 21.1A1, main entry will be under the name of the artist (see figure 1-27).
</p>
<p>An important example of this type of work is a reproduction of part of a
medieval psalter or book of hours. Such a reproduction often emphasizes the
illustrative material. By LCRI 21.11B (Feb. 1, 1989), the cataloger is to enter these
incomplete psalters, etc., under the heading for the artist, or under title if the artist
is unknown. Make an added entry for the heading for the original work (see
figure 14-34).</p>

<p>21.12. REVISIONS OF TEXTS
</p>
<p>Rule 21.12 deals with works that have been revised, enlarged, abridged, con-
densed, etc., but for which the text remains substantially in the words of the orig-
inal author. The cataloger is not obliged to compare editions to determine
whether or not that is the case; the wording of the title page will be the deciding
factor in the choice of main entry.
</p>
<p>21.12A. Original author considered responsible
</p>
<p>Main entry will be under the heading for the original author of a revised work
only if the original author&rsquo;s name appears in the statement of responsibility of the
work. The only exception is if the original author&rsquo;s name appears in the title
proper and &ldquo;no other person is named in a statement of responsibility or other
title information.&rdquo; In figure 1-59 the original author&rsquo;s name appears in the state-
ment of responsibility. Main entry will therefore be under this author&rsquo;s name.
</p>
<p>21.12B. Original author no longer considered responsible
</p>
<p>If, in contrast to 21.12A, the original author&rsquo;s name no longer appears on the title
page or other chief source of information, or if the original author&rsquo;s name appears</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>only in the title proper &ldquo;and some other person or body is named as being pri-
marily responsible in the statement of responsibility or in the statement of respon-
sibility relating to the edition,&rdquo; main entry will be under the name of the reviser,
with a name-title added entry under the heading for the original author (see
figure 1-60). Note that under the original AACR2 (1978) this record would have
had main entry under James Wilson Bright (see also figure 1-100).
</p>
<p>21.13. TEXTS PUBLISHED WITH COMMENTARY
</p>
<p>21.13A. Scope
</p>
<p>This rule applies only to publications consisting of a work or group of works by
a single author (personal or corporate) together with commentary on it by
someone else. Use this rule only when both text and commentary are present.
</p>
<p>21.13B. Commentary emphasized
</p>
<p>If title page wording indicates that the publication is a commentary, enter it under
the appropriate heading for the commentary according to 21.1A or 21.1B. In the
example shown in figure 14-35, the commentary emanates from a corporate body,
the Canon Law Society of America. The publication is one of the types listed
under 21.1B2 (21.1B2c). Therefore, main entry under corporate body is appropri-
ate. Added entries are made for the editors as well as one for the English text of
the code included in the publication (see also figure 1-79 for a further example of
text with commentary emphasized).

</p>
<p>Catalog such a work as an edition of the work with added entry for commenta-
tor. Figure 2-11 is an example.
</p>
<p>Note that for both 21.13B and 21.13C title page information and format will
determine the main entry. If title page information is ambiguous, 21.13D gives
some practical guidelines to aid in the decision. If these guidelines do not help,
the work should be entered as an edition of the work, with added entry for the
commentator.
</p>
<p>21.14. TRANSLATIONS
</p>
<p>A translation will be entered under the same heading as the original. Added entry
will be made for the translator under the provisions of 21.30K1. That is to say, if
the translation is in verse, if the translation is important in its own right, if it has
been translated into the same language more than once, or if a library user might
have reason to think from the wording of the title page that the translator was the
author of the work, make an added entry for translator.
</p>
<p>In the example shown in figure 14-36, both the original and the translation are
in verse, and La Fontaine&rsquo;s fables have been translated into English more than once.
</p>
<p>The work shown in figure 14-37 is a translation, entered under the heading
for the original work (Goethe). On the other hand, figure 14-38 catalogs a free
translation or adaptation of the same work. As such, it is treated according to the
provisions of 21.10 and entered under the name of the translator/adapter, who is
regarded as the author of the adaptation.
</p>
<p>21.14B. A collection of translations of works by different authors will be
entered as a collection under the provisions of 21.7, with an added entry for the
translator (see figure 14-39).

<p>21.15. TEXTS PUBLISHED WITH BIOGRAPHICAL/CRITICAL MATERIAL
</p>
<p>This rule applies to publications consisting of works, letters, etc., of an author
together with biographical or critical material about this author by another person.
Main entry for such a work, in essence, depends on the wording of the title page.
</p>
<p>21.15A. If the title page refers to the critic-biographer as author, main entry is
under his or her name, with added entry for the other person. The example shown
in figure 14-40 consists of a thirty-six-page section of biography-commentary by
Dreiser, followed by selections from Thoreau&rsquo;s works.
</p>
<p>21.15B. If the author of the biographical material is represented as an editor
or compiler, main entry is under the name of the author of the text. Give an added
entry to the editor, compiler, etc. The example shown in figure 14-41 consists of
forty pages of biographical material about the diarist, followed by the diary,</p>

will be under the name of the author of the text, no matter how brief its extent.
Fourteen pages of text is a small portion of the total extent of the example shown
in figure 14-42. Nonetheless, entry will be under the name of the author of the text
(see also 21.24).

<p>If, on the other hand, the person who wrote the text is not represented as the
author, but is, instead, listed as being an editor, entry will be under the name of
the artist. Give added entry to the writer of the text (see figure 14-43).
</p>
<p>Art catalogs present a special situation. If a catalog pertaining to a single artist
contains reproductions of his or her works, 21.17B should be applied. If the
catalog does not include reproductions of the artist&rsquo;s work, first 21.1B2a should
be applied (entry under the corporate body issuing the catalog if it holds all the
listed works); if that is not applicable, entry is under the author of the text of the
catalog, if known; if neither of these is applicable, entry is under title (LCRI

<p>and next for a work involving the collaboration of more than one author. Rules
21.9 through 21.23 deal with works that are modifications of previously published
works&mdash;texts, art works, musical works, and sound recordings. Rules 21.24 through
21.27 address themselves to new works in which more than one person or corpo-
rate body has performed different functions and in which no one is clearly prin-
cipally responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of the work.
</p>
<p>21.24. COLLABORATION BETWEEN ARTIST AND WRITER
</p>
<p>AACR2 21.24 is based on AACR1 rule 8A, which was clarified by the Library of
Congress in Cataloging Service Bulletin 96 (Nov. 1970): &ldquo;the word &lsquo;collaboration&rsquo; as
used in this rule means that the author and artist have worked jointly to produce
the work. . . . If there is an indication, or a reasonable assumption, that the text has
been illustrated after its completion, collaboration is not involved.&rdquo; Although this
rule interpretation is no longer in force, it is still a good statement of the distinc-
tion between 21.24 (&ldquo;Collaboration between Artist and Writer&rdquo;) and 21.11 (&ldquo;Illus-
trated Texts&rdquo;), as well as 21.17 (&ldquo;Reproductions of Two or More Art Works&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>The distinction between this rule and the previous rules mentioned is the
matter of collaboration. Does the work in question seem to have been a joint
effort, or was one part done independently of the other? The example shown in
figure 14-44 is clearly a collaborative effort. Entry is under the name of the person

<p>21.25. REPORTS OF INTERVIEWS OR EXCHANGES
</p>
<p>21.25A. Under the stipulations of this rule, if the reporter simply records the
words of the person(s) being interviewed without participating in the discussion,
follow 21.6 (&ldquo;Works of Shared Responsibility&rdquo;) to determine main entry. For an
interview involving two participants, as shown in figure 14-45, entry will be
under the first named. An added entry is to be made for the other participant, and
also for a &ldquo;prominently named&rdquo; reporter (see 0.8 for definition of &ldquo;prominently&rdquo;).

<p>21.25B. This rule is related to 21.10 (&ldquo;Adaptations of Texts&rdquo;). If the reporter
has restated the conversation rather than simply making a verbatim report or
transcript, then he or she is considered to be responsible for the intellectual
content of the interview. Make main entry under the name of the reporter (see
figure 14-46).
</p>
<p>21.26. SPIRIT COMMUNICATIONS
</p>
<p>The predecessor of this rule was AACR1 rule 13C, which, like its predecessor,
ALA 1949 rule 11, called for main entry under the medium or &ldquo;person reporting
the communication&rdquo; for communications &ldquo;purporting to have been received from
a spirit.&rdquo; Whether the editors of AACR2 joined the society of true believers is not
known; it is more likely that they decided that this rule, like all others, should be
based on information presented in the work, which is ordinarily to be accepted at
its face value, and that the catalog entry is simply to describe the work rather than
to serve as a pejorative judgment of its truth or fiction. At any rate, under AACR2
the earlier rule was reversed. Main entry will be under the name of the spirit, with
added entry for the medium, as shown in figure 14-47.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.27. ACADEMIC DISPUTATIONS
</p>
<p>This rarely used rule is mainly of historical interest, particularly in American
libraries, because it applies to dissertations prepared in European universities
before 1801. The respondent is the candidate for a degree who defends a thesis
against objections proposed by the praeses, or faculty moderator and others, called
opponents. Since it is usually not clear which of the participants actually wrote
the work, AACR2 takes the practical stand that the work is entered under the
heading for the praeses with an added entry for the respondent (see figure 14-48)

<p>21.28B. General rule
</p>
<p>The decision to describe a related work as an independent work is sometimes
obvious. Although a concordance could not exist had not the &ldquo;parent&rdquo; work been
written, the person who puts such a work together is clearly an author, under
terms of the definition given in 21.1A1. Enter such works as independent entries,
with added entry (name-title) for the related work (see figure 14-49).

</p>
<p>Similar to concordances are indexes. AACR2 21.28B calls for an added entry
for the indexed work. The Library of Congress instructs its catalogers not to
include such an entry in the record (LCRI 21.28B, Dec. 11, 1989). Instead, the cat-
aloger should add a subject heading (6XX field) for the work followed by the sub-
division &ldquo;--Indexes&rdquo; (see figure 14-50; form subdivisions in subject heading
strings are preceded by subfield &Dagger;v).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Bible poses a special problem for 21.28B. Under the rule for Bible uniform
titles (AACR2 25.18), at least three elements are required: the name of the text, the
language of the text, and the date of publication. Figure 14-51 shows cataloging
for a Bible concordance. Because it is a concordance for any publication of the
Authorized (King James) version, no year could be attached to a related works
added entry. Furthermore, related works entries do not give language of transla-
tion. Because neither language nor date can be added to a desired Bible related
works heading, it cannot be made. Instead, make a subject heading with the sub-
division &ldquo;--Concordances, English . . . ,&rdquo; as shown in the 630 field of figure 14-51.

<p>Excerpts from periodicals are cataloged as independent works. In many cases
these works will fall under the provisions of 21.7 (&ldquo;Collections of Works by
Different Persons or Bodies&rdquo;), and will be given main entry under title. Added
entry will be made under a prominently named compiler or editor, under the
provisions of 21.7B, as well as under the name of the periodical to which the work
is related (see figure 14-52).
</p>
<p>Note that 21.28 applies to librettos and other texts set to music as well as to
related works such as concordances, etc. Preferred treatment under 21.28 is entry
under the individual responsible for the intellectual content of the work in hand,
the librettist, with an added entry (name-title) for the musical work. An alterna-
tive rule given as a footnote to 21.28A1 allows entry under the heading appropri-
ate to the musical work, with name-title added entry for the librettist. The Library
of Congress, the National Library of Canada, and the National Library of Australia
all apply the alternative rule (see LCRI 21.28A, Jan. 25, 1989; NLCRI 21.28A; and
NLARI 21.28A; see figure 14-53).</p>

<p>Not quite as obvious as the examples shown in figures 14-49 through 14-53 is
entry for a supplement, a teacher&rsquo;s manual, etc., particularly when, except for the
generic terms supplement, teacher&rsquo;s guide, etc., the work has the same title, and
often the same author, as the parent volume. If, in the cataloger&rsquo;s judgment, such

<p>Added Entries
</p>
<p>Rules 21.29 and 21.30 gather in one place all of the specific rules for added entry
set forth in previous sections of AACR2 chapter 21, sorting them into categories
according to function. These rules also make useful generalizations about the
purpose of added entries as added points of access to the works included in a
library catalog.
</p>
<p>21.29. GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>An added entry should be made if the cataloger believes that catalog users might
reasonably search for a work or cataloged item under a person or corporate body
not listed as main entry. AACR2 goes farther than previous cataloging codes in
allowing added entries beyond those specifically prescribed in individual rules.
For example, under 21.29D and 21.30H added entries may be made in addition to
others suggested by 21.30, depending on the library&rsquo;s policy.
</p>
<p>The cataloger is reminded that, in common with other rules in AACR2
chapter 21, rules 21.29 and 21.30 pertain equally to all types of library materials.
However, because LC and North American practice departs somewhat from
AACR2 in the matter of assigning added entries to sound recordings and certain
other types of audiovisual materials, the Library of Congress has set forth exten-
sive guidelines in LCRI 21.29 (Jan. 5 and Feb. 1, 1989).
</p>
<p>Added entries are conventionally given in the following order:
</p>
<p>1. Personal name
2. Personal name/title
3. Corporate name
4. Corporate name/title
5. Uniform title (added entry for works entered under title)
6. Entry for the title proper
7. Entries for other forms of the title
8. Series (LCRI 21.29, Jan. 5, 1989).
</p>
<p>This order was based on the catalog card, and is necessarily modified in
MARC records. For example, titles (nos. 6 and 7) are generally traced from the 245
and 246 fields, not 7XX fields; and series (no. 8) is traced from a 440 or 8XX field.
However, the first five categories are traced from 7XX fields, and it does make
some sense to organize these in the conventional order.
</p>
<p>21.30. SPECIFIC RULES
</p>
<p>21.30D. Editors and compilers
</p>
<p>This rule calls for an added entry for a &ldquo;prominently named&rdquo; editor or compiler
of a monographic work (see figure 14-55).
</p>
<p>Note that an added entry for the editor of a serial is not routinely made. See
discussion of rule 12.1F3 in Handbook.
</p>
<p>348 CH O I C E O F AC C E S S PO I N T S</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.30E. Corporate bodies
</p>
<p>Make an added entry for a prominently named corporate body that, under terms
of 21.1B2, did not receive main entry (see, for example, figures 14-13, 14-14, and
14-15). In addition, an added entry will be made for a prominently named corpo-
rate body that sponsors a meeting (LCRI 21.30E, Sept. 2001; see figure 14-6).
</p>
<p>In case of doubt, make an added entry for a corporate body, unless it func-
tions solely as a publisher, distributor, or manufacturer.
</p>
<p>21.30F. Other related persons or bodies
</p>
<p>This rule specifies, but is not limited to, three examples for which an added entry
would be appropriate. One of these is for the person honored by a Festschrift. A
Festschrift is a publication consisting of a number of essays or short articles, gener-
ally on the honoree&rsquo;s subject interest, brought together to honor a person or to cele-
brate an anniversary, and normally written for the publication in question. As a col-
laborative effort of different persons or bodies, a Festschrift is an example of a work
covered by 21.6. Because a Festschrift normally contains contributions of many
more than three authors, it will usually be given title main entry (see figure 14-56).
</p>
<p>The addressee of a collection of letters would, under normal provisions of the
rules, not be given an added entry; that person in no way contributed to the intellec-
tual or artistic content of the work being cataloged. In addition, ordinarily, a subject
entry for the addressee would be inappropriate. But, obviously, the name of the
addressee can serve as an important access point to the catalog entry for the work.
An added entry for such an individual is stipulated by 21.30F (see figure 14-57).

<p>21.30G. Related works
</p>
<p>Make an added entry under the heading for a work to which the work being cat-
aloged is closely related (see figure 1-60). Relate a serial with a changed title to the
earlier (or later) title by means of an added entry in a linking field (normally 780
or 785) for the related heading (see figures 12-7 and 12-8). See also discussion of
related works in this Handbook at 21.28.
</p>
<p>21.30H. Other relationships
</p>
<p>Like 21.29D, 21.30H acts as a sort of &ldquo;escape valve,&rdquo; allowing libraries to make
added entries for headings important to them but not called for elsewhere in the
rules (for example, a library collecting the work of a particular printer might want
to bring together the production of the printer in its catalog by tracing its name
via added entries).
</p>
<p>21.30J. Titles
</p>
<p>A title added entry will be made for every work, except, obviously, those entered
under title as main entry. The current rule, revised in 2003, replaces a list of excep-
tions. Henceforth all titles entered under personal name, corporate name, or
uniform title will be given an added entry. The option allows cataloging agencies
to make exceptions, but there seems to be little reason to do so since most systems
trace the 245 field whether it is coded to trace or not.
</p>
<p>In the MARC record, the title proper is traced from the 245 field itself; this is
controlled by the first indicator. If coded &ldquo;1&rdquo; the title will trace; if coded &ldquo;0&rdquo; the
title will not trace.6 If the cataloger needs to trace a part of the title other than the
title proper, the 246 field is used (see figure 10-3 and discussion in this Handbook
at 1.7B4). Parallel titles are traced in this fashion as well. As discussed at 1.7B4,
when using the 246 field to trace titles, initial articles must be omitted (see figure
1-19). This is also true of the title in a name-title added entry (see figure 1-56a).
</p>
<p>Previous to 1995, titles (in MARC formats other than serials format) now
traced from the 246 field were traced from the 740 field. Some titles are still traced
from this field. These are uncontrolled related titles and uncontrolled analytical
titles. &ldquo;Uncontrolled&rdquo; means &ldquo;not in authority form.&rdquo; For example, in figure 14-29,
the three plays are analyzed in 700 name-title added entries; however, the titles in
these entries are in &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; or authority form, quite different from the titles
as they appear in the book. A 740 field with indicators &ldquo;02&rdquo; (the second indicator
&ldquo;2&rdquo; means &ldquo;analytic entry&rdquo;) is used to give access to these forms of the title (see
MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data, 1999 ed., 740, p. 2, Feb. 1999). The first indi-
cator of any 740 field, which shows nonfiling characters, should always be coded
&ldquo;0&rdquo; and initial articles left off the title (LCRI 21.30J, June 2002, p. 7). This includes
languages distinguishing by case: drop all initial articles, even those not in the
nominative case (CSB 52, spring 1991, p. 26).
</p>
<p>Although provided for in the MARC format, in North American practice the
740 field is not used for related titles. Instead, the controlled form of the title
(uniform title) should be used (recorded in 700-730 fields) (see LCRI 21.30J, June
2002, p. 7). For examples, see figures 1-78 and 1-112.
</p>
<p>CH O I C E O F AC C E S S PO I N T S 351</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Extremely detailed guidelines for recording title added entries in 245, 246,
7XX name-title, and 740 fields will be found in LCRI 21.30J (June 2002).
</p>
<p>The MARC database may also trace other title fields, such as the 240 field
(uniform title) and subfield &Dagger;t in a 7XX field (name-title added entry). This depends
on the local system parameters. Figures in this Handbook are cataloged under the
assumption that such fields do trace. Therefore, in the Handbook figures, 740 and
246 fields that simply repeat the contents of other fields are not given.
</p>
<p>21.30L. Series
</p>
<p>The rule instructs the cataloger to make an added entry under the heading for a
series &ldquo;if it provides a useful collocation.&rdquo; This sounds as though the cataloger is
to make a decision for each item on a case-by-case basis, but in fact the series area
is one that falls under authority control; the decision whether to trace a series is
made once for the entire series and thereafter every item in the series is traced by
the series name or not depending on the decision recorded in the authority record
(see detailed discussion in Handbook at 1.6 and LCRI 21.30L, June 2002).
</p>
<p>The advent of online cataloging has caused many libraries to become more
relaxed about tracing series (in the days when a complete card had to be typed for
every added entry, including an added entry for the series, a reluctance to trace
certain series was certainly understandable). More and more libraries now simply
trace all series. For example, the Library of Congress&rsquo;s current policy is to &ldquo;make
added entries for all analyzed series established after August 31, 1989&rdquo; (LCRI
21.30L, June 2002). This replaces a policy with very elaborate rules for deciding
whether or not to trace series (see CSB 41, summer 1988, p. 24&ndash;27). The decision
whether to trace a given series is a policy decision entirely up to the library.
</p>
<p>Special Rules
</p>
<p>Certain Legal Publications
</p>
<p>Rules 21.31 through 21.36 include laws, administrative regulations, constitutions
and charters, court rules, and treaties. Previous cataloging rules for legal publica-
tions were criticized because, in contradiction to general cataloging principles, they
were based on form rather than authorship. Materials included were formerly en-
tered under governmental jurisdiction, followed by a form subheading appropriate
to the type of publication. A federal law of the United States would, under pre-
AACR2 rules, have taken the heading &ldquo;United States. Laws, statutes, etc.&rdquo; Critics
of the rules, led by Seymour Lubetzky, argued that these form subheadings were
nothing but a kind of subject heading that served to gather material under the name
of the governmental jurisdiction. The critics also said that the function could just
as well be taken care of by true subject headings. Calling them &ldquo;bastardized author
entries,&rdquo; Lubetzky called for the elimination of these quasi-author, quasi-subject
headings from rules that otherwise dealt with conditions of author responsibility.7
</p>
<p>352 CH O I C E O F AC C E S S PO I N T S</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>But the form subheadings, though they may have lacked consistency with
principle, had custom on their side, going back at least as far as the 1908 Anglo-
American code.8 Those in favor of them argued that legal publications offered
problems of authorship so complex that it was difficult to arrive at a valid state-
ment of authorship. A law is an act of a particular political jurisdiction that comes
into being by the agency of many different people acting as individuals, commit-
tees, etc. A law may be passed by Congress, but it is not valid until it is signed by
the president. Who, then, is responsible for bringing it into being? In legal terms
Congress and the president merely act as agents, not as authors. The United States
is responsible for the law, and therefore the United States is author of the law.
</p>
<p>Thus reasoned Lubetzky, as long ago as 1960, in his Code of Cataloging Rules.
And yet in 1967, when the AACR1 appeared, the traditional form headings were
still a part of the code. Paul Dunkin, though speaking in a slightly different frame
of reference, summed the problem up when he said, &ldquo;The plain fact is that we have
here an entry which we accept because it seems to be the practical thing to do. . . .
Apparently we have grown so accustomed to the idea that we cannot change.&rdquo;9
</p>
<p>In a victory for Lubetzky, and in a return to the stipulations of Paris Principle
9.5,10 form subdivisions were eliminated from AACR2. Beginning with the 1978
code, laws, constitutions, court rules, and treaties formerly entered under the
name of the governmental jurisdiction, followed by a form subheading, are to be
entered under the name of the appropriate state or other territorial authority, with
a uniform title interposed between the heading and the transcription of the title
to aid in organizing the material.
</p>
<p>21.31B. Laws of modern jurisdictions
</p>
<p>Such laws will be entered under the heading for the jurisdiction governed. A
uniform title will be interposed between the heading and the title transcription.
Uniform titles will be discussed more fully in chapter 18 of this Handbook. Briefly,
a uniform title serves to bring all the varying issues, editions, translations, etc., of
a work together in one place in the catalog. Uniform titles for laws are to be con-
structed following rule 25.15.
</p>
<p>The descriptive information for a legal publication is transcribed following
appropriate rules in AACR2 Part I, chapter 1, etc. Added entries are to be made
for persons or bodies responsible for compiling or issuing the law, but not for the
legislative body that actually passed it. That is, as shown in figure 14-58, no added
entry will be made for &ldquo;United States. Congress.&rdquo; Nor will an added entry be
made for &ldquo;California. Legislature,&rdquo; the body responsible for the code illustrated
in figure 14-59. But entry is made for the publishers, West Publishing Company
and Legal Book Store, because they were &ldquo;responsible for compiling&rdquo; the laws.
</p>
<p>The example shown in figure 14-60 is a record for a work that includes both
the code (laws) of a city and the charter. Heading and uniform title will be made
for the material listed first on the title page. Name-title added entry is made for
the charter.

<p>Catalogers who catalog such materials will find the explanations and defini-
tions in LCRI 21.32A extremely helpful. The National Library of Canada has also
issued an explanation of implementation of 21.32B (NLCRI 21.32B).
</p>
<p>21.33. CONSTITUTIONS, CHARTERS, AND OTHER FUNDAMENTAL LAWS
</p>
<p>A constitution or charter will be entered under the heading for the jurisdiction
with no further subdivision. Contrast this rule with previous codes that stipulated
entry under jurisdiction plus the form subheading &ldquo;Constitution&rdquo; or &ldquo;Charter,&rdquo; as
appropriate. When a constitution or charter is a law of a jurisdiction other than
the one the constitution or charter governs, make an added entry for the one that
promulgated the law and in this added entry use a uniform title if appropriate
according to 25.15A. The general rule for uniform titles (25.1) may also need to be
applied to the question of a uniform title in the main entry.
</p>
<p>If there is more than one constitution for the same jurisdiction, add in paren-
theses the year of adoption to the uniform title for each. Figures 14-61 and 14-62
show two of the many French constitutions.

<p>21.35. TREATIES, INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS, ETC.
</p>
<p>21.35A1. Treaties are agreements between two or more governments. They pose
special problems for catalogers because of their nature and because of the way in
which they are drawn up. After representatives of the various governments at a
treaty conference have met, they draw up an agreement, which is signed. Then
the representatives return to their own countries, where the treaty is ratified by
the government. Then the treaty is published by the government under a title that
it creates, naming itself, of course, in first place on the title page. Each governing
body involved does this, resulting in a number of different versions of the docu-
ment. Although the text of the document should be the same, the title pages will
vary. Under which name should a treaty be entered? ALA 1949 rule 88A called for
entry under the party named first on the title page, with form subheading
&ldquo;Treaties, etc.&rdquo; AACR1 rule 25A1 preferred entry under the country of the cata-
loging agency if it was a signatory; otherwise entry would be under the party on
one side of a bilateral treaty if it is the only party on that side and there are two
or more parties on the other side; or, under the party whose catalog heading is
first in alphabetical order.
</p>
<p>AACR2 rule 21.35A1 dropped the first provision of AACR1 rule 25A1. It man-
dates entry for a treaty between two or three national governments according to
the second and third preference of the 1967 code. Thus, the example shown in
figure 14-64, which under 1967 rules was entered under &ldquo;United States&rdquo; (as the
country of the cataloging agency), will now be entered under the country coming
first in alphabetical order: Mexico. In addition, the AACR1 form subheading
&ldquo;Treaties, etc.&rdquo; is dropped to uniform title position below the heading for the
jurisdiction (see 25.16B1 for rules for form). Uniform title must be used.

<p>AACR2 calls for an added entry for the other government(s) involved; the
form is name-[uniform] title entry. Instead of added entry for the other govern-
ment, the Library of Congress makes an authority record for the main entry plus
uniform title, with cross-reference(s) from the heading(s) for the other govern-
ment(s) and uniform title(s) (LCRI 21.35A1, Feb. 1, 1989). Thus, Library of Con-
gress cataloging for figure 14-64 would omit the added entry for United States.
Treaties, etc. . . .
</p>
<p>21.35A2. Treaties involving four or more parties. In essence, this rule is
based on the general rule governing diffuse authorship (21.6C2), which states that
main entry will be under title if responsibility is shared between more than three
corporate bodies (in this case, governments).
</p>
<p>If the treaty has been issued under varying titles, do not use the title proper
of the work for title main entry. Make main entry under a uniform title. See
25.16B2 for guidance on the proper construction of a uniform title for a treaty.
</p>
<p>An example of a treaty involving four or more parties issued under differing
titles is the Maastricht Treaty (see figure 14-65).11 A U.S. cataloger would make no
added entry for signatories, because the home government is not a signatory, the
item is not published by any government, nor is any government named in the
chief source of information. Since the U.K. is a signatory, a British cataloger would
make an added entry for the U.K. with the uniform title of the treaty.
</p>
<p>As with 21.35A1, the Library of Congress does not make the added entries
called for in 21.35A2. Rather, its catalogers add appropriate cross-references to the
authority record for the uniform title of the treaty.
</p>
<p>In summary, the distinction between entry under one or the other of the gov-
ernments involved in a treaty versus entry under title proper or a uniform title is
based solely on the number of parties concerned. If two or three governments are
involved, follow 21.35A1 and enter under one of the governments, according to

<p>Although 21.37 states that sacred scripture will be entered under title, problems
of varying titles for different issues, editions, etc., will mean in almost every case
that entry under uniform title rather than title proper will be made. See rules

further examples of this rule. The example shown in figure 14-7 is of sacred scrip-
ture entered under uniform title.

does this form appear in the cataloging example, even though this is the name by
which the treaty is commonly known in the English-speaking world. The heading as
established in the Name Authority File is &ldquo;Treaty on European Union (1992),&rdquo; and this
is therefore the heading used in the figure. The authority record includes a reference
from &ldquo;Maastricht Treaty,&rdquo; which will guide the user to the correct heading.

<p>AACR2 is structured so that choice of entry and the form of the heading thus
chosen are treated as separate problems. After the cataloger has determined the
correct entry according to AACR2 chapter 21, he or she still must determine the
correct form of the entry. This consideration is important because once the deci-
sion has been made, the same form of name will be used, in most cases, for every
work by or about that person. This library practice is of long standing; a consis-
tent heading brings together in one place in the library catalog all of the works by
the person that the library holds and, in a library that has a dictionary catalog, all
the books about the person.
</p>
<p>In many cases, deciding on form for a personal name heading presents no
problem. According to library custom, the entry element for most personal names
is the surname. It is a simple matter to take the name as it appears on the title page
of the first book by a new author and to transcribe it as the main entry heading:
surname first, followed by forenames and/or initials. But things are not always
that easy. Personal names as they appear in library materials present numerous
problems. Most of these may be subsumed into three categories:
</p>
<p>1. A person may not use the same name in all of his or her works. What name
should be chosen when the person sometimes uses real name and some-
times pseudonym? And what about one who seems unable to make up her
or his mind about the fullness of name that she or he prefers? What is the
cataloger to do when a woman who has written under her maiden name
begins to use her married name in her works? Or, for that matter, when a
formerly married woman resumes the use of her maiden name?
</p>
<p>2. Some persons have compound surnames; others have a surname with a
prefix; still others have no surname. Which part of the name will be used
as the entry element?
</p>
<p>3. How is one person to be distinguished from another of identical or similar
name?

(AACR2 Chapter 22)</p>

</div>

<p>362 HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S
</p>
<p>The rules included in AACR2 chapter 22 give guidance on these and other
problems.
</p>
<p>Authority
</p>
<p>Integral to chapters 22&ndash;26 of AACR2 is the concept of authority. By long-standing
library custom, all works by or about a single entity (whether a person or a cor-
porate body) are brought together under a single heading; this heading is used
anywhere needed in the catalog record, whether as main entry (1XX field), added
entry (7XX field), subject (6XX field), or series (440/8XX field). In addition to
names, it is desirable to standardize subject headings and certain title headings,
so these are also included in authority work. This is done so that the user can look
in a single place for the desired author or topic without having to guess all the
possible forms the entry might have taken.
</p>
<p>This goal is accomplished through the library catalog&rsquo;s authority structure.
Ideally, the first time a heading appears in the library&rsquo;s catalog, the cataloger
(using the rules found in chapters 22&ndash;26) &ldquo;establishes&rdquo; the heading&rsquo;s authorized
form by creating a record in the library&rsquo;s authority file. Each heading has a single
record, and any item received after the heading has been established uses the
form exactly as found in the authority file. Any variants are recorded in the
authority record as &ldquo;search under&rdquo; references, which are communicated to the
library user via cards in the card catalog or displays in the online system.
</p>
<p>Until recently most libraries kept a card file of authority records in the catalog
department, to which catalogers referred when making decisions about headings.
Most libraries now use an online authority file as a part of their library automated
system. Like the system for recording bibliographic records for individual items
in the library, there is a MARC format for recording authority records. Details for
coding are found in the latest edition of MARC 21 Format for Authority Data (Wash-
ington, D.C.: Cataloging Distribution Service, Library of Congress), but its basic
structure is fairly simple.1
</p>
<p>The core of the record is what appears in the 1XX field. This is the authorized
form of the heading, established in accordance with chapters 22&ndash;26 of AACR2.
Because one and only one authorized form is made for any heading, there will
never be more than one 1XX field in an authority record.
</p>
<p>There are five types of 1XX fields that pertain to AACR2 (other 1XX fields are
used for subject and form authority records):
</p>
<p>100 Personal name
110 Corporate name
111 Meeting name
130 Uniform title (also used for series titles)
151 Geographic name
</p>
<p>References are generated from authority records through the 4XX and the
5XX fields. 4XX fields generate &ldquo;search under&rdquo; references and contain unautho-
rized forms of the heading in the 1XX field chosen mainly according to the stipu-
lations of AACR2 chapter 26. 5XX fields generate &ldquo;search also under&rdquo; references,
and must therefore themselves be the authorized form of headings related to the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S 363
</p>
<p>heading in the 1XX field. 4XX and 5XX fields exist in the same five types as listed
above for 1XX fields:
</p>
<p>400 Personal name
410 Corporate name
411 Meeting name
430 Uniform title (also used for series titles)
451 Geographic name
</p>
<p>500 Personal name
510 Corporate name
511 Meeting name
530 Uniform title (also used for series titles)
551 Geographic name
</p>
<p>Indicators are generally similar to the corresponding bibliographic MARC
fields.
</p>
<p>6XX fields are used in the MARC authorities format for notes. Among others,
they include the 670 field, used to record where the data for the forms recorded
in the record were found; the 667 field, used to record notes about the record
internal to the catalog department; and the 663 field, used to record notes about
the heading intended to display to the public.
</p>
<p>Most of the figures in this and the following chapters will have authority
records alongside the bibliographic records. Because they are for illustrative pur-
poses, they have been simplified, showing only the 1XX field, pertinent 4XX and
5XX fields, and occasionally a 663 note field. Other note fields have not been in-
cluded. For fuller treatment of authority work, see Maxwell&rsquo;s Guide to Authority Work
(Chicago: ALA, 2002).
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress and Authority Practice
</p>
<p>The advent of shared machine-readable cataloging also made possible shared
authority work. An international English-language authority file exists, known
simply as the Name Authority File (NAF), and many libraries use its records for
their own authority files.2 The NAF originated as the Library of Congress&rsquo;s own
authority file, but in the last decade many libraries other than LC have become
contributors to it through the Name Authority Cooperative Program (NACO),
making it more than just the Library of Congress&rsquo;s authority file.3 International
practice (both in MARC tagging and AACR2 rule interpretations) has been aligned
so that authority records are now contributed by libraries outside the United States,
including British and Canadian libraries. The goal of a single, unified authority file
for the English-speaking world seems close to accomplishment.
</p>
<p>This alignment of international practice has been incorporated into the
Library of Congress Rule Interpretations (LCRI), which contributors to the NAF are
expected to follow in choice of form and references. This Handbook takes these into
account as far as possible in the discussion of AACR2 rules. In addition, the
Handbook uses, for all &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; headings (i.e., those under authority control)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>364 HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S
</p>
<p>in the figures, the forms found in the NAF at the time of its publication. This fact
explains some headings that may be formulated differently than expected from
the item illustrated in the figure. The usual case is that a form has already been
established that differs from the form found on the item. This is to be expected,
because authors tend to use different forms of their names on their various works.
</p>
<p>There is another category of &ldquo;unexpected&rdquo; headings, however, which stems
from the Library of Congress&rsquo;s practice of declaring certain pre-AACR2 headings
&ldquo;AACR2 compatible.&rdquo; When AACR2 was first introduced, the Library of Con-
gress discovered that it was unable to make all the changes required by AACR2
in its mammoth bibliographic catalog. It therefore declared that, while any new
headings would be formulated strictly in accordance with AACR2, certain cate-
gories of headings established before AACR2 would not be changed. Among
these categories are the following:
</p>
<p>Hyphens. The existing heading lacked a hyphen between compound
names, which would have been required under AACR2 (e.g., Jean-
Paul Sartre had already been established as &ldquo;Sartre, Jean Paul.&rdquo; The
hyphen required by AACR2 was not added).
</p>
<p>Pseud. The existing heading contained the term &ldquo;pseud.&rdquo; (for &ldquo;pseu-
donym&rdquo;). This is not removed from the old heading.
</p>
<p>Extraneous or missing names or initials. Certain names were established in
a fuller or less full form than required under AACR2; these
remained in the file as they were.
</p>
<p>The abbreviations &ldquo;Bp.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Abp.&rdquo; If these abbreviated titles (standing
for &ldquo;Bishop&rdquo; and &ldquo;Archbishop&rdquo;) had been established with an
otherwise acceptable form, the heading was not changed to include
the spelled-out form as required by AACR2.
</p>
<p>A full list of types of headings considered &ldquo;AACR2 compatible&rdquo; will be found
in LCRI 22.1 (May 1998). The list is of interest in explaining why certain forms are
found in the NAF but is of no consequence in the establishment of new forms,
and so it will not be discussed further in the Handbook.
</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that other national libraries issuing rule interpreta-
tions on AACR2 do not accept the Library of Congress&rsquo;s &ldquo;AACR2 compatible&rdquo;
headings (see NLCRI chapter 22 introduction, NLARI chapter 22 introduction).
This continues to be an important stumbling block to full international agreement
on shared authority records.
</p>
<p>Choice of Name
</p>
<p>22.1. GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>Catalogers should be aware that AACR2 chapter 22 distinguishes between choice
and form of name even in the examples. General rule 22.1 addresses itself only to
choice, not form, of name. Examples illustrating rules 22.1&ndash;22.3 are not in catalog
entry format; they only indicate which of several names that a person may use
should be chosen for the basis of the heading. For example, &ldquo;Jimmy Carter&rdquo; as
listed under 22.1A would be entered in the catalog as &ldquo;Carter, Jimmy.&rdquo; The</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S 365
</p>
<p>example shows how the name might appear in a work by or about former
President Carter. Not until rule 22.4 do the rules address themselves to the form
that personal names should take in the catalog. Rule 22.1A considers the name
only as the raw material from which the heading will be made.
</p>
<p>The rules of chapter 22 are based on Paris Principle 7, which calls for entry
under &ldquo;the most frequently used name . . . appearing in editions of the work cat-
alogued.&rdquo; Thus, in most instances, the cataloger will use the author&rsquo;s name as it
appears on title pages of works issued in the language in which they were
written, as long as the form of name is consistent. Both works published during
and after the author&rsquo;s lifetime should be considered. In the case of authors active
before 1801, the Library of Congress instructs its catalogers to prefer forms of
names found in modern reference sources in the person&rsquo;s language to information
taken from the chief source (LCRI 22.1B, Jan. 5, 1989).
</p>
<p>If the person is commonly known by a nickname, this form will be chosen
(see figure 15-1). Make references from the authority record to the full name if it
is known.
</p>
<p>If the person is commonly known by initials, the initials will be used, in direct
order, as the access point in the catalog (see figure 15-2; see also AACR2 22.10 and
22.18 for further explanation).

<p>22.1B. The &ldquo;commonly known&rdquo; form of an author&rsquo;s name is determined very
pragmatically. The primary evidence for the form will be that appearing in the
chief source (for a book, the title page) of the item being cataloged. Although
extensive research need not be done, it makes sense in addition to check the
library&rsquo;s catalog and any shared databases such as RLIN or OCLC for forms used
by the person in other works. Virtually the only time it is necessary to go beyond
the chief source of information and database checking is in distinguishing between
identical (conflicting) names and in establishing the &ldquo;commonly known&rdquo; name of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>366 HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S
</p>
<p>a person who is not an author. In this latter case, the form found in reference
sources in the language and country of the person being established will be used.
Caution: for purposes of this rule composers of music should be treated as
authors and the form found in the chief source preferred to that found in refer-
ence sources (LCRI 22.1B, Jan. 5, 1989).
</p>
<p>The rule explicitly includes &ldquo;books and articles written about a person&rdquo; as
part of the definition of &ldquo;reference sources&rdquo; to be used in determining the com-
monly known name. The title page of the book used in the example shown in fig-
ure 15-3 was the primary source for the name of the colorful Johnny Appleseed.
His name may also be found in such sources as James D. Hart&rsquo;s Oxford Companion
to American Literature, 6th ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 31, 119.

<p>22.1C. AACR2 22.1C changed significantly with the 2001 amendments.
Previous to 2001 terms of honor (Sir, Dame, Lord, Lady) were included in head-
ings if they commonly appeared with the name. Under new 22.1C, these are only
included if (a) the name does not include a surname or (b) the name consists only
of a surname. Note that this change does not affect the transcription of the state-
ment of responsibility, which will continue to include such items (1.1F7d). See
figure 15-4 for an example, noting the transcription of &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; in the statement of
responsibility, but its absence from the form in the 700 field. Previous to 2001, this
name would have been established &ldquo;Fletcher, Frank, Sir, 1870-1954.&rdquo; Names al-
ready established in the NAF previous to 2001 will not be changed, so there will
remain a mixture of practices, depending on when the name was established (see,
e.g., figure 1-36 for an example of the older practice).
</p>
<p>Although 22.1C also governs titles of nobility, the change will have little effect
on them because 22.12 still prescribes the addition of the title to any name if the
title commonly appears with it (see also 22.6).
</p>
<p>22.1D1. It would seem almost obvious that if an author&rsquo;s name includes
accents and other diacritical marks, that they will be retained (see figure 15-5). A
problem arises only in a few instances when a title page transcription of an
author&rsquo;s name&mdash;all in capital letters, for example&mdash;omits accents. If the cataloger
knows that the author&rsquo;s name ordinarily includes accents, they should be sup-
plied. No research needs to be done to determine this.

<p>22.1D2. Hyphens. Again, it would seem obvious that if an author chooses to
spell his or her name with a hyphen joining either given names or parts of a com-
pound surname, this choice ought to be respected by the cataloger. And so it is,
under AACR2 (see figure 15-5).
</p>
<p>22.2. CHOICE AMONG DIFFERENT NAMES
</p>
<p>22.2A. Predominant name
</p>
<p>This rule deals with problems resulting when authors are not consistent about the
way their names appear in the chief source of information in their works. If there
is doubt about the name by which the person is &ldquo;clearly&rdquo; most commonly known,
the cataloger makes a choice based on the following guidelines, in this order of
preference:
</p>
<p>1. Choose the name most frequently used by the author in his or her works.
This includes forms of name found on works issued both during and after
the person&rsquo;s lifetime.
</p>
<p>2. Choose the form of name by which the author is generally identified in ref-
erence sources. This method could produce different answers, of course,
depending on the reference sources available in a particular library.
</p>
<p>3. Choose the latest name the author has used in her or his works.
</p>
<p>(This rule does not apply to persons using pseudonyms. For these individuals,
see 22.2B.)
</p>
<p>22.2A1 implies that at least a minimal amount of research is expected of cat-
alogers as they establish authorized forms of names. Basic database checking (in
the library&rsquo;s catalog and databases such as RLIN and OCLC) is necessary if one is
to know whether or not a person is known by more than one name.
</p>
<p>22.2B. Pseudonyms
</p>
<p>22.2B1. One pseudonym. The rule for an author who writes consistently under a
single name other than his or her real name is simply a reiteration of basic rule
22.1. Because the author chooses to be identified by this name, the cataloger
should use it as any other name would be used. As a matter of fact, because cat-
alogers are not required to search names of authors that do not present an obvious
problem of identification and for which there is not a &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; (i.e., another
author with an identical or very similar name) in the catalog, a pseudonym will
not be recognized as such in most cases. The book or other material will simply
be entered under the name as it appears in the chief source of information. This is
a perfectly satisfactory way to catalog most material. As A. Jolley put it, &ldquo;It is as
impossible to count undiscovered pseudonyms as undiscovered murders.&rdquo;4
</p>
<p>The example shown in figure 15-6 is that of a well-established author who
consistently uses the same pseudonym on the title pages of her books. Catalog-
ing, following 22.2B1, will be as shown. This author&rsquo;s real name is Lady Mary
Dolling Sanders O&rsquo;Malley. To aid library users who may know the author&rsquo;s real
name and who may search under this name in the catalog, 22.2B1 calls for a ref-
erence from the real name, when this information is known. This reference will be</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>370 HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S
</p>
<p>incorporated into the authority record as shown and will appear to the catalog
user as follows:
</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Malley, Mary Dolling Sanders, 1889-1974
search under
</p>
<p>Bridge, Ann, 1889-1974
</p>
<p>Such a reference guides the library user from a form of the name not used in
the catalog to the authorized form. See AACR2 chapter 26, &ldquo;References,&rdquo; for
further discussion, general principles, and guidelines for making references.
</p>
<p>The cataloger will note that the Library of Congress has adopted the phrase
&ldquo;search under&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;see&rdquo; for the directive in references as stipulated in
AACR2 chapter 26 (see LCRI 26.1, May 21, 1990). The display in any given system
depends on the local system parameters. This Handbook follows Library of Congress
usage.
</p>
<p>Normally, the cataloger will not investigate a name found on the chief source
for library material being cataloged unless the name presents a conflict. But if evi-
dence points to something not quite usual about the name of the author, do a little
sleuthing. The jacket of the book cataloged as figure 15-7 tells the identity of the
two authors responsible for the work: &ldquo;Whit Masterson . . . is actually Bob Wade
and Bill Miller.&rdquo; Because jacket information is sometimes deliberately erroneous
in order to preserve the anonymity of a pseudonymous author, the cataloger will
be well advised to check an appropriate reference source. T. J. Carty&rsquo;s Dictionary
of Literary Pseudonyms in the English Language (London: Mansell, 1995) lists Whit
Masterson as the pseudonym for Bill Miller and Robert Wade. With this corrobo-
rating evidence, we turn again to 22.2B1.

<p>AACR2 22.2B1 applies not only to a single author who consistently uses one
pseudonym. It is closely related to 21.6D (&ldquo;Shared pseudonyms&rdquo;), which deals with
two or more authors who collaborate and who consistently use a joint pseudonym.
Because this is the form of name by which these authors wish to be identified, use
the name as it appears in the chief source of information (see figure 15-7).

</p>
<p>22.2B2. Separate bibliographic identities. This is a change from AACR2
(1978) 22.2C2. Under the provisions of the earlier rule, the cataloger was to choose
the name by which the author had come to be &ldquo;identified predominantly&rdquo; when
such an individual did not always use the same name in editions of his or her
works. Thus, all works, both mathematics and children&rsquo;s fantasy, of that split per-
sonality Charles L. Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll) were to be entered
under Lewis Carroll.
</p>
<p>AACR2 22.2B2 now provides that if a person writes works of more than one
type, and if that person chooses to use one bibliographic identity for one type and
another name for works of other types, the cataloger will choose for each work
&ldquo;the name by which it is identified.&rdquo; Thus, the literary work Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in
Wonderland will be entered under the heading Carroll, Lewis (see figure 6-2),
whereas this author&rsquo;s mathematics and logic books will find entry under the
name he used when writing in his academic discipline, Charles L. Dodgson (see
figure 15-8).
</p>
<p>When the works of an author, such as Dodgson/Carroll, are entered under
two names, the cataloger makes a pair of authority records as shown. The 663
field displays to the public.
</p>
<p>22.2B3. Contemporary authors. For a contemporary author (any author who
is still alive or who has died since Dec. 31, 1900) who uses more than one name,
enter each work under the name as it appears in the work regardless of whether
22.2B2 is applicable or not.
</p>
<p>Evan Hunter, a writer of mystery novels, sometimes uses his real name and
sometimes the pseudonym Ed McBain. His novel Every Little Crook and Nanny,
written under the name Evan Hunter, gives a clue that the alert cataloger will
follow up when he or she reads that &ldquo;the jacket photo of Evan Hunter was gra-
ciously posed for by Ed McBain&rdquo; (from the book, p. 228). Checking Carty&rsquo;s Dic-
tionary of Literary Pseudonyms, the cataloger will discover that Evan Hunter is the
pseudonym of an author who writes under a number of other pseudonyms, in-
cluding the name Ed McBain. Each of Hunter&rsquo;s books will be entered under the
name appearing on the title page, as shown in figures 15-9 and 15-10.
</p>
<p>Connect the names used by this author that are represented in your library&rsquo;s
catalog with authority records as shown. More 500 &ldquo;search also under&rdquo; fields may
be added if the library has items written under any of Hunter&rsquo;s other pseudonyms.
</p>
<p>Caution: 22.2B is limited to the cases outlined, i.e., persons who write under
a single pseudonym only (22.2B1), those who have separate bibliographic identi-
ties (22.2B2), or those who are contemporary authors (22.2B3). Therefore, the
heading for a writer who falls under none of these categories is governed by
22.2A1, even if he or she uses pseudonyms. For example, choose the most com-
monly known form for a nineteenth-century author writing under several pseu-
donyms, but who has not established separate bibliographic identities.</p>

<p>22.2C. Change of name
</p>
<p>Apply this rule to names of all persons that have been changed, except for
persons using pseudonyms. For pseudonyms, see AACR2 22.2B.
</p>
<p>Members of nobility sometimes change their names as they acquire new
titles. If one begins to use his or her new title on title pages, headings for earlier
works should be changed to reflect the changed usage. Most commonly, entries
should be changed for married women who have written before their marriage
and who use their changed name in their later works. The rule is based on general
rule 22.1, inasmuch as the later form will usually become more &ldquo;commonly
known.&rdquo;

<p>22.3. CHOICE AMONG DIFFERENT FORMS OF THE SAME NAME
</p>
<p>22.3A. Fullness
</p>
<p>An author may consistently use the same name in works published during his or
her lifetime, and yet may not be consistent in the form (fullness) of name as it
appears on title pages or other chief sources. Fullness is determined by the num-
ber of elements in a name, not the length of the elements. Thus &ldquo;R.E.A. Palmer&rdquo;
is a fuller form of the name than &ldquo;Robert Palmer&rdquo; even though the former consists
solely of initials with the surname (cf. LCRI 22.3A, Nov. 2000).
</p>
<p>British playwright Bernard Shaw is an example of the kind of inconsistency
often found. His name has variously been listed on title pages of his works as
Bernard Shaw, G. Bernard Shaw, and George Bernard Shaw. Rule 22.3A solves the
question of which of these varying forms should be chosen for entry; the rule is
consistent with general rule 22.1A in requiring the cataloger to choose &ldquo;the form

<p>22.3B. Language
</p>
<p>This rule deals with the problem presented by an author whose works appear in
more than one language and whose name appears in more than one form,
because of translation or transliteration.
</p>
<p>22.3B1. Persons using more than one language. This rule covers persons
who write in more than one language and whose name therefore appears in dif-
ferent forms. Again, the principle of choice of the &ldquo;most commonly known&rdquo; form
governs the rule, which states that the form corresponding to the &ldquo;language of
most of the works&rdquo; should be used. In case of doubt, choose the form found in ref-
erence sources of the person&rsquo;s country of residence or activity.

<p>Somhairle MacGill-Eain is a Scottish poet who writes in English under the
English form of his name, Sorley Maclean. Because he primarily writes in Gaelic,
however, the Gaelic form of his name is used for his heading, with a cross-reference
from the English form (see figure 15-15).

<p>22.3B2. Names in vernacular and Greek or Latin forms. This rule refers
chiefly to medieval Latin and Greek authors, not to persons of the classical period
(see 22.3B3).
</p>
<p>22.3B3. Names written in the roman alphabet and established in an English
form. This rule pertains to persons who have no surname and who are to be
entered under given name (Horace) or byname (a word or phrase denoting place
of origin, occupation, or other characteristic commonly associated with the person&rsquo;s
given name in reference sources, e.g., John the Baptist, Saint Francis of Assisi,
etc.). The names of many such persons have become firmly established through
common usage in English-speaking countries in an English form. Rule 22.3B3
calls for entry under the English form of the name as it is found in English-language
reference sources. Prefer Encyclopaedia Britannica, Encyclopedia Americana, or Aca-
demic American Encyclopedia. Other major specialized English-language encyclope-
dias may be consulted (e.g., New Catholic Encyclopedia, Oxford Classical Dictionary,
etc.) as appropriate (see LCRI 22.3C, Jan. 5, 1989).
</p>
<p>The rationale for the provision for Roman names is that, in the case of a
Roman of the classical period, it is difficult to establish his or her preference for
form of name from &ldquo;works by that person issued in his or her language&rdquo; (22.1B).
Rule 22.3B3 is a practical solution for librarians in most English-speaking coun-
tries; its retention indicates its acceptance among library users despite the fact
that in theory, at least, it would seem to be a stumbling block in the way of inter-
national exchange of cataloging information.
</p>
<p>The decision about the form of heading to be used for figure 15-16 was fairly
straightforward. The title page of the work being cataloged is one factor to be

<p>22.3C2. Persons entered under surname. The Library of Congress, the Na-
tional Library of Canada, and the National Library of Australia follow the alter-
native rule, footnote 4, which treats persons entered under surname essentially
the same as those entered under given name, etc., in 22.3C1. The British Library
follows the main rule, which takes the name as it is found in the original source(s)
and romanizes it according to conventional romanization tables. As seen from the
examples in AACR2, the two rules lead to quite different results.
</p>
<p>Entry Element
</p>
<p>Rules 22.2&ndash;22.3 give guidance for the establishment of a personal name that
appears in publications in more than one form. Once the form of the name has
been determined, rules 22.4&ndash;22.11 tell the cataloger which part of the name will
constitute the entry element (the first part of the name in the catalog entry). The
overriding factor governing the rules is the preference of the person when it is
known. Lacking that knowledge, the cataloger will choose the entry element
according to linguistic usage, that is, &ldquo;that part of the name under which the
person would normally be listed in authoritative alphabetic lists in his or her lan-
guage or country&rdquo; (22.4A).
</p>
<p>The rules included in this section differ slightly from Paris Principle 12, under
which entry element is to be based first on citizenship and second on the lan-
guage in which the author writes. The editors of AACR2 believed that principle
12 presented too many problems, particularly when dealing with the names of
French origin in a country such as Belgium, where practices seem to be variable.
AACR2 practice, therefore, is based on the language, not the citizenship, of the
author.
</p>
<p>The IFLA document Names of Persons was drawn up at the behest of the
International Conference on Cataloguing Principles (1961) to expedite uniform
entry of names internationally.5 Now in its fourth edition, the document is an
indispensable guide to national usage; it should be referred to in cases in which
the rules fail to give specific instructions.6
</p>
<p>22.4. GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>This rule stipulates that when a person&rsquo;s name consists of more than one part, the
part chosen as the entry element by the cataloger will be determined by the way
that person&rsquo;s name is given in alphabetical lists that show the custom of his or her
country. See examples in AACR2 and further examples throughout this text.
</p>
<p>22.5. ENTRY UNDER SURNAME
</p>
<p>This rule is to be applied only to names that contain given name(s) and surname.
For names consisting of a surname only, see 22.15A; for names consisting of a
forename only, see 22.8 and 22.11B.</p>

</p>
<p>22.5A. General rule
</p>
<p>Names formulated with a forename (or initial) and a surname will be entered
under the surname, unless subsequent rules provide otherwise. Aside from con-
ventional forename-surname names (Bernhardt, Sarah), the rule includes sur-
names represented by initials, when at least one forename is given in full. In this
case, the initial is regarded as a surname, and entry is made under the initial (see
figure 15-18).

<p>22.5B. Element other than the first treated as a surname
</p>
<p>Some individuals are identified by made-up names that do not actually contain a
surname. Malcolm X is one such individual. &ldquo;X&rdquo; is not an initial standing for a
surname (see 22.5A). However, &ldquo;X&rdquo; identifies this person and functions as if it
were a surname. Thus, entry will be made under this element (see figure 15-19).
</p>
<p>22.5C. Compound surnames
</p>
<p>22.5C1. This rule encompasses the entry of surnames that include &ldquo;two or more
proper names&rdquo; (e.g., C. Day-Lewis). It does not pertain to single surnames that
consist of two or more words (e.g., Antoine de Saint Exup&eacute;ry). The rule is divided
into eight parts, which are to be applied in the order in which they are listed.
</p>
<p>22.5C2. Preferred or established form known. Enter a person with a com-
pound surname under the element of the surname that he or she prefers. Only
rarely will the cataloger have information about the author&rsquo;s preference. The
second part of the rule is more useful; in fact, it is the only way in most cases that
the cataloger can be positive that he or she is dealing with a compound name</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>382 HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S
</p>
<p>rather than with a simple surname and one or more forenames that resemble sur-
names. The second part of the rule instructs the cataloger to check reference
sources in the person&rsquo;s language and to list the person in the form found there.
The cataloger will do well to be cautious, however. Some reference sources, such
as the Dictionary of National Biography (London: Oxford University Press, 1921&ndash;22),
enter all persons in a uniform style (in this case, under the last element of the
name) regardless of personal preference.
</p>
<p>22.5C3. Hyphenated surnames. Such names are to be entered under the first
part of the name, with reference made from the second part (see figure 15-20).
</p>
<p>Make reference as shown in the authority record from the second element
(AACR2 26.2A3). This will display as follows:

</p>
<p>22.5C4. Other compound surnames except those of married women. Check
reference sources in the language of the person when you have reason to suspect
that a name not hyphenated may be compound. Enter the person the way he or
she is listed in such sources; make references from parts of the surname not used
as entry element. Persons other than married women who use their maiden name
followed by husband&rsquo;s name are to be entered under the first element of the com-
pound name, whether hyphenated or not.

<p>Many Spanish surnames are compounds consisting of the father&rsquo;s surname
followed by the mother&rsquo;s maiden name. Those are to be entered under the first
part of the compound, after checking references to be certain that the name is
indeed compound. For more detailed information see Names of Persons, and

<p>Compound Portuguese surnames are formed differently from Spanish.
Generally speaking, the mother&rsquo;s name is the first part of the compound, the
father&rsquo;s the last. For this reason, 22.5C4 specifies that such names are to be entered
under the last element in the compound (see figure 15-22). Reference from the
first element will be made in the authority record as shown, displaying as follows:

<p>Be wary of names consisting of two or more words not themselves surnames.
Do not separate the parts of names such as &ldquo;Castelo Branco, Camilo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Espirito
Santo, Vicente Antonio de.&rdquo; It is not necessary to give references from parts of a
name not used for entry in such cases (see figure 15-23). However, do make a ref-
erence from the prefix (see 26.2A3).

<p>22.5C5. Other compound surnames: married women. Follow general rule
22.1A in establishing the name of a married woman; use the name, either married
or maiden name, by which the woman chooses to be known and by which she is
most commonly identified. If she chooses to use, in addition to forenames, both
her maiden name and her husband&rsquo;s surname, entry will be under the husband&rsquo;s
surname, unless her language is Czech, French, Hungarian, Italian, or Spanish, or
unless her name is hyphenated (for which see AACR2 22.5C3). See figure 15-11
for an example of the entry for a married woman writing under, and best known
by, her married name.
</p>
<p>22.5C6. Nature of surname uncertain. Some English- and Scandinavian-
language names have the appearance of compound names when, actually, the
author simply has a family name or other surname as his or her middle name.
Such names should be checked in reference sources. If the name cannot be found
after reasonable search or, obviously, if the cataloger discovers that the name is
not a compound surname, enter under the last part of the name. If there is a rea-
sonable possibility that catalog users will think of the name as a compound name,
make appropriate references.
</p>
<p>The American author Ernest Thompson Seton has such a name; he is some-
times referred to as Thompson Seton. Information about Seton is to be found in
Hart, Oxford Companion to American Literature (1995), which enters him as &ldquo;Seton,
Ernest [Evan] Thompson&rdquo; with the further information that &ldquo;his name was orig-
inally Ernest Seton Thompson,&rdquo; and his dates of birth and death.

<p>Entry will be as shown in figure 15-24. References are made from 400 fields
according to terms of 26.2A3.

<p>22.5C8. Words indicating relationship following surnames. The word &ldquo;junior&rdquo;
or any other word showing relationship is not to be included in the heading for
English-speaking persons, even when such a term is used regularly by the person
as a part of the name, unless the term is needed to distinguish between identical
headings. (It is, however, included in transcribing the name in the body of the
entry; see figure 1-42.) Portuguese and Brazilian surnames are exceptions to this
rule. Such a name will have entry as shown in figure 15-25. Reference is made
from a 400 field under terms of 26.2A3, displaying as follows:

(Compound surnames): enter a name with a separately written prefix under the
element most commonly used as an entry element in alphabetical listings in the
person&rsquo;s language.
</p>
<p>22.5D1. Articles and prepositions. Rule 22.5D1 provides specific rules for
various languages and countries to guide catalogers who are unsure of national

<p>Italian. Enter modern Italian names under prefix. Consult reference sources
for medieval or early modern names, which ordinarily did not include an actual
surname; the prefix was often part of a byname (e.g., Leonardo da Vinci) (see
22.8A for treatment of such names).
</p>
<p>Figure 1-63 is an example of an Italian name entered under prefix. An author-
ity record will be made including reference from the name without the prefix:

</p>
<p>It is, by the way, particularly important to make references from the part of
the surname following the prefix to the name as established for cataloging pur-
poses when, under older rules, the name would have been entered differently in
the catalog. Such is the case with D&rsquo;Annunzio, which under ALA 1949 rules was
entered as &ldquo;Annunzio, Gabriele d&rsquo;.&rdquo;

<p>Portuguese. The part of the surname following the prefix is used for entry (see
figure 15-33). Reference, based on the authority record, will display:

<p>Spanish. In almost all cases, entry will be under the part of the name follow-
ing the prefix. Note that the rule states that if the prefix consists of an article only,
the cataloger is to enter under the article. Thus, if the name includes an article (el,
la, lo, los, las) and a preposition (de), entry will be under the part of the name fol-
lowing prefixes (see figure 15-34). References generated by the authority record
display as follows:

<p>22.6. ENTRY UNDER TITLE OF NOBILITY
</p>
<p>This rule, which should be compared to 22.12, is based on AACR2 rule 22.1A; that
is, entry should be made under the form of the name by which the person is com-
monly known. If a nobleman or -woman uses title rather than family name in his
or her works, or if such an individual who is not an author is known primarily by
his or her title and is so listed in appropriate reference sources, such an individ-
ual should be listed under the proper name in the title of nobility rather than
under family name. Check reference sources to identify the individual&rsquo;s rank and
personal name accurately.
</p>
<p>Two noblemen better known by title than by family name are the Duke of
Wellington and the Earl of Lauderdale. Encyclopaedia Britannica (2002) lists each of
them under his title, followed by his family name and dates.8 Entry should be
under title, followed by the personal name in direct order, and the term of rank
excluding any numbers (e.g., not &ldquo;2nd Earl of . . .&rdquo;). The term of rank, as a title, is
placed in subfield &Dagger;c of the MARC field (see figure 15-36).
</p>
<p>Rule 22.6A stipulates that a reference will be made from the family name for
a person entered under name in nobility. References generated from the author-
ity records for the example shown in figure 15-36 follow:

</p>
<p>Very often application of rule 22.6A for persons to be entered under the
proper name in the title of nobility, such as the Duke of Wellington and the Earl
of Lauderdale, results in an entry that seems to violate the spirit of general rule
22.1, that the cataloger will choose as the basis of a heading for a person &ldquo;the
name by which he or she is commonly known.&rdquo; Often the name in nobility (Earl
of Lauderdale, for example) is the only name found in chief sources of informa-
tion of that person&rsquo;s works. Nonetheless, 22.6A directs the cataloger to add the
personal name (forenames and family name) in direct order (e.g., James Maitland)
followed by the term of rank (e.g., Earl of). Application of this rule to the Earl of
Lauderdale results in the heading &ldquo;Lauderdale, James Maitland, Earl of,&rdquo; despite
the fact that &ldquo;Earl of Lauderdale&rdquo; is the form of name by which he is commonly
known.9
</p>
<p>Rule 22.6 specifies that the cataloger is to exclude unused forenames. LCRI
22.6 (Jan. 5, 1989) clarifies this as follows: &ldquo;If the person of nobility is an author,
use in the heading the forenames most commonly found in the chief sources of
information of the person&rsquo;s works. If no forenames are found in the chief sources,
or if the person is not primarily known as an author, consult reference sources. If
reference sources vary, use the least number of forenames commonly found.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Reference sources uniformly list Lauderdale and Wellington as established in
figure 15-36 (see also figure 1-66).

members of other ranks of British peerage.

</p>
<p>The cataloger should be aware that certain British titles below the rank of
baron and certain other titles for persons of other countries are simply terms of
honor. These persons are entered under family name.
</p>
<p>Sequential numbers are not used with a title of nobility; in case two or more
of the bearers of such a title have the same personal name, they should be distin-
guished in the same fashion as other persons with identical names, by adding
dates of birth and death (22.17).
</p>
<p>Whatever the components of the name may be, if a nobleman uses his title,
title name should be the entry word. Family name in direct order comes next, fol-
lowed by the title. In the example shown in figure 15-37, no reference is needed
from family name to surname in nobility, because they are the same.

<p>22.8. ENTRY UNDER GIVEN NAME, ETC.
</p>
<p>A person who is not commonly identified by a surname (or a name that appears
to be a surname) and who is not identified by a title of nobility should be checked
in an English-language reference source and entered accordingly. If the name
includes an element that appears to be a surname, and it is not clear (e.g., from
reference sources, etc.) that it is not a surname, treat it as though it were.
</p>
<p>Many names of this type include words or phrases denoting place of origin,
etc. These are not surnames. A name that includes such information will be entered
in direct order, with the given name separated from the descriptive phrase by a
comma. The descriptive phrase is entered in subfield &Dagger;c (see figure 15-38).</p>

<p>22.9. ENTRY OF OTHER NAMES
</p>
<p>22.9A. Roman names
</p>
<p>This rule should be correlated with 22.3B3; as indicated under that rule, a Roman
of classical times &ldquo;whose name has become well established in an English form&rdquo;
will be searched in English-language reference sources. Entry will be under the
part of the name &ldquo;most commonly used&rdquo; in such sources.
</p>
<p>Ovid is entered as &ldquo;Ovid&rdquo; in Encyclopaedia Britannica (2002), Encyclopedia
Americana (2001), and Oxford Classical Dictionary (2003), with the added informa-
tion that the Latin form of his name is Publius Ovidius Naso. Each of these
sources also gives his dates. Entry will be as found in the reference sources (see
figure 15-39).
</p>
<p>Note that Latin names, as with all languages that decline nouns, should be
given in headings and references in the nominative case only, not necessarily in
the case in which they appear in the source. See figure 14-1. No reference should
be made from the genitive form of Ovid&rsquo;s name (Publii Ovidii Nasonis).
</p>
<p>22.10. ENTRY UNDER INITIALS, LETTERS, OR NUMERALS
</p>
<p>If an author consistently uses initials for identification in his or her works, the ini-
tials, in direct order, will be used as main entry. If the initials have been used by
more than one author, see 22.18 for an addition to resolve a conflict.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S 399
</p>
<p>If the name includes typographic devices (ellipses, asterisks, etc.), include
them if they appear as part of a multiletter abbreviation of a name; omit them if
they follow single letter initials. Thus the form of the abb&eacute; de B... is entered &ldquo;B.,
abb&eacute; de,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;B..., abb&eacute; de.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Some attempt should be made, by looking in dictionaries of pseudonyms,
anonyms, etc., to find the identity of the author. In the example shown in figure
15-40, Carty&rsquo;s Dictionary of Literary Pseudonyms cited above at 22.2B1 gives the
information that &ldquo;A.L.O.E.&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;A Lady of England&rdquo; and that the initials
are the pseudonym of Charlotte Maria Tucker. Make references from those forms
(26.2A2) in the authority record, causing the following displays:

<p>AACR2 calls for a name-title reference from the inverted form of the initials
to the direct order form without the title. This would be accomplished by adding
</p>
<p>400 1 &Dagger;a E., A. L. O., &Dagger;d 1821-1893. &Dagger;t Giant-killer
</p>
<p>to the authority record for A. L. O. E., which would produce the following reference:

search under
</p>
<p>A. L. O. E., 1821-1893
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress will not make these name-title references. Instead,
LC instructs its catalogers (and contributors to the Name Authority File) simply to
make a reference from the inverted form without title, as shown in the authority
record accompanying figure 15-40. This sensible rule interpretation avoids unnec-
essary multiplicity of references (see LCRI 22.10, Feb. 15, 1994).

<p>22.11. ENTRY UNDER PHRASE
</p>
<p>22.11A. Sometimes a person may disguise his or her identity by using a phrase for
identification. Following the general principles of 22.1, if this is the appellation by
which the person is commonly known, this phrase will be used for the heading.
If the phrase or appellation does not contain a forename, or consists of a forename</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S 401
</p>
<p>preceded by a term other than a term of address or title, it will be entered in direct
order. Thus, the cataloger selects &ldquo;Old Sleuth&rdquo; as the correct form for the main
entry in figure 1-8.
</p>
<p>22.11B. If a person uses a forename plus a term of address or a title of posi-
tion or office in his or her works, enter under forename, followed by the word or
phrase. See figure 1-76, The Boy&rsquo;s Book of Sports and Games, with main entry as:
John, Uncle. A reference is made from the direct form of name. The authority
record for John, Uncle, would be constructed as follows:
</p>
<p>100 0 &Dagger;a John, &Dagger;c Uncle
</p>
<p>400 0 &Dagger;a Uncle John
</p>
<p>and would display:
</p>
<p>Uncle John
search under
</p>
<p>John, Uncle
</p>
<p>Note that 22.11B refers to a person using a forename plus term of address, etc.
For a person who uses a surname plus term of address, see 22.15.
</p>
<p>22.11D. Correlate this rule with 21.5C, which deals with choice of entry for
works identified by a characterizing word or phrase, etc. In figure 14-23, the
author is identified only as &ldquo;an old author,&rdquo; which will be chosen as the form of
entry. Each word of the phrase is capitalized.
</p>
<p>Rule 22.11D states that a characterizing word or phrase is to be used as the
heading for a person &ldquo;if that person is commonly identified by it in the chief
sources of information of his or her works and in reference sources.&rdquo; The lan-
guage of the rule implies that even if the author&rsquo;s real name is known, the phrase
is to be used if the person is so characterized in chief sources of information. This
is not the case. 21.5C makes it clear that works are entered under phrase headings
only if the true identity of the author is unknown. This sometimes comes into play
when the author identifies himself or herself by a phrase including the title of
another of his or her works. Thus, because it is known that Memoirs of a Fox-
Hunting Man is by Siegfried Sassoon, the real name of the author is used as
heading for his Memoirs of an Infantry Officer (see last example, AACR2 22.11D).
However, if the author&rsquo;s name is not known, the heading will be the phrase
naming another work that is given in the statement of responsibility. Notice the
capitalization of the statement of responsibility: the word &ldquo;Author&rdquo; is capitalized
as the beginning of the identifying element, and the words in the title are capital-
ized as they would be in a title area transcription (see figure 15-41).
</p>
<p>Additions to Names
</p>
<p>The rules thus far have dealt with general principles governing the choice of
names when these appear in different forms in various places and with the
problem of determining which part of the name chosen according to AACR2
22.1&ndash;22.3 to use as the entry element. Certain additions to personal names will be
made under some circumstances. Rules 22.12 through 22.20 address themselves
to these matters.</p>

<p>22.12. TITLES OF NOBILITY
</p>
<p>22.12 was revised in 2001 by deleting 22.12B, which had stipulated the addition
of British terms of honor to certain name headings. These will no longer be added
to headings, although headings already established under the old rule will not be
revised (see discussion at 22.1C and figure 15-4).
</p>
<p>22.12A. This rule instructs the cataloger to add the title of nobility (in subfield
&Dagger;c) to a nobleman or noblewoman&rsquo;s heading, as already discussed at 22.6.
</p>
<p>If a nobleman or noblewoman chooses to write using his or her family name
instead of name in nobility, the person&rsquo;s preference is followed. See figure 15-42
for an example of such a practice. Although Dorothy Wellesley is the Duchess of
Wellington, she chooses to identify herself by her family name. Because she does
not use her title, no title will be added to her name. However, make reference
from her title of nobility, as shown in the authority record. This will display:
</p>
<p>Wellington, Dorothy Wellesley, Duchess of, 1889-1956
search under
</p>
<p>Wellesley, Dorothy, 1889-1956
</p>
<p>The German title &ldquo;F&uuml;rst,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;prince,&rdquo; was given the German states-
man Bismarck in 1871. Because Bismarck was known by the title, it is used as part
of the heading (see figure 15-43).

</p>
<p>Compare 22.12A with 22.6 (&ldquo;Entry under Title of Nobility&rdquo;). Both rules follow
general principles as set forth under AACR2 22.1, inasmuch as each calls for entry
under the name by which the individual chooses to identify himself or herself,
either the name in nobility or the family name.
</p>
<p>22.13. SAINTS
</p>
<p>22.13A. The name of a saint will be established according to appropriate rules
22.1&ndash;22.11. The word &ldquo;saint&rdquo; is added to the name in subfield &Dagger;c as it is thus estab-
lished (see figure 1-94), unless the person was a pope, emperor, empress, king, or
queen, in which case, see 22.16A&ndash;22.16B.
</p>
<p>22.13B. A suitable word or phrase will be added following the word &ldquo;saint&rdquo;
(still in subfield &Dagger;c) and preceding dates (if any) to distinguish between two saints
with identical names. This will be done even if dates are available. Determine
uniqueness of saints&rsquo; names by checking reference sources such as F. G. Hol-
weck&rsquo;s Biographical Dictionary of the Saints (Detroit: Omnigraphics, 1990). This rule
seems to be a curious exception to the general rules for distinguishing between
identical names by the addition of dates (22.17) or, lacking dates, a distinguishing
term in parentheses (22.18).
</p>
<p>A distinguishing phrase was added to the example shown in figure 15-44 be-
cause &ldquo;Cyril, Saint, Patriarch of Alexandria, ca. 370-444&rdquo; has also been established.

<p>HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S 405
</p>
<p>The form of Cyril&rsquo;s name, following AACR2 22.3B3, is established according to
citations found in such English-language reference sources as Encyclopaedia
Britannica (2002) and New Catholic Encyclopedia (2003).
</p>
<p>A reference will be made from the Latin and Greek forms of the author&rsquo;s
name, as seen in the authority record.
</p>
<p>For another example of this rule, see figure 1-39.
</p>
<p>22.14. SPIRITS
</p>
<p>Purported communications from spirits are entered under the name of the spirit
(see 21.26). If the spirit is supposed to have been a real person, follow AACR2
rules and establish the name of that person (if not already in the authority file).
Add the word (Spirit) in subfield &Dagger;c to the complete heading for the person. Note
that if the name established for the living person includes dates, these will be
retained (cf. LCRI 22.14, Jan. 5, 1989), e.g.,
</p>
<p>100 1 &Dagger;a Beethoven, Ludwig van, &Dagger;d 1770-1827 &Dagger;c (Spirit)
</p>
<p>See figure 14-47 for an example of spirit communication.
</p>
<p>22.15. ADDITIONS TO NAMES ENTERED UNDER SURNAME
</p>
<p>Apply this rule to names of persons who identify themselves by their surname
and a term of address (e.g., Mrs. Oliphant) (see figure 1-40). The heading will be
entered under the surname, with the term in subfield &Dagger;c. Caution: do not use this
rule for persons of nobility who are entered under title of nobility. A title of nobil-
ity is not regarded as a surname. For such persons, see 22.6.
</p>
<p>Rule 22.15 includes two types of names. One is phrase headings, most of
which are pseudonymous. The author of books for children who identifies himself
as Dr. Seuss is an example. Such headings will be entered under surname (real or
pseudonymous) followed by the associated word (see figure 15-45). A reference
will be made from the name in direct order via the authority record, and will
display:
</p>
<p>Dr. Seuss
search under
</p>
<p>Seuss, Dr.
</p>
<p>The other type of name covered by 22.15 is that of a person who normally
identifies himself or herself by actual surname plus term of address. This was a
common practice particularly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for
women authors, Mrs. Oliphant being a typical example. The rule calls for entry of
such individuals under the &ldquo;commonly known&rdquo; form of their name (e.g., Oli-
phant, Mrs.). Although it would seem from 22.15A that all names covered by
22.15 should have reference from the name in direct order, the Library of Con-
gress has clarified this directive to apply only to phrase headings (i.e., those
covered by type 1 above). A reference in direct order is not necessary for a name
such as Mrs. Oliphant (LCRI 22.15A, Jan. 5, 1989).
</p>
<p>See discussion under 22.18 for further additions to names covered by 22.15,
type 2, such as Mrs. Oliphant.</p>

</p>
<p>22.15B. Terms of address of married women
</p>
<p>A married woman who chooses to identify herself in her works by her husband&rsquo;s
name plus the term of address &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo; (or the equivalent in other languages) will
be entered in that way. Do not add qualifiers or dates to the husband&rsquo;s name in this
type of heading, even though they may have been added to the established form
of his own heading (cf. LCRI 22.18A, exception 2, Feb. 1, 1989). If dates are to be
added to the wife&rsquo;s heading, add them following &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>22.16. ADDITIONS TO NAMES ENTERED UNDER GIVEN NAME, ETC.
</p>
<p>22.16A. Royalty
</p>
<p>Correlate this rule with provisions of 22.8 that cover entry of persons under given
name. The name will be given as it appears in English-language reference sources
(cf. 22.3B3) and will include any roman numerals, recorded in subfield &Dagger;b, ap-
pearing with the name in these sources. The title, recorded in subfield &Dagger;c, will be
in English if there is an English equivalent (see figure 15-46). Do not include epi-
thets or the word &ldquo;saint.&rdquo; Royalty takes precedence over all other titles.
</p>
<p>The form for the Prussian king Frederick the Great illustrates provisions of
the rule. Despite the fact that German-language reference sources such as Der grosse
Brockhaus (Wiesbaden: Brockhaus, 1952&ndash;63) list him as &ldquo;Friedrich II, der Grosse,&rdquo;
his name is to be established according to the form found in English-language
sources. Encyclopaedia Britannica (2002) lists him as monarch of Prussia, and gives
his name, with dates, as &ldquo;Frederick II, byname Frederick the Great, German
Friedrich der Grosse.&rdquo; The English form of the name will be used, without epithets
(see 22.16A2). Give references from the name by which he is commonly known in
his home country and from forms with the epithet (see figure 15-47).

<p>22.16A3. Consorts of royal persons. Appropriate title, as well as the phrase
&ldquo;consort of&rdquo; and the name of the ruler, will be given for consorts of rulers. Prince
Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and consort of Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain, is
an example of such a name. Encyclopedia Americana (2001) lists him as &ldquo;Philip,
Duke of Edinburgh and consort of Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&rdquo; He is also referred to in the article as &ldquo;Prince
Philip, the duke of Edinburgh.&rdquo; Thus, he has two titles, Prince and Duke of
Edinburgh. The cataloger should list him by his higher title, Prince. See figure 1-37
for an example, with Philip as author.

<p>In the example shown in figure 15-48, added entry is made for the consort,

<p>22.16B. Popes
</p>
<p>A pope assumes a new name when he is elevated to the papacy. This name should
be used, rather than his secular name, because it is the name by which he is com-
monly known. By the terms of 22.3B3, a person entered under given name whose
name has become well established in an English-language form will be entered
under this form, as found in English-language reference sources.
</p>
<p>Pope John Paul II is listed in Encyclopaedia Britannica (2002) as &ldquo;John Paul II,&rdquo;
with date of birth, his secular name, and his Latin name. By terms of 26.2A, ref-
erences should be made as shown in the authority record. In addition, a &ldquo;search
also under&rdquo; reference is made in a 510 field from his corporate name. Catalog
entry will be as shown in figure 15-49.
</p>
<p>Note that even though John Paul&rsquo;s secular and literary works are normally
published under his secular name, for purposes of personal authorship all of his
works are entered under John Paul. This is not a case of &ldquo;separate bibliographic
identities&rdquo; (22.2B2), because neither name is a pseudonym.</p>

<p>22.16C. Bishops, etc.

<p>Add the title, in English if possible, after the name of a high ecclesiastical official
who is entered under given name (see figure 15-50). Note that bishops, etc., who are
also saints are entered under 22.13, not 22.16C.
</p>
<p>The cataloger will not add the designation after the name of a cardinal, bishop,
etc., who is entered under surname. See for an example figure 1-44. Although
Cardinal Newman consistently used his ecclesiastical title in his later writings,
and although he is commonly known as Cardinal Newman, the fact that he is
entered under surname means that his ecclesiastical title will not be retained in
the heading.

</p>
<p>This rule applies only to persons of religious vocation who are commonly known
by given name and who are thus entered. Add to such a name in the vernacular
terms of honor, address, or title only if the term, etc., appears with the name in the
chief source of information (see LCRI 22.16D, Jan. 5, 1989). If his or her secular
name is known, make a reference from it. Do not add a religious title to the name
of a person of religious vocation who is entered under surname. Figure 15-51 is

<p>Dates (year of birth, death, etc.) will be added following a comma in subfield &Dagger;d to

</p>
<p>According to the option in 22.17, dates may be added to personal names even
when there is no need to distinguish between headings. The Library of Congress,
the National Library of Canada, and the National Library of Australia all apply
this option when the dates are readily ascertainable (LCRI 22.17, Nov. 1998; NLCRI
22.17; NLARI 22.17).

<p>22.18. FULLER FORMS
</p>
<p>One of the objects of the catalog is to provide a distinctive and uniform heading
for each author represented in the library&rsquo;s collection. When two authors in the
catalog have identical names, a &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; exists that must be resolved. The problem
of &ldquo;conflicts&rdquo; in the catalog has been solved in various ways by the older cata-
loging codes. For example, consider the popular author T. H. White. ALA 1949
rule 36 stipulated the use of the author&rsquo;s name in full, with a search made for fore-
names represented by initials. Dates were added when available. Thus, regardless
of whether the catalog included another author of the same name or not, White
would have been searched and established as:
</p>
<p>White, Terence Hanbury, 1906-1964
</p>
<p>Few library users know T. H. White&rsquo;s forenames; the addition of such information
often served to complicate rather than to solve problems of catalog use, particu-
larly with a common name such as White. The next code, AACR1, brought a dis-
tinct improvement with rule 40 being almost the same as AACR2 rule 22.1A,
calling for entry under the name &ldquo;by which [the person] is commonly identified.&rdquo;

<p>The provision seemed sensible. However, AACR1 rule 43A stipulated the use

clearly preferring to use initials on other works. Additionally, 43B directed the</p>

<p>cataloger &ldquo;always [to] spell out a first forename represented by an initial if the
surname is a common one.&rdquo; Thus, T. H. White would have been established
</p>
<p>White, Terence H., 1906-1964
</p>
<p>It seemed to critics of AACR1 that this violated the spirit of the code, because
it disregarded the author&rsquo;s preference and usage. The rationale behind the provi-
sion was that although the catalog may not now contain another A. S. Jones or T. J.
Smith (or other author with common surname), eventually a conflict may arise.
Better to resolve it now than recatalog later. Against such a spirit of &ldquo;borrowing
trouble,&rdquo; Michael Gorman said that the rule &ldquo;represents a failure of nerve, a
failure to carry through the logical consequence of the general rule.&rdquo;10
</p>
<p>The problem of constructing an entry under the commonly known form of
the author&rsquo;s name for a person whose name consists of or contains initials has
been solved in a highly satisfactory manner under 22.18. If no conflict exists in the
catalog, the cataloger will establish such a person according to the provisions of
22.1 under the name by which he or she is commonly known (e.g., White, T. H.).
If necessary to distinguish between identical names in the library&rsquo;s catalog, the
cataloger will add full forenames (or the entire name in direct order, as appropri-
ate) in parentheses following the initials. This &ldquo;qualifier&rdquo; is preceded by subfield
&Dagger;q in the MARC record. White, T. H. (figure 15-52), will be qualified as
</p>
<p>White, T. H. (Terence Hanbury), 1906-1964
</p>
<p>In searching for the forenames, dates of birth are often found as well. The
national libraries will apply the optional provision of 22.17 and add dates of birth
to these headings (cf. discussion at 22.17).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S 413
</p>
<p>Optionally, a library may make additions according to provisions of 22.18 to
all names containing initials, whether a conflict exists or not. The national librar-
ies&rsquo; unanimous position on this option is the same as is their practice in the matter
of adding dates of birth, death, etc., to an author&rsquo;s name. Except to resolve a con-
flict, the cataloger should not search reference sources to try to find information
about an author&rsquo;s forenames (etc.) represented by initials. Use the information as
it appears in the chief source of information. But if further information is &ldquo;readily
available&rdquo; it seems only sensible to add it (LCRI 22.18A, Jan. 5, 1989; NLCRI 22.18;
NLARI 22.18). Thus, if the cataloger knows further information about T. H. White&rsquo;s
name, this will be used, regardless of whether a conflict exists or not. Reference
will be made from the fuller form of the name, as shown in the authority record.
</p>
<p>This technique can also be used in certain cases that are not expansions of
forenames represented by initials. For example, Oliphant, Mrs., will become
Oliphant, Mrs. (Margaret), 1828-1897 (see figure 1-40).
</p>
<p>Mrs. Oliphant&rsquo;s authority record will be formulated as follows:
</p>
<p>100 1 &Dagger;a Oliphant, &Dagger;c Mrs. &Dagger;q (Margaret), &Dagger;d 1828-1897
</p>
<p>400 1 &Dagger;a Oliphant, Margaret, &Dagger;d 1828-1897
</p>
<p>The reference from the fuller form displays:
</p>
<p>Oliphant, Margaret, 1828-1897
search under
</p>
<p>Oliphant, Mrs. (Margaret), 1828-1897
</p>
<p>22.19. DISTINGUISHING TERMS
</p>
<p>Obviously, if a person&rsquo;s name is the same as another name in the catalog, the cat-
aloger will need to make every reasonable effort to provide dates, or a fuller form
of name, if not for the new heading, then for the existing one. But if the cataloger
cannot find either of these elements to resolve a conflict, a suitable, brief descrip-
tive designation may be added. More leeway about terminology is given in the
case of names entered under given name; when distinguishing between two
names entered under surname, the rule stipulates that the cataloger is to confine
distinguishing terms to statements appearing on the title page of the work cata-
loged or taken from reference sources (see LCRI 22.19, Nov. 1995, for details). This
rule is used only in the few cases in which a conflict cannot otherwise be resolved.
</p>
<p>22.20. UNDIFFERENTIATED NAMES
</p>
<p>If no addition can be found to break the conflict, 22.20A permits the cataloger to
use the same heading for all persons with the same name (such headings are
called &ldquo;undifferentiated names&rdquo;). According to AACR2 rules, this is a solution
only to be used as a last resort. However, in deciding whether to use an undiffer-
entiated name or to attempt to qualify it in some way, the cataloger should con-
sider the effect of qualifying the heading on the index. Sometimes artificial qual-
ifiers such as those suggested by AACR2 22.19 serve only to cause a heading,
particularly if it is a common one, to be lost in the index when a user attempts to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>414 HE A D I N G S F O R PE R S O N S
</p>
<p>find it. Will the user be able to guess that the Johannes he or she wants is filed
under &ldquo;N&rdquo; for &ldquo;Notary,&rdquo; or that George Brown is filed under &ldquo;C&rdquo; for &ldquo;Captain&rdquo;
(cf. the examples to AACR2 22.19)? If not, it may be better to leave the name
undifferentiated under rule 22.20.

<p>23.1. INTRODUCTORY NOTE
</p>
<p>Geographic names are needed to represent governments as headings (24.3E); in
addition, many government bodies are entered subordinately to such geographic
names (24.17&ndash;24.26). Other geographic names are used to differentiate between
identical corporate names (24.4C). AACR2 chapter 23 gives guidance about the
form of name that should be used. Chapter 23 is quite short, mainly because most
geographic names, for descriptive cataloging purposes at least, are identical to the
names of governments. Since governments are corporate bodies, most of the rules
for the formation of their headings are found in chapter 24.
</p>
<p>23.2. GENERAL RULES
</p>
<p>The English form of geographic name is to be used, rather than the form used by
residents of the place, if there is a common English form. In some cases this
instruction may prove to be a barrier to international exchange of cataloging
information, but it is an easy and satisfactory rule for English-language libraries.
It will certainly lead to a &ldquo;sought&rdquo; heading in such libraries. Note the examples
under 23.2A1.
</p>
<p>The heading &ldquo;Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&rdquo; will not be used by the
Library of Congress. LC will use the short form, &ldquo;Soviet Union.&rdquo; The republics of
the former Soviet Union are now established independently under their own
names. Another important decision: the Library of Congress will use &ldquo;Great
Britain&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; everywhere this heading appears (includ-
ing qualifiers and titles for monarchs) (LCRI 23.2, &ldquo;Special decisions&rdquo; 3 and 6, Feb.
2002).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23.4. ADDITIONS
</p>
<p>With certain exceptions, the cataloger is instructed to add to the name of a place
the name of a larger place, as instructed in specific rules. This addition will be
made in parentheses. Use abbreviations as found in Appendix B.14 when making
the addition: for example, New York (N.Y.). However, if the name of the larger
place qualifier is not found in B.14, do not abbreviate: for example, London
(England).
</p>
<p>Do not qualify the name of a country or of a state, province, etc., in the United
States, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Soviet Union, or Yugoslavia by adding the
name of a larger place. For example, United States stands without a qualifier. So
do the states of the United States: Arizona. (Note that the cataloger uses the abbre-
viations found in B.14 only when using these terms as geographic qualifiers. Spell
out Arizona when using the name as a geographic heading.)
</p>
<p>An exception to the above directions: if a state (etc.) has a name that is the
same as that of a city (etc.), the name of the state will be qualified by a term that
indicates the jurisdiction. For example, New York (State) (see AACR2 24.6B for
instructions).
</p>
<p>23.4D. Places in the British Isles
</p>
<p>Under AACR2 (1978) catalogers were instructed to add the name of a county in
the British Isles to names of cities in England, Wales, or the Republic of Ireland.
For catalogers outside of the British Isles, this rule was difficult to apply and led
to headings that were cumbersome and less than helpful to library users. The rule
has been modified under AACR2. If a place is located in England, Ireland,
Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, or the Channel Islands, add
one of those terms as appropriate (see examples under 23.4D2).
</p>
<p>23.4E. Other places
</p>
<p>For places not covered in the discussion above, add the name of the country, for
example, Paris (France) or Helsinki (Finland). In case of conflict between identi-
cal place names formulated under 23.4E, make further additions to the qualifier
as instructed in 23.4F or 24.6B.

</p>
<p>Once the cataloger has determined, according to AACR2 chapter 21, that a cor-
porate body is to serve as either main or added entry in a catalog, the proper form
of the name remains to be decided. In many respects the chapter giving rules for
corporate names parallels that for personal headings. Each chapter starts with a
general rule (22.1 for personal headings, 24.1 for corporate headings). The princi-
ple behind each rule is the same: enter either the person or the corporate body
under the name most likely to be known by the library user (i.e., the heading by
which it is commonly identified).1
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Practice
</p>
<p>As discussed in Handbook chapter 15, the Library of Congress has designated
certain pre-AACR2 headings which were not formulated according to AACR2 to
be &ldquo;AACR2 compatible.&rdquo; While such headings are not used in the figures in this
Handbook, the cataloger should be aware of them. They include the following:
</p>
<p>Quotation marks: the heading omits quotation marks that would be
present under AACR2.
</p>
<p>Acronyms: the heading contains a lowercase acronym where the body&rsquo;s
predominant usage is uppercase.
</p>
<p>Terms of incorporation: the heading contains a term of incorporation (e.g.,
inc.), which either is not capitalized according to AACR2 or would
not have been retained; or it lacks a term of incorporation that
would have been retained.
</p>
<p>For more information, see LCRI 24.1, Feb. 2002. As pointed out in Handbook
chapter 15, no other national library accepts the Library of Congress&rsquo;s &ldquo;AACR2
compatible&rdquo; forms.

<p>24.1. GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>With certain exceptions that are necessary because of the complexity of corporate
structure and that are treated later in the rules, the cataloger is to enter a corpo-
rate body directly under the name by which it is commonly identified. This rule
is exactly parallel to its counterpart, 22.1, for personal headings. Both rules are
based on the principle that the name that will be selected will be the name by
which the entity identifies itself.
</p>
<p>As with a personal heading (22.1B), the cataloger will determine the &ldquo;common&rdquo;
form of name from works issued by the corporate body in its own language (see
figure 17-1). Note, however, the form in this figure. In languages such as German
that have case endings, the name is always established in the nominative case.
Hence, this body&rsquo;s name is established as &ldquo;Deutsches Bucharchiv M&uuml;nchen,&rdquo; not
&ldquo;Deutschen Bucharchiv M&uuml;nchen.&rdquo;

<p>The rule for a corporate body that consists of or contains initials parallels the
stipulations of AACR2 1.1B6. Do not leave a space between initials, or between a
full stop and a following initial. Include or omit full stops between initials accord-
ing to the body&rsquo;s usage. However, precede or follow abbreviations consisting of
two or more letters with a space (e.g., W. Va.; Ph. D. Associates) (LCRI 24.1, Nov.
1995). See figure 17-2 for an example of a corporate heading that contains initials.
</p>
<p>24.1C. Changes of name
</p>
<p>This rule is the same as AACR1 rule 68. The AACR1 rule was an important
change from ALA 1949 rules 91 and 92, which called for entry of societies and
institutions under the latest form of name. The ALA rules, which were similar to
AACR2 22.2C for personal names, served, as does 22.2C for personal authors, to
bring together in one place in the catalog all of the publications of a corporate
body, no matter how many names it had used during the course of its history.
However, it remained for Seymour Lubetzky, in his Cataloging Rules and Principles,
to point out that corporate bodies as authors are not at all like personal authors.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>HE A D I N G S F O R CO R P O R AT E BO D I E S 419
</p>
<p>A person, even though he or she may change names, remains the same person.
On the other hand, said Lubetzky,
</p>
<p>The life of a corporate body may be considerably longer than that of a
personal author and it is always subject to various organizational and
constitutional changes. These changes are normally reflected in changes
in its name. The question arises, therefore, whether a body whose name
has been changed should be regarded, for purposes of entry, as the same
body or as a different body.2
</p>
<p>The present rules take the position that a corporate body that has changed its
name is, indeed, a different entity. Entry will be made under successive names

</p>
<p>24.2. VARIANT NAMES. GENERAL RULES
</p>
<p>24.2A. As long as the name of a corporate body appears in a consistent form in its
publications, the name is to be used as it appears. But sometimes a corporate
body, although it has not changed its name, lists it in different forms in its publi-
cations. Rules 24.2&ndash;24.3 give guidance about which of the varying forms to choose
as heading. Caution: these rules are to be used to establish the name in the
library&rsquo;s authority file. Once the name has been so established, the cataloger
should always use the form found there no matter how the name appears in the
item in hand, unless there is strong evidence that the form in the authority file is
incorrect, in which case both the authority record and all associated bibliographic
records should be changed.
</p>
<p>24.2B. Prefer the form of a corporate name that is found in the chief source of
information (e.g., the title page of a book) rather than forms found elsewhere in
the item (the verso of the title page, a page preceding the title page, the cover, the
running title, etc.). The book cataloged in figure 17-3 is an example of this rule.
The name American Philosophical Society appears on the title page (chief source).
The half title (page preceding the title page) lists the society&rsquo;s full name, American
Philosophical Society Held at Philadelphia for Promoting Useful Knowledge. The
cataloger will choose the title-page form for entry.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>HE A D I N G S F O R CO R P O R AT E BO D I E S 421
</p>
<p>24.2D. If the chief source of information gives the name in more than one
form, prefer a &ldquo;formal&rdquo; presentation (i.e., at the head of the title, in the imprint, in
the statement of responsibility) rather than another form, such as might be pre-
sented in the title of the work. If both the full form and an initialism or acronym
appear formally, following Library of Congress policy the cataloger will choose
the full form for the heading (LCRI 24.2D, Jan. 5, 1989). U.S. catalogers will follow
this practice rather than that prescribed by AACR2 24.2D (see figure 17-4).

</p>
<p>In regard to corporate bodies such as ERIC and Unesco, note that the cata-
loger will establish the name or references to the name with capitalization accord-
ing to the body&rsquo;s preference (e.g., ERIC consistently appears in all capital letters;
Unesco, in contrast, is written as a word, with an initial capital and the rest low-
ercase letters) (see figure 17-5). See also the AACR2 24.7B4 example, Conference
&ldquo;Systematics of the Old World Monkeys&rdquo;; if the name of a corporate body is con-
sistently presented with all or part of its name in quotation marks, the quotation
marks will be retained (LCRI 24.1, &ldquo;Punctuation,&rdquo; Feb. 2002).
</p>
<p>Sometimes the brief form of the name used by a corporate body in some of its
publications is the same as the name of another organization, or it does not
provide adequate identification for cataloging. If this is the case, the last para-
graph of 24.2D directs the cataloger to use the form found in reference sources or
&ldquo;the official form.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The National Research Council of Canada sometimes is so listed in its publi-
cations; sometimes it appears as National Research Council. The brief form is not
sufficient to identify the body, because there is another organization of the same
name based in Washington, D.C. World of Learning (London: Allen &amp; Unwin,
1947&ndash; ) gives the official form of the Canadian body as National Research Council
of Canada.
</p>
<p>This is the form, rather than the brief form, that will be used for entry (see
figure 1-96).
</p>
<p>24.3. VARIANT NAMES. SPECIAL RULES
</p>
<p>24.3A. Language
</p>
<p>When the name of a corporate body appears in its publications in different lan-
guages, the official language of the body is used for the heading. In countries such
as Canada, where there is more than one official language, if one of the languages
is English, use the English-language form. The Canadian School Library Associa-
tion is an example of such a corporate body (see figure 17-6).
</p>
<p>None of the national libraries issuing rule interpretations applies the alterna-
tive rule (footnote 7).
</p>
<p>24.3B. Language. International bodies
</p>
<p>Use the English form, if one exists, for works issued by an international body (see,
for example, the International Federation of Library Associations, figure 2-11).
</p>
<p>24.3C. Conventional name
</p>
<p>24.3C2. Ancient and international bodies. This rule is limited to bodies of ancient
origin or those international in character with names that have become established
in an English form in English-language usage. With a directive that is analogous
to that given in 22.3B3 for a similar situation, the cataloger is told to enter such a
body in the English-language form of its name. Check English-language reference
sources to determine the name when in doubt.
</p>
<p>The Council of Trent is such a body. It is listed in Encyclopedia Americana
(2001) and New Catholic Encyclopedia (2003) as the &ldquo;Council of Trent.&rdquo; The heading</p>

<p>for this body will be the one found in these sources (see figure 17-7). References
will be made from its original Latin name and its name entered subordinately to
its parent body, the Catholic Church. The references in the 4XX fields of the
authority record will display:

<p>As with other ancient and international bodies, the English-language form should
be chosen for entry. The Redemptorists are such a body. Although they originated
in Italy, they should be entered in the conventional English form rather than the
language of their country of origin. Encyclopaedia Britannica (2002) lists them as

<p>&ldquo;Redemptorists,&rdquo; and also as &ldquo;Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer,&rdquo; as well
as &ldquo;C. SS. R.&rdquo; The title page of figure 17-8 has a Latin form. All these forms should
be given as 4XX cross-references in the authority record. Note that as in all lan-
guages that decline nouns (see figure 17-1 and corresponding text), Latin names
should be given in headings and references in the nominative case only, not nec-
essarily in the case in which they appear in the source. In this case, references are
made for &ldquo;Congregatio . . .&rdquo; not &ldquo;Congregationi . . .&rdquo; (as the name appears on the
title page).
</p>
<p>24.3E. Governments
</p>
<p>If the name of a government appears in varying forms, use the conventional name
rather than the official name. Thus, the cataloger will use &ldquo;France&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;R&eacute;publique Fran&ccedil;aise.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>A word of caution: because a government is regarded as a corporate body, if
its name changes, following 24.1C the cataloger will use the heading appropriate
to the date of the original issue of a publication. Note, however, the LC decision,

<p>based on British Library practice, regarding the British Isles. Although the name
&ldquo;Great Britain&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; in 1801, &ldquo;Great Britain&rdquo; will con-
tinue to be used as the name of the government (see LCRI 23.2, &ldquo;Special decision
3,&rdquo; Feb. 2002).
</p>
<p>The opposite problem occurs when the jurisdiction changes but the name
remains the same. The Library of Congress instructs its catalogers to use one
heading for all jurisdictions in such a situation (LCRI 24.6, Aug. 1997). The book
cataloged in figure 17-9 emanates from the territory of Utah and was published
three decades before Utah became a state. Nevertheless, it is entered under &ldquo;Utah,&rdquo;
not &ldquo;Utah (Territory).&rdquo;

ences, see the discussion in this Handbook under 24.7.

<p>24.3G. Local churches, etc.
</p>
<p>Use the name of the church as it appears in its publications in the chief source of
information. If the name varies, use the predominant form. If there is no predom-
inant form, choose a name according to order of preference as given under 24.3G.
For examples and discussion of the entire rule, see under 24.10 in this Handbook.
</p>
<p>Additions, Omissions, and Modifications
</p>
<p>The foregoing rules have dealt with basic problems of entry. The basic rule is con-
structed on the same principle as that governing personal names: use the name by
which the body is commonly identified. If this name changes, see 24.1C for guid-
ance. If, without actually changing its name, the body uses varying forms of the
same name in its publications, 24.2&ndash;24.3 give directions for choosing among vary-
ing forms. But sometimes the name of the body as it appears in its publications is
the same as that of another corporate body. Sometimes the name as it appears
does not clearly give the idea that it belongs to a corporate body. Other problems
may also enter into the formation of corporate headings that necessitate addi-
tions, omissions, and modifications of the name. The following rules give guid-
ance in such cases.

</p>
<p>All additions to corporate names will be enclosed in parentheses.
</p>
<p>24.4B. Names not conveying the idea of a corporate body
</p>
<p>For such bodies, in a ruling analogous to that for the addition of distinguishing
terms to personal names (22.19), a suitable general designation or qualification
will be added, simply for clarification. The example given in figure 17-10 includes
entries for two ships, &ldquo;Mascarin&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marquis de Castries.&rdquo; Neither of these
names sounds particularly like that of a corporate body. Therefore, a general des-
ignation &ldquo;Ship&rdquo; should be added.
</p>
<p>Note the last example given under 24.4B1: Friedrich Witte (Firm). Except for
the addition of the qualifying word, it would appear to be a personal name. Use
this form for subjects or for main or added entry headings only, not for the name
of such a firm appearing in the publisher statement.

</p>
<p>The Library of Congress has amplified the rules for adding a general desig-
nation qualifier to a corporate name containing a personal name. When such a
corporate name contains two or more surnames, without forenames or forename
initials, a qualifier need not be added, because such a heading does not resemble
a personal name. LCRI 24.4B (March 2001) contrasts the heading &ldquo;Morgan and
Morgan&rdquo; (no qualifier needed) with &ldquo;B. Morgan and D. Morgan (Firm)&rdquo; (qualifier
needed as the heading could be a pair of personal names).
</p>
<p>24.4C. Two or more bodies with the same or similar names
</p>
<p>24.4C1. General rule. This rule is based on general AACR2 principles for resolv-
ing conflicts in the library catalog. In AACR2 chapter 22, when two persons have
the same name or names so similar that they are likely to be confused, the names
are distinguished by adding dates of birth and death (22.17), by spelling out fore-
names in parentheses (22.18), or by adding a distinguishing term (22.19). Similarly,
to distinguish between corporate bodies with identical or similar names, a word
or phrase will be added to each name.
</p>
<p>In many instances, qualifiers will also be added to corporate headings even
when they do not conflict. The rule states, &ldquo;Add such a word or phrase to any
other name if the addition assists in the understanding of the nature or purpose
of the body.&rdquo; A long-standing (pre-AACR2) distinction regarding qualification of
government bodies that are &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; and those that are not is embodied in
the LCRI to this rule.
</p>
<p>Government bodies. If, according to AACR2 24.17, a government body is to be
entered directly under its own name rather than as a unit subordinate to the name
of the government (see discussion under 24.17), the cataloger will add the name
of the government as a qualifier (see LCRI 24.4C, &ldquo;non-conflicts 1b,&rdquo; Feb. 11, 1992;
see figure 17-4). Use abbreviations authorized by AACR2 Appendix B.14.
</p>
<p>Exceptions: a qualifier is not added to a subordinate government body
entered under its own name (24.17) if
</p>
<p>1. The name of the government (or an understandable surrogate) is already
present in the name. See, for example, figure 17-11 (Arts Council of Great
Britain).
</p>
<p>2. The government body is an institution (school, library, laboratory, hospital,
archive, museum, prison, etc.).
</p>
<p>Thus, the heading &ldquo;Library of Congress&rdquo; needs no qualifier (see figure 14-5).
Nor does the name of a state university such as the University of Arizona or
Arizona State University&mdash;as long as the name has not been replicated, or as long
as it is not likely to be. State university systems with schools in many locations,
such as the University of California, generally do not need qualifiers either,
because the local place name is normally a part of the name of the branch of the
university, as &ldquo;University of California, Irvine&rdquo; (figure 17-12; compare the form of
the name on the title page with the established heading).
</p>
<p>All other corporate bodies. Add a qualifier to names of nongovernment bodies
or government institutions (schools, libraries, etc.) when such names are entered
directly &ldquo;if the addition assists in the understanding of the nature or purpose of
the body&rdquo; (24.4C1). In a full discussion of this rule, the Library of Congress has</p>

<p>stated that &ldquo;the use of the undefinable phrase &lsquo;nature or purpose&rsquo; is deliberate,
with the intention of letting the cataloger judge the situation&mdash;does the addition
of a qualifier really improve the heading? In case of doubt, do not add the quali-
fier&rdquo; (LCRI 24.4C, &ldquo;non-conflicts 2a,&rdquo; Feb. 11, 1992).
</p>
<p>Such exercise of &ldquo;cataloger judgment&rdquo; will lead to variations in headings.
Catalogers may or may not choose to be influenced by such factors as the dis-
tinctiveness of a nonconflicting corporate body&rsquo;s name (a corporate name is dis-
tinctive if it includes a personal name or if it includes a geographic term or place
name). If it seems useful to show the location of the body, the name of the city or
town in which the body is located may be added (see, for example, figures 17-13
and 17-14). Note that when local place name is added, its catalog entry form
should be used as shown in 23.4A1, second example. This means that even if the
established heading contains the name of the larger geographic entity, the name of
the town or city will be qualified by the larger entity. Abbreviation should be used
for the larger entity if found in Appendix B.14 (see LCRI 24.4C, &ldquo;non-conflicts 2c,&rdquo;
May 19, 1994). Thus, Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum (Tucson, Ariz.) will be the
heading rather than Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum (Tucson) (figure 17-14).

<p>Particularly if a nonconflicting corporate heading is not &ldquo;distinctive,&rdquo; the cat-
aloger may choose to add a local place name qualifier (see figure 1-34 for an
example of a nondistinctive corporate name that might be so qualified).
</p>
<p>Although the local place name is perhaps the most frequently used qualifier,
the cataloger may choose to qualify a corporate heading by the name of a larger
place or jurisdiction that reflects the scope of the body&rsquo;s activities. Thus, in figure
17-15, Great Britain has been added as a qualifier to the heading Folklore Society.
</p>
<p>In many instances, AACR2 24.12 calls for direct entry of a nongovernment
subordinate body (see discussion under 24.12). If in the cataloger&rsquo;s judgment a
qualifier is needed, the name of the higher or related body will normally be added
as the qualifier. The Student Society for Ancient Studies is such a body. The name
of the higher body (Brigham Young University) will be used as the qualifier (see
figure 17-16).</p>

<p>In summary, the cataloger will add a qualifier (with exceptions noted in dis-
cussion above) to the headings for subordinate government bodies entered directly
under their own names. For nongovernment headings, except in the case of a con-
flict with another identical or similar heading in the catalog, the cataloger will
add a qualifier &ldquo;if the addition assists in the understanding of the nature or
purpose of the body&rdquo; or if such an addition provides useful information. The
Library of Congress advises that, in case of doubt, the cataloger should not add
the qualifier (LCRI 24.4C, &ldquo;non-conflicts 2a,&rdquo; Feb. 11, 1992). Normally, a qualifier
will not be added to the name of an international organization (e.g., International
Federation of Library Associations). A national association with a distinctive
name will not be qualified (e.g., American Library Association; National Council
of Teachers of English). In instances where the rules do not provide specific guid-
ance, the question should be: does the addition of a qualifier clarify or in some
other way improve the heading? If not, it probably should not be added.
</p>
<p>24.5. OMISSIONS
</p>
<p>24.5A. Initial articles
</p>
<p>Omit an initial article unless the heading is to file under the article. Thus, the
name &ldquo;The University of Michigan&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;University of Michigan&rdquo;; &ldquo;The
School With No Name&rdquo; (figure 17-13) becomes &ldquo;School With No Name.&rdquo; However,
&ldquo;La Jolla (Calif.),&rdquo; because the name of this city files under the article, retains the
article in the heading.
</p>
<p>24.5C. Terms indicating incorporation and certain other terms
</p>
<p>In most instances, terms indicating incorporation will be omitted from the
heading for a corporate body (see Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, figure 17-14).
</p>
<p>If such a term is necessary to make it clear that the name is that of a corporate
body, however, include the term (see figure 17-18). If the term indicating incor-
poration cannot be omitted, follow the punctuation and capitalization customar-
ily used by the corporate body, either including or omitting the comma preceding
the term, as appropriate (see figure 17-19).
</p>
<p>24.6. GOVERNMENTS. ADDITIONS
</p>
<p>24.6A1. Names of governments are used for official publications of the govern-
ment. See AACR2 chapter 23 for general discussion on establishing the name of a
government. In some instances, the name of a government requires further dif-
ferentiation from another identical name than that prescribed in chapter 23. This
rule gives guidance on further additions the cataloger may make.
</p>
<p>24.6B. When further differentiation is needed, add the type of jurisdiction in
English in parentheses following the heading:
</p>
<p>Washington (State)
</p>
<p>Washington (D.C.)</p>

<p>24.7. CONFERENCES, CONGRESSES, MEETINGS, ETC.
</p>
<p>A conference, workshop, institute, etc., is a meeting convened &ldquo;for the purpose of
discussing and/or acting on topics of common interest&rdquo; (AACR2, Appendix D
[Glossary]). By terms of 21.1B2d, a named conference may be the main entry for
works that record the collective activity of the conference (e.g., its proceedings or
collected papers).
</p>
<p>Before making main entry under the name of a conference, the cataloger must
determine whether the conference is a named conference. AACR1 included guide-
lines that may still be helpful to the cataloger in deciding whether a conference
has a name. According to these guidelines (p. 134), &ldquo;A conference is considered to
have a name if the words referring to it partake more of the character of a specific
appellation than of a general description. Such factors as capitalization of initial
letters, consistency in wording, and the use of the definite article in references to
the conference in the text are evidence supporting the presence of a name&rdquo; (see
also LCRI 21.1B1, Feb. 2001). Thus, the workshop-conference cataloged under
figure 17-12 is not regarded as having a name, nor is the symposium in figure 
17-20. In contrast, see figure 14-6 for an example of a named conference. Named</p>

<p>conferences entered directly under the name are recorded in MARC field X11,
with the name in subfield &Dagger;a.
</p>
<p>The concept of a named conference has been expanded by AACR2 to include
generic terms, so long as the generic-term name &ldquo;designates a meeting of a body
(as opposed to one merely sponsored by a body)&rdquo; (LCRI 21.1B1, Feb. 2001). Gen-
erically named meetings of a corporate body will be entered as a conference
heading subordinate to the heading for the corporate body (see figure 17-21).
Because such meetings are entered subordinately to the corporate body, they will
be recorded in MARC field X10; the generic term will follow the name of the body,
preceded by full stop - subfield &Dagger;b.
</p>
<p>Title page
</p>
<p>Many conferences do not include the word &ldquo;conference&rdquo; as part of their name.
In addition, a smaller seminar, symposium, conference, etc., held in conjunction
with a larger meeting may be treated as a corporate body if it is a &ldquo;named&rdquo; meeting,
according to AACR2 21.1B (see figure 17-22).
</p>
<p>24.7A. Omissions
</p>
<p>The number of the conference is omitted from the name and given in parentheses
as the first addition to the name of the conference (24.7B2) (see figure 17-23). Also
omitted are terms indicating frequency (e.g., &ldquo;annual,&rdquo; etc.) or date of convocation.
</p>
<p>24.7B. Additions

<p>24.7B1. Additions must be in the following order: number of conference, year, and
place. The entire addition is enclosed within parentheses, and elements are sepa-
rated by space - colon - space.</p>

<p>24.7B2. Number. If a conference has a number, it is the first of the additions
that follow the name of the conference (see figure 17-23). The English ordinal
number is recorded in subfield &Dagger;n, following the opening parenthesis. Not all con-
ferences are numbered. Simply omit this element if the conference has no number
(cf. figure 17-22). Note, however, that a number may be inferred when informa-
tion available to the cataloger clearly indicates the position of the meeting within
a series of meetings of the same name.
</p>
<p>If a conference is an ongoing one (e.g., numbered, occurring biennially, etc.),
the Library of Congress will only make a single authority record for the name of
the conference, and not make separate authority records for the individual con-
ferences (LCRI 24.7B, Feb. 2001). Other libraries are free to make separate author-
ity records locally if they desire.
</p>
<p>24.7B3. Date. In almost all cases, the date to be added is the year only (see
figure 17-24). This is recorded in subfield &Dagger;d. Add specific dates as shown in the
last example under 24.7B3 in AACR2 only if more than one conference of the
same name was held in the same year. Such a coincidence will occur only rarely.

<p>24.7B4. Location. The last element added to the name of the conference, etc., is
local place or the institution where the conference was held, recorded in subfield
&Dagger;c. An &ldquo;institution&rdquo; includes such organizations as schools, libraries, museums,
hospitals, etc. A hotel or other similar meeting place is not an institution. If an
institution&rsquo;s name appears with the name of the conference in the source from
which the conference name was taken, use the institution&rsquo;s name as the qualifier
(see figure 14-6). Otherwise prefer the name of the local place where the confer-
ence was held (see figure 17-24; LCRI 24.7B, Feb. 2001).
</p>
<p>A final word of caution regarding conferences: if a conference does not have
a name, treat the publication as though no conference were involved. The example
shown in figure 17-25 is an unnamed conference sponsored by the Graduate
Library School, University of Chicago. The meeting has a generic-term name
(annual conference) but is not a meeting of the Library School (in spite of the
wording), but rather &ldquo;one merely sponsored&rdquo; by it. The nature of the contents of
the publication excludes it from consideration as a work to be entered under the
heading for the Graduate Library School (see 21.1B2). Instead, it should be
regarded as a work by different persons or bodies (21.7B), to be entered under title.

</p>
<p>A named exhibition, like a named conference, is regarded as the author of its pub-
lications that fall within the scope of 21.1B2d. Rules for exhibitions parallel those
for conferences in elements to be added to the name of the exhibition, etc. (see
figure 14-11 for an example of a named exhibition). Despite the wording of
AACR2 24.8B1, the Library of Congress adds date as a qualifier even if it is a part
of the name (LCRI 24.8B, Jan. 5, 1989).

<p>Subordinate and Related Bodies
</p>
<p>In many respects the rules governing corporate bodies are analogous to those for
personal authors. But in one important respect corporate bodies are unlike per-
sonal authors: corporate bodies may have subdivisions, units subordinate or
related in some way to the parent body. When dealing with a subordinate body,
one of two options is open to the cataloger:
</p>
<p>1. If the name of the subordinate body is of such a nature that it implies sub-
ordination, the subordinate body will be entered as a subheading under
the name of the higher body to which it is related (24.13).

</p>
<p>2. If the subordinate body has a distinctive name that is sufficient to identify
it in the catalog, it will be entered as an independent unit under its own
name (24.12).
</p>
<p>24.12. GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>This rule is actually only a restatement of the general rule governing headings for
corporate bodies (24.1). If a subordinate body has a distinctive, self-sufficient
name that it consistently uses in its publications, enter it directly under that name.
The Student Society for Ancient Studies, at Brigham Young University, has such a
name (see figure 17-16). Note the qualifier, made under the provisions of 24.4C1
(see discussion, Handbook).
</p>
<p>If a subordinate body is entered directly under its own name, 24.12 calls for a
reference from the name of the body as a subheading under the parent organiza-
tion; the reference for figure 17-16, recorded in the second 410 field of its author-
ity record, displays:
</p>
<p>Brigham Young University. Student Society for Ancient Studies
search under
</p>
<p>Student Society for Ancient Studies (Brigham Young University)
</p>
<p>24.13. SUBORDINATE AND RELATED BODIES ENTERED SUBORDINATELY
</p>
<p>This rule enumerates six types of subordinate bodies that are to be entered as sub-
headings under the name of a higher body. These types have their origin in Paris
Principle 9.61, which calls for entry of a corporate body under a higher body &ldquo;if this
name itself implies subordination or subordinate function, or is insufficient to iden-
tify the subordinate body.&rdquo; If the body being entered subordinately includes the
name of the parent body, omit this from the subordinate heading. The parent body
is recorded in subfield &Dagger;a of the X10 field; the subordinate body in subfield &Dagger;b.
</p>
<p>Type 1. A subordinate body whose name includes a word such as &ldquo;depart-
ment,&rdquo; &ldquo;division,&rdquo; etc., or some other word implying that the body is a compo-
nent part of something else will be entered as a subheading under the higher
body. Do not repeat the name of the higher body or any words that link the lower
to the higher body.
</p>
<p>Figure 17-28 includes an example of Type 1, a subordinate body whose name
contains the word &ldquo;department.&rdquo; The Library of Congress, by policy decision,
abbreviates the word &ldquo;Department&rdquo; to &ldquo;Dept.&rdquo; in headings, regardless of the
spelling used by the subordinate body (LCRI, Appendix B.9, Jan. 5, 1989). This is
also the policy of the National Library of Canada (NLCRI chapter 24 introduc-
tion). This abbreviation occurs in the heading only. When transcribing the title and
statement of responsibility area, the cataloger will follow spelling as it is found in
the prescribed source (see figure 17-28; compare the name in the statement of
responsibility with the heading).
</p>
<p>Type 2. If the name of a committee, etc., is worded in such a fashion that it
implies administrative subordination to a higher body, it will be entered as a sub-
heading under the name of the higher body (for an example, see figure 17-29).</p>

<p>The Library of Congress has issued a supplementary list of words in English,
French, and Spanish that normally imply administrative subordination, in addi-
tion to &ldquo;committee&rdquo; and &ldquo;commission&rdquo; as given under AACR2 24.13 Type 2. If a
subordinate body&rsquo;s name includes one of the words on the following list, it is
probably governed by this rule (LCRI 24.13, &ldquo;Type 2,&rdquo; Nov. 1995).

one or more of the words listed above are to be treated according to Type 2 (LCRI

</p>
<p>Type 3. Some subordinate or related bodies have names so general that the
name of a higher body is needed for identification. The Library of Congress inter-
prets &ldquo;general in nature&rdquo; to mean containing neither distinctive elements (e.g.,

the higher body. On the other hand, by the Library of Congress definition, &ldquo;Fine

entered directly (probably with qualifiers) (LCRI 24.13, &ldquo;Type 3,&rdquo; Jan. 5, 1989).

<p>Type 4. Occasionally the name of a subordinate unit does not suggest the idea
that it is a corporate body at all. Referring to the examples in AACR2, &ldquo;Collection
Development&rdquo; and &ldquo;Corporate Public Relations&rdquo; sound like concepts or pro-
cesses rather than names of organized units of an institution or corporation.
Although such names are relatively rare, it is well to have them delineated. When
they occur, they will be added as subordinate bodies under the name of the higher
body to which they belong.
</p>
<p>Type 5. As with the headings covered by Type 3, those covered by Type 5
would be incomplete, ambiguous, and insufficient to provide proper identifica-
tion for the subordinate unit if they were entered independently. Type 5 is limited
to names of university schools or colleges that simply are descriptive of the field
of study (see figure 17-20).
</p>
<p>Type 6. If the subordinate body uses in its publication a name that includes the
entire name of the higher body, it will be entered as a subheading under the name
of the higher body. The &ldquo;entire name&rdquo; means the name that was selected for the
heading, excluding additions made by the cataloger, such as qualifiers, etc. (LCRI
24.13, &ldquo;Type 6,&rdquo; Aug. 7, 1991). The name of the higher body is not repeated as part
of the subheading (see figure 17-31).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>HE A D I N G S F O R CO R P O R AT E BO D I E S 447
</p>
<p>Notice two of the examples under the previous rule, AACR2 24.12. &ldquo;BBC
Symphony Orchestra&rdquo; is not a name that includes the entire name of the body
(British Broadcasting Company) and therefore does not fall under 24.13 Type 6.
See also the example &ldquo;Harvard Law School.&rdquo; As with BBC, the name of the Law
School does not include the entire name of the higher body (Harvard University).
Therefore, these subordinate bodies are entered under their own names directly;
a reference is made, however, from the name of the higher body with the lower
body entered subordinately.
</p>
<p>24.14. DIRECT OR INDIRECT SUBHEADING
</p>
<p>Sometimes a corporate body that is to be entered as a subdivision is part of a
whole chain or hierarchy of agencies, each dependent on the one above it. Entry
of the lowest link of the chain, the most subordinate of the subordinate units, can
present problems. Sometimes it is necessary to give the entire hierarchy, as in the
third example under 24.14 in AACR2. In the example, each of the elements in the
hierarchy depends directly on the one above it: &ldquo;Board of Directors&rdquo; is a Type 3
name; &ldquo;Resources and Technical Services Division&rdquo; is a Type 1 name; the board&rsquo;s
name is meaningless without the name of the division to which it is attached; the
division has a name that implies subordination and so it must be attached to that
of the parent organization, American Library Association.
</p>
<p>But as the above example demonstrates, such a practice often results in a very
long heading. More important, over the years the intervening bodies between the
first and last link of the hierarchy may change, or control of the subordinate
agency may be shifted from one higher body to another. When this happens, if all
of the links of the hierarchy have been displayed in the heading, the heading must
be changed. Such a change often means extensive recataloging. Rule 24.14 offers
a good solution to the problem. Enter the subdivision at hand directly under the
first larger body that can stand independently. Leave out the intermediate units as
long as they are not needed to clarify the function of the smaller body. Figure 14-10
is a good example of this practice. The hierarchy for this body, as shown on the
title page of the book, is

<p>The lowest element of the hierarchy that can be entered independently is &ldquo;Ameri-
can Library Association.&rdquo; The name &ldquo;Library Standards for Microfilm Commit-
tee&rdquo; is not likely to be used by any other body that is a subordinate unit of the
American Library Association. In addition, the intermediate links of the hierarchy
are not needed to identify or clarify the function of the committee. Therefore, the
heading will be &ldquo;American Library Association. Library Standards for Microfilm
Committee.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The first added entry in figure 17-32 is another illustration of 24.14. The hier-
archy for this heading is
</p>

</p>
<p>The heading is &ldquo;American Library Association. Board on Cataloging Policy and
Research.&rdquo; The intermediate link was dropped because the function of the com-
mittee and its identity are clear without it. Also, no other division of ALA is likely
to have a Board on Cataloging Policy and Research.
</p>
<p>Notice the difference between the subheading &ldquo;Board on Cataloging Policy
and Research&rdquo; and the subheading that is the lowest element in the hierarchy of
the second example given under 24.14 in AACR2, &ldquo;Policy and Research Commit-
tee.&rdquo; Any of the sections or divisions, etc., of the American Library Association
might have a Policy and Research Committee. Its function and identity are not
clear without the addition of the next higher unit, the &ldquo;Cataloging and Classifica-
tion Section.&rdquo; However, no other ALA division is likely to have a unit called
&ldquo;Board on Cataloging Policy and Research.&rdquo; Thus, the name of the division may
be omitted.
</p>
<p>As just shown, the cataloger cannot always drop all of the intervening links
of a hierarchy. If the bottom link is of a type that is dependent on the next link
according to the stipulations of 24.13 Types 1&ndash;6, that link must be included. For
example, referring once more to figure 17-32, suppose the cataloger has a publi-
cation of the Program Committee of ALA&rsquo;s Board on Cataloging Policy and
Research. If all of the intervening links between Program Committee and
American Library Association were dropped, the entry would be &ldquo;American
Library Association. Program Committee.&rdquo; It would give the impression that this
body was a Program Committee for the entire association, not just for the Board
on Cataloging Policy and Research. Therefore, the cataloger would need to include
the name of the subdivision that identifies which Program Committee this one is.
The heading would be &ldquo;American Library Association. Board on Cataloging Policy
and Research. Program Committee.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>If the cataloger has omitted some of the connecting links in a hierarchy in
setting up a heading, a reference must be made that includes at least the immedi-
ately superior body. Although 24.14A is a sensible rule, the user of the catalog
cannot be expected to know which intermediate bodies have been dropped, and
so help is given in the form of a reference. The authority record for the Board on
Cataloging Policy and Research (figure 17-32) should contain a reference includ-
ing the immediately superior body in a 410 field, as shown. It will display:

<p>24.15B. If the bodies making up a joint committee are themselves subordinate
to a single larger body, the joint committee will be entered as a subordinate
heading under the name of the larger body. The many joint committees of the
United States Congress are entered as subdivisions under &ldquo;United States. Con-
gress.&rdquo; See also the example in AACR2 under 24.15B.
</p>
<p>Government Bodies and Officials
</p>
<p>Under the 1949 ALA rules, governments and their agencies, with certain specified
exceptions, were regarded as authors of publications for which they were respon-
sible. Such publications were to be entered under the name of the government,
with the agency as a subheading (ALA 1949 rules 71&ndash;72). Catalogers were re-
quired to determine whether there was any administrative or financial link
between the name of a corporate body and a government jurisdiction in order to
be certain that this rule was followed. All such headings had to be looked up in
official manuals such as (for the United States government) the United States
Government Organization Manual or another appropriate reference source. The rule
caused catalogers much grief, and it was difficult to apply consistently.
</p>
<p>In an attempt to solve the difficulties and inconsistencies of the 1949 rules, the
editors of AACR1 arrived at a general rule for government headings, which, in its
own way, was even more complex than the ALA 1949 rules it replaced. The rule
was based on the function of the agency rather than type of name; an agency that
exercised legislative, judicial, or executive functions was to be entered as a sub-
heading under the name of the government. All other agencies were to be entered
under their own names. To aid catalogers in determining agencies that were not
regarded as legislative, judicial, or executive, the editors drew up an elaborate list
of seven types of agencies with numerous examples, all to be entered under their
own names (rule 78). But almost immediately the cumbersome rule fell into diffi-
culties; exceptions were made for government agencies whose names included
terms suggesting subordination, such as &ldquo;bureau . . . administration,&rdquo; etc., regard-
less of the function of the body. The rule proved too complex to be satisfactory.
</p>
<p>The present rule adheres to the same principles governing nongovernment
bodies as set forth in 24.12 and 24.13; in fact, these two rules closely parallel 24.17
and 24.18 and should be compared. As with the rule for nongovernment bodies,
the general rule for choice of entry either subordinately or independently may be
summarized: if the government agency has a unique name not likely to be dupli-
cated elsewhere and one that does not include terms that suggest dependent
status, it should be entered under its own name. If the name of the agency
includes terms that suggest dependent status or that need the name of the gov-
ernment to identify the agency, the agency should be entered as a subordinate
unit under the name of the government.
</p>
<p>24.17. GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>Enter a subordinate government agency under its own name if its name is unique
and if it does not contain terms that suggest dependent status.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress has a name that is unique. Rule 24.17 stipulates that</p>

<p>Note the addition of the name of the governmental jurisdiction as a qualifier
at the end of headings for certain subordinate government bodies entered under
their own names. See discussion in this Handbook at 24.4C for explanation of this
practice. Jurisdictional qualifiers need not be added to governmental institutions
with names that are unique or that are unlikely to be duplicated. The Library of
Congress is such an institution; on the other hand, the National Gallery of Art is
a name that is likely to be duplicated in other English-speaking countries. There-
fore, despite the fact that it, like the Library of Congress, is an &ldquo;institution&rdquo; (see
discussion under 24.4C and definition at LCRI 24.4C, &ldquo;non-conflicts 2a,&rdquo; Feb. 11,
1992), U.S. should be added as a qualifier.

<p>The government agency that calls itself the Ontario Geological Survey is a
further example of a name that does not contain terms implying subordination. It
will be entered directly under its own name. Because the name contains the name
of the government, no qualifier is needed. Furthermore, there is no equivalent of
24.13 Type 6 (name that includes the entire name of the higher body) in 24.18, so
although the name includes &ldquo;Ontario,&rdquo; it is not entered subordinately (LCRI
24.18, Jan. 5, 1989; see figure 17-36).

<p>24.18. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ENTERED SUBORDINATELY
</p>
<p>This rule parallels 24.13; the types of corporate bodies that will be entered as sub-
headings under the name of a higher body as given in 24.13 are closely correlated,
and in some cases identical, to the types of government agencies that will be
entered under the name of the government. In both instances, the principle is the
same: if the name of the subordinate unit contains terms that imply subordina-
tion, or that are incomplete or not clearly identified without the name of the gov-
ernmental jurisdiction, the agencies will be entered as subordinate bodies under
the name of the government. The rule is based strictly on the way the agency&rsquo;s
name is formulated.
</p>
<p>Type 1. If an agency&rsquo;s name includes a word, such as &ldquo;department,&rdquo; &ldquo;section,&rdquo;
&ldquo;service,&rdquo; &ldquo;bureau,&rdquo; etc. (or foreign equivalents), that implies that the agency is
subordinate to a higher body, enter the agency subordinately. Figure 17-37, a pub-
lication of the State of Virginia&rsquo;s Department of Historic Resources, includes an
example of such a heading (see discussion, Handbook, under 24.13 Type 1 for ab-
breviation of &ldquo;Dept.&rdquo;).

<p>Type 2. Notice the exact parallel between this rule and 24.13 Type 2. A good
rule of thumb for a decision about whether &ldquo;the name of the government is
required for the identification of the agency&rdquo; or not is if the name of the commis-
sion, committee, etc., is made up simply of generic words signifying its function
or if (as with government agencies covered by 24.17) it has a distinctive name. The
Commission on Obscenity and Pornography (figure 17-38) needs the name of the
government for identification.</p>

<p>As it did with nongovernment agencies subsumed under 24.13 Type 2, the
Library of Congress has issued a list of terms in English, French, and Spanish to
help catalogers determine whether a subordinate government agency falls under
the jurisdiction of 24.18 Type 2. For bodies with names in these languages, only
those containing one or more of the words listed below will be treated according
to this type (LCRI 24.18, &ldquo;Type 2,&rdquo; Nov. 1995).

<p>Type 3. An agency with a name that is general in nature or that does no more
than indicate a geographic, chronological, or numbered or lettered subdivision of
the government or one of its agencies is entered subordinately.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress has interpreted the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; to mean a name
that contains no proper nouns, adjectives, or subject words. Such terms as &ldquo;Re-
search Center,&rdquo; &ldquo;Library,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Technical Laboratory&rdquo; are examples of general names
that should be entered under the name of the government. On the other hand, in
headings established since 1988, such general words and phrases plus the term
&ldquo;national&rdquo; or &ldquo;state&rdquo; or their equivalents in foreign languages are not considered
to be examples of 24.18 Type 3 (LCRI 24.18, &ldquo;Type 3,&rdquo; Jan. 5, 1989). Previously the
interpretation was the opposite to this, so headings have been established both
ways in the Name Authority File (see figure 17-39 for an example).

<p>Type 4. This subsection of 24.18 is exactly parallel to 24.13 Type 4. It includes
subordinate government agencies whose names do not convey the idea of a cor-
porate body (see examples in AACR2 and discussion under 24.13 &ldquo;Type 4&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Type 5. A top-level executive agency in a national government (cf. LCRI 24.18,
&ldquo;Type 5,&rdquo; Jan. 5, 1989) will be entered as a subordinate heading under the name
of the government, regardless of whether its name includes words such as &ldquo;depart-
ment,&rdquo; &ldquo;ministry,&rdquo; &ldquo;administration,&rdquo; or not. However, names of most such agencies
do include such terms; in most cases, these agencies are also examples of 24.18
Type 1, having names that imply that the body is a part of another.
</p>
<p>In the example shown in figure 17-40, the heading in the first 710 field is for
a Type 5 government agency. Note that according to stipulations of 23.2A, the cat-
aloger will use the English form of name for the government: Austria, rather than
&Ouml;sterreich. But the name of the government agency (translated as &ldquo;Federal Min-
istry of Agriculture and Forestry&rdquo;) is always to be given in the vernacular. Make
reference from the vernacular form of the name of the government, according to
the provisions of 26.3A1 in the authority record for the government:

<p>24.19. DIRECT OR INDIRECT SUBHEADING
</p>
<p>This rule is parallel to 24.14. It applies only to agencies entered as subheadings of
the government according to 24.18. As with nongovernment corporate bodies,
sometimes a government agency is a part of a chain or hierarchy of agencies, each
dependent on the one above it. Also, as with nongovernment corporate bodies,
sometimes one or more of the links in the chain may be omitted in the heading.
See discussion in this Handbook under 24.14 for full explanation.
</p>
<p>Figure 17-41 shows a government agency that is entered directly under the
name of the government. In 1968, the United States Office of Education was an
agency under the control of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
The name of the department is not needed to identify or clarify the function of the
Office of Education. Furthermore, the name of the agency has not been, nor is it
likely to be, used by another agency entered under the United States government.

<p>24.20. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
</p>
<p>This rule covers form of heading for official messages, proclamations, etc., that
will be entered under the heading for a head of a government according to 21.4D.
</p>
<p>24.20B. Heads of state, etc.
</p>
<p>This rule includes governors as well as sovereigns and presidents. Headings for
such individuals include the inclusive years of reign or incumbency and the name
of the individual (see figure 17-42).</p>

</p>
<p>For an example of a corporate heading for the United States president, see
figure 1-75. See figure 14-18 for an example of the collective heading used for
more than one United States president. See Handbook at 21.4D for a discussion of
entries and references.
</p>
<p>24.20C. Heads of governments and of international 
intergovernmental bodies
</p>
<p>Effective with the 2003 revision to AACR2, official statements from heads of gov-
ernments other than those covered by 24.20B are now entered under the same
type of heading as that given heads of state (previously dates and names of
incumbents were not included in the subheading). As is done for heads of state
entered under official title, an added entry will be made for the incumbent (see
figure 1-104 for an example).
</p>
<p>As previously discussed, by policy decision based on British Library practice,
headings for all corporate entries dealing with the United Kingdom will be &ldquo;Great
Britain&rdquo; (LCRI 23.2, &ldquo;Special decision 3,&rdquo; Feb. 2002). The Library of Congress will
use the heading &ldquo;Great Britain. Prime Minister,&rdquo; for example, rather than &ldquo;United
Kingdom. Prime Minister,&rdquo; as shown in AACR2 24.20C. Examples in this text
follow LC policy (see figure 17-43).
</p>
<p>24.20E. Other officials
</p>
<p>Official statements from a government official who is not a head of a government
will be entered under the heading for the agency he or she represents (see figure
17-44). Added entry will be made for the name of the person if the person is
prominently named in the publication. An added entry is also to be made, when
appropriate, for the name of the body to which an official report, statement, etc.,
is transmitted. Reference is made from the title of the official, generated from the
410 fields in the authority records. The authority record for this figure displays:
</p>
<p>United States. Comptroller General of the United States
search under
</p>
<p>United States. General Accounting Office
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress has commented on rule 24.20E, stating, &ldquo;If the chief
source gives only the name of the official, nevertheless use the name of the min-
istry or agency that the official represents in the heading. If necessary, determine
the latter from reference sources&rdquo; (LCRI 24.20E, Jan. 5, 1989).
</p>
<p>24.21. LEGISLATIVE BODIES
</p>
<p>24.21A. Pre-AACR2 cataloging rules called for &ldquo;United States. Congress. House of
Representatives&rdquo; to be shortened to &ldquo;U.S. Congress. House.&rdquo; The practice abbre-
viating &ldquo;United States&rdquo; was discontinued with AACR2. However, the Library of
Congress continues to shorten &ldquo;House of Representatives&rdquo; to &ldquo;House&rdquo; (LCRI 24.21B,
Jan. 5, 1989). Examples in this text follow LC policy (see figure 17-45).</p>

<p>24.21D. This rule is only applied to the U.S. Congress (in LC practice). The
required order is as shown in figure 17-47. Do not add number and year unless
(1) an entry must be made for the U.S. Congress or one of its chambers as a whole,
(2) no entry is appropriate for any subordinate unit (e.g., a committee), and (3) the
number of the session is named in the chief source (LCRI 24.21D, Jan. 5, 1989).
Thus, because entry is under a subordinate unit in figure 17-46, the number and
year of the congress are not used in the heading.

<p>24.26. DELEGATIONS TO INTERNATIONAL AND
INTERGOVERNMENTAL BODIES
</p>
<p>The rules governing headings for delegations have changed frequently over the
years, most recently in 1998. Delegations have been entered under the name of the
country represented since AACR1 rule 86. This was a change from ALA 1949 rule
79, which formulated a conference heading with the name of the delegation as a
subheading following the name of the conference for such a group. Under ALA
1949 rule 79, the example shown in figure 17-49 would have received the heading:
</p>
<p>Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace, Buenos Aires,
1936. Delegation of the United States of America
</p>
<p>Rule 24.26, as well as its predecessor AACR1 rule 86, represents a return to
1908 rules.
</p>
<p>The Mexican delegation to the Inter-American Conference also made a report
to its home country. According to ALA 1949 rule 79 the heading, like the previous
one, would have been the name of the conference followed by the name of the
delegation in the vernacular:

in one place in the catalog.
</p>
<p>Rule 24.26, on the other hand, calls for main entry under the name of the gov-

<p>25.1. USE OF UNIFORM TITLES
</p>
<p>Many works appearing in library catalogs are published in varying issues, trans-
lations, etc., with different titles. Because one of the objects of the library catalog
is to show what works the library has by a given author, some method must be
devised to bring these works issued with varying titles together in the catalog.1
Probably the best way to do it is for the cataloger to choose one title and to gather
all of the manifestations of the work together under this one title. Such a title is
known as a uniform title.
</p>
<p>Uniform titles are used for various purposes. AACR2 25.1A lists four:
</p>
<p>1. to bring together all entries for a work when various manifestations have
appeared under various titles,
</p>
<p>2. to provide identification for a work when its title proper differs from that
by which it is commonly known,
</p>
<p>3. to differentiate between two or more works published under identical title
proper, and
</p>
<p>4. to organize the bibliographic file.
</p>
<p>The use of uniform titles in library catalogs is not new. Such works as sacred
scriptures (the Bible, etc.) have long been entered under uniform title. So-called
anonymous classics (epics, folktales, etc., whose authors are unknown) are like-
wise by long-standing custom entered under uniform title. AACR2 chapter 25
brings together not only these uses of uniform titles, but also utilizes uniform titles
to bring together varying titles for other works.
</p>
<p>Most libraries use uniform titles for sacred scriptures and anonymous clas-
sics. The use of uniform title for modern works aside from music has not had
similar widespread acceptance, although this appears to be changing. This is rec-
ognized by the editors of AACR2 with the statement at 25.1A, &ldquo;The need to use

</p>
<p>uniform titles varies from one catalogue to another and varies within one cata-
logue.&rdquo; Illustrations and discussion in this chapter are based on the policy that all
uniform titles are displayed as part of the catalog entry.
</p>
<p>AACR2 chapter 25 is organized similarly to previous chapters. It begins with
a general rule (25.2), followed by some general rules for choice and form of title.
These are followed by special rules for particular types of works that may be
arranged using uniform titles.
</p>
<p>MARC Coding of Uniform Titles
</p>
<p>It goes without saying that a work for which a uniform title may be provided will
be entered, like any other work, in the catalog according to the rules in AACR2
chapter 21, &ldquo;Choice of Access Points.&rdquo; Accordingly, if a work should be entered
under author, the uniform title will be recorded in the 240 field, between the
author main entry heading (1XX field, as discussed in Handbook chapter 14) and
the transcription of the title page (245 field) (see figure 18-1).2 Because it must
always be accompanied by an author, this type of uniform title will be referred to
as an &ldquo;author-title uniform title&rdquo; in the following paragraphs.
</p>
<p>The first indicator of the 240 field tells the system whether to display the
uniform title or not. Generally, this should be coded &ldquo;1&rdquo; (display). The second
indicator gives the number of nonfiling characters (the number of characters that
the system should skip before beginning to file the title). Because under AACR2
25.2C1 initial articles are omitted from uniform titles, this indicator should always
be coded &ldquo;0.&rdquo; Initial articles are dropped whether they appear in the nominative
case or not, for languages that distinguish by case (CSB 52, spring 1991, p. 26). The

</p>
<p>uniform title itself is recorded in subfield &Dagger;a. Other subfield codes will be dis-
cussed later in the chapter. Do not enclose the uniform title in brackets; these are
supplied by the system.
</p>
<p>The MARC authority record for author-title uniform titles is a bit tricky,
because it must authorize two bibliographic fields (the 1XX and the 240 fields)
from a single (1XX) authority field. The heading in the authority record consists
of the established form for the author (see Handbook chapter 15), plus the title in
subfield &Dagger;t following a full stop. Further title-related subfields may be added as
necessary.
</p>
<p>The trick to interpreting a MARC authority record for an author-title uniform
title is to remember that everything preceding subfield &Dagger;t will go into the 1XX
field of the bibliographic record; that following subfield &Dagger;t goes into the 240 field
exactly as in the authority record, with the exception that the 240 field begins with
subfield &Dagger;a, not subfield &Dagger;t.
</p>
<p>Author-title uniform titles used in other areas of the record (6XX fields for
subject headings, 7XX fields for added entries, 8XX fields for series) are entered
exactly as they appear in the authority record.
</p>
<p>An example of an authority record for an author-title uniform title accompa-
nies figure 18-1. The established form for Dickens appears in subfields &Dagger;a and &Dagger;d
of the 100 field; the uniform title appears in subfield &Dagger;t. The 400 field contains a
reference from the form of the title that appears on the book, as stipulated by
AACR2 25.2E2 and 26.4B1, because it differs from the uniform title. This field will
generate the following display:
</p>
<p>Dickens, Charles, 1812-1870. Adventures of Oliver Twist
search under
</p>
<p>Dickens, Charles, 1812-1870. Oliver Twist
</p>
<p>If according to the provisions of AACR2 chapter 21 a work is to be entered
under title as main entry and the title varies in different versions, such a work
may also be given a uniform title. In this case the uniform title becomes the main
entry (and thus will be referred to in the following paragraphs as a &ldquo;main-entry
uniform title&rdquo;) and is recorded in the 130 field of the bibliographic record. The
first indicator, nonfiling characters, should be coded &ldquo;0&rdquo; (AACR2 25.2C1 calling
for the omission of initial articles); the second is left blank. The title is recorded in
subfield &Dagger;a, with other title-related subfields as explained later in this chapter. If
used as an added entry, it will be recorded in the 730 field; if used as a subject, in
the 630 field; if used as a series, in the 830 field. A main-entry uniform title is
recorded in a 130 field of the authority record in the same manner. The pattern of
the indicators is reversed, however, in the authorities format: the first indicator is
blank, the second is &ldquo;0.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Do not enclose main-entry uniform titles in brackets. The system will supply
brackets if the cataloging agency chooses to use them (cf. AACR2 25.2A option).
</p>
<p>25.2. GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>25.2A. If a work appears under various titles, select one of the titles as the uniform
title under which all manifestations of the work will be cataloged. The rules for
selection (25.3&ndash;25.4) are based on the first sentence of Paris Principle 7:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>472 UN I F O R M TI T L E S
</p>
<p>The uniform heading should normally be the most frequently used
name (or form of name) or title appearing in editions of the work cata-
logued or in references to them by accepted authorities.3
</p>
<p>25.2B. Uniform title is not to be used to connect revised editions of a work that
appear under different titles. Relate these titles with a note and an added entry for
the title of the earlier edition.
</p>
<p>25.2C. Initial articles
</p>
<p>Initial articles are to be omitted from uniform titles. This includes languages dis-
tinguishing by case: drop all initial articles, even those not in the nominative case
(CSB 52, spring 1991, p. 26). An exception is made when such titles begin with an
article that forms a part of a personal, geographic, or corporate name (La Fontaine,
Los Angeles, El Cajon) or &ldquo;when the title begins with an article in a situation in which
meaning and cataloger&rsquo;s judgment require its retention&rdquo; (LCRI 21.30J, June 2002).
</p>
<p>25.2E. Added entries and references
</p>
<p>25.2E1. Works entered under title. Figure 18-2 is a work entered under a uniform
title. As noted above, such uniform titles are entered in the 130 field. Such a work
will have an added entry under the title proper as it appears in the chief source
of information of the item being cataloged. A reference to the uniform title
(Mother Goose) will also be made the first time this &ldquo;variant&rdquo; title (i.e., title other
than the uniform title) appears in the catalog, as shown in the authority record.
This displays:
</p>
<p>Book of nursery songs and rhymes
search under
</p>
<p>Mother Goose
</p>
<p>Like other references, this reference is made one time only; it does not refer to a
specific issue of Mother Goose but simply to the work in all of its variant manifes-
tations. A similar reference will be made from any other variant of the uniform
title in the library&rsquo;s collection. For the example shown in figure 18-3, make a
second reference, shown in the authority record accompanying figure 18-2. This
will display:
</p>
<p>Mother Goose nursery rhymes
search under
</p>
<p>Mother Goose
</p>
<p>25.2E2. Works entered under a personal or corporate heading. Figure 18-1 is
an example of a work entered under personal heading. Also given above is the
format for the reference that will be made the first time the work known as Oliver
Twist appears with the variant title The Adventures of Oliver Twist. The reference
refers not to the Heritage Illustrated Bookshelf edition of Dickens&rsquo;s tale, but simply
to the work Oliver Twist generally. In contrast, the title added entry traced from
the 245 field, an added entry for the title proper (The Adventures of Oliver Twist) of
this edition, refers specifically to this edition and to no other. The rule stipulates</p>

<p>25.3. WORKS CREATED AFTER 1500
</p>
<p>25.3A. When editions of a modern work (i.e., one first created after 1500) have
appeared under varying titles, use the best-known title in the original language
of the work. &ldquo;Best-known title&rdquo; should be determined either by checking refer-
ence sources to see how they refer to the work or by examining issues and edi-
tions of the work to see which title is most frequently used. Obviously, for an
author such as William Shakespeare, examination of citations to his individual
plays, etc., in reference sources would be appropriate.
</p>
<p>The first time an edition of Macbeth with the title The Tragedy of Macbeth is
received in the library, a reference will be made in an authority 400 name-title
field, as shown in the authority record for figure 18-4. This will display:

<p>25.4. WORKS CREATED BEFORE 1501
</p>
<p>25.4A. General rule
</p>
<p>Most works created before 1501 exist in many varying versions, editions, etc., with
almost as many variant titles. The cataloger is to identify the best-known title,
using modern reference works, in the language of the original work, if possible.
</p>
<p>Some of these works are known to be the responsibility of a particular author.
Entry for such works is governed by general rule 21.1A2; uniform title is added,
following 25.2A, in a 240 field between the name of the author and transcription
of the title proper from the chief source of information (see figure 18-6).
</p>
<p>Many works created before 1501 have no known author. Of these, many
epics, poems, romances, tales, plays, chronicles, etc., have been retold, reprinted,
published, translated, etc., many times in many versions over the centuries. Cata-
logers have given the name &ldquo;anonymous classic&rdquo; to the genre. Because anony-
mous classics find a place, often in translation, even in small general libraries, the
cataloger should have some familiarity with some of the better-known anony-
mous classics and should know the rules for entry of such works.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>476 UN I F O R M TI T L E S
</p>
<p>Following the rule for entry for anonymous works, title main entry is appro-
priate (21.5A). Because the title varies from one edition to the next, the cataloger
will identify the best-known title, according to general prescriptions in 25.4A, and
will give main entry to this title for all editions of the work. Mother Goose (figures
18-2 and 18-3) is an example of an anonymous classic. No one knows the author
of most of the traditional rhymes usually included in such collections; titles vary
with the ingenuity of the compiler or editor. The best-known title, Mother Goose,
will serve as the uniform title for all manifestations of this work.
</p>
<p>A uniform heading will be used alone for an edition of the work in the lan-
guage of the original. If the edition being cataloged is a translation, the name of
the language of the translation is to be added after the uniform title (25.5C) in sub-
field &Dagger;l. The language of the original is also added if the original text accompanies
the translation (see figure 18-7). A reference will be made from the authority
record, which displays:

<p>In cataloging anonymous classics, the cataloger should be wary of publica-
tions presented as adaptations. These are to be entered under the name of the
adapter, following provisions of 21.10. Give added entry to the uniform title in a
730 field for the original work as shown in figure 18-8. Note that as a &ldquo;related
works&rdquo; added entry, no language is added to the title, even though English is not
the original language of Cuchulain.

<p>25.4B. Classical and Byzantine Greek works
</p>
<p>The rule for uniform title for a work in classical or Byzantine Greek is an excep-
tion to the general rule of using a uniform title in the original language of the
work. Rule 25.4B is analogous to 22.3C1, which directs the cataloger to make
entry for persons whose names were written in a nonroman script in the form in
which they are found in English-language reference sources. As with anonymous
classics, if the edition being cataloged is a translation, the cataloger will add the
name of the language of the translation to the uniform title (see figure 18-9).

</p>
<p>This rule is closely related to 25.4B, which directs the use of an English-language
title for classical and Byzantine Greek works. Likewise, the cataloger is to prefer
a title in English for an anonymous work created before 1501 whose original lan-
guage is not written in Greek or in roman script (see figure 18-10).
</p>
<p>The Arabian Nights is an anonymous work originally written in Arabic. The
cataloger is directed to prefer an established title in English as uniform title. As
shown in the authority record accompanying figure 18-11, reference from the
romanized form of the original title should be made to the English-language title
chosen under 25.4C. Figure 2-9 shows an English translation of The Arabian

<p>25.5. ADDITIONS TO UNIFORM TITLES
</p>
<p>25.5B. Conflict resolution
</p>
<p>25.5B1. This rule provides for the addition in parentheses of a word or phrase to
distinguish a uniform title from an identical or similar heading in the catalog. For
discussion of this rule as it applies to serial and series titles, see chapter 12 in this
Handbook, including discussion of title main entry for serials; figures 12-9 and 12-10;
and LCRI 25.5B (June-Aug. 2002).
</p>
<p>25.5C. Language
</p>
<p>25.5C1. Translations. For an item in which the language is different from the orig-
inal, add the name of the language to the uniform title. Separate the uniform title
from the name of the language by a full stop and subfield &Dagger;l (see figure 18-7 for an
example of language added to uniform title for an anonymous classic). Uniform
title plus language is used to bring translations into the same place in the library
catalog as the original work (see figure 18-12 for a translation of a modern work).
</p>
<p>Although libraries customarily use uniform headings for anonymous classics,
not all libraries will choose to use uniform titles to collect translations of modern
works under a single heading in the catalog. For a nonresearch library, which is
unlikely to acquire works such as those illustrated in figures 1-9, 14-36, 14-37, and
18-12 in the original language, the addition of a uniform title to the entry may
actually be confusing and undesirable. For this reason, the use of uniform titles is
subject to the policy of the cataloging agency (25.1).
</p>
<p>25.5D. Optionally, the cataloger may add a GMD (see 1.1C) as the last element
in the uniform title. No national library makes this optional addition.</p>

<p>25.6. PARTS OF A WORK
</p>
<p>25.6A. One part
</p>
<p>One of the problems that the cataloger must solve is the question of how to
handle separately published parts of a work, particularly if library policy is to
relate such parts to the main work from which they have been taken. One way to
accomplish this is by the use of uniform title. The title of the part by itself serves
as uniform title. Orson Scott Card&rsquo;s Tales of Alvin Maker is an example of a whole
work, each of whose parts may be handled in such a fashion (see figure 18-13a).
Note that in this case, because the complete uniform title (Prentice Alvin) is iden-
tical to the title proper, it is not included in the bibliographic record (cf. LCRI 25.1,
&ldquo;Applicability,&rdquo; Feb. 15, 1994).
</p>
<p>An authority record is created for this uniform title, giving as a reference in
subfield &Dagger;a of a 400 field the author&rsquo;s name followed by the title of the whole in
subfield &Dagger;t, subdivided by the number in subfield &Dagger;n and title of the part in sub-
field &Dagger;p.
</p>
<p>Another way to handle this situation is to treat the whole work as a series, as
shown in figure 18-13b.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress does not generally use explanatory references such
as those illustrated at AACR2 25.6A1 (Raven, Simon; and Sinbad the Sailor), pre-
ferring instead to use simple &ldquo;search under&rdquo; and &ldquo;search also under&rdquo; references
(see LCRI 26.2D, Feb. 1, 1989, and 26.3B&ndash;26.3C, Nov. 20, 1992).</p>

</p>
<p>Not too infrequently two works by an author will be issued together in one phys-
ical volume, with or without a collective title. This is the case with the example of
the two Horatio Alger novels, which may be cataloged as shown in figure 18-14a.

<p>25.8. COMPLETE WORKS
</p>
<p>In a library in which it seems advantageous to gather all editions of an author&rsquo;s
complete works together in the catalog, regardless of the title proper appearing
on the various chief sources of information, a conventional uniform title in
English, &ldquo;Works,&rdquo; may be used. Add language in subfield &Dagger;l if the item is a trans-
lation. Although not called for in AACR2, the Library of Congress adds the date
of publication in subfield &Dagger;f at the end of the uniform title &ldquo;Works,&rdquo; whether it</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>484 UN I F O R M TI T L E S
</p>
<p>appears in a 240 field or a 7XX name-title entry (LCRI 25.8, Nov. 10, 1993, and
21.30M, Nov. 10, 1993). This addition is made because the collective uniform title
&ldquo;Works&rdquo; is used so frequently as to make it advisable, in the judgment of the
Library of Congress, to further subdivide the file. LC has chosen to do this by date
of publication. This reasoning may not be applicable to the majority of libraries,
which will not have the mammoth collections of the Library of Congress. As with
the policy decision on whether and when to use uniform titles at all (AACR2 25.1),
the decision on whether to add dates to collective uniform titles is up to the local
cataloging agency. LC policy has been followed in this Handbook (see figure 18-15).

<p>25.9. SELECTIONS
</p>
<p>As with the conventional uniform title &ldquo;Works,&rdquo; the conventional uniform title in
English &ldquo;Selections&rdquo; may be used if it seems advantageous to gather various edi-
tions of selections from a voluminous author&rsquo;s work in one place in the library&rsquo;s
catalog (see figure 18-16). See discussion in this Handbook at 25.8 on the addition
of the date to the uniform title and LCRI 25.9 (Feb. 25, 1993) (the same reasoning
applies to the collective title &ldquo;Selections&rdquo; as to &ldquo;Works&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>25.10. WORKS IN A SINGLE FORM
</p>
<p>If the resource being cataloged consists of a collection of the works of an author
written in a single literary form, the conventional uniform titles listed under 25.10
may be used to gather various editions into one place in the library&rsquo;s catalog.

<p>Note that the list is not exclusive. Other appropriate specific collective titles may
be used (see LCRI 25.10, May 28, 1993, for helpful comments). Date is not added
to this type of collective uniform title.
</p>
<p>25.11. TRANSLATIONS, ETC.
</p>
<p>This rule pertains to translated works entered under uniform title according to
rules 25.8 through 25.10. See figure 18-16 for an example of name of language
added to the uniform title &ldquo;Selections.&rdquo; Note that the language of translation pre-
cedes that of the original in this bilingual text, and the names of the languages are
separated by &ldquo;&amp;,&rdquo; not &ldquo;and.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Take careful note of the order prescribed in 25.11 for the name of the language
and the subdivision &ldquo;Selections.&rdquo; When added as a subdivision to a uniform title,
this must follow the name of the language (if present) rather than precede it. In
addition, when &ldquo;Selections&rdquo; is used to further subdivide a uniform title (rather
than used as a collective title itself), it is placed in subfield &Dagger;k. To illustrate these
two points, if the book cataloged in figure 18-9 contained only translated selec-
tions of the Odyssey rather than the complete work, its uniform title would be
</p>

<p>Special Rules for Certain Types of Work
</p>
<p>25.13. MANUSCRIPTS AND MANUSCRIPT GROUPS
</p>
<p>Use this rule when cataloging a manuscript that contains (a) more than one work
and that lacks a title, or a manuscript group that lacks a title, and (b) the situation
would not be covered by any of the rules previous to 25.13. Use 25.13 also to for-
mulate headings when an added entry is wanted for the manuscript(s) as a phys-
ical entity (without regard to its contents) (see figure 18-10 for the distinction
between uniform title for the text [Book of the dead] and that for the manuscript
as a physical entity [Papyrus of Ani]). Many such manuscripts have acquired
titles subsequent to their writing; if this is so, use the title that has been assigned
to the manuscript or that title by which the manuscript is commonly known. If
the manuscript has no &ldquo;commonly known&rdquo; title, create a uniform title according
to directions under 25.13B1c.
</p>
<p>The Dead Sea scrolls qualify as an example of a manuscript group that has
come to be identified in reference sources by a familiar name. Use this name as
the uniform title. Add the name of the language of the translation, if any, follow-
ing the uniform title (see figure 18-17).
</p>
<p>If a manuscript has not acquired a title by which it is commonly known, enter it
under its current repository (LCRI 25.13, &ldquo;repository name,&rdquo; May 2001), as follows:
</p>
<p>&Dagger;a [name of repository]. &Dagger;k Manuscript. &Dagger;n [repository&rsquo;s designation 
for the manuscript].
</p>
<p>The requirement that headings of this type be entered under the current reposi-
tory means that if a manuscript changes hands or if the repository&rsquo;s name changes

<p>25.15A1. Collections. The collective title &ldquo;Laws, etc.&rdquo; is used as a uniform title for
general collections of laws of a jurisdiction. The effect of this uniform title, new to
AACR2, has been to create enormous files all under a single uniform title, espe-
cially for jurisdictions like the United States and other large countries and states.
Therefore, the Library of Congress has prescribed the addition of certain quali-
fiers to this collective title. For collections of laws from jurisdictions other than
U.S. states, add an &ldquo;appropriate designation&rdquo; in parentheses. This will usually be
the title proper of the collection, and may be further qualified by year, edition, etc.
(see figure 18-18).

<p>Sacred Scriptures
</p>
<p>25.17. GENERAL RULE
</p>
<p>This rule should be correlated with rule 21.37, which stipulates that sacred scrip-
tures will be entered under title. However, because of the nature of sacred scrip-
ture, such works have, in almost all cases, been issued many times, with varying
titles, over a long period of time. Main entry under a uniform title is thus appro-
priate (see figures 18-21 and 14-7). Uniform title will be the title by which the
scripture is most commonly known in English-language reference sources&mdash;if
possible, official sources authorized by the religious group involved. As with
other uniform titles, add the language of the translation to a translated work (see
figure 18-22).

<p>25.18. PARTS OF SACRED SCRIPTURES AND ADDITIONS
</p>
<p>It is indicative of the broader frame of reference on which AACR2 is based that
special rules for the Bible are no longer emphasized virtually to the exclusion of
the sacred scriptures of other religions as they were in previous codes. Rules for
uniform heading for special parts, versions, etc., of the Koran, Talmud, etc., are
worked out in a parallel fashion to those for the Bible and subsumed as parts of
the same rule governing headings for the Bible.</p>

<p>25.18A12. Alternatives to version. Another term can be substituted for the
name of the version when the text is the original language, when the version is
unknown, when it has been altered, when it cannot be identified by translator&rsquo;s
name, or when more than two versions are involved. The use of the surname of
the person who has altered the text as an alternative to use of name of version is
analogous to using the name of a translator in place of version (see figure 18-29).
</p>
<p>25.18A13. Year. The year of publication is the last element of the uniform
heading for the Bible. It is recorded in subfield &Dagger;f. In the case of a facsimile
edition, use the original date for the main entry heading; make an otherwise iden-
tical added entry in a 730 field, using the date of the facsimile.
</p>
<p>Liturgical Works, Theological Creeds, Confessions of Faith, etc.
</p>
<p>Compare rules for liturgical works, 25.19&ndash;25.23, with 21.39, the rule for entry.
Liturgical works were formerly entered under the name of the denomination fol-
lowed by the form subheading &ldquo;Liturgy and ritual.&rdquo; Under AACR2 rules, entry is
to be under the name of the denomination, with a uniform title for the work
interposed between the heading and the transcription of the title proper (see
figure 2-8 for an example of catalog entry for a liturgical work).
</p>
<p>25.19B. This rule calls for entry under a well-established English title for a
theological creed, confession of faith, etc., accepted by one or more denomina-
tional bodies (see figure 18-30). If there is no well-established English title, use a
title in the original language.

<p>NOTES
</p>
<p>1. Charles Ammi Cutter&rsquo;s objectives of the library catalog are still the basis of cataloging
theory. As he saw it, the library catalog had three objectives:
</p>
<p>1. To enable a person to find a book of which one of the following is known:
A. the author
B. the title
C. the subject
</p>
<p>2. To show what the library has:
D. by a given author
E. on a given subject
F. in a given kind of literature
</p>
<p>3. To assist in the choice of a book:
G. as to its edition (bibliographically)
H. as to its character (literary or topical)
