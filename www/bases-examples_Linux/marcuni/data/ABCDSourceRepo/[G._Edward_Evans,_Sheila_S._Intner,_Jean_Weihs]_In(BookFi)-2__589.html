<p> Preface to the Eighth Edition 
</p>
<p> The first edition of this book was written in 1970 and had a length of 175 printed 
pages. This edition is 500 printed pages   and reflects the dramatic changes that have 
transformed technical services over the past 40-plus years. The whats, hows, and wheres 
related to technical service activities bear only the broadest correlation with the activi-
ties of the 1970s. 
</p>
<p> This edition further emphasizes the rapidly changing environment in which techni-
cal services are conducted. There are several new chapters: chapter 4, &bdquo;Technical Ser-
vice Issues,&permil; includes material related to physical space needs; chapter 8, &bdquo;E-Resource 
Issues,&permil; examines how the growth of e-materials affects technical service work; chap-
ter 19, &bdquo;Copy Cataloging,&permil; reflects the ever-increasing need to be more efficient and 
to save limited funds for technical service activities; chapter 13, &bdquo;Overview and Deci-
sions,&permil; addresses the issue of why and how the local OPAC has become a gateway to 
the universe of knowledge; and finally, chapter 20, &bdquo;Processing Materials,&permil; covers the 
activities involved in making sure the items that go into a library&Ecirc;s collection are prop-
erly identified as belonging to the library and determining where the item is physically 
located in the collection. All of the other chapters have been extensively rewritten and 
updated to reflect 2010 technical service functions and activities. 
</p>
<p> We also thank Jay Lucker for providing an excellent section in chapter 4 on plan-
ning physical spaces for technical services. </p>

<p>Chapter
</p>
<p>1    Introduction 
</p>
<p> Because technical services are usually not purchased by end-users, their value 
for money (or benefit-cost ratio) cannot be directly measured. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Philip Hider, 2008 
</p>
<p> Given this daunting but exciting set of circumstances, there is a future for 
technical services, but it may take on other names (access management and 
digital and Internet services are two examples). 
</p>
<p> &middot;Vera Fessler, 2007 
</p>
<p>  Introduction to Library Technical Services,  Eighth Edition, may be the last edition 
with that title, assuming that Vera Fessler&Ecirc;s assessment of the future of technical ser-
vices is accurate. 1  The chapter epigraphs suggest that in the 21st century there will 
be major changes in what librarians have been calling technical services. We, the au-
thors, both agree and disagree with Fessler&Ecirc;s view. In the broadest sense of information 
service, the traditional functions&middot;acquisitions and cataloging/indexing&middot;will remain 
but will probably have new names. The fact that technology is causing significant 
changes in how libraries deliver their services and what they offer does not fundamen-
tally change the goals of the basic functions. What and how we will perform technical 
service activities in the future certainly will look very different compared with today. 
Those differences may be even more profound than how things were done when the 
first edition of this book appeared in 1970, and technology was a mainframe computer. 
The basic functions and their labels have remained constant for more than 40 years. 
Who really knows what changes lie ahead over even the next 10 years? 
</p>
<p> Some individuals may doubt the viability of libraries in general, not just techni-
cal services. Certainly, the popular press makes it appear as if anything worth having </p>

<p>4 1&mdash;Introduction
</p>
<p>access to is freely available on the Web. There is no question that there is an enormous 
volume of material on the Web; a simple Google search usually returns tens of thou-
sands of hits. A question that is rarely addressed in the press is, &bdquo;how do you sort out 
the useful from the totally worthless?&permil; Librarians and teachers understand that many, 
if not most, young people seek information in a very different way than in the past. 
What libraries have been, and still are, good at is assessing, acquiring, and organizing 
important useful information and helping end-users gain access to that information. 
Essentially, libraries add value to information materials through the basic functions 
they perform. Much of that value added arises from the activities that we cover in this 
book&middot;technical services. 
</p>
<p> Libraries have a long history&middot;almost 5,000 years&middot;of not only providing society 
with access to information but also being able to adapt to changing technology. That 
adaptability will likely continue well into the future. Several years ago Ann Okerson 
wrote about what she considered to be eight &bdquo;eternal verities&permil; about library collections 
and services that are still valid today and that will continue to remain so well into the 
future: 2  
</p>
<p>  1. Content is selectable. 
  2. Content is collectable. 
  3. Libraries retain information for the long term. 
  4. Collections grow and require some type of space. 
  5. Long-term retention requires preservation of some type. 
  6. Libraries expect to be around for a very long time. 
  7. Libraries exist to meet users&Ecirc; information needs. 
  8. Today&Ecirc;s information is worldwide and so are libraries to help ensure the 
</p>
<p>worldwide preservation of information/knowledge. 
</p>
<p> We share these beliefs as her points are not tied to the form or manner of performing 
an activity. 
</p>
<p> The epigraph from Philip Hider indicates that placing a direct monetary value on 
technical services activities is very difficult. However, libraries have been making an 
effort to demonstrate what their return on investment is to those who fund their opera-
tions. One such study, from late 2006, reported that a group of public libraries gave 
evidence that they provide a 4 to 1 return on investment to their service communities. 3  
That is to say, the libraries created an annual economic impact on the community that 
was four times greater than the amount the communities invested in library services. 
Almost any investor would be pleased with that level of return and would continue 
to invest in the service. In his conclusion about his survey of a public library in New 
South Wales, Australia, Hider wrote: 
</p>
<p> Results from the CV survey indicated that Wagga Wagga City Library provides 
good value for money, and that its technical services provide especially good 
value. Given that the library is often visited for its collections (particularly its 
physical collection), the importance of the technical services operations might 
come as a great surprise, but the extent to which these operations add value 
to the collection, making it worth much more than if it comprised a randomly 
purchased and randomly arranged set if items, is worth emphasizing. 4  </p>

<p>Customer Service Philosophy 5
</p>
<p> LIBRARIES AND CUSTOMER SERVICE 
</p>
<p> We don&Ecirc;t argue that libraries are a societal good whose value goes far beyond any 
measure that can be derived by cost analysis or return on investment. However, it is 
also true that libraries are under enormous pressures to demonstrate evidence of ac-
countability. As Weingand states, 
</p>
<p> Librarians who flinch at the word  customer  are operating out of an outmoded 
paradigm. This older paradigm portrays the library as a &bdquo;public good&permil; with as 
high a ranking on the &bdquo;goodness&permil; scale as the national flag, parenthood, and 
apple pie. As a public good, the library &bdquo;should&permil; receive public support. How-
ever, today&Ecirc;s library is in increasingly tight competition for declining resources, 
and unless it adopts and masters the language and techniques of its competitors, 
it faces a future of declining support and significance. 5  
</p>
<p> In their &bdquo;Top Ten Assumptions for the Future of Academic Libraries and Librari-
ans,&permil; the Association of College and Research Libraries Research Committee listed as 
number seven, &bdquo;As part of the &Acirc;business of higher education,&Ecirc; students will increasingly 
view themselves as &Acirc;customers&Ecirc; of the academic library and will demand high-quality 
facilities, resources, and services attuned to their needs and concerns.&permil; 6  Another ra-
tionale, from a public-library perspective, is provided by Walters when she states that 
&bdquo;good service will result in customers voting for bond elections, contributing private 
dollars, and volunteering to support libraries. Poor service will result in lost elections 
and lost funding. It is as simple as that. Good customer service pays.&permil; 7  
</p>
<p> CUSTOMER SERVICE PHILOSOPHY 
</p>
<p> As noted earlier, attracting and retaining customers through programs specifically 
designed to produce loyalty to an organization&Ecirc;s product or service became a popular 
marketing trend in the 1980s. Every organization needs repeat customers to survive, 
and libraries are no exception. However, customers tend to remain loyal only as long 
as they are satisfied with the quality of the service or product provided. If these do not 
measure up or keep pace with changing customer preferences or needs, then repeat use 
cannot be ensured. As Jurewicz and Cutler observed, &bdquo;We have seen it in our own lives 
that as customer habits have changed, savvy businesses have changed their service 
strategies in an attempt to anticipate customer needs. . . . Too busy to go to the mall?

</p>
<p> Some people, both inside and outside the library profession, seem to believe only 
public service personnel need to think about customer service and its quality. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. Service quality begins in technical services.

<p> This is as good a place as any to insert a word or two about words referring to the 
individuals who access libraries and their services. Words such as  patron, client, user, 
 and  customer  appear in library literature as references to such people. The labels have 
even generated a modicum of heat among the people who use one of the variations. </p>

<p>6 1&mdash;Introduction
</p>
<p>&bdquo;Patron&permil; is one of the longest-standing terms; however, some people think that label 
is demeaning to libraries and their staffs. (One can view patronage as suggesting that 
something cannot to exist on its own and requires a special person[s] to underwrite its 
existence). &bdquo;Customer,&permil; although it is in many ways the most appropriate term&middot;as 
in &bdquo;customer service&permil;&middot;is viewed by some in the field as too profit-oriented or com-
mercial to use for a public service/good like a library. &bdquo;Client&permil; also carries a stigma of 
commercialism for some&middot;lawyers or brokers have clients, not a library. &bdquo;User,&permil; for 
a few people, suggests a person with some bad habits. So, where does this leave us? 
Based on our years of library and archival experience, we believe either &bdquo;customer&permil; 
or &bdquo;user&permil; best reflects what library services are all about. After some debate, we have 
elected to employ &bdquo;user&permil; in this work to refer to the people who come to the library, 
or access online, library services. 
</p>
<p> ROLE OF LIBRARY SERVICES 
</p>
<p> Libraries have a long history of adapting to change, and one of the keys to their 
longevity has been their focus on service to the primary and secondary user community. 
We are not suggesting that today&Ecirc;s service philosophy&middot;equal service to all primary 
users&middot;has been in place all that long. Just as the contents of libraries have changed 
over time, so has the service philosophy evolved. 
</p>
<p> For the vast majority of their history, libraries served a very small segment of the 
people in their societies. The earliest libraries catered to government officers and reli-
gious leaders and essentially contained administrative materials (one can imagine how 
many clay tablets&middot;rarely with more than a few square inches of writing surface&middot;one 
would need for even a short poem). During the time scrolls were the dominant infor-
mation technology, the topical range of materials increased (in addition to govern-
ment data, there were plays, histories, and so on within libraries), as did the number 
of persons who could read and were given access to libraries. However, that number 
was still only a small percentage of the total population. The Dark Ages and Middle 
Ages brought about a narrowing of access&middot;very few people could read, including 
royalty. Also, books (called a codex)&middot;the new &bdquo;technology&permil; of the time&middot;were liter-
ally chained down in libraries because of their value, both because of their content 
and because of the cost of producing a handwritten book. Most of the books produced 
during this time were religious in character. With the arrival of movable type and the 
printing press, information materials began the explosion that continues to this day. 
</p>
<p> To understand the importance of excellent library service, you need only go back 
to the work of S. R. Ranganathan (an Indian scholar/mathematician/librarian) who 
played a leading role in developing modern librarianship in India. His  Five Laws of 
Library Science  was, and still is, the most succinct statement about what to consider 
when creating a collection or service that truly serves the end-user: books are for use, 
every reader his book, every book its reader, save the reader&Ecirc;s time, and a library is a 
growing organism. 9  These laws have a very clear customer focus and are essential to 
providing economical services. Since its first publication, time and time again Ran-
ganathan&Ecirc;s basic concepts have proven their viability and their applicability to vary-
ing areas of the field. </p>

<p>Technical Services Background 7
</p>
<p> WHAT ARE TECHNICAL SERVICES? 
</p>
<p> Technical services traditionally handled those tasks associated with bringing ma-
terials into the library and making them ready for the general public or service popula-
tion to use. Public services managed those activities that directly assisted the end-user 
in gaining access to information in the library&Ecirc;s collection as well as from other col-
lections. Later in this chapter we discuss how that pattern is changing. Although the 
structure is evolving, libraries still need to acquire materials in some manner for the 
end-user and process the items, be they paper or electronic. 
</p>
<p> All libraries, regardless of type, perform nine basic functions to carry out their 
information transfer activities: 
</p>
<p>  1.  Identification:  Locating potentially worthwhile items to add to the col-
lection(s). 
</p>
<p>  2.  Selection:  Deciding which of the identified items to add to the collec-
tion(s). 
</p>
<p>  3.  Acquisitions:  Securing the items selected for the collection(s). 
  4.  Organization:  Indexing and cataloging the items acquired in a manner 
</p>
<p>that will help the end-user locate materials in the collection(s). 
  5.  Preparation:  Labeling and otherwise making the items ready for storage 
</p>
<p>in a manner that allows for easy retrieval. 
  6.  Storage:  Housing the prepared items in units that take into consideration 
</p>
<p>the long-term preservation of the items while allowing staff and end-users 
easy access to the material. 
</p>
<p>  7.  Interpretation:  Helping end-users locate appropriate materials that meet 
the users&Ecirc; needs. 
</p>
<p>  8.  Utilization:  Providing equipment and space to allow staff and end-users 
to make effective use of the items in the collection(s). 
</p>
<p>  9.  Dissemination:  Establishing a system that allows for the use of items 
away from the library. 
</p>
<p> This book focuses on the first five activities (traditional technical services func-
tions). 10  
</p>
<p> TECHNICAL SERVICES BACKGROUND 
</p>
<p> Over the past 50 years there has been a steady shift in the philosophy underlying 
technical services. Emphasis is increasingly being placed on the end-user. Cataloging 
activities, which are the underlying core element in providing access to collections and 
quality service, are dependent on a complex set of rules and codes difficult for non-
cataloger librarians, much less the general public, to fully comprehend. The codes and 
rules are essential in providing consistency when organizing collections. Financial 
transactions (acquisitions) are also dependent on a set of codes and rules that are al-
most incomprehensible to anyone without a background in accounting or bookkeeping. 
Until relatively recently, end-user consideration or input to how the activities operated 
played almost no role in technical services. As late as the 1960s and early 1970s the </p>
<p/>

<p>8 1&mdash;Introduction
</p>
<p>general opinion was that the public card catalog, the means to gain access to the infor-
mation about the library&Ecirc;s collections, was a tool created by librarians for librarians. 
</p>
<p> Over time, and with a growing focus on attempting to understand end-users&Ecirc; 
information-seeking behavior and adjusting library processes and procedures to re-
flect that understanding, there were efforts to make technical services outputs more 
user-friendly. An example of the shift in thinking is illustrated in an article by Karen 
Drabenstott, Schelle Simcox, and Eileen Fenton reporting the results of a study of 
end-user understanding of public catalog subject headings. In their conclusion, they 
noted, &bdquo;It is time for the library community to grapple with the difficult questions 
about its subject access system and make informed decisions about solving the prob-
lem of low levels of end-user subject heading understanding.&permil; 11  
</p>
<p> Libraries have tried a number of organizational structures in the hope of breaking 
the front room (public services) and back room (technical services) view that prevailed 
in the past and that may still be encountered in some libraries. As far back as the 1940s, 
Raymond Swank argued that catalogers and bibliographers were the key staff to create 
a collection that end-users would find valuable. 12  However, for a variety of reasons, he 
was ahead of existing practice, and it was almost 10 years before anyone attempted 
to implement some of his ideas. In the mid-1950s, the University of Nebraska experi-
mented with a subject approach to providing end-user access. 13  The library assigned 
librarians responsibility for a subject area and for carrying out all the functions out-
lined in the previous section with the exception of preparation and storage. In theory, 
a person working directly with the public ought to better understand user needs and 
behavior, and therefore be able to create collections and access tools tailored to local 
conditions. Again, the effort was premature, and after a few years the concept was 
abandoned. The primary reason was that not everyone was equally interested or ca-
pable in all areas and end-users suffered the consequences of uneven subject service. 
</p>
<p> From a practical point of view, there were, and probably still are, issues in ap-
plying the concept in the real world. Individuals are usually neither equally skilled 
nor interested in every functional area of a library, so the person tends to focus on the 
high-interest areas at the expense of the other areas. As you might expect, that leads to 
very uneven service within and across subjects. In a statement to the Academic Techni-
cal Services Discussion Group session of the American Library Association (ALA), a 
group devoted to the concept of blending public and technical services responsibilities, 
Laura Harper correctly noted that you cannot force people to do what they cannot or 
do not want to do. 14  
</p>
<p> A common method for achieving some of the benefits of these ideas about blend-
ing the two traditionally distinct areas is to have technical services librarians work 
some hours at the reference desk. (Note: We are not aware of many instances where 
public service personnel also work in technical services on a part-time basis. Perhaps 
the work is too technical for less than three-quarter or full-time work.) Libraries take 
different approaches to that idea, ranging from voluntary to required desk hours. Such 
requests may, in fact, be a directive; in other instances compliance is truly up to the 
individual. In the long run, having individuals who want to do both activities will 
provide better-quality service to users. At the Loyola Marymount University (LMU) 
Library in Los Angeles, two newly graduated catalog librarians asked if they could 
have some reference desk hours when they were hired. Both believed working at the 
reference desk would help maintain their reference skills and enhance their career </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Technical Services Background 9
</p>
<p>options. Fifteen years later, they were still working at the reference desk and had not 
tested the career development idea. It is likely, if one or both were to leave, that the 
head of public services would probably want to make desk hours a part of the required 
duties for their successors, as both catalog librarians have become a true part of the 
reference team. 
</p>
<p> There are some disadvantages to consider before implementing such a plan. One is 
loss of productivity. For example, for technical services personnel an hour spent on the 
reference desk is an hour not spent on the &bdquo;real job.&permil; When there is a processing back-
log, the sense of what is real work becomes even stronger. Reference personnel also 
lose some productivity because they must train or update the reference skills of the 
technical service librarians. When reference work drew solely on printed materials 
this was not a major concern; today, with ever-increasing dependence on constantly 
changing electronic resources, it can be a significant issue. 
</p>
<p> Another issue is the quality of service that part-timers are able to provide, espe-
cially if desk hours are required. The LMU Library conducted several faculty and stu-
dent surveys regarding all aspects of library service as part of an assessment program 
in preparation for an institution-wide accreditation visit. One of the surprise findings 
was that the reference staff service overall was very highly regarded by both students 
and faculty. There were, however, numerous written comments about several librarians 
who only worked a few hours a week (none of the part-timers works more than four 
hours). Reference staff wore name tags displaying first names, so users had a sense of 
with whom they worked. Comments indicated that although the part-timers tried to 
help and sometimes succeeded, the time required was too high and the degree of con-
fidence in the results of the assistance was low from the user&Ecirc;s perspective. 
</p>
<p> A third issue is staff perception. When only technical services librarians are asked 
to cross over (that is, reference staff are not asked to assist in technical services), this 
sends a message about values&middot;that of devaluing technical service activities. With 
some administrative effort you can reduce the sense of devaluation but seldom elimi-
nate it. One method for blending the two areas that is not often used is a modified ver-
sion of the subject approach. Sometimes this is referred to as &bdquo;matrix teams,&permil; in which 
several people share a set of duties but allocate their time according to their interest 
and skill levels. An example might be four persons who share acquisitions, catalog-
ing, reference, and collection development responsibilities for the humanities. They 
might allocate their work time as illustrated in Table 1.1; notice that both the rows and 
columns add up to 100 percent.

<p>10 1&mdash;Introduction
</p>
<p> Clearly, the benefit of this approach is a better use of the skills, knowledge, and 
interests of each team member. At the same time, team members gain a holistic view 
of the library&Ecirc;s activities and service programs, which in turn should result in improved 
decision making, at least in terms of end-user needs. It is also clear that a matrix team 
needs individuals who are not only committed to the concept but also reasonably skilled 
in all the areas. That type of person is not always available, and developing in-house 
interest and skills or seeking such breadth during the hiring process takes time. 
</p>
<p> Knowledge Goals for Staff 
</p>
<p> The ALA Council adopted a set of core competencies for librarianship in January 
2009. 15  Four of the eight competencies identified relate to the areas of interest to this 
book&middot;information resources, organization of recorded knowledge and information, 
technological knowledge, and administration/management. Chapters 2 through 11 ad-
dress information resources, technology, and administration/management. The balance 
of the chapters examines issues related to the organization of knowledge, technology, 
and administration/management. 
</p>
<p> What are some of the specific competencies called for by the ALA? In terms of 
information resources, there is an expectation that a person understands the basics of 
information from its creation to distribution and eventual disposal. Also, there is a call 
for library staff members to have a grasp of the issues associated with creating and 
managing library collections (all formats) from selection to withdrawal. 
</p>
<p> For organization of knowledge, a person should know the principles related to order-
ing and systematically representing knowledge and information. Further, the individuals 
needs an understanding of the skills required to organize and describe information re-
sources and systems for cataloging, metadata, indexing, and classification of materials. 
Joy Williams provides excellent information about why all library employees, not just 
those in technical services, ought to have knowledge of the machine-readable cataloging 
(MARC) format and its role in online public access catalogs (OPACs). 16  
</p>
<p> When it comes to technology it is not surprising to read that everyone needs to 
understand how technology affects all aspects of library service and its daily work 
activities. Also essential is the skill to assess the cost-effectiveness and potential of 
existing and developing technologies for library work. It goes with saying that having 
basic computer skills with productivity software&middot;word processing and spreadsheet 
for example&middot;is a minimal requirement. 
</p>
<p> From the administration/management perspective, there are the obvious expecta-
tions that staff members have a grasp of the fundamentals of planning, priority setting, 
and fiscal matters (in technical services accounting and bookkeeping are examples of 
the fiscal area). Collaborative skills&middot;from teamwork to working with other librar-
ies and organizations&middot;are also needed. Finally, all libraries and component units, 
including technical services, must be constantly assessing their activities and demon-
strating their accountability. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> The technical services function provides both information resources that end-
users need and the means of gaining effective and efficient access to those materials. 
Technology has played an ever-greater role in changing the way in which technical </p>

</p>
<p> Technical Services 
Administration 
</p>
<p> The technical services manager&Ecirc;s most important responsibilities, whether or 
not he or she delegates any part of the managerial authority to another, are en-
suring that library policies are properly interpreted and implemented, that work 
is fairly distributed, and that all the work that is supposed to be done is done 
well and in a timely and cost-effective manner. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Shelia Intner and Peggy Johnson, 2008 
</p>
<p> [L]ibrary quality has been synonymous with collection size&middot;an assessment of 
what the library  has  rather than with what the library  does . 
</p>
<p> &middot;Peter Hernon and Ellen Altman, 1998 
</p>
<p> Managing and administration are often used as synonyms, although they have 
slightly different meanings. In the chapter epigraph, Intner and Johnson identify most 
of the roles and responsibilities involved in overseeing technical services operations. 
A slightly more detailed way to view the issue is to think of a manager of technical 
services operations as someone who is purposeful; makes things happen; accomplishes 
operations through people; is effective through the use of special knowledge, skills, 
practice, and experience; is aided by technology but not replaced by it; is accountable 
for the quality of outputs; and is responsible for the cost-benefits of activities. That is a 
rather long list, and all the factors are important. 
</p>
<p> If you had to pick just one of the above factors as the most critical, it would prob-
ably be remembering that it takes a team effort (the people factor) to have a successful 
outcome. Everyone can and should contribute to the outcome, regardless of a person&Ecirc;s 
job description or pay grade. Because there must be some understanding of the manage-
rial aspects of operations for there to be effective team performance, the content of this 
chapter has value for all categories of staff. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14 2&mdash;Technical Services Administration
</p>
<p> What are the differences, if any, between the terms &bdquo;administrator,&permil; &bdquo;manager,&permil; 
and &bdquo;supervisor&permil;? The root meaning of administrator is derived from Latin&middot; ad  (to) 
and  ministratio  (give service). Thus, an administrator gives service to her organization. 
In current usage, the term most often denotes the senior person in an organization or 
the group of people at the most senior level (the administration). Manager/manage-
ment generally refers to those who organize and coordinate activities in terms of a 
set of principles (mission), values, goals, policies, and so on. Supervisors have some 
of the responsibilities of managers, although at a lower level of accountability. They 
are responsible for the productivity and actions of a small group of employees. If you 
think of an organization as consisting of three levels of accountability&middot;top, middle, 
and bottom&middot;at the top would be administrators and managers, in the middle are the 
supervisors, and the bottom are the frontline staff. 
</p>
<p> Given the aforementioned definitions, the head of technical services would be a 
manager. Depending upon the library&Ecirc;s organizational structure, there may be several 
levels of managers. For example, a library might have a head of technical services and 
a head of the acquisitions department, a head of cataloging, and perhaps a head of pro-
cessing or serials or preservation, all of whom would be managers with probably one or 
two supervisors reporting to them. The foregoing reflects an older organizational pat-
tern, but one often still encountered. Today, quite frequently there is a flattening of the 
structure&middot;and fewer layers of managers. 
</p>
<p> The ultimate key to unit and library success is to have everyone working together 
(teamwork) to achieve the organizational goals. This applies to both the traditional or-
ganizational model (each person working more or less independently) and a more for-
mal team structure (more about teams and team building later in this chapter). Shifting 
from being an administrator, manager, or supervisor to being a leader is a key factor in 
achieving effective teamwork regardless of the organizational structure. Some years ago, 
Gleeson and Miller suggested that managers and supervisors in technical services ought 
to become coordinators rather than directors of their staff if they want to have units that 
adjust quickly to changing circumstances. 1  That advice is just as valid today as when it 
was first offered. Although Lihong Zhu focused on advertisements for head cataloging 
positions in academic libraries, her finding that the positions have become more mul-
tifaceted than in the past applies to almost all positions in technical services, not just 
heads of cataloging. 2  One of the newest aspects is the emphasis on team building.

<p> The Tips sections in this chapter will be useful at some point in your working ca-
reer, perhaps sooner than expected. As Pat Tunstall commented; 
</p>
<p> In these days of reduced funds and staff cutbacks, it is not unusual for peo-
ple to be moved sideways into supervisory positions or to have a number of 
library pages suddenly added to their list of responsibilities. It is often the 
case that these reluctant draftee managers have no previous experience . . . 
Who can blame them for feeling anxious about how they will handle their 
new charges? 3

<p> TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE TIME MANAGEMENT 
</p>
<p> Managing your time will assist you in more ways than just getting more work done. 
It can help reduce work stress for your benefit (and sometimes for your colleagues as </p>

</p>
<p>well). It may also help supervisors and managers delegate activities or reduce the ten-
dency to &bdquo;put off until tomorrow what you can do today&permil; behavior. These tips are rela-
tively easy to implement; what is more difficult is to follow them long enough to make 
them habits rather than special activities. Perhaps the least complicated but hardest to 
follow is avoiding the paper-shuffle game (this also relates to e-mail). In most work 
situations, there is a steady flow of documents across the desk, via the in basket or 
e-mail. Some of it is informational in nature and is the easiest to read and toss or delete. 
Too often, however, there is a tendency to quickly look at such items and think, &bdquo;I&Ecirc;ll 
get to this later when I have more time,&permil; and then set it aside in what becomes an ever-
growing pile of &bdquo;when I have time&permil; reading material. For many people that growing 
pile (mountain) becomes a source of stress because &bdquo;when I have time&permil; never seems to 
come. Reading the material when it arrives and taking the appropriate action&middot;filing it 
for future reference, passing it on, recycling it, or hitting the delete button&middot;will resolve 
the problem. 
</p>
<p> Some material may require a response by a given date. Again, responding right 
away will save time in the long run. There is a tendency to think, &bdquo;Oh, this is due in 
two weeks (or whenever); I&Ecirc;ll do this later.&permil; If nothing more, handling the matter im-
mediately saves the review time involved in rereading the material when the response 
is due. In addition, given that many issues arise unexpectedly, having completed an 
expected project ahead of time allows for more flexibility in responding to rush projects 
that suddenly appear. Waiting until later may lead to the item getting mislaid or falling 
so far down the e-mail list it is overlooked until after the date due, and that can cause an 
even greater expenditure of time and effort. There are items that require some search-
ing for information or just straightforward time to think about before taking action; a 
useful method for handling such items is to have a filing system based on action time 
requirements&middot;start tomorrow, the day after, in three days, and so forth. (This approach 
also helps organize time, as discussed later.) 
</p>
<p> A few items are complex or difficult projects that may seem overwhelming. One 
way to handle those items is to establish a finish-by date that is slightly earlier than 
the required date and break the activity into small, daily actions to maintain a sense of 
progress and provide a measure of success. 
</p>
<p> Perhaps the second most common suggestion for managing time is to create to-do 
lists. Using a file-folder system (either paper based or electronic) is a sound variation 
of the to-do list. One simple way to do this is to set up a file for each day of the week, 
one for next week, two weeks, and three weeks, thus covering a month. The files can 
hold some of the action items that require time to address thoughtfully. Each day just 
before leaving work, go into the next day&Ecirc;s folder and set up the priorities for the 
items in the folder (the next day&Ecirc;s to-do list). It is a good idea to make the first item 
something of high interest and relatively easy to accomplish; this creates a positive 
sense of achievement that may carry over into less interesting but necessary activities. 
At the end of each work week, again at the end of the day, go through the next week&Ecirc;s 
folder and sort the material into the appropriate folders by the day each item should be 
handled. Certainly setting up such a system takes some time, as does the daily review; 
however, as one of the authors can attest, it saves a surprising amount of time in the 
long run. 
</p>
<p> Interruptions are one of the most common reasons given for not having enough 
time at work. &bdquo;If it weren&Ecirc;t for all the interruptions I&Ecirc;d be fine,&permil; is a lament of many 
staff members. Interruptions cost time, even when they are warranted, because they </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16 2&mdash;Technical Services Administration
</p>
<p>fragment one&Ecirc;s activities. It always takes a few minutes to get back to where one left off 
in a task after the interruption. The three most frequent sources of interruptions are the 
telephone, colleagues dropping by, and checking to see if one has e-mail. Managing the 
telephone is easier to handle than workmates, but both can be done without offending 
people. 
</p>
<p> With telephone calls, batch the necessary ones and spend a few minutes planning 
each, asking &bdquo;What do I need to convey or learn.&permil; Make a list for each call and stick 
to it. Use a large pad of paper to keep all the notes and lists together. (Looking for the 
lunch napkin, business card, or empty envelope with the needed information is a great 
time waster.) Time management consultants often suggest that a business call should 
not require more than three minutes. 4  If the matter is too complex or detailed to handle 
in that time, consider some form of written communication. This is a useful guideline 
for most business calls, but there are exceptions, especially when developing or main-
taining a working relationship with someone in another organization, such as a library 
vendor or bindery firm. It is also good, if not always possible, to batch return calls. A 
useful approach to handling incoming calls, at least from other library staff members 
and those with whom you work, is to tell people &bdquo;the best time to call me is between x 
and y.&permil; Although this does not and should not stop calls from coming in at other times, it 
does, in time, lead to batching of many, if not most, incoming calls. During that calling 
time frame, engage in activities that take less concentration, making the interruptions 
less of a problem. Additional options to consider would be to automatically forward 
your phone to voicemail or to screen calls via the caller ID function on your phone, if 
these features are available, or to find an alternative work location if you are in an open 
office setting. Although these methods should not be relied upon constantly, they may 
be helpful during times when interruptions would be extremely counterproductive, such 
as when you are operating under a critical deadline. 
</p>
<p> E-mail can become almost as big a time waster as the telephone. To remedy this 
use the same approach to e-mail as to the telephone. Read and respond to these mes-
sages in batches. Don&Ecirc;t fall into the pattern of leaving your e-mail active all day or 
frequently checking to see whether there is mail if you want to make the most effective 
use of your time. 
</p>
<p> With colleagues, if at all possible, try to establish time frames when dropping by 
is welcome and times when dropping by is not welcome. For supervisors, it is a little 
easier to establish times when staff can come by with questions and some time during 
the day when the door is closed (even if there is no physical door to close). In smoothly 
running units, establishing such times for everyone is relatively easy. In times of change 
or uncertainty, creating such time is problematic, but even in those circumstances hav-
ing some private work time can be beneficial. However, supervisors need to make it 
clear that a closed-door time does not mean they are unavailable for unusual or emer-
gency situations. 
</p>
<p> Sometimes a person likes to engage in small talk before and after getting to the pur-
pose of a visit. Frequently these are also people who, if allowed, will spend more time 
on the informal and social aspects of the visit than on the issue in question. Setting time 
limits and sticking to them&middot;&bdquo;I can give you xx minutes&permil;&middot;is a sound method for any 
interruption, unless of course the person in question is a supervisor. However, a super-
visor should be as concerned about effective time usage as the person interrupted and 
should take no more time than necessary. Finally, there is nothing wrong with asking </p>

<p>Tips for Meetings 17
</p>
<p>people what it is they want to discuss, in a polite way, if they are having trouble getting 
to the point. 
</p>
<p> There are many other time management techniques, and several books on this topic 
are listed in the Suggested Reading section of this chapter. 
</p>
<p> TIPS FOR MEETINGS 
</p>
<p> Meetings are related to time management in the sense that they may be effective 
or a wasteful use of finite work time. Meetings are a given in the workplace. How well 
the convener structures and runs the meeting determines how useful the meeting will be 
for the attendees. It is rather common to hear a manager or supervisor say, &bdquo;All I do is 
attend meetings.&permil; In a formal teamwork environment, that statement might apply to all 
team members, as team meetings are essential to team success. Thus, having effective 
meetings is a key component in having unit productivity. 
</p>
<p> What makes for a useful meeting that does not waste time? Essentially, you should 
divide meetings into three broad steps&middot;before, during, and ending. The before aspect 
relates to planning&middot;(consisting of four Ps: purpose, people, place, preparation). First 
and foremost, consider what is the  purpose  of the meeting? Everyone has experienced 
mandatory-attendance meetings and left wondering, &bdquo;What was that all about?&permil; Without 
a clear purpose, no meeting will be a success; it is likely to start with vague comments, 
wander in a variety of directions, and end with no one certain why it was called. Who 
should attend (      people ) is also part of the planning process. Striking the correct balance 
between having too many attendees (people with little concern or interest in the topic) 
and too few (missing a key person) can be a challenge. Some people believe they should 
sit in on every meeting, regardless of topic, while others resist attending all but the most 
critical meetings. Where to hold the meeting ( place ) is a frequently overlooked element 
in the planning process. Meetings are very often held in spaces with no thought to how 
the space may affect its purpose. One obvious impact is the difference between a meet-
ing in the boss&Ecirc;s office and a meeting in a conference room. Place considerations can 
also include whether technology is needed at the meeting (to demonstrate a process or 
function) and whether the locale convenient to all participants. Also important is the 
furniture arrangement&middot;one arrangement may be conducive to peer interaction and an-
other may convey a power structure, for example. The final P is  preparation &middot;preparing 
an agenda, checking the space and any equipment that may be needed, and so on. When 
setting the agenda be sure to place the most important topic first and have clearly de-
fined outcome in mind. Too often time is wasted on less important topics just because 
they are high on the agenda. Another key part of preparation is letting attendees know 
what they should prepare to discuss. 
</p>
<p> During the meeting there are four Fs to consider&middot;focus, facilitation, feedback, 
and fellowship. A convener must keep the group on track (following agenda topics 
only, or gaining group consensus on how to deal with topics that may pop up). When 
the group loses its  focus,  time is wasted. Conveners must be  facilitators  and keep the 
group focused. What this means is to ensure that all attendees become part of the meet-
ing, even if it means calling on them. Presumably, assuming the convener addressed 
the four Ps, everyone in attendance is there because he has an interest or stake in the 
discussion. Thus, all voices should be heard. One technique for achieving this, without </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18 2&mdash;Technical Services Administration
</p>
<p>embarrassing anyone, is to say, &bdquo;Let&Ecirc;s take a moment to see where we stand. Let&Ecirc;s go 
around the room and get everyone&Ecirc;s thoughts.&permil; Providing positive  feedback  is a hall-
mark of a good convener. Even if the convener does not agree with an expressed view, 
she phrases her response in a way that will not crush further discussion. Some examples 
of how to respond are to say, &bdquo;Tell me more; how can we sell that to the boss?&permil; or &bdquo;Let&Ecirc;s 
combine our ideas to get the best solution.&permil; Having fun or feeling like a group member 
(          fellowship ), although not essential in all cases, can often enhance a meeting&Ecirc;s outcome. 
Lighten up meetings with laughter and humor whenever possible. You will be pleas-
antly surprised how much more effective the meetings become. 
</p>
<p> The ending portion of the meeting features the four Cs of completion&middot;consensus, 
closure, critique, and communication. Gaining group  consensus  on the outcome of the 
meeting (e.g., actions to take, decisions made) is an essential element in successful 
meetings. Too often a meeting ends with everyone thinking much was accomplished, but 
shortly afterward the attendees begin to wonder just what the outcome was. Providing a 
perceived view of the consensus helps everyone leave with a sense of accomplishment; 
it also gives the group a final chance to know if, in fact, there is consensus. Clearly, if 
there is to be consensus there must also be an understanding of the next steps ( closure ). 
Another challenge for many conveners is getting the meeting to end in the allotted time. 
If the prior four Ps and four Fs were addressed, however, ending on time should be no 
problem in most cases. It is when some aspects of planning and flow are poorly thought 
through that the endless meetings occur. Spending some time, with and without the 
group, going over what worked and did not work with the meeting ( critique ) will pay 
dividends for future meetings. The last step is to  communicate.  Part of that process is to 
have a record of what transpired, not word for word, but in broad brushstrokes. Sending 
a summary of the meeting to group members may bring to light something important 
that was overlooked. Finally, informing other interested parties about the outcome will 
build a sense of shared involvement if nothing else. 
</p>
<p> TIPS FOR TEAM BUILDING 
</p>
<p> The term  team  is used in a variety of ways, even when referring to a workplace 
concept. One definition of a workplace team that appears to capture the current work 
environment is a &bdquo;work group [that] is made up of individuals who see themselves and 
who are seen by others as a social entity, who are interdependent because of the tasks 
they perform as members of the group, who are embedded in one or more larger social 
systems, and who perform tasks that affect others.&permil; 5  Perhaps two more elements ought 
to be part of the definition&middot;team work groups develop a shared commitment to one 
another and are empowered to make decisions regarding their activities. 
</p>
<p> Teams take several approaches in terms of management style&middot;empowered, proj-
ect, and working are three of the most common types of teams.  Empowered  (or self-
managed) teams have a high degree of autonomy in some activity and are more or less 
permanent in character. An example of such a group might be a retrospective catalog-
ing team, if they have great latitude to determine their work activities.  Project  teams 
are assembled to carry out a specific task, usually with a target completion date. An 
example might be a PromptCat implementation team.  Working  teams are developed 
by supervisors to improve the cooperation or coordination of work activities within </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Tips for Team Building 19
</p>
<p>their areas of responsibility and to involve the staff in more of the unit&Ecirc;s planning and 
decision-making activities. In the first two types of teams, managers often implement 
a team-selection process that is designed to bring to the team people with the different 
skills needed to handle the assigned task. Working teams seldom start with a selection 
process, but over time the supervisor might adjust job descriptions to bring in new or 
missing skill sets to improve the team&Ecirc;s performance. 
</p>
<p> No matter what type of team is being considered, most of the elements of good 
team building apply. Good team building starts with creating two types of matrices: 
 skills  and  responsibilities.  Even when someone is not in a position to select team mem-
bers, it is useful to develop a skills matrix to identify the ideal skill sets. That way, if 
there is an opportunity to select a new person, one can quickly rewrite the appropriate 
job description. Such a matrix also helps one think about skill sets that exist in the work 
unit for meeting the existing responsibilities. It may even lead to reassigning duties 
among the existing staff. Table 2.1 illustrates a simplified responsibility matrix for han-
dling PromptCat.

</p>
<p> Teams in the workplace have been around for a long time in one form or another. 
They are not a new concept; however, they are playing an ever-greater role in how 
organizations get things done. Over the past 20-some years, organizations, including 
libraries, have undergone a flattening of their structures, resulting in fewer layers of 
management. In many cases, they experienced downsizing or received no increase in 
staffing, even with increased workloads. As a result of these events, the staff must be 
more productive, be flexible, learn new skills, and take on more responsibilities. So far, 
the 21st century has placed additional pressure on organizations and their personnel to 
be adept at handling rapid change with reduced resources. All of these factors place a 
premium on flexibility and having a knowledgeable workforce that is more capable of 
working independently than in the past. 
</p>
<p> Supervisors must get the best possible performance from their existing staff, and 
they must depend on team members to operate and solve problems, often on their own. 
(Fewer supervisors are available, and if work is to progress in a timely fashion, team 
members must act without waiting for assistance from higher-level personnel.) Al-
though the management fundamentals&middot;decision making, planning, organizing, and so 
on&middot;remain unchanged, there is a shift in who engages in these activities when true 
teams exist. 
</p>
<p> Some of the differences between a true team environment and a traditional work-
place are significant from a supervisor&Ecirc;s point of view. Teams call for consensus rather 
than command and control. They require acceptance of the idea that conflict (both </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Tips for Staff Motivation 21
</p>
<p>positive and negative) is a normal part of team operations, and those conflicts must be 
addressed in an open, honest manner. Although not every difference of opinion that oc-
curs in a team will result in negative conflict, time will still need to be spent in meetings 
to resolve problems or make decisions. Reaching decisions in a team setting tends to 
be more knowledge based than when it is done on the basis of one person&Ecirc;s opinion. In 
teams, more emphasis must be placed on the whys than on the hows. 
</p>
<p> Creating a team requires careful thought and an understanding of the work per-
sonalities of the potential team members. (Not all workers are comfortable working on 
a team.) The first step in team creation is determining how big the team should be and 
whom to select. The second step is to create an environment conducive to teamwork 
(empowerment and support). Establishing realistic goals is the third step. Providing 
training and development opportunities for team members is the fourth step&middot;although 
this step is ongoing in character. The last, and perhaps the most difficult step in using 
true teams, is for the supervisor/manager to let the team go and only become involved 
in team activities when asked to do so. 
</p>
<p> In addition, to setting clear goals and directions and establishing the right team en-
vironment, it is important to consider the tasks the team is to perform. The leader must 
be certain the tasks  require  teamwork. A common mistake, especially in first-time team 
environments, is creating a team in name only (the team has tasks, yes, but not those 
requiring teamwork). What happens is an appearance of teamwork, but in reality it is 
just individuals doing their own independent work. Making this mistake quickly leads 
to disillusionment on the part of both the team and the manager. Another fairly common 
mistake is assigning tasks that only occasionally call for teamwork. Although there will 
likely be times when team members need to work independently to produce a product 
that is shared by or ultimately benefits the entire team, assigning too many individual-
ized tasks to the team risks sending a mixed message and does not take advantage of the 
benefits of a team-based structure. 
</p>
<p> There is also the complex task of assessing team performance. This can be particu-
larly problematic when some staff members, those who are not a team, receive indi-
vidual performance reviews and team members are on a different system. In the minds 
of most people, performance reviews and salary increases are closely linked, so some 
will have difficulty accepting a team assignment knowing the group&Ecirc;s efforts will be 
assessed rather than individual work. 
</p>
<p> TIPS FOR STAFF MOTIVATION 
</p>
<p> Motivating staff is an ongoing process, and it seems much more challenging now 
than in the past. Budget cuts, staff reductions, unit reorganizations, and teams are just a 
few of the factors making it difficult to keep morale up. Almost any type of change in 
the work environment can create four stages of staff reactions, depending on the nature 
of the change: 
</p>
<p>  1. Disbelief, shock, and denial; 
  2. Anger, rage, and resentment; 
  3. Emotional bargaining&middot;where anger moves to depression; and finally 
  4. Acceptance </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22 2&mdash;Technical Services Administration
</p>
<p> During the first stage, people are often shocked that changes might or will take 
place. They believe the changes cannot or will not work, and some staff may actively 
work against the changes. Involving the staff and allowing them maximum input will 
help, as will providing honest and forthright explanations about what is involved in the 
proposed change. Indicating the benefits is also helpful. If there will be staff reductions, 
this should first be made clear to the staff involved in a private manner. Trying to hide 
such facts until later will damage credibility with the remaining staff. 
</p>
<p> In stage two, the initial denial and shock usually shift to anger, especially if there 
are to be staff reductions that require layoffs rather than normal attrition. That anger 
is normally focused on the immediate supervisor rather than the actual factor making 
the changes necessary. During the third stage, staff members likely to be affected by 
the change begin to start thinking about their options. Occasionally, some resign be-
fore there is any final decision. Often, these are the most qualified individuals who are 
less likely to lose their positions. Others become depressed, and their work quality and 
quantity begin to fall. Eventually, there is an acceptance that what seemed unthinkable 
will in fact take place. 
</p>
<p> Susan Cartwright and Cary Cooper identified 12 of the most common workplace 
stressors. 6  The technical services environment appears to have the potential to experi-
ence all 12 factors from time to time. The stressors are 
</p>
<p> &bull; loss of identity as organizational size changes; 
 &bull; lack of information, poor/inconsistent communication; 
 &bull; fear of job loss or demotion; 
 &bull; possible transfer/relocation; 
 &bull; loss of or reduced power, status, and prestige; 
 &bull; disrupted or uncertain career path; 
 &bull; change in rules, regulations, procedures, and reporting structure; 
 &bull; change in colleagues, supervisors, and subordinates; 
 &bull; ambiguous reporting systems, roles, and procedures; 
 &bull; devaluation of old skills and expertise; 
 &bull; personality/workplace culture clashes; and 
 &bull; increased workload. 
</p>
<p> Some factors are less controllable than others; for example, workload increases are 
often difficult to control at least in the short term. (Some of the steps to take to reduce 
the stress were discussed previously.) Providing more information can be very helpful; 
the word does not always get out as much as one might think, and what does get out is 
often less than accurate. Keep the communication process open to feedback; make it 
clear that questions and expressions of concern are welcome. Be as specific as possible 
about the whats, whys, whens, and wherefores of events or projects that may be stress-
ful. Involving staff in the process as much as possible helps them have a sense of control 
over their destiny. Work at developing a team approach, if not actual work teams. 
</p>
<p> The basics of team motivation do not vary much from that of individual employees. 
An underlying factor in everyone&Ecirc;s motivation to work is self-interest, if nothing more 
than working as a legal means of securing the money one needs to live. It is of course far 
more complex than that, but self-interest is a factor. Thus, the first difference in the team </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Tips for Communication 23
</p>
<p>environment is the need to keep self-interest to a minimum. Another difference is that 
the team will likely consist of members from different generations (baby boomers and 
Generation Xers, for example) who may be more or less inclined toward teamwork. 
</p>
<p> Monitoring team activities is an essential role for a manager or supervisor. When 
a team exhibits morale or productivity problems, the manager or supervisor must inter-
vene. If the poor morale is arising from a performance problem as a team, assisting the 
team with its problem solving to isolate the issue may lead to a solution. That will not 
resolve the poor morale by itself, but it will stop the performance problem from feeding 
the morale issue. It may be as simple as the timing of the resources needed for effective 
teamwork, for example, the flow of material from acquisitions to the catalog depart-
ment. On the other hand, the issue may be a nonperforming team member. When that is 
the case, the team may be hard pressed to resolve the matter on its own. 
</p>
<p> When morale is just starting to decline (moderate to low morale), several things 
can be done. One step is to model behavior that is positively geared toward success. If 
a manager can identify coachable areas in need of improvement, it is probably a good 
time for some serious coaching. Helping the team find one or two small and quick suc-
cesses almost always boosts morale. Having a team meeting and discussing the vision 
and its positive values may also make a difference for the better. Demonstrating com-
mitment to the vision and modeling that commitment will help team members buy into 
that vision. Such discussions may also lead to revelations about what may be causing a 
decline in morale, assuming you are an effective listener. Listening is a major compo-
nent in effective communication. 
</p>
<p> TIPS FOR COMMUNICATION 
</p>
<p> Given the current work environment, team-based technical services activities that 
cut across traditional activity lines are more likely to produce positive results and re-
quire effective communication. Good teams should have the following characteristics: 
</p>
<p> &bull; A broad range of skills and cross training 
 &bull; Strong senior management support 
 &bull; Greater than traditional latitude in determining work activities 
 &bull; A commitment to being well-informed 
</p>
<p> Effective communication&middot;speaking, writing, and listening&middot;is the glue of suc-
cessful team functionality. Group commitment, decision making, problem solving, 
conflict resolution, and accountability all rest on the quality of the communication that 
occurs in the team. Team members who understand and follow four communication 
rules find themselves, more often than not, on great teams. 
</p>
<p>  &bull; Rule one: Be open and honest with one another.  This leads to vulnerabil-
ity; being open and honest almost always generates a greater commitment 
to one another. 
</p>
<p>  &bull; Rule two: Be clear and concise.  Trying to show off one&Ecirc;s vocabulary tends 
to turn off listeners and makes the real message harder to identify. Being 
long-winded does little but eat up valuable team time. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24 2&mdash;Technical Services Administration
</p>
<p>  &bull; Rule three: Maintain consistency.  This does not mean being unwilling to 
compromise or to admit to being wrong about something. However, con-
stantly changing views or positions raises doubts about a person and may 
lead to less trust. 
</p>
<p>  &bull; Rule four: Be civil and courteous and show respect for others and their 
views.  
</p>
<p> Teams that follow these rules in their communication with one another, with the leader, 
with other units or teams, and with the public are likely to achieve great things. 
</p>
<p> People often slip into the habit of thinking of communication as a one-way process 
based on oral and written messages sent and received. To be truly effective, commu-
nication must be based on a two-way feedback process to prevent misunderstandings 
and to clarify points. Even when remembering that communication is two way in na-
ture, people frequently forget the importance of  listening  and thinking  before  providing 
feedback. 
</p>
<p> Listening is an art that many people need to practice more than they do and one 
that some people never seem to develop. One reason is that we tend to forget that we 
can hear at least four times faster than most people normally speak. so the difference 
between speaking and listening speeds allows ample time for the listener&Ecirc;s mind to 
wander away from the speaker&Ecirc;s message. If in doubt about this difference, take a few 
minutes to think carefully about the last lecture or speech you attended. Did you really 
only think about the presentation? Or did you also think about the quality of the pre-
sentation? Did you think about what you needed to do after the presentation was over? 
Did you doodle on the page if you were taking notes? Did you think about the room, 
the people, or what the weather was like outside? The list could go on and on. The point 
is that any such thoughts take your attention away from the message and illustrate that 
listening speed was not taxed to any great extent by the presentation. 
</p>
<p> Improving listening skills is necessary for effective team performance. Tips for 
improving listening include (1) thinking about questions the presentation or the speaker 
brings to mind that need to be raised for clarification; (2) asking for examples or pro-
viding paraphrased feedback during the presentation; (3) concentrating on what is new, 
different, or questionable; and (4) summarizing the key points after the presentation, 
which is a way of concentrating attention on the message being delivered and not allow-
ing one&Ecirc;s mind to wander to other matters. 
</p>
<p> The communication process has a passive side as well. Nonverbal behavior can 
be almost as important, if not the most significant part of the communication process. 
Speakers and listeners both pick up on the nonverbal behaviors or cues and may have 
very different reactions to those behaviors. Libraries are becoming more and more di-
verse in terms of staff and the end-users served. Communication is a process highly 
influenced by cultural and societal factors. Although we are more likely to think about 
the importance of our word choice in a diverse environment, we sometimes overlook 
the nonverbal issues. 
</p>
<p> Three examples illustrate the point about cultural differences and nonverbal behav-
ior. Generally in Western European societies, direct eye contact during a conversation is 
considered a sign of a listening, open, straightforward, honest person. Lack of such eye 
contact suggests the opposite. However, in other cultures, direct eye contact is seen as 
insulting, disrespectful, and even threatening. Likewise, European-based patterns expect </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The &ldquo;More&rdquo; Factor 25
</p>
<p>some nonverbal signals that the person is listening, such as nodding in agreement. In 
some cultures, such behavior is not expected or is even viewed as presumptuous on 
the listener&Ecirc;s part. Physical space during a conversation is also a factor. Some societies 
expect people to be up close and personal, while in others such behavior is viewed as 
pushy and rude. Knowing something about the expected communication behavior of 
the various cultures represented in the team or workplace can be beneficial for overall 
working relationships and productivity. (A note about diversity: The Loyola Marymount 
University [LMU] Library PromptCat team consisted of 11 members of the cataloging 
and acquisitions departments. In terms of cultural diversity there were two people from 
the Philippines, one from India, one from Taiwan, one from Japan, one Chinese Ameri-
can, and one Latino, with the balance from Western European backgrounds. Clearly, to 
work effectively the team had to address different communication styles.) 
</p>
<p> There are times when personal influence is not enough, and negotiating will be 
necessary to achieve the desired results. Negotiating should be, both within the group 
and with other units, a process of give and take. Before starting negotiations it is advis-
able to have a clear understanding of what the bottom line is for each party involved, 
that is, what cannot be modified. In the workplace setting, there are usually at least 
three bottom lines. First is the institutional goal of what must take place&middot;for example, 
PromptCat  must  be implemented in a cost-effective manner. Second is a goal the staff 
desires&middot;for example, any new process  must not  result in added workload but rather be 
a replacement. A third bottom line is that of the manager or supervisor&middot;the outcome 
 must  be something he can be comfortable with implementing. Following are some ne-
gotiating tips: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Differentiating between wants, needs, and musts is required for all sides. 
 &bull; Asking high and giving low is expected, but don&Ecirc;t be ridiculous about either 
</p>
<p>end. 
 &bull; Conceding something, which is necessary if there is to be negotiation, is also 
</p>
<p>expected, but when doing so don&Ecirc;t simply give in. 
 &bull; Winning something and losing something is the goal of negotiations; no side 
</p>
<p>should leave believing it has lost on every issue 
</p>
<p> Supervising or administering a unit in technical services calls for the same basic 
management skills and knowledge as any other unit in the library. However, some of 
those basic skills are being called upon with ever-increasing frequency as libraries try 
to adjust to a changing external environment. Some of the skills that need to come into 
play more often are managing change, fostering innovation and creativity, containing 
costs, building teams, and motivating staff. 
</p>
<p> THE &ldquo;MORE&rdquo; FACTOR 
</p>
<p> Some years ago Cecily Johns wrote that the motto for cataloging and technical 
services is and always will be &bdquo;more, better, cheaper, faster.&permil; 7  These are shorthand labels 
for what administrators of technical services units must constantly address, and they are 
just as relevant now as when Johns first wrote them. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26 2&mdash;Technical Services Administration
</p>
<p> For most libraries in the 1980s and early 1990s, &bdquo;more&permil; did not mean a higher 
volume of books and serials to acquire, catalog, and process. The &bdquo;more&permil; was the ex-
panding range of material formats that had to be dealt with on a regular basis. A seem-
ingly constantly changing information industry created, and occasionally dropped, new 
formats for delivering material, which generated pressures on technical services units to 
keep evolving. Electronic materials quickly demonstrated that libraries had to gear up to 
handle not only constant change but also very rapid shifts in direction. 
</p>
<p> As both a library school educator and library administrator for many years, one 
of the authors, Dr. Evans, has experienced those events from the classroom/conceptual 
point of view and the &bdquo;how are we going to deal with this development&permil; practical per-
spective. The factors noted in chapter 1 as leading to the changing shape of technical 
services&middot;economic, technological, and financial&middot;make it difficult for practitioners 
to keep abreast of the shifting landscape of information resources and still get their 
work done. 
</p>
<p> Whereas public, school, and community college libraries have a long history of 
acquiring and building collections of audiovisual and nonbook formats, the same is not 
true of large academic libraries. With the proliferation of electronic databases, even the 
largest research libraries are adding formats that 15 to 20 years ago were considered 
inappropriate for their collections. 
</p>
<p> THE FASTER/BETTER/CHEAPER FACTORS 
</p>
<p> Certainly the Internet has contributed significantly to the &bdquo;more&permil; factor. On the 
plus side, it has also helped with the faster and better factors. Think of the Internet as 
just another tool, rather like the machine-readable cataloging (MARC) format, that fa-
cilitates more effective use of time and effort. 
</p>
<p> For example, in the not-so-distant past, libraries often compared working prac-
tices and policies by conducting field trips or site visits to neighboring libraries. Al-
though such trips still occur, they are becoming rare. In their place, staff use the Internet, 
through e-mail systems and discussion lists, to post questions such as, &bdquo;How do you 
handle x?&permil; In addition to saving travel time and expenses, responses often come in 
from around the world, and staff can draw on a much wider range of experience. Fur-
thermore, discussion lists help keep the staff informed about new developments and 
issues. Technical services librarians and senior paraprofessional staff usually subscribe 
to several such lists. 
</p>
<p> Everything covered in this book has one or more Web sites devoted to it. There are 
URLs throughout the book, but these addresses are likely to have changed by the time 
you read this&middot;the average life span for a Web site is under 24 months. Still, a good 
starting point, no matter what library topic is of interest, is the Internet Library for Li-
brarians (http://www.itcompany.com/inforetriever). 
</p>
<p> Although collection development is of only passing interest for this book, a num-
ber of Web sites are useful to both collection development staff and acquisitions person-
nel. These range from information producer Web sites (an example is the Association 
of American University Presses at http://aaupnet.org) to general online vendors such as </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Faster/Better/Cheaper Factors 27
</p>
<p>Amazon (http://www.amazon.com). Looking for an out-of-print title? Try Bibliofind 
(now a subsidiary of Amazon) at http://www.bibliofind.com. Sites like the last two pro-
vide links to reviews and other information and have ordering capabilities. A few offer 
Boolean searching in addition to the expected author, title, publisher, and International 
Standard Book Number (ISBN) searches. 
</p>
<p> A specific example of how technology assists in the faster/better side of acquisi-
tions work is in letting end-users know what new titles are ready for use. Years ago, 
many libraries&middot;academic, public, and special, in particular&middot;issued some type of re-
cent additions or new titles lists. Producing such lists was labor intensive: collecting the 
slips for recently processed titles, typing the list, verifying that the information was cor-
rect, maintaining a mailing list for interested recipients, and producing and distributing 
the information. By the mid-1980s such lists were disappearing as libraries struggled 
with budget and staff reductions. End-users voiced concerns about the loss and ques-
tioned the factors that led to dropping the lists. 
</p>
<p> Such lists are making a comeback thanks to technology. Many systems make it 
possible to run a management report that lists all the titles added to the database be-
tween x and y dates. Most allow downloading of the information into a word-processing 
program where a staff member can quickly format the data for publication. The end 
product is often a paper list and an electronic version for posting on the library&Ecirc;s Web 
site. Another step can be to e-mail specific information such as the &bdquo;item is ready for 
use&permil; to the requestor and others who have an interest in the topic. This is a return to what 
was part of a service called selective dissemination of information back when there was 
staffing available for such activities. 
</p>
<p> Serial publications have always been a challenge for library staff because of their 
changing nature. (Years ago they were thought to be  the  challenge, but technology has 
assumed that mantle.) New titles, changing titles, variations in numbering systems, 
special issues, delays in publications, suspension of publication, and ceasing to exist 
are but a few of the challenges serials present to libraries. Keeping up to date in a 
print-only environment was almost impossible, but the Internet makes it  almost  pos-
sible. Anyone with an interest in serials should subscribe to SERIALST (http://www.
uvm.edu/~bmaclenn/serialst.html), an open forum for discussing the perplexing world 
of serials. Because subscribers are from around the world&middot;more than 40 countries are 
represented&middot;one quickly learns that many, if not most, of the concerns about serials are 
global rather than local in character. Electronic journals and/or paper-based titles with 
electronic editions represent another challenge for technical services. Some vendors 
have records that can be downloaded, assuming that the integrated library system (ILS) 
allows for that and can make the necessary links. For many libraries, if the process de-
pended solely on manual inputting, there would be many fewer records for electronic 
resources. 
</p>
<p> Cataloging departments and catalogers have been online for longer than most oth-
ers in the library world. A popular discussion list for catalogers is AUTOCAT (http://
listserv.syr.edu/archives/autocat.html), initiated many years ago by list owner Judith 
Hopkins of the State University of New York at Buffalo. Cataloging questions often 
elicit dozens of responses, sometimes within hours of being posted. Opinions and 
answers come from all over the world, sometimes with documentation. Some of the 
most prolific participants work at national libraries, research institutions, or specialized </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28 2&mdash;Technical Services Administration
</p>
<p>information centers. The Canadian counterpart to AUTOCAT is the Canadian Library 
Association Technical Services Interest Group Forum, TSIG-L. It can be located via 
the Canadian Library Association Web site at http://www.cla.ca, or at http://www3.fis.
utoronto.ca/people/affiliated/tsig. 
</p>
<p> Catalogers are frequently able to obtain authoritative information, free catalog-
ing advice, selected tools, and other assistance from Web sites maintained by national 
libraries and bibliographic networks as well as by commercial vendors of cataloging 
systems, publishers, and other companies. Some of the most useful government and 
nonprofit organization Web sites are the Library of Congress Cataloging and Ac-
quisitions Web site (http://www.loc.gov/aba/), the Library and Archives Canada Web 
site (http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/), and the OCLC Web site (http://www.oclc.
org). Offerings at these Web sites vary from organization to organization and change 
over time, but typical features include descriptions of the organization&Ecirc;s latest ac-
tivities and projects, lists of publications and online order forms, and e-mail access 
to persons responsible for answering inquiries or providing additional information. 
Occasionally, full text of some documents or methods of downloading them free of 
charge are posted. Early in 2001, OCLC began giving an online course for a fee on 
cataloging Internet resources. Since that time, a number of resources for technical 
services librarians have been made available, such as those found on the OCLC Web-
Junction Technical Services resources site (http://www.webjunction.org/technical-
services/). 
</p>
<p> The Internet is a great tool, but it can also present a problem in that the staff can 
spend a little too much time surfing it. Some control and self-monitoring is necessary 
to maintain unit productivity. However, allowing some level of surfing may help reduce 
some of the workplace stress that is so common in the changing technical services 
environment. Also, staff members need to become comfortable with the electronic da-
tabases the library purchases to provide proper service. 
</p>
<p> RESTRUCTURING TO PROVIDE &ldquo;FASTER AND BETTER&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> Pressure for more, better, faster, cheaper, combined with budget woes and, all too 
frequently, staff reductions have led to restructuring of technical services units. A buzz-
word for this is &bdquo;reengineering.&permil; Close inspection of what the gurus of reengineering 
suggest reveals that the concept has much in common with what was once labeled 
&bdquo;operations analysis&permil; and &bdquo;scientific management.&permil; Good management practice calls 
for ongoing assessment and evaluation of policies, procedures, workflow, and so forth. 
Unfortunately, in most situations daily demands seem to keep people from doing this 
on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p> You don&Ecirc;t need to hire an outsider to handle many of the basic techniques of work 
analysis. If you seriously think about each of the following questions, you will be well 
on your way to creating an effective and efficient unit: 
</p>
<p> &bull; What is done? 
 &bull; Why is it done? 
 &bull; Where is it done? 
 &bull; When is it done? </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Standards 29
</p>
<p> &bull; Who does it? 
 &bull; How is it done? 
</p>
<p> An excellent text to help with rethinking operations is Richard Dougherty&Ecirc;s  Stream-
lining Library Services.  8  The book is a greatly revised and updated version of the classic 
Dougherty wrote many years ago. 
</p>
<p> An example of planning and rethinking activities is the implementation of Prompt-
Cat, which calls for a planning team of catalogers and acquisition staff. The process is 
not as complicated as a merge, but it can be more contentious because it often demon-
strates that neither unit really understands what the other does. 
</p>
<p> One challenge that arises when it comes to merging or starting a program such as 
PromptCat is the question of quality control and what that means in a particular library. 
In the case of outsourcing copy cataloging (PromptCat), many units have some interest 
as the data from the outside agency become a part of the library&Ecirc;s online public access 
catalog (OPAC). Often there are staff members who believe no effort should be spared 
to create an error-free OPAC, while others believe perfection is impossibly expensive 
and does not serve the end-user in the long run. 
</p>
<p> STANDARDS 
</p>
<p> OPACs are the end-user&Ecirc;s key to unlocking the library&Ecirc;s resources and, in some 
cases, the resources of other libraries. They play a more prominent role for users than 
did the card catalogs of years gone by, if for no other reason than that they generally 
offer more modes of access and are considered quicker and easier to use than their fore-
runners. Given their importance to quality customer service, it is a good practice to have 
just one unit responsible for OPAC maintenance. 
</p>
<p> One long-standing management technique for assigning task responsibility is to 
give it to the unit or person who most frequently performs the task. The catalog depart-
ment creates the initial bibliographic record for each new title and item records for ad-
ditional copies or volumes in a set that ultimately constitutes the core of the database. 
Thus, it is rather common that the cataloging unit is responsible for maintaining the 
database content and its quality. 
</p>
<p> If it is just a matter of initial inputting of data, the task would be of less concern; 
however, it goes far beyond that. There are ongoing adjustments that must be, should 
be, or are desirable to make in the existing records. On the &bdquo;must&permil; side is indicating 
changes in the location information, say from open stacks to storage. Another must is 
deleting records for withdrawn or lost items. A &bdquo;should be&permil; issue is cross-linking dif-
ferent records for works by a single author who has several name variations. One of 
the most desired adjustments, but one that is not implemented as often as staff would 
like, is updating subject headings, which seem to change on a regular basis. Handling 
the changes manually eats up limited staff time. If the ILS does not provide updating 
capability, some libraries have found it cost-effective to outsource the work. In many 
ways, the process of deciding what is not an error is difficult. It may require months 
of discussion before there is agreement on items that can be less than perfect and still 
go into the OPAC. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>30 2&mdash;Technical Services Administration
</p>
<p> Standards are a good starting point for anyone thinking about outsourcing. An ex-
ample of a standard created by a technical services unit is illustrated in Table 2.2. The 
LMU library uses the chart for handling incoming PromptCat items. The basic concept 
underlying the chart is that the standards should be clear enough so persons who have 
no cataloging background can quickly review incoming materials and decide if they are 
acceptable or require the attention of the cataloging staff. (See chapter 14 for a discus-
sion of MARC tags.)    
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> The management issues in today&Ecirc;s technical services environment are essentially 
the same as for other areas of the library: too much to do, too few people to do what 
must be done, and constant pressure to do more with less. Basic management practices 
are key elements in making the &bdquo;more, faster, better, cheaper&permil; pressures somewhat more 
manageable. A host of management resources are available for technical services staffs

<p>Notes 31
</p>
<p>to consult. This chapter covers only a few of the topics; management of organizations in 
times of change and stress is the subject of a great many full-length books. 
</p>
<p> It does not appear likely that the library work environment is going to change much 
from the present circumstances in the very near future. Concepts of time and stress 
management are helpful for all staff. Developing ways of sorting out what is essential, 
desirable, and nice to have with all staff members is also worthwhile. Creating even an 
informal sense of team membership prevents members from feeling as if they are alone. 
Working on communication and negotiating skills promotes a work environment that 
is effective and somewhat, if not completely, comfortable for everyone.

<p> Staffi ng 
</p>
<p> The proliferation of e-resources has led to the emergence of new service par-
adigms and new roles for staff. 
</p>
<p> &middot;William Curran, 2006 
</p>
<p> Have the requirements for jobs in technical services changed? What qualifica-
tions are necessary to obtain professional positions in technical services? 
</p>
<p> &middot;JoAnne Deekan and Deborah Thomas, 2006 
</p>
<p> Most libraries will have limited use for catalogers whose education has focused 
narrowly on electronic resources and metadata. Unfortunately, recent discus-
sions with library school students and recent graduates suggests that some stu-
dents may be receiving the impression that there is a significant market for 
people with just such a restricted focus. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Janet Swan Hill, 2005 
</p>
<p> Although a library may have solid funding and a new building, without great people 
its services will be inadequate. People are the key to a library&Ecirc;s success, not the technol-
ogy, not the collections, and not its physical environment. Certainly, all the latter factors 
are important, but it is how well the staff members perform their duties that makes users 
think &bdquo;their&permil; library is one of the best. What many people, both in and out of the profes-
sion, tend to forget is that it is the entire staff that makes the difference, not just those in 
public services. Quality begins in the back room&middot; technical services. 
</p>
<p> Gaining the services of the best and brightest people is a process that requires 
thoughtful planning. When it comes to hiring people who will provide outstanding ser-
vice, you must think and plan even more carefully. People are the key to providing </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36 3&mdash;Staffing
</p>
<p>successful service&middot;people who are thoughtfully selected, people who are given proper 
support and ongoing training, and most important, people who really do like people. 
</p>
<p> Hire happy people. That may sound platitudinous and rather silly. However, re-
search has shown that it does in fact make a difference in customer service and satisfac-
tion. &bdquo;The bigger the employee&Ecirc;s smile, the happier the customer. That is the conclusion 
of new research from Bowling Green and Penn State Universities. . . . If a manager 
wants employees to deliver service with a smile, they can do better than mandate it. 
They should create an environment that encourages genuine smiles.&permil; 1  
</p>
<p> Sometimes those of us working in libraries, forget that our users are our real em-
ployers. These are the people who really fund our paychecks. Providing them with the 
best possible service, within our power, is the least we can do. David Drickhamer sug-
gested that managers who &bdquo;believe as a matter of faith that if they take care of their 
employees&middot;offering continuous training, regularly assessing performance, and treat 
them with the same respect with which they would like to be treated&middot;those employees 
will help deliver superior performance. Lo and behold, it&Ecirc;s true.&permil; 2  
</p>
<p> STAFFING CATEGORIES 
</p>
<p> For most of the general public, anyone working in the library is a &bdquo;librarian.&permil; Ac-
tually libraries, like most other organizations, utilize several categories of employees. 
The labels for the categories vary from library to library; however, there are four basic 
groups: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Full-time employees who have a master&Ecirc;s degree in library and information 
science (MLS) and/or a subject graduate degree (librarians/professionals/
subject specialists) 
</p>
<p> &bull; Full-time employees with degrees ranging from high school to postgraduate 
(paraprofessional, nonprofessional, support staff, library assistant, technical 
assistant, library media technical assistant, and clerical staff are some of the 
more common titles) 
</p>
<p> &bull; Part-time employees with or without a degree (pages, shelvers, interns, stu-
dent assistants, volunteers) 
</p>
<p> &bull; Volunteers 
</p>
<p> Starting in the 1960s, an ever-increasing volume of literature examined the ques-
tion of library staffing categories, job titles, job duties, and related issues. The interest in 
the topic has grown substantially since the 1970s. Part of the reason for the increasing 
coverage arises from the factors discussed in chapter 1 relating to the changing nature 
of library activities. To a large degree, what has been taking place is summed up in a 
statement by Michael Gorman: &bdquo;No librarian should do a job a paraprofessional can do, 
no paraprofessional should do a job that a clerical staff member can do, and no human 
being should do a job a machine can do.&permil; 3  
</p>
<p> The chapter epigraph from William Curran also reflects what is taking place. Bud-
get reductions, downsizing, technology, and changing staffing patterns all create an 
environment of uncertainty, tension, and often fear. Add to that mix variable beliefs or 
understandings about the types of work and who should do what, when, and how, and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Staffing Categories 37
</p>
<p>there are bound to be concerns about employment security and what jobs will exist in 
the future as well as the labels associated with those positions. Liz Lane and Barbara 
Stewart have correctly noted that &bdquo;many staff members are being assigned higher-level 
work which then require an upward reclassification of jobs in the automated technical 
services environment. Work previously done at lower levels has either become auto-
mated, outsourced to a library vendor, or is not done anymore.&permil; 4  
</p>
<p> Librarians 
</p>
<p> In the current information world, the differences between a librarian and a parapro-
fessional are probably most apparent in the human resources (HR) department rather 
than within the library. The reason for HR&Ecirc;s ability to differentiate between the two is 
that it maintains the job descriptions, position holder&Ecirc;s name, and salary classifications. 
None of these attributes is apparent on a daily basis in the library. On the floor, espe-
cially for the users, it is almost impossible to know who holds what job title. William 
Curran indicated that three-quarters of the libraries in his survey reported that the need 
for paraprofessionals to perform tasks once done by librarians had increased over the 
previous five years, and that they also expected the trend would continue for at least 
five more years. Curran noted, &bdquo;A redefinition of roles and expectations is needed. The 
level of competencies in information technology as well as the constant upgrading of 
equipment create expectations on the part of library users and invite professional and 
paraprofessional staff into a new routine of duties and responsibilities.&permil; 5  
</p>
<p> People holding positions designated as &bdquo;librarian&permil; generally have an MLS. &bdquo;Gen-
erally&permil; is an important word in the preceding sentence. School libraries, when they 
have a librarian, usually require that person to hold a teaching certificate with some 
coursework in librarianship. Many large research libraries have bibliographic or subject 
librarians or administrators who may hold a graduate degree in their assigned subject 
area. Finally, some librarians may have satisfied a frequent phrase in position advertise-
ments&middot;&bdquo;MLS or equivalent required.&permil; Just what is &bdquo;equivalent&permil; varies from institution 
to institution. However, the vast majority of librarians do in fact have an MLS degree. 
</p>
<p> In 1992, Paula Kaufman noted that the categories used to classify library employ-
ees &bdquo;can create problems, tensions, and conflicts between library nonprofessional and 
professional staffs.&permil; 6  These tensions, at least in technical services, go back to at least the 
mid-1960s and the movement to create computerized processing centers. 
</p>
<p> Paraprofessional/Support Staff 
</p>
<p> If the definition of librarian appears rather vague, deciding on a label and required 
background for those holding nonlibrarian positions in libraries is even fuzzier. Years 
ago Elin Christianson reported on the various labels used to designate nonlibrarian per-
sonnel and attitudes about those labels. 7  The list included clerk/clerical, library aide, 
library associate, library assistant, library clerk, library technician, nonprofessional, 
paraprofessional, supportive/support, and subprofessional. The only label that did not 
elicit at least a few negative responses from those holding such positions was library 
technician. Paraprofessional had only a few negative comments, and today there would 
likely be none, given the rise of groups such as paralegals, paramedics, and so on. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>38 3&mdash;Staffing
</p>
<p> A journal for people in these ranks was  Library Mosaics,  and its editorial staff con-
sistently used the label paraprofessional. (We were saddened to see it cease publication 
at the end of 2005. However, its back files have a wealth of information for anyone in-
terested in this field.) Perhaps the Council on Library/Media Technicians (COLT; http://
colt.ucr.edu) and/or the American Library Association&Ecirc;s (ALA) Library Support Staff 
Interests Round Table (LSSIRT; http://www.ala.org/ala/lssirt) will fill in the void left by 
the passing of  Library Mosaics.  Clearly, there is still no consensus as to what the label 
for nonlibrarian positions should be. This is probably due to a lack of agreement about 
what training/education is required to hold such positions. We prefer either paraprofes-
sional or support staff. 
</p>
<p> Support staff members are the backbone of library services. Without them, few 
libraries could offer the variety and quality of services that they do. &bdquo;According to the 
2004 statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) 230,843 work-
ers are employed in U.S. academic and public libraries. Of these, 160,150 (69%) are 
library support staff.&permil; 8  The total number of support staff is even greater when one adds 
those in school and special libraries. 
</p>
<p> What type of background is called for to fill nonlibrarian positions now that those 
employees often perform duties and carry responsibilities that were once the sole do-
main of MLS holders? Like so many questions, the answer is, it depends. Ideally, indi-
viduals who perform such work would have, and many do have, extensive education, 
training, and library experience. Without a doubt, having a degree from a program that 
focuses on library and information services, in all their forms, is very valuable. Some-
one who has the ability, interest, and desire to grow and learn on the job can also fill 
such positions in time. Although having a supervisor who encourages and trains people 
is a wonderful asset, a person can independently gain the requisite knowledge and skills 
through workshops, online opportunities, and formal classes. (Note that some entry-
level positions require no prior library experience or knowledge, are clerical in nature, 
and should not carry the label paraprofessional or library technician.) 
</p>
<p> People usually think of their work in one of two ways&middot;as a job or as a career. 
Job-oriented individuals only focus on the assigned duties. They often perform those 
responsibilities at an extremely high level and are a very valuable organizational re-
source. However, when their work shift ends, so does their interest in the organization. 
They have more important interests. Career-oriented people, on the other hand, have 
a strong interest in their organization and an interest in the field in general. They are 
quick to volunteer to take on new tasks, especially those that offer an opportunity to 
learn a new skill or gain new knowledge. Because of their interest in the organization, 
they offer suggestions for improvements and accept committee assignments willingly. 
Career-oriented individuals form the core of paraprofessional ranks. Note, however, 
that career-oriented persons, when overworked and undersupported, can quickly be-
come job oriented. This is something all good supervisors attempt to avoid and try to 
point out to more senior managers when they observe such mistreatment. 
</p>
<p> For the career-oriented person, the LSSIRT has created the  Task Force on Career 
Ladders.  9  This document, and the companion  Continuing Education &amp; Training Op-
portunities  publication, 10  are useful to review and should be thoughtfully considered. As 
the  Career Ladders  work indicates, &bdquo;career development shifts the responsibility to the 
individual and away from the organization.&permil; 11  It goes on to point out that libraries have </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Staffing Categories 39
</p>
<p>an obligation in this area as well, such as providing opportunities for skill development, 
promotions, and the chance to put new skills to use. 
</p>
<p> A key point was made in the LSSIRT Training statement: &bdquo;Although there has 
been rapid development of electronic databases, the Internet, and other resources, there 
has not been nearly enough training for the staff who must use these resources.&permil; 12  The 
authors go on to suggest that &bdquo;there should be standard core competencies for all levels 
of support staff.&permil; 13  The Support Staff Section of the Connecticut Library Association 
developed such a competency list&middot;both for all staff and for some areas of service, 
for example public services (http://ctlibraryassociation.org/archive/class.html). Many 
of their general staff competencies are ones you would expect to find in any list of de-
sirable staff traits&middot;positive attitude toward users, being open to change, having good 
communication skills, and being willing and able to work independently. Below are the 
11 competencies for public service staff: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Ability to introduce users to all library services 
 &bull; Ability to use the entire library collection to satisfy user requests 
 &bull; Knowledge of library&Ecirc;s circulation system and public access catalog 
 &bull; Knowledge of fine and fee policies, and cash and security procedures 
 &bull; Knowledge of basic reference and information resources and referral 
</p>
<p>procedures 
 &bull; Knowledge of available community resources 
 &bull; Knowledge of library copyright requirements 
 &bull; Knowledge of library classification system with the ability to do shelving and 
</p>
<p>shelf reading 
 &bull; Familiarity with reader&Ecirc;s advisory issues and resources 
 &bull; Familiarity with ILL [interlibrary loan] procedures 
 &bull; Ability to deal with disruptive patrons and emergency situations 
</p>
<p> As of 2008, the ALA is undertaking a certification program for support staff. Learn 
more about this program at the Library Support Staff Certification Program Web site 
(http://ala-apa.org/lssc/). 
</p>
<p> Other Full-Time Staff 
</p>
<p> There are a variety of full-time employees who work in libraries but do not fall 
into the previous two categories. The most obvious are clerical staff, such as reception-
ists and secretaries. These are job categories that only require general office skills&middot;a 
person does not need to have any prior background in library operations to carry out the 
job functions. Other clerical positions might include processing and mailing notices to 
users (overdue and document delivery information, for example) or maintaining order 
in the current magazine and newspaper area. 
</p>
<p> A library may also employ a bookkeeper, whose only special library knowledge is 
likely to be the concept of encumbrance; but even that is not unique to the library en-
vironment. Someone with a general background in bookkeeping can quickly step into 
a library administrative office and handle the budget record-keeping activities. Only </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40 3&mdash;Staffing
</p>
<p>if the person is to handle the financial records for the acquisitions department would 
she need to understand the principles of encumbering funds. In larger libraries, there 
may be some information technology staff that handle networking/server maintenance 
and the like, and who have no responsibility for specific library technologies. The very 
largest libraries are likely to have other professional positions, such as fund-raising 
specialists, training officers, marketing and public relations people, or HR personnel 
who may or may not have an MLS. (We cover part-time and volunteer personnel later 
in this chapter.) 
</p>
<p> Shannon Hoffman suggested that clerical staff provide general office skills, while 
shelvers (or part-time personnel) perform a variety of very routine but essential tasks. 14  
She further proposed that &bdquo;paralibrarians&permil; would be a preferable term for those with 
library training but less than an MLS. &bdquo;This title is a title that would command respect 
and understanding by the public. Now is the time for the librarians to give more support 
to paraprofessionals and establish them with an appropriate title. By this means librar-
ians can project themselves forward in the quest for professionalism.&permil; 15  
</p>
<p> One reason for covering all library staff in this discussion is technology or infor-
mation communication technology (ICT). Over the years this book has been available 
(1971 to the present), there has been a profound shift in staffing patterns, as technol-
ogy has become an ever more dominant feature in the daily work patterns of library 
staff. In fact, ICT has become so integrated to the work flow that when the system has 
problems, or goes down, work almost comes to a complete stop. ICT has changed work 
requirements, skills, and who does what. It has also made the case for cross-training 
and/or teamwork crystal clear, thus, further blurring job distinctions. Libraries are their 
increasing use of empowered teams that are composed of a variety of job categories. 
(Empowered teams have decision-making powers.) ICT and other factors have resulted 
in a flattening of the traditional hierarchy of library organizations. 
</p>
<p> One impact of a changing economic picture and new technologies is that library 
staff sizes have remained relatively constant in spite of increased user demands and 
expectations. Technology allows public-service personnel to handle changing and, in a 
few cases, increased, workloads without additional people. Occasionally, it has allowed 
some libraries to shift positions from technical to public services. 
</p>
<p> Libraries require a much wider variety of skill sets than they did even 5 or 50 years 
ago. Budget restraints in turn create situations in which public service staff must be able 
to fill in for one another (cross-training). Technology also brings with it the need for 
constant training, as it seems to change every day. 
</p>
<p> STAFFING PROCESS 
</p>
<p> Selecting appropriate staff, regardless of category&middot;full-time, part-time, and even 
volunteers&middot;requires significant time, planning, and effort. Although few libraries have 
an HR unit, library staff do become involved in the HR process on an operational level, 
so this chapter includes a short discussion of the major HR issues. During a library 
career, a person is likely to be involved in all of the issues covered from time to time. 
Understanding some of the key points of the recruitment and selection process is useful 
when you are looking for a job and when you are asked to serve on a search committee. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Staffing Process 41
</p>
<p>A supervisor needs to have a sense of what goes into a job description, how to orient and 
train new people, and how to handle the inevitable performance appraisal process. 
</p>
<p> Human resources departments expect and require library staff involvement, to 
some degree, in a number of key steps in the staffing process. Those steps are some 
variation of the following: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Needs determination/succession planning 
 &bull; Job design 
 &bull; Recruitment 
 &bull; Selection 
 &bull; Orientation and training 
 &bull; Evaluation 
 &bull; Coaching and discipline 
 &bull; Resignation and termination 
</p>
<p> Determining staffing needs is usually the responsibility of senior managers. Typi-
cally, staffing needs fall into one of two lists. The first is a wish list of positions that 
would be wonderful to have, if only funding were available; it is often a long list, and 
it is a special occasion when a new full-time employee (FTE) is finally funded. The 
second, and shorter, list covers expected vacancies&middot;retirements, promotions, and res-
ignations. It is up to the library to keep HR informed of expected vacancies. Knowing 
in advance what positions may become vacant and the timing may help HR do some 
combination recruiting for several units, which should stretch limited advertising dol-
lars and generate a stronger pool of candidates. 
</p>
<p> It almost goes without saying that the job design or description is the foundation 
for getting the best and brightest people. The U.S. Department of Labor suggests a 
process for developing job descriptions and deciding on the proper selection of instru-
ments such as appropriate paper or hands-on tests. The suggested process starts with the 
library&Ecirc;s organizational goals that a particular job is to assist in fulfilling. (Note: every 
staff member holds a separate position; however, several people may hold the same 
job&middot;for example, document delivery assistant.) Designing a job requires answering 
questions such as &bdquo;What activities are necessary to accomplish organizational goals?&permil; 
Answering this apparently simple question is usually more complex than one might ex-
pect. It requires detailed information in order to be useful. The goal is to be as compre-
hensive as possible in listing the tasks. Being too brief or too broad creates more work 
later in the process. For example, a task for a circulation service point position should 
be more than &bdquo;check out materials.&permil; The job description should cover all aspects of the 
work, such as checking the user&Ecirc;s borrowing status, providing answers to questions 
about item availability or items the person could not locate, and deactivating security 
tags. Such detail is essential for developing sound job descriptions as it helps you iden-
tify the necessary skills and knowledge to successfully perform the work. 
</p>
<p> Another step is establishing job success criteria (JCS), which are the keys to select-
ing the right person for the right position. This is also the most difficult and subjective 
of the steps in the model. While the goal of the process is simple to state&middot;&bdquo;What dis-
tinguishes successful from unsuccessful performance in the position?&permil;&middot;it is difficult 
to carry out. What constitutes success will vary from library to library and from time to 
time as the work changes. For example, being courteous to users is always important, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>42 3&mdash;Staffing
</p>
<p>but what if a person is courteous while providing incorrect information? What about a 
person who is great with users but is unwilling or unable to work well with other staff 
members? Thinking through the JSCs makes it much easier to select the right person for 
the position. JSCs allow you to develop the best questions to ask the candidates, those 
that most accurately reflect the skills and knowledge needed for success. 
</p>
<p> Job specifications (JS) are the skills, traits, knowledge, and experience that, when 
combined, results in successful performance. JSs are the requirements typically listed 
in job descriptions and advertisements, such as the educational background or degree 
required, years of experience, and a list of the specific skills sought. From a legal point 
of view, these items must be bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ). Merely 
saying they are will not satisfy a court, if you are challenged. You might have to be able 
to prove that they are the skills, knowledge, and experience a person ought to possess 
to succeed. For example, you might like to have someone with a high school diploma, 
but can you prove that it is essential to succeed in the work? If you can&Ecirc;t, don&Ecirc;t make it 
a requirement; make it something desirable. 
</p>
<p> Having completed the aforementioned steps, you can decide what instruments you 
should use to help decide which applicants to call in for an interview. Some instruments 
you likely know well&middot;application forms, names of references, and letters of interest. 
Others that are less common are various tests of basic required skills&middot;such as a certain 
level of error-free keyboarding. Library skills tests, such as alphabetizing or putting 
call numbers in order, are handled by the library. Whatever instruments you select, you 
must have a clear link back to the JSC and JS and in the event that you are challenged 
in court. 
</p>
<p> Recruitment 
</p>
<p> Once you develop the job description (JD), HR can commence the search for suit-
able applicants. Many large libraries conduct national searches for librarian and other 
professional positions while drawing on the local labor market for paraprofessional and 
clerical positions. Advertisements for openings ought to provide the basic job descrip-
tion information and indicate where and when a person should apply. 
</p>
<p> The search often begins as an internal process; that is, an announcement of a va-
cancy goes to the library&Ecirc;s staff. In some organizations, the policy is to interview any 
internal candidates before going outside. More often, the search is both internal and 
external&middot;with any internal applicants having the advantage of knowing more about 
the nature of the open position and being a known quantity to the employer (often, but 
not always, a good thing). In the United States, employers must place advertisements 
or recruit in places where persons in the protected categories (according to civil rights 
acts) are likely to see position announcements. 
</p>
<p> Selecting the Pool 
</p>
<p> Most recruiting efforts generate a larger pool of applicants than it is feasible to 
interview. Deciding whom to interview draws on information produced by the selec-
tion instruments you identified. The most common place to begin the sorting process 
is the application form and cover letter (when you apply for a position, keep this fact 
in mind; how carefully you prepare these documents often decides your chances of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Staffing Process 43
</p>
<p>getting interviewed). Some of the factors to look for are if the person has the required 
skills, how carefully materials are presented, and if the person supplies all the required 
information. A rough sorting of applicants just using basic issues such as those 
listed previously will usually reduce the pool by a substantial number. A further reduc-
tion, if necessary, can be done by asking how many of the desirable skills/abilities the 
applicant possesses. Having a final interview pool of three to six people is likely to pro-
duce a person to whom you would like to make an offer. Because the selection process 
involves a substantial amount of subjectivity, having developed sound JSCs and JSs will 
help keep the process as objective as possible. 
</p>
<p> Interviewing 
</p>
<p> The interview process will come into play when you are applying for a position and 
when you serve on a search committee. In both instances, it requires an understanding 
of the process and a good deal of practice to become an effective interviewee or inter-
viewer. What follows applies to both sides of the interview table. 
</p>
<p> A sound interview process has six important elements. First, there is the need to plan 
the process. Beyond the obvious&middot;such as timing and place&middot;some of the key planning 
issues are the length of the interview, whom to involve in the interview, the questions 
to ask, if there should be a tour, and how much time to devote to answering candidates&Ecirc; 
questions. As a candidate, you should also plan your questions about the position and 
institution. 
</p>
<p> The second element, and perhaps the most critical in a legal sense, is to carefully 
review the interview questions for their compliance with antidiscrimination laws; this 
is an area where HR staff can be of great assistance. Having consistency and compara-
bility of information about each candidate is also important. Maintaining consistency 
in the questions and the structure of the entire process for all the candidates is critical 
when it comes time to assess each one and make a final selection. Questions must be 
job related. If you can&Ecirc;t link each question to the job description, don&Ecirc;t ask it. Asking a 
few open-ended questions gives candidates an opportunity to respond more fully and 
demonstrate some of their skills. 
</p>
<p> Below are a few examples of legal open-ended questions that could apply to a va-
riety of vacant library positions: 
</p>
<p> &bull; What do you think your (current or former) supervisor would tell a friend 
about you? 
</p>
<p> &bull; What are some of the special skills you would bring to this job? 
 &bull; Tell me about who and what has motivated your work efforts in the past. 
 &bull; Have you performed the work entailed by this position before? If so, when? 
</p>
<p>Do you see any significant differences between then and now? 
 &bull; Give the candidate a real-life situation and ask how the person would handle 
</p>
<p>it. (The situation ought to relate to the work the person would be doing.) 
 &bull; What things do you like the most about your current position? What do you 
</p>
<p>like the least? 
 &bull; Tell me about one of your major accomplishments in your present position. 
 &bull; Tell me about the goals you set for yourself in terms of work. 
 &bull; What does the term &bdquo;service&permil; mean to you? </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44 3&mdash;Staffing
</p>
<p> &bull; What are some new work skills or knowledge that you believe would im-
prove your performance on the job? 
</p>
<p> &bull; What are your current career plans? Do you see them changing in the next 
three years? What do you envision for yourself over the long term? 
</p>
<p> The third element is having a segment of time when the candidate is given a clear 
sense of what he would actually do in the available position and an overview of the li-
brary&Ecirc;s operation and mission. Also, having some time to explain the relationship of the 
library to its parent body helps candidates make an informed decision should an offer be 
made. It is also the time for the candidate to ask the search committee questions. 
</p>
<p> A fourth element in the process is the personal impact of the candidate and the in-
terviewers on one another. Creating a relaxed and friendly atmosphere at the outset helps 
candidates become less nervous and thus more effective during the formal interview. 
Such things as tone of voice, eye contact, personal appearance and grooming, posture, 
and gestures on the part of candidate and interviewer influence both parties. Keep in 
mind, in a culturally diverse community, the meanings of these things may be very, very 
different. For example, lack of eye contact does not always mean a person is the &bdquo;shifty-
eyed character&permil; of English novels. 
</p>
<p> The fifth element, which is related to impact, is how the interviewer responds to 
the applicant. Interviewers must be careful to control any nonverbal behavior that may 
encourage or discourage the applicant in an inappropriate way. Not showing an inter-
est in what the candidate is saying will discourage the person from expanding on her 
thoughts, and this may well carry over to the remainder of the interview. Anyone with 
extensive interviewing experience understands just how difficult controlling those two 
behaviors can be at times. 
</p>
<p> The final element is to assess the interview data fairly and equitably for all the in-
terviewees. Following are some of the issues that can cause unfair processing: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Stereotyping the type of person that would be right for the position 
 &bull; Allowing different members of a search committee to use different weights 
</p>
<p>for various attributes 
 &bull; Overusing visual clues about the candidate that are not job related 
 &bull; Not recognizing &bdquo;contrast effects&permil;&middot;that is, when a strong candidate follows 
</p>
<p>a very weak candidate, the contrast makes the stronger applicant look even 
stronger than he may be. 
</p>
<p> Here are some suggestions to keep in mind when you are being interviewed: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Take some time to research the library and its parent organization ahead of 
time; their Web sites can tell you a great deal about them. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Generate a few questions about the library based on your research and your 
own interests. 
</p>
<p> &bull; If you did not receive a full position description, don&Ecirc;t be shy about asking for 
one; take time to think of questions about the position. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Spend some time thinking about the answers you might give to questions that 
are likely to be part of the interview (for example, what interests you about </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Staff Development, Training, and Retention 45
</p>
<p>this particular position? What do you consider your strengths and your weak-
nesses? What does the term &bdquo;service&permil; mean to you?). 
</p>
<p> &bull; Dress appropriately. 
 &bull; Be on time. 
 &bull; Be certain to have the name and its correct pronunciation for the chairperson 
</p>
<p>of the interview committee. 
 &bull; Remember that your body language also reflects your interest and at-
</p>
<p>tentiveness. 
 &bull; Taking time to think before answering complex questions is appropriate&middot;
</p>
<p>thinking before speaking is always a good idea. 
 &bull; When asked a multipart questions, be sure to cover all the parts; asking the 
</p>
<p>interviewer to clarify or repeat such questions is appropriate. 
 &bull; Asking how any personal or potentially illegal question(s) relate to job per-
</p>
<p>formance is appropriate; however, be sure to ask in a nonconfrontational 
manner. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Thank the interviewer(s) for the opportunity to interview for the position. 
 &bull; Asking about the anticipated time frame for the hiring decision is ap-
</p>
<p>propriate. 
 &bull; To learn from each interview experience, jot down a few post-interview notes 
</p>
<p>about some of the high and low points of the interview. 
 &bull; Even if you decide during the interview process that this is not the position 
</p>
<p>for you, send a follow-up thank-you note to the chair of the search commit-
tee, supervisor for the position, or head of HR (whichever is most appropri-
ate), thanking them for their time and for giving you an opportunity to meet 
with them 
</p>
<p> What should you do if you are asked inappropriate questions, and is this likely to 
happen? An article by Marilyn Gardner indicates that it happens more often than one 
would expect, especially with small and medium-sized organizations, in part because 
people are not aware they are doing anything wrong. In her article Gardner quotes John 
Petrella, an employment lawyer, &bdquo;It happens all the time. . . . It&Ecirc;s really easy for employ-
ers to get in trouble. It&Ecirc;s really easy to run afoul of the antidiscrimination laws.&permil; 16  The 
article goes on to address what to do if you are asked improper questions and offers dif-
ferent approaches to consider before you respond to such questions. First, ask yourself, 
and perhaps the interviewer, &bdquo;Is this question related to the position I&Ecirc;m applying for?&permil; 
Remember, the question could be appropriate if it is clearly job related. At the same 
time you might want to consider, &bdquo;Do I really want to work for an organization that asks 
such questions?&permil; You do have the choice of not answering the questions, knowing that it 
might mean you will not get an offer. You can, of course, answer the question and then 
inquire as to the relevance of the question to the position. There is a reasonable chance 
that you will have to deal with this issue at some point in your career, as an interviewee 
(try not to do it when you are the interviewer). 
</p>
<p> STAFF DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND RETENTION 
</p>
<p> Once a person has been selected and has accepted the position, the next step is to 
develop a plan for orienting her to the position and the library. Sometimes people forget </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>46 3&mdash;Staffing
</p>
<p>that the first few days on a job sets a pattern that can be either negative or positive. Those 
first few days are especially critical to the person&Ecirc;s fitting in and the person&Ecirc;s views 
about the library and its long-term training/development program. A well-thought-out 
orientation, including the training required for the position, will make it more likely that 
you will retain the person. Yet too often the first days focus only on the activities of the 
position. That is natural as in most cases the position has been vacant for a month or 
more and work has stacked up, but falling into this trap may result in a higher turnover 
than anyone would like. 
</p>
<p> Generally, the first week should be equally divided between position training and 
learning about the library and its parent organization. For most people, the first days 
on a new job are stressful and confusing. The common practice of taking the new em-
ployee around to meet everyone, assuming there are more than a dozen people to meet, 
leaves the new employee with a blur of faces, a few names (rarely connected to the right 
face), and a vague sense of what others do. Breaking the process up over several days 
gives the new person a better chance to absorb information and make meaningful con-
nections. Starting with the home unit and working out through units that feed into and 
receive output from the home unit allows the new employee to gain a sense of where 
her position fits in the scheme of things and how it is important to library operations. 
After that you can move on to other units to allow the person to gain an overall picture 
of operations. Linking a new employee to someone at his level in the work group (a 
mentor) provides a personal connection for clarification or for questions the new em-
ployee might be afraid to ask his supervisor, lest he be thought of as silly. It also helps 
the mentors by giving them recognition and the motivation to check over those points 
that the mentor may have been taking for granted. One institution with a well-thought-
out orientation program is the University of Washington (http://www.washington.edu/
admin/hr/pod/newemp/). 
</p>
<p> Retention 
</p>
<p> A major concern for organizations is retaining their best people. Nora Spinks of-
fered some interesting thoughts about how generational differences affect retention: &bdquo;If 
you were a child in the 50s (a Boomer), you saw that working hard was a strategy that 
led to success. Loyalty was rewarded with long-term employment through to retire-
ment. However, if you were a child in the 70s or 80s (a Nexus), you saw adults working 
hard and getting laid off, downsized or reengineered out of a job anyway. Employment 
tenure was out of your control, employers offered you a job as long as they felt you were 
of value, then let you go.&permil; 17  
</p>
<p> For many employers, their lack of loyalty to long-term staff is coming back to 
haunt them. &bdquo;Why should I have any loyalty to the organization if it has none for me?&permil; 
is a question in the minds of many workers. For many, all it takes is a hint of staffing 
changes&middot;real or imagined&middot;or something perceived to be a threat, and people start 
looking for other employment and in many cases actually leaving. They have experi-
enced or heard of organizations that announce staff reductions and say in effect to the 
staff, &bdquo;We don&Ecirc;t need you but fully expect you to give a 100 percent work effort until the 
day you are terminated.&permil; When that happens, the outcome is what you would expect&middot;
performance declines and people leave as quickly as possible. Although the pattern is </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Staff Development, Training, and Retention 47
</p>
<p>primarily seen in for-profit organizations, staff reductions in force are not unheard of 
in libraries. 
</p>
<p> Another retention factor that is gaining the attention of researchers is new-job re-
grets, which about 25 percent of newly hired people experience. 18  All too often the re-
grets arise from the employer overselling the nature of the position or some other aspect 
of the environment. If you properly followed the steps outlined earlier and the new hire 
had a copy of the job description before accepting the offer, there should be few prob-
lems related to the nature of the work. Where you may unknowingly oversell is when you 
really need to fill the position and fall into the trap of making the institution, opportuni-
ties, benefits, and so forth appear better than they actually are. In the long run, oversell-
ing or misrepresenting the position makes for very unhappy people &mdash; both the new hire 
and yourself. When the remorse is very strong, the probability that the person will quit 
is extremely high. 
</p>
<p> Training and Development 
</p>
<p> One key method for gaining and retaining staff loyalty, is to have programs that 
give ample opportunities for staff to grow and develop. Without a doubt this will help 
with the long-term retention of the best and brightest people. You have two basic train-
ing/development areas to consider&middot;specific job-related skills and career-development 
competencies and opportunities. 
</p>
<p> Libraries face a rapidly changing technological environment. Keeping staff current 
with the changes related to their activities is a major challenge, especially when budgets 
are static. It is also crystal clear that failing to maintain staff skills will result in users 
receiving poorer service, which in turn leads to user dissatisfaction. Technology carries 
with it two financial challenges&middot;acquiring and upgrading requisite technology and 
funding staff training. 
</p>
<p> Certainly training and development go beyond technological issues. Some of the 
other major areas include training for people moving into supervisory positions and 
training designed to keep staff up-to-date on changing professional standards. In techni-
cal services, staying current with standards is critical, and too often, limited travel funds 
for staff lead to long-term performance problems for the staff and the library. 
</p>
<p> Professional associations can and do provide excellent training opportunities. An-
nual conventions often have workshops and other continuing education programs. Un-
fortunately, there are very few such organizational opportunities for support staff; this 
seems to be changing, at least with the ALA, where the annual conference started a 
&bdquo;conference within a conference&permil; for support staff. (The primary reason for the lack of 
programs is that there is limited financial assistance for support staff travel. In addition, 
their salaries are substantially lower, making it difficult for many of them to pay for such 
opportunities on their own. Thus, groups such as COLT have difficulty attracting enough 
people to a workshop to make the effort worthwhile.) As more educational institutions 
and professional bodies extend the range of distance education programs, training op-
portunities are increasing for support staff&middot;particularly via &bdquo;Webinars&permil; and video con-
ferencing. Notable examples of these training opportunities are the SirsiDynix Institute&Ecirc;s 
(http://www.sirsidynixinstitute.com/) &bdquo;Soaring to Excellence&permil; series and the programs 
available through the Online Computer Library Center&Ecirc;s WebJunction (http://www. 
webjunction.org). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>48 3&mdash;Staffing
</p>
<p> In addition to concerns about funding, libraries face the problem of limited staffing, 
at least in most services. When staff is limited, it becomes difficult to have employees 
away at training programs for any length of time. Some jurisdictions are so shortsighted 
that they refuse to give time off to attend training programs even when the staff member 
is willing to pay for the program&middot;shortsighted because in time the staff member&Ecirc;s ser-
vices will become less and less effective if training is not kept current . 
</p>
<p> Singer and Goodrich outlined five critical factors for retaining and motivating li-
brary staff. 19  These are principles for a supervisor to exemplify and to help employees 
perform as well. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Focus: employees know what they need to do and what is expected of 
them 
</p>
<p> &bull; Involvement: people support most what they help create 
 &bull; Development: opportunities for learning and growth are encouraged 
 &bull; Gratitude: good performance is recognized (formally and informally) 
 &bull; Accountability: employees are responsible for their performance or lack 
</p>
<p>thereof 
</p>
<p> PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL 
</p>
<p> Singer and Goodrich&Ecirc;s last point regarding accountability directly links to perfor-
mance appraisal. Performance assessment takes two forms&middot;ongoing daily review with 
occasional corrective action and an annual overall assessment. 
</p>
<p> In terms of corrective action, an employee&Ecirc;s poor performance should be discussed 
as situations arise. Trying to avoid unpleasant interactions regarding performance and 
letting problems slide only hurts everyone in the long run. Being told that something 
was or is amiss during the annual performance review, when it is too late to take correc-
tive action, causes anger, frustration, and poorer performance down the road. Further-
more, other employees will notice the lack of any corrective action, and they are likely 
to conclude that supervisors don&Ecirc;t really care about quality performance. When that 
happens, they are likely to let their work performance slide. By the time that happens, 
the situation is highly complex situation and will be difficult to resolve. Finally, service 
to users also suffers, and that in turn can lead to a serious lack of user support. 
</p>
<p> Following certain steps when corrective action is needed can help make the process 
as effective as possible. Start by stating the purpose of the session; even if the situation 
has the potential for confrontation, speak calmly. Plan on letting the employee talk as 
much as possible.  Listening  is the key to having a successful session. Too often, there 
is a tendency to start planning one&Ecirc;s response rather than listening and trying to  hear  
what the person is saying. Silence, even a long one, serves a good purpose&middot;it lets both 
parties think about what is taking place. Setting a time limit for the session can defeat 
the purpose of the session; it may take time to get to the central issue(s). Expect the 
employee to be unhappy, upset, and probably argumentative, and there is the possibility 
that she may engage in a personal verbal attack on you. It is important, if difficult, not 
to take the attack very personally; above all, do  not  respond in kind. Total resolution is </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Performance Appraisal 49
</p>
<p>not the only indication of a successful session. Sometimes it takes a series of sessions to 
reach a complete resolution. Try to end the session on a positive note and, if appropriate, 
schedule a follow-up session. 
</p>
<p> The goal is to be as consistent as possible in your evaluations. Standards should 
not shift from one week to the next or, worse yet, vary from one employee to another. 
Remember you should be evaluating outcomes rather than the process (as long as the 
process does not cause trouble or problems for others). You shouldn&Ecirc;t hold a new em-
ployee as closely accountable for an error as an older, more experienced person. This 
does  not  mean that you ignore the newcomer&Ecirc;s problem. Naturally, a person lacking the 
skill to do a task needs additional training rather than criticism. If the training does not 
work, then other adjustments will be necessary, including the difficult but occasionally 
necessary step of termination. 
</p>
<p> Something to consider before taking corrective steps is to think about personal 
biases that might color your judgment of people and their performance. When it is clear 
something should be done, think about the timing of the next appraisal (keeping in mind 
any and all personal biases), and then begin the counseling process. Keep in mind this 
may require further serious steps, especially if a person has had a negative review for 
two years in succession. It is always wise to work collaboratively with HR in these 
situations. 
</p>
<p> Annual performance reviews are something that most people endure and almost 
never look forward to, much less enjoy. Neither the givers nor the recipients have 
great faith in the process or that much good will come out of what many view as an 
ordeal. 
</p>
<p> Probably the biggest challenge, and where the difficulty lies, is in the dual nature 
of the review process. Although most HR departments attempt to keep it to a single 
purpose, performance enhancement, the reality is that there is sometimes an unofficial 
but real link to salary increases. The dual purpose is well documented, but most clearly 
articulated by Saul Gellerman. 20  The single process attempts to handle behavioral issues 
(work performance) and administrative issues (compensation and occasional promo-
tions). The two purposes are almost diametrically opposed in character. To be effective 
in improving performance, the process should be open and candid. From an administra-
tive perspective the process should be closed and secretive. Trying to accomplish both 
in a single process is a challenge to say the least. Almost every employee believes the 
salary aspect is the dominant factor. 
</p>
<p> If you give constant honest feedback throughout the year&middot;both praise and correc-
tion&middot;the annual review will be as painless and stress free as possible. There is no way 
to remove the salary component, however, as long as the parent organization, directly or 
indirectly, uses reviews as part of its salary deliberations/considerations. 
</p>
<p> In spite of your best efforts, there will be times when disciplinary action must take 
place. Needless to say, such action should only follow after a number of counseling ses-
sions have failed to resolve the issue. In the United States, HR units label the process 
&bdquo;progressive discipline.&permil; The process consists of a series of steps that become progres-
sively more severe and can end with termination. Most of the time, the process never 
reaches the termination stage as the parties resolve the issue earlier. The sooner you 
address performance issues, the less likely it is you will have to go through the stress of 
a formal grievance procedure. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>50 3&mdash;Staffing
</p>
<p> PART-TIME STAFF 
</p>
<p> The literature tends to pay little attention to part-time staff. This is unfortunate as 
the work of part-timers is often critical to quality public service&middot;just think about those 
who reshelve collections materials, or handle physical processing of materials duties 
for the collections, most of whom are part-time people, and the impact of those tasks 
on quality of service. 
</p>
<p> Although you will encounter part-time people in almost any job category, two 
part-time groups are very common in libraries&middot;student assistants and volunteers. 
These two groups, especially students in educational library settings, may come close 
to the equivalent of full-time staff in terms of hours worked. (A 2005 survey by the 
Association of Research Libraries noted that the average number of student work-
ers exceed, by a slight margin, the average number of full-time personnel in public 
services. See Association of Research Libraries,  ARL Statistics Interaction Edition , 
http://www.fisher.lib.virginia.edu/arl.) For many libraries, quality service would not 
be possible without the aid of part-time students and volunteers. The work such in-
dividuals perform should receive the same attention and thought given to full-time 
positions. 
</p>
<p> Students 
</p>
<p> Almost all libraries associated with educational institutions make extensive use 
of student labor. No matter what type of library&middot;college, school, or university&middot;the 
students have, or should have, the proper handling of their studies as their primary ob-
jective. Working in the library, even for pay, is much lower priority and the fact must be 
kept in mind when using student labor. Many public libraries also use students for posi-
tions such as pages or stack maintenance personnel. In technical services, they perform 
a variety of duties that are necessary but not challenging for a person to do full-time. At 
public libraries, unlike at academic institutions, part-time student workers are viewed 
as any other part-time staff members, except that perhaps they are given a little slack in 
scheduling during exam periods. 
</p>
<p> The early literature about using students as employees gives the impression that 
student workers are too much trouble and not worth the effort. The focus then was on 
the limitations and problems of employing students. Such an emphasis may have been 
necessary to work out the issues, but part of the problem likely did and can lie in not 
spending enough time on preplanning and developing true job descriptions for what the 
students will do. In any event, what is clear is that educational libraries are very depen-
dent on such labor. 
</p>
<p> Beyond the obvious benefit of having valuable work accomplished at a modest 
cost, students bring several benefits to the library. One benefit is that as peers/class-
mates, they are often viewed as more approachable than the full-time staff. This is espe-
cially true when the student body&Ecirc;s cultural composition and that of the full-time staff 
is markedly different. Student employees are much more likely to have a sound idea 
of what technologies students use and how and when they use the technologies. Such 
information can be of great value when planning a new service or a different approach 
to an old one. Yet another benefit is that students can help full-time staff understand 
where the students are coming from&middot;they relate more effectively to the primary ser-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Part-Time Staff 51
</p>
<p>vice population. Finally, they are the pool from which to recruit individuals to librar-
ianship. 
</p>
<p> Certainly, you need to recognize the generational differences regarding work ex-
pectations and the workplace when adding students to the staffing mix. There are only 
a few &bdquo;traditionalists&permil; (those born before 1945) still working in libraries, and most are 
working as volunteers rather than as paid staff. The traditionalists worked in highly 
structured workplaces for almost all their careers and are comfortable with a hierarchi-
cal system. They believe in hard work, commitment, and loyalty. 
</p>
<p> Baby boomers (those born 1946&ndash;1964) are the largest generation in the workplace 
and in the population. They are now mostly in the senior positions in libraries. When 
they entered the workforce, there was great competition for available jobs; further, they 
faced a highly competitive work environment for much of their careers. Generally, they 
are less inclined to teamwork in the sense of the term today. They were also the first 
generation to experience significant layoffs, which often reinforced their need to be 
competitive and independent. 
</p>
<p> Generation X ( those born 1965&ndash;1980) is a much smaller cohort. These are the 
people who will begin to fill the senior positions in libraries as baby boomers retire&middot;a 
process that is now under way. They grew up pretty much on their own&middot; latchkey chil-
dren with two working parents or in a single-parent home. Generally, they are very inde-
pendent and have strong doubts about authority and loyalty. Often they value their free 
time more highly than doing extra work to earn more money, even when that work might 
lead to a promotion. They are much more comfortable with self-managed teams than are 
the baby boomers. 
</p>
<p> Millennials (those born 1981 &ndash; 1999), the most recent group to enter the workforce, 
are even fewer in number than Generation X. This generation will not face strong com-
petition for positions given their small numbers; in fact, it is likely the employers will 
be the ones competing for employees. Millennials were the first generation to grow up 
in a technology-filled world&middot;technology was not new; it was just the way the world 
was. Technology is something they are comfortable with; they expect it to work prop-
erly and on demand. Their expectation of a quick response often carries over into their 
workplace expectations. Employers are finding that millennial-generation employees 
have little patience when it comes to waiting for promotions and are quick to leave 
organizations. Teams have been a natural part of their growing up in school and in 
highly structured group activities such as sports, so work teams do not seem unnatural 
to them.

<p> When there is a mix of generations in the workplace, as in most libraries, there are 
motivation challenges to address. Large numbers of student workers adds to the com-
plexity. Supervisors will probably need to use different approaches with students than 
with the older full-time staff. 
</p>
<p> Just as you want to retain full-time staff, you also want to retain student workers for 
as long as possible. There is the obvious built-in student turnover as they graduate; how-
ever, keeping the best workers for as long as possible lowers training costs and some 
supervision costs. One step to take, even if it is not well implemented with the full-time 
staff, is to create student work teams. As noted, millennials are team oriented and need 
little assistance fitting into team duties and responsibilities. Consider building teams 
around a set of duties rather than scheduled work times. In the past, a duties approach 
was difficult at best and often impossible. With texting, cell phones, e-mail, and the like, </p>

</p>
<p>students are in touch all the time making it easier to implement a duties system. A team 
that seldom has more than one member on duty at any time can still be very effective in 
a technological environment. 
</p>
<p> Teams need leaders, and this provides opportunities for promotion and rewards. 
With multiple work schedules, there may also be opportunities for assistant leaders. 
Such a structure may also allow you to create a student career ladder with appropriate 
pay differentials. 
</p>
<p> Regardless of how you structure the work, students should be held just as account-
able for the quality of their work as full-time staff. (This also applies to volunteer work-
ers.) Having different standards of accountability can and probably will lead to major 
morale problems and low-quality overall performance for the library. 
</p>
<p> Sound mentoring is effective in recruiting people to librarianship. Students tend to 
be open to mentoring when it focuses on issues they perceive as relevant. If for noth-
ing more than helping them to learn appropriate work behavior and dress, this is useful 
activity. This section has touched on only a few of the benefits of using student work-
ers. We highly recommend you spend some time reviewing Kimberly B. Sweetman&Ecirc;s 
 Managing Student Assistants.  21  Although its primary focus is on academic libraries, it 
has much to offer anyone thinking about or using student employees. 
</p>
<p> Volunteers 
</p>
<p> Library volunteers play a growing role in daily operations. They are likely to be-
come even more common as more and more of the baby boomer generation retires. 
Many small libraries (rural, school, and church) are totally dependent on volunteers, 
with perhaps a retired person with library experience taking a lead role. Other libraries 
may be less dependent on volunteer assistance, but still use such services for important 
tasks. 
</p>
<p> During the late 1990s, there was a major effort to increase volunteerism in the United 
States. Although there is less government emphasis now, volunteer service hours grow 
steadily. 
</p>
<p> No matter what values you place on the work, as of 2009, many granting agencies 
currently allow libraries to use an $18.21 per hour rate for valuing volunteer service, 
and the annual contribution is in the billions of dollars. While volunteer work is increas-
ing, there is concern about being able to retain volunteers. Daniel Kadlec reported that 
&bdquo;Nearly 38 million Americans who had volunteered in a nonprofit in the past didn&Ecirc;t 
show up last year [2005] . . . That is a waste of talent and desire.&permil; 22  Organizations cannot 
waste such potential people power. As baby boomers retire, they take with them a vast 
amount of experience and, perhaps more importantly, institutional memory that is very 
valuable. The professional literature frequently has stories about library staff members 
retiring and then returning as volunteers. Losing such people because the volunteer 
activities have not been properly planned would be very sad. 
</p>
<p> There is a vast pool of talented energetic, and motivated volunteers to tap into and, 
one hopes, retain. Volunteers can become highly committed to a library&Ecirc;s organizational 
goals, given the proper environment, even if they have never worked in a library. Part 
of that environment is thinking about volunteers as being just as important to quality 
service as any paid staff member. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Part-Time Staff 53
</p>
<p> Begin your thinking and planning for volunteers by considering a few basic 
questions: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Should we use volunteers? (A very key question to ponder) 
 &bull; Where could we use volunteers? 
 &bull; How would we use them? 
 &bull; Would the tasks be meaningful for volunteers? 
 &bull; Who would supervise the volunteers? 
 &bull; Would we have one person in charge of the overall program? 
 &bull; Do we have or can we create meaningful volunteer rewards? 
</p>
<p> Dale Freund explored the question of whether volunteers should be used in librar-
ies. 23  He believed that when done properly and for the right reasons, the answer is yes. 
Success hinges on your thinking through questions such as the aforementioned and 
creating a plan. 
</p>
<p> There are three major volunteer categories to think about in the United States. One 
is the short-term volunteer. These are the people who will work on special projects or 
events but have no interest in a regular commitment, such as coming in one day per 
week for a few hours. Some library examples are an annual book sale, disaster recovery 
efforts, or a capital fund-raising campaign. A second category is the commitment volun-
teer. These are people who have a strong interest in the area in which they seek volunteer 
opportunities. They expect to gain gratification, knowledge, and useful skills as well as 
a sense of accomplishment from the work they perform. For most libraries, these are the 
people who form the backbone of a successful long-term volunteer program. They are 
also the group that requires the most careful planning and needs the most meaningful 
work to perform. 
</p>
<p> Finally, there are volunteers who engage in the activity because of some outside 
pressure rather than any personal desire. You may be able to transform some of these 
people into committed volunteers, but only through careful planning. Two significant 
sources of outside pressure are the workplace and school. Many for-profit organiza-
tions, while not making volunteering mandatory, make it very clear that they expect 
employees to engage in some form of volunteer work. Such organizations normally 
have a very broad definition of what constitutes volunteer work and how that activity 
counts in the performance review process. A few colleges and universities have gone 
so far as to make volunteer work a graduation requirement. Most don&Ecirc;t go that far, but 
they do encourage students to volunteer, often through such means as adding it to the 
student&Ecirc;s transcript, offering credit for the approved activities. These approaches have 
been rather successful; for example, in 2005, more than 3.3 million college students 
engaged in service to some nonprofit organization and averaged just under 100 hours 
per student. 24  
</p>
<p> Where do you begin your search for volunteers? Your recruiting efforts will not 
take place in the same venues as for paid staff. There are five major places to explore; 
each requires a somewhat different approach to the message and where to place that 
message: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Retirees 
 &bull; Students </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>54 3&mdash;Staffing
</p>
<p> &bull; Homemakers 
 &bull; Employed people 
 &bull; Unemployed people (most hope to gain a marketable skill or perhaps se-
</p>
<p>cure a paid position with the organization) 
</p>
<p> Reaching out to students, the employed, and the unemployed is relatively easy as 
there are organizations that will help get your message out. Retirees are a little more 
challenging; however, senior centers and other locations that offer senior programs 
are a good starting point. Homemakers are the biggest challenge; in this case school 
libraries have an inside track on getting great volunteers. 
</p>
<p> The best way to develop a cadre of committed volunteers is to start with job de-
scriptions, using the same method as for paid staff positions. Doing this provides a solid 
base for everyone about the whats and hows of the positions. Surprises such as &bdquo;I don&Ecirc;t 
want to make photocopies&permil; are much less likely when the person had an opportunity to 
review a JD indicating photocopying was part of the job. As with paid positions, the JD 
should outline duties and experience/skills sought. (Note: after preparing the descrip-
tions it is wise to consult the HR department to explore any issues such as injury or 
liability coverage for volunteers.) 
</p>
<p> When it comes to volunteers, there is rarely a pool of applicants to interview&middot;you 
are happy to have someone interested in the position. That notwithstanding, the inter-
view is just as important for volunteers as it is for paid staff. This is the opportunity for 
both parties to assess skills, motivation, and the nature of the work. 
</p>
<p> Generally, volunteers require more initial training and development than paid staff. 
This is particularly true when the volunteer has retired from a somewhat similar paid 
position&middot;for example, a retired school librarian volunteering in an archive. Volunteers 
often need time to unlearn years of past practices and/or modify beliefs about how 
things should be done. Too often the supervisor&Ecirc;s assumption is that such people have 
done this before and therefore need very little training. It may be a while before it be-
comes apparent that this was a poor assumption and work must be redone. 
</p>
<p> There is no doubt that volunteers provide wonderful assistance to thousands of 
libraries, however, there are a few areas in which tension can arise between volunteers 
and paid staff. 25  One obvious area is a fear or concern about job security, especially 
where funding is tight or hiring freezes are in place. Paid staff may harbor unstated wor-
ries that their jobs may be in jeopardy, especially if some of the volunteers have prior 
library experience. We are unaware of any documented case where paid staff lost their 
jobs because of the availability of volunteers. However, we do know of instances where 
layoffs took place because of funding problems and sometime later the organization 
restarted a service based on volunteer help. When starting a volunteer program, you 
should address this concern openly and honestly with the paid staff. 
</p>
<p> Another challenge is when volunteers and paid staff perform the same tasks, which 
is something to avoid whenever possible. When it does happen, performance assess-
ment becomes a significant issue. There may be strong resentment of the volunteers&Ecirc; 
apparent freedom to come and go with little or no notice and the appearance that they 
are held to a lower work standard. Paid staff may also think the volunteers are receiving 
encouragement or praise for work they believe is less than standard, or at least a lower 
standard than they are expected to deliver. Your managerial creativity and ingenuity </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Notes 55
</p>
<p>will face great challenges when you try to provide that extra level of encouragement to 
volunteers and retain their services, while not undermining staff morale. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> Many years ago John D. Rockefeller is supposed to have said, &bdquo;I will pay more for 
the ability to deal with people than any other ability under the sun.&permil; Whether he said that 
or not, the sentiment is the key to having quality library services: hire top-notch people 
and retain their services and loyalty. To be able to do that you need to follow sound 
people-planning practices and thoughtfully design their work activities. 
</p>
<p> It may not seem likely right now that you will need much of the information in this 
chapter; however, we anticipate that paraprofessionals will play an ever-growing role in 
quality library services. Those roles will call for greater involvement in personnel mat-
ters, from how to select the right person, to how to supervise and motivate team mem-
bers, whether they are full time, part time or volunteers.

<p>4  Technical Services Issues 
</p>
<p> The economic benefit of consortia lies in the ability of libraries to take their 
budgets further, spending less and getting more. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Catherine Maskell, 2008 
</p>
<p> A critical underlying perspective is the expected outcome of the assessment 
process: evaluation for accountability or for continuous improvement. . . . The 
strategies undertaken to demonstrate accountability fall along a continuum of 
&bdquo;we do it because we have to&permil; to &bdquo;we do it because it is a tool in helping the 
institution review, evaluate, and improve efficiency and effectiveness.&permil; 
</p>
<p> &middot;Robert Dugan, 2006 
</p>
<p> There have always been challenges and issues facing technical services, just as there 
have for other library units. However, in the current environment, new challenges seem 
to appear just as soon as you think you&Ecirc;ve addressed one or more of them. Some of the 
issues we cover in this chapter are long-standing while others are of more recent origin. 
Certainly, the most critical issue facing every person and organization as we prepared this 
book is the serious downturn in the world economy&middot;with the U.S. leading the way. That 
overarching issue has and will continue to have an impact on all aspects of the issues we 
cover in this chapter: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Technology 
 &bull; Outsourcing 
 &bull; Cooperative/consortial activities 
 &bull; Quality assurance (assessment and accountability) 
 &bull; Fiscal/budgetary 
 &bull; Physical work space </p>

<p>60 4&mdash;Technical Services Issues
</p>
<p> TECHNOLOGY 
</p>
<p> Many people are unaware that it was cataloging that originally brought computers 
and networking into libraries on a large scale many years ago. The Integrated Library 
System (ILS; computer systems and programs that link library operations in an almost 
seamless manner) grew out of libraries&Ecirc; efforts to provide cost-effective handling of 
acquisitions, cataloging, and other technical services activities. Few people who began 
their careers in technical services at that time ever dreamed that these efforts would lead 
to the current library technology. Today&Ecirc;s systems handle all of the traditional technical 
services functions and so much more. Technology has accelerated the performance of 
activities and improved consistency throughout the library; perhaps the area where this 
is most evident is technical services. You can see the impact of technology in almost 
all libraries. In terms of technical services, the Loyola Marymount University (LMU) 
library is probably a representative example of how technology affected technical ser-
vices activities. 
</p>
<p> In 1987, the LMU library had four OCLC terminals in the cataloging department 
and no other computers. The acquisitions budget at that time was just under $400,000, 
and the library cataloged and processed between 3,500 and 4,000 items per year. By 
1990, an ILS was in place and computers or terminals were available on about two-
thirds of the staff desks. As of 2008/2009, the acquisitions budget was more than 
$3.6 million, and processing exceeded 20,000 items. Although the dollar amount and 
production output grew during this time period, what is impressive is that the staffing ac-
tually  declined  by one full-time equivalent (FTE). This result was made possible only by 
taking advantage of advances in technology, primarily the capabilities of the ILS. 
</p>
<p> Productivity gains from an ILS come about in several ways. One of the most sig-
nificant arises from the ability to share files at the desktop level throughout the library. 
One of the great challenges for architects designing a new library facility in pre-ILS 
days was that almost every staff member wanted to be adjacent to the public card cata-
log in order to make the workday easier. Exacerbating those demands was the fact that 
the end-users had to have access to the catalog as well. Obviously, satisfying all of the 
wishes was impossible. The Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC), a key element in 
an ILS, allows remote access from almost anywhere and often on a 24/7 basis for any-
one with a network connection. (Statewide networks such as OhioLINK and California&Ecirc;s 
LINK+ further enhance the quality of service to end-users and provide real-time infor-
mation to technical services staff about collections in other libraries. We will explore in 
more depth later in this chapter.) 
</p>
<p> Sharing files electronically reduces staff time spent walking to and from their desks 
to shared paper-based files. Some of the shared files for technical services, both in 
the past and present, include on order, in processing, serials check-in, shelflist, and of 
course, the public catalog. Both technical and public services staff require access to in-
formation contained in such files from time to time; in pre-ILS times, staff walked for a 
good part of their workday. Also, some of these files contained basically the same infor-
mation, but were arranged differently. Creating and maintaining the files also required 
substantial staff time, especially when there were hundreds, and often in large libraries, 
thousands of slips of paper. (A traditional format in U.S. libraries was, and still is to 
some degree, a 3- &times; 5-inch [approximately 8- &times; 13-cm] card or paper slip.) Maintaining </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Technology 61
</p>
<p>paper-based files was a challenge for every technical services unit. Misfiled slips were a 
constant issue and could cost the library money. For example, if a book was already on 
order but the order slip was in an incorrect location, a second unneeded copy might be 
ordered because of the filing error. 
</p>
<p> An ILS generally provides keyword searching of a variety of fields in the electronic 
bibliographic record. (Information about fields and bibliographic records is in chap-
ters 13, 14, and 15.) Keyword searches provide a more complete view of collection 
content than does a traditional subject search based on a set of standardized subject 
headings. This is because a keyword search scans multiple fields, such as title, subtitle, 
and notes, not just the subject heading field. Libraries have found, after installing their 
first ILS, that users comment that they are surprised at how much more they find when 
using keyword searches. 
</p>
<p> Many ILS systems offer staff members and end-users the opportunity to browse 
the collection electronically. That is, a person can view all the bibliographic records in 
the database regardless of the item&Ecirc;s status&middot;on order, in process, checked out, missing, 
and at the bindery, for example. 
</p>
<p> One of the attractions of journals and newspapers for readers is the currency of the 
information. A frequent user question is, &bdquo;Has the latest issue of XX arrived yet?&permil; In 
pre-ILS days, such queries required a telephone call or a trip to the serials check-in file, 
usually located in technical services, to provide the answer. Most ILSs automatically 
display data on the latest issue processed through the OPAC. Even on-order information 
is often available to end-users in some systems, which is particularly useful in academic 
institutions where faculty requests are key to building the collections and faculty want 
to know the status of their requests. 
</p>
<p> Another reason for increased productivity is that a single electronic record can 
serve many purposes. With paper-based systems, technical services staff often had to 
re-create the same information in a slightly different arrangement or attempt to use 
multiple carbon-copy forms and then arrange the copies in the desired order. Anyone 
who has worked with multiple-copy order forms can recall how faint the images are on 
the fourth, fifth, or sixth copy. Not having to re-create records and having the computer 
rearrange information has freed up a considerable amount of staff time. There is also 
greater consistency and accuracy in the files, assuming that the original data entry was 
correct. 
</p>
<p> Overall, the ILS has given libraries a strong incentive to review what, how, and who 
does what. Technical services units have taken advantage of the opportunities and made 
numerous adjustments in their workflows and staffing patterns (see chapter 2 and chap-
ter 3). There is every reason to believe that the ILS will continue to evolve and provide 
further opportunities for improvements in productivity. 
</p>
<p> The opening paragraph to this chapter mentioned how just when you think you&Ecirc;ve 
resolved one challenge, things change. Providing end-users with ever-greater access to 
useful information through such features as keyword searching and 24/7 remote access 
to the OPAC and other databases seemed like good solutions&middot;and they were&middot;but tech-
nology keeps changing. We now know more adjustments are necessary if we are to 
effectively serve our various stakeholders. Beth Camden wrote, &bdquo;Once considered the 
crowning jewel of libraries the integrated library system (ILS) has lost its luster as our 
users have moved to Web search engines as their primary research tools.&permil; 1  In a follow-
up article, Carlen Ruschoff discussed some of the factors that will force significant </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>62 4&mdash;Technical Services Issues
</p>
<p>changes on the next generation ILS. She noted that the Web search engines, &bdquo;developed 
 outside  of the ILS, created a &Acirc;discovery layer&Ecirc; that is able to search across databases and 
files of information. Essentially what happened is that one very important feature has 
been removed from the ILS.&permil; 2  Her comments about how designers must think about a 
new ILS reflect the fact challenges are never over: 
</p>
<p> As we begin conceptualizing the ILS of tomorrow, we have to be very con-
scious of the work we will be doing five or more years from now, as well as 
the work we will  not  be doing. We need to be bold enough to re-examine the 
ways in which we do our work now, and imagine how it might be done dif-
ferently. 3  
</p>
<p> That next generation ILS is highly unlikely to be less expensive than the current 
systems, which are not cheap. Finding the necessary funding to acquire such systems 
will be a major challenge unless there is a quick turnaround in the economy. 
</p>
<p> Certainly the impact of technology now goes far beyond the ILS. The Internet and 
Web 2.0 applications have had a substantial impact on library activities. Vendors, es-
pecially those handling books or journals, are providing more of their services through 
the Web. Following are two examples of ways in which vendor Web services influence 
technical services. First, importing OCLC or Library of Congress bibliographic data has 
been a staple activity in libraries for many years. What has changed and is changing is 
that it is becoming easier to download files from vendors into the ILS and then modify 
the files to meet local needs. In the not-too-distant past, the best one could expect was to 
make modifications of files in the bibliographic utilities&Ecirc; or vendor&Ecirc;s database and then 
import the file. The supplier also determined the amount of modification or manipula-
tion that could be made. In general, they allowed limited modification. Another change 
is the ability to order materials and pay invoices electronically, which makes for faster 
service and, assuming the electronic data are correct, fewer errors. 
</p>
<p> An important element in the area of electronic influences is  metadata  (see chap-
ter 19), which is the generic term for cataloging and indexing for electronic documents. 
Web sites are a mixed bag of information ranging from the worthless, or even danger-
ous, to the authoritative. Libraries have been engaging in electronic collection develop-
ment of Web resources for a number of years by attempting to sort out the good from 
the bad and the ugly. The idea is to identify worthwhile and reliable electronic resource 
sites and provide end-users with access to those sites. A serious issue for libraries is 
how to go about describing such locations in the library&Ecirc;s OPAC or on its Web page. 
Metadata (information about information) is a term used to identify this concern. The 
Dublin Core (http://www.dublincore.org) is an example of an effort to reach agreement 
on a standardized method for describing Internet/Web resources. Another such effort 
began in July 2000, when OCLC and hundreds of cooperating libraries launched the 
Cooperative Online Resource Catalog (CORC) project, a service that allowed libraries 
around the world to retrieve and describe outstanding Internet resources. This program 
was incorporated into OCLC  Connexion  service in 2002 (Archived Projects, OCLC, 
http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/archive/default.htm). 
</p>
<p> Libraries are using technology to empower their users to shop for services. Li-
braries are using the Internet and their Web sites as a major part of their information-
delivery systems. Library Web sites have gone from simply linking to their OPAC to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Technology 63
</p>
<p>offering online reference services, blogs, RSS feeds, wikis, meeting room reservations, 
digital newsletters, subject guides to information, and links to various commercial and 
in-house databases, among other things. 
</p>
<p> Michael Stephens lists some of the uses libraries are making of Web 2.0 social 
software tools &bdquo;in creating conversations, connections, and community&permil;: 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Openness.  Libraries use weblogs to generate dialogue and tell the human 
story of the library. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Ease of use.  Libraries use instant messaging to perform virtual reference in-
stead of hard-to-use proprietary platforms. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Innovation.  Libraries create subject-based wikis where users can suggest re-
sources and ask questions. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Social interaction.  Comment-enabled weblogs allow users to get involved 
with library planning and programs. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Creation of content.  A library offers space and digital tools to create audio 
and video presentations, stories and more. (See the Public Library of Char-
lotte and Mecklenburg County&Ecirc;s &bdquo;ImaginOn&permil; program for a good example: 
http://www.imaginon.org/index.asp). 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Sharing.  A library feeds RSS content from various sources to other Web 
pages within the local community. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Decentralization.  A librarian creates a Google Maps mash-up of the routes of 
library delivery vehicles. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Participation.  The library begins a wiki for its strategic plans, inviting all staff 
and users to participate in a vision for the future. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Trust.  Librarians release control of their data and utilize radical trust with 
their users and each other. Staff members blog freely and informally. 4  
</p>
<p> Allowing users into library resources that were formerly the exclusive domain of 
library staff is not without controversy. Some argue that there is a danger of depro-
fessionalizing libraries by allowing too much creative participation by users. Web 2.0 
technology is most effective if viewed as supplementing, not replacing, traditional li-
brary expertise. For example, allowing users to tag entries in the OPAC with their own 
descriptors, comments, reviews, and ratings does not replace the cataloging expertise 
required to assign controlled vocabulary subject headings. Tagging does, however, 
offer an additional means for customers to discover the contents of libraries&Ecirc; OPACs 
and improves their utility. (For an example of tagging in action, see the University of 
Pennsylvania&Ecirc;s PennTags at http://tags.library.upenn.edu/.) Using Web 2.0 tools is a 
customer-centered paradigm that seeks to reduce barriers to information, increase li-
brary knowledge of customer wants and needs, and improve customer satisfaction with 
library services and resources. 
</p>
<p> Providing access to Web 2.0 productivity tools (for example, Google Docs and 
Spreadsheets) has a dual advantage for libraries, especially small libraries. Online pro-
ductivity software allows library users to write resumes, create newsletters, share docu-
ments, and do other tasks usually performed by Microsoft Office or Apple suites. The 
online software allows them to create, store, access, and share their documents online 
for free, anywhere they can access a network connection. Empowering people to cus-
tomize their own Web-based services in this way can be an important step to lessening </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>64 4&mdash;Technical Services Issues
</p>
<p>the technology gap between the haves and the have-nots and will certainly create a 
loyal base of library supporters who utilize these services. Offering online productivity 
software is also an advantage for the library. It can be expensive to keep up with new 
versions of commercial office productivity software (e.g., Microsoft and Apple), both 
the software and hardware requirements, and providing access to, and training in, the 
alternative free software can allow the library to provide user services they could not 
otherwise afford. 5  
</p>
<p> OUTSOURCING 
</p>
<p>  Outsourcing  means having some service or activity performed by persons or orga-
nizations (called &bdquo;third parties&permil;) that are not part of a library or library system. When 
looking at the professional literature of the past 10 years for discussions about the con-
cept, a newcomer to the field might think outsourcing is a new phenomenon in libraries. 
That impression is only partially correct. Technical services units have been outsourcing 
activities for a great many years: using jobbers for ordering books rather than purchas-
ing directly from the publisher; using serial vendors to place the bulk of subscriptions 
rather than going directly to the publishers; and using outside companies to bind and 
repair materials for the collection. (We will examine the foregoing topics in the chapters 
that follow.) Somewhat new are efforts to use outside agencies for other activities and 
even overall library operations. In the case of overall operations, U.S. government agen-
cies have used such services for their library programs for many years, as have some 
corporations. What is happening late in the first decade of the 21st century is serious 
reductions in service locations and even closing of some public and special libraries as 
economic conditions worsen. As a result, if funding bodies are looking to reduce costs 
they are not looking to outsource activities but rather to cut or close down the activity. 
</p>
<p> Recent emphasis on outsourcing started in the for-profit sector in the 1980s and 
1990s&middot;at the same time topics such as reengineering and downsizing were popular. 
Like libraries, businesses had employed the concept for many years without media at-
tention. The difference in coverage was that the idea was often linked with staff reduc-
tions. Another term that came into play at the time was  contingent workforce.  Anne 
Polivka and Thomas Nardone defined this concept as 
</p>
<p> a wide range of employment practices, including part-time work, temporary 
work, employee leasing, self-employment, contracting out, and home-based 
work. As a result, the operational definition of a contingent job has become 
an arrangement that differs from full-time, permanent, wage, and salary em-
ployment. 6  
</p>
<p> &bdquo;Contracting out&permil; is a synonym for outsourcing. Karen Jette and Clay-Edward 
Dixon discussed contingent work in libraries in an article in  Library Administration &amp; 
Management,  noting that libraries have also employed that concept for many years. 7  
Their article has a sound section on the pros and cons of such work, including out-
sourcing. 
</p>
<p> As a cost-reduction tactic, outsourcing may be correct and effective in the short run 
but may have unexpected long-term consequences. No matter what one does, certain </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Outsourcing 65
</p>
<p>coordination costs will always be present. Reducing those coordination and monitoring 
costs results in long-term quality-control issues. Expertise that will be needed later may 
also be lost, and the cost of re-securing that expertise can be high. There may also be 
unexpected salary implications, if the activity outsourced involves staffing changes. 
</p>
<p> Despite these drawbacks, there is substantial potential for using outsourcing as 
another tool for helping to control costs and supplement or expand services. This is how 
libraries have effectively employed the concept in the past without labeling it &bdquo;outsourc-
ing.&permil; Two examples from acquisitions and one from cataloging illustrate the point that 
outsourcing has a long tradition in libraries. As mentioned previously, using a book or a 
serials jobber is not absolutely essential for libraries. A library could place all its orders 
for books or journals directly with the publishers. For very small libraries that may be 
a reasonable option. However, as the volume of orders increases, the work involved in 
maintaining address files, credit terms, discount information, and so forth from hun-
dreds or even thousands of publishers becomes prohibitive. Years ago, acquisitions li-
brarians saw the value of placing a single order with a jobber or wholesaler for the items 
needed from various publishers. (Placing one order for 100 books from 35 different 
publishers instead of placing 35 orders with the individual publishers saves staff time in 
order preparation alone.) The idea was not to reduce staff or cut costs; it was to make the 
most effective use of existing staff and control costs as much as possible. 
</p>
<p> Another example, and one that is not often mentioned as outsourcing, is the use 
of approval plans in academic libraries. In these plans, the vendor identifies items that 
match a list of subject areas that the library wants to collect and ships various materi-
als that fall into the category to the library for review and/or automatic inclusion into 
the collection. Thus, the library outsources the identification function, one of the basic 
library functions. Some approval plans allow for materials to arrive &bdquo;shelf ready&permil;&middot;that 
is, with spine labels already affixed, thus reducing the need for staff time devoted to 
processing such materials. 
</p>
<p> Cataloging departments have an equally long, if not longer, history of using out-
sourcing. For example, until widespread implementation of the ILS most libraries made 
extensive use of catalog cards produced by commercial companies and the Library of 
Congress (which started selling its cards in 1901). Certainly there was even greater 
use of the  National Union Catalog  (NUC) and  Canadiana  in creating cards for public 
catalogs. (One of this book&Ecirc;s authors well remembers his days as a cataloger with the 
responsibility of overseeing the duplication of LC/NUC and local copy for use in the 
library&Ecirc;s public catalog and shelflist.) No one thought of this as outsourcing; at best it 
may have been regarded as resource sharing (although libraries were depending on 
third parties to provide the product and did pay for the services and cards). By the 
1960s, there were efforts to create shared processing centers. These efforts resulted in 
bibliographic utilities such as OCLC. This form of outsourcing is an accepted and very 
valuable service. 
</p>
<p> A common first response to suggestions of using outsourcing for a library activity, 
especially cataloging, is the lack of quality control on the part of third parties. Local 
catalogers are known to &bdquo;correct mistakes&permil; made by the Library of Congress, and many 
have grave doubts that bibliographic records from other libraries can possibly be as ac-
curate as ones produced in-house. Obviously doubts about a third-party source (whether 
another library or a for-profit entity) are even greater. One of this book&Ecirc;s authors noted 
that the goal of the perfect catalog record and perfect public catalog is akin to seeking </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>66 4&mdash;Technical Services Issues
</p>
<p>the Holy Grail&middot;a worthy idea but, at least in the case of cataloging, highly unrealistic 
and costly in many ways for the library. 8  Certainly there are quality concerns, but they 
exist no matter where the work is done or by whom, and the reality is that perfection is 
highly unlikely to exist anywhere at a reasonable cost to the library and end-users. Qual-
ity of third-party work therefore should not be a limiting factor in deciding to move 
ahead with an outsourcing project; it should just be one of many issues that must be 
addressed. 
</p>
<p> COOPERATIVE/CONSORTIAL ACTIVITIES 
</p>
<p> Libraries have engaged in cooperative activities for a long time&middot;well over 100 
years. Thus, you would expect that they would have mastered the process. Overall they 
know what is necessary for achieving a successful cooperative venture. They have also 
learned that each new effort will bring with it some new challenges. They also know 
that truly successful programs must change with the changing times. 
</p>
<p> The Library of Congress&Ecirc;s distribution of cataloging information is one the very 
oldest of U.S. library cooperative programs. As mentioned previously, the program 
began late in 1901 with the distribution of catalog cards. Over the years it changed the 
manner of distribution (from card stock to online and individual title information within 
the publication&middot;called &bdquo;cataloging in publication&permil;) and expanded the number of librar-
ies that contribute data. As Martha Yee wrote: 
</p>
<p> This [ingenious] scheme, by which a shared cataloging program to lower cat-
aloging costs produced the equivalent of a national bibliography at the same 
time, has become the envy of the rest of the world. This approach is now very 
much taken for granted in the United States, but could not have happened with-
out the conjunction of a number of economic, political, and social factors. 9  
</p>
<p> Outside factors often play a key role in motivating cooperative/consortial activities 
to begin and affect the way in which they operate and change over time. 
</p>
<p> Another highly successful and long-standing endeavor is OCLC (close to 50 years 
old as we prepared this edition). During the 1960s, U.S. librarians engaged in a variety 
of efforts to create cooperative or centralized technical services centers. Some projects 
focused on a type of library, such as academic or public. Later efforts focused on multi-
type regional or statewide programs. The results of those efforts are OCLC, Inc., and 
state and regional networks (such as Lyrasis or OCLC Western) that go well beyond 
offering technical services activities. 
</p>
<p> There have been major expansions of consortial activities in the recent past. We 
will explore some of these expansions in the chapter on electronic resources (chapter 8). 
Briefly, one of the more recent efforts are resource sharing networks such as Ohio-
LINK (http://www.ohiolink.edu/ ) and California&Ecirc;s LINK+ (http://csul.iii.com/ ). Such 
networks are built and operate on the basis of libraries&Ecirc; collection databases, which are 
generated by their technical services units. 
</p>
<p> Most of the early efforts focused on internal library operations; certainly, they led 
to service improvements or reduced library costs, but they were not directly visible to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Cooperative/Consortial Activities 67
</p>
<p>the users. Many of today&Ecirc;s projects are something users see and appreciate. Shirley 
Kennedy reflected on the visibility aspect when she wrote: 
</p>
<p> Up until a couple of months ago I had not set foot in a public library in more 
than five years. . . . But one day, a colleague passed along some information 
about the county public library cooperative upgrading its online system, and I 
had to take a look. It&Ecirc;s awesome. . . . What is cool is that we have the Pinellas 
Automated Library System, which lets you browse or search through the col-
lections of all 15 member libraries, select or reserve materials, and have them 
sent to a library convenient to you. 10  
</p>
<p> We will cover systems like the two mentioned above in the chapters on e-resources 
and services (chapters 7, 8, and 9). (For an overview of older cooperative ventures, see 
chapter 4 of the last edition of this book view it online at http://lu.com/bookext.cfm, 
as a supplement to this edition, along with additional illustrations of technical services 
activities.) 
</p>
<p> The line between cooperative activities and consortia efforts is not sharp and never 
has been. Perhaps it easiest to think of cooperative ventures as less formalized. Gener-
ally, a consortia has some type of legal status (a nonprofit corporation for example). One 
of this book&Ecirc;s authors (Evans) had extensive experience with an operation that slowly 
grew from a small urban informal cooperative into a statewide nonprofit corporation 
(SCELC&middot;first as Southern California Electronic Library Cooperative and later as the 
Statewide California Electronic Library Consortium; http://scelc.org/). 
</p>
<p> Regardless of the label, the bottom line is that it is all about libraries working to-
gether to stretch funding, expand services, and share workloads or some other desired 
outcome. To be successful there must be trust and compromises and there must be true 
teamwork. 11  Technical services unit heads may or may not have a direct representation 
on the group that actually makes decisions regarding the venture, even though such 
decisions may affect the workload. Generally, the members of the controlling board are 
library directors. There is a practical reason for this; there must be the authority to com-
mit a library to new program elements or modifications of a program element. However, 
there must be thoughtful, meaningful, and ongoing consultation with technical services 
personnel for there to be success in any cooperative effort. 
</p>
<p> Magda El-Sherbini and Amanda Wilson in writing about alternative methods to 
distribute library resources, noted: 
</p>
<p> By eliminating the middle steps of creating, accessing, and retrieving informa-
tion via intermediaries such as regional consortia, OCLC, and costly OPACs, 
libraries might realize substantial savings that could be diverted to enrich 
bibliographic records that form the foundation of the current bibliographic 
structure. 12  
</p>
<p> Whether they are correct in their view that cutting out such cooperative activities will 
save money or better serve users seems to be a debatable point. What is clear is that con-
sortia provide visible and appreciated services to end-users who might well be unhappy 
about the loss of a valued program. </p>

</p>
<p> QUALITY ASSURANCE 
</p>
<p> Accountability and assessment are interrelated and are an important part of library 
operations. Certainly, accountability goes well beyond assessment; however, assess-
ment is one of the key elements in demonstrating accountability. Those who provide 
funds for library operations, be they public agencies or private individuals, expect value 
for their funds. Not too many years ago funders started asking for more than statistics 
about how the monies were expended. They want proof that the funds actually had a 
valuable outcome (outcome assessment). 
</p>
<p> Libraries also undertake assessments/evaluations of their programs in order to pub-
licize their worth to the public. Libraries and library staff have generally done a less than 
stellar job of educating their publics about the libraries&Ecirc; contributions to society. Joan 
Durrance and Karen Fisher stated the problem succinctly: &bdquo;The truth is that librarians 
have failed to explain to those outside the field what contributions they and their institu-
tions actually make to society at large.&permil; 13  Experts, legislators, and decision makers often 
ignore the vital role libraries play in supporting learning and developing an informed 
citizenry. This is seen no more clearly than in the perennial struggles for funding faced 
by public, school, and academic libraries, particularly in times of budget constraints. 
</p>
<p> What is known now as assessment began in most libraries with the collection and 
compilation of statistics about inputs and outputs (total dollars spent on how many 
books, for example). Initially, libraries developed the statistics primarily for internal 
reasons and secondarily for use in budget presentations. They wanted to use the infor-
mation gathered to improve library efficiency or effectiveness. Internally, the increasing 
complexity and cost of library operations, along with increasing demand for services, 
requires good information for planning and evaluation purposes. There was a need for 
objective, standardized data on which to base decisions. The statistics provide  some  
insight into current performance and allow the staff to see where improvements may 
be called for. They also help managers allocate resources, plan operations and services, 
and make better decisions. The data also help to assess the success of new programs 
and services. 
</p>
<p> Quantity rather than quality was the focus of most such initial data collection ef-
forts, which ultimately told the staff, funding bodies, and public little about the value of 
the spending activities. Circulation counts and the number of reference questions asked, 
books purchased, and items cataloged and processed are perhaps mildly interesting, 
but they provide no insight into their ultimate value. More recently, a shift has occurred 
toward measuring the quality of a library and its services. Despite this shift, traditional 
inputs and outputs are still valuable measures for determining if a library is function-
ing effectively and efficiently. They can be especially useful when enabling a library to 
compare its program to professional standards and to benchmarking data provided by 
other libraries. 
</p>
<p> Assessment and planning are intertwined. You cannot assess something until you 
know what the goal is for the activity being assessed. To be meaningful, the activity 
should be apart of plan. To be effective, plans must be long- and short-term in focus. 
This is not the place to review the planning process. However, basic institutional plan-
ning begins by defining the organizational mission and then developing long- and short-
term objectives and goals. Assessment and quality assurance draws on the planning 
process by </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Budgetary Issues 69
</p>
<p> &bull; establishing clear, relevant, and slightly stretching goals/targets; 
 &bull; designing and implementing activities to reach the goals; 
 &bull; evaluating if and how well the goals are achieved; and 
 &bull; revising or creating new activities to better achieve the desired outcome. 
</p>
<p> Essentially, quality control and assessment help the library and its funders gather infor-
mation about how well it is achieving the agreed-upon goals. 
</p>
<p> Because technical services activities do not usually involve direct contact with the 
end-users, the challenges of assessment can be rather substantial. Libraries are required 
to develop strategic plans and to review them annually, keeping a strong focus on the 
outcomes of all their activities. Identifying appropriate goals that relate to user outcomes 
can be challenging. However, it is an area that technical services staff must address. 
</p>
<p> BUDGETARY ISSUES 
</p>
<p> Budget considerations have played a significant role in determining all aspects of 
library services, not just technical services, over the past 30 years. They will be even 
more so in light of the economic downturn that began in 2008. All of the usual eco-
nomic and financial suspects appear on the following list of influences: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Overall economic conditions 
 &bull; Reluctance of taxpayers to raise taxes (and in some cases rolling them back) 
 &bull; Shifting allocation priorities by funding authorities 
 &bull; Increasing prices of collection materials, perhaps not as rapidly as in the past 
</p>
<p>but still rising 
 &bull; Rapidly changing technology and the constant need to upgrade systems. 
</p>
<p> We are likely to see phrases such as &bdquo;small is beautiful,&permil; &bdquo;less is more,&permil; &bdquo;downsiz-
ing,&permil; and &bdquo;reengineering&permil; become commonplace once again. They all reflect the idea 
that organizations could be more effective, often with fewer staff. For libraries, the ap-
proaches represented by these expressions resulted in major changes in services, staff-
ing, and collections in the past and will do so again. 
</p>
<p> Government officials understand that voters want certain services maintained re-
gardless of economic conditions. Police, fire, sanitation, and road maintenance services 
are high priorities. Services such as schools, libraries, museums, and parks have to 
struggle for a share of the small amount of funding that remains after top-priority ser-
vices are almost fully funded. Often the best a library can hope for is funding at the same 
level as the previous year. 
</p>
<p> While addressing these challenges, libraries also face the need to install a variety of 
technologies and then maintain them at an appropriate level, if the library is to remain 
a viable player in the information society. Technology changes rapidly, and it is often 
impossible not to move forward with those changes if one hopes to receive support for 
the technology. Upgrading always seems to cost more than expected, which puts an ad-
ditional strain on the budget. 
</p>
<p> All of these factors, and others, create an environment in which libraries face dif-
ficult financial and service choices. Initially, some libraries thought reducing service 
hours might prompt end-users to demand that authorities increase funding to restore </p>
<p/>

<p>70 4&mdash;Technical Services Issues
</p>
<p>service levels, but this seldom happens. Another approach that almost every library tries 
is to reduce its collection-building activities. One change is to reduce one-time pur-
chases&middot;books and media formats&middot;to maintain current journal subscriptions. How-
ever, year after year of double-digit price increases in serial prices force libraries to 
engage in serial and/or database cancellation projects while also trying to maintain or 
increase book purchases as those collections began showing serious signs of aging. 
</p>
<p> One of the other frequently seen outcomes of the overall reduction or minimal 
growth in the library budget is changes in staffing patterns. Sometimes this takes the 
form of hiring freezes (not being allowed to fill a staff vacancy) for long periods of time 
or furloughs (unpaid leave). At other times it involves losing a position when a staff 
member resigns (staff attrition). Occasionally, it is outright staff reductions through 
voluntary or involuntary terminations (called &bdquo;reductions in force,&permil; &bdquo;riffing,&permil; or &bdquo;redun-
dancy&permil; depending on location). Not surprisingly, having fewer one-time purchases and 
fewer serial titles to process, as well as seeing an overall drop in the number of materials 
to catalog, means technical services faces pressure to reduce its staff. It also means that 
there is pressure to look at alternative methods for handling the workload. One such 
method is outsourcing, as discussed earlier. 
</p>
<p> SPACES FOR TECHNICAL SERVICES 
</p>
<p> Currently, there is a debate about the role of the library as &bdquo;place,&permil; although most 
of this is focused on how end-users and, to a lesser extent, how collections are accom-
modated. In all of the ongoing efforts to make library buildings more accessible, more 
user-friendly, more technologically sophisticated, and more energy efficient, less atten-
tion has been paid to the spaces assigned to technical services operations. This is not to 
say that technical services is neglected in the planning of new and renovated buildings, 
but rather that most of what has happened in the way of change turns out to be more of 
a by-product of the larger set of issues confronting space planners. 
</p>
<p> The following are among the most significant factors affecting space planning for 
technical services: 
</p>
<p> &bull; The ubiquitous use of computers as an essential component of almost all 
activities. This includes the use of fixed workstations and the use of portable 
laptops and other small devices. The widespread use of wireless technology 
has expanded libraries&Ecirc; flexibility in deploying this technology. 
</p>
<p> &bull; The increased use of commercial processing services&middot;outsourcing&middot;princi-
pally in public libraries, has certainly had an impact on the amount of space 
required in-house. 
</p>
<p> &bull; On the other hand, for libraries that do their own processing, the wider range 
of materials being acquired and processed (e.g., CD, DVD, computer soft-
ware, kits) requires space and furnishings that are more varied than in the 
time when libraries had to deal only with books and journals. 
</p>
<p> &bull; The overall decrease in the number of paper subscriptions received by librar-
ies of all types. 
</p>
<p> &bull; The greater attention being paid to issues of ergonomics, lighting, air quality, 
and green buildings than ever before. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Spaces for Technical Services 71
</p>
<p> &bull; The Americans With Disabilities Act, which has enormous implications not 
only for public spaces in libraries but also for staff workplaces. 
</p>
<p> &bull; The recognized need for flexibility of space to meet future needs as well as 
for these spaces to respond to current requirements. 
</p>
<p> &bull; The more varied nature of many technical services staff positions in terms 
of work components, which often brings with it the need for access to more 
kinds of space and equipment. 
</p>
<p> Some Key Issues 
</p>
<p> Significantly more library building projects involve interior renovations and rear-
rangements than the construction of new buildings. This has been the case for decades, 
and it is extremely unlikely that the situation will change for the foreseeable future. The 
issues outlined here are applicable to both existing and new spaces, but clearly, in large 
academic and public libraries, the relocation of technical services departments, while 
possibly desirable, is much more difficult. 
</p>
<p> Historically, technical services operations were situated with major concern about 
their proximity to the card catalog, printed bibliographic tools, materials receiving and 
delivery, and, in small public libraries, to their service points. In today&Ecirc;s environment 
a number of these relationships have become less critical, and this provides an oppor-
tunity to rethink where technical services might be located. The impact of requiring 
processing operations to meet the several requirements listed above inevitably led to 
most of the departments being on the main (entry) level because that is usually where 
the catalog and the reference collection were located. There are fewer constraints about 
location now that the traditional card catalog is gone and most major bibliographic tools 
are available online. It is also clear that good vertical access to receiving and delivery 
via elevator are an appropriate alternative to being close to the loading dock. 
</p>
<p> A recent trend, especially among large academic research libraries and large urban 
public libraries, is to move all or part of technical services offsite. Although such remote 
locations existed in the past, for example at the California State University&ndash;Northridge 
in the late 1960s and 1970s, technology has significantly accelerated the practice. The 
rationale for this has been primarily to increase the amount of space available for public 
services and collections. Critics of the separation of technical services have cited as 
downside effects the loss of collegiality with the rest of the staff, the inconvenience for 
faculty and students who may need to visit technical services, and the additional costs 
associated with materials delivery. However, it appears likely the trend will continue. 
</p>
<p> Planning Issues 
</p>
<p> The emancipation of technical services from its physical proximity to the public 
catalog permits space planners to consider a variety of locations within the building. 
The factors that should influence the location include: 
</p>
<p> &bull; The need for convenient access to receiving and delivery areas. As noted 
earlier, this does not mean that technical services departments need to be 
adjacent to the loading dock. It does mean that there should be horizontal or </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>72 4&mdash;Technical Services Issues
</p>
<p>vertical access that ideally does not involve extensive travel through public 
areas of the library. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Libraries in which faculty and others have to review approval plan materials 
or items being considered for transfer to storage or withdrawal need space 
within their technical services area where these activities can be conducted. 
These areas need to be accessible to the public. While they do not have to be 
front and center, it does suggest the need to be on a major traffic route with a 
visible entry. Having visitors on a regular basis also brings with it the need to 
design the interior space to ensure that materials in process are secure. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Technical services departments clearly need to be accessible to other library 
staff. This is especially true where the collection development function is not 
part of technical services. This is also important where there is a separate 
preservation/conservation unit. 
</p>
<p> &bull; In smaller libraries, especially small public libraries, processing operations 
are often staffed by people who have other responsibilities, including work-
ing with the public. This needs to be considered in deciding where to locate 
the backroom functions. 
</p>
<p> A series of planning questions will inevitably arise in looking at existing technical 
services spaces and in planning areas in new or renovated buildings. Whatever the situ-
ation, the key factors that should influence interior design include future flexibility; the 
efficient movement of people and materials; the security of materials in process; and 
a comfortable, ergonomically effective, and inviting space for those who work in the 
area. It may be obvious but should be said that many library staff spend seven to eight 
hours within the building, primarily during the daytime, yet in many buildings they do 
not have adequate access to natural light. Reader spaces are often given higher priority 
to windows even though much use of that space takes place after the sun goes down. 
</p>
<p> In looking at how best to organize and arrange spaces for technical services, plan-
ners should be concerned about the following: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Will the space work better as one large, open space or as a series of connected 
departmental areas? How important is it to retain the identity of acquisitions, 
serials, cataloging, and so on? Will the current organizational structure be 
around in 5 to 10 years? If change is anticipated, how can this best be accom-
modated? Is it conceivable that technical services space could become public 
space? How does this influence location and design? 
</p>
<p> &bull; What is the basis for providing enclosed office space versus open worksta-
tions? It is feasible to create a spacious, comfortable, and efficient work area 
without erecting floor-to-ceiling walls. The use of partitions and office land-
scaping can provide a sense of privacy and separateness without incurring 
the additional costs for lighting and air supply and return. Many libraries 
have given up the concept of private offices, even for department heads and 
supervisors, and rely instead on having a number of enclosed spaces that can 
be used when needed on a sign-up basis. If private offices are to be included, 
they should be designed as generically as possible so that changes in admin-
istrative responsibility and organizational structure can be accommodated. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Spaces for Technical Services 73
</p>
<p> &bull; The organization of space should reflect the efficient flow of materials within 
the department. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Individual work spaces should provide sufficient space for the variety of ac-
tivities taking place. This includes space for computers, tabletop work sur-
faces, book trucks, file cabinets, and shelving. 
</p>
<p> &bull; It is highly desirable to centralize as many service functions as possible 
within the larger space, including copiers, scanners, printers, fax machines, 
and supply cabinets. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Recognize that materials in process often do not have security devices, so 
there should be good perimeter security&middot;doors and windows&middot;and lockable 
storage for valuable materials. Every staff member should likewise have a 
secure space for personal items. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Space should be provided for staff meetings. This can be accommodated by 
a variety of mechanisms&middot;meeting space within an enclosed office, open 
meeting space in a common area, a closed meeting room within the technical 
services area, or use of meeting spaces elsewhere in the building. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Space should also be provided for training current and new staff. This may 
be accomplished by using facilities elsewhere in the library (e.g., computer 
labs or classrooms), but large technical services departments probably need a 
dedicated training space. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Shelving should be designed and located to provide convenience and flex-
ibility. The use of movable compact shelving should be considered for stor-
ing items that do not have to be immediately accessible (e.g., arrearages, 
incoming gifts, exchange stock, materials awaiting bindery pickup). There 
also needs to be shelving appropriate for the storage of nonbook items, such 
as CDs, DVD, and archives. Art books and music may also require custom-
ized shelving. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Technical services areas need to be planned with consideration of current 
and future technological requirements. Attention should be paid to power and 
network connectivity, including wireless access. It is critical that the space be 
able to adapt to changes in equipment and operations. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Carpeting is recommended for all spaces except shipping and receiving; this 
will enhance noise control. 
</p>
<p> &bull; The amount of space to be allocated should reflect the number of staff to be 
housed and the amount of material that is moving into and through the de-
partment. In general, technical services departments require between 100 and 
150 square feet per staff member. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Space should be provided for all of the book trucks that are being used. 
 &bull; Space requirements for some specific spaces within technical services 
</p>
<p>departments: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Enclosed office:  120&ndash;150 square feet 
 &bull; Open staff workstation: 80&ndash;100 square feet 
 &bull; Student workstation:  50&ndash;60 square feet 
 &bull; Work table (3 feet &times; 8 feet) 100 square feet 
</p>
<p> &bull; Technical services staff need convenient access to restrooms and the staff 
lounge, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>74 4&mdash;Technical Services Issues
</p>
<p> &bull; Libraries that use volunteers to help process materials and provide other sup-
port need to make sure there are appropriate and sufficient workspaces for 
these people. 
</p>
<p> Administrative offices and workstations should be located to provide both visibil-
ity and privacy. Conference rooms and/or meeting spaces also require privacy. There 
also needs to be accommodation for support personnel and for a reception area. 
</p>
<p> The kinds of activities that could be accommodated in a shared area within techni-
cal services include: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Mail opening and sorting 
 &bull; Staff mailboxes 
 &bull; Staff restrooms 
 &bull; Sink 
 &bull; Kitchen 
</p>
<p> A mail-opening area requires a number of spaces: sorting tables, mailboxes, trash 
receptacles, and a counter if outgoing mail is also involved. There needs to be shelving 
for incoming books and books in process. If there is an approval area, there should be 
shelving that is easily accessible along with chairs and tables. There also needs to be 
separate shelving for books being reviewed for weeding or relocation, shelving or file 
cabinets for publisher&Ecirc;s catalogs, and part-time and student workstations. 
</p>
<p> Although the mail/receiving function is not necessarily part of technical services, 
it has a critical relationship with that area. Some of the planning issues that often arise 
include: 
</p>
<p> &bull; How to monitor mail delivery if the area is not staffed 
 &bull; The need for storage space for incoming supplies and equipment 
 &bull; The need for a separate, secure storage space for special collections and 
</p>
<p>archives 
 &bull; The need for convenient access to elevator 
 &bull; The need to have no building air supply intake anywhere near the loading 
</p>
<p>dock 
 &bull; The need for a canopy or other weather protection 
 &bull; The need for double-width doors leading from the loading dock into the 
</p>
<p>building 
</p>
<p> The question of enclosed versus open offices for cataloging personnel is a com-
mon planning issue. The work is more detail oriented than most of the other technical 
services activities and having a relatively noise free work environment is important. The 
challenge for the planning team is how to achieve the necessary work environment for 
catalogers without creating resentment on the part of the technical services staff that 
do not have private offices. If end-processing takes place here, there needs to be space 
provision for label printers and for the substantial amount of supplies that are used. 
Cataloging of nonprint material, including microforms, requires viewing equipment 
and appropriate work space. 
</p>
<p> Planning new or renovated space for technical services operations requires careful 
consideration of both current practice and potential changes. While these areas are not </p>

<p>Notes 75
</p>
<p>as visible as an information commons or a reading room, they still need to be designed 
to provide for maximum efficiency and flexibility and for the well-being of those who 
work there. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> Technical services units are facing a great many issues. Without question, technol-
ogy is an ongoing issue for libraries, not just technical services. Staying reasonably 
current is expensive. Training staff and helping them stay up-to-date with technological 
developments is a constant challenge. Even the library&Ecirc;s OPAC is undergoing changes 
as users apparently now go first to the Web when seeking information. As budgets be-
come tighter and tighter, libraries will turn to even greater use of cooperative efforts 
and consortia to stretch limited funds. That type of shift will present some additional 
issues in terms of accountability and assessment for the individual institutions and their 
funding bodies as they become increasingly dependent upon actions of other librar-
ies. Certainly the current economic environment is not conducive to asking for budget 
increases; the fight is to keep something close to recent past allocations. The situation 
is likely to remain tight for some time to come, at least for libraries. The final issue 
touched on in this chapter was physical space for technical services activities. Given the 
current economic downturn, it is likely that the best technical services can hope for is 
an occasional influx of funding to upgrade/remodel existing spaces. Those units that do 
have the opportunity to design a new area will be very, very fortunate.

<p>5    Acquisitions&mdash;Overview 
</p>
<p> Acquisitions forms a vital link in the cycle of publishing, selection, request, 
and providing materials for use. The imperatives for acquisitions staff are to 
find and acquire material as quickly as possible, while offering an efficient 
and responsive service. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Liz Chapman, 2004 
</p>
<p> The definition of &bdquo;acquire&permil; has also evolved far beyond purchasing, subscrib-
ing, and licensing. Acquisitions activities now include&middot;and in the future will 
increasingly include&middot;issues of rights management. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Vera Fessler, 2007 
</p>
<p> The whats and hows of acquisitions work have probably changed more than other 
technical function during the 40-plus years this title has existed. Although our open-
ing quotation from Liz Chapman could well have stood as opening to the chapter on 
acquisitions in the first edition of this book, how those basic roles currently play out 
is vastly different from the past. Vera Fessler&Ecirc;s quotation suggests, in broad strokes, 
just what some of the changes entail. 
</p>
<p> The contribution of the acquisitions department to the library&Ecirc;s public service func-
tion consists primarily of handling the business of ordering and receiving the materials 
selected for inclusion in the collection. Not all additions to the collection are the re-
sult of purchases; some are gifts or exchanges. The term &bdquo;collections&permil; goes far beyond 
physical objects. Much of the information libraries provide access to is electronic and 
most of those data are Web-based. 
</p>
<p> The acquisitions department is usually responsible for handling all the financial 
aspects associated with the library being able to legally make the information (print </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>82 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview
</p>
<p>or electronic) available to the public. Most of the work requires some knowledge of 
computers, the Internet, and search techniques. Support staff does a large portion of 
the work in this department because very little of it requires graduate-level education. 
In some libraries, the acquisitions department does not have even one librarian staff 
member. Library acquisitions work only covers the procedures used in buying or 
otherwise acquiring materials for the collection. Acquiring office supplies and library 
equipment, such as computers, desks, or book trucks, is seldom part of the acquisi-
tions department&Ecirc;s duties. 
</p>
<p> A common misconception is that acquisitions departments determine what ma-
terials are in the library&Ecirc;s collections. Decisions regarding what to add to a col-
lection are rarely made in acquisitions, although even this is changing. The usual 
practice is that some other group (usually the collection development or selection 
staff) makes such decisions and passes the request on to the acquisition staff to 
secure the item. 
</p>
<p> COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITIONS 
</p>
<p> A library&Ecirc;s mission, regardless of type, is to serve the information needs of its 
end-users. The purpose of collection development is to select materials to serve the 
information, educational, and/or recreational needs of its primary service community. 
However, broad objectives such as these are difficult to interpret because one per-
son&Ecirc;s recreation may be another&Ecirc;s education. Each type of library&middot;academic, public, 
school, or special&middot;has a set of specific service objectives designed to support the 
community&Ecirc;s activities. Selection officers must know the community and its informa-
tion needs. They devote time gaining an understanding of the community or institu-
tion they serve as well as learning what materials are available to satisfy a given need. 
Limited financial resources mean most libraries can only acquire a percentage of the 
relevant and desired material during a budget cycle; thus, selection officers must de-
cide which needs and items are the highest priority. 
</p>
<p> Selection policies help reduce some of the problems of making such decisions. 
In all but the smallest libraries, several individuals normally share the responsibility 
for selecting materials. Naturally, the involvement of several people in the selection 
process increases the need for coordinating and understanding selection procedures. 
Policies usually include all of the following: 
</p>
<p> &bull; A statement regarding who has the authority to select materials. Often the 
director has this authority but delegates it to staff members. In such cases, 
this must be clearly stated. 
</p>
<p> &bull; A statement concerning who is responsible for selecting materials. 
 &bull; A statement of the library&Ecirc;s goals and objectives for its collections. 
 &bull; A list of the criteria for selecting materials. 
 &bull; A list of review sources used in selecting materials. 
 &bull; An outline of the procedures for handling problems (complaints about hav-
</p>
<p>ing or not having certain items). 
 &bull; Guidelines for allocating available funds for the collections. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Collection Development and Acquisitions 83
</p>
<p> Collection development and acquisitions have always been closely coordinated, if not 
integrated, in libraries and information centers with successful programs. In an in-
creasingly electronic environment, that coordination is vital. Joyce Ogburn noted: 
</p>
<p> Managing an acquisitions program calls for a special set of skills and activi-
ties: assessment, prediction, control, choice, validation, and quantification. 
Libraries assess the risk and feasibility of acquisition, the availability of the 
resources, and the chances of success, control the system and methods needed, 
the choice of the source, the supporting services, and the resources them-
selves; and quantify the resources, work, and costs involved to conduct the 
business of acquisitions and measures of success. 1  
</p>
<p> Such skills and activities are a constant, but today&Ecirc;s libraries may need to draw upon the 
expertise of a number of staff members to acquire the desired electronic resources. Two 
of the factors that generate this need are that most e-resources are leased not purchased 
(legal contracts are the norm) and that many may be paid for through a consortia that 
may often have very different requirements for handling the acquisition process than a 
local library (more about both issues in later chapters). 
</p>
<p> Beyond the obvious purpose of supporting overall library objectives, the acquisi-
tions department has both library-wide goals and departmental goals. Library-wide 
goals can be grouped into five broad areas of purpose: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Develop a knowledge of information producers operations 
 &bull; Help in the selection and collection development process 
 &bull; Process requests for items to be added to the collection 
 &bull; Monitor the expenditure of collection development funds 
 &bull; Maintain all required records and produce reports regarding the expendi-
</p>
<p>ture of funds 
</p>
<p> By disseminating materials from the various information producers and vendors, 
the acquisitions department aids in the selection process, even if there is a duplication of 
information. Because most information producers are uncertain about who in the library 
makes purchasing decisions, they frequently send multiple copies of their promotional 
material to a library. This is not surprising, as producers buy a number of mailing lists 
to use when promoting a new or revised product, resulting in several copies of the pro-
motional literature being received by a single staff member. However, a librarian should 
not assume that a promotional piece of no interest did, in fact, reach the appropriate staff 
member. 
</p>
<p> Acquisitions departments gather information regarding changes in publishing sched-
ules, new producers, and new services from existing producers/suppliers. Many acquisi-
tions departments serve as clearinghouses for this type of information for the library. 
Indeed, in larger libraries, the department sometimes operates a limited selective dis-
semination of information (SDI) system by routing information to selectors based on 
each individual&Ecirc;s subject or area of responsibility. Despite the changing technological 
environment, there is no particular reason to change the location of such activities unless 
there is a major reorganization. Figure 5.1 illustrates the basic functions of an acquisitions 
department.    </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>84 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview
</p>
<p> Acquisitions departments also have internal goals. Following are four common 
goals: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Acquire materials as quickly as possible. 
 &bull; Maintain a high level of accuracy in all work procedures. 
 &bull; Keep work processes simple to achieve the lowest possible unit cost. 
 &bull; Develop close, friendly working relationships with other library units and 
</p>
<p>vendors. 
</p>
<p> Speed is a significant factor in meeting end-user expectations and determining their 
satisfaction, a key issue in how they assess the library&Ecirc;s quality. A system that requires 
three or four months to secure items that are available in local bookstores will create a 
serious public relations problem. However, a system that is fast but error prone increases 
</p>

<p>Types of Materials Acquired 85
</p>
<p>operating costs and wastes the time and energy of departmental staff and vendors. By 
keeping procedures simple and periodically reviewing workflow, the department can 
help the library provide top-quality service. 
</p>
<p> Speed, accuracy, and thrift should be the watchwords of acquisitions departments. 
Certainly online ordering, electronic invoicing, and credit-card payments greatly en-
hance the speed with which the department can handle much of the traditional paper-
work. What has not changed much is the speed with which items actually arrive. The 
label &bdquo;snail mail&permil; is still all too often appropriate for the shipping speed, unless one is 
willing to pay a premium price for faster service. 
</p>
<p> As of 2010, the American Library Association (ALA) had four published stan-
dards/guidelines relating to acquisitions: 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Guide to Performance Evaluation of Serial Vendors  
 &bull;  Guide to Selecting and Acquiring CD-ROMs, Software, and other Electronic 
</p>
<p>Publications  
 &bull;  Guide to Handling Approval Plans  
 &bull;  Guide to Preservation in Acquisition Processing  
</p>
<p> ALA has a number of other guidelines/standards for library activities that may have 
implications for acquisitions departments depending on the type of library and the ser-
vice population. (To review the many options to consider, see the American Library 
Association Web site at http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/ors/standardsa.) 
</p>
<p> TYPES OF MATERIALS ACQUIRED 
</p>
<p> Print Materials 
</p>
<p> Books and printed materials still represent a significant percentage of library pur-
chases. Publishers in the United States still produce more than 30,000 new titles each 
year and more than 10,000 new editions. Even if libraries devoted all their acquisitions 
funds to buying print items, few could (and would want to) buy the total output. Large 
book jobbers, dealing only in English-language books, have hundreds of thousands of 
titles in stock. Out-of-print materials dealers have millions of English language titles 
for sale. Adding in books in all other languages the number is in the tens of millions. 
Almost any of these titles could be of interest to some library. 
</p>
<p> In addition to books, thousands of periodical and serial titles appear in print every 
year. Government documents&middot;national, state, local, and international&middot;are another 
category of printed material acquired by libraries of all sizes, although more and more 
of these items are in a being issued in digital format (see chapter 9). Further, many schol-
arly publications, dissertations, theses, and publications of learned societies primar-
ily appear in print. Atlases, sheet maps (topographic maps; county highway maps; maps 
of national parks, forests, and recreation areas; aviation charts; and navigational charts), 
folded maps (highway maps), raised relief maps, and globes are staples in many library 
collections. 
</p>
<p> Printed music is another category of material that should be familiar to acquisitions 
department personnel. Piano-vocal scores, miniature scores, and monumental sets are 
in larger library collections. Pamphlets and ephemera of all types (broadsides, house </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>86 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview
</p>
<p>organs, personal papers, and documents) are also part of material the acquisitions de-
partment orders and receives. 
</p>
<p> An unfolding issue at the time we prepared this chapter (in 2010) is the Google 
book-scanning project. The project and all its implications is much too complicated to 
cover in this book. However, if the courts uphold an agreement reached in 2008 between 
copyright holders and Google, the way libraries approach collection development may 
well change. Google has and is scanning millions of books housed in research libraries 
across the United States. Many of the books included in project are covered by copy-
right. Google plans on selling access to its scanned materials and has set aside money to 
compensate rights holders of titles still under copyright but not commercially available. 
One aspect that does not appear clear yet is whether &bdquo;commercially available&permil; includes 
the out-of-print dealers. In any event, the final court decision is likely to affect acquisi-
tions work to some extent. 
</p>
<p> Nonbook Materials 
</p>
<p> Popular media formats are audiotapes (books on tape, for example), music CD 
recordings, and DVDs. Most libraries (medium-sized or larger) have at least a small 
audio collection. Public and school libraries tend to have larger media collections, and 
DVDs are among the most circulated items in many public libraries. Libraries face a 
number of challenges in acquiring these items, but many of the steps used to order a 
book apply to these other media as well (see chapter 10). 
</p>
<p> A format that is a crossover between paper and media is the microformat. Micro-
film and microfiche are the two most common forms. They were a very common me-
dium that saved shelf space for large quantities of relatively low-use print materials 
such as newspapers or collections of rare books. Many libraries still have legacy collec-
tions of microforms, and some out-of-print titles are only available in a microformat. 
</p>
<p> Electronic Resources 
</p>
<p> Electronic resources also come in a variety of forms: CDs, tape loads, and Web 
resources. Many of the products are variations of print-based materials, such as encyclo-
pedias, indexes, and abstracting services. Others are the full text of print-based publica-
tions, such as books and journals. Still others are original publications in an electronic 
format. More and more products are appearing that are multimedia in character, includ-
ing text, sound, and graphics. Each variation has some special features that must be taken 
into consideration at the time of acquisition. There are also special legal issues with 
electronic resources that do not arise with print-based items. These points are explored 
in chapter 7. 
</p>
<p> A library&Ecirc;s collection exists to achieve certain objectives: education, information, 
aesthetic appreciation, recreation, and research. Each objective requires a different mix 
of formats. Aesthetic appreciation often requires recorded music, dramatic readings, 
and visual and graphic materials of various types. Research objectives often require 
acquiring report literature and conference papers and proceedings. The acquisition of 
these materials requires in-depth knowledge about the materials and suitable sources 
of supply. </p>

<p>General Procedures 87
</p>
<p> GENERAL PROCEDURES 
</p>
<p> Staffing patterns vary in acquisitions departments, but a librarian is almost always 
the department&Ecirc;s ultimate supervisor. As the workload increases, the library may di-
vide the work into several subunits. Generally, support staff members have the super-
visory responsibility for the subunits. A very large library might have separate units 
for verification, ordering, bookkeeping, receiving, bindery preparation, and gifts and 
exchange. Most verification activities are the responsibility of library support staff or 
part-time help. 
</p>
<p> Request Processing 
</p>
<p> The first step in the acquisitions process is to organize the incoming requests. Re-
quests to purchase an item arrive in the department in a variety of forms, especially if 
nonlibrary staff are allowed to request material; they may range from oral requests to 
a scrawled note on a napkin, a completed request form, and everything in between. 
Department staff organize all requests to a standard format so they can carry out their 
work efficiently. Each library will have its own request form, generally in a paper ver-
sion and an electronic version somewhere on the library&Ecirc;s Web site, if the public may 
submit requests. 
</p>
<p> Commercially produced request cards cover all the following categories of infor-
mation that suppliers need to accurately fulfill an order: author, title, publisher, date of 
publication, edition, International Standard Book Number (ISBN) or International Stan-
dard Serial Number (ISSN), Standard Address Number (SAN), price, and number of 
copies. Many forms provide space for other information that is of interest only to librar-
ies, such as requester&Ecirc;s name, series, vendor, funding source, and approval signature. 
Sample request forms are illustrated in Figures 5.2 and 5.3.   
</p>
<p>Figure 5.2. Book request form.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>88 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview
</p>
<p> Note that problems may arise with the request forms. For example, users sometimes 
request items already in the collection because they do not know how to use the public 
catalog effectively, or people occasionally combine or confuse authors&Ecirc; names, titles, 
publishers, and so forth. Therefore, verification work is normally the first step in acquisi-
tions process. 
</p>
<p> Liz Chapman provided a good six-point checklist for designing or selecting a 
request form: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Is it easy for users to fill in? 
 &bull; Does it provide a logical checking route for library staff? 
 &bull; Does the checked form reflect the order in which data will be input to the 
</p>
<p>order system or put onto an order form? 
 &bull; Does it provide an accessible format for checking during the stage  after  the 
</p>
<p>book has been ordered but  before  it has arrived? 
 &bull; Does it provide an efficient format for checking that the book you receive 
</p>
<p>is the one you ordered? 
 &bull; Will it be able to move with the book from acquisitions through cataloging 
</p>
<p>and processing? 2  
</p>
<p> Verifying 
</p>
<p> Verifying or searching consists of two steps: establishing the existence of a partic-
ular item and determining whether the library needs to order the item. In the first case, 
the concern is with identifying the correct author, title, publisher, and other necessary 
ordering data. In the second step, the process determines the library&Ecirc;s need for the item: Is

</p>
<p>it already in the collection? Is it on order? Is it received but not yet represented in the 
public catalog? Is there a need for a second copy or multiple copies? These are a few 
examples of why the step is necessary. The ILSs make this latter step quick and easy, 
except for determining the need for additional copies. Many systems have the capabil-
ity of displaying order and received status in the OPAC, which reduces the number of 
duplicate requests. (Most ILSs provide two modes of operation&middot;staff and public. The 
library has options of how much information is displayed and in what form it will be 
available, such as the MARC record, in the public mode.) 
</p>
<p> Where to begin the process? The answer depends on the library&Ecirc;s collection-
development system. If the forms are filled out by experienced selection personnel, 
then determining the need is generally the most efficient way to start. A study by Karen 
Schmidt of incoming requests and the cost of preorder searching indicated that between 
30 and 40 percent of nonlibrarian requests are incorrect or for items already in the 
collection. 3  When a large percentage of the requests are from users, it is advisable to 
start with determining the existence of the title requested. 
</p>
<p> Corporate authors (see chapter 15), conference papers, proceedings, or transac-
tions are the most troublesome to search. Fortunately, keyword searching has eased, but 
not eliminated, the challenge. Titles do not change after publication and are easier to 
search. Main-entry searching requires a greater knowledge of cataloging rules, which, 
in turn, requires more time for training searchers and more time spent searching. 
</p>
<p> One area where technical services work can become challenging may arise at this 
stage. The question is who should establish the main entry? Certainly, it will save staff 
time if the data start off in the ILS in the desired form, and that will save time in the 
cataloging process. However, doing so requires more knowledge of cataloging on the 
part of the verification staff than was common in the past. Also, unless there was or is 
some rethinking of workload requirements the acquisitions department may find it dif-
ficult to take on new duties. Electronic capabilities make the determination relatively 
easy, however, if one understands the basics of cataloging. 
</p>
<p> There are some common problems to be aware of when doing verification work. 
One obvious problem is variant spellings of an author&Ecirc;s name, both first and last, such as 
the last names Smith, Smythe, Johnson, or Johnsen or a first name such as Gail, Gale, 
or Gayle. Another problem is variations of the author&Ecirc;s name that appear in a publi-
cation, for example, Ed Evans, Edward Evans, Edward G. Evans, G. Edward Evans, 
Gayle Edward Evans, or Gayle E. Evans. Each of these variations has appeared on at 
least one of Evans&Ecirc;s publications. Corporate author entries provide even bigger chal-
lenges to the searcher&Ecirc;s imagination and ingenuity (see chapter 15). Collected works 
and joint authors also present challenges for searchers. They must use their imagina-
tion when working with problem requests. Some libraries maintain a name-authority 
file (see chapter 15 for details), especially libraries with online catalogs, which can be 
of great assistance with variant forms of a name. 
</p>
<p> There are several files to check when establishing the library&Ecirc;s need for an item; 
this is true whether the files are paper or electronic. The most obvious starting point 
is the OPAC. Starting with a title search is a sound approach; titles rarely change after 
publication. In some libraries, even if there is an online public catalog, there may be 
several other paper-based public catalogs to search, for example, special collections or 
a media catalog, and all should be part of the checking process, if appropriate. Audio-
visual materials, government documents, serials, and collections in special locations </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>90 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview
</p>
<p>often may not be fully represented in the OPAC because their records are not yet in 
digital form. Other public service files that searchers need to examine are those for 
lost, missing, or damaged items (replacement files). The searcher would not examine 
all of these files for all items, but merely for those requests for items found in the 
OPAC but not marked &bdquo;added copy&permil; or &bdquo;replacement.&permil; 
</p>
<p> Online systems are available in many libraries to speed preorder checking.  Books 
in Print  is available in both a print and online version. Other commercial bibliographic 
selection aids are also available in electronic formats. Networks such as OCLC have 
large bibliographic databases that ease verification work. Integrated automation sys-
tems have eased the workload on some aspects of acquisitions. For example, it is pos-
sible to download bibliographic data from networks or from other libraries. With some 
systems, the staff can use the downloaded data to prepare a computer-generated order 
form, provide an online status report, and create the basis for local cataloging work. 
In some libraries, a person responsible for preorder activities may be able to do 90 per-
cent or more of the work at one terminal merely by moving between the ILS and 
Internet. 
</p>
<p> Verification work can be quickly carried out employing the catalogs of the Li-
brary of Congress (LC; http://www.loc.gov), Library and Archives Canada (http://
www.amicus.collectionscanada.ca/, which includes holdings of more than 1,300 
Canadian libraries), the British Library (http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/), or the National 
Library of Australia (http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/). The LC search offers 14 options: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Keyword 
 &bull; Title keyword 
 &bull; Author/creator keyword 
 &bull; Subject keyword 
 &bull; Name/title keyword 
 &bull; Series/uniform title keyword

 &bull; Author/creator sorted by title browse 
</p>
<p> The page also offers tips on how to best use each option. OCLC&Ecirc;s WorldCat offers a 
basic and advanced search option. With the advanced option one can include keyword, 
title, and author, language, format, content, and audience&middot;and limit by date&middot;in a sin-
gle search. Needless to say these sites cut down verification time dramatically. They 
can also supply cataloging data. 
</p>
<p> One of the authors (Evans) looks after a modest-size library (200,000+ items) 
and archives with the assistance of eight volunteers. In 2006, the library purchased a 
computer-based library system, ResourceMate. One of the attractions of the system is its 
modest cost and surprising capabilities. The software allows the user to go to the Library </p>

</p>
<p>of Congress catalog, find the desired record, and import the MARC record into the local 
database. The program inserts the data in the proper fields and allows for importing of 
MARC data from a number of other libraries. The electronic capabilities make the lim-
ited amount of staff time much more productive for verification and cataloging work. 
</p>
<p> Verification, the first step in the acquisitions procedure, is perhaps the most in-
teresting and challenging duty in this department. The attempt to establish an item&Ecirc;s 
existence when there is very little information is similar to detective work. 
</p>
<p> Ordering 
</p>
<p> Today, most libraries use computer-generated orders and store the data electroni-
cally, thus reducing the volume of paper associated with ordering activities. A few 
libraries generate no paper order form for current trade books and handle the entire 
order process electronically, storing the transaction in both the library&Ecirc;s and the sup-
plier&Ecirc;s computers. In the future, this may be the way all libraries place their orders; 
however, for thousands of libraries, the paperless order is not yet a reality. 
</p>
<p> Some years ago vendors and libraries agreed upon a set of guidelines for plac-
ing orders. ( Guidelines for Handling Library Orders for In-Print Monographic Publi-
cations,  2nd ed. [Chicago: American Library Association, 1984]. Although no longer 
listed by ALA as an active guideline, almost all libraries implemented its key elements.) 
One suggestion is that libraries use the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
Committee Z39 single-title order form, which measures 3 &times; 5 inches (about 8 &times; 13 
centimeters), a size that has been common for years in technical services units. 
</p>
<p> Regardless of the method used to order material, the vendor must receive enough 
information to ensure shipment of the proper item: author, title, publisher, date of pub-
lication, price, edition (if there are various editions), number of copies, order number, 
and any special instructions regarding invoicing or methods of payment. Also, more 
suppliers are asking for the ISBN or ISSN. In time, International Standard Numbers 
(ISNs) may be all the library needs to send, because ISNs are unique numbers repre-
senting a specific journal or a specific edition of a specific title. Other uses of these 
numbers are in cataloging, data processing, and public service activities, so it is im-
portant to understand ISBNs and how they work. 
</p>
<p> One important characteristic of ISBNs is that there is a unique ISBN for each edi-
tion of a book and for paper and hardbound versions. For example, the number for the 
first edition of this book was 0-87287-029-4; the second edition was 0-87287-125-8. 
The number for the hardbound version of the seventh edition was 1-56308-918-1 and 
the paper edition was, 1-56308-922-X. The number(s) before the first hyphen repre-
sents the country of origin; the second set of numbers is for the individual publisher; 
the third set represents the title, edition, and format; and the last number is a &bdquo;check 
digit.&permil; Recently, a three-digit prefix has been added&middot;either 978 or 979. The ISSN is 
an eight-digit number that identifies the publisher and title for periodicals. As with the 
ISBN, the last digit serves as the control. The ISBNs and ISSNs were both developed 
in the expectation of extensive computer use in book distribution. 
</p>
<p> From the point of view of some acquisitions departments, the ISBN is the  only 
 information needed to order a book from a jobber because it identifies the specific 
edition and binding. Ordering by ISBN could be a major time-saver: no more keying </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>92 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview
</p>
<p>in of author, title, publisher, place, date, or price. However, mistakes might arise from 
just using the ISBN (e.g., transposed numbers, errors in copying). If the library pro-
vides author, title, and publisher, for example, the jobber may be able to provide the 
desired item despite a typographic error. Nevertheless, serious consideration should 
be given to using only the ISBN. 
</p>
<p> The ISBN is one of several ways to search for bibliographic data in an electronic 
environment. When one is searching hundreds of titles a day, saving 10 to 20 seconds 
per search is important. 
</p>
<p> Acquisitions department staff need to realize that because the ISBN  is  unique, it 
should only be used in conjunction with other search techniques to verify information 
about a title, not to determine if the library already has a copy of a particular book. A 
reprint of a particular title will have a different ISBN than the original; perhaps the 
requester does not know that the library already has the originally published edition. 
Further, if a book is published simultaneously in the United States and in Europe, 
each edition will have its own ISBN. Acquisitions department staff should be very 
careful that one person isn&Ecirc;t ordering a particular book using the U.S. ISBN when 
another has just ordered the same title using the British or Canadian ISBN. 
</p>
<p> An article by Audrey Eaglen outlined other issues related to using ISBNs. Though 
Eaglen was writing in 1989, those same issues are still problems today. First, she noted 
that publishers sometimes use the number for inventory control, getting a new number 
for each reprinting of the title and using the number to track the number of copies sold 
from that print run. Second, publishers often only give part of the ISBN, usually the 
third element (title/edition) in their ads and promotional literature. A third problem 
she noted is that review media, when they include ISBNs, often do not list the correct 
number. She stated that, &bdquo;Approximately ten percent of the ISBNs given in its ( PW    ) 
&Acirc;Forecasts&Ecirc; reviews are simply incorrect.&permil; 4  These problems, combined with the fact 
that a book published in both cloth and paperback formats by different publishers in 
the United States and the United Kingdom can have four different ISBNs, illustrate the 
limitations of the system. 
</p>
<p> Another standard of ANSI Committee Z39 is the SAN. Like the ISBN, the SAN 
is a unique seven-digit number that identifies each address or organization doing busi-
ness in the U.S. and Canadian book trade. For example, the SAN of the Loyola Mary-
mount University&Ecirc;s library is 332-9135, Brodart is 159-9984, Libraries Unlimited is 
202-6767, and Thomas Allen &amp; Son is 115-1762. Perhaps eventually all that will be 
necessary to order a title electronically will be three sets of unique numbers: the ISBN 
or ISSN and the SANs for the supplier and the buyer. Keys to SANs appear in a variety 
of sources, such as the  American Library Directory,  which includes library SANs in 
its entries.

<p> Reporting 
</p>
<p> We mentioned speed of acquisitions as one measure users take into consideration 
when judging library quality, assuming they are allowed to submit requests. It is true 
that some of the desired titles may be available at local bookstores, but most are not. 
Also, when there is a special reason for doing so, a staff member can go to the store 
to purchase the title. (In the past, when there was a true independent bookstore with 
a strong stock, some libraries used bookstores as their primary jobber. It helped the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>General Procedures 93
</p>
<p>local economy and generally led to faster delivery of desired titles. Today there few 
such stores&Ecirc; most bookstores are part of national chains that tend to focus on titles 
appealing to the mass market.) 
</p>
<p> Typically a 30-day window for delivery is standard for vendors, after which the 
library may reasonably start a claiming process. Paul Orkiszewski did a comparative 
study of Amazon.com and a library vendor and found that Amazon&Ecirc;s average deliv-
ery time was two weeks while the major vendor&Ecirc;s average was four weeks. 5  However, 
Amazon&Ecirc;s cancellation rate was more than twice that of the vendor; further, of the 5,134 
titles in the study sample, 327 were not available for ordering through Amazon. (We 
discuss Amazon and the above study in the next chapter.) 
</p>
<p> Vendors are supposed to report the status of titles not yet delivered upon receipt of 
a claim. Most integrated library system acquisitions modules have the ability to gener-
ate claim forms based on the order date and the expected delivery that the department 
establishes. Vendors should respond with a meaningful report within a reasonable pe-
riod. One less than helpful report that vendors occasionally use is &bdquo;temporarily out 
of stock.&permil; How long is &bdquo;temporarily&permil;? What has the vendor done to secure the item? 
Poor or inaccurate reporting costs the library money, as Audrey Eaglen pointed out 
in &bdquo;Trouble in Kiddyland: The Hidden Costs of O.P. and O.S.&permil; 6  In periods of rapid 
inflation, each day a library&Ecirc;s funds remain committed but unexpended erodes buy-
ing power because producers and suppliers may raise prices without notice. Recom-
mended status descriptions on vendor reports are &bdquo;not yet received from publisher&permil;; 
&bdquo;out-of-stock, ordering&permil;; &bdquo;claiming&permil;; &bdquo;canceled&permil;; &bdquo;not yet published&permil;; &bdquo;out-of-stock, 
publisher&permil;; &bdquo;out-of-print&permil;; &bdquo;publication canceled&permil;; &bdquo;out-of-stock indefinitely&permil; (treat 
this one as a cancellation); &bdquo;not our publication&permil; (NOP); &bdquo;wrong title supplied&permil;; &bdquo;de-
fective copy&permil;; and &bdquo;wrong quantity supplied.&permil; After staff members learn how long, on 
average, a vendor takes to supply titles reported in one of the recommended catego-
ries, it is possible to make informed decisions regarding when to cancel and when to 
wait for delivery. 
</p>
<p> When dealing with U.S. publishers, allowing for the normal snail-mail time, it is 
reasonable to send a second claim 60 days after the first claim, if there has been no 
status report. Many order forms carry a statement reading &bdquo;cancel after  x  days.&permil; Al-
though such statements are legally binding, most libraries send a separate cancellation 
notice. (Note: The order slip is in fact a legal contract committing the library to pay for 
the item upon delivery.) Cancellation should not take place until after the normal re-
sponse time passes, unless there are unusual circumstances. The most common occur-
rence is unexpected budget cuts; unfortunately, such cuts occur with some frequency. 
Most vendors are cooperative about making the adjustments. By establishing a regular 
cancellation date, libraries that must expend funds within a period of time (usually 
12 months) can avoid or reduce the last-minute scramble of canceling outstanding 
orders and ordering materials that the vendor can deliver in time to expend the funds. 
(Budgets, timeframes, accounting, and expenditures are explored in greater detail in 
chapter 12.) 
</p>
<p> Before placing an order, the staff must make three important decisions: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Which acquisition method to use. 
 &bull; What vendor to use. 
 &bull; What funding source to use. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>94 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview
</p>
<p> Receiving Orders 
</p>
<p> When the boxes of ordered items arrive the department has a receiving process 
that must be followed if the library is to satisfy accountability requirements and en-
sure that funds are effectively spent. 
</p>
<p> The process commences with careful unpacking. Shipments arrive with a pack-
ing slip that should reflect every item in the shipment. A shipment may be one box or 
dozens; no matter how many boxes there are, there will be only one packing slip for 
the entire shipment. In a large library, there may be several shipments each day from 
different vendors or even the same vendor who sent an order in two shipments. It is 
very important to keep each shipment separated from the others as not doing so will 
make the following steps more complex than need be. 
</p>
<p> Step two is finding the packing slip for each shipment. Generally, this is easy as 
the shipper has attached a plastic envelope marked &bdquo;packing slip&permil; to one of the boxes, 
but that is not always the case. Sometimes the packing list is inside a box, even in the 
bottom of a box under a cardboard liner. Why all the bother about a packing slip? The 
slip is supposed to accurately reflect all the items in a shipment, which the vast majority 
of the time it does. However, when it does not match there could be problems between 
the vendor and library over completion of an order. Typical issues are an item is listed 
as part of the shipment but isn&Ecirc;t there or items are in the shipment that were not ordered. 
(Note: It is useful to have available a copy of the order during the checking process.) 
Another common issue is too many or too few copies of an ordered title were shipped; 
again having the original order provides the correct information. (You can imagine the 
complexity of this seemingly simple activity if multiple shipments are intermixed.) 
Normally the packing slip will indicate if it is partial or complete order fulfillment. 
Some libraries also do a quick check of books to identify any obvious defects&middot;missing 
or blank pages, or upside down text for example. Unfortunately, security is also an 
issue. When the material arrives there is no indication of who owns the item (almost 
all libraries &bdquo;property mark&permil; items in their collections). Commercial outlets refer to 
&bdquo;shrinkage&permil;&middot;items that go missing&middot;for libraries there is shrinkage both before and 
after items are added to the collections. The time between unpacking and property 
marking is a vulnerable period. Often there is insufficient time to fully process all of a 
day&Ecirc;s shipments; leaving the material exposed is an invitation for some people to take 
something. The danger is particularly true for approval items (see later sections) when 
items remain, unmarked, in a location where selectors can look through the items  be-
fore  the library decides to acquire the title. Vendors are usually very accommodating 
about shipment errors, budget problems, defective copies, and so on, but generally are 
not willing to accept a title for return that has been &bdquo;stamped, folded, stapled, and mu-
tilated&permil; as someone once referred to library property-marking activities. Media such as 
DVDs and audio recordings seem to be particularly prone to shrinkage. 
</p>
<p> The remainder of this chapter explores the methods of acquiring materials. Chap-
ter 6 discusses vendors: when and how to use them and what to expect from them. 
Chapter 12 covers the fiscal side of acquisitions work. 
</p>
<p> ACQUISITION METHODS 
</p>
<p> Essentially, there are eight standard methods of acquisition&middot;firm order, stand-
ing order, approval plans, blanket order, subscriptions (for serials departments), leases, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Acquisition Methods 95
</p>
<p>gifts, and exchange programs. A  firm order  (orders in which desired items are indi-
vidually named) is the usual method for titles that the library  knows  it wants. For most 
current items, a firm order is the only logical method to use. It is often the best method 
for the first volume in a series, even if the selectors believe they are likely to order the 
entire series. While it is possible to order directly from the producers, doing so takes 
substantially more time than placing an order for a number of titles from different 
producers with a jobber/wholesaler. The major drawback of this method is the time it 
takes to prepare the individual orders. 
</p>
<p>  Standing orders  (an open order for all titles fitting a particular category) are best 
for items that are serial in character and the library is confident it wants all the publi-
cations as they appear. Some examples are a numbered or unnumbered series from a 
publisher that deal with a single subject area. Another broad category is the irregular 
publications of a professional society&middot;memoirs and special commemorative volumes, 
for example. The library places the order for the series or items rather like it places a 
journal subscription. The supplier (vendor or producer) automatically sends the items 
as they appear along with an invoice. There is a distinction between &bdquo;thinking about&permil; 
and &bdquo;planning on&permil; when considering series items. When the selector knows that the 
reputation of the publisher or editor of the series is sound, it is probably best to place 
a standing order.  If  the library knows it wants all the items, then a standing order will 
save staff time and effort due to the automatic shipments. However, especially in aca-
demic libraries, standing orders are often the result of a faculty member&Ecirc;s request, and if 
the library does not periodically review its standing orders it may find that the requester 
left the institution years before or there is no longer an interest in the series&Ecirc; subject. 
The result is money spent on less useful items. If there is some question about suitabil-
ity or content of the series, a firm order or approval copy order for the first volume is 
the better choice. Not all publisher&Ecirc;s series are in fact quality titles, and in some cases 
they are almost, if not in fact, fraudulent. For example, in 1993 there were a number 
of e-mail messages on one of the collection development discussion lists regarding an 
article in  Lingua Franca  about a publisher that appeared to be a vanity house but that 
marketed books as part of a series. 7  (A vanity publisher simply prints any person&Ecirc;s book 
as long as the individual pays all of the production costs.) Getting to know publishers 
and editors is an important activity for acquisitions department staff. 
</p>
<p> The greatest drawback to standing orders is their unpredictable nature in terms of 
numbers and cost. Certainly, there is no problem about numbers for the regular series, 
but their cost per item may vary. When it comes to publishers&Ecirc; series or irregular se-
ries, a library may go years without receiving a title, then receive several in one year. 
This is one of the areas where Joyce Ogburn&Ecirc;s prediction skills come into play, as one 
must guesstimate how much money to set aside at the start of the budget year to cover 
standing order expenses. 8  Looking at past experience and using an average amount 
is a safe approach; however, the library is seldom able to set aside exactly the right 
amount. Committing (encumbering) too much money for too long may result in lost 
opportunities to acquire other useful items. Committing too little can result in not hav-
ing the funds available to pay invoices when they arrive. Standing orders are a valuable 
acquisition method, but one that requires careful monitoring throughout the year. 
</p>
<p>  Approval plans  are, in a sense, a variation of the standing order concept. They 
involve automatic shipment of items to the library from a vendor along with auto-
matic invoicing, after the library accepts the item. The differences are that the approval 
plan normally covers a number of subject areas and the library has the right to return </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>96 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview
</p>
<p>titles it does not want. Approval plans can save staff time and effort when properly 
implemented. They can also be costly when not thoughtfully established and carefully 
monitored. Another advantage is the right to return unwanted items; the underlying 
assumption is that collection development staff can make better decisions about an 
item&Ecirc;s appropriateness by looking at the item before committing to its purchase. How-
ever, there is research evidence that indicates the approval plan can result in a substan-
tially higher number of very low or no-use items being added to the collection. 9  
</p>
<p> The key element in making the approval plan a cost-effective acquisition method 
is creating a sound profile with the plan vendor. A profile outlines the parameters of the 
plan and covers issues such as subjects desired, levels of treatment (e.g., undergradu-
ate, graduate), languages/countries coverage, no reprints, no collections of reprinted 
articles, and so forth. The more time devoted to defining the profile, as well as monitor-
ing the actual operation of the plan and making adjustments, the greater the value of 
an approval plan to the library and the acquisitions department. Monitoring operations 
and actually reviewing the item are also obvious keys to success. Given the staffing 
situation in most libraries, there is a real danger that the plan will shift from approval 
to blanket order, simply because the staff has to attend to many pressing duties, leaving 
them little time for the task of reviewing approval titles. 
</p>
<p> A  blanket order  is a combination of a firm order and an approval plan. It is a com-
mitment on the library&Ecirc;s part to purchase all of something, usually the output of a pub-
lisher, or items in a limited subject area, or items from a particular country. In the case 
of a subject area or country, there is a profile developed between the library and the 
blanket-order vendor. The materials arrive automatically along with the invoice, thus 
saving staff time. Another advantage, for country blanket order plans, is that they en-
sure that the library acquires a copy of limited print runs. (It is not uncommon to have 
very limited print runs of scholarly items in many countries. If the library waits for an 
announcement or a listing in a national bibliography before ordering, there may be no 
copies available to purchase.) Like the standing order, the major drawback of blanket-
order plans is predicting how much money the library will need to reserve to cover the 
invoices. There is even less predictability with blanket-order plans because there are 
more variables. 
</p>
<p>  Subscriptions,  for journals, newspapers, and many other serials, are a combina-
tion of standing and blanket orders. A library may enter a subscription for a given time 
frame just as an individual does for personal magazines. However, rather than going 
through an annual renewal process, many libraries enter into an agreement with a seri-
als vendor to automatically renew subscriptions until the library requests a cancella-
tion (called &bdquo;   &Ecirc;til forbidden orders&permil;). This saves the library and vendor staff time and 
paperwork and is a cost-effective system for titles the library is  certain  are of long-
term interest to end-users. 
</p>
<p>  Leases  are now commonplace for handling electronic resources, especially those 
that are Web based. The decision to lease is almost always in the hands of the sup-
plier rather than the library, although sometimes a library can buy the product, usually 
at a substantially higher price. The difference between buying and leasing has signifi-
cant implications for the library and its users. In short, the library pays for  access  to 
the information for as long as it pays the annual fee. At the end of a lease the library 
generally loses all access to the material it was paying for, although some suppliers 
will provide long-term access to the material that was available during the lease period. </p>

<p>Chapters 7 and 8 provide more information about this and other issues related to elec-
tronic resources. 
</p>
<p> Frequently, the acquisitions department is the library&Ecirc;s designated recipient of un-
solicited  gifts  of books, serials, and other materials (sometimes accompanied by a va-
riety of molds and insects) that well-meaning people give to the library. Solicited and 
unsolicited gifts can be a source of important out-of-print materials for replacement, 
extra copies, and the filling of gaps in the collection. The collection-development pol-
icy statement on gifts will help acquisitions personnel process the material quickly. A 
good article outlining all aspects of handling gifts is Mary Bostic&Ecirc;s &bdquo;Gifts to Libraries: 
Coping Effectively.&permil; 10  Another excellent survey of both gift and exchange programs is 
by Steven Carrico; it covers all management aspects of the work. 11  
</p>
<p> Reviewing gifts is important, as a library cannot afford to discard valuable or needed 
items that arrive as gifts. However, the library must keep in mind the fact that it should 
not add unnecessary items just because they were free. Processing and storage costs are 
the same for a gift as for a purchased item. Older books require careful checking, as 
variations in printings and editions may determine whether an item is valuable or worth-
less. (Usually, a second or third printing is less valuable than the first printing of a work.) 
Persons with extensive training and experience in bibliographic checking must do the 
searching. 
</p>
<p> Steven Carrico provides an excellent summary of the advantages and disadvan-
tages of gift programs: 
</p>
<p> Positive Points of Gifts 
</p>
<p>  1. Gifts can replace worn and missing items in a library. 
  2. Out-of-print desiderata often surface from gift donations. 
  3. Gifts can foster communication and goodwill in a library community. 
  4. Gifts may become heavily used or important research additions to a 
</p>
<p>collection. 
  5. Some titles that are not available by purchase are available as gifts. 
  6. Worthwhile gift material not selected for a library collection can be put 
</p>
<p>in a book sale, sold to dealers, or given away to underfunded libraries and 
institutions. 
</p>
<p> Negative Points 
</p>
<p>  1. Gifts require staff time and are costly to process. 
  2. Dealing with even well meaning gift donors is frequently an aggravation 
</p>
<p>to staff. 
  3. Gifts take up precious space in a library. 
  4. Many collection managers give gifts low priority, so they may sit on re-
</p>
<p>view shelves for a long time. 
  5. A large percentage of most gifts are not added to a collection, which cre-
</p>
<p>ates disposal problems. 
  6. Overall, since most gift books added to a collection are older editions, 
</p>
<p>they will be less frequently used by library patrons. 12  
</p>
<p> There are some legal aspects about gifts, at least in the United States, that staff 
must understand. One Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation relevant to libraries </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>98 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview
</p>
<p>has to do with gifts and donations to a library or a not-for-profit information center. 
Any library, or its parent institution, that receives a gift in-kind (books, journals, 
manuscripts, and so forth) with an appraised value of $5,000 or more must report 
the gift to the IRS. A second regulation forbids the receiving party (in this case the 
library) from providing an estimated value for the gift in-kind. A disinterested party 
or organization must make the valuation. The latter requirement grew out of concern 
that recipients were placing unrealistically high values on gifts. The donor received a 
larger tax deduction than was warranted, and it did not cost the receiving organization 
anything to place a high value on the gift. Normally, an appraiser charges a fee for 
valuing gifts, and the donor is supposed to pay the fee. Most often, the appraisers are 
antiquarian dealers who charge a flat fee for the service unless the collection is large 
or complex. If the appraisal is complex, the appraiser either charges a percentage of 
the appraised value or an hourly fee. 
</p>
<p> Typically, with gifts thought to be worth less than $4,999, the library may write a 
letter of acknowledgment indicating the number and type of items received. For gifts 
of less than $250, the IRS does not require a letter. The donor can set a value on the 
gift for tax purposes. (The best practice is to provide a letter for any accepted gift.) 
If asked, the library can provide dealer catalogs for the donors to see retail prices for 
items similar to their donation. However, the final value of the gift is established by 
the donor and his tax accountant. 
</p>
<p> To meet IRS requirements, a letter must contain the library&Ecirc;s name, the date of 
the contribution, the location/place of the gift (even if it is the library), and a descrip-
tion of the gift. At a minimum that description should provide number and kind of 
gift (for example, 100 mass-market paperbacks, 40 hardcover books, six complete 
and unbound volumes of  National Geographic ). More information regarding these 
regulations can be found in the IRS publications  Charitable Contributions  (IRS Pub-
lication No. 526) and  Charitable Contributions&middot;Substantiation and Disclosure  (IRS 
Publication No. 1771). Both are available online at http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/
index.html. 
</p>
<p> Donations and gifts also present an acquisitions option that can be appropriate at 
times. Sometimes a library user or board member donates personal books or magazines 
on a regular basis, making it unnecessary to order the item if there is no immediate de-
mand for the material. Occasionally, an appropriate series or set costs so much a library 
cannot buy it with regular funding sources. Seeking a donor to assist with funding or 
to pay for the purchase is not unheard of, but again, there may be substantial delays in 
acquiring the item. Most often, this takes place with rare books and special collections 
items. An active (and well-to-do) Friends of the Library group may be the answer to a 
special purchase situation. Friends groups, used judiciously, can significantly expand 
the collection and stretch funds. 
</p>
<p> Deciding to use the gift method of acquisition will almost always result in a long 
delay in receiving the desired item. This is also true of the deposit method of acquisi-
tion. Verification may establish that an item is a government publication that may be 
part of the library&Ecirc;s depository program, or it may be a new government series that is 
expected to become part of the program. In either case, the acquisitions staff would not 
issue a firm order but would notify the requester so that she can decide what to do. 
</p>
<p> The final acquisition category is the  exchange  method. There are two basic types 
of exchange activity: the exchange of unwanted duplicate or gift materials and the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Acquisition Methods 99
</p>
<p>exchange of new materials between libraries. Usually, only large research libraries en-
gage in exchange of new materials. In essence, cooperating institutions trade institutional 
publications. Tozzer Library (Harvard University&Ecirc;s anthropology library) has exchange 
agreements with several hundred organizations. These organizations send their publica-
tions to Tozzer, which, in turn, sends them Peabody Museum publications. Often, this 
method is the only way a library can acquire an organization&Ecirc;s publications, especially 
from countries with a developing book trade. 
</p>
<p> Occasionally, libraries use this system to acquire materials from countries in which 
there are commercial trade restrictions. Where government trade restrictions make buy-
ing and selling of publications from certain countries difficult or impossible, the coop-
erating libraries acquire (buy) their local publications for exchange. Exchanges of this 
type are complex and difficult to manage, and this is a method of last resort. Libraries 
can exercise better quality control when they trade for known organizational series or 
titles than when the choice of publications from the organization is more or less left 
to chance. Exchanges of this type exist on the basis of formal agreements between the 
cooperating organizations. They play an important role in developing comprehensive 
subject collections. 
</p>
<p> The Canadian Book Exchange Centre (CBEC), a service operated by the Library 
and Archives Canada, is a redistribution center and a clearinghouse for the exchange 
of materials in all formats between libraries. The service is free, although participat-
ing libraries must pay shipping charges. Individuals can donate items to the centre 
but cannot receive items in exchange. Details about CBEC&Ecirc;s activities can be found at 
www.nlc-bnc.ca/6/10/index-e.html. 
</p>
<p> Libraries normally add only a small percentage of unsolicited gifts to the collec-
tion. This means the library must dispose of many unwanted items. In some libraries, 
a separate unit, usually is called the exchange department, handles unneeded material. 
In most cases, the gift unit handles the disposal work. 
</p>
<p> Disposition of unwanted gift materials is an activity that almost every library en-
gages in at some time. One method is to list the unwanted items and mail the list to 
exchange units in other libraries, and the first library to request an item gets it for the 
shipping cost (usually media rate postage). This method is time-consuming and takes 
up scarce shelf space in many libraries. Another method is to arrange with an out-of-
print dealer to take the items, usually as a lot rather than for a per-item price. It is un-
usual to receive cash, however; instead, the dealer gives the library a line of credit. The 
library then uses the credit to acquire materials from the dealer. This system works well 
when the library has specialized materials the dealer wants and when the dealer stocks 
enough useful material so that the library can use its credit within a reasonable time 
(18 to 24 months). 
</p>
<p> Holding a book sale is yet another method of disposing of unwanted material, one 
that is gaining in popularity as dealers resist the credit-memo system. However, this 
is not a free venture, as staff must select the items for sale, establish a fair price, find 
a suitable location, and monitor the sale. Depending on the volume of gifts, annual, 
semiannual, or monthly sales are appropriate. Sales can be an excellent Friends of the 
Library project that can save some staff time. A few libraries use an ongoing sale tac-
tic, especially when they have limited staff and space and a high volume of unwanted 
gifts. There is a Web site devoted to listing book sales in the United States, including 
library book sales (http://www.book-sales-in-america.com). </p>

</p>
<p> SERIALS PROCESSING 
</p>
<p> Users and librarians often want to know the library&Ecirc;s exact holdings for a journal 
or magazine. Are some issues missing? What is the latest issue? When did the library 
last pay for the subscription? How often does the library bind the issues? What is the 
publication&Ecirc;s format? Where can the library subscribe to a particular periodical? The 
ILS serials software can easily supply such information and can even display the lat-
est issue received information in the OPAC, but without careful data entry much of 
the software&Ecirc;s capability is lost. 
</p>
<p> Most librarians agree that serials control constitutes one of the major record-
keeping headaches in technical services. The basic method is to employ a control 
record for each title. This can be a page in a notebook, a 3- &times; 5-inch (about 8- &times; 13-
centimeter) card file, a card in a visible file (see Figures 5.4 and 5.5), or a computer 
record. A single record should contain all information for a given title, such as when 
the subscription began, its acquisition source, renewal frequency, and binding infor-
mation.

<p> SUMMARY

<p> Acquisition work is detail oriented and moderately complex; it is also interesting 
and challenging at times. It calls for knowledge of information producers. It also in-
volves a number of legal issues, for example, a firm order slip is a contract, electronic 
products come with contracts and lease forms, and even gifts may have legal implica-
tions. Technology helps acquisitions staff members keep up with an ever-increasing 
volume of work; however, it is still the individuals who take the time to really under-
stand the information trade that make the process work as well as it does.

<p>6    Distributors and Vendors 
</p>
<p> Vendors are liaisons among content providers, the vendor, and librarians&middot;a 
task that requires diplomacy as well as solid communications skills. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Carol Tenopir, 2005 
</p>
<p> During my regular work day, I spend a lot of time contacting vendors to resolve 
problems, claim missing serial issues, order replacements, set up new standing 
orders and subscriptions, obtain price quotes, sort out billing questions, and 
track down problems with online access. No two vendor customer service op-
erations are alike and many of them are slowly driving me up a wall. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Anne Myers, 2009 
</p>
<p> &bdquo;Select the vendor,&permil; is a simple phrase that belies the complexity and importance 
to a library&Ecirc;s quality of service and, in part, its financial condition. Without the assis-
tance of vendors and distributors, libraries would need to vastly increase technical 
services staffing to handle the increased workload. Or they simply would not be able 
to make available all the resources they currently offer because the existing staff would 
be overloaded with work. As the Tenopir epigraph states, vendors are in the middle 
between content creators and providers and the library. They provide a consolidation 
point for acquisitions work. They offer services that are substantially lower in cost than 
what the library could and often offer services requiring skills that do not exist among 
the library staff. 
</p>
<p> All units in technical services use some form outsourcing (binding of materials for 
example) or vendor services (purchasing books for example). Vendors come in a vari-
ety of forms&middot;for-profit (subscription agencies and retail outlets are two such types) 
and nonprofit (consortia and Library of Congress are examples). Most libraries use one 
or more vendors of each type. In terms of acquisitions work, some vendors are broad </p>

</div>

</p>
<p>based (offering a variety of formats, books, audio recordings, and videorecordings) 
while others are highly specialized such as scientific, technical, and medical (STM) 
firms. One advantage of using a vendor for purchasing collection items is that one order 
to a vendor can supply material from a variety of producers. There is a trade-off, how-
ever, between one-stop shopping convenience and the possibility of receiving a larger 
discount by going directly to the producer. Thus, in making that simple act of selecting 
the vendor, the staff must understand what vendor is the best choice for the particular 
need and whether it would be more advantageous to deal directly with the producer. 
</p>
<p> MAKING THE SELECTION&mdash;FACTORS TO CONSIDER 
</p>
<p> Much of the following applies to almost all vendors that a library might go to for 
a product or service. The following material focuses on vendors who support the li-
brary&Ecirc;s acquisition functions. Six broad categories usually come into play in making a 
selection: what is commonly carried (normal stock), the firm&Ecirc;s technological capability, 
how quickly the firm is likely to deliver materials (order fulfillment), the firm&Ecirc;s financial 
condition and discounts offered, the range of services available, and customer service. It 
is essential to remember that in most instances there will be a contract, with all the le-
galities that entails, once a choice is made. The contract will specify all the terms and 
conditions, many of which could have serious financial consequences for the library 
should the library wish to cancel or otherwise modify the agreement. 
</p>
<p> What the Firm Stocks 
</p>
<p> When looking for a source for collection items a key concern is what the com-
pany usually carries in stock. Vendors&Ecirc; Web sites often claim &bdquo;Over xxx million items in 
our warehouse&permil; or something very similar. That is not useful information; it could mean 
there are many copies of a few thousand titles. What is useful is having a list of all the 
producers and publishers the firm regularly carries in its warehouses and what series, 
producers, and publishers they do  not  carry&middot;such a list may be surprisingly long 
and have unexpected names. What are the vendor&Ecirc;s specialties, if any? For example, 
Baker &amp; Taylor specializes in public and school library markets while Midwest Library 
Service&Ecirc;s primary focus is academic libraries. Sales representatives often say the firm 
can supply  any  title from  any  publisher, with only minor exceptions. While it may be 
possible for a general (primarily mass-market titles) book supplier to secure STM ti-
tles, the delays in delivery may be excessive. Knowing which publishers the vendor 
does not handle helps maintain good working relations in the long run, although secur-
ing that information may prove to be challenging. 
</p>
<p> Vendor Technological Capability 
</p>
<p> In this category, probably the key question is, does the firm&Ecirc;s system have an in-
terface that will work effectively with the library&Ecirc;s integrated library system (ILS)? If 
the answer is yes, may the library have a free test period to determine those capabili-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Making the Selection&mdash;Factors to Consider 107
</p>
<p>ties prior to signing a contract? Other technology concerns include whether the firm of-
fers free online preorder checking, electronic ordering, invoicing, payments, claiming, 
technology support/troubleshooting, and hours of availability. Today the technological 
issues are almost as important as the firm&Ecirc;s stock. 
</p>
<p> Speed of Delivery 
</p>
<p> As mentioned several times, speed of fulfillment of requests is one measure by 
which the user community judges the quality of service. Thus, it is not surprising that 
vendor speed of fulfillment is a factor in making a final decision about which vendor 
to employ. Information about the average delivery time from the vendor ought to be 
cross-checked with some of the vendor&Ecirc;s current customers. (There should be no hesi-
tation on the vendor&Ecirc;s part in supplying a list of current customers. It also often pays to 
contact customers not on the list as a further cross-check.) 
</p>
<p> Many ILS systems are capable of producing a report similar to the one shown in 
the Vendor Performance Statistics chart. Thus, libraries can reasonably quickly tell you 
what their actual experience with the firm has been.

</p>
<p> Each row in the report represents a firm that a hypothetical library uses to secure its 
collection material. This type of report capability is highly useful for evaluating vendor 
performance (more about this activity later in this chapter). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>108 6&mdash;Distributors and Vendors
</p>
<p> Many vendors promise 24-hour shipment of items in stock. Do they make good 
on such claims? Generally, yes; however, the key phrase is  in stock.  Frequently, there 
can be delays of three to four months in receiving a complete order because one or 
more titles are not in stock. For the library and the vendor, such delays are problem-
atic. Generally, the acquisitions department cannot authorize payment for anything less 
than a completed order. A delay of several months beyond the normal lag time in 
payment (see later in the chapter) can cause a financial burden for the vendor. One way 
around the issue is to cancel those items that will take extra time to deliver (so the cur-
rent order is then completed) and reorder them when they are in stock. That approach 
is time consuming for the library. Addressing such issues prior to signing a contract is 
in everyone&Ecirc;s best interest. 
</p>
<p> Financial Considerations 
</p>
<p> There is more to consider in this category than what, if any, the discount may 
be; however, the discount rate is a topic acquisitions departments frequently discuss 
when they get together. Certainly, the discount rate is important, but what is equally 
important is to what percentage of the items that discount rate applies and whether 
there are classes of material that carry service charges rather than a discount. There is 
also the possibility the rate will be dependent upon the contracted dollar amount spent 
with the firm within a specified period (the greater the amount spent, the higher the 
discount). 
</p>
<p> Discounting, especially in the book trade is something of a maze. The discount 
the library may receive is dependent upon the discount the vendor receives from the 
producers or publishers. Because vendors buy in volume, they receive a substantial dis-
count from producers. When they sell a copy of the highly discounted title to the library, 
the library receives a discount off the producer&Ecirc;s list price. However, that is substantially 
lower than the discount the vendor received. Clearly, there must be a profit margin for 
the firm to stay in business. For example, if the vendor received a 40 percent discount 
from the producer, the discount given the library will be 15 to 20 percent. If the library 
ordered the title directly from the producer, there is a slight chance the discount may be 
about the same level (10 to 20 percent). The advantage for the library of going with a 
vendor rather than with the producer directly comes about from staff savings. That is, 
being able to send the vendor one order for titles from dozens of producers rather than 
creating dozens of orders for each producer. 
</p>
<p> Book-trade discounting is particularly complex. Every publisher&Ecirc;s discount sched-
ule is slightly different, if not unique. Some items are  net  (no discount); usually these 
are textbooks, STM titles, or items of limited sales appeal.  Short discounts  are nor-
mally 20 percent; these are items the producers expect will have limited appeal but that 
have more potential than the net titles.  Trade discounts  range from 30 to 60 percent or 
more; items in this category are high-demand items or high-risk popular fiction such 
as first time authors. Publishers believe that by giving a high discount for fiction, book-
stores will stock more copies and thus help promote the title. Vendors normally receive 
40 to 50 percent discounts, primarily because of their high-volume orders (hundreds 
of copies per title rather than the tens that most libraries and independent bookstore 
owners order). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Making the Selection&mdash;Factors to Consider 109
</p>
<p> One important financial issue is how the firm handles invoicing, especially how 
long the library has to make the payment without incurring a late charge. For most li-
braries anything less than 60 days will pose a serious problem. Very few libraries have 
authority to issue a payment; what they have is the authority to indicate to the parent 
institution&Ecirc;s (city, school district, academic institution, or company) business office that 
the invoice should be paid. The process of moving the invoice through the system and 
getting the check or voucher drawn up and in the hands of the vendor almost always 
takes more than 30 days. An occasional rush payment is usually possible, but the occa-
sions must be few and far between not the norm. For smaller vendors the time lag 
may be more than it can handle on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p> Some vendors will order a single title from a publisher when it is not in stock in 
order to fulfill the order in a timely manner. Others, however, may wait until they have 
received multiple requests for the item before placing the order. By placing a multiple-
copy order, the vendor receives a higher discount. It may take several months before 
the vendor accumulates enough requests to generate the discount level it believes makes 
the transaction profitable. The impact of this practice may or may not be serious de-
pending on where the library is in its budget cycle and inflation rates. Some vendors 
will place a single-copy order, but at a much lower discount than the library&Ecirc;s usual 
discount or impose a service charge. 
</p>
<p> Another financial concern is with the firm&Ecirc;s financial stability. Like everyone else 
vendors have encountered financial problems during the current recession. Some pub-
lishers are requiring prepayment or have placed vendors on a pro forma status. Pro 
forma status requires prepayment, and suppliers extend credit on the basis of the current 
performance in payment of bills. Much of the credit and order fulfillment extended by 
publishers depends on an almost personal relationship with the buyer. That in turn af-
fects the vendor&Ecirc;s ability to fulfill orders as quickly as it did in the past. Thus, libraries 
must select a vendor with care. It is not inappropriate to check a prospective vendor&Ecirc;s 
financial status (through a rating service, such as Dun and Bradstreet). 
</p>
<p> Vendors&rsquo; Services 
</p>
<p> Many major vendors offer a variety of services that go beyond supplying items for 
the collection. They offer almost one-stop technical services, from preorder checking to 
cataloging to shelf-ready (processed) material. 
</p>
<p> Some of the larger U.S. library book vendors are Baker &amp; Taylor, Brodart, Follett, 
Blackwell North America, and Midwest Library Service. Two large Canadian book 
wholesalers are National Book Service and United Library Supply. EBSCO is probably 
the largest U.S. serials vendor. In addition, there are smaller firms that provide good-
quality service to libraries and information centers. However, as discussed later, their 
numbers are decreasing. Most countries with an active book trade have similar organi-
zations. Libraries often use a vendor in countries where they buy large quantities of 
materials. As a general rule a vendor in the country of origin has a better chance of 
locating a desired item than does one from another country. There also are specialized 
vendors, such as Majors, a leading firm for STM books, and French Language Resources, 
a Canadian firm that provides French-language books for schools and classrooms. 
</p>
<p> Baker &amp; Taylor, Brodart, and Follett focus on public and school library needs. 
Blackwell North America and Midwest Library Service handle the academic library </p>

<p>110 6&mdash;Distributors and Vendors
</p>
<p>market primarily. Almost all vendors offer some combination, if not all, of the following 
in addition to the basic order fulfillment service: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Preorder searching and verification&middot;many allow a search and direct down-
loading into an order form. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Selection assistance, such as access to reviews of items from major review 
journals&middot;many public and school libraries require any purchased title to be 
selected on the basis of published reviews. 
</p>
<p> &bull; More than one type of format (printed books, e-books, audio/video record-
ings, for example). 
</p>
<p> &bull; Electronic table of contents and/or book jacket art for ordered titles&middot;
academic libraries like the table of contents service as it becomes search-
able in the online public access catalog (OPAC) and is a valued service by 
researchers. For a public library the cover art, attached to OPAC record, helps 
attract a reader to the item, rather like bookstores displaying many titles with 
the jacket facing out rather than having the spine showing. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Cataloging and shelf-ready processing&middot;cataloging can take the form of 
downloading a machine-readable cataloging (MARC) record into the li-
brary&Ecirc;s ILS for catalogers to modify as necessary or having the vendor actu-
ally do the cataloging and forwarding the final record. Shelf ready means the 
items arrive with labels and any necessary book pockets, property stamps, 
date due slips, and so on in place and ready to go into the collection. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Customized management data&middot;see the discussion that follows. 
</p>
<p> In addition to materials, Brodart is a major resource for library furniture and equipment 
(e.g., book trucks, step stools, shelving units) and supplies (e.g., bar codes, date due slips). 
</p>
<p> Brodart also offers a rental service, the McNaughton Plan, which is designed to 
help solve the problem of providing an adequate number of high-demand titles for books 
and audio recordings. Most public libraries face the challenge of having a high demand 
for popular titles; however, that high demand only lasts a short time. The challenge is 
how to meet the demand and yet not spend too much money on short-term interest 
items. One solution libraries employ is to buy two or three copies and set up a reservation 
or request queue for those wishing to read or listen to the item. The public understands 
the challenge but still does express frustration with the reservation system. McNaughton 
offers another alternative: rent multiple copies for the duration of the title&Ecirc;s popularity 
and return the unneeded copies. Brodart describes the plan as a  leasing  program. The 
plan offers high-demand items that Brodart&Ecirc;s staff selects. A library cannot order just 
any book; it must be on Brodart&Ecirc;s list of high-demand titles. Some financial savings 
occur as there are no processing costs because the books come shelf-ready and the leas-
ing fee is substantially lower than the item&Ecirc;s purchase price. Further, users are happy 
because of shorter waiting times for the latest bestseller. All in all, anyone involved 
in meeting recreational reading needs will find the program worth investigating. 
</p>
<p> Acquisitions departments generate a variety of reports from their ILS about the 
unit&Ecirc;s activities, as illustrated later in the chapter. Vendors can also supply some man-
agement data for the department that are drawn from outside sources. One type of data 
that is very useful for budget planning purposes is the average cost of materials. The 
following is an example of pricing information from a vendor for a library: </p>

<p>Making the Selection&mdash;Factors to Consider 111
</p>
<p> Customer Service Considerations 
</p>
<p> As the second chapter epigraph suggests, customer service is no small issue for 
libraries. The list of topics described in Myers&Ecirc;s quotation as being customer service&ndash;
related is long but is still not a complete listing of all the challenges that arise and that 
require staff interaction between the library and vendor. Long-term relationships are the 
result of respectful dealings by both parties as well as taking some time to learn about 
the other party&Ecirc;s challenges and needs. Such relationships are also based on having real-
istic expectations of one another. 
</p>
<p> Acquisition departments have a right to expect that a vendor will provide 
</p>
<p> &bull; a large inventory of titles in appropriate formats, 
 &bull; prompt and accurate order fulfillment, 
 &bull; prompt and accurate reporting on items not in stock, 
 &bull; personal service at a reasonable price, 
 &bull; prompt technical support for problems with shared technology, and 
 &bull; timely correction of faulty services such as incorrect cataloging or incor-
</p>
<p>rectly processed shelf-ready items. 
</p>
<p> Most vendors are reasonably good at meeting those expectations once they become 
aware of the library&Ecirc;s specific issues. Getting them become aware is sometimes a chal-
lenge, however. Telephone trees are a bane for almost all customers, not just library staff. 
E-mail and &bdquo;contact us&permil; boxes often seem to lead to black holes rather than service. In

<p>112 6&mdash;Distributors and Vendors
</p>
<p>defense of the vendors, current economic conditions cause them as many staffing issues 
as libraries face. Layoffs, furloughs, and frozen vacant positions force organizations to 
employ technology to help address some of the personnel shortfalls. Patience is a key 
to maintaining civil working relationships. 
</p>
<p> Vendors also have a right to expect the following from libraries: 
</p>
<p> &bull; A reasonable time to gain an understanding of the library&Ecirc;s needs, 
 &bull; Cooperation in placing orders using the firm&Ecirc;s system rather than complaints 
</p>
<p>that &bdquo;we did it this way with our former vendor,&permil; 
 &bull; Keeping paperwork to a minimum and attempting to streamline library 
</p>
<p>operations, 
 &bull; Prompt payment for services, and, 
 &bull; That customers will not require too many exceptions to the firm&Ecirc;s normal 
</p>
<p>processes. 
</p>
<p> Libraries sometimes employ practices that are somewhat outmoded and reflect an 
attitude of &bdquo;we always do it this way&permil; and expect the vendor to change its practices 
to conform to the library&Ecirc;s approach. Unless there is a parent institutional require-
ment involved, the library should be open to at least considering modifying its prac-
tices. Being open about the average invoice payment cycle, ability to authorize 
partial payments, and similar matters from the start will also create a more positive 
relationship. 
</p>
<p> One action for libraries to avoid is dumping their problem orders on vendors and 
ordering easy items directly from the publishers to maximize its discount. This is a 
shortsighted practice. Without the income from easy, high-volume items, no vendor 
can stay in business. Someone has to handle the problem orders, and most vendors will 
try to track down the difficult items, especially for good customers. However, libraries 
should give vendors easy orders as well. Many of the problems facing vendors involve 
cash flow. Lack of cash has been the downfall of many businesses, and it becomes criti-
cal for vendors if they are expected to handle too many problem orders; staff expenses 
go up, but income does not. 
</p>
<p> Vendors provide a valuable service to libraries. Given a good working relationship, 
both parties benefit. But where does a library learn about vendors and their services? 
Beyond attending library association conferences and word-of-mouth suggestions from 
peers, several guides are available. General publications such as  Literary Market Place, 
International Literary Market Place, International Subscription Agent,  Quill &amp; Quire&Ecirc;s 
 Canadian Publishers Directory,  or specialized lists by format, region of the world, and 
subject matter will provide a long list of possibilities. One can also post questions about 
vendor experiences on acquisitions discussion lists, such as AcqWeb, see list of useful 
Web sites at the end of the chapter. 
</p>
<p> One question for a library to answer is how many vendors to use. There are pros 
and cons for consolidating business with only one or two vendors just as there are for 
using a number of vendors for the same type of product. Consolidation usually means 
the vendor gains a better sense of the library&Ecirc;s requirements, perhaps provides a better 
discount, and may even offer some free services. Having several vendors for a type of 
product may provide a higher discount, at least when there is a degree of competition 
for the library&Ecirc;s business. One drawback is that the service may not be as good and </p>

</p>
<p>perhaps the vendors will not have the resources to invest in newer technology. The pri-
mary concern should be service followed by financial strength&middot;it is not unheard of for 
major vendors to have serious financial problems. 
</p>
<p> VENDOR EVALUATION 
</p>
<p> Acquisitions departments should engage in ongoing monitoring of vendor per-
formance. In the past, monitoring vendors was time-consuming and difficult, and it 
still is if a library is working with a manual acquisitions system. However, automated 
acquisitions systems can produce a variety of useful management and vendor reports 
very quickly and in various formats. Knowing what to do with the quantity of data the 
systems can produce is another matter. 
</p>
<p> Acquisitions staff undertake two types of evaluation. One is monitoring vendor 
performance with an eye to identifying small concerns that left unnoticed could become 
a major issue. The other is a formal assessment of the vendor with an eye toward chang-
ing vendors or renewing a contract. 
</p>
<p> One obvious issue that arises in the evaluation process is which vendor performs 
best on a given type of order (examples are conference proceedings, music scores, or 
video recordings). The first step is to decide what  best  means. Highest discount? 
Fastest delivery? Most accurate reports? Highest percentage of the order filled with the 
first shipment? All of the above? The answer varies from library to library depending 
on local needs and conditions. Once the library defines  best,  it knows what data to get 
from the system. Following are other evaluation issues: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Who handles rush orders most efficiently? 
 &bull; Who handles international orders most effectively&middot;a dealer in the country 
</p>
<p>of origin or a general international dealer? 
 &bull; Are specialty dealers more effective in handling their specialties than are 
</p>
<p>general dealers? 
 &bull; Who handles claims the quickest? 
</p>
<p> Following are sample system reports illustrating several years&Ecirc; performance of 
some book vendors for a hypothetical library. The first example illustrates claim perfor-
mance of 11 vendors.

<p> In addition to generating system reports based on normal operating procedures, a 
library can conduct some experiments by placing a random sample of a type of order 
with several vendors to assess their performance. When doing a test or experiment, be 
certain that each vendor receives approximately the same mix of titles, that no vendor 
receives more or fewer easy or hard-to-handle items. Often, the normal procedure data 
reflect the use of a particular vendor for only one type of order. This makes comparing 
vendor performance rather meaningless because one is not comparing like groups. The 
library can use the test method to select a vendor for a particular type of order and use 
the operating data approach to monitor ongoing performance. 
</p>
<p> Checking on the performance of serials vendors is more difficult. Most libraries 
use only one domestic serials vendor and perhaps a second firm that specializes in jour-
nals from other countries. A library that is just establishing a current subscription 
list, or starting a large number of new subscriptions, might consider splitting the list 
between two or more vendors for several years to determine which would be the best 
sole source for the long term. 
</p>
<p> A limited amount of checking is possible through comparisons with other librar-
ies. Often, this type of checking is done in a casual manner, that is, by merely asking a 
colleague in another library, &bdquo;Do you use vendor X? How do you like them?&permil; or &bdquo;How 
much is your service charge? &permil; To make valid and useful comparisons, a library needs to 
know the other library&Ecirc;s title mix. 
</p>
<p> One way to compare serials vendors is to investigate a sample of commonly held 
titles. Factors to examine include the service charges on those titles, the effectiveness 
of claims processing, and other issues like vendor follow-up and handling of credit 
memos. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>116 6&mdash;Distributors and Vendors
</p>
<p> In any vendor evaluation, keep in mind some of the problems vendors have with 
producers: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Changes in title, or not publishing the title; 
 &bull; Not being informed when publishing schedules change or when publishers 
</p>
<p>suspend or cease publication; 
 &bull; Incorrect International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) or International 
</p>
<p>Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs); 
 &bull; Producers refusing to take returns; 
 &bull; Producers refusing to sell through vendors; 
 &bull; Producers reducing discounts or charging for freight and handling, when 
</p>
<p>those were free in the past; 
 &bull; Poor fulfillment on the producer&Ecirc;s part; 
 &bull; Constantly changing policies on the producer&Ecirc;s part; and 
 &bull; Producer price increases without prior notice. 
</p>
<p> References to several models for conducting vendor evaluation studies are included 
in the Suggested Reading section of this chapter. 
</p>
<p> Several years ago, a student in one of the author&Ecirc;s (Evans) courses asked during 
a discussion of vendors, &bdquo;Why are you so pro-vendor? They are our enemies, with all 
their high prices and low discounts.&permil; Perhaps Evans&Ecirc;s work experience in bookstores, 
publishing, and libraries is a factor in his not being highly critical of vendors. However, 
it is not a matter of being &bdquo;so pro-vendor,&permil; but rather recognizing that there are at least 
two sides to most stories. Libraries depend on vendors; they offer services that save 
libraries time, effort, and staffing. Libraries need vendors and need to understand their 
problems. 
</p>
<p> That said, libraries must monitor vendor performance, question charges, and 
challenge charges that seem inappropriate. Maintaining good relations is everyone&Ecirc;s 
business. If librarians, vendors, and producers take time to learn about one another&Ecirc;s 
business, working relationships will be better. 
</p>
<p> RETAIL OUTLETS 
</p>
<p> The book distribution system in the United States is cumbersome and frequently 
adds to the cost of books. A simplified system would benefit everyone. Perhaps the best 
illustration of the complexity of the system is in the area of discounts, returns, billings, 
and so forth. Each year the American Booksellers Association publishes a 500-page 
guide,  ABA Book Buyer&Ecirc;s Handbook.  1  Pity the poor bookseller who, confronted with all 
of the other problems of a bookstore, must also work through a mass of legal forms and 
sales conditions for purchasing from various publishers. This process creates extra work 
for the bookseller and publisher, and they undoubtedly pass their costs on to the buyer. 
</p>
<p> In general, bookstores can be a valuable means of acquiring new books. Carrying 
out visual inspection of local stores and discussing the library&Ecirc;s needs with bookstore 
owners can forge an important link in the selection and acquisition program. Libraries 
in large metropolitan areas generally have good bookstores nearby, but many libraries 
are lucky if there is one bookstore in the community. Although most libraries will spend </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Retail Outlets 117
</p>
<p>only a small portion of the materials budget in such stores, the possibility is worth 
exploring. Most bookstores have limited potential as a major source of supply for ac-
quisitions departments, but when a general bookstore exists nearby, the library ought to 
talk to the owner to determine what, if any, business relationship might be possible. It 
may take time for the relationship to fully develop, but it can prove mutually beneficial. 
The large U.S. national chains, such as Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble, operate very dif-
ferently from local stores and are not likely to be able to accommodate library needs 
beyond occasionally allowing a corporate or educational discount on some of the titles 
they carry. 
</p>
<p> Quebec libraries must purchase their books from at least three accredited book-
stores. Such bookstores must be based in Quebec and owned by a Quebecer. Some 
libraries, however, are able to buy books directly from distributors because they have 
private funding also. 
</p>
<p> A reasonable question to pose at this point is, &bdquo;what about Internet bookstores?&permil; 
Is Amazon.com a retailer or a wholesaler? An early 2001 check of Yahoo&Ecirc;s Books page 
had links to more than 490 online stores (both new and out-of-print [OP] sources). 
Today such a search generates thousands of hits. Certainly these stores are popular, 
but not always the quickest means of getting a book in hand, at least during holiday 
periods. 
</p>
<p> Amazon.com is a resource for libraries for the purchase of some popular items. 
One challenge for libraries is developing a workable means of payment. The online 
shopping sites are based on credit card payments. Libraries and their parent organiza-
tions operate on a purchase order or invoice system. Although the situation is changing, 
many libraries cannot get a credit card or the necessary approval for a line of credit due 
to regulations or reluctance on the part of the library&Ecirc;s parent organization. Some de-
partments will use a personal card and go through a reimbursement process; however, 
this is not a long-term or high-volume solution. One of the authors, Evans, worked at 
an academic library where, after a significant passage of time and effort, it was able to 
secure a corporate account with Amazon. Overall, the effort was of only marginal value 
to the acquisitions department. 
</p>
<p> Monica Fusich wrote a brief article on the use of Amazon.com and other e-stores 
that appeared in  C&amp;RL News.  2  She outlined several services she found useful as a col-
lection development officer who has other duties as well. Being a reference librarian 
or having some other full-time assignment as well as having selection responsibilities 
is very common in the current library environment. Fusich mentioned the following 
features: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Cumulated book reviews (one must remember some of the reviews are from 
the general public) 
</p>
<p> &bull; Search and browsing capability 
 &bull; Size of the database(s) 
 &bull; Coverage of in-print and OP titles and nonbook media 
 &bull; Notification services (a rather limited selective dissemination of informa-
</p>
<p>tion service as of mid-1999) 
</p>
<p> A more recent assessment of Amazon as a library vendor was Paul Orkiszewski&Ecirc;s 
comparative study of Amazon and a traditional library book and media vendor. He </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>118 6&mdash;Distributors and Vendors
</p>
<p>found that on average the Amazon discount was lower (8.75%) than that of the tradi-
tional vendors (15.24%). One of his conclusions was, &bdquo;Libraries interested in using 
Amazon should find it useful for trade and popular press books, DVDs, and book and 
media items that are needed quickly.&permil; 3  Although e-stores are not  the  answer to the chal-
lenges facing busy acquisition departments, they can be of assistance and should not be 
dismissed out of hand. 
</p>
<p> OUT-OF-PRINT, ANTIQUARIAN, AND RARE BOOK DEALERS 
</p>
<p> Retrospective collection building is one of the most interesting and challenging 
areas of acquisitions work. Libraries buy retrospectively for two reasons: to fill in gaps 
in the collection and to replace worn-out or lost copies of titles. There has been a steady 
decline in retrospective buying on the part of libraries over the past 20 years because 
limited budgets and the need to increase purchases of nonprint and electronic resources. 
Another factor in the decline has been the proliferation of bibliographic databases such 
as OCLC, which make locating a copy of an OP title to borrow through interlibrary loan 
much easier. As a result, acquisitions staff and selectors have decreasing experience to 
draw upon when they need to work in this field. Dealers in this field are a special breed 
unlike other vendors with which the library has more experience. 
</p>
<p> One outcome of the decline is that the field, which has always been very dependent 
on collectors, is even more driven today by collector interests than by library needs. 
Allowing for overlap, there are two broad categories of OP dealers. (It should be noted 
that most of these individuals dislike the label &bdquo;secondhand dealer.&permil;) One category fo-
cuses primarily on general OP books, that is, on buying and selling relatively recent OP 
books. Often, these books sell at prices that are the same as, or only slightly higher than, 
their publication price. The other category of dealer focuses on rare, antiquarian, and 
special (for example, fore-edge painted, miniature, or private press) books. Prices for 
this type of book can range from around U.S. $10 to several thousand dollars per item. 
</p>
<p> The face of this field is changing. Margaret Landesman provided an excellent, 
detailed outline of the current dealer categories 4 : 
</p>
<p>&bull;    Book scouts that work part-time or full-time to search out desirable books 
and sell them to dealers and collectors. Such individuals are one of the pri-
mary reasons one gets so many hits when searching the Web for OP titles. 
They carry little or no stock. 
</p>
<p>  &bull;  Operators of neighborhood stores that have limited service hours, often 
only one or two days a week. Stores are in low-cost areas. Today, many op-
erators only use the facility as a storage unit and depend on selling through 
the Web and a few very loyal customers rather than walk-in trade. Their 
stock is generally recent materials and covers a variety of subject areas. 
</p>
<p>  &bull;  Specialized dealers that often issue catalogs in addition to their Web post-
ings and do searching in their specialty. Their stock is limited in scope, but 
successful dealers have depth of coverage in their specialties. 
</p>
<p>  &bull;  General out-of-print dealers that have a substantial store and a rather large 
stock in varied areas are what most people think of when thinking about OP 
dealers. With the Web, searching for titles is a common service and a few 
issue catalogs. </p>

<p>Out-of-Print, Antiquarian, and Rare Book Dealers 119
</p>
<p>  &bull;  Mixed in-print and OP stores&middot;often a store that was an independent new 
bookshop that is trying to survive the competition from the superstores by 
diversifying. A good example of a mixed store is Powell&Ecirc;s City of Books in 
Portland, Oregon (http://www.powells.com/). 
</p>
<p>&bull;    Academic library book vendors that also offer OP search services. 
  &bull;  Rare book dealers that specialize in rare and expensive titles. Most estab-
</p>
<p>lished rare book dealers do not handle the more ordinary scholarly OOP 
titles, but many general OP dealers also handle some rare books. 
</p>
<p> Most of such dealers have small shops in low-rent areas or operate out of their homes. 
Because of this diversity, it is difficult to make many generalizations about this group. 
</p>
<p> Most libraries have occasion to use the services of these dealers. Acquisitions de-
partments that handle purchases for large research collections tend to spend much of 
their time (or at least they did in the past) engaged in retrospective purchasing activities. 
Public libraries also buy from OP dealers, especially for replacement copies and occa-
sionally for retrospective collection building. School libraries make limited use of this 
distribution system for replacement copies. Scientific and technical libraries rarely need 
to worry about acquiring retrospective materials. 
</p>
<p> Many acquisitions librarians and book dealers classify OP book distribution ser-
vices into three general types: (1) a complete book service, (2) a complete sales service, 
and (3) a complete bookstore. The first two may operate in a manner that does not 
allow, or at least require, customers to come to the seller&Ecirc;s location. All contact is by 
e-mail, telephone, and occasionally by regular mail. The owner may maintain only a 
small stock of choice items in a garage or basement. In a  complete book service,  a dealer 
actively searches for items for a customer, even if the items are not in stock. In the past 
this was the standard approach for serious retrospective collection development. To-
day with several OP Web search sites many libraries handle all the work themselves. 
</p>
<p> A  sales service  is just what the name implies: A dealer reads the wanted sections of 
book trade Web sites and publications and sends off quotes on items in his stock. Such 
services seldom place ads or conduct searches for a customer. The  complete bookstore  
is a store operation that depends on in-person trade. Stores of this type often engage in 
book service and sales service activities as well. They are also becoming an endangered 
species. 
</p>
<p> Since 2000, the OP trade has become very dependent upon the Web, and there are 
thousands of OP dealers with a Web presence. To some degree the Web has kept prices 
down, or slowed their increase. Checking prices through a site such as Abebooks (http://
www.abebooks.com) is very easy. (This site is the digital version of what was the stan-
dard U.S. journal for the OP trade&middot; AB Bookman&Ecirc;s Weekly.  The site was established in 
1995 and has no direct connection with the journal.) 
</p>
<p> An example of the power of Web searching for OP titles is one done in August 
2009 for Charles Dickens&Ecirc;s books. A general search turned up 77,000+ copies ranging 
in price from U.S. $1.00 to tens of thousands of dollars. Narrowing the search to first 
editions dropped the number of hits to 1,837. Again, the lowest price was $1.00; how-
ever, item 1,837 was a collection of five volumes of Dickens&Ecirc;s Christmas stories&middot;each 
a first edition first printing&middot;for a mere U.S. $42,500. Sellers were from many countries 
(a total of 21&middot;for example, Australia, Canada, Denmark, India, Norway, Scotland, and 
the U.K.) and cities across the United States. </p>

<p>120 6&mdash;Distributors and Vendors
</p>
<p> When Henry Fairfield Osborn&Ecirc;s two-volume set  Proboscidea: A Monograph of 
the Discovery, Evolution, Migration and Extinction of the Mastodons and Elephants 
of the World  (American Museum of Natural History, vol. 1, 1936 and vol. 2, 1942 ), an 
example of a title that might reflect the interest of a science library, was searched only 
three sets turned up on abebook.com and bookfinder.com. One set was available from a 
dealer in Edinburgh, Scotland, and two sets were available from U.S. dealers&middot;in Ithaca, 
New York, and Iowa City, Iowa&middot;and prices ranged from US$4,179.60 to US$5,800. 
Before OP online searching was possible such a search or want listing could have gone 
for years before there was success. Now, in a matter of minutes, definitive results are 
available. If you don&Ecirc;t get a hit, in most cases dozens of hits, you can be reasonably 
sure the item is not available or you are lacking some critical data about the title. One 
reason for suspecting the item is not available is that sites such as abebooks.com and 
bookfinder.com have listings from tens of thousands dealers worldwide and the Web 
has become their major source of business. 
</p>
<p> As with dealer&Ecirc;s catalog descriptions, one must be careful to read the description 
with a critical mind, at least for rare-book purchases. Despite the need for caution, the 
Web has indeed changed the nature of retrospective collection development. Dealer 
descriptions and condition statements can be very idiosyncratic and one must read them 
with a degree of caution. There are no official standards for such information. Some 
years ago  AB Bookman&Ecirc;s Weekly  put forward some suggested terms and their definition. 
What follows can only be thought of as broad meanings to help assess what a dealer 
may be describing. 
</p>
<p> Two of the top-level condition terms you may see are  as new  and  fine.  Presum-
ably an &bdquo;as new&permil; implies a flawless item&middot;the identical condition as when published&middot;
including a perfect dust jacket, if that was part of the original publication. Sometimes a 
dealer will use  mint  for this state. &bdquo;Fine&permil; is a slightly less perfect state; perhaps there is 
a little evidence of shelf wear and use but of a very minor nature.  Very good  and  good  
are conditions that most libraries find acceptable for general collection replacement 
copies&middot;there is evidence of wear.  Fair  and  poor  condition states probably are not suit-
able for libraries except when nothing else is available and the need is very strong as 
they imply some defects in the item.  Ex-library,  as the term indicates, means the copy 
has the usual stamping, perforations, spindling, and other mutilations that libraries use 
to property mark an item. 
</p>
<p> A library may assume that most OP dealers sell their stock as described or &bdquo;as is.&permil; 
If there is no statement about the item&Ecirc;s condition, it should be in good or better condi-
tion. A common statement in catalogs is &bdquo;terms&middot;all books in original binding and in 
good or better condition unless otherwise stated.&permil; 
</p>
<p> One requisite that a library ought to use is the OP dealer&Ecirc;s reputation for honesty, 
service, and fair prices. To gain such a reputation requires a considerable period of time 
in this field. In a Web-based environment, this issue is a challenge for libraries. If one is 
only purchasing a $20 or $30 replacement copy, the risks of dealing with an unknown 
dealer are not all that high. For higher-priced materials there are real risks. The risks 
were there in the pre-electronic environment as well, but the ease of posting an item for 
sale on the Web has magnified the opportunities for less than honest sellers to make a sale. 
</p>
<p> When you search for a title on a site such as abebooks.com, your result appears 
as a listing of sellers, prices and a brief description of the book&Ecirc;s condition. While it is </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Out-of-Print, Antiquarian, and Rare Book Dealers 121
</p>
<p>possible to order directly from the result pages it is advisable to follow the available 
link to the seller&Ecirc;s page and, if there is one, the home page for the seller. One the best 
assurances of a reputable dealer is membership in one the bookseller associations such 
as Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America. That is not to say that not being a 
member is necessarily a negative sign, but its presence is a positive one. Also, going to 
the seller&Ecirc;s pages provides important information about terms and conditions, as well as 
contact information where you can attempt to clarify issues and perhaps try to negotiate 
the price. (Yes, it is possible to try to get a better price&middot;you will not get one if you don&Ecirc;t 
ask. It is probably not worth the time to try this with inexpensive items though.) 
</p>
<p> One element in the OP trade is very mysterious to the outsider and even to librar-
ians who have had years of experience with these dealers: How do dealers determine 
the asking price? (The rule of thumb of paying one-third or less of the expected sales 
income is probably ignored more than it is practiced. The &bdquo;or less&permil; is the key.) The 
markup is at least 100 percent, but how much more? One may find a book in an OP 
store with no price on it, take it to the salesperson (often the owner), ask the price, 
and receive, after a quick look, the answer, &bdquo;Oh, yes. That is  X  dollars.&permil; Sometimes 
the amount is lower than one expects, other times much higher, but most of the time it 
is close to the price the library is willing to pay. Some salespersons seem to be mind 
readers and know exactly how much a customer is willing to pay. Sol Malkin summed 
up the outsider&Ecirc;s feeling about pricing in the OP trade: &bdquo;Many new book dealers think 
of the antiquarian bookseller as a second-hand junkman or as a weird character who 
obtains books by sorcery, prices them by cannibalistic necromancy, and sells them by 
black magic.&permil; 5  
</p>
<p> As amusing as Malkin&Ecirc;s theory may be, prices are in actuality based on a number 
of interrelated factors: 
</p>
<p>  1. How much it costs to acquire the item 
  2. The amount of current interest in collecting a particular subject or author 
  3. The number of copies printed and the number of copies still in existence 
  4. The physical condition of the copy 
  5. Any special features of the particular copy (autographed by the author or 
</p>
<p>signed or owned by a famous person, for example) 
  6. What other dealers are asking for copies of the same edition in the same 
</p>
<p>condition 
</p>
<p> In the past it might have appeared that magic is the essential ingredient in successful 
OP operations&middot;getting the price right. To a large degree, dealers set prices after they 
know the answers to the questions of supply and potential sales. Without question, 
the current asking price is the major determining factor&middot;given equal conditions in 
the other five areas. The ability to search online to determine how many copies are 
available and what their asking price is has simplified pricing for both the dealer and 
the buyer. 
</p>
<p> Working in this area can be fun and frustrating at the same time. Clearly, there is 
a need for experience with dealers to know if their descriptions of their offerings are 
good enough for the library. There is also the nagging question of fair-market price 
for what is often a one-of-a-kind offering, at least at that moment. Commercial guides </p>

<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> The distribution system for books and other library materials is varied and com-
plex and must be understood and appreciated by acquisitions staff. This chapter pro-
vides highlights of what the library needs to know; and it portrays just the beginning 
of a long, challenging, but enjoyable learning process. Jobbers, book dealers, and 
media vendors are more than willing to explain how they modify their operations to 
accommodate library requirements, when they know that a librarian has taken time to 
learn something about their operations. 
</p>

<p> The book is not dead. In fact, the world is producing more books than ever 
before. According to Bowker, 700,000 new titles were published worldwide in 
1998; 859,000 in 2003 and 976,000 in 2007. Despite the Great Recession of 
2009 that has hit hard the publishing industry so hard; one million new books 
will soon produced each year.

<p> Creating an e-library is an ambitious project for any library, because the pro-
cess attempts to recreate the library collection and the library services&middot;in 
virtual space. In its simplest form an e-library is a collection of Web-accessible

Web sites and fee-based Web accessible databases.

<p> Paper-based books are dead! Long live the paper-based book! For the better part 
of 40 years various pundits have predicted the imminent demise of the book as well as 
the coming of the paperless office. Neither prediction has yet come true. They both 
probably will occur sometime in the future; however, neither is likely during the life-
time of this edition of  Introduction to Library Technical Services.  As a result, libraries 
will continue to acquire at least some, if not a sizable number of, paper-based books, 
magazines, newspapers, and other documents until that time arrives. If you have doubts, 
spend some time in your local bookstore and public library and observe the number of 
people buying, reading, and utilizing paper-based items. 
</p>
<p> Acquisitions departments probably could function without knowing very much 
about the producers of the product they purchase. However, the departments will be 
more effective and more efficient when the staff understands something about the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>126 7&mdash;Print and Digital Books
</p>
<p>production side of the information cycle: creation, production, distribution, access/stor-
age, and usage. Understanding the factors that enter into the costs and discounts of the 
products a library purchases assists in the business activities it undertakes (better vendor 
relations) and end-user interactions (better public relations). 
</p>
<p> In the past, information producers could be categorized by their products: (1) those 
who produced printed matter (books, periodicals, newspapers, and the like) and 
(2) those who produced other media, such as sound recording or videos. It was rare for 
a producer to work in both areas. Today the situation is different. Although some com-
panies still focus on one information format, most major publishers make material 
available in both broad categories. Even scholarly and university presses have moved 
into electronic publishing, including offering titles solely available on CDs or in other 
digital formats. 
</p>
<p> The following sections provide an overview of how the items that libraries acquire 
come into being. It also provides some useful information that will make working with 
producers and vendors more effective. 
</p>
<p> WHAT IS PUBLISHING? 
</p>
<p> Publishers and producers supply the necessary capital and editorial assistance 
required to transform an author&Ecirc;s manuscript/ideas into a book or electronic product. 
(Two exceptions to this are vanity and subsidy presses, which are discussed later in 
this section.) Generally, publishers and producers perform six basic functions: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Tap sources of materials (manuscripts) by contracting with authors. 
 &bull; Raise and supply the capital to produce books or e-products. 
 &bull; Aid in the development of the manuscript by working with the authors and 
</p>
<p>providing editorial assistance. 
 &bull; Contract for the manufacturing (printing, binding, formatting) of the mate-
</p>
<p>rials for sale. 
 &bull; Distribute the materials and promote and advertise the titles. 
 &bull; Maintain records of sales, contracts, and correspondence relating to the 
</p>
<p>production and sale of materials. 
</p>
<p> Producers usually have five basic organizational units: administration, editorial, 
design/production, marketing, and fulfillment. Administration ensures that there is 
adequate capital and coordination between the functional units. 
</p>
<p> It is in the editorial area that producers face their biggest challenge. They must 
have a strong backlist of titles (items released in years past) and an annual output of 
new material. Acquisitions and managing editors discuss and review ideas for new 
titles or articles in the case of magazines/journals. They develop a list (a combina-
tion of prior publications, manuscripts in production, and titles under contract) that 
they hope will achieve a profit while avoiding unnecessary competition with other 
producers. 
</p>
<p> Securing and reviewing manuscripts is a time-consuming activity for most edi-
tors. An educated guess is that editors reject approximately nine-tenths of all unso-
licited manuscripts after the first examination. After the first complete reading, still </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>What Is Publishing? 127
</p>
<p>more manuscripts are rejected. Even after a careful review by several people, all of 
whom having favorable reactions, the editor may not accept the manuscript. Three 
common reasons for the rejection are that (1) the title will not fit into the new list, 
(2) the sales potential (market) is thought to be too small, and (3) the cost of produc-
tion would be too high. 
</p>
<p> Librarians and readers sometimes complain that commercial producers are ex-
clusively, or at least overly, concerned with profit and have little concern for quality. 
What these people forget is that publishing houses are businesses and must show a 
profit if they are to continue to operate. Barbara Fister, in an article that compared the 
views of a publisher&Ecirc;s editor and a librarian about the publishing industry, wrote this 
about book quality from the editor&Ecirc;s perspective; 
</p>
<p> I don&Ecirc;t want to publish schlock. I&Ecirc;d much rather publish quality books, and I 
fight really hard to get attention for my authors, but we have to publish what 
people want. The fact is, seven out of ten books don&Ecirc;t recoup their costs. It&Ecirc;s 
the best sellers and the steady sellers on the back list that pay the bills. 1  
</p>
<p> Even the not-for-profit producers such as university presses have to attempt to break 
even each year. Such presses know that not every title released will sell well enough 
to recover its production costs. Thus, some titles must do well enough to generate 
the income that allows for a break-even year. In good economic times, the university 
maybe willing to cover any losses in a year as part of its obligation to scholarship; 
however, in difficult times it may not be able to underwrite a series of losing years. 
</p>
<p> Librarians also complain that the producers are not releasing enough titles on this 
or that topic. Again, the issue goes back to the producers&Ecirc; need to at least break even 
to stay in business. It would be difficult for most producers to stay operational for 
very long if all they could depend upon were sales to libraries. This is not to say library 
purchasing is insignificant, it is&middot;libraries spent more than $2 billion in 2003. 2  Even 
the American Library Association&Ecirc;s publication program is not solely dependent on 
library sales&middot;there is an expectation that there will be at least some sales to indi-
viduals and perhaps even some sales as textbooks. Commercial publishers that have 
product &bdquo;lines&permil; that focus on librarianship spread their focus among several markets, 
especially on textbooks. Editors must make their decisions, at least in part, the sales 
potential for a title not just the content. 
</p>
<p> Production/design and marketing join with the editorial team to make the final 
decisions regarding production details. Most publishers can package and price publi-
cations in a variety of ways. Some years ago, the Association of University Publish-
ers released an interesting book,  One Book Five Ways,  3    which provides a fascinating 
picture of how five different university presses would handle the same project. In all 
five functional areas, the presses would have proceeded differently, from contract 
agreement (administration), copyediting (editorial), physical format/design (produc-
tion), pricing and advertising (marketing), to distribution (fulfillment). 
</p>
<p> Production staff consider such issues as page size, typeface, number and type of 
illustrative materials, and cover design, as well as typesetting, printing, and binding. 
Their input and the decision made regarding the physical form of the item play a 
major role in how much the title will cost. Although electronic and desktop publishing </p>
<p/>

<p>128 7&mdash;Print and Digital Books
</p>
<p>are changing how and who performs some production activities, the basic issues of 
design, layout, use of illustrations, and use of color remain unchanged. 
</p>
<p> Marketing departments are responsible for promoting and selling the product. 
They provide input about the sales potential of the title. Further, this unit often de-
cides how many review copies to distribute and to what review sources. (Reviews are 
a key element in libraries&Ecirc; and  the publics&Ecirc; making a purchase decision.) The marketing 
department decides where, when, or whether to place an advertisement for a title; ads 
play little role in a library&Ecirc;s decision to or not to acquire a title, however. All of these 
decisions influence the cost of the items produced. Many small publishers use direct 
mail (catalogs and brochures) or e-mail to market their books. Small presses present 
some challenges for acquisitions departments&middot;see the section on small presses later 
in this chapter. 
</p>
<p> One activity for which most marketing units are responsible is exhibits. For li-
brary personnel, conventions are one of the best places to meet publishers&Ecirc; represen-
tatives and have some input into the publishing decision-making process. From the 
publishers&Ecirc; point of view, if the conferees go to the exhibits, conventions can be a 
cost-effective way of reaching a large number of potential customers in a brief time. 
Library staff members should also remember that the fees exhibitors pay help under-
write the cost of the convention. 
</p>
<p> Publishers use a variety of distribution outlets, selling directly to individuals, 
institutions, retailers, and wholesalers. Distribution is a major problem for publish-
ers and libraries because of the number of channels available and the implications 
for acquiring a specific publication. Each channel has a different discount, and they 
are accessed through different sources. Production and distribution of information 
materials, whether print or nonprint, consist of several elements, all interacting with 
one another. Writers and creators of the material can and do distribute their output in 
several ways: directly to the community or public, to agents who in turn pass it on 
to producers, or directly to the producers. Producers seeking writers often approach 
agents with publication ideas. Figure 7.1 illustrates the complexity of the system by 
depicting the variety of channels publishers use to distribute their publications to the 
consumer.   
</p>
<p> Fulfillment activities are those needed to process an order and those connected 
with the warehousing of the materials produced. In many ways, fulfillment is the 
least controllable cost factor for a publisher. As noted earlier, a publisher&Ecirc;s distribu-
tion system is rather complex (see Figure 7.1). Libraries and information centers 
sometimes add to the cost of their purchases by requiring special handling of their 
orders. Keeping special needs to a minimum can help keep prices in check. Speeding 
up payments to publishers and vendors will also help slow price increases, because 
the longer a publisher has to carry an outstanding account, the more interest has to be 
paid. Ultimately, most increases in the cost of doing business result in a higher price 
for the buyer, so whatever libraries can do to help publishers control their fulfillment 
costs will also help their acquisitions budgets. 
</p>
<p> For various reasons, despite strong marketing efforts, some publications do not 
sell as well as expected. When this happens, sooner or later the publisher has to dis-
pose of the material; often these become remaindered items. A decision by the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Service ( Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,  
439 U.S. 522 [1979]) has influenced the size of press runs in the United States and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>What Is Publishing? 129
</p>
<p>the speed with which publishers remainder slow-moving warehouse stock. Remain-
dered items sell for a small fraction of their actual production costs. Prior to the  Thor 
 decision, businesses would write down the value of their inventories, or warehouse 
stock, to a nominal level at the end of the tax year. The resulting loss in the value of 
the inventory (which was, by and large, only a paper loss) then became a tax deduc-
tion for the company, thereby increasing the profit margin. Since  Thor,  publishers can 
only take such a deduction if the material is defective or offered for sale below actual 
production costs. Under the previous method, publishers could find it profitable to 
keep slow-selling titles in their warehouses for years. At first, the ruling increased 
the number of remaindered books, but now most publishers have cut back on the size 
of their print runs in an attempt to match inventories to expected sales volume. More 
often than not, this means higher unit costs and retail prices. The decision also means 
the idea of putting off the purchase of a book title for several years in order to main-
tain funding for journal subscriptions may mean the only option for securing the title 
is through the out-of-print trade.

</p>
<p> Anyone concerned with acquisitions budgets must make use of statistical data 
about publishing output and pricing in order to develop intelligent budget requests 
and work plans. Statistical data about the number of new titles available as paper-
backs, reprints, and so forth can be useful in planning the workload for the next fiscal 
year. Knowing the pricing patterns over a period of years and the expected acquisi-
tions budget allows libraries to project workload. The two most accessible sources 
of publishing statistics for the United States are  Publishers Weekly  and  The Bowker 
Annual.  Data in these resources, and almost all other statistical data about publishing, 
come from the American Book Producers Association (ABPA). It is also important to 
understand that not all publishers belong to that group; in fact, many of the small re-
gional publishers are not members. If the library tries to acquire many of its regional 
publications, it will not have as useful projection by just using ABPA data. 
</p>
<p> This brief overview outlines the most basic elements of publishing. Its purpose is 
to start a technical services novice thinking about the trade. 
</p>
<p> TYPES OF PUBLISHERS 
</p>
<p> The publication  Book Industry Trends  (from the Book industry Study Group) em-
ploys a 10-category system for grouping the book publishing industry in the United 
States: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Trade 
 &bull; Mass market 
 &bull; Book clubs 
 &bull; Mail order (including e-mail) 
 &bull; Religious 
 &bull; Professional 
 &bull; University presses 
 &bull; Elementary and high school (El-Hi) textbooks 
 &bull; College textbook 
 &bull; Publisher/distributor 
</p>
<p> Because  Book Industry Trends  is primarily interested in economic and statistical 
data and publishers can and do have several lines, their grouping is slightly different </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Types of Publishers 131
</p>
<p>from the one used in this book. (Note: Publishers often have several lines or divi-
sions that handle a specific type of publishing such as trade books, college textbooks, 
and mass-market paperbacks.) The following discussion provides an overview of the 
above and two additional types of publishing firms, some of which mirror the cat-
egories used by  Book Industry Trends,  and some that are more specific to the library 
world. Some are identified by different names. 
</p>
<p>  Trade publishers  produce a wide range of titles, both fiction and nonfiction, that 
have wide sales potential. HarperCollins; Alfred A. Knopf; Doubleday; Macmillan; 
Little, Brown; Thames &amp; Hudson; Random House; and McClelland &amp; Stewart are 
typical trade publishers. Many trade publishers have divisions that produce specialty 
titles, such as children&Ecirc;s, college textbooks, paperback, and reference. Trade publish-
ers have three markets: bookstores, libraries, and wholesalers. To sell their products, 
publishers occasionally employ sales representatives to visit prospective buyers in 
each of the markets. The goal is not only to sell titles but also to gather informa-
tion about topics of interest that the publisher is considering issuing one or more 
titles about. Discounts for trade titles tend to be higher than for many other types of 
publications. 
</p>
<p>  Specialty publishers  restrict output to a few areas or subjects. Facts on File is an 
example of a specialty publisher in the field of reference titles. Specialty publishers&Ecirc; 
audiences are smaller and more critical of the material than are trade publishers&Ecirc; audi-
ences. The categories of specialty publishers include reference, paperback, children&Ecirc;s, 
microform, music, cartographic, and subject areas such as librarianship. Discounts 
tend to be low for titles in this category. 
</p>
<p>  Textbook publishers,  especially those that target the primary and secondary 
schools (El-Hi), occupy one of the highest-risk areas of publishing. Most publish-
ers in this area develop a line of textbooks for several grades, for example, a social 
studies series. Preparation of such texts requires large amounts of time, energy, and 
money. Printing costs are high because most school texts feature expensive color 
plates and other specialized presswork. Such projects require large, up-front invest-
ments that must be recouped before a profit can be realized. If enough school dis-
tricts adopt a text, profits can be substantial, but failure to secure adoption can mean 
tremendous losses. Larger textbook firms, such as Ginn or Pearson Scott Foresman, 
produce several series to help ensure a profit or to cushion against loss. Given the ex-
treme volatility of this venue, the question remains, &bdquo;why would a company take this 
risk?&permil; During the 1990s, U.S. El-Hi publishers faced increased pressure to change the 
content of their publications from a variety of special-interest groups. This pressure 
adds yet another element of risk to textbook publishing. Discounts are rare for El-Hi 
titles, except in very large quantities, and low for college-level materials. 
</p>
<p>  Subject specialty  publishers share some of the characteristics of textbook houses. 
Many have narrow markets that are easy to identify. Focusing marketing efforts on a 
limited number of potential buyers allows specialty publishers to achieve a reason-
able return with less risk than a trade publisher takes on a nonfiction title. Specialty 
houses exist for a variety of fields; examples include art (e.g., Harry N. Abrams), 
music (e.g., Schirmer), science (e.g., Academic Press), technical (e.g., American 
Technical Publishers), law (e.g., West Publishing), and medical (e.g., W. B. Saunders). 
Many specialty books require expensive graphic preparation or presswork. Such 
presswork increases production costs, which is one of the reasons art, music, and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>132 7&mdash;Print and Digital Books
</p>
<p>science, medical, and technology titles are so costly. Another factor in their cost is 
their smaller market compared with the market for a trade title. A smaller market 
means the publisher must recover production costs from fewer books. Although the 
risk level is greater for specialty publishing than for trade publishing, it is much lower 
than that for El-Hi publishers. Discounts for such items are low to nonexistent. 
</p>
<p>  Vanity presses  differ from other publishing houses in that they receive most of 
their operating funds from the authors who pay to have their manuscript published. 
Two examples of such presses are Outskirts Press and iUniverse. Vanity presses al-
ways show a profit and never lack material to produce. They offer editing assistance 
for a fee, and they arrange to print as many copies of the book as the author can afford. 
Distribution is the author&Ecirc;s chore. Although providing some of the same functions 
as other publishers, they do not share the same risks. Many authors who use vanity 
presses donate copies of their books to local libraries, but such items frequently arrive 
with no indication that they are gifts. Books arriving in the acquisitions department 
without packing slips or invoices create extra work for the staff as they attempt to de-
termine why the item arrived. By knowing vanity publishers, acquisitions department 
staff can make their work easier. 
</p>
<p>  Private presses  are not business operations in the sense that the owners do not 
always expect to make money. Most private presses are an avocation rather than a 
vocation for the owners. Examples are Henry Morris, Bird, and Poull Press. In many 
instances, the owners do not sell their products but give them away. Most private 
presses are owned by individuals who enjoy fine printing and experimenting with 
type fonts and design. When an owner gives away the end product (often produced on 
a hand press), only a few copies are printed. In the past, many developments in type 
and book design originated with private presses, and some of the most beautiful ex-
amples of typographic and book design originated at private presses. Large research 
libraries often attempt to secure copies of items produced by private presses. 
</p>
<p>  Scholarly publishers,  as part of a not-for-profit organization, receive subsidies. 
Most are part of an academic institution (University of California Press), a museum 
(Museum of Northern Arizona), a research institution (Battelle Memorial Institute), 
or a learned society (American Philosophical Society). Scholars established these 
presses to produce scholarly books that would not be accepted by most for-profit pub-
lishers. As such, most scholarly books have limited sales appeal. A commercial, or 
for-profit, publisher considering a scholarly manuscript has three choices: (1) publish 
it and try to sell it at a price to ensure that costs are recovered; (2) publish it, sell it 
at a price comparable to commercial titles, and lose money; or (3) do not publish the 
item. Because of economic factors and a need to disseminate scholarly information 
regardless of cost (that is, even if it will lose money), the subsidized (by tax exemp-
tion, if nothing else) not-for-profit press exists. As publishing costs have skyrocketed, 
it has been necessary to fully subsidize some scholarly books, almost in the manner 
of a vanity press. 
</p>
<p> The role of the scholarly press in the economical and open dissemination of 
knowledge is critical. Every country needs some form of this type of press. Without 
scholarly presses, important works with limited appeal do not get published. Cer-
tainly there are times when a commercial house is willing to publish a book that will 
not show a profit because the publisher thinks the book is important, but relying on 
that type of willingness will, in the long run, mean that many important works will </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Types of Publishers 133
</p>
<p>never appear in print. Discounts for scholarly press titles are normally modest at best. 
Like their for-profit counterparts, scholarly presses are making ever-greater use of 
electronic publishing techniques. 
</p>
<p>  Government presses  are the world&Ecirc;s largest publishers. The combined annual 
output of government publications&middot;international (UNESCO); national (U.S. Gov-
ernment Printing Office and Canadian Government Publishing); and state, provincial, 
regional, and local (Los Angeles or state of California)&middot;dwarfs commercial output. 
In the past, many people thought of government publications as being characterized 
by poor physical quality or as uninteresting items that governments gave away. Today, 
some government publications rival the best offerings of commercial publishers and 
cost much less. (The government price does not fully recover production costs, so 
the price can be lower.) Most government publishing activity goes well beyond the 
printing of legislative hearings or actions and occasional executive materials. Often 
national governments publish essential and inexpensive (frequently free) materials on 
nutrition, farming, building trades, travel, and many other topics. (See chapter 10 for 
more detailed information about government publications.) 
</p>
<p>  Paperback publishers  produce two types of work: quality trade paperbacks and 
mass-market paperbacks. A trade publisher may have a quality paperback division 
or may issue the paperbound version of a book through the same division that is-
sued the hardcover edition. The publisher may publish original paperbacks, that is, 
a first edition in paperback. Distribution of quality paperbacks is the same as for 
hardcover books. Mass-market paperback publishers generally, but not always, issue 
reprints, or publications that first appeared in hardcover. Their distribution differs 
from that of other books. Their low price is based, in part, on the concept of mass 
sales. Therefore, they sell anywhere the publisher can get someone to handle them. 
The paperback books on sale in train and bus stations, airline terminals, corner stores, 
and kiosks are mass-market paperbacks. These books have a short shelf life compared 
with hardcovers. 
</p>
<p> Books with paper covers are not new. In some countries all books are published 
with paper covers, and buyers must bind the books they wish to keep. The major 
difference is that most people think of only the mass-market paperback as a &bdquo;pa-
perback.&permil; The emphasis on popular, previously published titles issued in new and 
colorful covers and sold at a low price is apparent. Those are the elements of the pa-
perback revolution, not the paper cover or even the relatively compact form. Nor has 
the paperback created a whole new group of readers, as some overenthusiastic writers 
claim. It has merely tapped an existing market for low-cost, popular books. 
</p>
<p> Contrary to popular belief, using a paper cover rather than a hard cover does not 
reduce the unit cost of a book by any significant amount. Original paperbacks incur 
the same costs, except for the cover material, as a hardcover title, which is why their 
cost is so much higher than that of reprint paperbacks. The reason the price of paper-
backs is so much lower than hardcovers is that most first appeared as hardcovers. The 
title already sold well in hardcover, or there would be no reason to bring out a paper 
version, so the book has probably already shown a profit. This means the publisher 
has already recovered almost all of the major production costs, thus making it possi-
ble to reduce the price. In addition, releasing a paperback version of a hardcover title 
allows the publisher to benefit from marketing efforts expended on the hardcover ver-
sion. Marketing efforts for the hardcover carry over to the paperback, which further </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>134 7&mdash;Print and Digital Books
</p>
<p>reduces publishing costs. Economies of scale, or high sales volume and low per-unit 
profits, also reduce the price. Discounts for original titles in paperback are similar to 
those for hardbacks, while mass-market discounts tend to be higher. 
</p>
<p>  Small presses  are important for some libraries. Some people, including librarians 
think of small presses as literary presses. Anyone reading the annual &bdquo;Small Press 
Round-Up&permil; in  Library Journal  could reasonably reach the same conclusion. The real-
ity is that small presses are as diverse as the international publishing conglomerates. 
Size is the only real difference; in functions and interests small presses are no differ-
ent from large trade publishers. 
</p>
<p> A good guide to the output of small presses is  Small Press Record of Books in 
Print  ( SPRBIP,  Dust books). The  SPRBIP  is the definitive record of books in print by 
the small-press industry, listing more than 40,000 titles from more than 4,600 small, 
independent, educational and self-publishers worldwide and is available on a CD-ROM 
(http://www.dustbooks.com/sr.htm). Many small presses are one-person operations, a 
sideline from the publisher&Ecirc;s home. Such presses seldom publish more than four titles 
per year. The listings in  SPRBIP  show the broad range of subject interests of small 
presses and that there are both book and periodical presses in this category. Some 
people assume that the content of small-press publications is poor. This is incorrect, 
for small presses do not produce proportionally, any more poor-quality titles than do 
the large publishers. Often, it is only through the small press that one can find infor-
mation on less popular topics. 
</p>
<p> Another factor that sets small presses apart from their larger counterparts is eco-
nomics. Large publishers have high costs and need substantial sales to recover their 
costs, but small presses can produce a book for a limited market at a reasonable cost 
and still expect some profit. Small presses can also produce books more quickly than 
their larger counterparts. 
</p>
<p> From an acquisitions point of view, small presses represent a challenge. Tracking 
down new releases can present a variety of problems. Locating a correct current ad-
dress is one common problem. Another is learning about a small-press title before it 
goes out of print.  SPRBIP  tries to provide current information. However, waiting for 
the annual  SPRBIP  may take too long, because small presses frequently move about 
and their press runs are small, that is, only a limited quantity of books are printed. 
</p>
<p> Acquisitions departments interested in small presses have had some commercial 
help. Quality Books, Inc. (a vendor that in the past was known primarily as a source 
of remainder books) has become active in the distribution of small-press publica-
tions. Although it stocks books from only a small percentage of the presses listed in 
 SPRBIP  (about one-fifth), the fact that it does stock the items is a major feature. Like 
most other distributors, it has a Web presence (http://www.quality-books.com/). 
</p>
<p>  Serial  (newspaper and periodical)  publishers  are a different class of publisher. 
Usually, book publishers depend on persons outside their organization to write the 
material they publish. Newspaper and periodical publishers have staff reporters or 
writers. Of course, there are exceptions to the exception. For instance, some popular 
(and most scholarly) periodicals consist of articles written by persons not employed 
by the organization that publishes the journal. In general, in newspaper or periodical 
publishing, one finds the same range of activities found in book publishing. In other 
words, there are commercial publishers of popular materials, specialty publishers, 
children&Ecirc;s publishers, scholarly or academic publishers, and government publishers. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Electronic Publishing 135
</p>
<p>All subcategories share the characteristics of their book publishing counterparts, and 
some are divisions of book publishing organizations. 
</p>
<p>  Publishers/distributors  are an important part of the publishing industry in Canada. 
Because Canada&Ecirc;s small population is stretched over a very large country, distribution 
costs are higher and production runs are lower than in the United States. Many Cana-
dian publishers, such as Thomas Allen and Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside, also function as 
distributors or agents of foreign publishers to supplement their publishing activities. A 
list of Canadian publishers is found in  Canadian Publishers Directory,  published semi-
annually by International Press Publications, Inc. (http://www.ippbooks.com/store/). 
</p>
<p> ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING 
</p>
<p> There is no doubt that the world of publishing has changed and will continue to 
change as a result of technology. Like libraries, technology has caused producers to 
adjust and change the way they conduct their day-to-day activities, but at present the 
underlying functions remain stable. In many ways, what has taken place in publishing 
over the past 20-plus years is rather similar to the events that occurred in the 1440s 
with the invention of the printing press. Just as it took time for the printing press to 
become the transforming force of Western European society, so it will take time for 
us to realize the full potential of e-publishing. As noted by Jenkins: 
</p>
<p> E-books are considered the third wave of electronic publishing. The first wave 
included the conversion of indices from secondary publishers to searchable 
online databases such as Dialog developed in the 1970s. The second wave 
came when the internet became popular and journals began converting ar-
ticles to Portable Document Format (PDF) and including Standard General-
ized Markup Language (SGML) to allowing users to link out to references 
for further study. E-books followed providing many of the benefits of their 
earlier counterparts, particularly 24/7 remote access. 4  
</p>
<p> Two major factors about the two technologies have had implications for society. 
First, both technologies changed the manner in which people communicate with one 
another and the speed of the process. Second, both technologies also generated un-
intended consequences; none of the 15th-century printers foresaw what having more 
and more people able to read, write, and communicate would mean. Societies change 
along with their changing circumstances; however, in general, societies make adjust-
ments rather slowly with something of a trial-and-error modifications process. Unlike 
the printing press in Western Europe, the digital revolution is a worldwide phenom-
enon. That in turn means a host of societies are attempting to assimilate the electronic 
environment and the speed with which people can and do communicate around the 
world. We are in the very early stages of what will probably be a very different world 
years from now. 
</p>
<p> Publishers still find the Web world something of a challenge and are struggling 
to find a satisfactory manner to use it and generate an adequate income stream to 
remain profitable. Some have tried issuing &bdquo;born digital&permil; titles (material not first re-
leased in a paper format) with less than great success. Most can offer other firms, such </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>136 7&mdash;Print and Digital Books
</p>
<p>as Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble, e-versions of titles they release in paper. Finding 
the proper pricing structure for this approach is still very much up in the air. Per-
haps the type of e-readers on market in 2010 and beyond (such as Amazon&Ecirc;s Kindle, 
Sony Reader, and Barnes &amp; Noble&Ecirc;s Nook) will overcome the proprietary issues that 
caused earlier e-readers to fail. 
</p>
<p> E-Readers 
</p>
<p> While it has certainly been possible for some time to read and review books on 
laptop and desktop computer Web browsers through such services as NetLibrary, per-
sonal e-readers are becoming more and more popular as a convenient means of access-
ing e-titles. The current generation of e-readers will likely have greater staying power 
than their earlier predecessors, in part because there will continue to be a steady and 
varied supply of titles to download given the companies now offering the hardware. 
There is also a strong probability that the current single-function units will morph in 
some manner with the existing multifunction cell phones and MP3 players. 
</p>
<p> For libraries, e-readers present some new challenges for service models and ac-
quisitions budgets. First, there is a question of just how many individuals will be 
willing to pay the cost for an electronic device that is a single-function proprietary de-
vice? Many librarians will remember the days when the VHS and Beta videocassettes 
competed for dominance&middot;a battle that lasted for many years with Beta finally the 
loser. However, before the battle was over many libraries had invested considerable 
sums in acquiring Beta cassettes. Although the situation is somewhat different today, 
there is still the memory of what happened with the video formats and what happened 
to libraries that jumped on the e-reader bandwagon after the first e-readers came on 
the market not too long ago. 
</p>
<p> Assuming that a library does consider entering into a service related to the new 
e-readers, there are still questions regarding which platforms to support, how much 
money to commit to the service, whether users should pay some or all of the costs, 
and perhaps most importantly how to handle the increased workload (see below 
for examples) that e-readers would create for the staff. Also, libraries must decide 
whether or not to try to address both types of e-books. There are digitized e-books 
that libraries can provide access to online and there are titles intended for download-
ing onto a reader. In 2007, Connaway and Wicht reported that e-books represented 
only 5 percent of academic library collections, just over 2 percent of public library 
collections and between 15 and 60 percent of special library collections. Most of the 
holdings were for e-titles made available online rather than downloaded to a reader. 5  
As identified by Connaway and Wicht, there are currently at least four barriers to 
widespread library adaptation of e-books: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Lack of standards for software and hardware 
 &bull; Usage rights (single user) tend go against libraries&Ecirc; operating philosophy 
</p>
<p>(open access) 
 &bull; Pricing models are rather unrealistic for library budgets, especially during 
</p>
<p>lean economic times 
 &bull; Lack of a library-based discovery system (titles are currently available only 
</p>
<p>through online public access catalogs [OPACs] that for young users do not 
match the ease of use of Google and Yahoo). </p>

<p>Technology and Information Producers 137
</p>
<p> So far, as of late 2010, efforts to get e-readers into the education market have 
been more or less a research and development activity than one geared to market 
penetration. Anne Behler reported on a joint project between Sony and the Penn State 
University Libraries to test 100 of Sony&Ecirc;s e-book readers for general-use lending 
and in classroom settings. 6  One of the libraries&Ecirc; issues was that the Sony Reader 
is designed for a single user, or at best a family (the usage terms are for no more 
than five readers for a single download)&middot;which represent serious cost and workload 
considerations. The project&Ecirc;s major finding, in terms of library usage, was that &bdquo;Un-
fortunately, the current hardware dependent-technology model is not scalable to a 
larger academic setting, particularly a library-supported one.&permil; 7  One of the significant 
factors in reaching that conclusion, and one that seems applicable to any size library, 
was the considerable staff time that was required to create numerous separate logins, 
passwords, and alias e-mail accounts, and to load books onto e-readers. The e-readers 
did not fare much better in the classroom setting. 
</p>
<p> E-resources present something of a conundrum for publishers and libraries. As 
Algenio and Thompson-Young noted, &bdquo;Publishers want to sell books to customers 
and libraries want to lend books to users. E-books challenge both of these goals, since 
one e-book could be accessed by multiple library users at a time or could be protected 
by software that requires payment per view.&permil; 8  Just how e-readers and library service 
will play out is impossible to accurately predict; however, libraries have effectively 
dealt with a variety of information-delivery systems in the past and they will likely 
do so again. 
</p>
<p> TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION PRODUCERS 
</p>
<p> As was true of promises of cost savings from using technology in libraries, pro-
ducers have  not  found that technology has reduced their cost of doing business. Per-
haps part of the reason for not realizing cost savings is that the producers have not 
modified their approach to doing business. However, just as libraries found that they 
did not save money through the use of technology but were able to do more with ex-
isting resources, publishers are finding it possible to do more without increasing their 
personnel. For both producers and consumers the question is, &bdquo;What is the correct 
balance between traditional and electronics at what cost?&permil; 
</p>
<p> One area where the expected cost savings for consumers has not materialized 
is college textbooks. The Digital Scholarship and Publishing Center noted that de-
spite student and faculty hopes, e-textbooks have not actually reduced end-user&Ecirc;s 
expenses: 
</p>
<p> Publishers&Ecirc; electronic textbooks do tend to cost less than the print versions, 
but the lower initial cost can be deceiving. Because publishers maintain con-
trol over digital textbooks, they can restrict how they are used and distrib-
uted. A student using an electronic textbook cannot sell that book back to 
the bookstore to recoup some of the cost, nor can other students buy cheaper 
versions of electronic texts. A 2008 study by the Student Public Interest Re-
search Group found that on average, electronic textbooks cost the same as 
print versions bought and sold back to the bookstore. 9  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>138 7&mdash;Print and Digital Books
</p>
<p> One factor that makes digital formats a success lies in the capability to quickly 
search vast quantities of text such as via Project Gutenberg and Pandora or via a 
commercial database like  American Poetry Database.  Another major plus for digital 
materials is having full-text journal articles available online. Speed, search ability, 
and remote access are the primary pluses of digital. On the other hand, costs and 
preservation are long-term concerns regarding digital formats that must be addressed 
by libraries&middot;usually by technical services and/or information technology staff. Costs 
such as encoding (e.g., SGML, XTML) large files to increase search ability, and is-
sues of long-term maintenance of the digital material, intellectual property rights, and 
data accuracy and integrity are among the more pressing issues facing libraries when 
it comes to digital materials. 
</p>
<p> As attractive as e-resources have become, some sense of the staying power of 
print is found in such sources as  Books in Print . A check of booksinprint.com   in late 
2009 indicated that there were more than 7.5 million English language titles in the da-
tabase. (Note: These numbers are based on unique International Standard Book Num-
bers [ISBNs]; thus, many titles would be double-counted if there were both hardcover 
and paper versions in print. Some popular titles might even be triple-counted, if there 
an audio version were also available.) Certainly, electronic products are being pro-
duced, but as of late 2009 they had not noticeably displaced the production of print 
materials. The 2003&ndash;2004 edition of  Books in Print  listed 203,000  new  titles; Darnton 
noted that 976,000 new books were released worldwide in 2007. 10  
</p>
<p> ACQUISITIONS AND E-RESOURCES 
</p>
<p> Acquisition of e-resources presents some significant differences from their paper 
counterparts. From a distribution perspective, there are three sources for e-materials&middot;
directly from the publisher (e.g., ABC-CLIO&Ecirc;s eBook Collection at http://www.abc-
clio.com/ProductTours/Default.aspx?tourid=18), from a vendor for e-publishers (e.g., 
EBSCO&Ecirc;s Electronic Book Collections, at http://www2.ebsco.com/en-us/ProductsSer 
vices/ebooks/Pages/index.aspx), and from an e-book database (e.g., ebrary, at http://
www.ebrary.com/corp/). No matter how the material is distributed, libraries must work 
through such issues as what type of reading software is required and what access model 
the distributor imposes. Realistically, ordering is handled directly from either the pub-
lisher or the e-book vendor. Since 2007, many publishers and e-vendors have been 
partnering with paper-based library book vendors to better market their products; two 
examples are NetLibrary (http://www.netlibrary.com/) partnering with OCLC, and 
EBook Library (EBL; http://www.eblib.com/?p=about) partnering with both publishers 
and distributors. A comprehensive article surveying the e-book vendor landscape and 
worth reviewing is by Vasileiou, Hartley, and Rowley, 11  who present key characteristics 
of 20 major e-book companies&middot;both publishers and aggregators. 
</p>
<p> Without question, the biggest difference between print and digital book acquisi-
tion lies in what the library receives for the monies paid. &bdquo;Purchased&permil; is generally 
an inappropriate term for the digital book acquisition process. More often than not 
the e-vendor will initially offer what amounts to a lease to have access to the mate-
rial under consideration. The agreement typically allows access only for as long as 
the library pays fees, and the library loses access should it have to cancel what is a </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Google Books Library Project 139
</p>
<p>form of subscription. (There are two major types of e-resources&middot;serials and books/
reports/government documents. For reports and government documents, access is 
often free and online. Serials and e-books generally require payment before access is 
available.) 
</p>
<p> Early successes in e-resources, from the producers&Ecirc; point-of-view, were with se-
rials. For the producers, the paper-based subscription pricing models worked well and 
because of that early success they have moved over into the developing e-book arena. 
(We will explore the issues of licensing and negotiation in the serials chapter.) A few 
e-vendors do offer packages that become a permanent part of the library&Ecirc;s collection 
after payment; however, that practice is not all that widespread yet. At the time this 
volume was prepared only two e-vendors offered perpetual multiple-user packages: 
Books 24&ndash;7 (http://books24-7.com/en/) and the aforementioned EBL. Similarly, three 
firms offered a single-user perpetual package&middot;EBL, ebrary, and NetLibrary. As you 
might expect, the various packages have very different costs and conditions, which 
makes the coordination between collection development and acquisitions personnel 
very important. Silberer and Bass suggested that in terms of perpetual e-book pricing 
that, &bdquo;the future of this type of pricing is probably cover price plus a premium for mul-
tiple users and perpetual ownership (i.e., 1.25 or 1.50 times the list price plus access 
fees based on FTE.&permil; 12  (FTE is a reference to full-time equivalent and a reflection of an 
academic library environment.) Another pricing option for which whose popularity 
and durability remains to be seen is patron-driven acquisition. Sue Polanka describes 
this approach in her 2009 article, &bdquo;Off the Shelf: Patron-Driven Acquisition.&permil; 13  
</p>
<p> THE GOOGLE BOOKS LIBRARY PROJECT 
</p>
<p> Electronic collections are not limited to those purchased from commercial ven-
dors for viewing on e-readers or via Web browsers. As noted by Kovacs and Robin-
son, &bdquo;Some digital collections are preservation projects designed to ensure that fragile 
historical materials are available for future generations. Libraries participate in many 
local history projects and preservation projects.&permil; 14  Two examples of such collections 
include the American Memory project, sponsored by the Library of Congress (http://
memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html), and Digital Collections@UM at the University 
of Maryland Libraries (http://www.lib.umd.edu/digital/). However, there is one digiti-
zation project that has gained far more press and attention than any other: the Google 
Books Library Project (http://books.google.com). 
</p>
<p> Although at the time we prepared this edition the final outcome of Google Books 
Library Project had not been decide by the courts, we believe it will exist in some 
form and thus should be covered. The project started around 2003 when Google ap-
proached the Library of Congress with a proposal to digitize all the books in the 
library. When the Library of Congress offered a counterproposal that would only 
include public domain (i.e., those no longer covered by copyright) books, Google did 
not follow up. Rather, Google turned to other major research libraries, such as those at 
the University of Michigan, Oxford University, and Harvard University, and the New 
York Public Library with some success. 
</p>
<p> The notion that a company would be allowed to make digital copies of copy-
righted works got the attention of many rights holders who sued Google in 2005. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>140 7&mdash;Print and Digital Books
</p>
<p>The case was complex and took until October 28, 2008, before a proposed settlement 
was reached. (An overview of the settlement is available from the American Library 
Association Washington Office Web site: http://wo.ala.org/gbs/. Google&Ecirc;s report on 
the settlement may be viewed at http://books.google.com/googlebooks/agreement/.) 
What Google has been doing is scanning material and creating an electronic index 
available free of charge to users to search the database. In the case of public-domain 
items, users may view or download the entire text. Copyrighted works are available 
in small segments, which Google offers as downloadable files for a fee in the case 
of &bdquo;orphan works&permil; (copyrighted works that are still covered, but owner of rights not 
located) and copyrighted works that are not commercially available. The settlement 
had not yet been approved by a federal judge as of late 2010. 
</p>
<p> An article in the September 5, 2009, issue of the  Economist  reported, &bdquo;Now 
Google and its former antagonists are seeking judicial approval for the deal they 
reached last year to settle the class-action suit. Among other things, this would allow 
the company to scan millions of out-of-print books, including orphan works, with-
out seeking permission from individual copyright holders.&permil; 15  As part of the settle-
ment, Google would set aside funds from sales of digitized works in a special fund 
(a &bdquo;book-rights registry&permil;) to presumably pay copyright holders a share of the sales 
income. One impact of the agreement between Google and the research libraries be 
to &bdquo;in effect create a legally sanctioned cartel for digital-book rights that could artifi-
cially inflate the price of library subscriptions.&permil; 16  
</p>
<p> Marybeth Peters, U.S. Register of Copyright, in a statement to the U.S. House 
of Representatives Judiciary Committee on September 10, 2009, noted that, &bdquo;Under 
the proposed settlement, the parties have crafted a class that is not anchored to past 
or imminent scanning, but instead turns on the much broader question of whether a 
work was  published  by January 5, 2009. As defined, the class would allow Google to 
continue to scan entire libraries, for commercial gain, into the indefinite future. The 
settlement would bind authors, publishers, their heirs and successors to these rules, 
even though Google has not yet scanned, and may never scan their works.&permil; 17  
</p>
<p> It should come as no surprise that authors and publishers voiced great displeasure 
about the proposed settlement as they were not part of the settlement process nor were 
they contacted in any manner. Other countries put forward strong objections as well, 
and by September 2009, Google, at a hearing convened by the European Commis-
sion to attempt to answer some of the European concerns, reported that it had already 
digitized 10 million books both public domain and copyrighted books (without the 
copyright owners specific permission). 18  
</p>
<p> How will the Google project affect libraries in the long term? That remains to be 
seen. (A reminder, the courts had yet to rule on the settlement when this book went to 
press, and the courts can accept or reject any part, or all of, the proposed agreement. 
Thus, what follows is based on what is in the settlement as it stands.) 
</p>
<p> On the &bdquo;good for society&permil; side, the digitized materials will be searchable using the 
Google search software&middot;providing searching depth that is impossible in a paper ver-
sion without great expense. It means that anyone with a computer who can connect to 
Google will, for the present, have free access to a wealth of information that has been 
vetted by the standard quality-control process of publishing, unlike the content that 
anyone can post on the Web without regard for accuracy. Teskey went so far as to iden-
tify three possible negative impacts, should the settlement and project ultimately fail: </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Summary 141
</p>
<p> (1) Publishers and authors will forfeit a major opportunity to create new 
commercial value for millions of out-of-print books. (2) There will be a con-
tinuing &bdquo;chill&permil; for organizations or institutions planning digitization proj-
ects, and possible lawsuits if one includes an orphan work by mistake. 
(3) Those with print disabilities lose the promise of a vast accessible digital 
collection. 19  
</p>
<p> There several components to the service side of the proposal (free service for 
all users, fee-based service for all users, free public-access service for public librar-
ies and not-for-profit academic institutions, and institutional subscriptions). The &bdquo;at 
present&permil; aspect previously mentioned is particularly noteworthy as Google clearly 
expects to generate a revenue stream from more than posting advertisements on the 
displayed pages. The public-access service component will be available to public and 
nonprofit academic libraries/institutions upon request on a one-terminal basis. A pub-
lic library system would be allowed one such terminal in each building in its system. 
Academic libraries would be eligible for terminals based on institutional full-time 
equivalent employees. Although the settlement mentions the possibility of free or fee-
based expansion beyond one terminal, it does not address when or at what cost such 
expansion might occur. (Note: Schools [kindergarten through12th grade] and special 
libraries are not mentioned in the settlement.) 
</p>
<p> What could a person do at a free library-based Google terminal? All the books in 
the institutional subscription database would be viewable. The institutional subscrip-
tion database would include all public domain and all copyrighted, but not commer-
cially available titles. Users could print pages from the title at a reasonable per-page 
charge, the rate to be set by Google in conjunction with its partners. Users could not 
cut-and-paste text from the material. With an institutional subscription, the user could 
do all of this and could cut and paste up to four pages at a time and thereby, using 
multiple cut-and-paste operations, copy the entire title. Similarly, a person could use 
multiple commands to print the entire text. 
</p>
<p> Clearly, the project would have a marked impact on library retrospective collec-
tion development. It is rather unclear what the drafters of agreement had in mind by 
the phrase &bdquo;not commercially available.&permil; Are books for sale by out-of-print dealers 
commercially available? It seems the dealers would say so, and much of their stock 
consists of titles that are in the public domain. There is no indication that there was 
anyone from that field at the table when the proposed settlement was reached in 2005. 
The bottom line is that we will have to await the court&Ecirc;s judgment before we can 
realistically assess the impact of the project on library services, library budgets, and 
acquisitions activities. Associated Press reported on November 10, 2009, that &bdquo;The 
Justice department has warned it would probably try to block the current agreement 
from taking effect because antitrust regulators had concluded it threatened to thwart 
competition and drive up prices.&permil; 20  
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> Today, with products like Kindle, Sony Reader, and Barnes and Noble&Ecirc;s Nook, 
many people read both paper-based and e-books, subscribe to paper-based magazines, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>142 7&mdash;Print and Digital Books
</p>
<p>read full-text journal articles through library databases, and buy or have home-delivered 
newspapers while also occasionally checking the news on the Internet. In other words, 
people make use of both formats depending upon physical circumstance and need. Just 
as radio did not destroy newspapers and television did not kill motion pictures, both 
print and digital information formats will likely coexist for some time to come. 
</p>
<p> This chapter briefly outlined the history and development of publishers that pro-
duce the materials libraries acquire, catalog, and process to create the collections for 
their user communities. It described how these businesses function and some of the 
major types of material they produce. It also noted how the various types of busi-
nesses differ and how those differences affect the cost of the materials acquired. It 
provided some background about the nature and issues related to producers efforts to 
remain viable in an ever-growing digital environment , and reviewed the background 
of the Google Books Library Project, a case all librarians should monitor, not just 
those in technical services. 
</p>

<p>8     E-Resource Issues 
</p>
<p> One major factor differentiating electronic from printed information is the 
shift from product to service. 
</p>

</p>
<p> The exchange of a print license tends to be initiated by the vendor. Since it 
already reflects the vendor&Ecirc;s business model, it is up to the library to negoti-
ate for the terms that meet the library&Ecirc;s requirements.

<p> Many experienced librarian negotiators agree: one of the biggest mistakes li-
brarians make is underestimating the power they hold as possible negotiators.

<p> Chapter 7 concluded with some coverage of e-books and a brief discussion of some 
issues related to e-resources in general. In this chapter, we take a more in-depth look 
at how e-collection development differs from paper-based collecting and the general 
implications for acquisitions activities. E-collections are becoming an increasing per-
centage of a library&Ecirc;s collections. 
</p>
<p> It has taken centuries for libraries to create a reasonably effective system for han-
dling print resources. When audiovisual materials (such as recorded music and videos) 
became widely available to the public, it took some years for such items to become 
standard features in library collections. E-resources seem to have gone from a dream 
to an essential element in a library&Ecirc;s service program in a flash. That adoption speed 
still causes some confusion for the library staff and users. The field is still working on 
how to create a highly effective, cost-efficient, and seamlessly integrated information </p>

</p>
<p>collection. The number of resources that have become available electronically has grown 
exponentially in the recent past. However, the time may not yet be right for an &bdquo;e-only&permil; 
library. For a discussion of an e-only initiative attempted by the Stanford University 
Meyer Library, see Johanna Drucker&Ecirc;s &bdquo;Blind Spots&permil; article, in the April 3, 2009, issue 
of the  Chronicle of Higher Education.  1  
</p>
<p> What constitutes a library&Ecirc;s e-resource collection? An e-collection might consist of 
a core set of databases, a collection of links to Web sites embedded in OPAC records, 
and one or more terminals connected to service sites. The most familiar component is a 
core of databases usually containing full-text journal articles (Proquest, and EBSCOHost 
are two examples). E-books (NetLibrary is one such vendor) and &bdquo;born digital&permil; journals 
(     portal: The Library and the Academy  is one example) and books are another element of 
library e-collections. Embedded Web site links may be to service sites such as Ancestry 
Plus   or to information sites like the OCLC&Ecirc;s WorldCat or Kelly&Ecirc;s Blue Book .  At some 
point in the near future there is likely to be a dedicated terminal for Google Books in 
most public and academic libraries (at the time this chapter was being prepared there was 
no clear indication that school libraries would be part of the Google settlement). 
</p>
<p> DIFFERENCES BETWEEN E-RESOURCE 
AND PRINT COLLECTION BUILDING 
</p>
<p> There are several differences between how selection and acquisition decisions are 
made when it comes to e-resources. Selection of these resources builds on the criteria 
used when selecting paper-based titles. The quality of the material, such as accuracy, 
currency, and usability, are just as much factors for e-resources as they are for print 
items. E-resources must also reflect the information needs and wants of the library&Ecirc;s 
service community. Both require at least some cost-benefit consideration. Maintaining 
subject/topical balance is equally important for both formats. There are, however, some 
significant differences, which we will cover in the next few sections. 
</p>
<p> Ownership Issues 
</p>
<p> Perhaps the most significant difference between a print and an e-resource is that 
a library rarely owns a physical product for the e-material. Rather, it has access rights. 
Many, if not most, e-resource products are only available through a license. The stan-
dard license for a product often contains some limitations regarding access and usage 
of the material, which can be problematic for the library. 
</p>
<p> Some of the issues that arise are (1) restrictions that may limit or forbid the use of 
the content for interlibrary lending, (2) limits on the number of individuals who may ac-
cess the material at the same time (simultaneous users), (3) restrictions on the use of the 
material by nonlibrary cardholders (any user group not identified as part of the license), 
(4) availability of remote access (proxy server issues and in-library usage), and (5) even 
restrictions making the library liable for how an individual makes use of the information 
gathered after leaving the building. Depending on the content of the license, the library 
may wish to negotiate with the vendor regarding such limitations. 
</p>
<p> The license is a legal document, and institutional attorneys may have to become 
involved in the negotiations. Some libraries have at least considered, if they have not </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Differences between E-Resource and Print Collection Building 147
</p>
<p>actually done so, spending funds on having the library&Ecirc;s legal counsel draw up a basic 
license that reflects the library&Ecirc;s starting point for the negotiations. Mark Watson ex-
plored the question of whether a library needs a legal consultant to address licensing 
issues. He said, &bdquo;It is simply a fact of licensing life that where librarians care about the 
content, interface, or ability to perform interlibrary loan, the lawyers are looking for 
assurance that the university will not be subject to unlimited indemnification provi-
sions, or that obligations for attorney fees will be subject to the limitations and condi-
tions of the state constitution. . . . To sum up, I think the forces shaping our libraries 
today make employing a library lawyer a good, forward thinking idea.&permil; 2  
</p>
<p> There are three basic types of licenses for digital products libraries are interested 
in making available to their users. First, there is the compulsory agreement. Under such 
licenses a library, after accepting the contract, may use the material freely as long as 
it pays any associated fees and complies with copyright regulations. Shrink-wrapped 
licenses are familiar to anyone who has purchased a software package from a store (in 
an online transaction, it is called a &bdquo;click-on&permil; agreement or license). The first two types 
are not negotiable; the third type is negotiable and is the type associated with the vast 
majority of digital material of interest to libraries. 
</p>
<p> Negotiating the License 
</p>
<p> The concept of negotiating a license may seem daunting. However, it is important 
to remember that everyone negotiates every day, even if they do not realize they are 
doing so. If nothing else, one interacts with family members and coworkers, and brings 
both parties to agreement over everything from who waters the office plants to who 
prepares dinner. This is negotiation in action, and as Jill Grogg wrote, we participate in 
a &bdquo;myriad of negotiations that each of us conducts every day&middot;in both our professional 
and our personal lives.&permil; 3  She also noted that for many librarians, negotiations fall into 
the category of business activities in which they would rather not have to engage. Fur-
ther, she commented that &bdquo;If librarians felt more comfortable with the specifics of con-
tract law, copyright, and intellectual property as well as with negotiation in general, we 
would be better stewards for our resources and better representatives for our users.&permil; 4  
</p>
<p> Negotiation is about resolving a matter in such a way that all parties involved achieve 
some gain rather than all or nothing. The &bdquo;I Win! You Lose!&permil; approach (also known as 
zero-sum outcomes) is not what is needed if libraries and vendors are to succeed in 
achieving their long-term goals. What are a few of the most common goals for libraries 
and vendors to achieve in the negotiation process? 
</p>
<p> Library Goals 
</p>
<p> &bull; Secure the highest-quality content appropriate for its service community. 
 &bull; Ensure reliable/stable electronic access. 
 &bull; Expend available funds as prudently as possible. 
 &bull; Provide maximum usage rights for the service population. 
 &bull; Reduce staffing costs associated with the product&Ecirc;s usage as much as 
</p>
<p>possible. 
 &bull; Avoid any limitations on existing or traditional services (such as inter-
</p>
<p>library loan). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>148 8&mdash;E-Resource Issues
</p>
<p> Vendor Goals 
</p>
<p> &bull; Realize a maximum profit from its products. 
 &bull; Improve or expand its products. 
 &bull; Protect its intellectual property rights and content. 
 &bull; Offer products that customers want and need. 
 &bull; Retain a satisfied customer base. 
 &bull; Secure positive customer recommendations through quality customer ser-
</p>
<p>vice and support. 
</p>
<p> To have a mutually beneficial negotiation, certain elements must be present on both 
sides of the negotiation table. First and foremost, there should be no hidden agendas. 
There must be open and honest exchanges of information regarding the party&Ecirc;s posi-
tions. Everyone must be willing to listen and learn what the other side&Ecirc;s views are and 
make serious efforts to understand those positions. If everyone can maintain control of 
what they know are their hot-button statements or words, the prospect for a good reso-
lution is greatly improved. Finally, and most important, there must be a willingness to 
compromise; having a set of &bdquo;never change&permil; positions may well lead to an impasse. 
</p>
<p> Group Decision Making 
</p>
<p> Another significant difference between print and e-resource acquisitions decisions 
is that many, if not most, libraries employ a team or committee to select e-materials. 
This approach is necessary as there are both technical and content issues to think about 
and very often the product under consideration contains multiple titles that frequently 
cut across disciplines. Brian Quinn made the point that &bdquo;Decisions regarding titles that 
represent a substantial investment, such as databases, or that involve an ongoing invest-
ment, such as subscriptions to journals, are commonly made in a group context. Impor-
tant collection development decisions are made by groups whose members often consist 
of various stakeholders . . . all of whom are involved in developing the collection.&permil; 5  
For the newcomer to the process, having an understanding of the library and its service 
community can be vital to being an effective advocate for a position to acquire or not 
acquire a product or title. 
</p>
<p> When it comes to library collections, the decision-making process can have three 
stakeholders&middot;personal selection decisions, internal groups (selection committees and 
teams), and/or external groups (such as consortia). Although most of the basic elements 
of personal decision-making (such as risk and uncertainty) also apply to group decision-
making, several special group-process issues are also in play. If anything, group 
decision-making is even more complex than personal decision-making. Many e-resource 
decisions are a combination of two group decisions&middot;an internal group and an external 
group or consortium in which the individual library has but one voice or vote. It is 
also a situation in which the external decision may override or change local desires or 
decisions. 
</p>
<p> One important aspect of group decisions is how the group views the process&middot;is 
the group searching for the best answer or trying to make the case for a particular deci-
sion. While this process is a factor for individual decisions, it becomes critical in the 
group setting, especially when there is both an internal and external decision involved. 
When a group views the process as advocacy, there is often a sense of competition to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Differences between E-Resource and Print Collection Building 149
</p>
<p>see whose view will prevail. Such an atmosphere does not lend itself to sound decision 
making or at least not a decision that is very rapid. Strong views or values and hidden 
agendas get in the way of meaningful and open exchanges. 
</p>
<p> Groups can easily fall into the trap of groupthink. Two factors frequently play a 
role in groupthink. Perhaps the most common is the desire to keep the process moving 
along. This often results in a too quick decision without much effort to develop, much 
less assess, multiple options. The second common factor is the desire to be a team player; 
this too can reduce options and very likely limit thoughtful critical assessment or idea 
generation. (A good article that provides guidance on group and team decision-making 
is H. Frank Cervone, &bdquo;Making Decisions: Methods for Digital Library Project Teams,&permil; 
 OCLC Systems &amp; Services  21, no. 1 [2005]: 30&ndash;35.) 
</p>
<p> Libraries increasingly face consortial decision-making in terms of full-text journal 
databases. While all the above elements and issues are in play, some other issues further 
complicate the matter. First, and foremost, unlike internal group decisions there is rarely 
a single person in charge of the decision (which is especially important in the case of an 
impasse). Thus, accountability is very vague at best. Also, a library&Ecirc;s choices for action 
are limited when it comes to consortial decisions&middot;reject, accept, accept and hope for 
the best, fight to change the decision, or go on alone. 
</p>
<p> Generally, consortia decisions are ones in which two Cs&middot;concessions and con-
sensus&middot;are key factors in the final outcome. Another C for consortial decision-making 
is consideration&middot;a library may not always get what it would like, if the group is to 
succeed. A final C, one that is often the most significant, is the presence or absence of 
coalitions. In many ways, the existence of coalitions can help move matters forward 
as coalitions normally reduce the number of variables in play with a large group. 
</p>
<p> A major challenge for such groups is determining what is best. The number of bests 
is substantially greater in a consortial environment than for a single library. There are the 
bests for each institution, the bests for coalitions, and, of course, the bests for the group 
as a whole. 
</p>
<p> Building trust is always a factor in group decision-making, but it becomes more of 
a challenge for consortial members as they have less time together than individuals who 
work together on a daily (or even monthly) basis. Time is a key factor in creating trust 
and it is in limited supply in such situations. A related factor is that, more often than not, 
institutional representatives at such meetings are a senior, if not the senior, manager. 
Generally, such people are not used to having their ideas or views openly challenged, 
as may happen in a consortial setting. Time together, trust, concessions, and consensus 
are the key elements for successful consortial decision-making. (An outstanding article, 
if complex for those uncomfortable with qualitative methods, is Robert M. Hayes, &bdquo;Co-
operative Game Theoretic Models for Decision-Making in the Context of Library Co-
operation,&permil;  Library Trends  51, no. 3 [2003]: 441&ndash;61.) 
</p>
<p> Trials 
</p>
<p> For many of the e-products that libraries consider making available to their users, 
there is a trial period before a final agreement is implemented. There are several rea-
sons for this: 
</p>
<p> &bull; The relatively high cost of e-products 
 &bull; The variety of search techniques available from vendor to vendor </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>150 8&mdash;E-Resource Issues
</p>
<p> &bull; The actual content of the database or product 
 &bull; The ease of use in terms of staff and users 
 &bull; The technical requirements that need to be met to make the product avail-
</p>
<p>able given a library&Ecirc;s infrastructure. 
</p>
<p> In one sense, the trial is somewhat like the approval process for books. The library staff 
and users are able to take the product for an extended test drive. Often the trial is for 
consortial members only and involves strict time limits. The final acquisition decision 
may rest on what the membership as a whole decides. Thus, not only do the local staff 
members have an opinion, but so do other libraries and the local service community. As 
one might guess, this can add complexity to making a decision for individual libraries. 
</p>
<p> Purchase Price 
</p>
<p> To some degree, acquiring access to an e-resource is akin to purchasing a new car. 
At the outset, the library is not certain what the purchase price will be. Certainly, like 
a new automobile, there is a suggested retail price; however, just as with a new car the 
suggested retail price is rarely the final price. If the vendor is a firm with which the 
library has done a substantial amount of business over a number of years, there may be 
a discount for the library going it alone. When the library is part of a consortia the final 
price is often not settled until well after the trial period ends. 
</p>
<p> Two major factors cause the consortial price to vary. One factor is that the final 
price may be dependent upon the number of members who decide to participate in the 
deal. Generally, the more members that join, the lower the per-library price becomes. 
Based on the authors&Ecirc; experience, getting to the final cost may take several months. For 
example, a library that initially thought it did not want the product because of budget 
constraints learns that the cost is dropping as more libraries sign on and decides it would 
like to acquire access as well. That in turn may cause the vendor to recalculate the 
price&middot;it almost always results in a lower figure but does extend the timeline. Another 
cost variable, especially for academic libraries, is that the vendor may set the price based 
on the size of the potential user population&middot;for example, the charge might be based 
on the number of full-time students. As the number of users increases the price per user 
drops in some incremental manner. Again, as more institutions join, there is a chance 
that a library may decide the cost has become affordable and the final cost is once again 
adjusted. 
</p>
<p> What this means for the acquisitions department is there may be some extended 
period during which it does not know how much money should be set aside (encum-
bered) to pay the expected invoice. Occasionally, by the time the invoice arrives the 
final cost is different than anticipated&middot;higher or lower. In either case, the change can 
present problems for the department, depending upon where the library is in its fiscal 
year (FY). If the change takes place in the first quarter of a FY, it is easier to make 
adjustments in the funding allocations. When such a change takes place in the final 
quarter, however, there may be serious problems. One might wonder why a lower price 
offered at any time of the year would present a problem for the department. When such 
an event takes place in the final quarter, the library might lose money that it may have 
been able to use on a different resource. (See chapter 12, on fiscal management, for a 
full discussion of encumbrance and fiscal-year cycles.) </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Differences between E-Resource and Print Collection Building 151
</p>
<p> Also, like a new car, products may offer optional extras or upgrades; this is es-
pecially true of journal full-text databases. Usually the base product offers access to 
articles from the current issue to some point back in time. For example, base coverage 
may be for the previous ten years; however, the journals in the database may have 
existed for much longer than that. The vendor may offer back-issue coverage at an 
additional cost. Some break down the back files into increments of 10 to 15 years, 
each at an added charge. It might seem obvious that a library with an interest in cer-
tain titles might well have the back issues in paper form and there would be no need 
to purchase access to a digital format as well. That is often the case; however, more 
and more users are becoming accustomed to having 24/7 remote access to journals, 
and they pressure the library to have key titles available in digital format as far back 
as possible. 
</p>
<p> Staff and User Issues 
</p>
<p> Ease of use is another consideration regarding e-resources. Would the product re-
quire staff training? How easy will it be for the public to use, or will users require staff 
assistance? In terms of Web sites, there is also an issue of selecting and maintaining 
links and deciding how to handle that ongoing task (there is some evidence that a Web 
address only remains active for 18 to 24 months before the owner makes some change 
to the address as the site is updated). 6  A source for reviews of potential Web sites that 
a library may wish to provide links to is the Internet Reviews Archive (http://www.
bowdoin.edu/~samato/IRA/), which is the archive for the  College &amp; Research Library 
News  section that lists Web sites for various subject areas. 
</p>
<p> Technical Issues 
</p>
<p> A key technical issue is where the content will reside. Will it exist on the library&Ecirc;s 
server or the vendor&Ecirc;s server? Or is it otherwise Web based? Servers have maximum 
limits for access, after which response time begins to decline, and in extreme cases, 
shuts down. Thus, having a sense of how great the load is on the library&Ecirc;s server be-
comes critical to reaching a decision on whether to acquire a product that would re-
side on the vendor&Ecirc;s server. Another technical consideration is the robustness of the 
library&Ecirc;s information communication technology infrastructure. Certainly, both server 
and infrastructure can be improved, but it will increase overall costs. 
</p>
<p> There is also a question of how much technology support is needed and/or avail-
able from library staff. For smaller libraries, staffing issues are always a challenge, 
and committing any significant amount of time to maintaining or supporting a new 
product is problematic. Knowing what would be required beforehand is essential for 
making an informed purchase decision. 
</p>
<p> Similarly, clarifying what, if any, special equipment or software will be needed is 
an important issue. Also, the question of accessing the content must be fully understood. 
Options range from users needing a password for access, having access IP secured, or 
by barcode access (such as the code on a person&Ecirc;s borrower card), or through a proxy 
server. An increasing concern is whether or not the resource allows for remote access, 
or if it can be accessed only from within the library. Each option has different library 
staffing implications. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>152 8&mdash;E-Resource Issues
</p>
<p> Cancellations 
</p>
<p> When a library cancels a paper-based subscription, it still retains the paper copies it 
paid for and may keep those items indefinitely. With e-resources there is a question re-
garding what, if any, rights the library has to long-term access to the content that existed 
during the time it paid for access. (In the days when subscriptions consisted mainly 
of CD-ROM products that were loaded locally, normally the disks had to be returned 
or destroyed by the library upon termination of a subscription.) A related concern that 
may arise in terms of cancellations is whether the library should cancel subscriptions to 
paper journals if the titles are included in the e-package and/or withdraw books when 
they become available online. Especially with journals, the issue can be more complex 
than it might appear. Some publishers link the cost of the e-journal to maintaining a 
paper subscription&middot;they raise the price of the e-only subscription if the library drops 
the paper subscription. 
</p>
<p> ASSESSMENT OF E-RESOURCES 
</p>
<p> Assessment involves several issues&middot;content of the product, ability to select por-
tions of the product, and statistical data regarding usage. When considering a journal 
database, knowing what titles are included is a factor in the selection decision. A sales 
pitch that the database provides full text for 3,000 journals is not at all helpful. What 
needs to be known are what titles, what time period they cover, whether full text mean 
all graphics are included, whether the graphics are part of the article&Ecirc;s file or must be 
viewed or downloaded separately, and to what degree the titles replicate current paper 
subscriptions. These are a few of the key questions that the vendor and the library must 
answer. 
</p>
<p> If an e-product or e-service under consideration could or would replace paper-
based items, some assessment of how great an improvement the e-version would pro-
vide is reasonable. The e-product will almost always cost more than its paper-based 
version, thus some form of cost benefit analysis is in order, especially in times of tight 
budgets. Essentially, there is a need to justify the additional costs. 
</p>
<p> Related to the cost-benefit analysis is the possibility of canceling the paper-based 
titles in order to reduce the overall cost of the e-title in terms of the library&Ecirc;s budget. 
As noted earlier, some libraries in the early days of e-journal databases thought about 
and did cancel the paper subscriptions to keep within their budget only to find there 
were problems. For example, full-text article databases generally only include adver-
tisements if both text and ads are on the same page. For some academic departments, 
the advertisements are important to their research and teaching. A more critical problem 
is that some publishers place an embargo on when an e-version of a journal issue may 
appear. The publisher&Ecirc;s goal is to maintain its paper subscription base and may hold off 
on an e-version for as much as one year. For many people, such a delay is critical to 
their work, which means the library must maintain the paper version in addition to the 
electronic copy or pay interlibrary loan fees for a requested article that falls within the 
embargo period. 
</p>
<p> When it comes to large database products, very often they are available through 
one or more consortium to which the library belongs. The question then becomes, what 
will the package cost? It is not uncommon for the cost of the product or service to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Assessment of E-Resources 153
</p>
<p>vary from consortium to consortium. This is due to that fact the consortium&Ecirc;s price is 
often based on how many of its members take part in the deal. Many e-products base 
their academic pricing on the basis of institutional student full-time equivalents (FTEs). 
The rate is xx cents per student FTE, and as the total number of FTEs increases at in-
stitutions in the consortium that lease the product the rate drops. Thus, determining the 
library&Ecirc;s final cost can take some time. 
</p>
<p> Statistics 
</p>
<p> While circulation and processing statistics have long been kept for print library 
materials, e-materials can present unique challenges when it comes to quantifying their 
use. Such challenges were succinctly described by Martha Whittaker, who observed 
</p>
<p> On the face of it, keeping track of usage in the digital environment should be 
much easier than in the print environment. . . . Computers are good at count-
ing things. It is not easy, however, because there are so many variables in the 
way people access and use digital materials. We cannot just look at circula-
tion statistics or scan the unshelved books and journals on tables at the end of 
the day for accurate usage information. 7  
</p>
<p> Inherent challenges or not, given that some libraries expend up to 51 percent of 
their materials budget on electronic resources, 8  this means that once an e-resource is 
purchased, it generally needs to be scrutinized much more closely than its print coun-
terpart. As noted by Bertot, McClure, and Ryan, &bdquo;Without the development, collec-
tion, analysis, and reporting of electronic resource and service measures . . . libraries 
are misrepresenting their overall service usage and potentially damaging their ability 
to compete for scarce funding resources in their communities.&permil; 9  
</p>
<p> Luckily, initiatives have been developed in recent years in response to the need for 
gathering statistics for online resources. These include Project COUNTER (Counting 
Online Usage of NeTworked Electronic Resources, http://www.projectcounter.org/), 
and the International Coalition of Library Consortia&Ecirc;s (ICOLC) &bdquo;Guidelines for Sta-
tistical Measures of Usage of Web-Based Information Resources&permil; (http://www.library.
yale.edu/consortia/2001webstats.htm). 10  Project COUNTER was launched in 2002 as 
a means of setting standards for &bdquo;recording and reporting of online usage statistics in 
a consistent, credible and compatible way,&permil; and operates through the publication of a 
series of Codes of Practice, which are designed to specify guidelines for the production 
of vendor reports. The ICOLC Guidelines, on the other hand, established consistent 
&bdquo;boundaries&permil; for what should be included in vendor statistical reports, without com-
promising user privacy or confidentiality. 
</p>
<p> COUNTER and ICOLC address statistics from the vendor side of the equation. 
Additionally, the implementation of a local Electronic Resource Management System 
(ERMS) allows libraries to track acquisitions, usage data, and licensing efforts. ERMSs 
are largely credited to the work of Tim Jewell at the University of Washington and the 
Digital Library Federation. 11  Vendors currently offering such systems include Innova-
tive Interfaces (ERMS) and Ex Libris (Verde). Unfortunately, such systems can be cost 
prohibitive for some institutions. However, low-cost alternatives are available, ranging </p>

<p>from open-source products, 12  to Web 2.0 applications 13  or the use of simple spreadsheet 
software. 14  
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> As Kyrillidou and Bland noted, &bdquo;Not only have electronic materials expenditures 
grown sharply in the past decade, they have grown at a rate far exceeding that of li-
brary materials expenditures overall. . . . In every year of the last decade electronic 
materials expenditures have grown sharply, anywhere between two and ten times faster 
than other materials expenditures have.&permil; 15  Whether or not this rate of growth can be 
sustained in times of economic downturn remains to be seen. However, this statistic 
still highlights the need for technical services staff to understand several of the unique 
issues surrounding the acquisition and maintenance of e-resources, including licens-
ing issues, purchase prices, and consortial efforts to secure such resources for library 
collections. 
</p>
<p> A number of initiatives have been developed to help libraries analyze usage of 
e-resources. These include Project COUNTER, the ICOLC Guidelines, and the ARL 
New Measures Initiative (http://www.arl.org/stats/newmeas/newmeas.html), which 
includes an e-metrics component. Such initiatives have greatly facilitated the way 
e-resources can be analyzed. However, there is a continued need for refinement of such 
measures, as indicated by Blecic, Fiscella, and Wiberley, who reported that continuing 
&bdquo;innovations in electronic resource functionality will necessitate advances in electronic 
resource usage measures to describe use meaningfully.&permil; 16

<p> REVIEW QUESTIONS 
</p>
<p>  1. What are the primary components of a library&Ecirc;s e-collection? 
</p>
<p>  2. Identify the major differences between selecting and acquiring print materi-
als and e-materials. 
</p>
<p>  3. What are the typical goals for the library and for the vendor in terms of 
e-products?

   Serials&mdash;Print 
and Electronic 
</p>
<p> Love e-journals or hate them, one thing a library cannot do is ignore them. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Margaret Sylvia, 2005 
</p>
<p> Within the next ten years or so, we predict that many more major maga-
zine and newspaper publications will be going all-digital. In that environment, 
should we continue to provide a format-based area of the library (the peri-
odicals room)? 
</p>
<p> &middot;Michael Porter and David Lee King, 2009 
</p>
<p> There is some validity to having older magazines as they are primary source 
material, serving as a window to the past. 
</p>
<p>  &middot;School Librarians Workshop,  2009 
</p>
<p> For some people serials are the most frequently consulted library resource. In the 
not-too-distant past, it was print-based serials, and today it is a combination of print and 
digital that many people expect and want. People still subscribe to paper-based news-
papers and magazines. Professional associations still issue information in paper but 
also release it in an e-format. How long this dual process will last is an open question. 
However, it seems likely it will exist for the lifetime of this edition of  Introduction to 
Library Technical Services.  Thus, we will discuss both formats although there will be a 
greater emphasis on the digital side. 
</p>
<p> A shift to electronic serials, or e-serials, is an ongoing process in most libraries, as 
they secure the necessary funding or are able to leverage the price advantages of con-
sortia pricing of publishers&Ecirc; or aggregator&Ecirc;s packages. Some academic libraries have 
established a policy that electronic versions of serials are the first choice rather than 
paper. However, there are some reasons beyond cost that would lead many libraries to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>160 9&mdash;Serials&mdash;Print and Electronic 
</p>
<p>continue to retain paper titles, perhaps in addition to an e-version. Any library that of-
fers recreational reading materials is likely to keep subscriptions to paper versions of 
the most popular serials&middot;magazines and newspapers. There are still people who enjoy 
sitting and reading the entire issue of a magazine or newspaper. Although it is possible 
to do this with electronic publications, the process is cumbersome, time consuming, and 
not all that pleasant. From a library point of view, having a user monopolize a computer 
for an hour or more while reading all of the articles in a journal is rarely practical, as few 
libraries have sufficient machines to allow more than a limited time per user. 
</p>
<p> There are also individuals who enjoy looking at the advertisements, which are gen-
erally omitted in the e-version. Another factor is many people do not have home access 
to high-speed broadband network connections. Downloading even a relatively small 
PDF containing modest graphics with a dial-up connection takes a very long time. An-
other factor is the escalating cost of subscriptions, even for individuals, which translates 
into people depending on libraries for access to some of their lower-interest journals 
and magazines. 
</p>
<p> Currency is very important for those who use serials on a regular basis. Serial 
update intervals can be very short, daily in the case of many newspapers. Articles in a 
serial are short (compared to book-length treatments of the same topic) and focus on 
a fairly narrow subject. Readers with very specific information needs frequently find 
that serials provide the desired data more quickly than books. Finally, serials are often 
the first printed source of information about a new subject or development. People use 
serials as a source for learning about new things while using books to gain a broader 
or deeper knowledge of a subject they may have first encountered in a serial. Also, the 
sheer volume of new information appearing in serials far exceeds that of books. 
</p>
<p> Technology has modified almost every aspect of library operations; its impact on 
many activities, if not most, has been in how we do something rather than what we do. 
With serials, at least for the electronic versions (or e-serials), the &bdquo;what is done&permil; is very 
different now (a few examples being the elimination of: check-in, labeling issues, insert-
ing security strips, shelving and reshelving, searching for missing issues, gathering up 
issues to go to the bindery, or shifting of bound copies to make room for new volumes). 
Obviously, while these advances are major changes in the way serials work is done&middot;all 
those steps do still apply to paper-based serials in the vast majority of libraries. 
</p>
<p> WHAT IS A SERIAL? 
</p>
<p> Customers and librarians frequently use the words  journals, magazines, periodi-
cals,  and  serials  interchangeably, with no great misunderstanding resulting from the im-
precise usage. Thomas Nisonger, in his book on serials management, devoted more than 
six pages to how different groups have attempted to define the material that is covered 
in this chapter. 1  As noted earlier, the electronic world is changing the nature of serials 
and the way libraries process them. The Internet has even changed what a library should 
consider a serial. T. Scott Plutchak suggested that &bdquo;The serial as defined by the librar-
ians is an anachronism in the digital age, and will not survive for long. . . . This matter 
of definitions bedevils us all, and I&Ecirc;m sure you&Ecirc;ve had the same kinds of discussions in 
your institutions that we&Ecirc;ve had in mine as we try to figure out how to shoehorn these 
new information resources that we&Ecirc;re dealing with into the same old categories.&permil; 2  For </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>What Is a Serial? 161
</p>
<p>our purposes, the following definition will suffice: a serial is a publication issued as 
one of a consecutively numbered and indefinitely continued series. 
</p>
<p> Plutchak&Ecirc;s point is well taken, that is, the library focus has been, and still is to a 
large extent, on the physical format rather than content. However, at present the old 
definitions still exist and are widely used in libraries. What are those definitions? Some 
years ago, Fritz Machlup and Kenneth Leeson developed an 18-part classification sys-
tem for serials. 3    Their system covered all types of serials, including serials &bdquo;not else-
where classified.&permil; (We have yet to encounter a serial that does not fit into one of the 
other 17 categories.) Each of the major categories has some special features that have 
implications for the acquisitions staff. 
</p>
<p>  Institutional reports  are annual, semiannual, quarterly, or occasional reports of cor-
porations, financial institutions, and organizations serving business and finance. Aca-
demic libraries serving business and management programs frequently need to acquire 
this type of serial. Corporate libraries actively collect this category. Most of the reports 
available to libraries and information centers are free for the asking. 
</p>
<p> Some organizations will add a library to their distribution list, but others will re-
spond only to requests for the current edition. Collecting in this area is labor intensive, 
because it requires maintaining address and correspondence files, especially if a li-
brary collects much beyond the large national corporations. Thanks to online resources, 
such as EDGAR Online (from the Securities and Exchange Commission), filings are 
now available from a number of sources. 
</p>
<p>  Yearbooks and proceedings  are annuals, biennials, and occasional publications, 
bound or stapled, including yearbooks, almanacs, proceedings, transactions, memoirs, di-
rectories, and reports of societies and associations. Many libraries collect these serials, 
especially academic, special, and large public libraries. The more libraries that collect a 
particular society&Ecirc;s or association&Ecirc;s publications, the more likely it is that a commercial 
vendor will handle a standing order for the material. Although it is possible to secure 
some of these serials through a vendor, a significant number must be obtained directly 
from the society or association. Again, this category normally requires setting up and 
maintaining address and correspondence files, which is only slightly less labor intensive 
than doing the same for annual reports of organizations. 
</p>
<p>  Superseding serials  fall into one of two categories, both of which are labor intensive 
in their paper-based format. One group consists of the superseding serial services (each 
new issue superseding previous ones). These include publications such as telephone 
directories and product catalogs. The second group consists of the non-superseding 
serial services, many of which were print-based loose-leaf publications that provided 
information such as changes in accounting rules or government regulations. In the past, 
both groups often required careful filing of new material and the removal of other (older 
or superseded) material. Most of the services are now available online, reducing most 
of the staffing and training issues. Most of these publications are only available from 
the publisher. Examples of such services are the  Labor Relations Reporter  from the Bu-
reau of National Affairs, the  Standard Federal Tax Reporter  from Commerce Clearing 
House, and  Ontario Annotated Reports  from LexisNexis Canada. 
</p>
<p> Non-superseding serials are less of a problem, and some are available from serial 
jobbers. However, the materials in this class tend to be expensive, and many must be 
ordered directly from the publisher. Indexing and abstracting services fall into one of 
these two classes. All types of libraries need a few of these reference serials. As the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>162 9&mdash;Serials&mdash;Print and Electronic 
</p>
<p>serial collection grows, there is an increasing demand from users for more indexing and 
abstracting services. 
</p>
<p>  Newspapers  are one of the obvious serials that libraries acquire in both print and 
electronic formats. Serial jobbers handle subscriptions to major domestic and interna-
tional newspapers for libraries. At the time the order is placed for a paper subscription 
for nonlocal newspapers, the library must establish the value of the newspaper&Ecirc;s content 
for its user community. That is, how critical is it to have the latest issue in the shortest 
possible time? For example,  The London Times  can be ordered in a variety of delivery 
packages, each with a different cost: daily airmail edition by air freight, daily airmail 
edition by airmail (the most expensive option), daily regular edition by air freight, daily 
regular edition in weekly packets (the least expensive option), or microfilm edition.  The 
New York Times  offers an even wider variety of editions: city edition, late city edition, 
national edition, New York edition, large-type weekly, same day, next day, two day, 
weekly packets, microfilm, and others. Clearly, each variation has cost and workload 
implications. 
</p>
<p> Almost all major newspapers are now somewhat available online; we say some-
what because at the time this was written, newspapers were struggling with the issue of 
staying in business. They are trying to develop a workable model for generating income 
to replace revenue lost due to rapidly declining paper subscriptions. As a result they 
often allow free access to a limited version of a story and provide access to the full story 
when a reader pays a fee&middot;per-story fee, monthly fee, and annual fee are some of the 
models in use in 2010. Libraries can also provide online access through several data-
base vendors such as NewsBank; some of the serials databases include some newspaper 
coverage as well, for example EBSCO host.  
</p>
<p>  Newsletters,  leaflets, news releases, and similar materials are a form of serial that 
some libraries actively acquire. Corporate libraries are the most active in gathering 
material in this category, especially those supporting marketing, lobbying, and public 
relations activities. Many of the items in this class are free; all a library needs to do is 
ask to be placed on the distribution list. Other items, especially newsletters containing 
economic or trade data, can be exceedingly expensive. (A number of U.S. services cost 
in excess of $20,000 for quarterly newsletters of only a few pages. It is at that point that 
one can begin to fully appreciate the difference between the cost of the information and 
the cost of the package in which it comes.) Whether a service is free or subscription 
based, someone must put in the time and effort to identify the sources and get on the 
appropriate mailing lists or enter the subscription. 
</p>
<p>  Magazines  are the most common serials and the category that most often comes 
to mind when thinking about serials. Machlup and Leeson defined magazines as mass-
market or popular serials and divided them into five subgroups. These are the titles that 
almost any serial jobber will handle for a library. Following are the five subgroups: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Mass market serials and weekly or monthly news magazines (such as  News-
week  or  Macleans ) 
</p>
<p> &bull; Popular magazines dealing with fiction, pictures, sports, travel, fashion, sex, 
humor, and comics (such as  Sports Illustrated  or  Toronto Fashion ) 
</p>
<p> &bull; Magazines that popularize science and social, political, and cultural affairs 
( Smithsonian  or  Canadian Geographic ) </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>What Is a Serial? 163
</p>
<p> &bull; Magazines focusing on opinion and criticism&middot;social, political, literary, artis-
tic, aesthetic, or religious (examples are  Foreign Affairs  or  This Magazine ) 
</p>
<p> &bull; Other magazines not elsewhere classified. An example of such a title is an 
organization publication (governmental or private) that is really a public re-
lations vehicle, sometimes called a &bdquo;house organ.&permil; These publications often 
contain general-interest material, but there is usually some clearly stated or 
implied relationship between the subject covered and the issuing organization 
(e.g.,  Plain Truth  or  On Patrol   ). Another type of publication in the &bdquo;other&permil; 
category is the magazine found in the pocket of airline seats. 
</p>
<p> Libraries may receive a substantial number of house organs because their publishers 
give them away. Vendors seldom handle this type of magazine. 
</p>
<p>  Journals  are, in the Machlup system, titles that are of interest to a narrower segment 
of the user population, sometimes referred to as &bdquo;informed laypeople,&permil; and researchers 
and scholars. This category has four subcategories, with one subcategory divided into 
two smaller units: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Nonspecialized journals for the intelligentsia who are well-informed on 
literature, art, social affairs, politics, and so on ( Science  and  Equinox  are 
examples) 
</p>
<p> &bull; Learned journals for specialists&middot;primary research journals and secondary 
research journals ( American Indian Culture and Research Journal  and  The 
Canadian Historical Review,  for example) 
</p>
<p> &bull; Practical professional journals in applied fields, including technology, medi-
cine, law, agriculture, management, library and information science, business, 
and trades ( RQ  or  Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine , for example) 
</p>
<p> &bull; Parochial journals of any type but addressed chiefly to a parochial audience&middot;
local or regional&middot;( Kiva  or  Toronto Life ). 
</p>
<p> Most titles in these categories are available through vendors, although the library must 
place direct orders for some of the more specialized learned journals. Most parochial 
journals must be purchased directly from the publisher; local history and regional ar-
chaeological publications are examples of this class of serial. Sometimes a library must 
join an association to obtain its publications. 
</p>
<p> The final serial category identified by Machlup consists of &bdquo;government publica-
tions, reports, bulletins, statistical series, releases, etc. by public agencies, executive, 
legislative and judiciary, local, state, national, foreign and international.&permil; Because this 
group is covered in chapter 10, no discussion is included here. 
</p>
<p> With these variations in serials in mind, it is clear why there is confusion about 
terms and why there are challenges in collecting and preserving them. Each type fills 
a niche in the information dissemination system. Although they do create special han-
dling procedures and problems, they are a necessary part of any library&Ecirc;s collection. 
Patrick Carr opened his article with the following: 
</p>
<p> The literature of serials librarianship published in 2006 and 2007 reveals 
a field in rapid transition. The changes occurring range from the shifting </p>

</p>
<p>nature of serial collections to evolving models, initiatives, and management 
strategies used to acquire and administer access to these collections. 4  
</p>
<p> The remainder of this chapter looks at some of the long-standing issues related to serial 
management and many of the transition issues alluded to in the Carr quotation. 
</p>
<p> ISSUES AND CONCERNS 
</p>
<p> Aline Soules explored the issues of the changing nature of the concept of serials 
in the digital world and the challenges facing both the producers and consumers of the 
information such publications make available. She concluded her article by stating; 
&bdquo;The older, established concept of a serial served as the basis for the new, more flex-
ible concepts of continuing and integrating resources.&permil; 5  The key word in the foregoing 
is &bdquo;continuing.&permil; The following issues and concerns relate to serials, whether print or 
electronic, in their current forms. How they may change over the next 5 to 10 years 
is impossible to predict accurately. What is certain is that the issues and concerns will 
continue to evolve and change. 
</p>
<p> A serial, by definition, usually implies that the library will have an ongoing com-
mitment to acquire the title. That commitment raises issues of staffing and budget con-
cerns. From a technical services workload point of view, print subscriptions require 
annual renewal and attention. E-serials, at least those in a vendor&Ecirc;s package of serials, 
require somewhat less staff attention; however, such packages ought to be reviewed an-
nually. Most serial vendors have a system that allows for automatic renewal, thus reduc-
ing some of the staffing concerns. Such automatic renewal options should not stop the 
staff from annually reviewing the renewal list to ensure that all the titles and databases 
are still of interest to the user community. 
</p>
<p> Cost and Pricing 
</p>
<p> A long-term commitment to a serial results in subscription costs becoming a fixed 
feature of the budget. With rapidly rising prices and small budget increases, each year 
serials take up an increasing proportion of the total materials budget. Chapter 12 (on 
fiscal management) provides more information about this problem, but in general, serial 
prices have been increasing at a much faster rate than general inflation. Thus, each year 
the amount of money required to maintain the present serials subscriptions increases at 
a rate greater than many libraries are able to sustain. 
</p>
<p> One important difference between print and electronic serials, from the library per-
spective, is that e-serials pricing is very opaque compared with print. Print prices are 
basically fixed, though there may be a discount for placing a multiple-year subscrip-
tion. Perhaps there is a discount if the library subscribes to several titles from the same 
publisher. A serials jobber may give a discount to a library when the total value of the 
subscriptions reaches a certain level. In such cases, it is based on the total list of titles 
not any one title. 
</p>
<p> When it comes to pricing e-versions of titles, the picture is rather murky. Some of 
the factors that complicate the situation are </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Issues and Concerns 165
</p>
<p> &bull; pricing based on being a component of a bundle or deal, 
 &bull; pricing that links paper and digital versions of a title, 
 &bull; pricing based on the concept of &bdquo;site&permil; (frequently, branches of a library 
</p>
<p>each count as an independent unit rather than as part of a single system), 
 &bull; pricing based on the number of simultaneous users (maximum number of 
</p>
<p>readers allowed at one time), 
 &bull; pricing based on a license for a single library versus one obtained through 
</p>
<p>a consortium, and 
 &bull; pricing based on receiving the current title only or including both the cur-
</p>
<p>rent issues and backfiles. 
</p>
<p> Essentially, one is never completely certain what the cost will be until the invoice 
arrives. 
</p>
<p> Publishers have employed a dual pricing model for some time for print titles&middot;one 
price for individual subscribers and another for institutions and libraries. The rationale 
behind the model was that the institutional subscription provided access for many read-
ers, some of whom might be individual subscribers if it were not for the institutional 
subscription. For electronic serials, some publishers and vendors employ a somewhat 
similar tiered model. This model is based on some range of factors, such as the size of 
the library&Ecirc;s acquisition budget or the number of potential readers/users. Most of the 
tiered schedules have multiple tiers, such as using the acquisitions budget example 
(under $100,000, $100,001 to $250,000, and so forth) as price points or tiers. Tiered 
pricing is rather common for consortia purchases, and the final cost for a library be-
comes a function of how many libraries decide to participate in the deal. (We discussed 
this issue in chapter 8.) 
</p>
<p> Some publishers allow free online access when a library or individual places an 
order for a print subscription. An example is  The Economist,  which allows for online 
access to back issues, additional material for a story in the print issue, and access to ad-
ditional news stories. One reason for providing the access for libraries is that it appears 
to maintain a subscriber base, which is a factor in how the publication is able to charge 
advertisers&middot;more subscribers equals a higher advertising fee. The extra material avail-
able online becomes a bonus for the library users. 
</p>
<p> Some years ago Kristin Gerhard suggested that there are nine pricing models for 
e-serials: 6  
</p>
<p>  1. General price-for-value 
  2. Clarity or firmness 
  3. Number of simultaneous users 
  4. Type of users 
  5. Location of seats 
  6. Amount of use 
  7. Unit priced 
  8. Timing of payments 
  9. Division of pricing 
</p>
<p> By price-for-value, she was suggesting a relationship from the library perspective be-
tween readers to cost&middot;many readers for a high-price publication could be viewed as 
inexpensive, while a low-priced title with only one or two readers would be considered </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>166 9&mdash;Serials&mdash;Print and Electronic 
</p>
<p>expensive. The model also includes extra features that become part of the subscription, 
such as online access to additional material. Her clarity or firmness model related to 
how much flexibility there was in the price&middot;if a discount was available or not and if 
negotiation was possible, for example. (We touched on simultaneous users in the pre-
ceding paragraphs.) Type of users related to such factors as total institutional full-time 
equivalents, student majors in a discipline, or business type in nonacademic environ-
ments. Location of seats is a variation of the site pricing covered earlier. Amount-of-
use models include pay per page viewed, pay for amount of time, or unlimited usage. 
Unit pricing relates to a charge per article, per issue, or per journal&middot;current and/or 
backfile. Timing of payments is more like financing payments&middot;one time, quarterly, 
or other some other option&middot;of course with some interest costs associated, and/or pos-
sible maintenance fees. The final model is a consortia model in which the total package 
price is divided equally among members. 
</p>
<p> The bottom line is that the proliferation of e-serials has not reduced the cost of 
acquiring and maintaining a serials collection&middot;an early hope of librarians. Publishers 
have realized little in terms of cost savings from moving from print to digital formats; 
nor has the greater than Consumer Price Index (CPI) price increase spiral slowed much. 
The e-format has not changed the amount of library staff time that must be devoted to 
managing serials&middot;the work is rather different, but the time commitment is just as great. 
What e-serials have done is provide more readers with more information more quickly 
than was ever possible in the print-only environment. 
</p>
<p> Acquisition 
</p>
<p> Electronic serials have created new challenges for acquisitions departments. Per-
haps one of the biggest challenges is calculating price increases. As we will discuss in 
chapter 12, having sound estimates of the coming year&Ecirc;s price increases is very impor-
tant for the acquisitions department and the library. Print journals have a long history of 
double-digit annual price increases. As a result, the profession and serial vendors devel-
oped several annual reports that provide some rather accurate estimates of the potential 
jumps in price. The reports break prices down into various subject/topical/library-type 
categories, making it possible to make predications. That system has not worked very 
effectively for e-titles, however, at least for the producer and vendor packages, because 
of the number of variables in how a library acquires access to such packages. 
</p>
<p> The so-called &bdquo;Big Deal&permil; packages of e-journals have created the most difficulty 
for predicting cost increases year to year for even a class of libraries. Carlson and Pope 
noted that the Big Deals offered a library a large number of titles for a flat annual license 
fee. 7  Publishers and other vendors (sometimes referred to as aggregators) put forward 
packages. In the case of publishers, the package usually included all of their titles; ag-
gregators offered packages of titles from a variety of publishers. Some libraries negoti-
ated a license independently, while many more acquired access through a consortium. 
To complicate estimating e-price increases, various consortia worked out a price based 
on its membership, which could change from year to year. The result has been rather 
great price variations. 
</p>
<p> Another outcome of the Big Deal is that many of the packages are just that, a pack-
age. A library either gets all the titles or does not get the package. That means a library 
may, or likely will, have to handle a number of titles that are irrelevant for its service </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>Issues and Concerns 167
</p>
<p>population. As noted earlier, there are many issues associated with handling e-titles, and 
having extra work related to titles almost no local user is interested in just adds to the 
staff workload with no tangible benefit for the library. David Ball noted that with Big 
Deals in place, &bdquo;we no longer take the decisions on developing our collections that we 
have been used to. . . . We shall increasingly decide on content not at the journal level 
but at the publisher level.&permil; 8  Users are interested in content not the journal title or who 
publishes the information. Packages of serials shift the focus away from a fundamental 
tenet of collections development&middot;meeting user needs. Big-deal costs can be so high 
as to reduce available funds to the point that a library must start canceling individual 
subscriptions or dramatically cut back on book and media purchases. A counterpoint 
view regarding the value of big packages was expressed by Donald Taylor, who noted 
that newly available titles could be used by researchers: &bdquo;Although this analysis is only 
a snapshot of activity, the increase in citations in 2004 and 2005 to articles from Big 
Deal journals previously unavailable to SFU [Simon Fraser University] Library dem-
onstrates that SFU researchers are making use of these previously unavailable journals 
in their research.&permil; 9  
</p>
<p> By early 2010, the economic picture for libraries had radically changed from what 
it was when Big Deals first were being offered. As a result, stagnant or declining finan-
cial resources have forced a rethinking of the overall value of such packages. Certainly, 
some libraries have sharply reduced their use of package deals. Some have been work-
ing with vendors and publishers to modify packages&middot;tailoring the package to reflect 
just titles the library needs and thereby reduce the cost of the package. In late 2009, 
David Fowler suggested that, 
</p>
<p> The next twelve months to two years will be critical to the future of librar-
ies as they look to new ways to acquire and present materials in a time of 
declining budgets, but with an ever-demanding user base. Full or partial di-
vestment of Big Deal packages is an inevitable element of this transition. 
The full impact of how libraries will cope is yet to be known, but it seems 
inevitable that the publishing landscape will look much different in 2011 
and beyond than it does in 2009. 10  
</p>
<p> As is true of most aspects of e-serials, managing them is complex. One small ex-
ample are open-access titles (discussed more fully later in this chapter), which may or 
may not pass through the acquisitions department because they are free. Such titles 
raise the issue of who will be responsible for ensuring that such titles are available in 
the same manner as paid-for titles. Another question is, who in the library is responsible 
for the various licenses? When it comes to a new package license, the matter may be 
straightforward; however, just as serial prices increase every year, many licensors make 
small adjustments to their agreements from time to time. Tracking such modifications 
and assessing their implications can present a challenge. 
</p>
<p> Because of the complexity of managing electronic resources, most ILS vendors 
and other vendors offer serials management software. Most of the available packages 
have three special features: 
</p>
<p> &bull; The system links or shows the relationship of each e-title, package, license, 
and how the library makes the material accessible to users. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>168 9&mdash;Serials&mdash;Print and Electronic 
</p>
<p> &bull; The system is able to track each of the above for each title. 
 &bull; The system provides the capability to generate a variety of reports and can 
</p>
<p>export data about each, all, or a subset of titles. 
</p>
<p> The following list of items these system do, or ought to, track suggests just how com-
plicated the process is. Some factors apply to managing either print or electronic titles 
and some apply to e-serials only. 
</p>
<p> Factors that apply to print and electronic titles: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Title 
 &bull;  Purchase order number 
 &bull;  Fund charged 
 &bull;  Date ordered 
 &bull;  Vendor/publisher 
 &bull;  Annual subscription cost 
 &bull;  Renewal date 
 &bull;  Coverage dates 
</p>
<p> Factors that apply only to e-serials: 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Information if both print and e-versions 
 &bull;  Consortia source, if applicable 
 &bull;  Usage statistics (from online sources) 
 &bull;  URL of title in library 
 &bull;  Limitations on access, if any 
 &bull;  License restrictions 
 &bull;  Date license was reviewed 
 &bull;  Person signing license 
 &bull;  Cataloging notification 
 &bull;  Webmaster notification 
 &bull;  Administrative user name and password 
 &bull;  Technical support information 
</p>
<p> Processing 
</p>
<p> Another fixed element of serials is processing. Both print titles and e-serials require 
regular maintenance and updating. When ordering and receiving a monograph, the li-
brary incurs a one-time cost. but serials have ongoing costs regardless of format. 
</p>
<p> Checking in and claiming missing issues is a normal part of maintaining print seri-
als collections. A staff member records each issue when it arrives in the library. When 
a person notes a missing items, the library contacts the publisher or subscription agent 
to request the missing material&middot;this is known as  placing a claim.  Acting promptly is 
important because publishers generally print only slightly more copies than the number 
of subscribers. Serial publishers know a certain percentage of issues do go astray in the 
mail, and they print extra copies to cover expected claims. There are times when the 
number of claims is greater than the number of available copies. When that happens, 
some unlucky libraries receive out-of-print notices. The closer the claim is made to the 
publication date, the greater the chances are of receiving the wayward issue. ILS serial </p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Issues and Concerns 169
</p>
<p>modules assist in all aspects of serials work, including providing automatic claiming. 
Clearly, each new serial adds to the workload on an ongoing basis. 
</p>
<p> Work routines for electronic publications, as mentioned earlier, are different. The 
Digital Library Federation has developed a set of flow diagrams that reflect a type 
of best practices for acquiring electronic journals (http://www.diglib.org/pubs/dlf102/
dlf102.htm#dlfermi0408appb). (We urge readers to review this document to fully grasp 
the complexity of the process. Many of the items on the chart are activities that must 
also be handled for print titles.) 
</p>
<p> Processing e-journals and e-serials, from selection to access, is a complex process 
as the aforementioned flow charts illustrate. We touched on the issue of knowing the 
final cost of e-materials earlier. Another question is, how many times does a library 
need to provide access to the same material? And, how much money might be saved if 
the title were available in only one database? We cannot say much about the cost factor 
of title duplication; however, there is clear evidence regarding the actual duplication 
concern. 
</p>
<p> The following is a small example of title duplication in aggregator databases using 
two librarianship titles.  Library Resources &amp; Technical Services  is available full text 
electronically from the American Library Association, Wilson&Ecirc;s  Omnifile  and  Library 
Literature and Information Science Full Text, ProQuest Central  and  ProQuest Re-
search Library,  and EBSCOhost&Ecirc;s  Academic Search Complete. Library Journal  has 
even greater duplication&middot;in addition to its availability in the EBSCO, ProQuest, and 
Wilson databases, it is also found in ABI/ Inform, LexisNexis Academic,  and  Master-
FILE Premier.  
</p>
<p> Most libraries have limited acquisition funds, so licensing access to the same title 
multiple times does cost more than necessary at times&middot;each aggregator pays the pub-
lisher a fee for each title in the database. Although the amount of money may be small, 
there is additional work for the library. The challenge is that not all the databases are 
equal in their coverage and the end-users need to know what is covered where and 
when in order to decide which product to start searching. (Using  Library Journal  as an 
example, EBSCO covers 1976 to date, ABI and ProQuest databases have 1989 on-
ward, Wilson coverage starts in 1998, and LexisNexis coverage starts with 2001.) Most 
aggregate databases contain thousands of titles. Someone on the library staff must 
identify the all titles and the coverage in all the databases and ensure the accuracy of 
the information on an ongoing basis. We explore additional issues of access in the next 
section of this chapter. 
</p>
<p> Another factor that creates work challenges and cost concerns for the library is that 
occasionally a publisher will decide to enhance the digital revenue stream for a title by 
auctioning off the digital rights to a single aggregator. When that happens, assuming the 
title in question is very important to the library&Ecirc;s user community, it may mean licens-
ing a database that contains that title and hundreds or even thousands of titles of little 
or no interest. 
</p>
<p> Access 
</p>
<p> Gaining access to serial content is also a concern. In a print environment, users have 
little interest in searching through issue after issue to locate needed material, especially 
in light of the ease of employing the Boolean search capabilities of online databases. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>170 9&mdash;Serials&mdash;Print and Electronic 
</p>
<p>An entire industry has developed around providing access to print serials. A variety of 
indexing and abstracting services provide services that help people locate information 
in serials. Naturally, most of these services are expensive and represent a further con-
cern when maintaining a useful serials collection. There are also access issues related 
to digital serials, although of a very different type. Earlier, we mentioned the issue of 
what happens to access to articles in e-titles when the library cancels its subscription. At 
least with print issues, the library retains the issues it paid for; continuing access to such 
e-issues may or may not be possible depending on the license terms the library agreed 
to when it started the subscription. 
</p>
<p> One important reason users want access to serials is their currency. Digital versions 
of print-based titles may or may not be as current as the print version. There are two 
aspects to this issue&middot;who creates the digital version and when that version is released. 
Converting the print material to a digital format takes some time, perhaps just a matter 
of a few hours between when the print and digital forms are available to users; however, 
when the publishers outsource the digitization work, the delay can be weeks or even 
months. The second factor is an embargo placed on the release of the electronic ver-
sion. That is, the publisher, in an effort to retain the paper subscription base, withholds 
the release of digital version for a period of time. The length of that time frame varies; 
a frequent embargo period is until the next print issue is released. Other publishers 
may employ a fixed period, such as two or more months regardless of when the next 
issue appears. (Yearlong embargoes of full-text content in aggregator databases are not 
uncommon.) 
</p>
<p> A rarely discussed access issue, at least in the professional literature, is the com-
pleteness and reliability of the digital version compared with the print version. A print 
version is not subject to modification of its content. Digital versions can be and are eas-
ily modified, and not just for correcting an author error of fact. Yes, publishers do issue 
corrections and errata sheets from time to time; however, those do not modify the text 
that first appeared. 
</p>
<p> There are occasions when e-content was there yesterday and then&middot;poof&middot;it&Ecirc;s gone 
today. Such disappearances arise most often from a court decision or legal settlement. 
One major example, which is still not fully resolved, started in 2001 ( New York Times v. 
Tasini ). The original Supreme Court decision revolved around the question of when is 
&bdquo;revised collective work&permil; actually a revision or a new work and, in the case of freelance 
writers, who owns copyright. What the court ruled was, when a user of a digital version 
of the material sees an independent article and perceives it to be independent (i.e., it is 
not in the original context of the publication, including advertisements) such material is 
not a revised work and the author retains all rights. The result was that database vendors 
and publishers either had to locate the author and negotiate a new contract or remove the 
digital material. As result, thousands of articles disappeared from databases. 
</p>
<p> The court also suggested that the parties attempt to reach a settlement to resolve 
matters. In 2009, the court rejected a proposed settlement that would have created a 
method for handling material for which the publisher could not locate the author. Once 
again thousands of digital articles were in jeopardy of disappearing. As Adam Liptak 
wrote, &bdquo;With no comprehensive settlement in place, the brief added, the publishers and 
databases will have no choice but to search for and delete whole swaths of freelance 
works from their digital archives, or risk repetitive litigation over the same dispute the 
parties sought to settle in this case.&permil; 11  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Issues and Concerns 171
</p>
<p> Another type of disappearance, perhaps less common, is the removal of controver-
sial material as the result of a legal settlement or verbal agreement. One such example 
was when  The Economist  reported it withdrew part of an article from its digital archive 
on June 7, 2003, page 67. In this instance, it was part of a defamation agreement. It is 
difficult to assess just how often all or parts of digital articles are modified as a result 
of threats of legal action, ethical reasons, political correctness, and other reasons. Such 
changes are easy to carry out in the digital world. From a scholarly and historical point 
of view, having the original and modified version available for study could shed light 
on changing values and views. 
</p>
<p> Providing access to digital journals is not a simple matter of mounting a database. 
It is far more complex than labeling and placing a paper issue on the shelf in the pu-
blic service area. Libraries have several options for providing end-user access&middot;Web 
pages, through the OPAC, through online course systems such as Blackboard, and 
through in-house reserve systems. No matter which options are selected, the library 
must maintain such things as operable pathways, checking that any links are up to date 
and that the expected material is still active on the site. Beyond this, the library must 
work to make the access as transparent and user-friendly as possible. Activities such as 
the foregoing require staff time and effort; thus, e-serials have not reduced the serials 
workload, merely changed its nature. 
</p>
<p> Most libraries maintain a separate database for their serials. When that is the case 
a number of questions ought to be considered and reviewed from time to time. A sam-
pling of such questions includes the following: 
</p>
<p> &bull; How much information should the library provide to end-users regarding 
each title? 
</p>
<p> &bull; Should the library establish a priority listing for titles that appear in more 
than one database? 
</p>
<p> &bull; Should the library limit the number of hits that come up on a search? This 
may be important in school and smaller public libraries. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Should the library attempt to identify peer-reviewed journals for end-
users? 
</p>
<p> &bull; Should there be information about embargoes associated with hits from 
embargoed titles? 
</p>
<p> Each question has implications for staff workloads, generally those of technical ser-
vices staff. 
</p>
<p> To close this section, we should mention the concept of open access, which is a 
business model that allows end-users to have access to journal content without paying 
a fee. In short, the model hopes that donations and advertising will generate enough in-
come to allow the publication to continue. The notion that somehow material gets on the 
Web with no cost involved is a myth. If nothing more, there are time costs involved with 
getting anything ready to go on the Web. From a scholarly journal point of view, even 
in the print environment, large amounts of time are volunteered by peer reviewers; that 
does not change in the digital world. Generally, journal editors are compensated, per-
haps modestly, but nonetheless they are paid something for the time they devote to put-
ting together an issue. Again, that is unlikely to change in the e-environment, at least in 
the long term. The reality is, as Steve Black noted, &bdquo;Open Access has two faces, if you </p>

<p>will, the philosophical, mission-driven decision to maximize availability to potential 
readers, and business models of how to pay the bills without subscription revenue.&permil; 12  
</p>
<p> Preservation 
</p>
<p> Long-term preservation of information is one of the responsibilities of the nation&Ecirc;s 
large research libraries. To some extent all libraries engage in preservation activities 
for shorter or longer periods of time. In the not very distant past, libraries committed a 
significant portion of their collection storage space to housing serials. While indeed cur-
rency of information is the major attraction of serials for end-users, serials also provide 
a record of past events that researchers and students can and do draw upon. Thus, there 
is a need for libraries to think about how to preserve the information contained in seri-
als, and they have a responsibility to take on this preservation role. 
</p>
<p> Most print serials arrive in successive issues as paperbacks. If the library main-
tains print serials indefinitely or a title receives relatively heavy use, the library usually 
repackages the serial for more convenient handling or preservation. One method is to 
store the loose issues in a cardboard or metal container (sometimes referred to as a 
Princeton File) that keeps a limited number of issues together in a vertical position. This 
makes it easier to shelve the loose issues alongside bound materials. 
</p>
<p> The most common long-term storage treatment of paper-based serials is binding. 
Bindery operations are usually part of technical services and are associated with serials 
activities. Several labor-intensive steps are involved in processing serial binding activi-
ties. Someone must decide how quickly to bind a completed volume of a journal. (A 
journal with a relatively low number of pages per volume and that receives relatively 
low usage might not go to the bindery until several volumes have arrived. At the other 
extreme are weekly publications that receive very heavy use; such journals may go to 
the bindery several times in a year.) Normally, current issues of journals are in open 
stacks where users have easy access. When it is time to bind a title, someone must 
collect the appropriate issues, prepare bindery instructions that indicate the color of 
the binding, the journal title that is to appear on the spine of the binding and, if the li-
brary classifies its serials, the classification, volume number, and year or years included. 
Upon the return of a bindery shipment, someone must review each physical volume to 
ensure that the instructions were carried out properly. This describes the ideal situation, 
which does not always occur; sometimes a needed issue is not on the shelf. Perhaps a 
user has it, perhaps someone left it on a table or in a study carrel, or perhaps it has gone 
missing. Sorting out the problems takes time, and when the issue is missing, the library 
must decide if or how to replace the missing material (some firms specialize in selling 
back issues of journals). 
</p>
<p> A third preservation alternative for print titles is microformat storage. Microfor-
mats save large amounts of collection space and rarely go missing. However, users gen-
erally dislike the format. The format also requires equipment to read the material, and 
more often than not equipment that has scanning or printing capabilities, all of which 
require servicing, staff training, funding, and floor space. In addition to the foregoing, 
there are questions regarding format&middot;microfilm or microfiche, positive or negative im-
ages, standard or archival quality, and what reduction ratios to use. 
</p>
<p> Today&Ecirc;s digital world raises questions about the need to retain long runs of jour-
nals that occupy valuable floor space. (Some libraries have ceased binding titles that </p>

</p>
<p>they have available in a digital format.) An interesting article looking at print journal 
retention in a medical library environment, where access to older research information 
is often important, is by Kaplan, Steinberg, and Doucette. The study examined two 
concerns&middot;the need for information older than 15 years and the chronic library problem 
of lack of collection storage space. The authors concluded: 
</p>
<p> Citation analysis and ILL statistics clearly indicate that the current literature 
is used predominately and that use of older journal literature drops dramati-
cally after the current fifteen years. . . . The authors and the majority of sur-
vey respondents think that the tide is slowly shifting away from maintaining 
large, costly retrospective collections toward the concept of access instead 
of ownership with a fresh approach to the library as place. 13  
</p>
<p> Librarians are well aware of end-users&Ecirc; preference for online or digital access to 
information. However, before making a decision regarding long-term retention of print 
journals, the library ought to engage in some serious review of the issues of the long-
term viability of digital data. While long-term binding of print serials takes time and 
money, the process is not that complex. When it comes to e-serials, the situation is far 
more problematic, and it appears likely to be far more expensive long term. 
</p>
<p> First, and foremost, print retention decisions have almost always been the library&Ecirc;s 
sole responsibility or purview&middot;at least for the vast majority of libraries. (Again, the 
large research libraries and organizations such as the Center for Research Libraries do 
have a concern with maintaining at least one copy of all books and journals somewhere 
in the country.) Digital preservation decisions involve at least two other players&middot;pub-
lishers or authors and digital database vendors. In terms of scholarly communication, 
end-user interests and needs ought to also factor into the decision-making process. 
</p>
<p> Digital preservation covers all information formats, regardless of how they origi-
nated&middot;print and digital, print to digital, or &bdquo;born digital.&permil; There are two basic technical 
issues for digital preservation&middot;how the data are stored (e.g., hard drive, server, CD, 
DVD) and the retrieval-equipment capabilities (e.g., hardware, operating systems, and 
application software). Both are complex and subject to rather rapid change. &bdquo;Here today 
and gone tomorrow&permil; has to be in the forefront of thinking when considering digital 
preservation and its technologies. (Try opening a Word 3 document with current equip-
ment and software and compare the results to the original document if one has doubts 
about the challenges.) Beyond these issues lie such things as who controls the material 
and the purpose of the control (revenue generation, for example). While scholars are 
still able to interpret ancient clay tablets and scrolls, opening readable digital files stored 
just 10 years ago is almost impossible today. The fact of the matter is that highly acid 
paper has a longer life span than the uncertain life span of digital files. 
</p>
<p> None of the existing digital preservation methods can guarantee fully readable 
files beyond a decade or two without someone monitoring changes in technology and 
migrating the preservation files to the new technology. Some U.S. government agen-
cies, such as NASA, have found that even when using the appropriate procedures for 
storing data, such as tapes, information is lost. One technique that avoids software and 
platform issues is saving digital material as American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange (ASCII) files. Even that option has two long-term concerns. The most ob-
vious is the fact that ASCII strips out all formatting&middot;for example font differences and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>174 9&mdash;Serials&mdash;Print and Electronic 
</p>
<p>justification. The second concern is the possibility, and given the nature of technology, 
perhaps one with a high probability of occurring, that ASCII will cease to be the ac-
cepted baseline of digital activities. Clearly, digital preservation is more complex than 
paper-based preservation, both in the short and long term. 
</p>
<p> Answering the question about who should be responsible for digital preservation 
is not easy. Four main players should have some responsibility. The originators of the 
content have a vested interest, but few of them have resources to do much beyond 
making backup copies of their work and rarely have time to migrate the material from 
platform to platform. 
</p>
<p> The groups with the greatest resources are the publisher and the vendors who pack-
age and sell access to the information. Because most of them are for-profit entities, their 
focus is on revenue generation (and even not-for profits generally have to break even 
financially), and they have little incentive to retain material that fails to produce income. 
The reality is that long-term storage of very-low-use material will do almost nothing 
positive for the bottom line of such organizations. 
</p>
<p> Individual libraries and cooperative library efforts are the other two groups with a 
strong interest in long-term preservation. In the past, these two groups handled preser-
vation activities and neither originators nor sellers took much notice, but information 
and intellectual property have taken on a significant financial value. As a result, publish-
ers and vendors generally no longer sell the material but rather lease it to libraries and 
place limits on what a library can and cannot do with material&middot;including long-term 
preservation. 
</p>
<p> For digital serials that are subscriptions, that is, not part of a publisher or vendor 
package of serial titles, a library might be allowed to create a &bdquo;dim&permil; or &bdquo;dark&permil; archive 
on its server of material for which it paid the subscription price. (A digital dark archive 
is one that allows no public access to the stored information except under the most ex-
ceptional circumstance&middot;a trigger event&middot;such as the publisher going out of business. 
A dim archive allows some limited public access under less drastic circumstances&middot;
such as an extended period where online access is otherwise unavailable.) According to 
Kenney and colleagues, &bdquo;what librarians really want, in short, is at least a dim archive&middot;
though the level of dimness can vary.&permil; 14  If the activity falls to individual libraries, there 
will likely be costly duplication and probably great holes in the coverage. 
</p>
<p> The best option, and one has been emerging over the past 10 years or so, is co-
operative projects; some just with libraries and a few as partnership of libraries and 
producers. Following are four of the more long-standing cooperatives: 
</p>
<p> &bull; JSTOR&middot;More than 6,000 organizations worldwide participate in JSTOR 
(short for Journal Storage), which was founded in 1995 and archives schol-
arly high-quality academic journals in the humanities, social sciences, and 
sciences, as well as monographs and other materials valuable for academic 
work. The archives are expanded continuously to add international pub-
lications. In 2009, JSTOR merged with and became a service of Ithaka, 
a not-for-profit organization helping the academic community use digital 
technologies to preserve the scholarly record and to advance scholarship 
and teaching in sustainable ways. Libraries pay a rather substantial annual 
fee&middot;tens of thousands of dollars&middot;to participate in the program. See http://
www.jstor.org/page/info/about/organization/ for more details. </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Issues and Concerns 175
</p>
<p> &bull; LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe), based at Stanford University 
Libraries, is an international community initiative that provides libraries 
with digital preservation tools and support so that they can easily and in-
expensively collect and preserve their own copies of authorized e-content 
(http://lockss.stanford.edu/lockss/How_It_Works). As of early 2010, 116 
U.S. and 12 Canadian colleges and universities, as well as institutions 
throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, were taking 
part in the program. This program is based on local libraries storing the 
digital content. Hundreds of publishers have also elected to use LOCKKS 
as their digital preservation and post-cancellation partner. 
</p>
<p> &bull; OCLC&middot;The OCLC Digital Archive is one of many services and prod-
ucts offered by OCLC. It is also a local library digital preservation system 
(http://www.oclc.org/digitalarchive/default.htm). 
</p>
<p> &bull; PubMed Central&middot;The National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of 
Health provides a free digital archive of biomedical and life science journal 
literature (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/). 
</p>
<p> Although beyond the scope of this book, we should mention the concept of insti-
tutional repositories. These are primarily academic library undertakings intended to 
collect and preserve locally produced scholarly material, which is sometimes referred to 
as &bdquo;gray literature&permil;; this includes, for example, drafts of reports and conference papers 
that scholars distribute to each other and are rarely published in the traditional meaning 
of the term. Some libraries are embarking on long-term preservation of locally gener-
ated scholarly material; a process that may soon change the nature of scholarly journal 
publishing. 
</p>
<p> Finally, we suggest that the reader consult Benjamin Abrahamse&Ecirc;s two articles that 
address cataloging issues related to digital preservation. 15  
</p>
<p> Backfiles 
</p>
<p> What is meant by the term &bdquo;backfiles&permil;? Serial backfiles are the collections of previ-
ously published volumes/numbers of the library&Ecirc;s current and past subscriptions. Such 
collections have always been a significant part of modern academic libraries&Ecirc; overall col-
lections. For public, corporate, and school libraries, the size and time frame of such 
collections are generally smaller and shorter in duration, rarely more than a few years. 
</p>
<p> When an academic library starts a subscription to a journal sometime after volume 1, 
number 1, appeared, it must decide how necessary it is to acquire the older (back) 
issues. If there is a perceived need, the library must determine where to acquire the 
material and at what cost. Some serial publishers have full runs available, and many 
Web-based packages offer access to older material for an extra annual fee for the old-
est material. Backfiles of print titles may be available from reprint houses in bound or 
unbound forms. Such material tends to be expensive; they certainly take up valuable 
shelf space and often receive very little use. Libraries also cannot assume that vendors 
handling online full-text serials will maintain backfiles or make them available for all 
titles. Back-issue dealers are also very important when it comes to acquiring copies of 
missing issues that were unavailable from the publisher when claimed and issues that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>176 9&mdash;Serials&mdash;Print and Electronic 
</p>
<p>go missing before a volume can be bound. One source for more popular back issues is 
UsedMagZ.com (http://usedmagz.com). 
</p>
<p> What a library decides to do about print-journal retention is often influenced by 
what exists in digital form and how secure that availability may be long term. Library 
staff members are well aware of the fact that users&Ecirc; preferences are for e-resources (ease 
of access and speed are two major factors in this preference). They are also aware that, 
at present, the e-environment is in a state of constant change, and files available through 
producers or other vendors may not always be there&middot;see the earlier discussion regard-
ing preservation. In 2006 and 2007, Laura Kane McElfresh wrote about libraries going 
e-only for serials. 16  Her academic library decided to move to e-only for subscription 
titles (this did not include titles in multi-title databases). Even with the goal of dropping 
paper titles, the library had a concern with keeping backfiles of the publication available 
to its users for the periods for which it had paid subscriptions. 
</p>
<p> Christina Torbert reported that in her survey of library acquisition of electronic 
backfiles, &bdquo;One of earliest concerns about purchasing journal in electronic-only format 
was a lack of paid-for, tangible backfiles that were guaranteed to remain accessible if 
the current subscription were to be canceled.&permil; 17  She noted, when it came to making the 
acquisition decision that, &bdquo;While there is no published literature specific to choosing 
packages of electronic backfiles, there is a body of literature about purchasing packages 
of electronic journals. It might be supposed that similar criteria and decision-making 
patterns would be followed for purchasing electronic backfiles.&permil; 18  
</p>
<p> Changing Nature 
</p>
<p> Serials change over time as new editors, governing boards, or owners make major 
and minor shifts in the content and orientation. From the acquisitions department point 
of view, a change in a print title is yet another workload issue. It is very important for 
cataloging and the OPAC that there be a clear trail from former to current title whether 
print or electronic. 19  
</p>
<p> For some journals there is a long history of title changes, which can be confusing 
for end-users who may not know of the changes over time and may think the library 
has fewer holdings than it actually does. Steve Black succinctly summed up the library 
view regarding the changing character and titles of serials, noting &bdquo;Since changes in 
title create work for librarians and confusion for patrons, librarians want title changes 
to occur only for compelling reasons.&permil; 20  Although his comment focused on titles, other 
changes also create the issues he mentioned&middot;such as frequency of publication, scope 
of coverage, and, in the case of scholarly journals, even splitting into two titles with 
slightly different coverage. 
</p>
<p> Assessment and Evaluation 
</p>
<p> Assessing or evaluating library collections is, or ought to be, an ongoing activ-
ity, especially for serials that are expensive to acquire and manage. The reality that 
e-resources represent an ever-growing component of the collection and the library&Ecirc;s 
budget has made e-resource evaluation very important. As Borin and Yi noted, &bdquo;there 
is no &Acirc;single&Ecirc; correct way to evaluate collections in today&Ecirc;s complex and changing 
environment.&permil; 21  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Issues and Concerns 177
</p>
<p> For e-resources, several methods are available for assessment. Like other aspects 
of collection assessment, there are both internal and external reasons for conducting an 
evaluation. Perhaps the most common assessment indicator, which can satisfy internal 
or external needs, is value for monies spent. Such issues as usage per title, usage per unit 
cost, and impact on ILL activities apply to both print and e-titles. Some e-title questions 
relate to frequency of downloading versus viewing, e-title impact on print usage, and, 
in the case of package deals, usage of previously unavailable e-titles. 
</p>
<p> Print serial assessment is straightforward and completely in the hands of the library 
staff. How often and what method of data collecting to employ takes time and effort; 
however, when the task is done the library can have a high degree of confidence that the 
data reflect the reality. The situation is less clear-cut in terms of e-titles. 
</p>
<p> What are some of the issues that make assessing e-usage somewhat murky? The 
following list represents a  sample  of the factors that cause e-usage data to be suspect 
from time to time and make comparisons problematic. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Vendors/publishers do not all supply usage data for their product/titles. 
 &bull; Data that are reported vary from vendor/publisher to vendor/publisher. 
 &bull; Some vendors only report cumulative data when the product is a consortia 
</p>
<p>lease. 
 &bull; User behavior&middot;double clicking, moving from an html to a PDF copy of an 
</p>
<p>article for example&middot;can skew the usage data depending on how a vendor/
library counts use. 
</p>
<p> &bull; It is unclear how to count a &bdquo;no hit&permil; search and determine whether it was 
user error or no data. 
</p>
<p> &bull; It is difficult to determine how long usage data will be retained and whether 
the library can download the data and retain it as long necessary. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Product upgrades may or may not retain early usage data. 
 &bull; System crashes often result in lost data. 
</p>
<p> To some extent, libraries can create their own system for measuring usage if they 
have the technological capability. Transaction and Web log analyses can compile data 
about user activity at a Web site or electronic resource the library makes available. 
Network-usage analysis is a broader-scale assessment that focuses on network or 
terminal usage. A library can also create a means through which the user can assess a 
resource&middot;for example, a pop-up box that allows the user to comment on the product 
at the time of use. (This is an online version of a long-standing library assessment 
method&middot;the user survey.) 
</p>
<p> Because of the many challenges to gathering meaningful data about e-resources, 
there has been an effort to bring about some consistency in what vendors and publishers 
supply to libraries. The effort, labeled COUNTER (Counting Online Usage of Net-
worked Electronic Resources), was launched in March 2002 and &bdquo;is an international 
initiative serving librarians, publishers and intermediaries by setting standards that fa-
cilitate the recording and reporting of online usage statistics in a consistent, credible and 
compatible way&permil; (http://www.projectcounter.org/). 
</p>
<p> Following are some other groups that have also been working on improving the 
quality of e-resource assessment: </p>

<p> &bull; ARL New Measures Initiative (http://www.arl.org/stats/initiatives/emetrics/
index.shtml). The ARL (Association of Research Libraries) New Measures 
Initiative was established in response to the following two needs: increasing 
demand for libraries to demonstrate outcomes and impacts in areas impor-
tant to the institution, and increasing pressure to maximize use of resources. 
Of particular interest is the work associated with the E-metrics portion of 
this initiative (http://www.arl.org/stats/initiatives/emetrics/index.shtml), 
which is an effort to explore the feasibility of defining and collecting data 
on the use and value of electronic resources.

<p> &bull; ICOLC Guidelines for Statistical Measures of Usage of Web-based Infor-
mation Resources (http://www.library.yale.edu/consortia/2001webstats.

been in existence since 1996, is an international, informal group currently 
comprising more than 200 library consortia in North America, Australia, 
Asia, and Africa. ICOLC has developed a set of Guidelines for Statistical 
Measures of Usage of Web-based Information Resources. Revised in 2001, 
the guidelines specify a set of minimum requirements for usage data and 
provide guidance on privacy, confidentiality, access, delivery, and report 
formats. 
</p>
<p> &bull; NISO/SUSHI (http://www.niso.org/workrooms/sushi/). NISO is the National 
Information Standards Organization of the United States and SUSHI (Stan-
dardized Usage Harvesting Initiative) is a protocol (Z 39.93&ndash;2007) de-
veloped to facilitate the automated harvesting and consolidation of usage 
statistics from different vendors. 22  
</p>
<p> Assessment of collections, as well as all other library activities, is a component of 
the library&Ecirc;s ability to demonstrate to its various stakeholders its accountability for the 
resources it has been given. Efforts such as those listed in this chapter should be encour-
aged and supported by libraries everywhere. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> Serials have a long history of being a high-demand component of any library&Ecirc;s 
collection. One element in their popularity is their currency of information. Another 
aspect of serials, whether print or electronic, is they represent a major part of a library&Ecirc;s 
collection-development expenditures. 
</p>
<p> Serials, both print and electronic formats, require a significant amount of staff time 
to process, manage, and conserve. Each of the areas have different elements depending 
upon format; however, e-titles generally are more complex to manage. For example, 
preserving print titles is (usually) solely an internal library issue; e-serial preserva-
tion on the other hand usually involves several other parties (authors, publishers, and 
vendors). 
</p>
<p> At present both print and electronic serials play a role in library service. However, 
given the popularity of the e-format with users print titles will probably play less and 
less of a role in the future. </p>

<p>10    Government Information 
</p>
<p> A popular Government without popular information, or the means of acquir-
ing it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or perhaps both. . . . And a 
people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the 
power which knowledge gives. 
</p>
<p> &middot;James Madison, 1822 
</p>
<p> For more than 150 years, the United States Government Printing Office 
(GPO), along with its Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), has sup-
ported an informed citizenry and democracy by ensuring access and preser-
vation to a broad swath of federal government information. 
</p>
<p> &middot;John A. Schuler, Paul T. Jaeger, and John Carlo Bertot, 2010 
</p>
<p> Although nearly 200 years have passed since James Madison wrote his letter re-
garding the need for an informed citizenry, the need for citizens to be informed about 
their government has not diminished. In fact, the need is probably greater today than 
at any time in the past. However, the way people gain access to such information has 
changed dramatically in the past 10 to 15 years. Libraries have always played a role in 
helping people gain such access, and it seems likely they will continue to do so. 
</p>
<p> An example of the importance of accurate information regarding government ac-
tions was the confusion, misinformation, and misinterpretation of what was actually 
proposed in the federal 2010 healthcare reform legislation. At more than 2,000 pages, it 
is no wonder people had trouble understanding its content much less its potential impact 
on themselves and U.S. society. Another example of confusion over fact versus fiction 
occurred after the events of 9/11. Some of the fallout of 9/11, in terms of government 
information, will be covered later in this chapter. 
</p>
<p> Clearly, interest in and concern about society&Ecirc;s access to government information 
has had a long history in the United States, as evidenced in the epigraph by James </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>184 10&mdash;Government Information
</p>
<p>Madison. The issue of open access to government information is a national and a 
worldwide concern. 
</p>
<p> Government information has been, and to large extent still is, a mysterious and 
frequently misunderstood part of the information world. Because government publica-
tions arise out of government action or a perceived need to inform citizens about some 
matter, and appear in either print or digital form, these materials can confuse library 
staff and user alike. Much current information is accessible through the Web, although 
older materials may only be available in a print copy. Online searches, regardless of 
the search engine used, produce thousands of hits for most queries. Where government 
information will appear in the search results is a matter of the search engine&Ecirc;s relevance 
algorithm and the search terms used. Regardless of perceived limitations in locating the 
materials, government information constitutes an important, current, and vital part of 
having an informed citizenry. 
</p>
<p> Government information and publications provide a surprising wealth of informa-
tion on almost any topic. People use various labels for this type of material, such as  gov-
ernment publications, government information, official documents, federal documents, 
agency publications, legislative documents,  and  executive documents.  
</p>
<p> Government information comes in a variety of sizes, shapes, and formats: books, 
technical reports, periodicals, pamphlets, microforms, posters, films, slides, photo-
graphs, CD-ROMs, online databases, audio recordings, and maps. Because such pub-
lications are the product of many diverse branches and agencies of government, they 
have no special subject focus and usually reflect the concerns of the agency that pro-
duced them. Predictably, a document produced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) probably deals with a subject related to agriculture, such as livestock statistics, 
horticulture, or irrigation. However, the relationship may be less direct, because the 
USDA also publishes information about nutrition, forestry, and home economics. As 
remote as the connection may seem, most government publications have some connec-
tion to the issuing agencies&Ecirc; purpose. 
</p>
<p> Libraries store government print and media materials in several ways, ranging from 
a separate collection containing nothing but government publications to complete in-
tegration into the general collection. When the material is segregated from the general 
collection, usage tends to be lower than for material integrated into the collection with 
like topics. In an online environment, it is much easier to access government materials. 
It is interesting that several studies of the use of government information as reflected in 
citations have shown usage remaining constant, even in an Internet world&middot;&bdquo;despite 
this increased visibility and access, the use of physical documents collections and cita-
tion patterns indicate that government material is not being used or cited more frequently 
today than it was in the 1980s.&permil; 1  
</p>
<p> How the library stores these materials affects their technical services processing; 
they may be fully cataloged, partially cataloged, or uncataloged. Documents may be 
classified according to the system used for the other collections (such as the Dewey 
Decimal System or Library of Congress Classification system) or one designed by the 
national government for organizing its publications (in the United States the system is 
the Superintendent of Documents [SuDocs] classification system). 
</p>
<p> Access to these materials varies from special manual indexes to full online public 
access catalog (OPAC) representation. Adding to the confusion created by their diverse 
management, the hard-copy items have only one common trait: they are all official </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Background 185
</p>
<p>products of some government or international body. Thus, many have corporate rather 
than personal author entries (see the cataloging chapters for a discussion of the differ-
ences), which makes it more difficult for users to know how to search for desired mate-
rial. If the material is included in an OPAC, with subject or keyword search capability, 
end-users identify and use more government information than they will if the informa-
tion is only in manual files. 
</p>
<p> The inherent diversity of government agencies and their publications, combined 
with the diverse library management techniques concerning print government docu-
ments, has created something of a bibliographic schizophrenia. However, this immense 
body of information, available at a modest cost or free through the Internet, makes 
government publications and services a worthwhile library information resource, even 
if they are a challenge at times to handle. Making both print and digital versions of 
government information equally accessible to end-users is an ongoing challenge. 
</p>
<p> BACKGROUND 
</p>
<p> In 1813, Congress selected a few U.S. libraries to become part of a system that 
evolved over time into what is now called the Federal Depository Library Program (we 
cover FDLP later in the chapter). The initial program only covered congressional ma-
terials. By 1857, the program had expanded to cover items produced by the executive 
branch. The depository program grew over the next 130 years both in types of mate-
rial distributed and in the number of libraries receiving all or some of the available 
material. 
</p>
<p> At some point, in small steps, the U.S. government decided that citizens not only 
needed access to information about government activities but also needed information 
that would improve the economy or enhance their daily lives. Thus, how-to publications 
on topics such as gardening and carpentry became part of the government&Ecirc;s publishing 
program, and a second purpose of the government publication program evolved: help-
ing people improve the quality of their lives. 
</p>
<p> It is unlikely that the founders of the depository system envisioned that the federal 
government eventually would become the country&Ecirc;s largest publisher or would debate 
which documents should be available to the public. Today, there is a debate about what 
information should be available and the role the government should play in producing 
such publications, and the debate has had some impact on libraries. Morton summa-
rized the situation as follows: 
</p>
<p> The first information obligation of the government of the United States is to 
produce the information it needs to effectively govern, and in so doing pro-
vide accurate information about its activities for itself and so it can be held 
accountable to, and by, its constituents. 
</p>
<p> To accomplish this, the government, libraries, and the press all must, and 
do, play important roles. The government, however, is neither obliged (nor 
should it feel so) to produce, let alone provide it, based on the needs of 
the researchers who occupy the nation&Ecirc;s libraries. One neither disputes the 
needs of these researchers nor their researches. 2  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>186 10&mdash;Government Information
</p>
<p> By the early 1980s, there were more than 1,300 U.S. government document full 
and partial depository libraries. During President Ronald Reagan&Ecirc;s first term in office, 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) received authorization to develop a fed-
eral information policy as the result of the passage of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1980 (Public Law No. 96&ndash;511). The OMB was given the responsibility to minimize the 
cost of collecting, maintaining, using, and disseminating information. 
</p>
<p> One of the OMB&Ecirc;s initiatives supported the concept of disseminating federal in-
formation as raw data in an electronic format. Certainly the OMB&Ecirc;s role in shifting the 
emphasis from paper to electronic means of dissemination was significant. In 1996, 
Congress began debating the Government Printing Reform Act of 1996, the core con-
cept of which was to provide easy access to government information by electronic 
means. 
</p>
<p> Today, documents such as Congressional hearings and legislation are available in 
both print and digital formats. Government agencies at all levels have a Web presence; 
for example, there are more than 30,000 federal Web sites. When one thinks about 
all the state and local government agencies in existence, there are potentially tens of 
thousands of governmental Web sites available, all providing access to information and 
services. A popular press label for this phenomenon is &bdquo;e-government.&permil; 
</p>
<p> E-GOVERNMENT 
</p>
<p> More and more governments, at all levels, are moving toward e-government, and 
libraries, especially public libraries, are playing a role in making e-government more of 
a reality. Donna Blankinship reported on a recent study, funded by the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation, of computer use and libraries. She noted that the study &bdquo;confirms 
what public librarians have been saying as they compete for public dollars to expand 
their services and high speed Internet access: library computer use by the general public 
is widespread and not just among poor people.&permil; 3  The usage is certainly wide ranging, 
and some of the usage is for gaining access to government information. 
</p>
<p> E-government refers to how almost all levels of government are now attempting 
to more actively engage their citizens in the governance process through the use of the 
Internet and technology. Government agencies use the Web to disseminate information 
and provide services. Rose and Grant noted, &bdquo;As the scope of E-Government capa-
bilities has grown and the concept has evolved, the definition of E-Government has 
evolved with it. E-Government is no longer viewed as a simple provision of information 
and services via the internet, but as a way of transforming how citizens interact with 
government.&permil; 4  
</p>
<p>  The Economist  published an 18-page supplement entitled &bdquo;The Electronic Bureau-
crat: A Special Report on Technology and Government.&permil; The introductory essay to the 
supplement ends with the following: 
</p>
<p> Although hopes have been high and the investment has been huge, so far 
the results have mostly been disappointing. That reflects a big difficulty in 
e-government (and in writing about it): it touches on so many other things. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>E-Government 187
</p>
<p>What exactly is it that public organisations are trying to maximise, and how 
can it be measured? 5  
</p>
<p> The report raises several questions: What is the role and purpose of government in-
formation and e-government? And what role can and should libraries play? It turns 
out that libraries, especially public libraries, are playing a significant role in making the 
e-government concept a reality. 
</p>
<p> Although technical services departments are less and less involved in digital gov-
ernment information than when all the information was paper based, they still have 
some role in creating and maintaining links and providing information to users through 
the OPAC. Also, at present, libraries still acquire some paper-based government pub-
lications. 
</p>
<p> The reality is that more libraries are probably more actively engaged in the govern-
ment information dissemination process than at any time in the past. When it was just a 
print world, FDLP libraries were the primary source for government information (many 
of which were academic libraries), and a person had to visit the library to gain access. 
Today, Internet searches provide government information alongside other sources of 
information. What has also changed is that public libraries are now the most active in 
providing people with access to government information. This is largely due to the lim-
its academic libraries must place on outside users when it comes to online access&middot;their 
primary service population consists of their students, faculty, and institutional staff. 
Almost by default, public libraries, because of the open access to their facilities and ser-
vices, have become a major interface between citizens and government information. 
</p>
<p> As government agencies began shifting some of their services to the Web, in some 
cases making it the only means of gaining access to a service, libraries have found 
themselves under growing pressure and absorbing new costs. The costs are for the staff 
time and training that are required to effectively assist users, time that is reallocated 
from other library activities, and expenses related to the equipment and Internet con-
nectivity. Bertot and colleagues made the following observation about the new costs and 
e-government: &bdquo;Yet libraries are increasingly challenged, even as they have stepped up 
to meet the increasing demands for Internet access and services.&permil; 6  Along the same lines, 
in 2009, Jennie Burroughs stated, 
</p>
<p> The strong momentum toward a primarily digital government information 
system has created a new set of challenges for libraries. . . . Information seek-
ers are finding and using government information through more pathways 
than ever before. In many cases, users clamor for improved digital access 
and mainstream findability. On other occasions, users may value traditional 
services and tangible collections. Information seekers&Ecirc; research skills, sub-
ject interests, learning styles, and technological proficiency are extremely 
diverse, which makes it difficult to meet all needs. 7  
</p>
<p> Although Burroughs&Ecirc;s article focused on an academic library, her points about the 
users&Ecirc; diversity of skills and interests apply to all libraries. In a public library setting, 
this diversity becomes very pronounced. When a library provides users with assis-
tance, such as selecting the proper government form, liability concerns quickly come </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188 10&mdash;Government Information
</p>
<p>to the forefront of the library&Ecirc;s thinking about just how much e-government services 
to provide. 
</p>
<p> CATEGORIES OF GOVERNMENT INFORMATION 
</p>
<p> It is not as easy as one might think to define what government information is. 
Clearly, legislative body material or documents produced by the executive branch of 
government, regardless of its level&middot;national to local, are items most people would 
agree fit the concept of government information. However, are reports prepared by non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) but required by a government agency truly govern-
ment publications? What about the publications produced by short-term and long-term 
multi-jurisdictional groups? Usually discussions of government information include 
materials published by the United Nations (UN), which is clearly not a government 
body in the usual meaning of the term. Rather, countries contribute funds to operate the 
UN, including their information and publications program. For our purposes we take 
the broad view that any information that has government involvement, with or without 
direct government funds, falls into the category of government information. 
</p>
<p> U.S. Documents 
</p>
<p> The executive, judicial, and legislative branches, as well as executive cabinet-level 
agencies and independent agencies, all issue documents. Presidential commission re-
ports belong to this class of publications, as do the budget documents. Cabinet-level 
departments (e.g., the USDA or the Department of the Interior) include administrative 
units, such as agencies and bureaus. Most of these units issue reports, regulations, sta-
tistics, and monographs; many issue educational and public relations materials as well. 
In addition to cabinet-level agency publications, many independent agencies release 
a range of information. The Tennessee Valley Authority, Federal Reserve Board, and 
Central Intelligence Agency are examples of independent agencies that also publish 
documents. 
</p>
<p> Judicial documents (aside from case-law reports) are not as numerous as those from 
the other two branches of government. The best known and most important title is the 
 Supreme Court Reports,  which contains Supreme Court opinions and decisions. (Note: 
Private commercial publishers issue the decisions of lower federal courts; these are not 
normally considered government documents.) Although large legal libraries must have 
a set of the  Supreme Court Reports,  other libraries may also find them useful for histori-
cal and political reasons. As a result, many larger public and academic libraries acquire 
a set for the general collection, even when there is a good legal library nearby. 
</p>
<p> Congressional publications are second in number and popularity only to executive 
publications. In addition to the text of proposed and passed legislation, these publi-
cations include materials documenting House and Senate deliberations. Floor debates 
appear in the  Congressional Record;  assessments of the need for legislation are avail-
able in congressional committee reports; testimony before congressional committees 
appears in documents that bear the words  Hearings of  or  Hearings on;  and there are 
also several important reference books, such as  Official Congressional Directory, Sen-
ate Manual,  and  House Rules.  The  Congressional Record  provides a semi-verbatim </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Categories of Government Information 189
</p>
<p>transcript of the proceedings on the floor of each house of Congress (semi-verbatim 
because it is possible for a congressperson to add or delete material in the  Congressio-
nal Record.  Thus, it is not a completely accurate record of what actually transpired on 
the floor of Congress). Many libraries, including large public libraries, find that there is 
a strong demand for access to the  Congressional Record.  Luckily, online access to re-
cent issues of the  Congressional Record  is available through the Library of Congress&Ecirc;s 
THOMAS system (http://thomas.loc.gov/home/cr_help.htm). 
</p>
<p> The Government Printing Office (GPO, http://www.gpoaccess.gov) as noted ear-
lier provides the largest range of U.S. government information. 
</p>
<p> State and Local Governments 
</p>
<p> Several differences exist between state and federal information in the United States. 
One difference, as of 2010, is that there is a stronger print orientation at the state and 
local level, although the most state governments have at least some Web presence. A 
second, and often overlooked, difference is that states can and frequently do copyright 
their publications. Some shared characteristics between state and federal information 
are the diversity of subject matter, relatively low purchase price, and increasing dif-
ficulty in identifying what is an official publication. 
</p>
<p> Like the federal publishing program, most state programs now produce materials 
mandated by law; that is, they record government activities and release a variety of 
statistical data and general information about the state. Many of the federal statistical 
publications are compilations of state data, which means the most current information, 
by as much as two or three years, is in the state publications. The volume of general 
information and how-to publications from states is low compared with federal output. 
</p>
<p> Access to, and identification of, state and local publications was difficult in the 
past. Today it is much easier as sites such as GovEngine.com (http://www.govengine.
com) provide links to state and local information online, which has greatly enhanced 
access. The Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/rr/news/stategov/stategov.html) 
also provides links to state government Web sites and some local government sites. Yet 
another service is the State and Local Government on the Net Web site (http://www.
statelocalgov.net/). 
</p>
<p> Depository practices and requirements differ from state to state. The statutes of any 
particular state will provide the frequency and the statutory framework of the deposi-
tory program. The state library can provide more detailed information about its state 
depository program, including a list of depositories, sales and acquisition information, 
and information about which materials are available from a central source and which 
are available only from individual agencies. 
</p>
<p> In the past, it was a major challenge for libraries to provide much access to local 
government information, even for the library &rsquo; s own local government. With Web ac-
cess, a person can not only find a surprising amount of information about her home 
town government but can also compare what is happening locally with what is happen-
ing with other local governments. 
</p>
<p> Public libraries still make an effort to collect and preserve local government in-
formation, at least when it is available in a print format. The challenges of preserving 
the digital material is usually well beyond the technological and staffing resources of a 
local library. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>190 10&mdash;Government Information
</p>
<p> Canadian Government information 
</p>
<p> Types of government documents in Canada are similar to those in the United States. 
Canadian Government Publishing is the official publisher of federal documents (http://
canada.gc.ca/publications/publication-eng.html or http://publications.gc.ca/). For many 
years the annual, quarterly, and weekly listings of federal government publications ap-
peared in book format. However, in the 1980s and early 1990s the annual and the quar-
terly lists disappeared, leaving the weekly lists, which now are found both in a paper 
format and on the aforementioned government Web site. 
</p>
<p> Provincial governments also list their publications on their Web sites. In addition, 
many provinces have bookstores where their publications can be purchased or designate 
independent bookstores to sell their publications. 
</p>
<p> Documents from Other Countries 
</p>
<p> In many countries, the government publication programs are similar to the Cana-
dian and U.S. programs in terms of volume and complexity. The good news is that these 
large-scale programs generally have an agency, like the U.S. GPO, that is the primary 
distributor of the publications. Very few countries offer a depository program to librar-
ies in other countries. Only the large research libraries actively collect such documents 
because few users need the material. 
</p>
<p> International documents, especially UN publications, however, do have a wider 
appeal. Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) are the major source of international 
publications and information. An IGO may be defined as a group of three or more mem-
ber countries working together on one or more long-term, common interests. Without 
doubt, the largest IGO is the UN. NGOs such as the World Health Organization (http://
www.who.int/en/) also issue publications and information of interest to a fairly large 
number of library users. 
</p>
<p> The UN has an extensive publications program and, like other government bodies, 
is beginning to issue material in electronic formats. The UN Web site provides a broad 
range of information about the organization (https://unp.un.org/), which includes order-
ing information. The site also has a listing of all UN depository libraries worldwide. For 
most libraries that have some UN documents, the material is part of the regular collec-
tion, circulating or reference, rather than being held in a separate document area, simply 
because they do not acquire very many titles. 
</p>
<p> Although very few countries offer depository arrangements for libraries in other 
countries, some do allow libraries to establish a deposit account. Variations in exchange 
rates, however, often cause problems about how much money is available in an account. 
One method that works, if a library wishes to buy a substantial number of publica-
tions from a country, is to have a book dealer or vendor in the country purchase the doc-
uments. 
</p>
<p> Library staff members who work regularly with government information believe 
better and more frequent use of print government material would benefit most users. 
They believe that if people understood the broad range of information and subjects 
available, usage would increase. 
</p>
<p> Two factors work against increased usage. First, in depository collections, the lack 
of full cataloging for all received items means users interested in accessing such items </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Access to Government Information 191
</p>
<p>often cannot find them using the OPAC. The high volume of material received is a major 
factor in not fully cataloging depository items. Second, if depository items are not fully 
cataloged, libraries normally establish a separate area to house the items. Frequently, 
government documents collections reside in a corner or basement of the library with the 
lowest volume of traffic. The old saying &bdquo;out of sight, out of mind&permil; is all too true about 
government documents. The Library and Archives Canada, however, provides cata-
loging copy in its free AMICUS service (http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/amicus/
index-e.html) for all items chosen for depository. This cataloging is completed by the 
time the items are distributed. 
</p>
<p> ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION 
</p>
<p> Suzanne Piotrowski&Ecirc;s book on government and its services suggests that there are 
four primary means by which people gain access to government information: 
</p>
<p> &bull; From agency press releases, documents posted online, or through libraries/
depositories, 
</p>
<p> &bull; Through responses to formal user requests, often based on the Freedom of 
Information Act process, 
</p>
<p> &bull; From leaks or whistle-blower statements, and 
 &bull; Through town hall meetings and other public hearings. 8  
</p>
<p> In this chapter the focus is just on the first category. 
 In the not-too-distant past, print documents provided critical information and li-
</p>
<p>braries filled two roles: acquiring government material and providing assistance in ac-
cessing the information. Today, there is a vast universe of such information available 
through the Internet. A significant difference exists between the two means of access. 
</p>
<p> Since 9/11, the U.S. federal government has rethought what and how much govern-
ment information ought to be available to the general public. With paper documents, 
you may not have the most current information, but you know that what you are look-
ing at has not been modified by some unknown, perhaps third nongovernment party. 
Also, a paper document is not likely to vanish in the blink of an eye. Neither is true 
of the digital format. Kathy Dempsey&Ecirc;s editorial entitled &bdquo;The Info Was There, 
Then ____ Poof  &permil; sums up the issue of permanence and digital information. Her edito-
rial prefaced a themed issue dealing with government information, in which she high-
lighted a key concern; &bdquo;Where do you draw the line between which data should be 
public and which should be kept private?&permil; 9  We might add &bdquo;and who should make that 
critical call?&permil; Dempsey related how one of the articles intended for that issue went &bdquo;poof  &permil; 
when the White House requested a final review process. (The authors of the article in 
question worked in a federal information center and their piece was to describe the 
factors that determine what information is deemed classified.) In another article, Klein 
and Schwal discussed the delicate balance society must achieve between maintaining 
free access to information and security, if its citizens are to effectively participate in a 
meaningful democracy. 10  
</p>
<p> When it was just a print world, the process of gaining access to government infor-
mation was complex and often painfully slow. Libraries and their staff were an essential </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>192 10&mdash;Government Information
</p>
<p>part of the process. Something that is frequently overlooked in the debate about security 
and access is the fact that depository libraries (the largest holders of print government 
publications) do not  own  the material. Although they invest significant sums of money 
in the long-term storage of the material and in staff effort to servicing the collections, 
they do not have ownership. The government can and has at various times withdrawn 
material from depository collections&middot;that process is not just a post-9/11 phenomenon. 
Further, it can do so without consultation and libraries have no recourse. 
</p>
<p> Klein and Schwal (who themselves are federal government employees) in their 
concluding section made the following points; &bdquo;Newly generated government informa-
tion will be evaluated against established criteria for review for public release, the same 
as always. There is no core group making these decisions, although there may be a 
tendency on the part of those responsible to err on the side of caution.&permil; 11  
</p>
<p> Accessing U.S. Government Information 
</p>
<p> One of the early efforts to provide digital access to U.S. federal government docu-
ments was the Government Information Locator Service (GILS). GILS was created in 
1994 to provide a user-oriented system that would help users identify digital federal in-
formation. The system was not just a GPO system; as a result, more than 30 GILS serv-
ers were located across government agencies. The system was shut down in September 
2008, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office plans to have all the old records 
(from December 7, 1994 through September 2, 2008) converted to the new system, 
called the Federal Digital System, or FDsys, some time in 2010. (For more details about 
GILS and materials contained in the system, see http://www.gils.net. Information about 
FDsys may be found at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/home.action.) 
</p>
<p> Currently, what is perhaps the most user-friendly site for accessing U.S. Federal 
government information is the portal USA.gov, which is called the &bdquo;U.S. Government&Ecirc;s 
Official Web Portal&permil; (http://www.usa.gov). In addition to the expected search box at the 
top of the page, the home page offers an Explore Topics tab listing a set of broad topical 
selections (such as &bdquo;Consumer Guides&permil; and &bdquo;Health and Nutrition&permil;) that provide links 
to government information on the topic from any agency. There is also a Find Govern-
ment Agencies tab that has links to the three main branches of government and their 
agencies, to online sites for the states and U.S. territories, local jurisdictions, and tribal 
governments. The state, local, and tribal pages also offer more search options than fed-
eral government&ndash;generated information. 
</p>
<p> Preservation of Government Information 
</p>
<p> Preservation issues for government information are the same as for the general col-
lection. Paper-based government publications are just as likely to be on acidic paper as 
their commercial cousins. There was, in 1990, a congressional resolution to encourage, 
if not require, all publishers to use acid-free paper for important publications. Nonprint 
government materials also suffer from the same problems as their commercial counter-
parts, for example, poor processing&middot;especially microformats&middot;and poor bonding of 
the emulsion layer to the carrier film base in photographs and motion picture film. All 
of these materials need the same care in handling by staff and users as well as the ap-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Federal Depository Library Program 193
</p>
<p>propriate environmental controls (temperature and humidity) as those items discussed 
in other chapters. 
</p>
<p> Like their digital serial counterparts, e-government documents face challenges re-
lated to how to and who should ensure long-term preservation of the material. As would 
be expected, national libraries and archives undertake almost all of the work related to 
national government&ndash;generated material. When it comes to state and local jurisdictions, 
however, the issue is much less clear. All levels of government are currently facing 
major budgetary challenges. Neither academic nor public libraries are funded or staffed 
at a level for anyone to realistically expect them to take on the work of preserving 
government-generated e-documents. 
</p>
<p> One example of a province-focused project to preserve e-material is from Ontario, 
Canada. Rea Devakos and Annemarie Toth-Waddell describe a joint effort by the On-
tario Legislative Library and the Ontario Council of University Libraries to preserve 
electronic government documents using the D-Space system. 12  
</p>
<p> The challenge of preserving state, local, and multi-jurisdictional e-material 
grows greater each day. How society and its libraries will resolve the issue remains to 
be seen. 
</p>
<p> FEDERAL DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAM 
</p>
<p> As noted earlier, the concept of a national system of libraries holding government 
documents has a long history. Certainly, there has been success in getting government 
information into libraries across the nation where the public has reasonably conve-
nient access to the material. There are two types of depository libraries, full and selective. 
A full depository agrees to accept all items available to FDLP participants (essentially 
those materials handled by the GPO; selective institutions take only a portion of the 
material). The selective libraries are encouraged to take at least 15 percent of the items 
available&middot;the depository program does  not  include all publications issued by federal 
agencies and organizations. A list of member libraries is available from the GPO Web 
site (http://catalog.gpo.gov/fdlpdir/FDLPdir.jsp). 
</p>
<p> At one time there were 1,365 depository libraries in the United States, but as of 
2010 the number had dropped to 1,250. The number has been declining over the past 
15 years because many libraries that were selective members dropped out of the pro-
gram as collection space and staffing problems grew and electronic access increased. 
</p>
<p> The composition of the FDLP is heavily weighted toward academic libraries (50%), 
with public libraries a distant second (20%). The balance consists of academic law li-
braries (11%), community college libraries (5%), 5 state and special libraries (5%), 
federal and state court libraries (5%), and federal agency libraries (4%). Many people 
view academic libraries as intimidating, so the growing number of public libraries of-
fering e-government access should increase usage of government information as people 
are often more comfortable in a public library setting. 
</p>
<p> A thoughtful reader may wonder about the costs associated with being a depository 
library. A study by Robert Dugan and Ellen Dodsworth indicated that the Georgetown 
University library expended $217,970 in direct, support, and overhead costs on its de-
pository program. 13  One can only wonder what the costs would be in 2010. For smaller 
depository programs, the dollar costs would be much smaller, but the proportions of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>194 10&mdash;Government Information
</p>
<p>depository costs to total operating expenses would likely be very similar. There is no 
question that there are substantial dollar and staff costs associated with depository sta-
tus. For at least some selective depositories, those costs and related issues caused them 
to rethink the value of being a selective depository, especially in terms of technical 
services staff time and steadily shrinking collection storage space. 
</p>
<p> As the federal government moves toward increasing dependence on electronic dis-
semination of information, the following types of questions are being raised: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Is the FDLP still necessary? 
 &bull; Is the FDLP a remnant of the 19th century? 
 &bull; Is the FDLP the best way to get information to people in the 21st century? 
 &bull; Is there a way to change the system to make it more cost-effective? 
</p>
<p> Peter Hernon and Laura Saunders, in writing about the future of the FDLP concluded, 
&bdquo;Finally, by 2023, there might be a new future that involves a decentralized network 
of libraries.&permil; 14  
</p>
<p> At the same time the Hernon and Saunders article appeared, the Depository Li-
brary Council released a draft strategic plan covering 2009&ndash;2014. That document made 
the point, &bdquo;At the same time, any strategic vision needs to embrace new ways of col-
laboration and partnership among depositories and with GPO. This cooperation may 
include ways of building and sustaining future digital collections of published Federal 
information sources, but it also must include the deliberative preservation of significant 
paper and print collections of Federal information.&permil; 15  One of the concluding points of 
the strategic plan was that, &bdquo;The successful model will be a careful blend of the pro-
gram&Ecirc;s traditional accessibility and technological innovation.&permil; 16  As of 2010, it appears 
that the FDLP program will continue for some years, but in a very different form. How 
the changes will affect technical services activities related to government information 
remains to be seen. 
</p>
<p> A reminder: any depository library, partial or full,  must  allow anyone access to 
the federal documents, regardless of the library&Ecirc;s policies about public use of its other 
collections. (The U.S. Code, Title 44, &sect; 1911 [1944] states, &bdquo;Depository libraries shall 
make government publications available for free use of the general public.&permil;) The federal 
depository library system has developed the  FDL Handbook  (http://www.fdlp.gov/
administration/handbook), which includes guidelines for access to materials (http://
www.fdlp.gov/administration/handbook/116-chapter4?start=2). If the library restricts 
public access to its general collections and few people request access to the documents 
collection, staff members, especially new staff, may unknowingly deny legally required 
access. 
</p>
<p> Another depository requirement is that there is a library staff member primarily 
responsible for handling the depository material. Very often when there is just one 
person, the staff member is part of the technical services section because of the high 
volume of record keeping and processing associated with maintaining a documents 
collection. FDLP members have an obligation to promote their federal information col-
lections and services. The  FDL Handbook  states that when it comes to promotion, the 
outreach &bdquo;should be ongoing and increase visibility of the depository, depository re-
sources, and depository services&permil; (http://www.fdlp.gov/administration/handbook/116-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Acquisition of Government Information 195
</p>
<p>chapter4?start=5). As a result, the library&Ecirc;s primary service population may not be the 
target group the GPO is interested in reaching. 
</p>
<p> Another aspect of the depository program is mandated retention. Adequate collec-
tion space is a chronic problem in most libraries. One method for gaining space is dese-
lecting material from the collection. A traditional weeding or deselection technique is to 
remove the lowest-use items and store them in less expensive space or discard the mate-
rial. Government publications more often than not fall into the very low-use category; 
nevertheless, the depository may not be as quick to remove these items as it might be 
with low-use purchased materials. All depository libraries must retain items for at least 
five years after receipt. Regional (i.e., full) depositories  must  retain their collections, 
and selective depositories must offer items identified as discards to the regional library 
and local partial depositories before discarding them (http://www.fdlp.gov/administra 
tion/handbook/392-chapter5?start=14). On the plus side, periodic reviews of the docu-
ments collection may also encourage a review of the general collection low-use items 
that also occupy valuable shelf space. 
</p>
<p> CANADIAN DEPOSITORY PROGRAMS 
</p>
<p> There are 271 full and selective depositories for Canadian federal government 
documents in Canada, and one each in 38 countries around the world. The Depository 
Services Program Web site describes the system as follows: 
</p>
<p> Full depository status is granted to Canadian libraries that are nominated and 
approved by a Committee consisting of representatives of the National Li-
brary of Canada and the Depository Services Program. This status is granted 
as either English, or French, or bilingual, depending on the clientele of the 
library in question. Full Depository Libraries automatically receive a ship-
ment of  all  publications listed for distribution by the Program in the  Weekly 
Checklist  of Canadian government publications for that week. 
</p>
<p> All other depositories have the status of selective depository. Selective 
depository libraries use the  Weekly Checklist  to  choose  those items they are 
entitled to order. Selective depository status is granted to Canadian public li-
braries and libraries of Canadian educational institutions which are open to the 
general public or clientele at least twenty hours per week and have at least one 
full-time employee. (http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Depo/table-e.html) 
</p>
<p> Canadian provincial governments also provide depository programs. For example, 
Ontario only has selective depositories. Ontario used to publish a weekly checklist but 
now publishes its checklist on its Web site under the heading &bdquo;New Releases.&permil; 
</p>
<p> ACQUISITION OF GOVERNMENT INFORMATION 
</p>
<p> Even if a library is a full depository, it will still need to acquire some paper-based 
government documents in the traditional manner as not all material is available through 
GPO. Documents librarians have always known that FDLP does not provide complete </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>196 10&mdash;Government Information
</p>
<p>coverage of federal material. A U.S. General Accounting Office report,  Information 
Management: Electronic Dissemination of Government Publications,  found that 50 per-
cent of all the federal documents published in 1996 were not indexed, cataloged, or 
disseminated to the depository libraries (http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d01428.pdf  ). A 
more recent study has not been conducted; however, it seems probable that the problem 
persists. Thus, a substantial amount of acquisitions work is still required, at least for 
FDLP members. 
</p>
<p> Many documents are available free from issuing agencies and congressional rep-
resentatives. They are also available as gifts or exchanges from libraries that have held 
them for the statutory period and wish to dispose of them or from other libraries with 
extra nondepository copies. Another common method of acquisition is purchase through 
the agency&Ecirc;s official sales program. The agency may or may not offer a standing order 
program. Some commercial jobbers and bookstores deal in government documents, 
and some booksellers, especially used or rare booksellers, may stock some government 
documents. 
</p>
<p> To locate GPO federal material, the source to consult is the Catalog of U.S. 
Government Publications (http://catalog.gpo.gov) the successor to the  Monthly Cat-
alog . Another resource is GPO&Ecirc;s Online Paper Store (http://www.gpo.gov/customers/
store.htm). 
</p>
<p> One large commercial vendor of government documents is Bernan Associates of 
Maryland. As noted on its Web site: 
</p>
<p> Bernan is a leading distributor of essential publications from the United 
States government and intergovernmental organizations, and a respected 
publisher of critically acclaimed reference works based on government data. 
The two businesses are intertwined; for ease of description, we will describe 
them as distinct activities. 
</p>
<p> Bernan offers easy, one-stop access to a world of government and inter-
national agency books, journals, and CD-ROMs for academic and public 
libraries in the U.S., as well as law and corporate libraries. (http://www.
bernan.com/General/About_Bernan.aspx) 
</p>
<p> Bernan Associates handles federal documents and offers several standing-order 
programs. 
</p>
<p> Through the UN Publications Web site (https://unp.un.org/), a library may acquire 
items issued by such entities as the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), as well as other UN and international organization publications. While of-
fering no depository plan, it does have a deposit account service for libraries allowed by 
their parent organization to establish an account of this type: 
</p>
<p> Any customer, non-account or account holder, wishing to establish a deposit 
account should submit their request in writing. A minimum initial deposit of 
US$500.00 should be maintained. Upon receipt of your deposit, an account 
number will be assigned. . . . All prices are quoted in US dollars, prices are 
subject to change without notice. Shipping and handling fee will be added 
to each order. Special shipping instructions can usually be accommodated </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Review Questions 197
</p>
<p>and these will be charged on an individual basis. Discounts are offered to 
wholesalers, retailers and agents. (https://unp.un.org/Librarians.aspx) 
</p>
<p> Standing order and subscription services are also available. In addition, some titles 
are available online. A full listing of agencies that release their publications through this 
program is available online (https://unp.un.org/Agency.aspx). 
</p>
<p> Some U.S. congressional publications, such as hearings and committee reports, 
and a few agency publications, may be obtained by contacting the local or Washington, 
D.C., offices of congressional representatives. Obviously, this is not an appropriate ac-
quisitions technique for large quantities or standing orders, but it can be quite effective 
for current issues or special subject publications. It is especially effective for acquiring 
information about current legislation or information covering a wide range of subjects. 
School and media centers should take advantage of this source of free government doc-
uments. The best method for acquiring recently out-of-print or nonsales publications is 
to contact the issuing agency directly. The annual  United States Government Manual 
 (http://www.gpoaccess.gov/gmanual/browse.html) provides a list of addresses, tele-
phone numbers, and e-mail addresses for the major and minor agencies of the federal 
government. Individual contact can produce copies of many federal documents, often 
free of charge. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> Government information is an important element in any library&Ecirc;s collection or ser-
vice program. It is important for citizens to have such information easily available, 
even if people do not use it heavily. All types of libraries can acquire useful information 
from government agencies at a reasonable cost. However, securing and processing the 
desired material can present significant challenges for technical services units. 
</p>
<p> REVIEW QUESTIONS 
</p>
<p>  1. How has the Internet changed access to government information? 
</p>
<p>  2. What role do public libraries play in helping citizens interact with their gov-
ernments? 
</p>
<p>  3. What are some of the issues related to the need to maintain the delicate bal-
ance between security and access? 
</p>
<p>  4. What types of information can you locate on the Internet about your home 
town government? How does that compare to what you can find out about 
you state government? 
</p>
<p>  5. Where would you look for information about UNESCO programs on the In-
ternet? The World Health Organization&Ecirc;s publication program? 
</p>
<p>  6. What do you see as the future of the FDLP? How will changes in the FDLP 
affect other libraries? </p>

<p> Banks of CDs for borrowing may slowly disappear from libraries in the years 
ahead, but the idea of lending music to patrons is still very much alive.

</p>
<p> Playing games in today&Ecirc;s public and school libraries is a profoundly social 
experience for library patrons both young and old. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Dale Lipschulz, 2009 
</p>
<p> It appears that we are beginning to enter what some have called the &bdquo;post-literate 
age.&permil; Jones-Kavalier and Flannigan noted, &bdquo;Prior to the 21st century,  literate  defined a 
person&Ecirc;s ability to read and write, separating the educated from the uneducated. With 
the advent of the new millennium and the rapidity with which technology has changed 
society, the concept of literacy has assumed new meanings.&permil; 1  Doug Johnson has sug-
gested that a post-literate society is one in which a person can read and write but 
chooses to gather information and learn through &bdquo;audio, video, graphics, and gaming.&permil; 2  
Allan Rough, in writing about nonprint media services at the University of Maryland, 
noted that the Bantu of Africa employ a single word,  kunzwa , to mean &bdquo;to see, to hear, 
to understand.&permil; 3  He used the translated meaning as the motto for his new media services 
facilities and placed it on the wall just inside the entrance. 
</p>
<p> One interesting challenge for society and libraries is the fact that students, from pre-
school to postgraduate work, are being taught by teachers who, on average, are very 
much less literate than their students in terms of today&Ecirc;s digital technologies. The stu-
dents have grown up in a world in which digital technology is just there; it is not some-
thing they had to try to learn about later in life. The students are what Prensky calls 
&bdquo;digital natives,&permil; and their teachers and other elders are &bdquo;digital immigrants&permil; who are 
trying to become literate in the new systems of communication and learning. 4  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>202 11&mdash;Media
</p>
<p> Johnson suggested that we need to recreate our libraries for the needs of the post-
literate society: &bdquo;The term &Acirc;postliterate library&Ecirc; may appear to be an oxymoron at first 
glance, but it is not true. Our best libraries are already postliterate, increasingly meeting 
the needs of users who communicate, play, and learn using media other than print.&permil; 5  
Indeed libraries have been adding nonprint items to their collections for many years. It 
is highly unlikely that 20 years ago many of the advocates for media in libraries were 
thinking about a post-literate society, but they did recognize that many people learn and 
communicate more effectively through nonprint means. 
</p>
<p> For some time there were two schools of thought within the profession regarding 
media&Ecirc;s role, or lack thereof, in libraries. Some librarians held that that media formats 
distract libraries from their primary mission&middot;the promotion of lifelong reading&middot;
especially the reading of quality literary titles. Further, such collections drain essential 
resources from print material. Essentially, such people viewed libraries as being in the 
&bdquo;book&permil; rather than the &bdquo;information&permil; business. Will Manly suggested that, &bdquo;Videos are 
the &Acirc;Twinkies&Ecirc; of library collections.&permil; 6  
</p>
<p> Others, Sally Mason for example, held the view that media formats are as central 
to collections as print materials; &bdquo;Clearly, the visual media will only become more 
important to library service in the future. . . . It is not enough for librarians to &Acirc;capitu-
late&Ecirc; on the issue of visual media. We must become leaders and advocates . . . helping 
the public to learn what is available, to sort through multiple possibilities, and offer-
ing guidance in the use of media to obtain needed information.&permil; 7  Likewise, Myra Brown 
suggested, &bdquo;It is counterproductive to stigmatize one format while deifying print. We 
dilute our energy by imposing such artificial distinctions.&permil; 8  
</p>
<p> Regardless of differences in philosophy, various nonprint formats have been pres-
ent in libraries for the better part of 100 years. (Music recording were one of the first 
nonprint items added to library collections.) Media resources have been an interesting, 
varied, and challenging component of collections. In today&Ecirc;s digital environment, they 
remain interesting and challenging, if perhaps not as varied as in the past. 
</p>
<p> Today, almost all academic, public, and school libraries have at least some small 
collection of nonprint items. There is also a general recognition that other media play an 
important role in having an informed society. Anyone reading  Publishers Weekly  ( PW         ) 
or shopping on Amazon.com knows that publishers and booksellers no longer limit 
themselves to just books and magazines. They see themselves as being in the informa-
tion business. Regular columns in  PW  on audio and video releases indicate that pro-
ducers and vendors view this field as an important market. The use of computerized 
typesetting and scanning equipment, which produces a record of the text in a digital 
format, opened up a number of options for delivering the information, such as the Kin-
dle and Nook e-readers. 
</p>
<p> All one has to do is think about the growth of Web 2.0 and sites like MySpace and 
YouTube to realize the importance of visuals and interaction to youth. Social media 
or social networking is a tool for sharing one&Ecirc;s personnel experiences through text, vi-
suals, and sound. A library of any type that ignores social media does so at its peril, at 
least from a long-term point of view. For effective outreach, libraries need to focus their 
communication on &bdquo;people like us&permil; rather than the traditional top-down organizational 
format. Digitization has to a large degree made some of the old media formats less sig-
nificant. However, for the near term, libraries will have legacy media collections that 
contain material that is not available in a digital form. </p>
<p/>

<p>Current Media Formats 203
</p>
<p> The bottom line is that technology has reduced media to its basic of visual and au-
dio, but from the staff perspective, it has done so in more complex ways than in the past. 
As Howard Story wrote, &bdquo;Many of us long for the way we were or what we think were 
simpler days. Phonograph records, audio cassettes, film, color television, video cassettes, 
all at one time were classified as new technology and during their introduction caused 
someone great anxiety. Digital technology is no different.&permil; 9  
</p>
<p> MEDIA ISSUES 
</p>
<p> Media formats present several challenges for the library and its acquisitions depart-
ment budget. Unlike print materials, in most cases media formats require some type of 
equipment in order to access their content. Thus, there is the both the cost of buying the 
equipment and the cost of maintaining it on an ongoing basis. Failure to maintain the 
equipment will damage the medium used with it, which is much more fragile than paper-
based content. There is also, at times, an issue of equipment compatibility when order-
ing new titles (such as DVD or Blu-ray). 
</p>
<p> Because media items are generally used with equipment, they wear out or are dam-
aged more quickly than print materials, especially when the public may check them 
out for home use. Replacement costs are substantial for many formats; for example, li-
braries circulating video formats expect to get fewer than 25 circulations before the title 
is too worn to remain in circulation. 
</p>
<p> Also, unlike print, some media, such as video, often have restrictions on how they 
may be used, especially where the material may be used in a public setting. There is 
a concept called &bdquo;performance rights&permil; that does impact library usage&middot;more about this 
later in the chapter. 
</p>
<p> One ongoing issue for libraries and acquisitions budgets is the speed of techno-
logical change. Those working with end-users have to keep pondering the question, 
&bdquo;How many times must we purchase a copy of Beethoven&Ecirc;s Fifth Symphony or the 
movie  Gone With the Wind ?&permil; Since the 1960s, the music recording collections have 
moved from vinyl disks (in several different sizes and speeds) to cassettes (in several 
variations) to CDs. A similar series of changes took place in terms of motion pictures&middot;
film (16mm and 8mm) to cassette (VHS and Beta) to DVD and now Blu-ray. Changes 
in technology leave libraries with legacy collections of items many users view as dino-
saurs. Moving too quickly into a format (for example Beta) that does not last is a waste 
of funds, yet waiting too long can also be costly, if for no other reason than losing 
users&Ecirc; goodwill and support. 
</p>
<p> Long-term preservation of media is not a significant issue for most libraries&middot;the 
material wears out quickly and the equipment changes very fast as well&middot;but there are 
short-term issues related to wear, damage, and security. Those concerns will be touched 
on later in the chapter. 
</p>
<p> CURRENT MEDIA FORMATS 
</p>
<p> As stated previously, a given in media services is changing formats, which will 
keep your work life interesting. The pace of change of 40 years ago now seems slower </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>than a snail&Ecirc;s, while today&Ecirc;s pace seems to be light speed. Alan Kaye wrote, &bdquo;Now pic-
ture and sound seem to having their way with computers and the Internet. Multimedia 
information has become almost native to computers, collapsing the market for analog 
formats and creating a digital world.&permil; 10  He went on to discuss how libraries like his 
have already eliminated or are in the process of eliminating filmstrips, slide sets, 16mm 
and 8mm films, Super 8mm films, and all phonograph records and music audiocas-
settes. Not all libraries have gone that far, and many still have some legacy collections. 
Thus, we briefly mention such formats in what follows; if you are interested in more 
information about such formats, consult the previous edition of this book. 
</p>
<p> Motion Pictures and Video 
</p>
<p> Most libraries have weeded or are weeding their film collections in terms of 16mm 
and 8mm formats. About the only environment in which such films are found are spe-
cial collections and archives. Like many of the other formats covered in this chapter, 
film content has migrated to a digital form (DVDs and increasingly to streaming video). 
Videocassettes (VHS) are still in collections and are available for purchase, primarily 
because much of the content is not yet available in a digital form. 
</p>
<p> Format battles in the video field have been ongoing for some years now. One well-
known battle was between Beta and VHS, with VHS the winner. A more recent struggle 
was between DVD, Blu-ray, and HD-DVD. By 2008, the HD-DVD format had fallen 
out of the contest. Libraries are once again caught in the middle of a commercial battle 
where they must bet on a winning side or spend limited funds duplicating the same con-
tent in competing formats. The issue is that a DVD player cannot play a Blu-ray disk; 
however, most Blu-ray players can play the older DVD format. Although prices for Blu-
ray players have fallen, less than 10 percent of U.S. households had a Blu-ray player 
by late 2009, 11  so there was not too much demand from users for libraries to offer ti-
tles in this format. 
</p>
<p> Notwithstanding the Blu-ray issue, most libraries have substantial collections of 
VHS material and DVDs. According to Norman Oder in late 2005, many libraries were 
still purchasing VHS cassettes in large numbers. 12  By 2007, DVDs had overtaken VHS, 
at least for feature film titles. &bdquo;Part of the growth in the DVD era comes down to sim-
ple economics. They can buy more movies with their budgets than they could in the VHS 
era.&permil; 13  Most of the video circulation comes from movies in the public library setting 
while curriculum-related videos dominate educational library usage. However, the ac-
quisitions patterns vary greatly as some public libraries believe they compete with lo-
cal video rental outlets if they offer movie titles, as do the rental stores. Another factor 
is that DVDs require even less shelf or storage space per title. 
</p>
<p> Given the quick release of DVDs after a film is in theaters, DVD collections gen-
erate some of the same issues as best-seller books. Everyone wants it now, not next 
month after all the talk has faded. In terms of circulation, feature-film videos beat 
nonfiction videos hands down; theatrical films represent roughly 68 percent of the col-
lections, 72 percent of the expenditures, and 80 percent of the circulations. 14  Unfortu-
nately, as of the 2010, there was no DVD equivalent of the McNaughton book-rental 
plan where a library may lease multiple copies of a popular title for a short time and re-
turn all or some of the copies after the demand has died down. Some libraries attempt 
to establish a ratio of copies to requests (holds). The problem with purchased multiple </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Current Media Formats 205
</p>
<p>copies, print or not, is that they occupy valuable storage space after the demand has 
died off, and scarce money has been expended on the same content. However, not hav-
ing the material available when the demand is high can have negative consequences in 
the form of unhappy users. 
</p>
<p> Perhaps a solution is on the horizon: downloadable video. Downloadable e-video 
was being tested by some larger public libraries as of 2007. They use services such 
as OverDrive (audio books, movies, and concert videos, http://www.overdrive.com/re
sources/mediaformats/    ). The Denver Public Library reported that they had more than 
1,200 downloads of their &bdquo;e-Flicks&permil; though they had only 82 titles available. 15  Content 
available for downloading was limited in 2010, but will probably increase rapidly as the 
demand grows. One appealing aspect of the service is that people can download the 
movies from their homes. Yes, titles are limited, and most of what is available are in-
dies (independent productions) or special interest, but the major studios are not likely 
to miss an opportunity to increase revenue and from controlled sites. 
</p>
<p> Cost containment is an issue for most of the libraries offering this type of service. 
Vendors charge the library a fee based on the community&Ecirc;s population. Another concern 
may be monitoring who is doing the downloading; to address this, some libraries have 
restricted e-movie files to residents of the service area only. Finally there are often fees 
to collect from users of the service&middot;in late 2007 they ranged from $2.99 to $49.00 for 
libraries that do charge a fee. 16  Sometimes, as we will discuss in the next chapter, getting 
user fees into the library&Ecirc;s budget can be a challenge, much less getting them into the 
acquisitions department budget. 
</p>
<p> The Arizona Universities Library Consortium (AULC) started an on-demand ser-
vice for accessing streaming video that may prove to be a workable model for groups 
of educational libraries. 17  In 2008, the group partnered with Film for the Humanities 
and Sciences Films Media Group to allow students and faculty members access to all 
6,300 educational videos available from the company. The service, Films On Demand, 
is available at http://ffh.films.com/digitallanding.aspx. The University of Arizona, Ari-
zona State University, and Northern Arizona University libraries provide on- and off-
campus students with access to the films; when any title has been accessed three times 
AULC purchases the perpetual streaming rights for that title. The AULC is also allowed 
to host the file on an AULC server. 
</p>
<p> One of the educational usage issues with video is that an instructor often only 
wants to use a segment from several videos in a class session. While it is possible to have 
several video players available, having all the equipment present and having all the 
videos properly queued is a nuisance and a distraction. With streaming video it is pos-
sible to select the desired segments and put them together in the desired sequence. An 
example might be demonstrating how different actors or directors interpret a scene for 
a Shakespeare play. With video streaming it is possible to 
</p>
<p> &bull; select segments for an entire class or an individual student, 
 &bull; select segments for student or teacher presentations, 
 &bull; bookmark segments for future use, 
 &bull; control the video the same as on a player (play, pause, rewind, and fast 
</p>
<p>forward), and 
 &bull; use selected elements in student assignments. 18  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>206 11&mdash;Media
</p>
<p> Video streaming is reaching all levels of education from kindergarten to Harvard&Ecirc;s 
Business School. School media centers and academic libraries can use programs such 
as Windows Media Player, RealTime, or Quicktime to deliver the material to the class-
room. The difference between streaming and downloading is that with streaming one has 
the ability to immediately view images as they arrive rather than waiting for an entire 
download to be completed before viewing anything. (Maximizing teaching time is a 
factor for instructors.) Some educational video content providers offer video-streaming 
services and occasionally material from other producers who are not yet offering such 
service. Generally, the charge for the streaming service is an annual fee based on school 
enrollment. 
</p>
<p> Movie Ratings and Libraries 
</p>
<p> One concern, especially for public libraries, is the potential for complaints about 
or censorship challenges to its video collections. Public libraries usually address movie 
ratings in their collection-development policy statement. School library media centers 
have somewhat less exposure to challenges because of the instructional nature of the 
collections; however, even in these libraries it is possible to have a parent complain 
about a video, such as one dealing with evolution. Very often the complaint will raise the 
question about the suitability of certain titles for young viewers and the need for &bdquo;pro-
tecting the children.&permil; This was the major factor in the creation of the movie rating sys-
tem. Acquisitions department staff members need some understanding of the rating 
systems (for movies and games) as some items may have more than one version. 
</p>
<p> The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has a rating system for its 
releases&middot;the familiar G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17 one sees in the movie section of 
the newspaper. The Classification and Rating Administration (CARA) within MPAA 
establishes each film&Ecirc;s rating. While these ratings have no legal force and, in fact, are 
based on the somewhat subjective opinion of the CARA rating board, the general pub-
lic accepts them as appropriate. The key is the content of each film in terms of its suit-
ability for children. 
</p>
<p> The unfortunate fact is that even a collection of G- and PG-rated titles does not 
ensure that there will be no complaints. One possible way to handle the situation, al-
though it is not always easy to accomplish, is to create two sections for video, one in the 
children&Ecirc;s/young adult area and another in the adult area. Again, this will not forestall 
all complaints, but it could help. 
</p>
<p> The Indianapolis&ndash;Marion County Library developed a video policy after several 
people expressed concerns about &bdquo;potential effect on minors.&permil; 19  The library formed a 
Community Video Task Force to review the existing policy and make recommendations, 
if any, for changes. Their report concluded that the policy should retain the parent&Ecirc;s right 
to restrict a child&Ecirc;s borrowing to the juvenile videos, and that the staff should continue 
to receive training in the current policy. The basic policy is that anyone can borrow any 
video, unless it is a child with a card stamped &bdquo;JV,&permil; which indicates a parental restric-
tion. The person who raised the issue wanted the policy to require the parents to give 
written permission for a child to borrow anything but juvenile titles. You might want to 
check the video polices of some other libraries such as those for the Weyauwega Pub-
lic Library (http://www.wegalibrary.org/VideoPolicy.asp) or the Oscoda County Li-
brary (http://www.oscoda.lib.mi.us/video.html) </p>

</p>
<p> Video and Copyright 
</p>
<p> Videos are an important source of programming for public libraries, although such 
programming can be something of a problem because of performance rights, which are 
a component of the copyright law. For libraries in educational settings, performance 
can be an even more significant issue. 
</p>
<p> Although there are a considerable number of substantive copyright questions re-
lating to print material, copyright issues are even trickier when it comes to nonprint, 
especially in academic and school libraries. A full discussion of copyright is not pos-
sible or appropriate in this book, but some discussion is relevant to this chapter as it is 
important to know what rights are acquired at the time of purchase. (Note: What follows 
 is not legal advice;  it is merely a brief review of the issues and the American Library As-
sociation&Ecirc;s guidelines and position regarding copyright. When in doubt about what is 
or is not legal, get legal counsel.) Copyright holders can, do, and have enforced their 
rights in court. 
</p>
<p> The purpose of copyright is to promote the development and distribution of infor-
mation while ensuring that the individual or group that developed the idea or informa-
tion has exclusive rights to profit from that activity. In addition, society reserves for 
itself the right to use the material developed within limits without violating the copy-
right holder&Ecirc;s right, through its copyright laws. The labels for the concept vary; in the 
United States it is  called  &bdquo;fair use,&permil; in the United Kingdom it is &bdquo;fair rights,&permil; and in Can-
ada it is &bdquo;fair dealing.&permil; The challenge is determining what is fair. 
</p>
<p> Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Law (Public Law 94&ndash;553, Title 17 of the  U.S. 
Code ), while legally establishing the doctrine of fair use, is short and fairly nonspe-
cific. The doctrine relates to copying, reproduction (multiple copies), and actual use. It 
indicates that use for criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and 
research are reasonable and fair purposes. Further, it specifies four criteria to consider 
in determining if the use is fair: 
</p>
<p>  1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a 
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; 
</p>
<p>  2. The nature of the copyrighted work; 
  3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copy-
</p>
<p>righted work as a whole; 
  4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copy-
</p>
<p>righted work. 
</p>
<p> Clearly there is room for interpretation and argument. Guidelines developed by ed-
ucators, publishers, and authors provide some indication of what various parties be-
lieve is reasonable for fair use. The guidelines are not part of the statute, but they were 
part of the House Judiciary Committee&Ecirc;s report on the copyright bill. They are  Guide-
lines for Classroom Copying in Not-for-Profit Educational Institutions  and  Guidelines 
for Educational Uses of Music.  20  It is important to remember that copyright protection 
extends to literary works; dramatic works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pic-
torial, graphic, and sculptural works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; and 
sound recordings (Sec. 102). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>208 11&mdash;Media
</p>
<p> Some of the media discussed in this chapter are specifically covered in several 
sections of the copyright law. Following are a  few  of the items and relevant sections of 
the law. 
</p>
<p> Audiovisual 108 (f) (3) 
 Audiovisual work other than news 107, 108 (h) 
 Book 107, 108 
 Graphic work 107, 108 (h) 
 Importing copies from abroad 602 (a) (3) 
 Instructional transmission 107, 110 
 Motion picture 107, 108 (h) 
 Musical work 107, 108 (h) 
 Periodical article 107, 108 
 Pictorial work 107, 108 (h) 
 Public broadcasting program 107, 108 (d) (3) 
 Sound recording 107, 108, 114. 
</p>
<p> Libraries providing classroom media support face significant copyright ques-
tions. Teachers and professors may want to use a personal tape they made in class us-
ing the school&Ecirc;s equipment. Is that legal? The answer depends on many factors. A key 
issue is, when did the taping occur? Few tapes the teachers want to use are home vid-
eos; most are copies of a broadcast program the teacher made using a personal video 
recorder. Such off-air recordings may be legally used if they are 45 days old or less and 
played in the classroom with a teacher present. The tapes must be erased after 45 days 
to comply with the guidelines. 
</p>
<p> The issue is too complex to explore in this book, but performance rights are part of 
the mechanism by which all the people involved in the production of the video receive 
compensation. The easiest way to think about it is in terms of book royalties: each new 
copy sold means a small payment is due the author. For performance rights each perfor-
mance should mean a small payment is due to each of the participants involved in the 
production of the video or film. To cover such costs the producer or distributor of a 
video may or may not include performance rights in the price. (Essentially performance 
rights pertain when there is a presentation to a number of people at the same time, 
such as a children&Ecirc;s program in the library.) The best approach is to acquire videos with 
performance rights; this will almost always mean a higher price than listed, unless it is 
clearly stated that the price includes performance rights. 
</p>
<p> Other Image Formats 
</p>
<p> As mentioned earlier, many libraries, because of space, maintenance, and low user 
interest, are disposing of their collections of reel film, filmstrips, slides, and flat pictures. 
(We hope they do so with care and don&Ecirc;t discard items of long-term value societal value 
solely because of storage space concerns.) Most filmstrips were designed as instruc-
tional material and required special projectors, but many of the items are now digitized 
and available online. The same is true of many of the slide sets. Flat pictures have al-
ways presented challenges in organization and access. Scanning images is an approach 
to keeping pictorial materials in order and increasing access, especially if available via </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Current Media Formats 209
</p>
<p>the library Web site, assuming there are no outstanding copyright issues. However, it 
does little to improve access, unless you engage in a significant amount of indexing. (It 
is possible to create a Word file of terms and use the &bdquo;Find&permil; capability to create a very 
simple digital search function. The process of scanning is more complicated than plac-
ing the item on a scanner and clicking &bdquo;scan.&permil; One needs to verify that there is a match 
been the scanned and original image. Images also require substantial amounts of disk 
memory and high-end computers (and occasionally printers) to make effective use 
of them. 
</p>
<p> Maps 
</p>
<p> Maps are a form of pictorial material, and most libraries have traditionally held at 
least a small collection, in addition to atlases in the reference collection. Internet map 
sites, such as MapQuest, Google Maps, or Multimap, have significantly reduced the 
demand for road maps in libraries. Information found on such sites provides what most 
people were seeking when they came to the library &bdquo;looking for a map&permil;&middot;street and 
highway information. 
</p>
<p> Maps actually come in a variety of forms and content. Large public libraries, aca-
demic libraries, and many business and industrial libraries have extensive collections. 
Maps take the form of graphic representations of such things as geological structures, 
physical features, economic data, and population distributions. They may be in a variety 
of forms&middot;folded, sheets, raised relief, globes, and even aerial or satellite images. Any 
major map collection must determine its scope and define what to collect. Although 
most collections would incorporate aerial photographs, including satellite photographs, 
should they also house the remote sensing data from satellites? Are raised relief maps 
worth including, or are they a commercial product of no real informational value? Clearly 
the users&Ecirc; requirements will determine the answers to these and many other questions 
about the collection. 
</p>
<p> Depending on the collection&Ecirc;s purpose, maps may be organized in a simple geo-
graphic-location sequence or by some more complex system. When someone asks, 
&bdquo;Do you have a map of X?&permil; it may (and usually does) mean a map showing streets, roads, 
and other cultural features. However, it could also mean a topographic map, which pro-
vides elevation information in addition to cultural features. Or maybe the person want a 
soils map to get information for agricultural or construction purposes. Most map users 
who want a contour map, however, will ask for &bdquo;the topo map of X.&permil; Normally, the per-
son with specialized map needs is knowledgeable about maps and will be precise in her 
request. In a large collection, it is common to keep types of maps together, for exam-
ple, topographic, cultural, political, and geologic maps. In addition to content, factors 
such as projection and scale may be important in the organization and storage of maps. 
Staff working with large map collections will need special training to handle this for-
mat properly. 
</p>
<p> A relatively new service in some larger academic and public libraries is Geo-
graphic Information Services (GIS). Rhonda Houser outlined some of the types of 
user queries a GIS program might assist with: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Identifying a specific geographic data set, 
 &bull; Creating a map or image from a spatial data set, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>210 11&mdash;Media
</p>
<p> &bull; Converting spatial data from two or more formats to a single form, 
 &bull; Cropping spatial data to generate a new map, 
 &bull; Creating data and applying it to a map, 
 &bull; Taking Global Positioning System (GPS) data and creating a map, 
 &bull; Creating a map from tabular data, 
 &bull; Linking an image to a GIS using geographic coordinates, and 
 &bull; Performing spatial data analysis. 21  
</p>
<p> Audio Recordings 
</p>
<p> Returning to a widely held format, audio recordings, again, there is great diversity 
and incompatibility, at least in terms of the legacy collections found in many libraries. 
Sound recordings were among the first nonprint formats collected by libraries. In pub-
lic libraries, the recordings are usually part of the circulating collection. For educational 
libraries the purpose is usually instructional, with limited, if any, use outside the li-
brary. This is the media category that most clearly reflects the long-term influence of a 
changing technology on a library collection. 
</p>
<p> Audiobooks are the most common audio-recording purchase in libraries. The 
widespread use of Internet audio streaming, iPods, and other electronic gear has made 
music recordings low use in most libraries. Many libraries retain their older recordings 
because often the performance has not yet migrated to a digital form. These can take 
the form of 78, 33   rpm phonograph records, cassettes, and CDs. Naturally, each for-
mat requires special playing equipment. Usually someone who is interested in hearing 
such material has some familiarity with the equipment, so assisting them is not a great 
problem. A few libraries are purchasing relatively low-cost equipment and software that 
allows one to convert phonograph records to an MP3 format, though the library must be 
careful to do this in compliance with copyright laws. 
</p>
<p> For public libraries, audiobooks have become almost as important as the video 
collection. Automobile players and portable handheld DVD players have created a sig-
nificant market for audiobooks. Even reading a small paperback on a crowded subway 
or bus can be difficult. Listening to a pocket-sized player with a headset allows the lis-
tener to close out the noise, to some degree, and enjoy a favorite piece of music or lis-
ten to a best seller. The same is true for those commuting in their cars or just out for a 
power walk. Another value of audiobooks is providing those with vision impairments 
additional opportunities to enjoy print material that goes beyond those available through 
the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. 
</p>
<p> Books-on-tape cassettes and CDs as well as digital audiobooks (DABs) are very 
popular. The cassette still has a small niche in the audio collection for commuters whose 
vehicle CD player does not provide dependable playback (road bumps can translate 
into sound bumps, perhaps skipping the key information in a whodunit). Tape decks do 
not suffer from this problem, but fewer and fewer vehicles have them as a standard 
feature. 
</p>
<p> Many libraries are forming collaborative DAB services. Some examples of exist-
ing programs in early 2010 include Illinois Kids Zone (www.ilkidszone.info), Lis-
tenOhio (www.listenohio.org), and the Midwest Collaborative for Library Services 
(http://www.mlcnet.org/cms/sitem.cfm/databases__econtent/digital_books/). Unlike 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Current Media Formats 211
</p>
<p>the digital music field, DAB is much more stable and does not, at least in 2010, face 
the copyright issues of music. In 2010, four major vendors offered DAB products&middot;
Audible (www.audible.com), OverDrive (www.overdrive.com), netlibrary/Recorded 
Books  ( www.oclc.org/audiobooks/purchase/default.htm), and TumbleBookLibrary 
(www.tumblebooks.com). Tom Peters and colleagues provided an overview of the dif-
ferences between the services. 22  There are other smaller services that offer very few ti-
tles, but as they grow they may well become significant market players. 
</p>
<p> Many libraries offer two options for accessing their DAB service&middot;a link from the 
title&Ecirc;s MARC record or a link on the library&Ecirc;s Web site. Almost all impose a loan period 
and limits on the number of titles a person may have at any one time. At the time we pre-
pared this chapter, the major issue was DAB incompatibility with the iPod. 
</p>
<p> There are major advantages to having DABs as part of a library&Ecirc;s audio service 
program. Most notably, DABs 
</p>
<p> &bull; are available 24/7, 
 &bull; are never lost or damaged (at least for the library), 
 &bull; require no processing, 
 &bull; require no shelf space, 
 &bull; never require overdue notices or fines (files automatically delete at the end 
</p>
<p>of the loan period), 
 &bull; provide the visually impaired with another means of access to popular 
</p>
<p>titles, 
 &bull; allow for simple weeding, 
 &bull; allow for easy collaboration, and 
 &bull; offer easily obtainable usage data from the vendors. 
</p>
<p> One of the drawbacks of audiocassettes, whether spoken word or music, is that they 
have a relatively short life span, five to six years, even under optimal usage conditions. 
They are also small objects that have few places upon which a library can attach a se-
curity device, so their loss rate (&bdquo;shrinkage&permil; in retail terms) can be rather high. Nor, for 
that matter, is there much room to apply bar codes or other property markings. Replac-
ing lost items can be costly. From the public&Ecirc;s and the staff&Ecirc;s point of view, the fact that 
an unabridged audiobook can have as many as four to six cassettes means that keeping 
everything sorted in its proper order can be a problem. Certainly the staff must check 
each title that has multiple cassettes each time it is returned. If in fact a person is lis-
tening to the cassettes in the car and there is more than one title, there is a very good 
chance a cassette will end up in the wrong container. No one wants to have the ending 
of a whodunit delayed because the last cassette is for Shakti Gawin&Ecirc;s  Creative Visuali-
zation Meditations . 
</p>
<p> Games 
</p>
<p> Should libraries acquire games? Are they actually Will Manley&Ecirc;s &bdquo;Twinkies&permil;? This 
is not the place to review the pros and cons of gaming and libraries. The reality is that 
public and school libraries have ever-growing collections of games&middot;educational and 
recreational in character. Even academic libraries, including at least one large research </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>212 11&mdash;Media
</p>
<p>library, are beginning to collect games. 23  The year 2008 saw the fourth annual academic 
Games, Learning, and Society conference and the second American Library Associa-
tion&ndash;sponsored Games, Learning, and Libraries symposia. &bdquo;Twinkies&permil; or not, games 
are a growing segment of library collections. 
</p>
<p> Games are among the most complex items to select, acquire, and support of all the 
media formats in a collection. Two of the major reasons for the complexity are the fact 
that there are multiple platforms (each widely owned by users) for playing games 
and that there are often multiple releases for a title. Certainly both issues exist, to some 
extent, for video titles. However, as of 2010 there are at least 10 platforms for game 
playing. Although the platforms compete for market share, the competition has not fo-
cused on whose standards or technology will win; rather, it is whose games attract and 
hold players&Ecirc; attention longest and money spent on products for a given platform. Fol-
lowing are the 10 game platforms available on retail store shelves in 2010: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Nintendo DS 
 &bull; Nintendo Game Cube 
 &bull; Playstation 2 
 &bull; Playstation 3 
 &bull; Game Boy Advanced 
 &bull; PC/MAC based games 
 &bull; Xbox 
 &bull; Xbox 360 
 &bull; PSP 
 &bull; Wii 
</p>
<p> When such a variety of platforms is combined with cross-platform releases of a ti-
tle, one can see where there would be serious acquisitions budget issues and possible 
ordering pitfalls. Acquiring games is more labor intensive than acquiring many of the 
other collection items. Few traditional library vendors handle games, and at the time of 
this writing there was no source for placing a standing order. One method to ease the 
workload is to develop a strong working relationship with a local game store. In the not-
too-distant past, in an almost solely print environment, many public and academic li-
braries established such relationships with a local bookstore. This often helped with 
rush orders and strengthened the bookstore&Ecirc;s income, which in turn expanded the range 
of titles the store stocked. With a strong local bookstore, library selectors had a form of 
approval plan without the amount of work for the acquisitions that arises from tradi-
tional approval plans. 
</p>
<p> Cataloging is another challenge for games as the format is relatively new in collec-
tions. As a result, assuming that games will be represented in the online public access 
catalog (OPAC), a great deal of original cataloging is required for games. 
</p>
<p> Game Ratings 
</p>
<p> Like motion pictures, games have a rating system. Most video games released in 
North America carry a rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), 
a nonprofit, self-regulatory, third-party entity formed in 1994 by what is now the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Current Media Formats 213
</p>
<p>Entertainment Software Association. ESRB ratings consist of two parts: a rating sym-
bol on the front of the box addressing age appropriateness, and one of more than 30 
different content descriptors (e.g., alcohol reference, blood and gore) on the back of 
the box elaborating on elements that may be of interest or concern to users and/or 
their guardians. 24  
</p>
<p> The seven ratings on the box front are EC, early childhood; E, everyone six and up; 
E10, everyone ten and up; T, teen thirteen and up; M, mature seventeen and up; AO, 
adults only eighteen and up; and RP, rating pending. The rating system complexity and 
the need to provide information about system requirements exemplify the types of 
challenges that face acquisitions and cataloging departments in libraries that are col-
lecting games. Games also raise some serious policy issues, in particular how to moni-
tor who uses what rating. 
</p>
<p> Realia 
</p>
<p> Teaching realia, test kits, and models can range from samples of materials, such as 
rocks or insects, to working models and large, take-apart anatomical models. Scientific 
and technical supply houses offer a variety of large-scale models for use in the class-
room. Because the models are expensive, few teachers can afford to buy them, so the 
instructional media center is the usual source for these, except where there is a large 
biology or physics department that acquires the items. Even in the case of large depart-
ments, students get better service if the models are also in the media center where they 
can examine the material any time. 
</p>
<p> With replicas the acquisitions department staff must check for the degree of accu-
racy that is being requested. Fossils and anatomical replicas are available in differing 
levels of detail from very few (a general representation) to highly detailed (useful in ad-
vanced instruction or basic research). Not all replicas come in different levels of detail, 
which further compounds the challenge of acquiring the desired item without commit-
ting undue staff time to the ordering and receiving process. 
</p>
<p> Microforms 
</p>
<p> Paul Negus opened his paper on the future of microfilm by stating, &bdquo;Microfilm use 
has declined significantly over the past ten years as digital technologies have been 
adapted more widely. This seems to be the general feeling and understanding of the mi-
crofilm industry, but what is the reality?&permil; 25  He concluded his essay with, &bdquo;Microfilm is 
not only alive and well but may well turn out to be the missing Digital Preservation 
&Acirc;Holy Grail&Ecirc; that has alluded [sic] the Archive for the last 20 years.&permil; 26  
</p>
<p> Although most libraries currently acquire little in the way of microforms, some 
still do. and a great many more have substantial legacy collections containing informa-
tion that is still sought by users and is not readily available in any other format. Although 
it is possible to digitize microforms, few libraries have the funds to undertake such work. 
Also, few commercial firms find it a profitable activity because of low demand. One of 
the major factors behind the microformat was its ability to store large volumes of low 
use information in very little space. The bulk of the material contained in a microfor-
mat is either backfiles of serials or rare or ephemeral information. One reason libraries </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>214 11&mdash;Media
</p>
<p>acquired microforms was that they save collection storage space, especially for low-
use materials. Thirty years of back issues of a journal, occupying 25 feet of shelving, 
can be reduced to three reels of microfilm, which, in their cardboard storage boxes, 
require less than one foot of space. 
</p>
<p> Microforms may also provide access to primary research material or to items that 
are very rare and may only be available, in their original form, in one or two libraries in 
the world. Thus, while many librarians and most of the public view microforms with 
some degree&middot;or a great deal&middot;of displeasure, they have served a useful function in pro-
viding access to materials that might not otherwise be available locally. 
</p>
<p> Microforms are still in use and are still being acquired by libraries, especially large 
academic libraries. ProQuest-UMI Microfilm is one of the largest vendors of micro-
form in the marketplace. One example of the products that are available is their Amer-
ican History and Culture set of 8,000 microfiche, which is described as follows: 
&bdquo;Since 1930 the National Park Service has sponsored or acquired thousands of archae-
ological, architectural, ethnographic, museum collections management and historical 
research reports exploring the riches of the American heritage. Few have been available 
even at the largest libraries and research institutions.&permil; 27  From a technical services point 
of view, the bad news is the fiche set does not have MARC records available for in put-
ting into the library&Ecirc;s OPAC. In a very real sense, thousands of fiche in cabinets with-
out an effective means of accessing individual titles within the set may be a marginal 
acquisition at best or the catalog department is faced with a very large, probably original, 
cataloging project. 
</p>
<p> The two most common microform formats in libraries are reel film and fiche. Reel 
formats are the older of the two and were widely used for newspapers and serials. Reel 
microfilms are long strips of film on the appropriate-size reel and have traditionally been 
available in several sizes: 16mm, 35mm, and 70mm. The film can be positive (i.e., clear 
with black text) or negative (i.e., dark with white text). Acquisition staff members need 
to know about these different types because different microfilm readers have different 
capabilities&middot;the greater the machine&Ecirc;s flexibility in handling film size, negative or pos-
itive images, and reduction ratios the higher the cost. Few libraries are able to purchase 
the top-of-the-line reader/printers and therefore select more affordable but more limited 
models. That in turn means the acquisitions department must know what type of mi-
croform to order. Most libraries try to confine the microfilm collection to one or two 
sizes (such as 35mm and 70mm) and one type (positive or negative). With any large-
scale collection, however, more variety is inevitable, because the information needed by 
the library may only be available in a particular size and type of microfilm. 
</p>
<p> Microfiche are sheets of film with the images of the original document arranged 
in columns and rows. Fiche are primarily employed for materials that might have a 
number of simultaneous users of the collection/title, such as college catalogs or tele-
phone directories. Like other media, microfiche came in a variety of sizes and reduction 
ratios. Common sizes are 3 by 5 inches, 3 by 6 inches, and 6 by 7 inches, and reduction 
ratios range from 12 to more than 200. The greater the reduction ratio the more infor-
mation the producer can fit on a single fiche. Many commercial publications are 48x 
(the &bdquo;x&permil; equals the reduction ratio), but the other relatively common ratio is 16x. 
</p>
<p> Although microforms are becoming more and more a legacy collection format, 
acquisitions and cataloging staff must have some knowledge of the variations in the 
format that makes their work just a little more challenging. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Preservation 215
</p>
<p> PRESERVATION 
</p>
<p> Throughout the preceding sections we mentioned variations in size and shape of 
the media formats. This variety has implications for storage, access, and long-term pre-
servation. Although it is possible to use standard library bookcases to house these ma-
terials, even with adjustable shelves such storage wastes space. Library equipment and 
supply houses offer a wide range of cabinets and storage units designed for the different 
formats and, in more expensive models, to help create better environmental conditions 
for preservation purposes. Two media formats, microforms and videos/films, have spe-
cial storage considerations we will touch on briefly. 
</p>
<p> DVDs present two different and significant challenges for libraries&middot;damage and 
security. Damage to DVDs is very high. In responding to Oder&Ecirc;s survey, one librarian 
said &bdquo;[DVDs] are used for coasters and Frisbees.&permil; 28  One obvious factor in the damage 
is that, unlike a cassette, the operating surface is fully exposed during handling the disk. 
Scratches, chips, and even warping are problems. Thus, the expected circulation life of 
a popular DVD is low. Many libraries think they are lucky if they get 15 to 20 circula-
tions. Replacement cost can become significant. A few libraries have taken the step of 
buying one noncirculating copy of titles deemed significant for the library and plac-
ing it in their special collection or archive as a means of preservation. 
</p>
<p> Because of their small size, theft is a much greater problem for DVDs than for VHS 
cassettes. Determining how to display available titles is also a challenge. Some librar-
ies put out empty cases. Others have tried using locked display cases similar to those 
used in commercial outlets. A few display color copies of the cases in their OPAC or 
on a bulletin board, keeping the disk at a service desk. Oder reported that one library 
had experienced losses in excess of $90,000 in less than five years of offering DVDs. 29  
Until someone comes up with an effective solution, library staff, both in technical and 
public services will spend a significant amount of time dealing with DVD preservation 
and security matters. 
</p>
<p> Microforms 
</p>
<p> Microfiche may or may not be stored inside a protective cover, such as an enve-
lope or a notebook. Unnecessary handling increases the chances of damaging the fiche. 
Microforms, like many of the other media formats discussed in this chapter, are physi-
cally made up of a series of layers. That is, there is a relatively thick, strong carrier base, 
often acetate or polyacetate, with a very thin surface layer that contains the image. The 
surface layer is very susceptible to damage. The two common types of fiche are diazo 
and silver halide. Silver halide is archival quality, but very easy to scratch. Diazo, al-
though not considered a permanent film, is harder to damage, but it is still susceptible 
to scratching. Most damage occurs during the filing and refiling process. Damage to a 
corner of the fiche can put a scratch down the entire surface of the fiche behind it. De-
pending on the film&Ecirc;s reduction ratio, the amount of information lost may be little or 
great (the higher the ratio, the more data will disappear). 
</p>
<p> Film and Video 
</p>
<p> Standard library shelving can house films and videos and make them more avail-
able for browsing, but it wastes space. Library equipment vendors sell storage cabinets </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>216 11&mdash;Media
</p>
<p>designed to store various types and sizes of media material. The depth, length, and 
width of video cabinet drawers are such that three or four rows of cassettes will fit into 
a drawer. A storage problem arises, however, with a mixed collection of VHS, Beta, 
three-quarter-inch cassettes and DVDs. 
</p>
<p> In terms of care of these materials, someone should rewind and inspect each video-
cassette and film (if film is still in the collection) at least once every six months, even 
if it is unused. In an environment where there is high temperature (over 80 degrees 
Fahrenheit) and humidity (65 percent and higher), the thin image-bearing layer (emul-
sion layer) becomes soft and somewhat sticky. Films and videos left in such conditions 
for long periods, without use, become so sticky that the image-bearing layer pulls off 
when use finally occurs. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> One given of media collections is that they will change at almost the same speed as 
technology in general. Keeping updated with development is a challenge, especially for 
staff who have more than enough work to occupy their attention. It seems rather likely 
that media services will play an ever-growing role in the overall service program of most 
libraries.

<p>12  Fiscal Management 
</p>
<p> There seems to be little doubt that more and more library administrators are be-
ginning to hear officials raising questions such as, &bdquo;What are the benefits the 
campus receives for its investments in the library?&permil; 
</p>

<p> It is impossible for many libraries to fulfill all their patrons&Ecirc; needs and wants. 
So they&Ecirc;ll have to be prudent, keep watch on local priorities, and remind fund-
ers of the library&Ecirc;s value as they navigate a challenging future. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Norman Oder, 2010 
</p>
<p> Accountability is a term one hears in reference to almost all types of libraries. All 
organizations, profit or nonprofit, are under increasing pressure to demonstrate their 
value, show that they employed their resources effectively, and prove that they are re-
sponsive to the needs and wants of their stakeholders. Although the chapter epigraph 
from Richard Dougherty relates to academic libraries, the basic message&middot;what value 
do we get from funding your library operations&middot;is very common in today&Ecirc;s tight eco-
nomic times. 
</p>
<p> Fiscal accountability is one of the most significant accountability concerns on the 
part of those who fund an organization and those who use its services. Libraries are 
no exception to this fact of organizational life. If anything, the recent recession has 
magnified the importance of proper fiscal management practices for libraries both for </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>220 12&mdash;Fiscal Management
</p>
<p>accountability reasons and to ensure that available funds are used in the best possible 
manner, as the epigraph from Norman Oder suggests. 
</p>
<p> The management concept of return on investment (ROI) relates to the question of 
value for any type of organization. Libraries have employed the concept from time to 
time; however, few have used it on a consistent, ongoing basis for budget-request pur-
poses. Larry White made the case for a wider regular use of the concept: 
</p>
<p> ROI as an assessment or valuation tool is a valuable asset for the library to pos-
sess in addressing customer accountability inquiries. Applying ROI in poten-
tially new applications within the library organization would provide library 
administrators with a wider scope and effectiveness to report their organiza-
tion&Ecirc;s activities in terms of performance/value/impact and a strategic compe-
titive advantage in the knowledge economy. 1  
</p>
<p> Given that a library&Ecirc;s materials budget is usually the second-largest component of its 
budget, acquisitions departments are clearly in the forefront of any effort to demon-
strate value and what the funding authorities&Ecirc; ROI may be. 
</p>
<p> ROI is essentially a ratio of gains and losses resulting from the resources ex-
pended to achieve the gain or loss. A positive ROI represents more value gained than re-
sources expended, something that almost every organization hopes to achieve. The unit 
typically used to measure ROI is money, although other units can and have been tried 
with rather mixed results. One of the challenges for libraries using ROI is the fact that 
much of a library&Ecirc;s outcomes are more or less intangible, thus making the assignment 
of dollar and cents difficult and open to wide interpretation. What is the value or worth 
of a very satisfied reader who has enjoyed dozens of novels over the past 12 months? 
What is the value or worth gained by a young student who received excellent assistance 
with a class assignment from the library staff? Whether or not it is difficult to do, li-
braries must begin to be more proactive in making use of techniques such as ROI to 
demonstrate their value to society. 
</p>
<p> Libraries never seem to have enough money to do everything they would like to or 
should accomplish. Acquisitions departments play an essential role in the effective use 
of the funds that are available. Library fiscal management is a joint activity involving 
everyone who participates in the process: selectors, acquisitions staff, and senior man-
agement. Controlling expenditures and securing adequate funding are two key activi-
ties. Monies spent on materials for the collection constitute the second-largest expense 
category for most libraries and information centers. Traditionally, in U.S. and Cana-
dian libraries, salaries represent the largest percentage of the total budget, followed by 
the materials (&bdquo;book&permil;) budget, and finally, all other operating expenses. That sequence 
still holds today, but the percentage spent on materials has decreased as salaries have 
risen and the overall budget has increased slowly, if at all. Although percentages vary, 
the order remains the same in any type of library environment or any size collection. 
Most of the literature on the topic of collection budgeting reflects a large research li-
brary orientation. However, the same issues exist in other libraries. 
</p>
<p> For some time now there has been a constant pressure on the materials budget of 
most libraries, which has resulted in a decline in the percentage of the total budget spent 
on acquiring items for the collection. The almost yearly double-digit inflation of serials 
prices has further skewed the traditional balance in collection fund allocations. In many </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Problems in Fiscal Management 221
</p>
<p>libraries in the United States, serials expenditures exceed monographic purchases, even 
in institutions that have traditionally emphasized book collections. Over the past 15-plus 
years, budgetary needs for electronic resources have increased dramatically. In some 
libraries such expenditures predominate, exceeding the combined acquisitions costs of 
all other collection formats. As we will discuss in the section on fund allocation, the 
challenges grow for libraries when they attempt to balance competing, yet equally va-
lid, collection format needs. 
</p>
<p> Comparing the total dollar amount expended on materials 30 years ago with the 
current funding levels, today&Ecirc;s total is considerably higher; but the total expenditures 
do not tell the entire story. Looking at the number of items acquired for the money spent 
reveals that the increase in titles acquired is not proportional to funding increases. Li-
braries are spending more and acquiring less. Since the 1970s, many libraries, along with 
many other organizations, have dealt with budgets that some call &bdquo;steady state,&permil; others 
call &bdquo;zero growth,&permil; and still others call &bdquo;static.&permil; At best, budgeting of this type uses the 
previous year&Ecirc;s inflation rate as the base for the next fiscal year&Ecirc;s increase. An aver-
age inflation rate, like all averages, contains elements that increase at both above and 
below the average rate. For libraries this is a problem, because the inflation rate for in-
formation materials has been running well ahead of the overall inflation rate. 
</p>
<p> PROBLEMS IN FISCAL MANAGEMENT 
</p>
<p> Over the years, collection development staffs in the United States and Canada have 
faced several problems. Book and journal prices have generally increased, and continue 
to increase, at rates well above the average inflation rate as measured by the Consumer 
Price Index (CPI). During this same time, serials prices increased even more rapidly than 
did monograph prices. To maintain serial subscriptions, libraries took monies from 
book funds, thus further reducing the number of monographs acquired. Eventually, li-
braries started canceling subscriptions. Thus, differential inflation rates and the use of 
national average rates as the basis for calculating budgets have contributed to declining 
acquisition rates for many libraries. As noted in the chapter on serials, the change to 
digital has not and probably will not solve the greater than CPI price increases for li-
brary materials. 
</p>
<p> A second problem was, and still is, that the materials budget is vulnerable in peri-
ods of tight budgets. Expenditures on materials are discretionary in that (in theory) a 
library could wait to buy an item until the next fiscal year. Institutions set staff salaries 
on an annual basis, and staff reductions are rare during the middle of a fiscal year, un-
less the organization faces a major financial crisis. Salaries are usually the last item or-
ganizations cut when attempting to save money. Without heat, light, and water (utility 
bills), the physical facility cannot remain open, so those expenditures are generally not 
cut. Some operating expenses are discretionary: pens, pencils, paper, printer cartridges, 
and so forth (i.e., office supplies). Professional development and travel reimbursements 
may be frozen in an attempt to save funds. Institutions may achieve small savings, in 
terms of percentage of the total budget, by cutting back in such areas. Institutions with 
relatively large library collections view the materials budget as one of the largest avail-
able pools of funds that can easily be cut in an emergency. Further, the reality is that 
the monograph materials budget is the only place where significant cuts are easy to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>222 12&mdash;Fiscal Management
</p>
<p>make because the material is not purchased on an ongoing basis. All too often, the 
long-term impact of such decisions does not receive enough consideration, and the other 
choices appear, at least in the short run, to be even less acceptable. These issues are in-
stitutional and apply to corporate and special libraries as much as to publicly funded 
libraries. 
</p>
<p> Norman Oder &rsquo; s article, quoted in one of the chapter epigraphs, reported on  Library 
Journal&Ecirc; s annual survey of public library budgets. Results of the survey, not surprisingly, 
showed a downward trend &mdash; with a 2.6 percent reduction in the overall average budget, 
a 3.5 percent decrease for the materials budget, and, for the first time in several years, a 
1.6 percent decline in the per capita expenditure. 2  The percentage decreases on overall 
and collections funding, while not dramatic, have been on a downward slope for some 
time now. The cumulative impact of year after year reductions is beginning to show in 
ways service communities are noticing. 
</p>
<p> One of the survey questions reported in Oder&Ecirc;s article asked about what coping 
strategies the libraries had implemented for addressing the shortfalls. Following were 
the top six responses: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Cutting travel and training funds&middot;51 percent 
 &bull; Freezing salaries&middot;41 percent 
 &bull; Seeking more outside funding (grants, donations)&middot;36 percent 
 &bull; Cutting or reducing programming activities&middot;28 percent 
 &bull; Reducing service hours&middot;26 percent 
 &bull; Increasing use of volunteers&middot;26 percent 3  
</p>
<p> When asked about which cuts or reductions users would probably miss the most, the 
vast majority of libraries expected service-hour changes to be the most common con-
cern (74%), followed by fewer new titles added (14%), and then reductions in services 
(12%). 4  Making do with less has become a fact of life for most Canadian and U.S. li-
braries, and it seems likely to continue to be the case, at least in the short-term. Thus, 
understanding the issues of financial control and making the most effective use of the 
available funds is critical. With collection funds usually being the second-largest com-
ponent in a library&Ecirc;s budget, acquisitions staff must commit themselves to handling the 
funds properly and thoughtfully. 
</p>
<p> LIBRARY FUND ACCOUNTING 
</p>
<p> Most libraries and information centers are part of not-for-profit (NFP) organiza-
tions. Being NFP affects how the library maintains its financial records, particularly in 
contrast to for-profit organizations. For libraries that are part of a government jurisdic-
tion, most revenues are received through an annual budget. The funding authorities re-
view the budget requests and authorize certain levels of funding for various activities. 
The three most common forms of income for libraries are appropriations (monies dis-
tributed by the governing body to its agencies to carry out specific purposes), revenue 
generated by the library as a result of service fees and fines, and endowments and do-
nations. 
</p>
<p> Because of the nature of the financial activities, certain accounting terms and con-
cepts are different for NFP organizations than for for-profit organizations. However, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Accounting 223
</p>
<p>some general accounting rules and practices do apply. One special term for NFP 
accounting is  fund accounting.  (Fund accounting has been defined as a set of self-
balancing account groups.) Another difference is that whereas the profit-oriented book-
keeping system equation uses the terms  assets, liabilities,  and  equity,  NFP accounting 
uses assets, liabilities, and  fund balance.  One of the equations for NFP bookkeeping is 
that assets must equal liabilities plus the fund balance; another is that the fund balance 
is   the difference between assets and liabilities. Substituting &bdquo;equity&permil; for &bdquo;fund balance&permil; 
would make the equation apply to for-profit organizations. (A difference between these 
equations is that an increase in fund balance carries no special meaning, whereas an in-
crease in equity is a positive signal in a for-profit organization.) Other terms, such as  debit, 
credit, journalizing, posting,  and  trial balance,  have the same meaning regardless of the 
organization&Ecirc;s profit orientation. Balance sheets are discussed in greater detail later in 
this chapter. 
</p>
<p> Accounting is the process of identifying, measuring, and communicating economic 
information to permit informed judgments and decisions by users of the information. 
Several groups or individuals in the library use accounting information (the term  ac-
counting  includes bookkeeping activities). Selectors need to know how much money 
they have to spend. The head librarian needs data to maintain control over the library&Ecirc;s 
operation. The business office must have information to ensure that the library handles 
its funds properly. It is the acquisitions department that provides this information, at 
least about that portion of the library&Ecirc;s budget used for building the collections. Usu-
ally there is a support staff member who handles the accounting activities. This person 
needs to have training and experience in accounting and bookkeeping. Anyone interested 
in a career as a support staff member in acquisitions might consider taking coursework in 
accounting, because such work expands employment opportunities (in seeking both a 
position and promotions). 
</p>
<p> The bookkeeping unit usually handles all of a library&Ecirc;s accounting work (payroll 
records, accounts payable/receivable, purchasing, inventory control, and some cost ac-
counting). Frequently, this unit is part of the acquisitions department. When this is not 
the case, that unit must work very closely with the acquisitions department because a 
large percentage of the accounting work involves both units. Consequently, everyone 
in acquisitions must have some basic understanding of accounting and bookkeeping, 
even those not directly involved in those activities. 
</p>
<p> Although library bookkeeping requires some variations from standard practice, it 
is important for the library staff handling the internal books to understand standard ac-
counting procedures. The library bookkeeper, for example, must reconcile library re-
cords with those of the business office. Because the results concern many people, it is 
important to understand the business office&Ecirc;s records and what they represent. 
</p>
<p> ACCOUNTING 
</p>
<p> The term accounting   covers several activities that many people view as separate 
fields: 
</p>
<p>  1.  General accounting  deals with the process of recording fiscal data (this 
includes bookkeeping). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>224 12&mdash;Fiscal Management
</p>
<p>  2.  Cost accounting  determines business costs (most frequently, unit costs). 
  3.  Tax accounting  determines liability for taxes, especially income and So-
</p>
<p>cial Security taxes. 
  4.  Auditing  is the process of verifying the accuracy of financial records. 
  5.  Budgetary accounting  is the preparation of systematic forecasts of oper-
</p>
<p>ations in fiscal terms. 
  6.  System building  is the development and installation of the appropriate fi-
</p>
<p>nancial records in an organization. 
  7.  Governmental accounting  deals with maintaining financial records for 
</p>
<p>governmental units. 
</p>
<p> Library accounting takes in the first four fields and the last; the fifth and sixth fields 
seldom apply to library situations. 
</p>
<p> Balance Sheet 
</p>
<p> One important element in accounting and bookkeeping is the balance sheet, which 
indicates the institution&Ecirc;s financial condition at any given time. Although the library may 
not always have a balance sheet, its parent or funding body will have one, and the li-
brary&Ecirc;s expenditures must fit into that larger fiscal picture. Thus, having some basic 
knowledge of the balance sheet helps the staff understand some of the requirements of 
the funding authorities. The funding authorities are also usually accountable to other 
agencies that frequently require financial audits. There is more about audits later in 
this chapter. 
</p>
<p> A balance sheet shows the amounts and nature of assets, liabilities, and proprietor-
ship of an organization. The balance sheet is the statement of the basic equation of 
accounting: assets = liabilities + proprietorship. Assets are anything of value owned; 
liabilities are obligations to pay (money or other assets) or to render service to persons 
or organizations now or in the future; proprietorship is the difference between assets and 
liabilities. A library has proprietorship only when it derives a portion of its funds from 
endowments. (Normally there is an annual distribution of endowment income. Other-
wise, the term &bdquo;fund balance&permil; may be substituted for &bdquo;proprietorship.&permil;) 
</p>
<p> No uniform format exists for the balance sheet. However, two very common me-
thods of presenting a statement of financial condition are the account form (horizontal 
form) and the report form (vertical form). Account forms list assets on the left-hand side 
of a page and liabilities and proprietorship on the right-hand side. The final totals of 
the columns are equal. The report form lists all assets, then all liabilities, and finally 
the proprietorship. A great many variations exist on these basic forms, but the important 
point to remember is that the assets must equal the liabilities and fund balance/pro-
prietorship. 
</p>
<p> Accounts and Ledgers 
</p>
<p> Every business transaction has dual elements (a part of the dual-entry system de-
scribed later). Every financial entry in the journals and ledgers in the acquisitions de-
partment is a business transaction of some type. The dual elements arise because each 
transaction is an exchange of values: Something of value is given up for something else, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Accounting 225
</p>
<p>presumably of equal value. The bookkeeper must record both elements. As these factors 
change, they change the value of the assets, liabilities, and fund balance. Thus, it is im-
portant to have a recording system that will show the changes with a minimum of space, 
effort, and error. 
</p>
<p> Most ILS systems provide a short, accurate method for recording transactions, sep-
arating the increases from the decreases for each amount. This means balancing assets 
against liabilities and fund balance. An account records the effects of a transaction. An 
acquisitions department uses as many accounts as necessary to provide adequate de-
tailed information. Usually, there is one account for each fund in the department, and 
once a month the bookkeeper assembles the data in these accounts into a balance sheet. 
The conventional method of handling accounts places additions to assets on the left side 
of the account and additions to liabilities and fund balance on the right. 
</p>
<p> Two terms used in recording changes in value are  debit  (Dr.) and  credit  (Cr.). Debit 
refers to the left side of an account (assets). Credit refers to the right side (liabilities). Thus, 
a debit is an entry on the left, and a credit is an entry on the right. The idea of debits tied 
to assets and credits to liabilities can be very confusing to beginners and to anyone not ac-
quainted with accounting terminology. Perhaps the best way to keep the relationships 
in mind and to remember how the terms affect the balance is to use a chart like the 
following: 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;Debit&rdquo; Indicates That &ldquo;Credit&rdquo; Indicates That 
</p>
<p> Assets increase Assets decrease 
 Liabilities decrease Liabilities increase 
 Fund balance decreases Fund balance increases 
 Income decreases Income increases 
 Expenses increase Expenses decrease 
</p>
<p> A basic rule of accounting is that for every debit there must be a credit. This does 
not mean that the number of debit and credit entries must be equal, but rather that the 
debit and credit amounts must be equal. 
</p>
<p> The name for a group of accounts is the  ledger.  This is a derived record presenting 
in an analytical form the total effect of all transactions. Data are taken from the books 
in which the bookkeeper made the original entries (called journals, discussed shortly). 
Normally, there is only one account on a page of the ledger. In the past, a loose-leaf led-
ger was very common because it was flexible. Automated systems have made the paper-
based ledger a thing of the past, although some acquisitions departments maintain a 
paper-based shadow system in case the computer system goes down. Accounts can be 
arranged and rearranged in whatever order works for the department. 
</p>
<p> Once a month, the bookkeeper prepares a  trial balance.  This is a listing of ledger 
accounts showing debit and credit balances. The object is to determine whether the 
debits and credits are equal, or in balance. A trial balance serves several purposes: 
</p>
<p>  1. It provides a partial check on the accuracy of bookkeeping by proving the 
equality of total debits and credits. 
</p>
<p>  2. It provides a way to more quickly detect errors and their sources. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>226 12&mdash;Fiscal Management
</p>
<p>  3. It provides a condensed picture of each account and a summary of all ac-
counts. 
</p>
<p>  4. It is often the basis for preparing financial statements. 
</p>
<p> Trial balancing uses three columns. One column is for the account total, and the other 
two are for the account debits and credits. Bookkeepers use two techniques to show the 
amounts for each account on the trial balance. One technique is to list only the balance 
of each account; this approach reduces the initial amount of work. The other method is 
to list the amounts in the debit and credit columns for each account, which provides more 
detailed information. 
</p>
<p> The trial balance is an essential accounting tool, but it does not reveal some kinds 
of errors. It indicates whether debits and credits are equal, but not whether compensat-
ing errors have occurred on both sides of the account. An item may be properly posted&middot;
that is, the right amounts are on the debit and credit sides&middot;but to the wrong account. A 
trial balance does not reveal a mistake in classifying information in the journal. Of 
course, an unrecorded ledger transaction will also go undetected during a trial bal-
ance. Therefore, even if the trial balance appears to be correct, there may be a number 
of errors in the system. This is one of the reasons that it is necessary to have the books 
audited. 
</p>
<p> Journal 
</p>
<p> As just indicated, the ledger is not a complete record of transactions. For a number 
of reasons, it is desirable to have a preliminary record in which one records transactions 
in chronological order with an explanation of the nature of each entry. In an acquisi-
tions department, sequential order numbers constitute, in part, such a primary record. 
The order file used to be a part of what accountants called the &bdquo;daybook,&permil; an informal 
record of the day&Ecirc;s activity. Most organizations do not use a daybook any more but make 
entries directly into the electronic  journal.  The journal is the book of original entry, with 
transactions recorded in chronological order. Entries to the journal come from what-
ever records now substitute for the daybook (e.g., invoices, orders, sales slips, cash-
register tapes). A journal may be more than just a book or electronic file with account 
numbers, debits, credits, and a brief explanation about the transaction. Often associated 
with it are files of documents or other media (backup material explaining the transac-
tion). Following are the important features of the journal: 
</p>
<p>  1. It is a day-to-day record of each transaction. 
  2. It is the point at which the debit and credit aspects of all transactions can be 
</p>
<p>analyzed. This very important activity can cause a great many problems 
if done improperly. 
</p>
<p>  3. It is the point at which a transaction becomes a series of numbers. The ex-
planation of the transaction may not be extensive. However, it must be ad-
equate to direct someone from the journal entry to the proper backup file 
to find a full explanation. 
</p>
<p> The term used to indicate recording entries in a journal is  journalizing.  Most li-
braries (if not all) now use one of several computer-based spreadsheet programs to han-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Estimating Costs 227
</p>
<p>dle this task. Journals and ledgers are the basic items in what accountants call the  double-
entry  accounting system. Double-entry simply means recording each transaction in both 
the journal and the ledger. The journal is the original chronological record; the ledger is 
a secondary analytical record. Perhaps the most important difference between the jour-
nal and the ledger is that because the journal contains the first entries, it usually carries 
greater weight as legal evidence. 
</p>
<p> In most libraries, the major fund is the operating fund. Other funds may be endow-
ment and physical plant funds. The operating funds are the group of accounts used to 
handle the day-to-day activities of the library for a given time, usually 12 months, and 
covering such items as salaries, materials purchases, and utility bills. Within the oper-
ating fund there may be two categories of accounts: restricted and unrestricted. 
</p>
<p>  Restricted accounts  require using the monies only for specific purposes. Collection 
development and acquisition staffs often work with such accounts (frequently referred 
to as  funds  in the monetary rather than the accounting meaning of the term). More of-
ten than not, these accounts are the result of donations by individuals who have expressed 
definite ideas about how the library may spend the money. 
</p>
<p> Some libraries have endowments that are a combination of individual and corpo-
rate or foundation gifts. Sometimes gifts are for current use, and sometimes they are for 
an endowment. Endowments should generate income for the library indefinitely. The 
normal procedure for endowments is to make available some percentage of the interest 
earned. The balance of the interest is returned to the endowment to increase its capi-
talized base. Private libraries, and an increasing number of publicly funded libraries, 
have one or more endowments. Often, the donor&Ecirc;s restrictions are narrow. When the re-
strictions are too narrow, it is difficult to make effective use of the available monies. 
Most collection development officers prefer  unrestricted  accounts (used for any appro-
priate item for the collection) or broad-based restricted accounts. 
</p>
<p> The purpose of the accounting system is to ensure the proper use of monies pro-
vided and to make it possible to track expenditures. That is, one must record (charge) 
every financial transaction to some account, and a record exists of what the transaction 
involved. With a properly functioning fund accounting system, it is possible to tie ev-
ery item acquired to a specific account and to verify when the transaction took place. 
With a good accounting system, one can easily provide accurate reports about all finan-
cial aspects of collection development activities. Furthermore, it is a great planning aid. 
It takes time to understand accounting systems, but librarians must understand them if 
they wish to be effective and efficient collection development officers. 
</p>
<p> A good book to consult for accounting information is G. Stevenson Smith&Ecirc;s  Man-
agerial Accounting for Libraries and Other Not-for-Profit Organizations,  2nd edi-
tion. Another good resource is Anne M. Turner&Ecirc;s  Managing Money: A Guide for 
Librarians.  5

<p> ESTIMATING COSTS 
</p>
<p> Several factors influence the funding needs for collection development and thus 
the amount of money the acquisitions department must handle. Changes in the compo-
sition of the service community may have an important impact in either a positive or a 
negative manner. Another factor is changes in collecting activities, such as the scope </p>

</p>
<p>or depth desired in a subject area. These factors do not arise very often. The two cost 
factors that do come up year in and year out are the price of materials and inflation. 
</p>
<p> From time to time, libraries encounter problems establishing the credibility of 
collection-building funding requirements. Although a good accounting system will as-
sist in justifying budget requests, additional data about material expenditures are of-
ten necessary. 
</p>
<p> One example of the problems caused by inflation, stable budgets, and rapidly rising 
prices for materials (and perhaps limited credibility) is what has happened to the ex-
penditures and acquisition rates for U.S. academic libraries. Between 1993 and 1998, 
monograph prices rose just over 25 percent. For serials, the data were almost shocking: 
between 1986 and 1996, prices rose 169 percent. Although the total amount of money 
expended was higher in 1998 than in 1993, the number of monographs purchased fell 
by 14 percent. 6  
</p>
<p> Data about price increases have been available for some time. In the 1970s, U.S. li-
brarians made an all-out effort to create useful library price indexes to measure rates of 
change. A subcommittee of the American National Standards Institute, the Z39 Com-
mittee (1974), was able to develop guidelines for price indexes. By the early 1980s, it 
was necessary to revise the guidelines, which were later published as Z39.20. 7  Another 
group effort was that of the Library Materials Price Index Committee (formed by the 
Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services, a division of the American 
Library Association [ALA]). The committee has produced a price index for U.S. mate-
rials and some international publications (available at the ALA&Ecirc;s Web site, http://www.
ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/alcts/resources/collect/serials/spi.cfm). These efforts provide 
consistent data on price changes over a long period, which, when averaged, is as close 
as anyone can come to predicting future price changes. 
</p>
<p> The most recent U.S. data are in journals; historical data appear in  The Bowker An-
nual.  Using  The Bowker Annual  may be adequate for some purposes, but one needs to 
be aware that the information that appears in the current volume is almost two years 
old. Preliminary data for books published   during a calendar year appear in  Publishers 
Weekly  (often in late February or early March). Final data appear some months later 
(September or October). The major problem with the published indexes is that when 
preparing a budget request, up-to-date information may not be readily available. 
</p>
<p> Vendors can sometimes provide more current data. Some vendors will provide cus-
tom pricing information, and others may provide a general set of data based on their ex-
perience. A sample of what an acquisitions department might request or receive from a 
book vendor is illustrated in Figure 12.1. It is also possible to obtain information about 
serials subscriptions from a vendor. Figure 12.2 presents a small segment of the data the 
department might receive from a vendor such as EBSCO.   
</p>
<p> Just as libraries prepare budget requests at different times of the year, pricing data 
appear at various times during the year in a variety of sources. The challenge is to find 
the most current data, which may determine whether the library receives requested 
funding. 
</p>
<p> Libraries that purchase a significant number of foreign publications need to esti-
mate the impact of exchange rates. Volatile exchange rates affect buying power almost 
as much as inflation. For example, in January 1985, the pound sterling was at US$1.
2963; in January 1988 it was up to US$1.7813; in 1992 it was US$1.7653; by January 
1994 it was down to US$1.4872, and in March 1999 had moved up to US$1.6064. </p>

<p>Allocation of Monies 231
</p>
<p>During the same period, the Canadian dollar went from US$0.6345 to US$0.7693, then 
to US$0.7913, down to US$0.736, and then to US$0.5199. Although it is impossible to 
accurately forecast the direction and amount of fluctuation in the exchange rates for the 
next 12 months, some effort should go into studying the previous 12 months and at-
tempting to predict future trends. (One source for historic data is the Federal Reserve 
Board&Ecirc;s Web site, at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g5a/.) It is important to 
have good data about the amounts spent in various countries during the previous year. 
The country of publication may be less important than the country in which the vendor 
is located. For example, if the library uses the vendor Harrassowitz, prices will be in eu-
ros regardless of the country of origin of the items purchased. After collecting the data, 
the budgeter can use them as factors in estimating the cost of continuing the current ac-
quisition levels from the countries from which the library normally buys. 
</p>
<p> ALLOCATION OF MONIES 
</p>
<p> A reader would be correct to think dividing up the materials budget is a rather 
complicated process. There are usually three broad slices to the materials budget &bdquo;pie&permil; 
Mark Estes referred to in one of the chapter epigraphs&middot;monographs, serials, and elec-
tronic resources. And, just as in Estes&Ecirc;s vendor scenario, when one slice increases in 
size, more often than not one or both of the other slices get smaller. 
</p>
<p> If there were only three slices, the process would not be very complicated; although 
the people in charge of the three areas, assuming more than one person, might well 
disagree about the size of their respective slices. In most libraries, however, there are 
several other slices to consider. While there may always be some disagreement about 
who gets how much money for materials, today&Ecirc;s stable or shrinking materials budget 
can make for interesting debates regarding who should or must get what. Essentially, it 
a question of whose oxen gets gored. 
</p>
<p> Ordinarily, the method of allocation selected reflects, at least to some degree, the 
priorities in the library&Ecirc;s collection development policy statement. If the library uses a 
collecting-intensity ranking system in the collection development policy, it is reason-
able to expect to find those levels reflected in the amount of money allocated to the sub-
ject or format. Almost all allocation methods are complex, and matching the needs and 
monies available requires that the library consider several factors. 
</p>
<p> From the funding authority&Ecirc;s point of view, it has no interest in how the library de-
cides to allocate the funds provided as long as the library purchases material for the 
collection. However, except in the smallest library, there are usually several staff mem-
bers who would like to have a voice in the allocation discussion. Each person will come 
to the table with a case for why this year his area should be given a bigger slice of the pie. 
Just as the library&Ecirc;s budget request to the funding authority is partly a political process, 
so is the internal budget-allocation process for materials. 
</p>
<p> Each library will have its own categories for allocation, but following are some of 
the more common categories: 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Adult monographs (fiction/nonfiction) 
 &bull; Adult media </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>232 12&mdash;Fiscal Management
</p>
<p> &bull;  Adult serials 
 &bull;  Children&Ecirc;s books 
 &bull;  Children&Ecirc;s magazines 
 &bull;  Children&Ecirc;s media 
 &bull;  Reference department 
 &bull;  Replacement items 
 &bull;  Rental/lease titles 
 &bull;  Young adult (YA) books 
 &bull;  YA magazines 
 &bull;  YA media 
</p>
<p> This list reflects, more or less, a public library environment. When it comes to academic 
and school libraries, the list of categories becomes even more complex. 
</p>
<p> Educational libraries not only have to address the three broad categories of mono-
graphs, serials, and electronic resources and some items on the previous list, such as 
reference and replacements, but they also have teaching departments and faculty mem-
bers lobbying for a slice of the ever-smaller pie, as discussed later. 
</p>
<p> Among the issues that factor into the allocation process are past practices, differen-
tial publication rates, unit cost and inflation rates, level of demand, and actual usage of 
the material. Implementing a formal allocation system takes time and effort. Yet some pro-
fessionals question whether it is worthwhile allocating the monies. Opponents to alloca-
tion claim that it is difficult to develop a fair allocation model, and it is time-consuming 
to calculate the amounts needed. Certainly allocations add to the workload in the acqui-
sitions department as staff have to track more expenditure categories. Those opposed to 
the process also claim that, because the models are difficult to develop, libraries tend to 
leave the allocations in place too long and simply add in the next year&Ecirc;s percentage in-
crease rather than recalculating the figures annually. They suggest that selectors may not 
spend accounts effectively because there is too much or too little money available. Fi-
nally, they argue that it is difficult to effect transfers from one account to another during 
the year. Proponents of allocation claim that it provides better control of collection de-
velopment and is a more effective way to monitor expenditures. 
</p>
<p> A good allocation process provides at least four outcomes. First and foremost, it 
matches, or should match, available funds with actual funding needs. Second, it provides 
selectors with guidelines for how they should allocate their time. That is, if someone is 
responsible for three selection areas with funding allocations of US$15,000, $5,000, 
and $500, it is clear which area requires the most attention. (In many cases, it is more 
difficult to spend the smaller amount, because one must be careful to spend it wisely.) 
Third, the allocation process provides a means of assessing the selector&Ecirc;s work at the end 
of the fiscal year. Finally, it provides the service community with a sense of collecting 
priorities, assuming that the allocation information is made available to them. The library 
can communicate the information in terms of percentages rather than specific mon-
etary amounts if there is a concern about divulging budgetary data. 
</p>
<p> The allocation process should be collaborative, with input from all interested 
parties. Two things are certain, regardless of whether the library uses a formal or infor-
mal approach to gaining input: the process has political overtones, and the outcome will 
invariably disappoint an individual or a group. This is particularly true when introduc-</p>

</p>
<p>ing a revised allocation when the budget is static. Those who receive more money will 
be happy, but those who lose funds will object to the method used to reallocate the 
funds. Unfortunately, sometimes the objectors are influential enough to get the alloca-
tions changed, which defeats the purpose of the process&middot;matching funds to needs. 
Virginia Williams and June Schmidt&Ecirc;s article on book-fund allocation provides a good 
review of the various allocation formulas libraries, especially academic and school li-
braries, employ as well as the pros and cons of each. 8  
</p>
<p> Which allocation method the library selects is influenced, in part, by internal li-
brary practices, institutional needs, and extra-institutional requirements (such as those 
of accreditation agencies). Internal factors include operational practices that determine 
what type of information is readily available to those making the allocation decisions 
(e.g., vendor&Ecirc;s country of origin, number of approval titles versus firm orders, format 
and subject data, and use). How the library organizes its services&middot;centralized or decen-
tralized&middot;also plays a role. Other internal factors affecting which allocation method is 
used include past practices for allocation and the purpose of allocation (that is, its use 
as a control mechanism or guideline). Institutional factors, in addition to the obvious 
importance of the institution&Ecirc;s mission and goals, include the type of budget control it 
uses, its organization, and its overall financial condition. Extra-institutional factors are 
the political atmosphere (for example, the degree of accountability), economic condi-
tions, social expectations and values regarding information services (such as equal 
access and literacy levels), and outside agencies (such as accreditation bodies or gov-
ernmental bodies) that monitor or control the institution. 
</p>
<p> Allocation methods can be regarded as a continuum, with &bdquo;impulse&permil; at one end of 
the scale and &bdquo;formula&permil; at the opposite end. Between the two extremes are several more 
or less structured methods.  Impulse allocations  can take the form of allowing active se-
lectors to have greatest access to available funds or, in a slightly more structured ap-
proach, to allocate on the basis of perceptions of need. History of past use and some 
annual percentage increase for each allocation area is a little more formal; it is prob-
ably one of the most widely used methods. Allocating on the basis of organizational 
structure (main and branch units) is still more formal (often, the allocation is a fixed 
percentage of the fund pool). Adding to that method some incremental funding based 
on workload (such as circulation data) moves the library closer to the formula end of 
the continuum. Also, somewhere in the middle of the continuum is the  format allo-
cation method  (such as funds for books, serials, media, electronic resources, and ref-
erence). 
</p>
<p> Most libraries that use a format allocation system use several approaches. Many 
small libraries, including most school media centers, use the format system, with mono-
graphs, serials, and audiovisuals being the broad groupings. The library divides these 
funds by subject (e.g., language arts), grade level (e.g., fifth grade), or user group (e.g., 
professional reading). 
</p>
<p> Occasionally, libraries divide monograph funds into current, retrospective, and re-
placement categories. In libraries using approval, blanket-order, or standing-order plans, 
it is normal practice to set aside monies for each program before making any other al-
locations. A typical approach would be to set aside an amount equal to the prior year&Ecirc;s 
expenditure for the category with an additional amount to cover expected inflation. 
The reason for setting aside these funds first is that they are ongoing commitments. </p>

</p>
<p>  Formula allocations  have become more and more popular, especially in large 
libraries. Librarians have proposed many formulas over the years; however, no for-
mula has become standard. Each library must decide which, if any, formula is most 
appropriate for its special circumstances. An article by Ian R. Young describes a project 
that compared seven formulas. 9  His results showed that, although each formula used 
one or more unique variables, there were no statistically significant differences among 
the formula results in terms of a single institution. He concluded that there was a high 
degree of similarity among the seven formulas, at least when applied to his institutional 
setting. Based on our experience with formulas and the selection of a formula in several 
institutional settings, we would say that the library selects the formula that contains all 
the variables necessary to satisfy all the interested parties. (Thus, political rather than 
practical considerations dictate which formula is used.) Only quantifiable factors (for 
example, average price, number of titles published, and use data) can be used as vari-
ables in formulas. This does not mean that subjective judgments do not play a role, but 
the allocation process as a whole depends on weightings, circulation data, production 
figures, inflation and exchange rates, number of users, and so forth. Figure 12.3 illus-
trates the allocation formula used at a university library and a small sample of the out-
come of applying such a formula to three teaching departments.

<p>Encumbering 235
</p>
<p> The ALA&Ecirc;s  Guide to Budget Allocation for Information Resources  lists six broad 
allocation methods: historical, zero based (no consideration of past practice), formu-
las, ranking (a variation of formulas), percentages, and other modeling techniques. 10  
The book also outlines some of the variations in formulas by type of library. For exam-
ple, academic libraries might consider enrollment by major or degrees granted in a 
field. Public libraries might factor in differences in the service communities being 
served, the ratio of copies per title of bestsellers to general titles, or the demand (in terms 
of use or requests) in popular subject fields. Special libraries use such factors as delivery-
time expectations of the clients, service charge backs, and the number of clients or de-
partments served. Many school media centers use factors like changes in curriculum, 
number and ability of students by grade level, and loss and aging rates of various sub-
ject areas in the collection. The guide provides a starting point for librarians thinking 
about changing the allocation process their library uses. 
</p>
<p> Allocating funds is an involved process, and changing an existing method is al-
most more difficult than establishing a new one. Often, past practices and political 
issues keep the process from moving forward or evolving. In the case of serials, how 
much to allocate to current materials and how much to allocate to retrospective pur-
chases is related, in part, to the serials inflation rate. If the decision is to maintain 
serials at the expense of monographs, in time there will be a significant need for retro-
spective buying funds to fill gaps in the monograph collection. Subject variations also 
complicate the picture. Science materials are very expensive; social science materials 
are substantially less costly but are more numerous. Electronic access, rather than lo-
cal ownership, also clouds the picture, especially because electronic access often in-
volves cost at the individual level, something with which allocation models have not 
dealt. Although allocation work frequently involves political issues and occasionally 
involves upset individuals, in the long run careful attention to this process will pro-
duce a better collection for the organization the library or information center serves. 
</p>
<p> ENCUMBERING 
</p>
<p> One aspect of accounting and financial management in collection development 
that differs from typical accounting practice is the process of  encumbering.  This is a 
process that allows the library to set aside monies to pay for ordered items. When the 
library waits 60, 90, or 120 days or more for orders, there is some chance that the mon-
ies available will be over- or underspent, if there is no system that allows for setting 
aside monies. 
</p>
<p> The following chart shows how the process works. Day 1, the first day of the fiscal 
year, shows the library with an annual allocation of $1,000 for a particular subject area. 
On day 2, the library orders an item with a list price of $24.95. Although there may be 
shipping and handling charges, there will probably be a discount. Because none of the 
costs and credits are known at the time, the list price is the amount a staff member re-
cords as encumbered. Some departments add a fixed percentage of the list price to the 
total amount encumbered to more closely match what the invoice price will be. The 
unexpended column reflects the $24.95 deduction, with zero showing in the expended 
category. Sixty-two days later, the item and invoice arrive; the invoice reflects a 15 per-
cent discount ($3.74) and no shipping or handling charges. The bookkeeper records </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>236 12&mdash;Fiscal Management
</p>
<p>the actual cost ($21.21) under expended and adds the $3.74 to the unexpended amount. 
The amount encumbered now is zero. 
</p>
<p>  Unexpended Encumbered Expended 
</p>
<p> Day 1 $1000.00 0 0 
 Day 2 $975.05 $24.95 0 
 Day 62 $978.79 0 $21.21 
</p>
<p> This system is much more complex than the example suggests, because libraries place 
and receive multiple orders every day. With each transaction the amounts in each col-
umn change.  Neither the acquisitions department nor the library knows the precise bal-
ance, except on the first and last day of the fiscal year.  If the funding body takes back all 
unexpended funds at the end of the fiscal year (a  cash accounting  system), the acqui-
sitions department staff must know the fund(s) balances as they enter the final quarter 
of the year. 
</p>
<p> Several factors make it difficult to learn the exact status of the funds, even with the 
use of encumbrance. One factor is delivery of orders. Vendors may assure customers 
that they will deliver before the end of the fiscal year but fail to do so. Such a failure can 
result in the encumbered money being lost. With a cash system, the acquisitions depart-
ment staff must make some choices at the end of the fiscal year if there are funds in the 
encumbered category. The main issue is determining if the items still on order are im-
portant enough to leave on order. An affirmative answer has substantial implications for 
collection development. 
</p>
<p> Using the foregoing example and assuming that day 62 comes after the start of a 
new fiscal year and the new allocation is $1,000, on day 1 of the new fiscal year, the 
amount unexpended would be $975.05 ($1,000 minus $24.95), encumbered $24.95, and 
expended zero. In essence, there is a reduction in the amount available for new orders, 
and the library has lost $24.95 from the prior year&Ecirc;s allocation. (One of the authors once 
took over as head of a library on June 25, and the system&Ecirc;s financial officer reported that 
the entire acquisitions allocation was encumbered for the coming fiscal year, starting 
July 1. To have some funds for collection development over the next 12 months, it was 
necessary to cancel 347 orders.) With an  accrual system,  the unexpended funds carry 
forward into the next fiscal year. Under such a system, using the previous example, the 
day 1 figures would be unexpended $1,000, encumbered $24.95, and expended zero. 
</p>
<p> The staff also needs to consider how reliable the vendor or producer is, because 
occasionally an item never arrives. How long should the library wait? The answer var-
ies from producer to producer and country to country. If the library buys substantial 
amounts from developing countries, waiting several years is not unreasonable. Because 
print runs tend to be very close to the number of copies on order, the chance of never be-
ing able to acquire the item makes it dangerous to cancel the order. 
</p>
<p> There is a problem in leaving funds encumbered for long periods under either sys-
tem, especially when there is rapid inflation or exchange rates are unfavorable. The lat-
ter are two reasons why setting a firm but reasonable date for automatic cancellation of 
unfilled orders is important. 
</p>
<p> Other factors making it difficult to know the precise fund balance during the year 
are pricing and discounts. Prices are subject to change without notice on most library 
materials, particularly online resources, which means the price may be higher on de-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Vouchers 237
</p>
<p>livery than when ordered. In addition, discounts are unpredictable. Because of the un-
certainty, most libraries encumber the list price without freight charges and hope the 
amount will be adequate. Exchange rates enter the picture for international acquisitions, 
and the question of when the rate is set can be a critical issue. Certainly, the rate is not firm 
on the date the order is placed, but is it firm at the time of shipment, the date of the in-
voice, the date the library receives the invoice and items, the date the financial office 
issues the check, or even the date the supplier deposits the check? With international 
orders, libraries can expect four months or more to elapse between order placement and 
delivery. In periods of rapid rate changes, even a four-month difference can signifi-
cantly affect the amount of money available for purchases. 
</p>
<p> Shipping and handling rates and taxes on items purchased have also taken a toll 
on collection development funds. Vendors that in the past paid for shipping now pass 
the cost to customers. The U.S. Postal Service has reduced the difference between 
postal rates such as the book rate and parcel post. In 1970 it cost $0.18 to ship a two-
pound book; in 1980 it cost $0.80; by 1999 the rate was $1.54; by 2001 the cost had 
risen to $2.38, and as of early 2010 the price was $2.77 with an additional increase 
scheduled for later in the year. All the charges on the invoice (postage, handling, ship-
ping, taxes, and so forth) must come from the acquisitions budget. As these charges 
mount there is less money to acquire new items. 
</p>
<p> The point of all this work is to allow the library to spend all the materials funds 
available in a timely manner without over-ordering. Remember that an order is a legal 
contract between the library and the supplier. Certainly, most suppliers who have a long-
standing relationship with libraries will understand an occasional overcommitment of 
funds, but they have a legal right to full, prompt payment for all orders placed. One way 
they allow libraries to handle the problem is to ship the order on time but hold the in-
voice until the start of the next fiscal year. 
</p>
<p> A major problem confronting a bookkeeper in the acquisitions department is the 
number of accounts with allocations. In some libraries, the number may run over 200. 
Restricted funds are especially problematic because the library may charge only cer-
tain types of materials to the account. Although the bookkeeper&Ecirc;s job may be to assign 
charges to the various accounts, that person must also know approximately how much 
money remains as free balance, as encumbered, and as expended. As the number of 
accounts goes up, so does the bookkeeper&Ecirc;s workload. 
</p>
<p> Moving monies back and forth, especially in a manual system, can lead to errors, 
so the acquisitions department must have a good bookkeeper. Automated accounting 
systems speed the recording activities and provide greater accuracy, as long as the data 
entry is correct. Despite the uncertainty that exists with the encumbering system, it is 
still better than just having unexpended and expended categories, because without it 
libraries would not know how much of the unexpended balance was actually needed 
for items on order. 
</p>
<p> VOUCHERS 
</p>
<p> Most government accounting methods, as well as the methods used by many other 
organizations, 
</p>
<p> 
 use a voucher system. A  voucher  provides verification of all transactions 
</p>
<p>involving expenditures and the authorization for such expenditures. It is a form that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>238 12&mdash;Fiscal Management
</p>
<p>both summarizes an expenditure and carries the signatures vouching for its correctness. 
Further, it authorizes entry into the books and approves payment of charges. Libraries 
do not usually issue vouchers as such; however, the requirement of the librarian&Ecirc;s sign-
ature on a purchase order and on invoices is part of the voucher system of the library&Ecirc;s 
parent organization (e.g., city, university, school district). 
</p>
<p> Without a voucher, there will be no payment to a vendor. Because it takes a long 
time for a voucher to make its way through a government system, a substantial amount 
of correspondence can occur between the library and vendors regarding when pay-
ments will take place. This points to the need for accurate bookkeeping records and close 
cooperation between bookkeepers in the acquisitions department and the authority that 
finally issues the checks or voucher. 
</p>
<p> ORDER AND INVOICE CONTROL 
</p>
<p> Bookkeepers control the vendor&Ecirc;s compliance with the fiscal regulations of the li-
brary&Ecirc;s governing agency. For example, they are responsible for checking invoices for 
all the required information: signature, purchase order number, and so forth. If materials 
on prepaid orders do not arrive by the end of the fiscal year, the library will request a re-
fund because the vendor may want to hold the money as a credit for future orders. As 
noted previously, it is very convenient to work with the same vendors, because they be-
come familiar with the library&Ecirc;s payment procedures. Whenever a library selects a new 
vendor, it is wise to send a letter explaining the library&Ecirc;s financial arrangements and 
why it may take up to three months to receive payment. 
</p>
<p> RECONCILIATION OF ACCOUNTS 
</p>
<p> One difficulty facing the bookkeeper is knowing precisely where the library stands 
financially. The encumbered amount is always greater than the amount expended be-
cause some items have discounts but not others. Some monthly routines are part of the 
acquisitions department&Ecirc;s bookkeeper workload, such as reconciling the library&Ecirc;s esti-
mate of its financial status with that of the supervising agency. The agency that oversees 
the library&Ecirc;s expenditure of funds will probably not list all of the separate funds used 
internally. Rather, it will show only the amount allocated to the library to buy library ma-
terials. How the library distributes the funds is of no interest to the agency, as long as 
the monies actually go for materials for the collection. The agency&Ecirc;s concern is with 
two categories of funds: expended and unexpended. The library has a third category of 
money&middot;encumbered funds&middot;that makes reconciliation complex. As part of the recon-
ciliation process, the bookkeeper normally creates for each library fund a statement 
of its unencumbered balance, encumbered funds, and liquidated or expended funds. 
When selectors have budgetary responsibility, monthly statements go to them so they 
know their available balance, or they may have the ability to view (but not necessarily 
revise) entries in the online ordering system used by the institution to see real-time bal-
ances in their account(s). The final reconciliation sheet shows when the library re-
ceived an invoice, the dealer&Ecirc;s invoice number, the amount of money encumbered, and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Audits 239
</p>
<p>the discount received. The next column (net) indicates the amount actually paid to the 
dealer for the items; the tax column represents the tax on the monies expended. 
</p>
<p> The library must also carry out a number of end-of-fiscal-year routines, and the 
bookkeeper is responsible for many of these. The library is normally on a one-year fis-
cal cycle (a cash accounting system, as mentioned earlier). That is, any money remain-
ing in the library&Ecirc;s budget at the end of the fiscal year reverts to the funding agency. 
Libraries are seldom able to carry any unexpended funds forward into the next fiscal 
year, including encumbered funds. Therefore, several months prior to the end of the fis-
cal year, it is necessary to check with the vendors on outstanding orders to determine 
whether they will make delivery in time. If they are unable to deliver the items before 
the fiscal year ends, libraries usually cancel the order and place one for something that 
is available or will be available before the end of the fiscal year. This year-end exercise 
can create bookkeeping nightmares. 
</p>
<p> The bookkeeper&Ecirc;s primary duty is to ensure that the library neither overspends nor 
underspends its budget. Because discounts and cancellations are unknown quantities 
up until the moment the invoice arrives, it becomes a challenge for the bookkeeper to 
estimate accurately just where the library stands financially. 
</p>
<p> AUDITS 
</p>
<p> Are audits really necessary in libraries? Must libraries remember how, where, 
when, and on what it spent every cent? (An enjoyable short poem by Robert Frost en-
titled the &bdquo;Hardship of Accounting&permil; addresses the issue of accounting and audits; see 
http://varietyreading.carlsguides.com/forwards/hardship.php). Unfortunately, the an-
swer is  yes  when it comes to library funds. Some years ago, Herbert Snyder and Julia 
Hersberger published an article outlining embezzlement in public libraries. The article 
makes it clear why regular financial audits are necessary. 11  
</p>
<p> There are three basic audit types.  Operational audits  examine an organization &rsquo; s 
procedures and practices, usually with the goal of making improvements.  Compliance 
audits  examine how well an organization is following procedures established by some 
higher-level body. An example might be to determine if the acquisitions department 
has followed the procedures for funds received through a federal government Library 
Services and Construction Act grant. A  financial audit  is what comes to people &rsquo; s minds 
when they hear the word &bdquo;audit.&permil; It is often a yearly event for the acquisitions depart-
ment wherein its records are examined by nonlibrary personnel to assure the funding 
authority and other parties that the monies were in fact expended in the expected way 
and that the records of those transactions comply with standard accounting practices 
and guidelines. One aspect of having the power to manage and expend substantial 
amounts of money is fiscal accountability. The amount of money does not need to be 
substantial if it involves public or private funds. For acquisitions departments, the au-
ditor&Ecirc;s visit is probably second only to the annual performance appraisal process in terms 
of worry and stress on the staff&Ecirc;s part. The worry is not that they have done something 
wrong, but rather their not being able to find some type of documentation that an au-
ditor wishes to check. 
</p>
<p> A legalistic definition of an  audit  is the process of accumulating and evaluating 
evidence about quantifiable information of an economic entity to determine and report </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>240 12&mdash;Fiscal Management
</p>
<p>on the degree of correspondence between the information and established criteria. More 
simply put, it is the process of ensuring that the financial records are accurate and that 
the information is presented correctly using accepted accounting practices, and mak-
ing recommendations for improvements in how the process is carried out. The basic 
questions and required records relate to whether the purchase was made with proper 
authorization, was received, and was paid for in an appropriate manner, and whether the 
item is still available. (If the item is not still available, there should be appropriate re-
cords regarding its disposal.) With automated acquisitions systems, undergoing an au-
dit is less time consuming than in the past, where the paper trail was in fact a number of 
different paper records that had to be gathered and compared. At least now the compu-
ter system can pull up the necessary information fairly quickly. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> Financial management, bookkeeping, and a basic understanding of how trained 
bookkeepers do their work is important in an acquisitions department. Libraries are ac-
countable for the funds they receive, and the acquisitions department is one of the few 
places in the library where library funds are committed to obligations. For most libraries, 
the two largest segments of the budget are staff salaries and monies to build the col-
lections. Only the collection development funds are actually available for the staff to 
expend. It is important for the staff to understand and use proper bookkeeping methods. 
This chapter covers only the most elementary aspects of accounting, but the concepts 
and terms that technical services staff should be familiar with include  account, balance 
sheet, credit, daybook, debit, double-entry accounting, journalizing, ledger, posting, en-
cumbering, trail balance, voucher, account reconciliation,  and  audit.  Additional re-
sources are listed in the Suggested reading section. 
</p>
<p> Libraries must be constantly aware of changes in prices and invoicing practices to 
gain the maximum number of additions to the collection. Watch for changes, and de-
mand explanations of freight and handling charges, inappropriate dual-pricing systems, 
or other costs that may place additional strain on the budget. By understanding basic 
accounting principles and using the reports and records generated by the library&Ecirc;s ac-
counting system, the library will be better able to monitor the use of available monies 
and use them effectively to meet the needs of the public.

<p>13  Overview and Decisions 
</p>
<p> Our present practices are not based on &bdquo;by guess and by golly.&permil; They are based 
on centuries of pragmatic experience, culminating in the ISBD [International 
Standard Bibliographic Description] selection and order of elements. The data 
needed to identify a resource changes little whether the resource is incunabula 
or a remote electronic resource, nor whether the data is on a 3 &times; 5 in. card or is 
electronic.

<p> Until the middle of the 20th century, local library catalogs were valuable solely as 
guides to individual library collections, establishing the presence or absence of mate-
rials wanted by people using a library. As Charles Cutter put it, the purpose of a library 
catalog was 
</p>
<p>  1. To enable a person to find a book when one of the following is known: 
</p>
<p>  a. the author 
  b. the title 
  c. the subject 
</p>
<p>  2. To show what the library has 
</p>
<p>  d. by a given author 
  e. on a given subject 
  f. in a given kind of literature 
</p>
<p>  3. To assist in the choice of a book 
</p>
<p>  g. as to the edition (bibliographically) 
  h. as to its character (literary or topical)1 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>246 13&mdash;Overview and Decisions
</p>
<p> Until the advent of computers in the latter half of the 20th century, all a catalog re-
cord revealed was that the title it represented was once purchased by the library and as-
signed a place on the shelves. The answer it could not give was &bdquo;Can I have this material 
now?&permil; By the end of the 20th century, when online catalogs were linked to order files 
and borrowing files, the availability of materials could also be determined using the 
catalog, greatly enhancing search results. In the 21st century, local library catalogs have 
become gateways to a much larger universe of knowledge than is held by any individ-
ual library. This expanded reach, however, does not obviate the need for good catalog-
ing at the local level. It makes the work done at local levels more important than ever, 
because it is the foundation for a wider range of bibliographic services to clients far from 
and near to the local library. 
</p>
<p> THE RATIONALE FOR GOOD CATALOGING 
</p>
<p> As stated in chapter 1, quality user service is a high-priority goal of technical ser-
vices. Catalogs, which were once considered tools intended primarily for librarians, now 
serve a broad range of library users, including children and adults, scholars and students, 
well-read searchers and searchers with little reading experience, as well as librarians as-
sisting people in person, online, or via telephone reference service. Catalogs must be 
navigable by all of these varied constituencies, and able to give them easy-to-obtain, ac-
curate information that is sufficiently complete to answer their questions and facilitate 
their use of library collections. 
</p>
<p> Collection size has changed dramatically over time. The Library of Congress&Ecirc;s 
(LC) collection, which was destroyed during the War of 1812, was reestablished with the 
acquisition of Thomas Jefferson&Ecirc;s library, totaling almost 7,000 volumes. At the time, 
Jefferson&Ecirc;s was an unusually large personal library, and had grown under LC steward-
ship to more than one million volumes by the turn of the 20th century. Nowadays, small 
libraries (as defined by the publishers of cataloging tools intended for their use, such 
as  Sears List of Subject Headings  and the  Abridged Dewey Decimal Classification ) 
might hold as many as 20,000 volumes;2 libraries in colleges and small universities, large 
towns, and small cities might be expected to have collections of 250,000 to 500,000 
volumes or more. Libraries in research universities and large cities often number their 
holdings at more than a million volumes. Looking for one wanted title among so many 
possibilities on the shelves requires orderly, well-thought-out arrangements to make 
them readily available for use. It could take a person a long time spent examining each 
volume one at a time to learn whether desired materials are present. 
</p>
<p> All borrowers may not able to visit the library in person. In the 21st century, more 
and more members of a local library&Ecirc;s public are virtual visitors. They need to find out 
whether the library has the materials they want before they go to it in person. Some are 
unable to visit the library in person, but can obtain its analog materials through shared 
borrowing services, such as interlibrary loan (ILL), and its digital materials through 
electronic delivery systems. To do this, however, they must know if the materials they 
want are part of the collection and available. Therefore, one of the most important ser-
vices libraries can provide to the people that use them is accurate, up-to-date biblio-
graphic information. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Cataloging and Classification Processes 247
</p>
<p> Both of these modern-day library features&middot;the large size of local collections and 
the increasing numbers of people who can use the materials without coming to the li-
brary building in person&middot;make having effective bibliographic services worthwhile. 
</p>
<p> Libraries can provide both  direct  and  indirect access  to the materials in their col-
lections. For analog materials physically stored in a library&Ecirc;s collection, direct access is 
provided through an efficient shelving system that groups materials on the same sub-
jects. Direct access is also known as  physical  or  shelf access,  because people can go di-
rectly to the physical objects that make up the collections. Direct access to electronic 
documents can be accomplished by means of virtual shelving systems that facilitate 
locating and retrieving desired materials. 
</p>
<p> Indirect access leads people to substitutes or surrogates for the materials&middot;the cat-
alog records stored in library catalogs&middot;that can be manipulated and searched more 
quickly and easily than the materials themselves. (In the electronic world, catalog re-
cords are known as  metadata. ) Indirect access is also known as  bibliographic access, 
intellectual access,  or  catalog access.  If a search of the catalog establishes that the 
desired material is part of the collection, the surrogate will show how to retrieve it, ei-
ther from the library&Ecirc;s shelves or an electronic collection. This is how libraries make 
finding individual items easy and fast, even when they are part of extremely large col-
lections. 
</p>
<p> CATALOGING AND CLASSIFICATION PROCESSES 
</p>
<p> Cataloging, in broad terms, is the process of preparing surrogate records for the 
materials in local library collections. Filed together in catalogs under the headings that 
Cutter suggested&middot;authors, titles, and subjects&middot;these surrogates enable a person to find 
the materials by &bdquo;letting their fingers do the walking,&permil; to paraphrase the Yellow Pages 
slogan. Classification is part of the process of arranging the materials in an orderly 
fashion by subject on shelves&middot;whether physical or virtual shelves&middot;making it quick 
and easy to obtain the materials themselves. Cataloging and classification add to pub-
lic service by saving people time and effort in getting materials from their libraries. 
</p>
<p> Information that identifies materials in catalog records may begin as part of an 
order record. When a title is acquired, technical services staff members document the 
transactions, such as placing orders for the materials, receiving them, and paying for 
them. Cataloging operations begin with the basic information used for the order. In many 
instances this is downloaded from a supplier&Ecirc;s database derived from a larger catalog, 
such as the LC&Ecirc;s machine-readable cataloging (MARC) database or the Online Com-
puter Library Center&Ecirc;s (OCLC) WorldCat network database. Local library catalogers 
edit or add to this basic information to produce a complete, accurate record for the ma-
terial known as a  bibliographic record  or  &bdquo;bib&permil;  record, for short. When the information 
is not derived from a national library or a network database, catalogers match the data 
with the material and add missing data to ensure that the bib record is complete and cor-
rect. Bib records include a full description of the material and its content, and an as-
signed call number (shelf address) that tells where the material is stored in the library&Ecirc;s 
stacks, storage facilities, digital files, or elsewhere. 
</p>
<p> Rules govern the kinds of data that appear in bib records, how they are recorded, 
which elements are used for retrieving the records from the file (known variously as </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>248 13&mdash;Overview and Decisions
</p>
<p>headings, access points, and tracings), and how the retrieval elements are formatted. In 
addition to Cutter&Ecirc;s three retrieval elements&middot;authors, titles, and subjects&middot;catalogs can 
be searched by call numbers; keywords; unique numbers such as International Standard 
Book Numbers (ISBNs), International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs), and network 
control numbers; and combinations of these elements with languages, physical formats, 
and dates. The software that governs catalog systems can make almost every word in 
catalog records retrievable through keyword searching, although this is not a typical 
feature. 
</p>
<p> The completed bib records, arranged by call number, are the basis for inventory 
control, to which more information is added: where and when items originated and were 
made part of the library collection, how much they cost, and where they were assigned 
to be stored. The circulation system adds still more information to these records, such 
as whether the items are in their assigned location or not, and, if not, who has borrowed 
them and when they are due back at the library. Thus, the catalog is simultaneously a 
reference tool for library users and staff seeking to find materials as well as for col-
lection managers seeking to keep track of the library&Ecirc;s stock. 
</p>
<p> DECISIONS 
</p>
<p> Local libraries must make choices about what kinds of cataloging and classifica-
tion systems they will adopt in giving access to their collections, both direct access if 
collections are stored in open shelves and users are able to visit the building, and/or 
indirect access via a public catalog if shelves are closed or users cannot visit in person. 
In the 21st century, few libraries make these decisions in isolation. They are influenced 
by what other libraries in their area do, what peer libraries serving similar kinds of con-
stituencies do, and what they have done in the past. The most basic decision, however, 
might well be to follow library-wide standards that govern cataloging and classifica-
tion. Standards aim to ensure quality. Standard methods can be less costly than custom-
ized ones, even when the customized method appears to be simpler. For one thing, 
products available in the marketplace are geared to standards and are likely to be famil-
iar to the people who are going to use them. 
</p>
<p> A second important overall decision is whether new catalog records will be pre-
pared in the library or purchased in finished form from outside sources. Advantages of 
preparing catalog records in-house are that local librarians can control the operations 
in a manner that serves their local needs and priorities, implement variations from the 
standards if they believe them to be important, and utilize staff and budget resources as 
they see fit. Purchasing finished catalog records from outside sources puts control of 
both the operations and the products in the hands of outside organizations, which might 
or might not be good for the local library in terms of cost, quality, and speed. This does 
not need to be an either-or decision&middot;some catalog records might be purchased and oth-
ers prepared in-house&middot;and either choice involves more decision making. 
</p>
<p> Buying finished catalog records requires finding a reliable source that will supply 
the records needed by the library at least as quickly as they can be prepared in-house, 
and do so at cost and quality levels equal to or better than library-produced records. If 
a local library has an operating catalog department, its products, turnaround time, and 
costs can be compared with alternative sources, and decisions made on the basis of the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Decisions 249
</p>
<p>actual performance of each source. A decision to buy finished catalog records requires 
negotiating a contract with the source organization that ensures the performance of both 
the seller (preparing quality records detailing the library&Ecirc;s specific needs at agreed-upon 
prices in an agreed-upon time frame) and the buyer (paying the seller according to 
the agreed-upon schedule and keeping to the agreed-upon services), and protects both 
parties from departures from the agreement. 
</p>
<p> A decision to prepare records in the library is not the final one. Library catalog de-
partments can operate in different ways. Few departments prepare every record them-
selves from scratch. Most libraries divide their catalog operations into materials for 
which source records are readily available that can be used as the basis for finished re-
cords, called &bdquo;copy&permil; cataloging, and materials that have no such data and must be pre-
pared from scratch, called &bdquo;original&permil; cataloging. Many libraries buy cataloging data 
to use in preparing their records in-house. Sources for cataloging data include free 
Cataloging-in-Publication found in books and some other library materials, subscrip-
tions to LC&Ecirc;s MARC records, or the databases of bibliographic networks such as 
OCLC and AMICUS, or to other kinds of shared cataloging organizations. 
</p>
<p> No matter where and by whom catalog records are prepared, decisions about the 
details of cataloging products are important and include the following: 
</p>
<p> &bull; How much information should be given in bibliographic descriptions? 
 &bull; Which subject authority(ies) should be the source(s) for subject descriptors? 
 &bull; What classification system should be used as the basis for shelf addresses? 
 &bull; Will the library maintain a local authority file for the headings used in its 
</p>
<p>catalog? 
</p>
<p> Bibliographic Levels 
</p>
<p> Descriptive cataloging rules, which will be covered in chapter 14, permit three 
distinct models for standard bibliographic description, called bibliographic levels. Li-
braries may choose the simplest style, level 1, if they have no need for much detail. This 
level does not require selected elements of information, such as subtitles and other title 
details, secondary publishers and distributors, or information about the series to which 
materials belong. Level 1 is the model for records in national bibliographic networks 
that can be called standard even though they contain less data than that needed to qual-
ify as full-level cataloging. Bibliographic level 2 requires more information. It is the 
model used by national bibliographic networks for full-level cataloging. The third and 
most complex bibliographic level is not widely used; it requires the inclusion of all the 
data that result from applying every rule relevant to the materials being cataloged. These 
three levels are demonstrated in Figure 13.1.    
</p>
<p> The choice of bibliographic level should be made according to the following cri-
teria: the size of the catalog; the number of materials likely to have similar bibliographic 
data; the knowledge levels of the people using the catalog; and the desired value of the 
catalog for research purposes. The larger the catalog, the more likely it is that greater 
detail is needed to distinguish similar materials and the more likely the collection it rep-
resents contains larger numbers of materials that are so similar they can be confused. 
Small catalogs representing general collections might be expected to avoid such prob-
lems by having fewer materials that are enough alike to cause confusion. However, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>250 13&mdash;Overview and Decisions
</p>
<p>Figure 13.1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Decisions 251
</p>
<p>small catalogs representing specialized collections might have records for many sim-
ilar materials and, thus, require more detail to identify them uniquely. 
</p>
<p> When the people who search library catalogs are experts, they can be expected to 
understand and use added bibliographic information in catalog records. If the catalog 
is used for research purposes, such details as specific editors and translators, publishers 
and distributors, casts, illustrative matter, bibliographies and indexes are likely to play a 
role in the selection and use of materials. Bibliographic level 1 would not furnish enough 
data to satisfy their needs. For most institutions, level 2 is chosen to satisfy the needs of 
expert researchers. However, in some instances, even bibliographic level 2 might not be 
sufficient, warranting the additional detail mandated by level 3. 
</p>
<p> Subject Authorities 
</p>
<p> At one time, local libraries chose one general subject authority as the source for sub-
ject descriptors, such as  Sears List of Subject Headings  (Sears) or  Library of Congress 
Subject Headings  (LCSH). The choice was usually made on the basis of library type and 
size; small school and public libraries used Sears, though some used LCSH and its sub-
set of descriptors for children&Ecirc;s materials (formerly known as Annotated Card headings, 
</p>
<p>Figure 13.1&mdash;Continued</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>252 13&mdash;Overview and Decisions
</p>
<p>now renamed Children&Ecirc;s and Young Adults&Ecirc; Cataloging Program; see chapters 16 and 
17). Other libraries (larger school and public libraries, academic libraries, and special 
libraries) generally used LCSH, though they sometimes also used its Children&Ecirc;s and 
Young Adults&Ecirc; Cataloging Program for the children&Ecirc;s catalogs. In the 21st century, 
however, use of multiple subject authorities has become commonplace. 
</p>
<p> Specialized vocabularies for art, medicine, literary and film genres, and other sub-
jects can be used together with a general vocabulary, most often LCSH. The first deci-
sion by general libraries about subject authorities continues to be a choice between Sears 
and LCSH, but it may not be the only decision to be made. Libraries with collections 
in specialized subject areas often make a second and/or third decision to use special-
ized subject vocabularies for materials in those fields. Rather than conflict with the gen-
eral descriptors, the specialized descriptors augment a catalog&Ecirc;s retrieval vocabulary 
and enhance search success for the specialized materials to which they are applied. 
</p>
<p> Classification Systems 
</p>
<p> Most general libraries choose to arrange their materials on the shelves using call 
numbers based on the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) or the Library of Congress 
Classification (LCC). For the most part, school and public libraries use DDC and ac-
ademic libraries use LCC, although there are many exceptions to this rule of thumb. 
Specialized libraries might use DDC or LCC, but they might also prefer a classification 
designed for their subject area, such as the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Clas-
sification for medical materials or the Los Angeles County Law Library Classification 
for legal materials.3 Specialized classifications have been developed for music, art, en-
gineering, and other subject fields as well as for medicine and law. In some libraries, a 
specialized system may be used solely for materials in the special subject area, while 
DDC or LCC is used for materials in all the other areas. This is what is done at the NLM. 
It uses NLM Classification for medical materials and LCC for the rest. 
</p>
<p> Classification numbers alone do not provide enough detail for shelving purposes. 
Standard practice in all types of libraries is to add shelf marks to classification numbers 
to create addresses known as  call numbers  for materials. Shelf marks identify elements 
of materials other than their subject matter, such as authors&Ecirc; names, publication dates, 
and titles. Among the shelf marks, cutter numbers&middot;coded versions of a word from the 
most important descriptive heading&middot;are usually the first to be assigned. Cutter numbers 
usually consist of an initial letter followed by one or more digits representing letters of 
the word. Lists of Cutter numbers representing author surnames are available for this 
purpose,4 or the numbers can be derived from the application of a few simple rules, de-
scribed in chapter 18. Cutter letters&middot;a simpler form&middot;may be preferred in which only 
an initial letter or the first few letters of the word are given. 
</p>
<p> Large libraries add more shelf marks, such as dates and title letters, to distinguish 
among large numbers of materials bearing the same classification number. Small li-
braries with fewer materials on the same subject may use only one type of shelf mark 
and give it in simplified form. Nothing requires that a library give each material a unique 
call number, although such is the practice at LC and other libraries. In some libraries, 
several different materials can share a single call number. 
</p>
<p> Another kind of decision involving shelf arrangements is whether material will be 
deployed by call number in one sequence or several, depending on the physical format </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Catalog Displays 253
</p>
<p>of the materials, the age of the materials, their donors, departments, or other factors. 
The list of shelving practices that deploy materials in more than one shelf sequence is 
long. Separate shelf sequences for reference and circulating materials are common, as 
are multiple sequences for books, audiovisuals, music, recordings, and so on. Some-
times the physical format&ndash;related sequences involve the use of different classification 
systems for selected media. Some public libraries exclude most (but not all) fiction ma-
terials from the classification, arranging them by author surname unless the material in-
cludes criticism and/or editorial notes in addition to the work itself. In the latter event, 
they are classified and shelved in the regular sequence. Similarly, some libraries place 
biographies in a separate section arranged by the subjects&Ecirc; surnames. Some libraries 
divide fiction into genres, with separate shelves for novels, mysteries, westerns, science 
fiction, short stories, and so on. Some libraries shelve periodicals alphabetically by ti-
tle in a periodicals unit, regardless of their subject matter. 
</p>
<p> Other common shelving practices exclude recent acquisitions from the main se-
quence of shelving, placing them in prominent locations near entrances or circulation 
desks and arranging them by title or author, or, if only a small number are involved, in 
random order. Many libraries maintain local history collections, excluding these mate-
rials from the rest of the history sequence in DDC or LCC and placing them in unique 
arrangements in separate rooms or alcoves. Because of the difficulty of cataloging older 
historical materials, some libraries do not catalog them at all, relying instead on re-
searchers browsing the shelves to find what they want. All of these shelving anomalies 
make discovery by browsing the main classification sequence difficult, if not impossi-
ble. Fortunately, maintaining a good-quality catalog helps people achieve greater suc-
cess in finding desired materials under these circumstances. 
</p>
<p> CATALOG DISPLAYS 
</p>
<p> The technologies used for library catalogs have changed over time. Until the end of 
the 19th century, library catalogs resembled bibliographies or publishers&Ecirc; catalogs in 
that the catalog records were written or printed in book-like volumes in which several 
lines of text were devoted to identifying and describing each title. For economy&Ecirc;s sake, 
book catalogs sometimes gave only one listing per title under a single heading, although 
multiple listings for author, title, and/or subject headings could be made if a library 
wished to invest in a bigger, more elaborate, book catalog. Some book catalogs were 
beautifully made. Librarians seeking to obtain valuable materials as gifts from wealthy 
owners used such catalogs to show potential donors how an elegantly made book cat-
alog listing their contributed titles could give donors lasting recognition as collectors 
and philanthropists. 
</p>
<p> From the end of the 19th century and into the first part of the 20th, card technology 
was introduced and quickly became popular. Cards were the principal catalog tech-
nology for almost a century. The catalog records, printed on 3- &times; 5-inch cards, were filed 
in drawers designed to hold hundreds of cards per drawer. Card technology had a num-
ber of advantages: the cards were inexpensive to produce; cards for individual titles 
could be duplicated easily to create multiple headings; and card files were hospitable 
to changes as new materials were added and old ones removed, whereas book catalogs 
had to be completely reprinted to reflect any change made after an edition went to press. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>254 13&mdash;Overview and Decisions
</p>
<p>The principal disadvantages of card technology were limitations on the amount of 
information a 3- &times; 5-inch card could hold and the difficulty of duplicating entire cata-
logs. These problems were not so important in the early 20th century when people were 
expected to go to their local library in person and could browse through materials if 
the catalog records did not give them enough information to determine the usefulness 
of a particular material. 
</p>
<p> In the middle of the 20th century, the term &bdquo;card catalog&permil; was a synonym for &bdquo;li-
brary catalog,&permil; but the increasing output of new books and journals from publishers and 
infusions of money for new materials from government sources made it difficult for 
catalog departments to keep up with the workload. It was not unusual for large academic 
and public libraries to have backlogs of unfiled cards large enough to keep filers work-
ing for years and equally daunting backlogs of materials awaiting cataloging. Interest 
in using newly developed computers to speed cataloging operations was keen. Efforts 
to translate bibliographic records to digitized entries proceeded throughout the 1950s 
and early 1960s, culminating in the establishment of the MARC database at LC in the 
1960s. In 1967, the newly established OCLC5&middot;the first shared cataloging network&middot;
adopted MARC and soon launched its operations. 
</p>
<p> Both the LC and OCLC databases were initially programmed to produce cards. 
OCLC&Ecirc;s cards were not printed as elegantly as LC&Ecirc;s, but they had the distinct advantage 
of arriving with added entries already printed on them, all arranged in alphabetic order. 
In contrast, LC cards came as &bdquo;unit cards&permil; requiring library staff to add all the head-
ings but the main entry and, then, alphabetize the groups of cards before they could be 
filed. Not until the 1980s did the advent of microcomputers bring the cost of computers 
down to levels that libraries of all sizes and types could afford, and allow the shift to 
fully computerized catalogs to gain momentum. 
</p>
<p> Ten years later, the computer revolution was close to complete. Card files were 
superseded by online public access catalogs (OPACs) following a decade of instabil-
ity during which computer-produced cards were superseded by hybrid technologies 
such as computer-produced microfilm catalogs and batch-loaded CD-ROM catalogs. 
These were followed by online catalogs connected to their hosts by telephone lines 
and, eventually, by Internet-connected networks. 
</p>
<p> Pioneers in a few university libraries such as those at Stanford, Northwestern, and 
Brigham Young, developed local OPAC software based on database management sys-
tem programming. Some succeeded in broadening and refining the software package 
so other libraries could use it and offered it for sale.6 At the same time, some com-
mercial suppliers developed proprietary OPAC software and offered these products in 
the marketplace. The library automation marketplace that began developing in the late 
1970s has fluctuated ever since as new vendors enter the field and veterans drop out 
or merge. 
</p>
<p> OPAC systems continue to evolve as computer technology evolves. As a result, 
different OPAC systems have varying display capabilities. Most provide for brief and 
full displays as well as displays with eye-readable tags (e.g., title, author, edition) or 
codes (MARC content designators, discussed in chapter 19). Some provide a choice of 
card style entries with data grouped into paragraphs, as on cards, or into field-by-field 
displays with one data element per line. Some can accept input and display catalog re-
cords in multiple scripts with many symbols and diacritics, while others are limited to 
the roman alphabet and have only a small selection of the most popularly used symbols </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>and diacritics (for example, those found on a QWERTY keyboard). Libraries might want 
their OPAC to have all these options or only some, determined by local needs and/or 
the costs of obtaining them. Libraries might select one set of display options for catalog 
stations in public areas and a different set for staff-only areas. In addition, changes to 
catalog databases are usually made only by staff, requiring a system of authorization to 
thwart accidental or deliberate tampering. Figure 13.2 illustrates several OPAC screen 
styles.

<p> A WORD ABOUT THE FIGURES AND EXAMPLES 
</p>
<p> Most of the figures in chapters 14 and 15 that highlight descriptive cataloging rules   
are done in the format used in cataloging-in-publication (CIP) records usually found 
on the versos of title pages, because CIP is frequently the basis on which catalog re-
cords are built and because it is easier to demonstrate cataloging principles without the 
distraction of computer encoding. All of the figures include &bdquo;tracings,&permil; that is, the sub-
ject headings and additional descriptive headings that are added to the records in the 
course of normal cataloging procedures, and some of the figures also include suggested 
classification numbers. A student can refer back to these examples when using the chap-
ters dealing with subject headings and classification numbers. In chapter 18, &bdquo;MARC 
Format and Metadata,&permil; illustrative catalog records contain standard MARC coding. The 
subfield codes in these records have been separated from the terms by a space to make 
the coding more understandable to the beginning cataloger. 
</p>
<p> Some of the figures highlight the difference between LC and the Sears lists of sub-
ject headings and between the DDC and the LCC schemes. Students can find these 
particular figures by consulting the index. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Review Questions 257
</p>
<p> Double hyphens (--) have been used in place of dashes in the subject headings be-
cause it is easy for beginners to confuse single hyphens and dashes. 
</p>
<p> No textbook can supply all the practice students might want or need to polish their 
cataloging and classification skills. A graduate cataloger will learn the needs of a li-
brary&Ecirc;s system on the job. The authors believe it is not difficult to do high-quality, stan-
dard cataloging. It just takes the right knowledge, a little confidence, and practice. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> The goal of cataloging is to provide public service. Traditionally seen as a tool for 
librarians, today all kinds of people search the catalog themselves to find material 
quickly and easily in ever-larger local library collections. Catalogs have long been rec-
ognized as the keys to library collections. In the 21st century, catalogs are essential tools 
for people who cannot visit the library in person. A growing proportion of borrowers 
are external users&middot;faculty and students at remote campuses of a university or at other 
universities, people living beyond town or city borders, or students in unaffiliated 
schools and school districts&middot;that borrow local materials through interlibrary loans and 
other cooperative programs. External users rely on catalog data to find what they need. 
</p>
<p> Individual libraries must make policy decisions about their catalogs and the data 
that go into them. The most important decision is to conform to library-wide standards, 
because doing so enables local libraries to benefit from many cataloging products and 
programs. Adopting standard rules and tools used in preparing catalog records from 
scratch requires corollary decisions about how much data to include, which options for 
specific kinds of materials to adopt, which subject authorities and classification systems 
to use, and what should be added to classification numbers to create call numbers. Clas-
sified materials may be deployed in one sequence or several. In addition, local libraries 
need to make choices about the kinds of catalogs they provide and how cataloging in-
formation is displayed. Computer catalogs require encoding systems for data entry. 
</p>
<p> Another basic decision that needs to be made by local libraries is whether to pre-
pare catalog records within the library or obtain them from outside organizations. Chap-
ter 19 discusses hybrid operations &bdquo;copy cataloging,&permil; in which local catalogers start 
with data obtained from outside sources, but employ it in their in-house workflow.

<p> Bibliographic description: [T]he aspect of cataloging concerned with the bib-

<p> Building a standard cataloging record from scratch usually begins by describ-
ing the material according to an accepted set of rules. At this writing, those rules are 
the  Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules,  second edition, 2002 revision, 2005 update 
(AACR2-2005).1 After a description is completed, author and title access points derived 
from it are selected and put into appropriate form. The choice and form of these access 
points are also governed by rules in AACR2-2005. Later, other tools are used to select 
and assign subject descriptors, a classification number, and shelf marks that complete a 
shelf address for the material. This chapter describes the first part of the process: creat-
ing bibliographic descriptions. 
</p>
<p> AACR2: PAST AND PRESENT 
</p>
<p> AACR2-2005, the current standard, is available in two forms: in print and online. 
The print version is sold as unbound, prepunched pages that owners of a previously is-
sued AACR2 loose-leaf binder edition can put in the old binder or in any other binder 
of sufficient size (new AACR2 binders are no longer available). The online edition is 
part of the Library of Congress&Ecirc;s (LC)  Cataloger&Ecirc;s Desktop  product, available by sub-
scription from LC.2 The online AACR2-2005 is completely indexed, enabling catalog-
ers to search by any word in the text or by rule numbers. Search words can be truncated </p>

<p>and combined using AND, OR, and NOT. Users can bookmark and highlight items, 
and they can annotate the text. Links help users move through the text quickly, and 
multiple windows can display different pages of text simultaneously. In addition,  Cat-
aloger&Ecirc;s Desktop  contains hundreds of valuable reference tools, including LC Rule In-
terpretations and Library and Archives Canada (LAC) Rule Interpretations,  Subject 
Cataloging Manual: Subject Headings,  OCLC&Ecirc;s  Bibliographic Formats and Stan-
dards,  machine-readable cataloging (MARC) 21 and other MARC tables, ALA-LC Ro-
manization tables,  Library of Congress Filing Rules,  the LC Classification Outline, the 
 Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus,  and many more important cataloging tools, which save 
time when catalogers have them at their fingertips. 
</p>
<p> Anglo-American cooperation goes back to 1908, when the first international code 
of cataloging rules was issued jointly by British and American librarians. The meet-
ing of minds from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean was disrupted during and after 
World War II, when the American Library Association unilaterally published a new 
code of rules for access points in 1949. Joint efforts resumed soon after the war&Ecirc;s end. 
In 1961, due in large part to the effort of the Library of Congress&Ecirc;s Seymour Lubetzky, 
an International Conference on Cataloguing Principles was convened in Paris. The meet-
ing resulted in a statement of principles on which cataloging rules were to be based, 
known as the Paris Principles.3 
</p>
<p> Efforts following the Paris conference to forge a new Anglo-American cataloging 
code resulted in the publication of the  Anglo-American Cataloging Rules  (AACR1) in 
1967. All the differences between British and North American librarians could not be 
resolved, so AACR1 was published in two versions: one for the British and another for 
North Americans. Even their titles differed: the British text used the &bdquo;u&permil; in  cataloguing;  
the North American text did not. 
</p>
<p> AACR1 was designed for use in large research libraries and did not address the 
concerns of other kinds of libraries. Catalogers in these other libraries wanted more 
flexibility in the standard, more effective rules for new materials, more examples to aid 
in applying the rules, and recognition of the way computers were affecting descriptive 
cataloging. In 1974, AACR1&Ecirc;s publishers formed the Joint Steering Committee for Re-
vision of AACR and charged it with being the final authority on the rules. The result of 
their efforts was a second edition (AACR2) published simultaneously in 1978 by the 
American Library Association, the Canadian Library Association, and the United King-
dom&Ecirc;s Library Association (now called the Chartered Institute of Library and Informa-
tion Professionals). The second edition has been officially revised four times, in 1988, 
1998, 2002, and 2005, and the various versions have been updated many times to in-
corporate revisions into one text. 
</p>
<p> Beginning in 1978, AACR2&Ecirc;s rules applied to all materials, incorporating the In-
ternational Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) sponsored by the International 
Federation of Library Associations and Organizations (IFLA). The ISBD mandated a 
uniform outline consisting of eight bibliographic elements, a system for punctuating 
them, the order in which they should appear, and the sources to be consulted for the 
data. The same structure applied to all materials, thereby producing catalog records that 
could be integrated into one catalog. The punctuation&middot;called confusing and superflu-
ous by critics&middot;made catalog records from different countries understandable and iden-
tifiable for computer entry or for use by catalogers who did not know the language in </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Organization of AACR2-2005 263
</p>
<p>which the record was written. AACR2 also included numerous examples and provided 
for three levels of detail in catalog records, furnishing the flexibility that small libraries 
and libraries catering to a nonscholarly audience wanted. Figure 13.1 (pages 250&ndash;51) 
  illustrates the differences. 
</p>
<p> Rule revision continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1997, a conference on 
cataloging principles similar to the 1961 Paris conference was convened in Toronto to 
help the Joint Steering Committee determine whether fundamental change was needed 
and, if so, what its nature and direction should be.4 Participants from ten nations rec-
ommended adding statements of the principles and functions of a catalog, reorganiz-
ing the rules to follow the ISBD model, considering greater internationalization of the 
rules, and wording rules plainly so that catalogers would not have to depend on expert 
guidance to apply them. A new cataloging code, titled  Resource Description and Access 
 (RDA), is in the final stages of release as an online publication in 2010.5 RDA&Ecirc;s rules are 
organized by descriptive element and include some differences from equivalent rules 
in AACR2, but they ask catalogers to follow similar processes in identifying materials 
(called &bdquo;resources&permil; by RDA) and they produce compatible descriptive data. Testing in 
the field continues and implementation is expected in 2011. The transition from AACR2 
to RDA should be smoother than the one from AACR1 to AACR2. This chapter explains 
current practice at this writing, with added comments about RDA. 
</p>
<p> ORGANIZATION OF AACR2-2005 
</p>
<p> AACR2-2005 is divided into two main sections. The first section covers descrip-
tion of materials; the second covers their retrieval. Rules for retrieval involve the choice 
and form of headings, called &bdquo;access points,&permil; based on the description. The chapters in 
the first section are numbered in the ordinary way, from 1 to 13. The chapters in the sec-
ond section begin with an introductory chapter numbered 20. Subsequent chapters are 
numbered consecutively from 21 to 26. 
</p>
<p> The AACR2-2005&Ecirc;s chapter 1 contains general rules applying to all materials, sup-
plements, items made up of several types of materials, and reproductions. Chapters 2 to 
11 each cover a group of materials, as shown in the following list. Chapter 12 covers ma-
terials issued continuously in parts, now called &bdquo;continuing resources,&permil; and chapter 13 cov-
ers descriptions for part of a material containing multiple parts, known as &bdquo;analysis&permil; or 
&bdquo;analytical&permil; cataloging. Catalogers speak of &bdquo;analytics&permil; in referring to title headings 
made for parts of materials being cataloged, such as each short story from a book of short 
stories or each symphony from a recording containing several symphonies. 
</p>
<p> The rules in AACR2-2005 bear mnemonic numbers that help catalogers navigate 
through the code: the first digit stands for the chapter number; the second stands for the 
element of description. After that, letters of the alphabet stand for subelements and ro-
man numerals for subdivisions of subelements. Rules relating to physical description 
(the fifth element of description) are numbered x.5, where x is the chapter (e.g., maps 
are covered in chapter 3 and videorecordings in chapter 7, so rules for map physical de-
scription are numbered 3.5, and similar rules for videos are numbered 7.5). Rule num-
bers are shorthand for individual rules. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>264 14&mdash;Description&mdash;Identifying Materials
</p>
<p> Under AACR2-2005, the first question to ask is, &bdquo;Is this material made up of one 
part or more than one?&permil; If there is one part, the next step is to determine which group it 
belongs to, according to the following choices: 
</p>
<p> Chapter 2: Books, pamphlets, and printed sheets 
 Chapter 3: Cartographic materials 
 Chapter 4: Manuscripts (including manuscript collections) 
 Chapter 5: Music 
 Chapter 6: Sound recordings 
 Chapter 7: Motion pictures and videorecordings 
 Chapter 8: Graphic materials 
 Chapter 9: Electronic resources 
 Chapter 10: Three-dimensional artefacts and realia 
 Chapter 11: Microforms 
 Chapter 12: Continuing resources 
 Chapter 13: Analysis 
</p>
<p> Chapter 1 is used to describe all materials, together with the chapter or chapters 
matching the media or publication group(s) to which a material belongs. To catalog an 
Oscar statue, for example, the rules in chapter 1 and chapter 10 are applied, because the 
statue is a three-dimensional material. To catalog a serially issued sound recording, vid-
eorecording, or electronic resource, three chapters are used: chapter 1; the chapter for 
the appropriate physical format; and chapter 12, the chapter for serials. RDA&Ecirc;s sections 
are not divided by physical format, but by cataloging entities and, within the sections for 
description, by attributes (descriptive elements). Variations in the way certain elements 
are recorded for different media are provided as appropriate. 
</p>
<p> If the material consists of more than one piece (except continuing resources), cat-
alogers must ask: &bdquo;Are all the pieces in one format?&permil; Examples of items in one format 
are multidisc sound recordings and CD-ROMs and multivolume books. If the answer is 
yes, proceed in the same way as described previously. Choose the appropriate chapter 
for the medium and begin. If the answer is no, ask: &bdquo;Is one of the pieces more important 
than the rest?&permil; If so, the item is cataloged using the chapter for that piece, called the  pre-
dominant  piece. All the other pieces are considered accompanying material, subordinate 
to that piece. If the answer is no, or if at least two pieces in different formats are equal 
in importance, the item is cataloged as a kit (or, if using the British interpretation of the 
rules, as a multimedia material), applying rule 1.10 (from chapter 1) and other chapters 
appropriate to the formats involved. 
</p>
<p> Judging importance and predominance is subjective. A useful rule of thumb to de-
termine whether one part of a material is predominant is to consider how the content of 
the item is conveyed. If each piece conveys the whole content, none is predominant 
and the item is a kit (or multimedia). If none of the pieces conveys the whole content 
and these pieces must be used together, there is no predominant piece and the item is a 
kit. But if one piece conveys the whole content and the others only add to it, that piece 
is predominant and the catalog record should be made for it alone, with the other pieces 
treated as accompanying materials. Figure 14.1 shows a book and sound recording set 
in which the book is considered predominant because it includes both the words and 
pictures, while the recording only includes the words. This item is cataloged as a book </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Organization of AACR2-2005 265
</p>
<p>with an accompanying sound recording. However, if this item is to be used to teach 
English to foreign speakers, it might be catalogued as a sound recording with accompa-
nying text. Figure 14.2 shows a sound cassette, response sheets, a post test, and a teach-
er&Ecirc;s guide set. None of the parts conveys the whole content. There are references in the 
sound cassette to the response sheet and vice versa; the post test needs both to be un-
derstood; and the teacher&Ecirc;s guide contains more information on the topic. This set is 
cataloged as a kit.

</p>
<p>  Games (including handheld games with computer chips), puzzles, and dioramas are 
exceptions to the definition of kits. Although usually comprising many pieces in different 
media, they are considered single units for cataloging purposes and follow chapter 10&Ecirc;s 
rules. 
</p>
<p> DESCRIPTIVE STRUCTURE AND DATA SOURCES 
</p>
<p> The ISBD structure for description has eight elements called  areas of description:  
</p>
<p> Area 1: Title and statement of responsibility 
 Area 2: Edition 
 Area 3: Material specific details (used for selected materials) 
 Area 4: Publication, distribution, etc. 
 Area 5: Physical description 
 Area 6: Series 
 Area 7: Notes 
 Area 8: Standard number and terms of availability 
</p>
<p> All the areas of description do not apply to every material being cataloged; for ex-
ample, when no edition information appears on material, the edition statement is left out 
of the description. This also is true of notes, most of which are optional. Material spe-
cific details are used only for serially issued materials, electronic resources, maps, and 
music. (RDA does not have an attribute called &bdquo;material specific details.&permil; It has an at-
tribute called &bdquo;numbering and dating of serials&permil; that contains the same kind of data for 
serials.) Many materials have no standard numbers. 
</p>
<p> Descriptive cataloging is like a puzzle with eight blank spaces, some or all of which 
are filled in according to information that appears on the material being cataloged. 
There may be more or less information than needed, or there may be competing sources 
of information. Rules in AACR2-2005 help catalogers handle these matters. The rules 
also help them choose the same information sources for cataloging purposes if more 
than one source is present. These rules are numbered with a zero (x.0) because they pre-
cede the areas of description, which are numbered one through eight (x.1&ndash;x.8). For ex-
ample, rule 7.0B covers information sources for motion pictures and videorecordings, 
rule 9.0B covers information sources for electronic resources, and so on. 
</p>
<p> At the start of each chapter, all recognized information sources for that media group 
are discussed. One is designated the  chief  source for that format; the rest are considered 
 prescribed  sources. Area 1 data must come from the chief source. It is the most impor-
tant piece of information, and people using the catalog record should be able to assume 
that it came from the chief source. If, for some reason, it does not&middot;for example, be-
cause a book does not have a title page or a visual image has no textual information, 
catalogers alert the user to this fact by putting information supplied from other sources 
into square brackets and listing the source of the information in the notes (area 7). The 
source of title note is especially important for serially issued continuing resources. The 
first issue is designated as the chief source, but if it is unavailable and another issue 
(the earliest available) is used instead, it must be noted. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ISBD Punctuation 269
</p>
<p> Each area of description has specific sources prescribed for it. Only area 1 must 
come from the chief source. Data for all the other areas may be taken from any of sev-
eral sources. Areas 5, 7, and 8 may come from  any  source, including personal knowl-
edge. Information from sources other than the prescribed sources is enclosed in square 
brackets to identify it. Notes are given to explain the sources of bracketed data, as in 
Figures 14.4 and 14.5. 
</p>
<p> The general principle followed by AACR2-2005 about information sources is to 
 prefer information from the material itself over information from more distant locations. 
 If a chapter covers a media group that requires hardware (e.g., viewers, projectors, re-
corders, computers) to see or hear the material itself, alternatives are provided for cat-
alogers who lack equipment. Some materials have multipart chief sources, such as a set 
of sound discs with labels pasted permanently on each disc or a videorecording with 
opening and closing credits screens. Practical guidelines for choosing among them are 
given. If an alternative to the preferred chief source for the format is chosen, it becomes 
the chief source, and information from it does not have to be bracketed, but the alter-
native must be explained in a note. 
</p>
<p> Another general principle followed by AACR2-2005 is to give bibliographic infor-
mation that is  readily available.  Few, if any, descriptive elements mandate giving infor-
mation available only from sources outside the material being cataloged that would 
require time-consuming research to obtain, for instance, counting numerous unnum-
bered pages or leaves in a book. When desired information is absent from the material 
being cataloged, it is either omitted (for example, an International Standard Book 
Number [ISBN]) or estimated (for example, a date of publication).

<p> IFLA&Ecirc;s experts devised a system of punctuation that distinguishes each element 
and subelement of a catalog record. This helps a cataloger who is unfamiliar with the 
language of a record to understand and use it. Unfortunately, when punctuation rules 
are read together at the beginning of each section, they seem very complicated. It is eas-
ier to put in the punctuation after the descriptive elements are assembled. Practice also 
helps a cataloger do this mechanical part of preparing catalog records faster. Figure 14.3 
illustrates the punctuation for a typical level 2 description. It can be imitated provided 
all the same data elements are present, but if any element or subelement is missing, the 
punctuation changes. Basic punctuations used are described in the sections that follow. 
Others may be found in AACR2-2005, which gives all the correct marks. 
</p>
<p> In the style of record shown in Figure 14.3, if an area of description begins a para-
graph, there is no designated punctuation that precedes it. If one area of description 
follows another in the same paragraph, a period-space-dash-space (. &ndash; ) precedes it. In 
North America, it has been customary to combine areas 1&ndash;4 in one paragraph, areas 
5 and 6 in a second, and each note in its own paragraph, but this is changing to a style in 
which each area of description has its own paragraph. Area 8 is also given a separate par-
agraph. In some countries, all elements of description appear in one paragraph, so it is 
useful to have the period-space-dash-space punctuation to define them. 
</p>
<p> Colons (:), semicolons (;), slashes (/), and commas (,) are used for several kinds of 
identification; an equals sign (=) denotes the same data in another language; and a </p>

<p>plus sign (+) identifies accompanying materials (area 5). In area 1, colons separate the 
title proper from the rest of the title; in area 4, they separate the place of publication 
from the name of the publisher; and in area 5, they separate the extent and specific ma-
terial designation from other physical details. Slashes identify statements of responsi-
bility in areas 1, 2, 6, and 7. Within statements of responsibility, commas usually separate 
names when the responsibilities are the same but are shared by more than one person or 
corporate body, and semicolons separate names when responsibilities differ. This pat-
tern is followed to identify multiple places and names of publishers and distributors, 
dates of publication, paging sequences, illustration types, and so on. Following are some 
examples: 
</p>
<p>  1. A book written by one person, illustrated by another, and edited by a 
third party, in which all the words given appear on the title page as shown 
below: 
</p>
<p>  / by James B. Smith ; illustrated by Gloria Green ; edited by Paul Robert 
Jones.

<p>272 14&mdash;Description&mdash;Identifying Materials
</p>
<p>  2. A book written by all three, where the word &bdquo;by&permil; appears on the title page, 
with the names listed underneath: 
</p>
<p>  / by James B. Smith, Gloria Green, Paul Robert Jones. 
</p>
<p>  3. A book written by two people and edited by a third, where the words &bdquo;by&permil; 
and &bdquo;and&permil; appear on the title page, but the words &bdquo;edited by&permil; do not appear 
and are supplied by the cataloger to explain Jones&Ecirc;s contribution to the 
book: 
</p>
<p>  / by James B. Smith and Gloria Green ; [edited by] Paul Robert Jones. 
</p>
<p> Whenever colons, semicolons, slashes, and equals signs are used in ISBD punctu-
ation, a space is put both before and after the mark. Commas and periods (called &bdquo;full 
stops&permil;) only have spaces after the marks, not before them, and parentheses and square 
brackets are spaced as they would be in any text. In most instances, it is the extra spaces 
that give librarians a clue that the punctuation is intended for identification of an element 
rather than for grammatical purposes. 
</p>
<p> Catalogers working in libraries with English-language collections need not worry 
much about punctuation errors; most patrons do not notice them, and they rarely affect 
retrieval. However, IFLA created ISBD punctuation to help catalog users understand 
the bibliographic records for materials in all languages and in nonroman scripts; there-
fore, libraries that contain foreign language materials should exercise more care in punc-
tuating their catalog records correctly. 
</p>
<p> The ISBD punctuation marks precede the elements they identify for the same rea-
son statements in a computer program tell the computer what kind of data it is going to 
receive before sending it (for example, online public access catalogs [OPACs] often in-
struct searchers to enter search statements such as &bdquo;ti=hamlet&permil; or &bdquo;au=shakespeare&permil; in 
which the requested title or author is preceded by an identifying word or phrase). If a 
descriptive element or subelement is missing, the ISBD punctuation that precedes it is 
also omitted. 
</p>
<p> CREATING THE DESCRIPTION 
</p>
<p> Area 1: Title and Statement of Responsibility 
</p>
<p> The first information in any description is the main title, called the  title proper , 
which is chosen from the chief source. Title words are transcribed  exactly as they appear 
 on the material as to their order and spelling, even if they are wrong. The reasoning be-
hind precise transcription is to ensure that a catalog record can be matched to the item 
it represents, especially when several versions of a title or similar-sounding titles exist. 
</p>
<p> The layout and typography of the words on the chief source of information are used 
to determine where a title proper begins and ends. AACR2-2005&Ecirc;s rules aid in deter-
mining titles proper in special cases that are encountered frequently, for example, if 
two separate versions of Charles Darwin&Ecirc;s voyage appear in the two ways shown in 
Figures 14.4 and 14.5, rules in Chapter 1 direct the cataloger to transcribe them as given. 
When there is no rule to determine what should be done, follow your instincts and 
decide. </p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Creating the Description 275
</p>
<p> Capitalization and punctuation of titles proper are not transcribed as they appear 
on the chief source. Capitalization of all parts of the description follows standard rules 
contained in AACR2-2005&Ecirc;s Appendix A. For English-language titles, usually only the 
first word and subsequent proper nouns are capitalized. Different rules govern capi-
talization for other languages. Punctuation marks that are the same as those used in 
ISBD punctuation are not transcribed as they appear, because they might be confused 
with ISBD punctuation. Instead, catalogers insert appropriate ISBD punctuation and ig-
nore what is given on the material. 
</p>
<p> Marks of omission, space-three periods-space ( . . . ), are used to indicate words 
found on the title page that are omitted from the bibliographic record. In Figure 14.3 
the three periods that are part of the title on the title page have been changed to a dash in 
the bibliographic record to avoid misunderstanding. 
</p>
<p> Sometimes an item is published in two (or more) languages and has titles in both 
of them. Both are considered part of the title proper. A bilingual title does not always 
mean the material is a bilingual work. In Figure 14.6, despite the presence of a bilingual 
title on the title page, the book is not written in two languages. (  is pronounced 
&bdquo;Nunavut&permil; and translates into English as &bdquo;Our land.&permil;)  . Many cataloging departments 
do not have the syllabic typeface to list the Inuktitut title as required for second-level 
cataloging, so first-level enriched cataloging&middot;defined as more data than required by 
level 1, but not as much as required by level 2&middot;may be a simple, practical solution 
for materials bearing titles in nonroman alphabets.   
</p>
<p> After the title proper, the rules offer an option to give a  general material designat-
ion  (gmd) that alerts the catalog user to the item&Ecirc;s physical format. The AACR2-2005 
has two lists of permissible general material designations (gmds), one for use by British 
catalogers, the other for catalogers in Australia, Canada, and the United States. Gmds are 
optional. In libraries consisting mostly of books, the gmd for books,  text,  usually is omit-
ted and only gmds for other formats are used. If books are not a library&Ecirc;s primary ma-
terial, catalogers may decide to use  text  along with all the others. Libraries that use gmds 
put them immediately after the title proper. 
</p>
<p> Following the gmd (or following the title proper if a gmd is not used) the rest of 
the title appears; this is called  other title information  in AACR2-2005. (This part of area 1 
is not required for level 1 descriptions.) Figure 14.6 presents an example of other title 
information given after title proper. Lengthy other title information can be given in the 
notes, as shown in Figure 14.7.   
</p>
<p> Some books have  alternate titles,  which are almost always preceded by the word 
&bdquo;or&permil;. Alternate titles are considered to be part of the title proper. For example, in Fig-
ure 14.8, &bdquo;The confessional of the black penitents&permil; is an alternate title and &bdquo;a romance&permil; 
is other title information. 
</p>
<p> The last part of area 1 is the  statement of responsibility.  Here, the name(s) of the 
author(s), composer(s), artist(s), programmer(s), or other people or groups responsible 
for the overall content of the item are given,  provided  the names appear &bdquo;prominently&permil; 
on the item being cataloged. Some catalogers interpret &bdquo;prominent&permil; as appearing on the 
chief source or outer covering; others include only those names that appear in large print 
or that are identified as being important contributors to the work. Some catalogers 
choose not to give the names of translators or writers of forewords, no matter how they 
are displayed. If no names appear on the item, this element is omitted. </p>

</p>
<p> Names that are important to the library but are not prominently displayed on the 
material being cataloged can be given in area 7 (the note area) to form the basis for 
headings. Any name used as an access point must be given somewhere in the catalog re-
cord. If the name has not appeared in areas 1 through 6, a note is given to provide the 
basis for the access point. Some computerized catalogs have the capacity to search 
all fields of the record, so putting a name in the note field provides access even if a 
separate access point is not made. In Figure 14.9, A. J. Casson, an important Cana-
dian painter, is the book&Ecirc;s designer. Usually book designers are not given in the catalog 
record, but an art school might want to provide access to all Casson&Ecirc;s work in its 
collection. 
</p>
<p> (Level 1 descriptions give only the first statement of responsibility and that only if 
it differs from the item&Ecirc;s main heading, or if there is no personal name main entry 
heading.) 
</p>
<p> Area 2: Edition Statement 
</p>
<p> If an edition is stated on the prescribed sources of information for this area, it is 
transcribed as it appears in the second area of description. The words of the statement 
must be given in the same order as they appear, since &bdquo;second revised edition&permil; is not the

<p>same as &bdquo;revised second edition&permil; or &bdquo;second edition, revised.&permil; A revised edition is not 
the same as an updated edition, a second edition, or an expanded edition. Words in an 
edition statement should be abbreviated if any of the words being transcribed are listed 
in AACR2-2005&Ecirc;s Appendix B (words) or C (numbers). Thus, the several examples in this 
paragraph would be recorded in a catalog record as follows: </p>

<p> Area 3: Material Specific Details 
</p>
<p> Three kinds of materials require use of area 3: cartographic materials, printed mu-
sic, and serial continuing resources in all formats. Each type of material has its own 
information for this area, hence the name  material specific.  RDA includes rules for 
serial-related and map-related details as separate descriptive elements. 
</p>
<p> Cartographic items use area 3 to record the scale and, when found on the item, the 
projection and, optionally, a statement of coordinates and equinox. Figure 14.10 shows 
this information for a map. While a statement of scale is required for area 3, given as a 
representative fraction expressed as a ratio (1: )6, the other technical specifications are 
optional and need not be given unless the information is readily available from the item. 
(Level 1 cataloging only requires giving the scale.)   
</p>
<p>     Printed music often contains a statement of the kind of musical presentation it 
represents, such as &bdquo;piano-vocal score&permil; or &bdquo;miniature score.&permil; Statements found on the 
chief source of the manifestation being cataloged are recorded here, as shown in Fig-
ure 14.11.  </p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>282 14&mdash;Description&mdash;Identifying Materials
</p>
<p>Figure 14.11
</p>
<p> Serially issued continuing resources use area 3 to record the numbering and dating 
of the first issue. If the first issue is not available and the material is being cataloged 
from a subsequent issue, area 3 is left blank and the numbering and dating of the earliest 
available issue is given in a note (see Figure 14.12). Numbering and dating in area 3 
are followed by a hyphen and spaces to indicate that the area is unfinished. If the pub-
lisher stops issuing the title, data for the final issue can be added in the spaces, as in 
the following examples:   
</p>
<p>  The first issue of a magazine says &bdquo;Issue No. 1&permil;  
</p>
<p> Area 3: Issue no. 1- . 
</p>
<p>  The last issue of the same magazine says &bdquo;Issue No. 101&permil;  
</p>
<p> Area 3: Issue no. 1&ndash;101. 
</p>
<p>  The first screen of an electronic periodical says &bdquo;Volume 1, number 1, 2001&permil;

</p>
<p> The rules assume that the original numbering style will not change over the life 
of a serial, but occasionally it does. Sometimes a publisher begins by numbering 
issues sequentially, but, later on, prefers to supply both volume and issue numbers. 
This happened with  Library Hi-Tech,  which displays both its old and new numbering 
systems (see Figure 14.13).   
</p>
<p> Nonbook titles issued serially may require two kinds of information in two sepa-
rate area 3 statements. One statement will be for the numbering and dating; one state-
ment will give the relevant medium-related data. 
</p>
<p> Area 3 is required for level 1 cataloging, but optional subelements are omitted. 
</p>
<p> Area 4: Publication, Distribution, etc. 
</p>
<p> For published materials, area 4 gives information about the publishers or other 
issuing agencies. (For cataloging purposes, all remote-access electronic resources, 
including all Internet materials, are considered published.) Publishers are responsible for 
issuing books and other printed materials, although distributors may also issue them. 
Entities issuing motion pictures, videorecordings, and other recorded materials are gen-
erally known as distributors or releasing agencies. Sometimes two publishers or both a </p>

<p>publisher and distributor (or other entity) are named. Occasionally, the place, name, and 
year of the material&Ecirc;s manufacture is given when publication and distribution informa-
tion is not readily available or in addition to it. 
</p>
<p> No matter how many entities are named, three pieces of information are given for 
each: the city in which it is located, its name, and the year it issued the material (see </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Creating the Description 285
</p>
<p>Figure 14.14
</p>
<p>Figure 14.14). This information is to be given as succinctly as possible, provided it 
identifies the entity uniquely. (Level 1 records only require information about the 
first-named publisher.) 
</p>
<p> Unpublished materials have no entities responsible for their issue, so no issuers&Ecirc; 
locations and names are given here. Unpublished objects made by people do have dates 
when they were created, and those dates are given here (see Figure 14.15). Area 4 is 
omitted entirely for naturally occurring objects that have not been packaged for com-
mercial distribution, such as a shell or geode.   
</p>
<p> For published serials, the date on the first issue is given in area 4 but is left open by 
adding a hyphen and spaces following the year with the intention of filling in a closing 
date should the serial cease publication. When an issue after the first is used as the basis 
of cataloging, no date is given in area 4. (Level 1 records for serials require only the first 
publisher&Ecirc;s name and date, with the date left open.) 
</p>
<p> If a publisher has several locations, the first-named city is always given, but, if an-
other is listed more prominently, it also is given. If neither the first-named city nor a 
more prominently named city is located in the cataloger&Ecirc;s home country, but a city in the 
home country is also listed, it, too, is given. In Figure 14.16, four places of publication 
are listed on the title page. The first of these&middot;Melbourne&middot;must be given in the cat-
alog record. The second&middot;Oakland&middot;is given in a catalog record for U.S. libraries </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>286 14&mdash;Description&mdash;Identifying Materials
</p>
<p>Figure 14.14&mdash;Continued
</p>
<p>because it is the first-named place in the home country, but Oakland is not given in a Ca-
nadian record.   
</p>
<p> Production of nonbook items is not synonymous with the publication of books. For 
films and videos, production means creation, and belongs in area 1. Nonbook items may 
be released instead of published. The releasing agent and/or distributor is named in 
area 4, and is equivalent to a book&Ecirc;s publisher, as in the following examples: 
</p>
<p> [S.l.] : Dupuis Fr&egrave;res ; distributed in North America by Langlois, [200-?].
</p>
<p>[Brisbane?] : Boolarong Publications in association with Queensland Aboriginal 
Creations, [19--] 
</p>
<p> If published material being cataloged does not list places or names of publishers or 
distributors, catalogers can substitute the abbreviations [S.l.] and [s.n.] in square brack-
ets, meaning  sine loco  (without a place) and  sine nomine  (without a name) for the miss-
ing information. RDA eliminates these and other abbreviations, preferring to use words 
catalog users understand more easily. 
</p>
<p> The publication or distribution date&middot;the third element of information included 
in this area&middot;must always be given, with two exceptions: dates are not given to naturally </p>

<p>occurring objects and serials for which the date of the first issue is unknown. Various 
kinds of dates are found on materials, including publication (or distribution) dates, copy-
right dates, printing dates, production dates, manufacture dates, and more. The pre-
ferred date for area 4 is  publication  or  distribution,  not copyright, printing, production, </p>

<p>or manufacture dates. If there are several dates, all publication or distribution dates, 
the one that matches the edition statement in area 2 should be chosen to give in area 4. 
</p>
<p> When no publication or distribution date appears on the item, the next best choice 
for area 4 is the copyright date. Nonbook materials may be copyrighted long before 
they are released, so some care should be exercised in selecting old copyright dates for 
new distributions, for example, a 1990s video production of a 1940s film. It is better to 
make an educated guess about when the video was released than to use a copyright date 
from the 1940s for a video that could not have been made or distributed during that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Creating the Description 289
</p>
<p>decade. The guessed date may be given in one of the following ways, depending on the 
degree of certainty that it is correct: 
</p>
<p> [2009]&middot;the year is not in doubt, but the source is not one of those prescribed 
 [2009?]&middot;the year is in doubt; the cataloger guesses it is 2009 
 [200&ndash;]&middot;the exact year is in doubt, but the cataloger knows it is in the 2000s 
 [200&ndash;?]&middot;the exact year is in doubt; the cataloger guesses it is in the 2000s, but is not 
</p>
<p>certain about it 
</p>
<p> A copyright date is identified by a &bdquo;c&permil; or, in the case of some sound recordings, a 
&bdquo;p&permil; (&bdquo;phonogram&permil;) immediately preceding the year. The copyright letter and year should 
be transcribed from the material. If copyright and publication dates differ, both may be 
given in this area, publication date first, or, the copyright date may be given in a note. 
</p>
<p> In the absence of either a publication/distribution date or a copyright date, the date 
of manufacture may be given in area 4, but it must be identified as such (for example, 
&bdquo;1959 printing&permil;). When no dates appear on the item, the cataloger must guess, based on 
whatever information is available. The cataloger may look up the item in a reference work, 
consider the technology, or glean clues from the item itself. As shown earlier, AACR2-
2005 suggests many ways to express an approximate date, depending on the catalog-
er&Ecirc;s degree of certainty and the time span. 6  
</p>
<p> Figure 14.17 illustrates how research and common sense help approximate a date 
of publication for a book lacking dates of any kind on it. The preface is dated 1932 and 
the book&Ecirc;s verso says it is a wartime book. To what war does it refer? World War II is a 
logical assumption. Reference sources reveal that C. H. Best, a well-known scientist 
who helped discover insulin, was active then. The book was printed in the United States, 
which entered the war in December 1941, making 1942&ndash;1945 the likely range of years 
in which it was published.   
</p>
<p> Area 5: Physical Description 
</p>
<p> Physical description includes counting the number of physical pieces in which ma-
terial being cataloged appears, called the  extent of item,  and naming the kind of pieces, 
called the  specific material designation  (smd). A physical description is not given to 
electronic resources accessed online unless the online version of the document has page 
numbers. RDA devotes its section 3 to describing carriers, that is, the physical aspects of 
the resource, as well as facsimiles, reproductions, and multicarrier resources. 
</p>
<p> For some recordings, the duration of the material when played back or projected is 
given in parentheses after the smd, as shown in Figure 14.18. Other parts of the phys-
ical description include other physical details; dimensions; and accompanying materi-
als, if there are any. Accompanying materials are added pieces of material physically 
separate from what is being cataloged, such as an optical disc issued as an adjunct to 
a textbook or a separate libretto tucked into the jewel case of an opera recording. Ex-
tent, physical details, and dimensions vary by physical form, but accompanying mate-
rials are treated the same way for all materials. (Level 1 records require giving only the 
extent.)    </p>

<p>Creating the Description 291
</p>
<p> The smd is the &bdquo;carrier&permil; of the intellectual or artistic content of something that is 
cataloged. Carriers come in many forms, the most familiar of which are books. Because 
books have long appeared solely as printed codexes (that is, pages protected by covers), 
the codex is rarely thought of as a carrier, but if libraries collected texts on papyrus 
scrolls and cuneiform blocks, the idea of the codex as a text carrier would be clear. 
</p>
<p> For books, extent is given as the number of pages, leaves (pages with text on only 
one side), or volumes. The general rule is to give the last numbered page (or leaf) as the 
total; or, if a book consists of several sequences of numbers, the last numbered page in 
each sequence. Plates in a book are a special case. By definition, plates are separate pages 
bound in with a text after it is prepared. They are considered a separate part of the ex-
tent and are counted and listed after the regular pagination, shown in Figure 14.3 on 
page 270.   
</p>
<p> Electronic resources contained in or on physical carriers, sound recordings, and 
videorecordings are described in terms of the number of discs, cartridges, cassettes,

like motion pictures, may be described as reels of film, but they can also be fiches and 
other microformats. It is not always possible to anticipate development of new physical 
formats, so rules in several chapters of AACR2-2005 allow catalogers to create appro-
priate smds whenever necessary. 
</p>
<p> Other physical details vary by physical format. For books, the most obvious added 
detail is illustrations. The abbreviation &bdquo;ill.&permil; is given whenever photographs, drawings, 
or other visual images appear in printed materials and their reproductions. Tables, illus-
trated title pages, and minor illustrations are not considered &bdquo;ill.&permil; Optionally, specific 
types of illustrations such as maps, diagrams, genealogies, and so on, can be named in 
addition to &bdquo;ill.&permil;7 This option has been adopted for the figures and examples in this book. 
</p>
<p> Typical physical descriptions for selected formats of materials covered by AACR2-
2005 are listed in Figure 14.19. Notice that magnetic disks (the computer floppy disk) 
are spelled with a &bdquo;k,&permil; whereas optical discs are spelled with a &bdquo;c.&permil;   
</p>
<p> Area 6: Series 
</p>
<p> AACR2-2005 defines a series as a group of separate items that contain both indi-
vidual titles for each item and a common or collective title applying to the group as a 
whole.8 If an item belongs to a series, the name of the series is given in this area. (Level 1 
records omit the area entirely.) The main title (or, title proper) of a series is transcribed 
exactly as it appears on the item, even if the cataloger intends to make a heading for the 
series that differs from the transcription. In addition, if the item being cataloged has a 
number within the series, it is recorded. If it is important for identification, a state-
ment of responsibility associated with a series may be given. Otherwise, statements of 
responsibility are omitted. When an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) for 
the series is on the item, it is included also (see Figure 14.20). Some items regularly bear 
both ISBNs and ISSNs, so catalogers can treat them either as serials or monographs.

</p>
<p> Area 7: Notes 
</p>
<p> Notes generally are optional at all bibliographic levels, although there are some 
important exceptions. These exceptions are clearly stated in rules for other areas of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>294 14&mdash;Description&mdash;Identifying Materials
</p>
<p>description that instruct catalogers to make specific notes, for example, giving the source 
of the title proper if it does not come from the chief source. &bdquo;Title supplied by cataloger&permil; 
and &bdquo;Title from cover&permil; explain many bracketed titles proper. For electronic resources, 
notes explaining the source of the title proper and the system requirements are man-
dated at all levels. 
</p>
<p> The rules of AACR2-2005 prescribe the order in which notes should appear. They 
follow the order of descriptive elements, with notes relating to titles given before notes 
relating to editions, notes relating to editions before notes relating to publication, dis-
tribution, and so on. AACR2-2005 makes it possible for an important note to be put first, 
out of the usual order. Such changes must be approved by the Joint Steering Commit-
tee to become part of AACR2; for example, the frequency of continuing resources is 
given as the first note. Sometimes, catalogers in an individual nation change the order 
of notes to conform to policies and practices of its national library. 
</p>
<p> Two kinds of notes can be made: formal or informal. Informal notes are brief sen-
tences, such as &bdquo;Title from cover&permil; or &bdquo;Includes index.&permil; Formal notes are formatted in a 
particular way beginning with an introductory word such as &bdquo;Summary&permil; or &bdquo;Contents&permil; 
followed by a colon and the data, sometimes in a prescribed style (see the Contents note 
in Figure 14.18). Notes may be combined if it seems appropriate. Among the most fa-
miliar combined notes are the bibliography and index notes for books, which use the 
following standard language:  Includes bibliographical references and index.  Examples

<p>Figure 14.20&mdash;Continued
</p>
<p>of notes are included in many places in this book. To find a particular one, readers should 
consult the index to figures and examples. 
</p>
<p> Notes that are particularly important to make include the following: 
</p>
<p>  1.  Source of the title proper:  If the preferred chief source for bibliographic 
information is not available, whatever alternative to it that is chosen to 
serve as chief source is noted. This note is mandated for all electronic re-
sources, even when the preferred chief source is used, and in some in-
stances it is also used for other types of materials. 
</p>
<p>  2.  Physical description:  Books and other formats can benefit from the added 
information this note provides, for example, informing searchers a book 
is chiefly photographs, describing the shape of an object, or the colors of 
a multicolored visual image. 
</p>
<p>  3.  System requirements:  For videorecordings, this is the place to include in-
formation about needed hardware. Two different kinds of system require-
ments notes are mandated for electronic resources. Resources physically </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>296 14&mdash;Description&mdash;Identifying Materials
</p>
<p>held in a library are given a systems requirements note. Electronic re-
sources accessed from remote sources, which have no physical existence 
in local libraries, are given a note that describes how users gain access to 
them, called a &bdquo;mode of access&permil; note. This note includes the material&Ecirc;s 
electronic address or Uniform Resource Locator (URL), and the date the 
item was viewed for cataloging purposes should be added as the final note 
in the catalog record. 
</p>
<p>  4.  Contents notes:  These notes should be made when an item contains more 
than one work, such as a book containing two or more novels or a sound 
recording containing two or more symphonies. This enables catalogers to 
make added entries for the analytic title for the individual works. Limits 
on the number of titles to include in a contents note are hard to set. Be-
tween the extremes of very few and too many, catalogers must use judg-
ment. The decision should rest on an estimate of how often people want 
only one of the works, not the whole collection, and whether they can find 
it another way. 
</p>
<p>  5.  Summaries:  Summaries should always be made for materials unavailable 
for browsing or that have very little eye-readable information to help a 
browser decide if they are what he wants, unless the rest of the catalog re-
cord describes them clearly. In recent years, increasing numbers of search-
ers must rely on catalog records to decide if an item is what they want, so 
summary notes have gained greater importance, even for materials that 
can be browsed on-site. For many years, the Library of Congress has given 
summary notes in bibliographic records for children&Ecirc;s materials (see 
chapter 17.) 
</p>
<p>  6.  Details of the library&Ecirc;s copy:  This is the place in the catalog record to note 
torn pages, autographs, unique features, or other details present only in the 
cataloging library&Ecirc;s copy of a material. 
</p>
<p>  7.  Numbers on the item:  Numbers  other than  the ISBN or ISSN that appear 
on an item, such as Library of Congress Control Numbers or Universal 
Product Code numbers are given in this note. (ISBNs and ISSNs are given 
in area 8, see the next section.) 
</p>
<p> Special notes for continuing resources include the frequency of issue, which 
AACR2-2005 mandates is given as the first note. Another note gives details of the re-
lationships of the title being cataloged with other titles, such as earlier and later titles, 
mergers and splits, absorptions, supplements, and so forth. 
</p>
<p> Area 8: Standard Numbers and Terms of Availability 
</p>
<p> The eighth and last area of description is optional and is used for a material&Ecirc;s stan-
dard number, defined solely as the ISBN (for monographs) or ISSN (for serially issued 
continuing resources). Numbers other than ISBN or ISSN are given in area 7 (see the 
previous section). Area 8 is also the place to give the purchase price, rental fee, or other 
terms of availability for material. If no standard number appears on the material being 
cataloged, area 8 is left blank or only terms of availability are recorded, if desired. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Summary 297
</p>
<p> Terms of availability is frequently interpreted as the retail price printed on materials. 
In practice, however, libraries rarely pay the retail price and prices change over time. 
In recent years, replacements often cost more than the original material; thus, prices in 
a catalog record have dubious accuracy. Local policy may be to omit this information 
even if it is readily available. 
</p>
<p> For serially issued continuing resources, the key-title, an identifier of the Interna-
tional Serials Data System (ISDS), is entered here. ISDS is an international program of 
serials identification similar to ISSN sponsored by the United Nations Education, Sci-
entific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); ISSN is sponsored by IFLA. 
</p>
<p> Data describing book bindings and paper, if the paper was treated to reduce acid-
ity, may be added in parentheses following the number; for example, ISBN 0-8389-
7809-6 (pbk.) or ISBN 0-8389-0624-9 (alk. paper). 
</p>
<p> RULE INTERPRETATIONS 
</p>
<p> National cataloging agencies that implement AACR&Ecirc;s rules&middot;generally national li-
braries&middot;interpret the rules and make decisions on its options that become standard for 
their countries, because catalogers in local libraries look to them for direction. In the 
United States, that agency is LC; in Canada, it is LAC. Their rule interpretations and de-
cisions are issued as policy directives called rule interpretations or &bdquo;RIs&permil; for their cat-
alogers. RIs are made available to outside agencies through online announcements and 
publications such as LC&Ecirc;s  Cataloging Service Bulletin, Cataloger&Ecirc;s Desktop,  and the 
LAC Web site (http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/6/18/s18-204-e.html). Rule inter-
pretations are not as authoritative as the rules themselves, but they carry the weight of 
the largest and most important originators of catalog records in their countries. More 
importantly, national bibliographic networks conform to them and ask their members 
to do so, making them standard practice. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> Building a bibliographic description is not as easy a task as it seems at first glance, 
because publishers of library materials are extremely inventive when it comes to 
identifying their products. The proliferation of sophisticated material formats and 
information-delivery systems complicates how catalogers find and prepare biblio-
graphic information completely enough that one material is not mistaken for another. 
AACR, incorporating the ISBD standard sponsored by IFLA, asks catalogers to seek in-
formation for catalog records from the same sources, divide it into the same eight areas 
of description, and arrange and present the information in the same order. In this way, 
bibliographic data is understood and can be used or shared around the world. RDA 
makes some changes in these processes, but includes the same elements in approxi-
mately the same order, elaborating on some and applying relaxed application of others. 
The result is very similar bibliographic descriptions for the resources being cataloged. 
</p>
<p> In cataloging, all materials have prescribed sources of information, one of which 
is designated the chief source. Catalog records for all materials begin with title 
statements (descriptive area 1) and then provide edition data (descriptive area 2), if </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>298 14&mdash;Description&mdash;Identifying Materials
</p>
<p>applicable. Following the edition data, a few material formats add data specific to their 
type (descriptive area 3). All the other material formats follow edition data with in-
formation about publication and distribution (descriptive area 4). Each material format 
has its own set of rules for describing the physical form of the material (descriptive 
area 5). One format that lacks physical attributes&middot;remote electronic resources&middot;omits 
the description of physical form, describing instead in notes (descriptive area 7) how 
one gains access to the materials. Following the physical description, information about 
series to which materials belong is given (descriptive area 6), followed by notes that ex-
plain features of materials that have not yet been adequately described (descriptive 
area 7). Finally, ISBNs or ISSNs of materials are given, along with their terms of avail-
ability (descriptive area 8). 
</p>
<p> The next step in the cataloging process is to select headings that can be used as 
search terms for retrieving specific materials from the catalog. Because the headings 
are also known as access points, the process of selecting and formulating them is called 
&bdquo;access.&permil; It is covered in the next chapter. 
</p>

  Access Points&mdash;
</p>
<p>Retrieving the Record 
</p>
<p> A name, term, code, etc., under which a bibliographic record may be searched 
and identified. 
</p>
<p> &middot; Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules,  2nd ed., 
2002 revision, 2005 update 
</p>
<p> Creating headings for the description is the next step in the cataloging process. 
Rules for headings appear in Part II of the  Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules,  second 
edition, 2002 revision, 2005 update (AACR2-2005). (RDA&Ecirc;s section 5 covers this as-
pect of cataloging.) Catalogers refer to headings by a variety of terms, among them  ac-
cess points, entries, headings, search terms,  and  authorities.  Because AACR2-2005 
prefers the term  access point,  it is used in this chapter. The chapter covers only  descrip-
tive  access points&middot;names of parties responsible for the materials and titles by which 
materials are known or to which they are related. Access points related to the subject 
content of materials are not included here. They are discussed in chapters 16&ndash;18. 
</p>
<p> Following AACR2-2005&Ecirc;s chapter 20, which introduces Part II, Chapter 21 pro-
vides rules that instruct the cataloger how to select elements from the description for 
access points. When searched in the catalog, inputting the chosen names, titles, or 
combined names and titles retrieves the record. Chapters 22 through 25 provide rules 
for putting the chosen headings into proper form. Chapter 22 explains how to con-
struct headings for personal names; chapter 23 for geographic names; chapter 24 for 
entities made up of named groups of people acting together, known as  corporate bod-
ies 1 and chapter 25 for conventional titles assigned to works called  uniform titles.  
(Dates and control numbers are not mentioned as access points in AACR2, because 
searching under such numeric elements as well as physical formats is a feature en-
abled by computers, not a result of applying the rules.) 
</p>
<p> The final chapter, chapter 26, describes references that help catalog users find 
material even if they use search terms other than the ones AACR2-2005 prefers. These </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>302 15&mdash;Access Points&mdash;Retrieving the Record 
</p>
<p>include  see, see also, name-title,  and  explanatory  references, and how to make them 
for names of persons, places, corporate bodies, and uniform titles. The chapter also 
discusses references to added entries (secondary access points) for series and serials 
and the use of references in place of added entries. 
</p>
<p> MAIN AND ADDED ENTRIES 
</p>
<p> Descriptive access points are divided into two kinds:  main entries  and  added 
entries.  The difference between them is that the first and most important access point 
chosen is designated the &bdquo;main&permil; entry; all others are added entries. There are at least 
two reasons for designating main and added entries. Some libraries maintain single-
entry, staff-access-only, official catalogs that are more efficient to search than their 
multiple-entry public catalogs. The single-entry catalogs are usually main-entry list-
ings. Second, shelf marks&middot;the additions to classification numbers that form call 
numbers&middot;are derived from main entries. Without them, new rules for creating shelf 
marks would be needed. 
</p>
<p> In the Anglo-American cataloging tradition, creators are generally considered 
the primary identifying features of their works; thus, the rules of AACR2-2005 usu-
ally, although not always, instruct catalogers to make creators the main entries of 
materials being cataloged.   Titles are an alternative choice for main entries. Only one 
creator or one title can be a main entry, however. There are no &bdquo;joint&permil; main entries. If 
an item being cataloged has two coequal creators, one is chosen as main entry and the 
other is automatically an added entry. Similarly, if material bears more than one title 
(e.g., parallel titles, subtitles, abbreviated titles), and catalogers determine it should 
have a title main entry, only one is chosen as main entry. The other title can be an 
added entry. 
</p>
<p> Authorship (that is, creation) of materials is considered the most important start-
ing point for access. In the distant past, it was assumed that only people could create 
content and be considered authors, but in modern times, it is not unusual for groups of 
people working together to produce content. Are these groups equivalent to people? 
Earlier cataloging rules said yes to this question, provided the groups were named in 
the materials they created. Such groups are called  corporate bodies.  Corporate bodies 
for cataloging purposes should not be confused with the legal entities called cor-
porations, although corporations are also considered corporate bodies. As long as a 
group of people work together and have a name, they qualify as a corporate body. 
</p>
<p> When a corporate body causes materials to be created, the materials are said to 
&bdquo;emanate&permil; from it, even if individuals actually do the writing, composing, program-
ming, compiling, painting, or whatever creative activities are involved in producing 
the materials. A debate arose in cataloging circles over whether corporate bodies 
were the same as personal authors. The matter has been decided in different ways 
over time; however, AACR2, in all its versions, limits the authorship role of corpo-
rate bodies, considering them equal to individuals in the creation of only a few types 
of materials. 
</p>
<p> Determination of the main entry for material being cataloged is usually a matter of 
identifying the creator, if there is only one, or the principal creator, if there is more than 
one. When no such creator is found, the title is the fallback choice for the main entry. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Selecting the Main Entry 303
</p>
<p> SELECTING THE MAIN ENTRY 
</p>
<p> The first step in selecting a main entry is to eliminate the possibility that mate-
rial can be assigned a corporate-body main entry. The cataloger must ask if material 
emanates from a corporate body and, if so, if it is one of the types of content given a 
corporate-body main entry. Items emanating from corporate bodies do not automati-
cally get corporate-body main entries. First, the corporate body must be named the 
&bdquo;author&permil; on the chief source of information (see Figure 15.1). Second, rule 21.1B22 
limits assignment of corporate body main entry to six specific types of documents:   
</p>
<p> &bull; Documents of an administrative nature dealing with the corporate body 
itself, such as the catalog of a library or an information center, or the mem-
bership directory of an association. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Specified kinds of legal, governmental, and religious documents, primarily 
laws, court rules, regulations, treaties, and similar materials. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Documents that represent the collective thought of the body, such as the 
minutes of meetings, reports of a committee, annual reports, and so on. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Material representing the collective effort of a voyage, expedition, or a con-
ference meeting the definition of a corporate body when the event is named 
in the item. Events that have no official names are not defined as corporate

<p> &bull; Sound recordings, films, or videos for which the responsible corporate 
body does more than just perform. Catalogers must judge when a perform-
ing group does something that qualifies as  more than mere performance, 
 that is, something qualifying as  creation.  The cataloger asks to what extent 
new content&middot;such as music, words, movement&middot;is present, something that 
is typical of improvisation. In classical music, improvisation is unusual; in 
popular or jazz music, the opposite is true. Thus, popular performing groups 
often earn main entries. The same is true with some videos and films. This 
rule applies to performers who act together as a group and have a name, 
such as the rock group Abba. It does not apply to individuals who happen 
to be on the same program for a recording date or a concert.

<p> &bull; A cartographic representation where the corporate body is responsible for 
more than publication. The National Geographic Society is an example. It 
sponsors expeditions to explore the territories it maps, hires and directs 
cartographers, and performs other functions as well. Therefore, the society 
is often chosen as main entry for the maps it publishes.

<p>Selection Decision Tree 305
</p>
<p> If an item emanates from a corporate body but does not fit into any of these cat-
egories, it is ineligible and is not given a corporate body main entry. Instead, either a 
personal creator or a title is selected as main entry, depending on what appears on the 
chief source of information. 
</p>
<p> According to AACR2-2005, once the possibility of corporate body main entry 
has been ruled out, the cataloger should name as the main entry &bdquo;the personal author, 
the principal personal author, or the probable personal author.&permil;3 Figures 15.2 and 15.3 
illustrate instances when a personal author is chosen as the main entry.   
</p>
<p> The final option, title main entry, is applied when there is no known creator; 
when there are more than three creators sharing equal amounts of the same responsi-
bility for the item, if their contributions are the same; when the item emanates from a 
corporate body but is not eligible for corporate body main entry and has no personal 
author; or when the material is a work is produced under editorial direction. Figures 15.4 
through 15.6 illustrate materials given title main entries.    
</p>
<p> SELECTION DECISION TREE 
</p>
<p> The following questions and caveats form a useful decision tree for determining 
the main entry: 
</p>
<p>  1. Does the item emanate from a corporate body? Yes? Go to question 2. 
No? Proceed to question 8. (If in doubt, assume that the answer is no and 
proceed to question 8.) 
</p>
<p>  2. Is the item an administrative work dealing with the body itself? Yes? As-
sign a corporate body main entry. (If more than one corporate body is

<p>involved, follow the rules for multiple personal authors in caveat 2.) No? 
Go to question 3. 
</p>
<p>  3. Is the item one of the designated types of works in rule 21.1B2b? Yes? 
Assign a corporate body main entry. (If more than one corporate body is 
involved, follow the rules for multiple personal authors in caveat 2.) No? 
Go to question 4. 
</p>
<p>  4. Does the item record the collective thought of the body? Yes? Assign a 
corporate body main entry. (If more than one corporate body is involved, 
follow the rules for multiple personal authors in caveat 2.) No? Go to 
question 5. 
</p>
<p>  5. Does the item record the collective activity of an event? Yes? Assign a 
corporate body main entry. (If more than one corporate body is involved, 
follow the rules for multiple personal authors in caveat 2.) No? Go to 
question 6. 
</p>
<p>  6. Does the item result from the collective activity of a performing group 
as a whole that goes beyond mere performance? Yes? Assign a corporate 
body main entry. (If more than one corporate body is involved in the per-
forming group, follow the rules for multiple personal authors in caveat 2.) 
No? Go to question 7. </p>

<p>  7. Is the item cartographic and does the responsibility of the corporate body 
go beyond publication or distribution? Yes? Assign a corporate body 
main entry. (If more than one corporate body is involved, follow the 
rules for multiple personal authors in caveat 2.) No? Go to question 8. 
</p>
<p>  8. Is the work by one or more persons? Yes? Go to question 9. No? Assign 
a title main entry. 
</p>
<p>  9. Is one person the sole creator or principal creator of the work? Yes? As-
sign that person as the main entry. No? Go to question 10. 
</p>
<p>  10. Are two or three persons equally responsible for the creation of the 
work? Yes? Assign the first-named person as the main entry and give 
added entries for the rest. No? Go to question 11. 
</p>
<p>  11. Are more than three persons equally responsible for the creation of the 
work? Assign a title main entry. </p>

</p>
<p> Caveat 1: Questions 10 and 11 assume shared responsibility. Consult the special 
rules for mixed responsibility when there are different types of contributions. 
</p>
<p> Caveat 2: Apply a rule of thumb called the Rule of Three when more than one 
person or body is involved in either shared or mixed contributions. The Rule of Three 
says: If the number of persons exceeds three and none are predominant, assign title 
main entry. 
</p>
<p> Caveat 3: Editors are not creators of the works they edit. An edited work with 
contributions from one or more authors is considered the collective work of those au-
thors, whether they are persons, corporate bodies, or both. But bibliography compil-
ers are creators, even if the term applied to the compiler on the title page is &bdquo;editor.&permil; 
For example  The Book of Quotes    is entered under the compiler in Figure 15.7.  
</p>
<p> ADDED ENTRIES 
</p>
<p> Once the main entry is chosen, it is time to consider choosing more access points, 
called &bdquo;added entries,&permil; for the names of other people and bodies or other titles associ-
ated with the material. Some added entries are mandated by the rules for main entry, </p>

</p>
<p>reason for the added entry must be evident from the rest of the description. Notes are 
made about variant titles, titles of parts, and/or secondary statements of responsibil-
ity, so they may be selected as headings. Evidence is not necessary to document main 
entries. When an item is erroneously attributed on the chief source, but the cataloger 
knows who truly created it, the rules prescribe giving the main entry to its true creator 
(or its probable creator, if there is doubt). 
</p>
<p> Added entries are made routinely for the following: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Joint creators 
 &bull; People or bodies making other creative contributions, if they are named 
</p>
<p>prominently on the item 
 &bull; Titles proper 
 &bull; Uniform titles not chosen as main entry 
 &bull; Title variations found on the item 
 &bull; Analytical titles 
 &bull; Series titles. 
</p>
<p> A new type of added entry is an electronic resource&Ecirc;s Uniform Resource Locator 
(URL). Many guidelines for cataloging Internet resources recommend adding it, pref-
erably as a direct link.

<p>Name and Title Authorities 315
</p>
<p> NAME AND TITLE AUTHORITIES 
</p>
<p> What is a name authority or a title authority? It is a record of the way names and 
titles are formulated for use as access points in the catalog. Once they are chosen, the 
rules of AACR2-2005 provide numerous rules for putting them into authorized form. 
That form is expected to be the only one used for each name or title. This results in all 
the materials by a person or corporate body or bearing a unique title being gathered in 
one place in the catalog, even if the materials themselves display the names and titles 
in different forms. 
</p>
<p> Personal Names 
</p>
<p> Two principles underlie the rules in AACR2-2005 for creating the authorized 
form for a personal name access point: (1) the form should be the one most familiar to 
searchers, and, (2) in most instances, only one form is used for an individual, ensuring 
that all the person&Ecirc;s works are brought together in one place in the catalog. 
</p>
<p> The first principle seems logical, but is the reverse of AACR1&Ecirc;s principle, which 
required using the fullest form of a person&Ecirc;s real name. AACR2-2005 follows Charles 
Cutter&Ecirc;s idea that catalog headings should match what searchers are most likely to 
expect. It instructs catalogers to use the most commonly known form of a name and 
sometimes permits more than one form to be used simultaneously. AACR2-2005 also 
permits pseudonyms, initials, nicknames, and appellations to be authorized if they are 
how an individual is most commonly known. Following are authorized headings that 
illustrate these instances. 
</p>
<p> &bull; The most commonly known name form consists of initials: 
</p>
<p>   &bull;  IBM Academic Information Systems  [full name: International Busi-
ness Machines Corporation Academic Information Systems] 
</p>
<p>   &bull;  Unesco  [full name: United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cul-
tural Organization] 
</p>
<p> &bull; The most commonly known name form consists of initials (a qualifier that 
is part of the authorized form is added to the initials giving the full name): 
</p>
<p>   &bull;  H.D. (Hilda Doolittle), 1886&ndash;1961  
   &bull;  Eliot, T.S. (Thomas Stearns), 1888&ndash;1965  
</p>
<p> &bull; The most commonly known name form consists of a pseudonym: 
</p>
<p>   &bull;  Orwell, George, 1903&ndash;1950  [real name: Eric Arthur Blair] 
   &bull;  Twain, Mark, 1835&ndash;1910  [real name: Samuel Langhorne Clemens] 
</p>
<p> &bull; The most commonly known name form consists of a nickname: 
</p>
<p>   &bull;  Carter, Jimmy, 1924&ndash;  [real name: James Earl Carter; this name form is 
used for his publications written as a private person, not as president 
of the United States] 
</p>
<p>   &bull;  Gillespie, Dizzy  [real name: John Birks Gillespie] </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>316 15&mdash;Access Points&mdash;Retrieving the Record 
</p>
<p> Research is required to determine the most common name form. Catalogers are 
instructed to examine all the published works of a person or corporate body, count-
ing the number of times each form appears on published materials and selecting the 
one that appears most often to be the authorized form. Some authors deliberately use 
more than one name on their publications, because they wish to have different types 
of materials associated with each name form. Catalogers call this establishing &bdquo;mul-
tiple bibliographic identities.&permil; When this happens, AACR2-2005 allows catalogers to 
authorize the form associated with each type of material or, in the case of contempo-
rary authors, whatever name that appears on each publication. Cross-references are 
made for unauthorized name forms ( see  references) and multiple name forms ( see 
also  references). 
</p>
<p> Most creators use only one name form. The form authorized when an individual&Ecirc;s 
first publication is cataloged is usually the only access point needed for that person. 
National libraries and libraries that participate in national cooperative programs pre-
pare files of the name forms they authorize for their catalogs, called &bdquo;authority files.&permil; 
The forms they authorize are called &bdquo;name authorities.&permil; 
</p>
<p> Title access points are a little different. Titles proper do not need authorization, 
because, by definition, they are transcribed exactly as they appear on published ma-
terials. Series titles, however, can differ from one publication to another, and uniform 
titles are created when the same content is published bearing different titles proper. 
These titles require an authorized form. AACR2-2005 has rules for establishing title 
access points, called &bdquo;title authorities.&permil; 
</p>
<p> Catalogers can consult national library authority files and copy the name forms 
they authorize, thus avoiding the costly research of doing the work themselves. Dif-
ferent national libraries do not always select the same form for a person (see the 
cataloging-in-publication [CIP] information in Figure 15.9 for Jean Weihs). The 
Library of Congress (LC) and Library and Archives Canada (LAC) each have a formal 
policy for establishing the names of corporate bodies, but this agreement does not 
cover personal names.    
</p>
<p> AACR2-2005 rule 22.17 directs catalogers to add a person&Ecirc;s dates (e.g., birth, 
death) to a heading if the heading is otherwise identical to another. It also allows the 
optional use of dates even when there is no need to distinguish people with the same 
names. Dates have been added to personal names in this book when they are found in 
the CIP record and for names that have long been established that way, for example, 
Bernard Shaw and Charles Darwin. 
</p>
<p> Corporate Bodies 
</p>
<p> The same principles that apply to personal names apply also to corporate body 
names. A single form is established for a corporate body, but when a corporate body 
changes its name, it may also become a new body. Changes are more likely to be sub-
stantive, resulting in the presence of more than one access point for a corporate body 
that has evolved over time. 
</p>
<p> Using the most commonly known form of name as the authoritative form holds 
for corporate bodies, but the application differs. The name used by the group on its 
stationery, official documents, and publications is the one selected. Problems occur </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Name and Title Authorities 317
</p>
<p>when a body updates its image by changing its logo. Rules define substantive changes 
to a corporate body name to eliminate multiple headings for a body undergoing 
changes of this kind, which are merely cosmetic. Sometimes corporate bodies an-
nounce an intention to change names, for example, Trenton State College to College 
of New Jersey.4 Multiple names are appropriate in that case. 
</p>
<p> When a corporate body is part of a larger body, catalogers must decide how to 
formulate an authorized name, either alone (called &bdquo;direct&permil; entry) or as a unit under the 
larger body (called &bdquo;subordinate&permil; entry). It is more difficult when multiple layers of 
bureaucracy separate the parent body and the subordinate unit; for example, the Com-
mittee on Cataloging: Description and Access (CC:DA)&middot;the committee that governs 
</p>

<p>318 15&mdash;Access Points&mdash;Retrieving the Record 
</p>
<p>Figure 15.9&mdash;Continued
</p>
<p>AACR2-2005 in the United States&middot;has two intervening layers of hierarchy between 
its parent entity, the American Library Association (ALA), and the unit itself: 
</p>
<p> 1. ALA (parent body) 
</p>
<p> 2.  Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services (ALCTS; 
subunit of the parent body, a division) 
 3.  Cataloging and Classification Section (subunit of the division, a 
</p>
<p>section) 
 4. CC:DA (subunit of the section, a committee) 
</p>
<p> When the name of a corporate body implies that it is a subordinate unit&middot;clearly 
the case with committees, divisions, and sections&middot;the name of the higher body is 
always included. In the case of a multilevel hierarchy, AACR2-2005 instructs catalog-
ers to include the name of the lowest unit of hierarchy that can stand alone, provided 
it is a unique identification. For CC:DA, the only higher body that needs to be added 
is ALCTS. The authoritative name form for CC:DA is the following; 
</p>
<p>  Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services. Committee on Cataloging: 
Description and Access.  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Name and Title Authorities 319
</p>
<p>   &bdquo;Cataloging and Classification Section&permil; is not used because it is subordinate and no 
other section of ALCTS has a committee by this name; therefore, the name is unique. 
</p>
<p> The Cataloging and Classification Section of ALCTS also has a Policy and Re-
search Committee, but its authoritative heading would not be    Association for Library 
Collections &amp; Technical Services. Policy and Research Committee,  because another 
section within ALCTS, the Serials Section, also has a committee by that name. Each 
of the two committees must be identified uniquely. The authoritative form of the Cat-
aloging and Classification Section&Ecirc;s Policy and Research Committee is  Association 
for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services. Cataloging and Classification Section. 
Policy and Research Committee. 5 
</p>
<p> The best way to help searchers find what they are looking for is to make cross-
references to any name form they might reasonably seek and to program online public 
access catalogs (OPACs) to match word combinations in corporate body headings 
to retrieve all sets that include the requested terms. Thousands of corporate bodies 
are listed in LC&Ecirc;s  Name Authority File  and LAC&Ecirc;s  Canadiana Authorities,  which are 
available for catalogers to adopt instead of establishing those names from scratch. 
Organizations at state and local levels sometimes provide lists of local corporate body 
authorities as a public service.6 
</p>
<p> Geographic Names 
</p>
<p> Geographic names are used in some access points in the catalog. It is easy to 
imagine the confusion that would result if different forms of name were used for 
the same geographic entity. For example, should Britain, Great Britain, or United 
Kingdom be used as the authoritative access point for the territory inhabited by our 
colleagues across the Atlantic? For places located in non&ndash;English-speaking countries, 
does the cataloger authorize the English or the vernacular name form (for example, 
Florence or Firenze, Milan or Milano)? What does the cataloger do about nonroman 
languages, such as Arabic, Chinese, and Russian? 
</p>
<p> AACR2-2005&Ecirc;s Chapter 23 instructs catalogers to choose English name forms 
for places if such forms are in general use. When no English form is in general use, 
the vernacular form in the official language of the country is authorized. For example, 
Leghorn, the English name for Livorno, is not generally used in the English-speaking 
world; therefore, it is not chosen to be the authorized name of that Italian city. Instead, 
 Livorno,  the Italian (vernacular) name is chosen as the authorized form. 
</p>
<p> Place names change (for example, Russia to the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
publics and back to Russia). In these instances, catalogers are instructed to use as 
many name forms as are required to satisfy the rules in Chapter 24 for government 
names, additions to corporate and conference names, and other corporate body name 
access points. Because this means a single place can have more than one authorized 
name in the catalog, cross-references are used to clarify the relationships. 
</p>
<p> Sometimes a name is used for more than one place (for example, Cairo, which 
could identify the capital of Egypt or the city in Illinois). Additions to the name serve 
to distinguish them. Additions differ for some countries, with one group comprising 
  Australia, Canada, Malaysia, the U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia, and the United States. Lo-
calities within these places are qualified by adding the name of the state, province, 
territory, and so on. The countries of the British Isles&middot;England, Republic of Ireland, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>320 15&mdash;Access Points&mdash;Retrieving the Record 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales as well as the Isle of Man and the Channel 
Islands&middot;are a second group, for which local place names7 are augmented by the 
addition of a country or island name. This practice applies to other countries of the 
world as well. 
</p>
<p> Special rules cover places that require still more specific identification or spe-
cial kinds of identification, for example, localities with identical headings even after 
additions are made (two places named Saint Anthony, Minnesota, one in Hennepin 
County and the other in Stearns County), communities within cities (Hyde Park in 
London, England, or Chicago, Illinois), or names of political jurisdictions. These rules 
and their interpretations can be consulted if material being cataloged requires those 
kinds of access points to be established. Like personal and corporate body names, 
geographic names are included in national and international authority files. 
</p>
<p> Uniform Titles 
</p>
<p> Most works are published once and bear one title. Their titles proper are the only 
title access points they need. Some works, however, are issued many times over the 
years and may not be given the same title proper by their publishers. This is common 
among world classics ( Alice in Wonderland  and  Alice&Ecirc;s Adventures in Wonderland   ), 
holy scriptures (different editions of Bibles, different spellings of Koran or Quran), 
translations, and so on. Works given different titles proper by their publishers would 
not be filed in the same place in the catalog, even though their content is the same. To 
solve the problem and gather them, such works are given a single agreed-upon title by 
catalogers, called a  uniform title,  under which they are filed together. Uniform titles 
serve another function: They are used to distinguish identical titles, such as musical 
works called &bdquo;Symphony&permil; or serials called &bdquo;Journal.&permil; 
</p>
<p> The most widely used uniform titles are described in AACR2-2005&Ecirc;s chapter 25, 
along with rules for creating and assigning uniform titles to works catalogers believe 
need one. Uniform titles are common among seven types of works: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Classics 
 &bull; Music 
 &bull; Religious works 
 &bull; Laws 
 &bull; Works that are issued both complete and in parts, such as  Mother Goose  
 &bull; Works issued in multiple physical formats, such as  Gone With the Wind  
 &bull; Translations, if more than one version is in a library collection 
</p>
<p> When material being cataloged has a personal or corporate body author, the uni-
form title is displayed as an added entry in square brackets on a line inserted between 
the main entry and the title proper. If the material has no personal or corporate body 
author, the uniform title is given as the main entry and displayed in the usual position 
for main entries. Uniform titles are also found in added entries. Figures 15.10&ndash;15.14 
demonstrate the use of uniform titles.  
</p>
<p> Uniform titles need not be made for every work that exists in multiple versions 
unless several are represented in a catalog or are likely to be added to it. Some, how-</p>

<p>Summary 327
</p>
<p>ever, such as the Bible, require the addition of a uniform title to meet the requirements 
of cataloging networks, even though a library owns only one version. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> Charles Cutter&Ecirc;s second object of the catalog&middot;helping searchers select a desired 
work from among the works of an author held in a library&Ecirc;s collection or a desired 
edition of a work held by the library in multiple editions&middot;requires that the works 
of an author and the editions of a work be gathered together in the catalog. This is 
deemed the collocation object. To accomplish it, authors&Ecirc; names and titles of works 
cannot appear in multiple forms, even if that is how they appear on publications. It is 
the opposite of the first object of the catalog. Transcribing names and titles faithfully, 
which is what the rules of description require, helps accomplish that&middot;namely, reveal-
ing what the library has by an author or if it holds a title, which is called the finding 
list function. On the other hand, collocating names and titles that appear in different 
form on publications requires selecting one form to serve as the gathering point for 
each name and each title. 
</p>
<p> Performing the work of selecting name and title forms is known as &bdquo;authority 
work,&permil; because the resulting selections are authorized for use as access points in the 
catalog. It involves examining all the possible forms and selecting the most commonly 
known form, the one preferred by AACR2-2005, because that is the form searchers are 
most likely to request. The rules allow for multiple name forms to be used in instances 
when creators have gone out of their way to create separate bibliographic identities 
for different types of content, sometimes using a real name and a pseudonym or mul-
tiple pseudonyms. Rejected forms generally become cross-references leading to the 
authorized form, and when multiple forms are permitted, cross-references link them. 
</p>
<p> Records of authorized access points, cross-references, and the sources of infor-
mation used to establish them are called  authority files.  National libraries and other 
large libraries doing a great deal of original cataloging maintain these files, but the 
work is costly and time-consuming. When faced with a new name, catalogers in North 
American libraries can benefit from the work of their national libraries by consult-
ing LC&Ecirc;s  Name Authority File  or the LAC&Ecirc;s  Canadiana Authorities  for any of the

<p>16  Subject Analysis 
</p>
<p> When our stock of information has been systematically arranged, and is 
available for use . . . it has gradually developed into the nucleus of an  intel-
ligence department,  covering all the subjects and their ramifications within 
the scope of our activity. It has become a powerful base on the strength of 
which successful operations may be undertaken. But let there be no doubt 
about it: it is an instrument, we are its masters. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Julius O. Kaiser,  Systematic Indexing  
(emphasis in the original) 
</p>
<p> Thus far we have covered bibliographic description and access. Bibliographic 
description enables catalogers to prepare a kind of super citation that identifies each 
resource in a library&Ecirc;s collection so completely that it cannot be mistaken for any 
other resource. Access covers the process of selecting and formulating the names of 
people and groups associated with a resource as well as its title(s), which become ac-
cess points by which the item can be retrieved. To use these descriptive access points, 
however, library users must know the name of the creator or the title of the material 
they want. What happens if they do not know either of these? Users often want to find 
a kind of material&middot;something entertaining to take on a beach vacation, an exercise 
video, science experiments for children, dance music for a party, information about 
cataracts&middot;without knowing exactly which item in the collection fits the need. They 
are looking for specific content, not for creators or titles. In cataloging, the represen-
tation of content is called  subject analysis.  Catalogers represent the content of materi-
als in two ways: they assign  subject headings  that users can search in the catalog and 
 call numbers  that group materials with like content on the shelves. Representing the 
subject content of materials is sometimes referred to as providing  intellectual access 
 to materials. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>332 16&mdash;Subject Analysis
</p>
<p> The assignment of subject headings, which is a kind of indexing, is called  subject 
cataloging.  No single code of rules governs it, unlike description and access, which 
follow the  Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules,  second edition, 2002 revision, 2005 
update (AACR2-2005) and will soon follow the rules of  Resource Description and 
Access . Similarly, no single code governs the assignment of  classification numbers,  
the category codes that are the basis of call numbers. Instead, catalogers adopt one of 
the available tools for subject cataloging and classification, and follow accepted prac-
tices in applying them. 
</p>
<p> Subject cataloging and classification both involve two steps: determining the 
subject content of the materials being cataloged and expressing it. Determining sub-
ject content is the same for both, but expressing it depends on the particular tools se-
lected for the task. General principles of subject analysis are discussed in this chapter. 
Specific tools for subject cataloging, known as  subject authorities , are discussed in 
chapter 17, and tools for classification in chapter 18. 
</p>
<p> DETERMINING SUBJECT MATTER 
</p>
<p> Representing the content of the materials being cataloged first requires catalog-
ers to determine what the content covers&middot;in other words, what the subject matter is. 
Describing how to go about doing it, however, is not so easy. Each cataloger brings 
his or her personal background, knowledge, and experience to the task of deciding 
what something is about and whether the approach taken to the material is relevant. 
Depending on how much a cataloger knows about a subject area, he or she might rec-
ognize different aspects of content in a particular item. This affects the determination 
of subject matter made for that item. 
</p>
<p> Typically, information derived directly from the items being cataloged helps re-
veal their contents, whether or not catalogers have special knowledge of those sub-
ject areas. Sometimes catalogers are assigned to do subject cataloging for a set of 
subjects, whether or not they know anything about them. If they are responsible for 
cataloging materials in unfamiliar subjects, they must study them enough to be able to 
handle them. In research libraries, catalogers may be expert in selected subject areas 
and/or languages. In most libraries and with most materials, however, the catalogers 
are expected only to be generally conversant with subjects. 
</p>
<p> Where can clues to the subject matter of materials be found? Four places are 
likely sources: 
</p>
<p>  1. Titles, including alternative titles and subtitles 
  2. Tables of contents and their equivalents, such as menus and site maps 
  3. Indexes 
  4. Introductions, prefaces, &bdquo;about&permil; files, and their equivalents 
</p>
<p> Catalogers cannot read every word of a book or Web site, or view every inch of a 
video to ascertain its subject. Instead, material is read, heard, or viewed technically, 
which means a few key sources are examined carefully and subject matter, scope, 
and coverage are determined from them. Subtitles often reveal subject content better 
than main titles, which may be chosen for dramatic appeal. Chapter or segment titles 
add greater detail to information contained in titles, and suggest scope and coverage. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Enumeration versus Faceting 333
</p>
<p>Introductions, prefaces, about files, and the like can describe an author&Ecirc;s intended 
audience, important inclusions or exclusions, and other subject-related information. 
Back of the book indexes, Web site index terms, and similar internal finding aids offer 
evidence of the range of subtopics covered in an item. A quick scan of the rest of the 
item can answer questions that remain after a technical examination is completed. 
</p>
<p> If it is necessary to go beyond the material itself for information, descriptions of 
materials in publishers&Ecirc; or producers&Ecirc; catalogs and reviews of materials can provide 
helpful detail. These sources can augment catalogers&Ecirc; ideas or confirm conclusions 
about subject matter gleaned from the item itself when technical reading fails to re-
veal it clearly or completely. However, information taken from book jackets, album 
covers, and promotional blurbs is not always reliable and should be used cautiously. 
These are marketing tools aimed at enticing buyers and may not be strictly accurate. 
</p>
<p> An item&Ecirc;s content can also be affected by the approach taken to the material. An 
item that gives an overview of the whole field of chemistry and an item that is solely a 
dictionary of terminology used in the field of chemistry are both about chemistry, but 
the dictionary approach merits recognition. It is different from an introductory over-
view of the subject. General coverage of the subject is assumed when catalogers say 
a book is about chemistry or a video is about exercise. If the approach is not general, 
catalogers usually identify it by specifying its form. A chemistry dictionary is about 
chemistry, but its form is that of a dictionary. An exercise video is about exercise, but 
its approach may be that of a lecture on the subject (general coverage) or an activity 
session in which the viewer is expected to participate (directed exercise), and the 
physical form of the item is an audiovisual presentation recorded on videotape. Thus, 
catalogers speak of subject and form, where form may be defined as a genre (e.g., 
dictionaries, biographies, bibliographies, essays), a physical format, or a specific type 
of approach to the subject. 
</p>
<p> Subject matter may be limited to one location or time period, and geographical 
and chronological specifications are often added to reflect those limitations. If a Web 
site about divorce is limited to Canada, catalogers want to express that explicitly, 
so that a searcher seeking information about divorce in Mexico or the United States 
would not think the item answers the person&Ecirc;s need. Subject headings and classifica-
tion sources provide for both geographic and chronological approaches to subjects. 
</p>
<p> ENUMERATION VERSUS FACETING 
</p>
<p> Subject headings and classification categories share other features, among them 
the way the headings or categories are formulated and displayed. Two ways of for-
mulating and displaying subject headings are to establish complete headings and 
categories and list them&middot;called  enumeration &middot;or to establish the parts from which 
headings and categories might be formed and allow the catalogers or the searchers to 
put the parts together as needed&middot;called  faceting.  Because a faceted subject-heading 
system or classification requires synthesizing a heading or category from the parts, 
faceted systems are also called &bdquo;synthetic.&permil; When using an enumerative system, cata-
logers find a desired subject heading or classification category in the listing. When 
using a faceted or synthetic system, catalogers combine available parts to create the 
desired subject heading or classification category. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>334 16&mdash;Subject Analysis
</p>
<p> Another way of looking at enumeration versus faceting is to ask if a subject 
heading or classification source provides prebuilt combinations of complex headings 
or categories or if catalogers are expected to do the work of building them. When the 
combinations are prepared in advance of use, the source is enumerative. These kinds 
of sources are also called &bdquo;precoordinated.&permil; When the combinations are not prepared 
in advance of use, the source is faceted, also called &bdquo;postcoordinated.&permil; Examples of 
enumerative systems include the  Sears List of Subject Headings ,  Library of Con-
gress Subject Headings  (LCSH), Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), and Library 
of Congress Classification (LCC). Faceted or synthetic systems include the keywords 
used in searching computer databases or the Internet. A keyword, although it might be 
used as a subject by itself, is likely to be combined with other keywords to represent 
complex subjects, thus behaving like a facet (or part) of the whole. 
</p>
<p> Searching a keyword such as &bdquo;restaurants&permil; in a huge database such as the Internet 
could retrieve tens of thousands of hits, but combining &bdquo;restaurants&permil; and &bdquo;Boston&permil; and 
&bdquo;reviews&permil; could whittle them down to a smaller group of reviews for Boston restau-
rants. Postcoordination permits the parts&middot;location (Boston), approach (reviews), and 
topic (restaurants)&middot;to be entered in any order to retrieve materials that contain them 
all. A precoordinated system would have a subject heading or classification category 
for reviews of food served in Boston restaurants that could look like one of the fol-
lowing (the list is not exhaustive&middot;more combinations are possible): 
</p>
<p> BOSTON&middot;RESTAURANTS&middot;REVIEWS 
 RESTAURANTS&middot;BOSTON&middot;REVIEWS 
 RESTAURANT REVIEWS&middot;BOSTON 
 REVIEWS, RESTAURANT&middot;BOSTON 
</p>
<p> A precoordinated classification scheme might subordinate location and approach 
under the topic, restaurants, as in the second heading in the previous list. It might com-
bine the topic and approach directly (restaurant reviews) or indirectly (reviews, 
restaurant) as in the third and fourth headings. Or, it might subordinate reviews of 
restaurants under the location, Boston, as in the first heading. What it would not do is 
allow more than one of those choices. 
</p>
<p> To succeed in searching a precoordinated index or classification, the cataloger 
needs to know the principle focus of the subject or where the topic is located in rela-
tion to other topics. The Dewey Decimal Classification appends an alphabetic index in 
which subject terms containing the word &bdquo;water,&permil; such as &bdquo;waterwheels&permil; and &bdquo;water 
spirits,&permil; are brought together for consultative purposes. In this way, classifiers can see 
that resources covering waterwheels are close to resources covering other mechanical 
devices in the call numbers for technology (621+) while those covering water spirits 
are near fairy tale creatures in call numbers for folklore (398+). 
</p>
<p> SUBJECT AUTHORITIES: SUBJECT HEADING VOCABULARIES 
</p>
<p> Subject cataloging is a type of indexing 1  done by catalogers for the materials 
they catalog. Indexing specialists do the same kind of work on the texts of individual 
books, for which they prepare back-of-the-book indexes. Indexers also work on journal </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Principles of Subject Cataloging 335
</p>
<p>articles, book chapters, research reports, Web sites, and similar documents, preparing 
ongoing periodical indexes, such as  Readers&Ecirc; Guide to Periodical Literature.  Like 
library catalogs, periodical indexes also list authors&Ecirc; names and article titles. 
</p>
<p> The same principles apply to all types of indexing, including subject cataloging, 
and the same search skills are needed to retrieve indexed material from catalogs, peri-
odical indexes, and back-of-the-book indexes. The main differences among the types 
of indexing are the nature of the material being indexed and the degree of specificity 
of the indexing. Back-of-the-book indexers work on individual documents and pre-
pare very specific indexes consisting of up to hundreds or even thousands of terms for 
one document. Periodical indexers work on articles appearing in magazines and jour-
nals (and article equivalents, such as book chapters), and they do broader indexing, 
consisting of a number of terms per article. Subject catalogers work on monographs 
and whole title runs, and they do very broad indexing, assigning a handful of terms to 
describe the contents of the documents at a summary level. 
</p>
<p> Words used to represent the subjects of materials listed in the catalog can be taken 
from different sources, depending on individual library policy. Standard terms come 
from published lists accepted by the library community for use as sources for subject 
headings in the catalog, called  subject authorities.  Subject authorities are much like 
the name authorities discussed in chapter 15. Because subject authorities effectively 
control which words can and cannot be used as subject headings, they are also known 
as  controlled vocabularies.  Libraries usually choose one standard subject authority. 
In recent years, however, some libraries have chosen to combine more than one sub-
ject authority in their catalogs, using a general subject authority for most materials 
and specialized authorities for a few disciplines, such as art or medicine. 
</p>
<p> An entirely different type of word list can be derived from keywords, for ex-
ample, by compiling lists of important title words. (Articles such as &bdquo;a,&permil; &bdquo;an,&permil; and 
&bdquo;the,&permil; and other words that do not reflect subject matter, are ignored.) Because no 
one controls the words authors choose for their titles, such word lists are referred to 
as  uncontrolled vocabularies.  Computer-based catalogs are frequently programmed 
to search title words. Individual words may also be searched when they are part of 
authorized subject headings. Thus, people speak of title keywords and subject key-
words, which are not the same thing. Enabling both types of searching accomplishes 
two things simultaneously: subject headings from the controlled vocabulary provide 
precision in identifying relevant material; subject headings from the uncontrolled vo-
cabulary increase the possibility that searchers&Ecirc; words match authors&Ecirc; title words, thus 
increasing the number of potential hits in answer to a search request. To maximize the 
possibility of finding desired materials, both types of subject terms can be used. Cata-
logers provide the authorized headings, while computer systems are programmed to 
find and retrieve materials containing the uncontrolled keywords. 
</p>
<p> PRINCIPLES OF SUBJECT CATALOGING 
</p>
<p> Two kinds of principles affect subject cataloging: those underlying the selection 
of words and phrases authorized as subject headings and those underlying the assign-
ment of subject headings to materials. According to Cutter&Ecirc;s &bdquo;Objects,&permil; the catalog 
should serve as a finding list for subjects and should bring together all items on a </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>336 16&mdash;Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>subject, just as it does for authors, titles, and editions. But because subject headings 
are words, language issues arise, such as words with several possible meanings, words 
whose meanings change over time, and so on. The word &bdquo;bridges,&permil; for example, could 
refer to dental bridges, structures that span bodies of water, bony ridges on people&Ecirc;s 
noses, parts of stringed instruments, or the control rooms of ships. An example of 
evolving meaning is the word &bdquo;lobby.&permil; Once it was interpreted as a noun meaning an 
entrance foyer of a building such as a hotel; now, it can also be interpreted as a verb 
that means to &bdquo;try to influence legislation.&permil; Other linguistic issues include but are not 
limited to whether to use singular or plural nouns, which verb forms to use, whether 
to invert modified nouns or keep them in natural (direct) order, and how to formulate 
complex topics. 
</p>
<p> Similarly, decisions about the assignment of subject headings involve questions 
such as how much material on a subject must be present in a document to justify as-
signing a subject heading to it and in what order topical, geographic, and chrono-
logical elements in a complex subject should appear. While the assignment of subject 
headings is, essentially, a subjective activity, agreement on general principles can 
help make it less idiosyncratic. 
</p>
<p> Subject catalogs can be arranged alphabetically or in classified, or subject, order. 
Generally, catalogs that use verbal subject headings are arranged alphabetically, 
though they could be arranged in classified order. Classified catalogs are usually ar-
ranged according to classification numbers. (The library shelflist is an example of a 
classified catalog.) North Americans are familiar with alphabetical subject indexes be-
cause this is how their library catalogs usually are arranged. Classified catalogs may 
contain the same terms, but arranged in  subject  order, with the broadest topics given 
first, followed by related but narrower topics in a logical organization for each major 
subject division. 
</p>
<p> In a classified subject catalog, the entire catalog might be divided into a few 
main classes, for example, HUMANITIES, NATURAL SCIENCES, and SOCIAL 
SCIENCES. HUMANITIES is the broadest term in the first section and would be 
followed by individual humanities disciplines: ART, LITERATURE, MUSIC, RELI-
GION, and so forth. In turn, MUSIC would be followed by still smaller topics, such as 
VOCAL MUSIC and INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC. It is easy to see the contrast with 
an alphabetical, or dictionary, catalog such as those in most media centers and public 
libraries. There, the same topics would be arranged as follows: ART, HUMANITIES, 
INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC, LITERATURE, MUSIC, NATURAL SCIENCES, RELI-
GION, SOCIAL SCIENCES, and VOCAL MUSIC. HUMANITIES follows ART, 
which seems odd, and MUSIC follows INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC but precedes 
VOCAL MUSIC, which would seem peculiar to users of classified subject catalogs. 
A hybrid catalog, partly classified and partly alphabetical, was also devised, called 
an  alphabetico-classified  catalog. In this catalog, principal headings are in classified 
order, but headings at each level of hierarchy are arranged alphabetically (see 
Figure 16.1).   
</p>
<p> In the column on the left in Figure 16.1, levels of hierarchy are distinguished by 
indentations. Other ways of showing hierarchical levels include thumb tabs and guide 
cards if indentations are inconvenient to display, and they need not be identified at all. 
A knowledgeable searcher knows that MUSIC falls under HUMANITIES and that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Principles of Subject Cataloging 337
</p>
<p>INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC and VOCAL MUSIC are at a narrower level than MUSIC 
in general. 
</p>
<p> Though the arrangements of terms can vary, the choice of terms and their assign-
ment flow from one set of principles: 
</p>
<p>  1.  Synonyms cannot be used simultaneously as headings in a catalog.  Li-
brarians rely on subject authorities to avoid using two headings that mean 
the same thing, for example, AUTOMOBILES versus CARS. If both terms 
are likely to be searched, both may be listed, but only one is authorized for 
use; the other will refer to the term actually used. 
</p>
<p>  2 . Words chosen as subject headings have clear and precise meanings.  
Subject authorities avoid words with more than one meaning, or, when such 
words must be used, something is added that indicates the intended mean-
ing, for example, BARS (DRINKING ESTABLISHMENTS), BARS 
(ENGINEERING), BARS (FURNITURE), and BARS (GEOMOR-
PHOLOGY). 
</p>
<p>  3.  Terms assigned as subject headings match the specificity of the topics 
they represent.  A term should not be broader or narrower (that is, more 
specific) than the topic it represents. For example, if CALCULATORS 
is a heading, it should be defined to exclude computers, which, although 
they also manipulate numbers, are a different type of machine. In  Li-
brary of Congress Subject Headings,  the scope note at CALCULA-
TORS says: &bdquo;Here are entered works on present-day calculators as well 
as on calculators and mechanical computers of pre-1945 vintage. Works 
on modern electronic computers first developed after 1945 are entered 
under Computers.&permil; 2  
</p>
<p>  4.  Each subject heading term is discrete with respect to all others.  Prob-
lems occur when overlaps in meaning occur between subject headings, 
particularly when they are all at the same level of hierarchy, such as 
</p>
<p>Figure 16.1. Subject-heading arrangements.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>338 16&mdash;Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>BIOLOGY, BIOCHEMISTRY, and CHEMISTRY. Where does BIOL-
OGY end and BIOCHEMISTRY begin? Where does BIOCHEMISTRY 
end and CHEMISTRY begin? If all are used in the same catalog, each 
must cover discrete territory. 
</p>
<p> David Judson Haykin, a respected head of LC&Ecirc;s subject division in the 1950s, 
codified the principles that apply to subject-heading assignment at LC. They are 
based, for the most part, on Cutter&Ecirc;s ideas, and remain to this day the definitive ex-
pression of our basic assumptions about subject heading practice: 
</p>
<p>  1.  The reader as the focus.  The primary consideration in choosing a word 
as a subject heading is that it is the one people are most likely to look for 
in the catalog. 
</p>
<p>  2.  Unity.  A subject catalog must gather under one heading all the materials 
that deal with the subject, no matter what terms are used for it by authors, 
and whatever changing terms are used at different times. Catalogers 
choose the term with care and apply it uniformly to all materials on the 
subject. 
</p>
<p>  3.  Usage.  The heading chosen is in common use. 
  4.  English versus foreign terms.  English-language terms are preferred un-
</p>
<p>less a concept is foreign to Anglo-American experience, or when a for-
eign term is precise while its English counterpart is not. 
</p>
<p>  5.  Specificity.  When assigned, headings should be as specific as the topics 
they cover, not broader or narrower. Rather than apply a broader head-
ing, catalogers should use two specific headings that will approximately 
cover the topic. 3  
</p>
<p> EVALUATING SUBJECT CATALOGS 
</p>
<p> Subject catalogs can be evaluated using at least six criteria: recall, relevance, 
precision, exhaustivity, ease of use, and cost. These are described in detail in this 
section. 
</p>
<p>  Recall  refers to the amount of material retrieved when a heading is used in a 
search. To be considered good, subject headings in the catalog should retrieve enough 
material to satisfy searchers but not overwhelm them. If every movie in a very large 
collection of videorecordings of made-for-television movies had a different subject 
heading, the recall would be one item per subject heading. If all the items were as-
signed TELEVISION MOVIES, the searcher would retrieve all of them with that head-
ing. A balance is sought between these extremes. Someone using a subject heading 
should recall all items related to the subject but exclude unrelated items. 
</p>
<p>  Relevance  refers to how well materials retrieved using a subject heading match 
the searcher&Ecirc;s needs. A good subject catalog earns high marks here. The more specific 
a search is, the more likely what is found will be relevant. If a searcher wants some-
thing about computer programming and uses the subject heading PROGRAMMING 
(ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS), he should recall every item in the collection about 
the subject. However, that heading is assigned only to items entirely about the topic, </p>

<p>not to items with just a chapter about it. If the broader subject heading COMPUTERS 
were added to the original search, the searcher would retrieve items having a chap-
ter or two about programming, but this larger batch of material would also contain 
material about hardware, computer architecture, network design, and other irrelevant 
subjects. Relevance tends to decrease as the amount of recall increases, so relevance 
and recall are said to have an  inverse relationship.  
</p>
<p>  Precision  is the ability to specify exactly what is wanted, without using broader 
subject headings representing other things as well. Imagine that the searcher in the 
previous example was interested only in items about programming in BASIC, one 
programming language. The subject heading PROGRAMMING (ELECTRONIC 
COMPUTERS) retrieves material on all programming languages, including BASIC. 
If, however, the searcher used the subject heading BASIC (COMPUTER PROGRAM 
LANGUAGE), he or she would retrieve only materials covering BASIC programming. 
It allows for much more precision because it is narrower than either COMPUTERS 
or PROGRAMMING (ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS). Precision varies with subject 
heading specificity and is affected by the presence of overlapping and ambiguous 
terminology. 
</p>
<p>  Exhaustivity  refers to the amount (or depth) of subject cataloging. Some catalogers 
give each resource only one subject heading. Others may give up to three or five head-
ings, both common practices, to cover the overall subject matter of each item. Some 
catalogers might wish to furnish more, for example, subject headings for each chapter 
of a book or each part of an electronic resource. This is a deeper level, furnishing 
greater exhaustivity. The highest marks for exhaustivity go to a catalog furnishing 
subject headings for every idea contained within an item, like a back-of-the-book 
index. 
</p>
<p>  Ease of use  is judged by catalogers who assign subject headings and ordinary 
people using the library who search the catalog to find material they want. The subject 
heading system should be easy for both kinds of people to use. Catalogers should be 
able to find the headings they want quickly and have straightforward rules to follow 
for assigning headings. Ordinary people should be able to retrieve relevant materials 
using familiar words and phrases. If the words they search do not retrieve any mate-
rial, they should be assisted to try more productive alternatives. 
</p>
<p>  Cost  is an important factor to consider. The subject catalog must be affordable 
and should provide good service for the money spent on it. The dollars spent on pro-
ducing and maintaining the subject catalog is one thing to consider. The faster subject 
cataloging work can be done, the lower the cost per unit cataloged. A system that al-
lows computers or clerical staff to do the work generally is less costly than one that 
requires librarians to function. But cost alone is not the whole issue. In measuring the 
value received, another factor to consider is the impact of cataloging. If the catalog 
helps people find relevant material quickly and easily, the cost of subject cataloging 
may be justified. Cost is relative, and no standard measures for high- and low-cost 
cataloging exist. However, variations in cost and resulting service can be measured, 
if objective definitions of service are devised (e.g., better service = fewer requests 
for assistance with searches, or better service = an increase in use of materials with 
no more than a 2 percent increase in requests for assistance with searches). Once a 
definition of good service is established, experiments that balance cost and service 
can be done. </p>
<p/>

<p>340 16&mdash;Subject Analysis
</p>
<p> There are tradeoffs among cost, speed, and quality in producing and using sub-
ject catalogs. One criterion cannot measure a catalog&Ecirc;s worth, and all the criteria just 
described need to be put into a reasonable balance to achieve good service at bearable 
cost. No magic formulas dictate how deeply to index or how many cross-references to 
make, but problems demand the attention of concerned practitioners. 
</p>
<p> PROBLEMS OF THE SUBJECT CATALOG 
</p>
<p> Problems occur when different terms are used to express the same topic (some-
times due to changes over time in the meaning and usage of words or among the 
works of different authors); when topics overlap; when the number of records recalled 
in an average search is too great or too small; and, perhaps most critical of all, when 
authorized headings and searchers&Ecirc; vocabularies do not match. A person using terms 
that are not present in the catalog as subject headings or cross-references will find 
nothing. To promote the identification feature of the subject catalog, words used by 
searchers and authors should be present as headings. But if this were done, how would 
works on a subject be brought together? To promote the collocating feature, synony-
mous and quasi-synonymous terms are combined in one or a few carefully defined 
terms, whose specificity results in reasonable numbers of relevant retrieved items. 
</p>
<p> These conflicts have no single resolution, but computers offer new possibilities. 
Computers enable catalog users to search the words found in titles, summaries, and 
other descriptive areas containing information about the content of works in &bdquo;natural 
language&permil; (that is, not in subject heading terminology) in addition to the designated 
subject headings. Computers permit searching any word of a subject heading (that is, 
a subject keyword), even if it is not the first word of a heading. Such searches were 
not possible in card catalogs, in which only the word in the filing position (called the 
&bdquo;lead term&permil;) could be searched. New retrieval capabilities made possible when sub-
ject catalogs are computerized include the following: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Searches with partial data (for example, if an asterisk stands for any let-
ters, COMPUT* can retrieve both COMPUT ERS  and COMPUT ING,  and 
*COMPUT* can retrieve both of those plus  MICRO COMPUT ERS  and 
 MINI COMPUT ERS ). 
</p>
<p> &bull; Search requests can be saved and used in more than one database or catalog 
file. 
</p>
<p> &bull; More than one subject heading can be combined into complex requests, 
for example, COMPUTERS AND ART, or MUSIC AND POPULAR NOT 
JAZZ. 
</p>
<p> &bull; A subject heading can be combined with other bibliographic elements in a 
single search, for example, SU = SYMPHONIES AND AU = MOZART. 
</p>
<p> &bull; The catalog can be accessed from outside the library via the Internet. 
 &bull; Local acquisition and circulation data, as well as catalog records, can be 
</p>
<p>accessed so a searcher can determine an item&Ecirc;s availability. 
</p>
<p> This list is not exhaustive. The boundaries between search capabilities that re-
quire use of a particular kind of subject vocabulary and those that only need a properly </p>

<p>Subject Authorities: Numbers for Classification 341
</p>
<p>programmed computer system are blurring. The use of computers did not make con-
trolled vocabularies obsolete, as some predicted in the 1980s. Instead, it led to intensi-
fied efforts to improve controlled vocabularies and develop new ways to search data 
elements likely to express subject content. 
</p>
<p> SUBJECT AUTHORITIES: NUMBERS FOR CLASSIFICATION 
</p>
<p> A second type of subject-related authority is the source from which numbers for 
classification are taken. The DDC and the LCC, two of the most popular classification 
systems, are discussed in chapter 18. Both systems consist mainly of lists of numbers, 
each number paired with a term for the subject matter it represents. Helpful informa-
tion is often added to the list of numbers, such as introductions giving the history and 
background of the system, instructions on how to assign the numbers, and indexes 
(that is, lists of verbal terms) to the numbers. Individual numbers or groups of num-
bers, known as &bdquo;number spans,&permil; may have scope notes explaining what they cover or 
exclude and, in the latter instance, suggested alternatives. 
</p>
<p> Libraries generally choose one classification to assign to their materials, al-
though nothing prevents them from adopting multiple classifications simultaneously. 
In the United States and Canada, classification numbers are used mainly to arrange 
materials on library shelves, forming the basis of shelf addresses that group materials 
covering the same topics. In other parts of the world, classification numbers may be 
used to organize catalogs and bibliographies as well as to shelve materials. The  Brit-
ish National Bibliography  is an example of a bibliography arranged by Dewey num-
bers. North American libraries often maintain shelflists&middot;catalogs arranged by call 
number&middot;for inventory-control purposes. Traditionally, shelflists were separate card 
files accessible solely to library staff. Today, shelflists are part of computerized cata-
logs and may be accessed by the public and by library staff members. 
</p>
<p> Like subject vocabularies, classifications can be precoordinated/enumerative or 
postcoordinated/faceted/synthetic. Elements of pre- and postcoordination appear in 
DDC and LCC to different degrees. LCC is overwhelmingly precoordinated, enumer-
ating hundreds of thousands of numbers for classifiers to assign to materials. Never-
theless, LCC also has tables listing specific aspects of topics to be added to numbers 
from the main list if classifiers want to limit or qualify a topic. DDC has fewer num-
bers in its enumeration. It also has six auxiliary tables listing aspects of topics that 
further specify them and instructions within number spans to apply subdivisions of 
one topic to other topics within the span. Tables and subdivision instructions add a 
measure of synthesis to the systems. They economize on the total number of enumer-
ated classification numbers. Over time, DDC has grown from fewer than 50 pages to 
more than 3,000, and LCC consists of more than 40 volumes, so such economies are 
valuable both from practical and theoretical points of view. 
</p>
<p> Fully faceted classifications are not used very much in North America, but they 
have enjoyed popularity elsewhere in the world. Among the better-known faceted 
classifications are the Colon Classification, the Universal Decimal Classification, and 
the Bliss Classification. Colon Classification originated in the early part of the 20th 
century, devised by S. R. Ranganathan, an Indian librarian. It was adopted by a num-
ber of Indian libraries, though the number has dwindled in recent years. Colon </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>342 16&mdash;Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>Classification divides the universe of knowledge into 41 main classes to which num-
bers for five facets are added to build complete numbers. Ranganathan called his five 
facet types Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, and Time. A complex system of letters 
from multiple alphabets, numbers, and symbols are used for the numbers. 
</p>
<p> The Universal Decimal Classification (UDC; see http://www.udcc.org), a trans-
formation of DDC devised by Belgians Henri Otlet and Henri La Fontaine, interna-
tionalized DDC by translating it into French. UDC was also intended to accommodate 
automation. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) adopted UDC, which uses Arabic numbers and a few symbols, and up-
dated it in the latter part of the 20th century. Since then, it has been used in Europe to 
arrange bibliographies. 
</p>
<p> The Bliss Classification, devised by Henry Evelyn Bliss, librarian at the City 
College of New York, was used for many years in that library and a few libraries in 
England, but it did not develop a following. Bliss Classification uses capital letters 
and a few symbols. After Bliss&Ecirc;s death, practical considerations in keeping the system 
up-to-date and teaching classifiers how to assign the numbers led the City College of 
New York library to switch to LCC. British librarians John Mills and Vanda Broughton 
continue to update the Bliss system, but its users remain a small group of libraries. 4  
</p>
<p> The discussion of the kinds of characters and symbols used by various classifica-
tions raises the question of the choice of characters used to represent the categories. 
Known as the  notation,  classifications can use only one type or more than one; for 
example, letters only or letters and numbers. Single-character notation is called  pure 
notation,  and multiple-character notation is called  mixed notation.  DDC uses pure 
notation (Arabic numbers, punctuated once with a dot or point, hence the name &bdquo;deci-
mal&permil;), whereas LCC uses a mixed notation consisting of capital letters and Arabic 
numbers, sometimes punctuated by a dot or point. The type of notation used results in 
longer or shorter combinations for very specific topics. In a pure notation system, the 
more specific a category is the longer the number representing it must be. A mixed 
notation system has greater flexibility to vary the types and positions of the characters 
in order to keep numbers short, even for very specific topics. 
</p>
<p> PRINCIPLES OF CLASSIFICATION 
</p>
<p> Classification systems use codes called &bdquo;numbers&permil; to identify the subject matter 
of materials, even when the numbers consist of characters other than digits. The use 
of numbers on the materials frees classification from many of the linguistic problems 
that affect subject headings and subject catalogs. Still, classifications have problems 
of their own and they are not completely free of language-related problems. The lists 
of classification numbers use words to identify the subject matter the numbers repre-
sent, but these words are not displayed to the public. 
</p>
<p> An issue of importance is the underlying philosophy of the classification, which 
dictates the method chosen to distinguish subjects from one another. A series of main 
classes is selected as the first analysis of knowledge into smaller components. Then, 
subsequent subdivisions may follow the same pattern or different patterns, and all 
subject areas may be treated alike or each subject area may be treated differently, 
according to ideas associated solely with that area. One might begin by dividing the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Principles of Classification 343
</p>
<p>universe of knowledge into animal, vegetable, and mineral. Or one might divide it 
into humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Some might divide it into earth, sky, 
fire, and water. Library classifications usually divide knowledge into disciplines fa-
miliar to academia. DDC begins with 10 main classes; LCC with 21; and Colon Clas-
sification with 41. None of these systems is good or bad, better or worse; none is right 
or wrong. They simply start from different perspectives and draw their boundaries 
differently. 
</p>
<p> A classification must cover all the subjects needed for the materials in the collec-
tion, which, for general libraries, means the entire universe of knowledge. A medical 
library might not need a classification that deals in detail with music and religion, but 
some subtopics related to these disciplines need to be covered, such as music therapy, 
medical problems unique to musicians, religious tenets pertaining to medicine and 
medical practice, and faith healing, among others. If there were no numbers in the 
classification for music and religion per se, these would have to be subsumed under 
other rubrics. To function over long periods of time, a classification must be open to 
the inclusion of new subjects not known when the classification originated&middot;a feature 
of classification called &bdquo;hospitality.&permil; It is difficult to predict where new topics and 
subtopics will emerge or whether changes will occur in the relationships among top-
ics, but since knowledge in all subjects is constantly evolving, a classification must 
be able to handle the changes. 
</p>
<p> To be easily used, the system must follow logical, recognizable patterns, both for 
the people using its numbers to find materials and for library classifiers assigning its 
numbers to materials. Easily memorized notation is a feature that contributes to ease of 
use. Short numbers are more convenient than long ones, although in classifications that 
show the whole hierarchy preceding a very specific topic, the numbers can be very long. 
</p>
<p> DDC and LCC both employ the principle of relative location, which means that 
materials are shifted to accommodate new materials being added to a library&Ecirc;s collec-
tion so the new items stand with others on the same subjects. Both also operate on the 
principle of classification by discipline, although they differ about what constitutes 
a discipline or main class. DDC has fewer main classes than LCC, even though both 
cover all subjects. Some (but not all) of the differences between the way the two sys-
tems divide knowledge include the following: 
</p>
<p> &bull; DDC has one main class for all the social sciences (300); LCC has four that 
include H (e.g., sociology, demographics, economics, social problems), 
J (political science), K (law), and L (education). 
</p>
<p> &bull; DDC makes medicine a subdivision of technology and applied science 
(612), while LCC makes medicine a main class (R). 
</p>
<p> &bull; DDC divides language and literature into two separate main classes (400 
and 800, respectively), whereas LCC combines them into one large main 
class (P). 
</p>
<p> The philosophies underlying DDC and LCC differ considerably. DDC is a natu-
ral or hierarchical classification of all knowledge in which each discipline starts with 
the broadest possible categories and proceeds through narrower categories until the 
most specific categories of the subject are represented. This principle of hierarchy 
facilitates browsing and discovery by less knowledgeable searchers. DDC has one </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>344 16&mdash;Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>set of rules for the entire classification and employs memory aids. LCC is designed 
only to arrange LC&Ecirc;s materials on its shelves in a logical, subject-oriented order. LC&Ecirc;s 
stacks are closed to the public and browsing is not an issue. LCC uses the same rules 
within a main class but permits different rules to apply between main classes. 
</p>
<p> Some classification systems do not reflect the subject content of materials and 
primarily provide shelf location, not subject access. One such system assigns numbers 
to materials sequentially as each item is added to a collection; for example, book 1 
is the first book acquired, book 2 is the second, and so forth. This is called an &bdquo;ac-
cession number&permil; system and reflects the order of acquisition. In an accession number 
system, materials are not shifted when new items arrive. Once classified, materials 
remain in the same place for as long as they are held. Another system alphabetizes 
materials, shelving them by a chosen element, usually authors&Ecirc; names or title words. 
These systems are logical, follow recognizable patterns, and provide shelf addresses 
for materials, but they fail to reveal subject matter or group materials on a subject in 
one place on the shelves. Caution should be used before adopting these systems, be-
cause they make browsing difficult and are costly to change. 
</p>
<p> North American library classifications are used primarily for shelving and, there-
fore, are two dimensional or linear. The numbers start at the first one and proceed 
sequentially to the last one, for example, 001&ndash;999 for DDC or A-Z for LCC. Knowl-
edge, however, does not behave in a linear fashion. Think of the topics mentioned 
previously: medicine, music, and religion. They are distinct disciplines, but they have 
cross-disciplinary meanings, such as music therapy and faith healing. Music therapy 
is also related to religious music and aromatherapy, and faith healing is related to 
faith-based charities and meditation chants, which can be involved in medical treat-
ment. Topics do not follow one after the other in linear fashion but instead branch out 
helter-skelter in all directions. All the relationships cannot be maintained simultane-
ously in a linear system. 
</p>
<p> Faceted systems, which begin with the parts of subjects, behave differently. In 
a faceted system, related parts can be moved about to stand together, on request. For 
instance, faith-based charities and faith healing can be linked through a number that 
stands for &bdquo;faith.&permil; Aromatherapy and music therapy can be linked via a number for 
&bdquo;therapy.&permil; Faceted classification numbers can be permuted to link whatever common 
facets are present. When used for shelving, though, only some of the numbers can be 
used, because library shelves are linear and only accommodate a linear sequence of 
numbers. In a catalog or a bibliography, however, the numbers can be displayed as 
appropriate in different places to show each of the facets to a searcher, as shown in 
Figure 16.2. (Note the similarity to keyword searching.)    
</p>
<p> CALL NUMBERS 
</p>
<p> Classification numbers, as mentioned, are the basis for locating materials on li-
brary shelves. Numbers or alphabetic codes representing such elements as main en-
tries, particular collections, dates of publication, titles, volumes, and so on, known 
collectively as shelf marks, are usually added to classification numbers to complete 
the addresses for materials. The entire combination, consisting of the classification 
number plus the shelf marks, is known as a  call number.  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Call Numbers 345
</p>
<p> Librarians are not unanimous about assigning a different call number to each title 
in a library&Ecirc;s collection. Large libraries often choose to assign a unique call number 
to each title. Small libraries that have no more than a few titles on most subjects 
have no problem when several different ones are shelved at the &bdquo;same&permil; address. (The 
word &bdquo;same&permil; is enclosed in quotations because two physical entities cannot occupy 
the same space; rather, it means all the titles that share the same call number may be 
randomly shelved at the designated location.) 
</p>
<p> The first shelf mark assigned after a document is classified usually is, by unof-
ficial agreement, an alphanumeric code representing the main entry of the item called 
a  cutter number.  The name comes from the fact that Charles Cutter was the first to 
publish a list of these codes. Cutter&Ecirc;s tables were later revised by a librarian named 
Margaret Sanborn and called Cutter-Sanborn tables. 5  LC synthesizes cutter numbers 
from a simple set of rules available free via its Web site. 6  Today cutter is spelled with 
a small &bdquo;c&permil; and is also a verb&middot;librarians refer to assigning these numbers as &bdquo;cutter-
ing&permil; them. 
</p>
<p> Small libraries and media centers sometimes substitute call letters for cutter 
numbers in call numbers because they are easier to apply. The first one, two, or three 
letters of the main entry are used as call letters. If the main entry is a title, the call let-
ters are not taken from initial articles but from the word following them. Call letters 
may be expressed in all uppercase letters or both uppercase and lowercase letters. For 
example, a book by Jane Austen could be assigned the call letters A, AU, Au, AUS, or 
Aus, depending on the policy on call letters and preferred lettering style. This system 
does not always produce unique call numbers; for example, books on the same sub-
ject by two authors named Rose and Ross could have the same classification number 
</p>
<p>Figure 16.2. The DDC as a faceted scheme.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>346 16&mdash;Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>and the same call letters. In a small collection this is not a problem and saves money 
in the classifier&Ecirc;s time and the purchase of special cuttering tools. 
</p>
<p> Other shelf marks in call numbers may include one or more letters of the alpha-
bet preceding the classification number for the particular collection to which an item 
belongs, such as &bdquo;R&permil; or &bdquo;Ref,&permil; for reference materials or &bdquo;J&permil; for children&Ecirc;s materials 
(standing for &bdquo;Juvenile&permil; materials). Alphabetic designations for biography (B/BIO/
Bio), fiction (F/FIC/Fic), oversized items (O), and audiovisual materials (AV) are 
popular, also. Within particular collections, subcategories can be distinguished by the 
use of spine labels depicting icons for science fiction (an atom), mystery (a gun), 
westerns (a rearing horse), or Canadian items (a maple leaf). These labels describe 
content rather than location but can also be used for location. 
</p>
<p> A popular addition to cutter numbers symbolizing author main entries for authors 
who write more than one title is a letter or two from the first significant word in each 
title. This addition results in arranging the author&Ecirc;s works on the shelf in alphabetical 
order by title without having to look beyond the call number. The method works, but 
it tends to lengthen call numbers and complicate them for classifiers and members of 
the public seeking desired items. 
</p>
<p> Dates added to call numbers are now frequently encountered in libraries. At first, 
LC added them primarily to distinguish editions of a title subsequent to the first edi-
tion. Thus, a copy of the 22nd edition of DDC shelved in the reference collection 
might have the complex LCC call number R/Z696/.D519/2003, meaning: 
</p>
<p> R = Reference collection 
 Z696 = LCC classification number for library classifications. 
 D519 = The cutter number for Dewey, the author main entry 
 2003 = Date of the edition 
</p>
<p> In recent years, dates are routinely added as shelf marks, following the cutter 
numbers. 
</p>
<p> The final shelf mark classifiers may add, as appropriate, are volume numbers. 
Volume numbers distinguish individual volumes of multivolume titles. For example, 
DDC is a four-volume document. All the volumes are assigned the same call number, 
so each individual volume also needs a volume number, following the date, to ensure 
that it is shelved in the proper order. 
</p>
<p> Complex call numbers containing many shelf marks are useful for staff in large 
libraries who shelve many items with similar call numbers, but they are hard for 
members of the public to remember when they go from the catalog to the shelf, and 
difficult to write down without making mistakes. Library policies governing small 
collections can simplify call numbers by mandating fewer shelf marks, thus making it 
easier for members of the public to retrieve (or request) materials. It might not make 
much difference in small libraries if several materials share the same call number. 
</p>
<p> EVALUATING CLASSIFICATIONS 
</p>
<p> Criteria similar to those used in evaluating subject catalogs can be applied to 
classifications. They include the level of specificity afforded by the system; the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Evaluating Classifications 347
</p>
<p>browsability it produces; its ease of use, including understandable notation, mnemon-
ics, indexing, and simple rules for the assignment of numbers; its hospitality to new 
subjects; regular updating; and its cost. 
</p>
<p>  The level of specificity  should be appropriate to the size and distribution of the 
library&Ecirc;s collections. If the classification has a few broad numbers, many items on 
diverse aspects of a topic will be classified in the same number. If it has a great many 
narrow numbers, very few items will be classified in the same number even if their 
content is closely related. A balance appropriate to the collection being classified 
should be sought. Sometimes, local adjustments to classification systems are made 
by libraries to accommodate their individual needs. 
</p>
<p>  Browsability  as a feature of classifications depends to a large degree on the sub-
ject relationships it presents. In most instances, progression from broader to narrower 
topics in a subject area enhances browsing. The logic of subject relationships should 
be clear to a searcher, making it possible to anticipate where to look for a desired sub-
ject or subdivision. The juxtaposition of subjects also affects browsability. Folklore 
and cannibalism&middot;subjects most people do not consider closely related&middot;are only 
a few numbers apart in DDC, whereas English language and English literature are 
several hundred numbers apart. Similarly, dance and drama are quite far apart in LCC 
(dance is in G; drama in P) even though many people think of them as closely related 
performing arts, whereas they are neighbors in DDC (dance is in the 790s; theater is 
in the 800s). 
</p>
<p>  Ease of use  depends on many factors, including an easily remembered, easily un-
derstood type of notation. The flexibility of the notation to handle numerous narrow 
categories while still being economical also affects the ease of use, as does mnemonic 
numbering (using the same number for a topic or subtopic wherever it appears). The 
presence of good indexes to the numbers is essential for classifiers and ordinary 
searchers. An asset for classifiers is the existence of relatively uncomplicated rules 
for assigning the numbers. 
</p>
<p> Regarding  hospitality,  classification systems cannot be expected to cover un-
known subjects, but how new subjects are handled when they emerge is a matter of 
concern. Ideally, a hospitable system can incorporate them into the list of numbers 
in a way that retains appropriate relations with related subjects. Practically speaking, 
this can also mean having to revise related areas, as was the case when the subject 
of computers emerged. Classifications must be updated regularly to add or alter cat-
egories as knowledge of subjects and perceptions of their relationships change over 
the years. 
</p>
<p> The  cost  of using a classification is an important aspect of its total value. If a 
cataloger adopts the same classification as his or her peers and can share the burden of 
assigning numbers to commonly held materials, it is likely to be less costly than using 
a unique classification and doing all the work alone. Cost was a major factor in the 
decisions of college and university libraries that changed from other classifications to 
LCC after OCLC&Ecirc;s shared cataloging database was established. Because LC&Ecirc;s cata-
loging was the lion&Ecirc;s share of the records in the network database in its early years, it 
was less costly for OCLC member libraries to copy its numbers and avoid the burden 
of classifying the same materials differently. The cost of the classification authority 
and related materials is another factor to be considered as well as the average time and 
necessary expertise required for assigning numbers to new materials. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>348 16&mdash;Subject Analysis
</p>
<p> Some features, such as browsability and ease of use, are difficult to measure. 
Doing so means translating them into concrete terms so they can be measured. It is 
worth making a serious effort to do so if changes in a library&Ecirc;s classification practices 
are contemplated. Although savings might be achieved in some areas, new costs might 
be incurred in other areas. Sometimes the savings only benefit the library, whereas 
the searchers end up having to do more work to find what they want. The value of a 
classification should be figured as a total package that includes the amount of service 
provided as well as the total cost. 
</p>
<p> MAINTENANCE ISSUES 
</p>
<p> Maintaining subject catalogs and classifications involves making policy deci-
sions. When card catalogs were the rule, libraries could choose whether to present 
one dictionary catalog containing name, title, and subject headings in one file or 
divide the file into two separate files: one for names and titles, and a second for sub-
jects. Current computerized catalogs typically require that searchers select an index 
before entering a search term (subject, title, keyword, or name). This is the same as 
presenting several divided files. If their first attempts do not bring the desired results, 
searchers must remember to try other available files. 
</p>
<p> Another policy issue concerns cross-references. Keeping track of cross-
references and changing them when necessary is a difficult and costly process. Cross-
references branch out rapidly&middot;one heading can have several cross-references, each 
of which has more of its own. Decisions must be made about how extensively these 
will be made. Searchers dislike cross-references that lead them to terms having no 
materials listed under them, called  blind references.  Policies for maintaining the 
cross-reference structure can prevent this from happening. Some librarians believe 
cross-references teach users about related subjects and that all references given in the 
subject authority should be present in the catalog whether or not they lead to any en-
tries. (If such a policy is followed, catalogers can add notations to headings that lack 
materials explaining that the library has no holdings on those topics.) Others believe 
the cost of creating and maintaining a living cross-reference structure (called a  syn-
detic  structure) is unwarranted when it doesn&Ecirc;t lead to use of materials. 
</p>
<p> Each library must weigh three alternatives&middot;to include all, some, or no cross-
references&middot;and arrive at a viable policy for its catalog. Some decide about cross-
references on a case-by-case basis, but it is more efficient to systematize the policy so 
that individual decisions are unnecessary. 
</p>
<p> The way subject headings are filed also has implications for maintenance. Two 
different arrangements of subject headings are furnished by the rules used by LC and 
those published by American Library Association (ALA). 7  The Library of Congress&Ecirc;s 
filing rules distinguish between different subject heading forms and subdivision types. 
ALA&Ecirc;s filing rules do not. Figure 16.3 illustrates how the use of each method would 
cause an identical group of headings to be arranged.    
</p>
<p> Maintaining the library&Ecirc;s classification system also involves decisions. Foremost 
among these is how to incorporate updates to the system. Ideally, all changes to the 
numbers are adopted, which means the affected materials and their catalog records 
are reprocessed with new numbers and shelved in their new locations. In a less-than-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Subject Analysis for Literary Works 349
</p>
<p>ideal world in which staff time is at a premium, following such a policy might mean 
allowing new materials to go unprocessed while staff members revise materials that 
have already been processed once. Librarians view such developments with displea-
sure and tend to resist adopting changes in classification numbers. The authors recom-
mend adopting changes judiciously, over limited periods of time, enabling the library 
to benefit from the results without committing all its resources to making the changes 
at once. 
</p>
<p> Another matter of importance, especially for libraries with large collections, is 
the arrangement of the shelves. Choices include starting with the first number and fol-
lowing through to the last, all-in-one sequence, or grouping parts of the collection out 
of sequence in specially designated locations. Music and art are sometimes chosen to 
be set apart from the rest of the collection. Science and technology materials, medical 
materials, and law materials also may be grouped separately, sometimes in depart-
ments or buildings of their own. Reference works are usually deployed in a separate 
sequence or in special rooms to provide workspace for users. Children&Ecirc;s materials are 
frequently set apart from adult materials, and material intended for teens may be set 
apart from both of those. 
</p>
<p> The age of materials may play a role, with older materials stored in less ac-
cessible locations and newer materials shelved in more accessible locations. Newly 
acquired materials, for example, are often placed in the most visible areas so users 
can find them easily. Exceptions to the regular shelving system can add extra time 
to a browser&Ecirc;s task and to staff workload, but doing so may be justified if it is clear 
that most people using specific out-of-sequence materials focus solely on them and 
benefit from having them set apart from other collections. Studies have not been done 
to demonstrate this is the case, but lack of data has not influenced librarians who wish 
to adopt such arrangements. 
</p>
<p> SUBJECT ANALYSIS FOR LITERARY WORKS 
</p>
<p> Assigning subject headings and classification numbers to literary works (novels, 
plays, stories, poetry, and so on) also called works of imagination, should be consid-
ered carefully. For decades, policies at Library and Archives Canada (LAC), LC, and 
other large libraries limited the assignment of subject headings to nonfiction works 
unless they were collections of texts by more than one author, texts augmented by 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>350 16&mdash;Subject Analysis
</p>
<p>literary criticism, or historical or biographical works. People were thought to seek 
literary works in the catalog solely by their authors or titles, not by subject. Children 
and youth, however, often choose (or are guided by parents, teachers, media special-
ists, and librarians to choose) to learn about something by reading about it in stories. 
In the 1960s, in response to many requests from librarians and media specialists, LC 
established new policies for children&Ecirc;s fiction providing both subject headings and 
summary notes. The LC Annotated Card Program, now called &bdquo;Children&Ecirc;s Subject 
Headings,&permil; is discussed more fully in chapter 17. 
</p>
<p> Searchers have come to expect subject headings for children&Ecirc;s fiction. Many 
years ago, ALA&Ecirc;s Subject Analysis Committee published guidelines for assigning 
them and lists of genre headings for various types of material. 8  Recently, practitioners 
have argued successfully for the assignment of genre headings for adult fiction in 
many media. LC experimented with the new genre headings, found them helpful, and 
encourages others to do the same. Local libraries need to establish policies for subject 
access to literary works based on estimates of searchers&Ecirc; need for them and the librar-
ies&Ecirc; ability do the added work. 
</p>
<p> Similarly, many public libraries choose not to classify fiction and biography. 
They assume that people always seek these materials by an author&Ecirc;s name or, in the 
case of biographies, a subject&Ecirc;s name. One code such as F, FIC, or Fic, for fiction and 
B, BIO, or Bio, for biography is assigned and the materials are shelved in alphabetic 
order by author or subject. Academic libraries, on the other hand, tend to classify 
everything, including works of imagination, keeping them in the order prescribed by 
the classification scheme. This aids catalog searchers and should not hinder browsers 
at the shelf. 
</p>
<p> WHY USE STANDARD SYSTEMS? 
</p>
<p> A library might be tempted to dispense with standard subject headings and stan-
dard classification numbers. It might seem easier to make up appropriate headings 
and numbers than to buy expensive tools and be bound by the terms they offer. Why 
invest time and money in them? First, making up local subject headings and classi-
fication numbers puts the burden of keeping track of selected terms entirely on cata-
logers&Ecirc; shoulders. Catalogers must also decide how to define subject-heading terms 
and classification numbers and make up rules about how to apply them. In the case of 
subject headings, catalogers must also decide what cross-references should be made 
for each term. In the case of classification, a consistent notation must be constructed. 
It is time consuming to create and maintain subject and classification authorities, and 
requires a great deal of expertise to do properly. If other staff members do subject 
cataloging and classification, lists of headings and class numbers must be made avail-
able to them in a usable form. Even if all the work is done alone, a properly written 
list is needed for searchers to consult. All of this is extremely costly, and makes the 
cost of published lists conceived and maintained by LC, LAC, and others appear more 
reasonable. 
</p>
<p> Second, if catalogers use nonstandard subject headings and classification num-
bers, they cannot use the ones assigned by others or benefit from the work they do. If </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Summary 351
</p>
<p>the library enters a network environment, the terms can be accommodated as locally 
defined headings and classification numbers, but no one else can use them. 
</p>
<p> Third, the catalog is an ongoing tool, not the individual expression of one collec-
tion at one point in time, managed by one librarian. Complete, explicit instructions 
on how headings or classification numbers have been chosen, used, and managed, 
and a complete list of terms, cross-references, or numbers must be provided to the 
cataloger&Ecirc;s successors. Another librarian might not wish to continue the system or 
decide that it is not cost-effective and opt to change to a standard system. Then, the 
entire collection must be converted to standard systems. Establishing unique subject 
headings or classification numbers should be undertaken only after the library has as-
sessed the alternatives and rejected them for good reasons. A nonstandard subject or 
classification authority could result in less effective service overall. 
</p>
<p> Some public libraries are experimenting with &bdquo;reader interest&permil; classifications, 
similar to the way that materials are arranged and displayed in bookstores, in place of 
DDC or LCC. While it is possible that reader interest systems can provide satisfactory 
service on-site, they preclude enabling the libraries to copy standard call numbers 
used by other libraries and can complicate browsing for off-site searchers. It remains 
to be seen whether reader interest classifications attract more followers. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> Subject analysis&middot;describing the content of library materials and making it pos-
sible to find by people searching for material on particular subjects&middot;is a matter of 
determining what the content is and representing it by means of subject headings and 
classification numbers. Catalogers learn to find clues to subject content via titles, 
tables of contents, indexes, and other introductory information. Once they are clear 
about the scope, coverage, and approach of the creator, catalogers can consult subject 
heading and classification authorities to find appropriate words and numbers for the 
material. 
</p>
<p> Two different ways of presenting subject headings and classification numbers 
are providing lists that enumerate them in their final form and lists of subject parts 
from which catalogers can build the headings and numbers. Fully formed headings 
and numbers are said to be precoordinated; parts that must be put together to form 
headings and numbers are said to be postcoordinated. 
</p>
<p> Subject heading and classification authorities are described in terms of their un-
derlying principles, criteria for evaluating them, and an overview of their problems. 
Call numbers&middot;the shelf addresses libraries use to place materials on the shelves&middot;are 
formed by adding shelf marks to classification numbers. 
</p>
<p> The maintenance of subject catalogs and classification systems includes deci-
sions on how to deploy the subject catalog&Ecirc;s files, whether to have one sequence of 
shelving or several, and how to deal with updates and other changes in the subject 
authorities. The trend toward treating literary works (also known as works of imagi-
nation) like nonfiction materials by assigning subject headings and classifying them 
also requires making decisions at the local level about those services. </p>

<p> &middot;Mark Twain 
</p>
<p> In this chapter, two published lists used as sources for subject headings&middot; Library 
of Congress Subject Headings  and  Sears List of Subject Headings &middot;are described. 
They are the most popular subject authorities used by libraries in Canada and the 
United States. Libraries beyond the borders of North America have also adopted them 
to reap the benefits of global shared cataloging and to save work, time, and money. 
</p>
<p> LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SUBJECT HEADINGS 
</p>
<p>  Library of Congress Subject Headings  (LCSH) began development in 1909, 
based on a list of subject headings compiled and issued by the American Library 
Association (ALA) called  The List of Subject Headings for Use in Dictionary Catalogs.  
Subject specialists at the Library of Congress (LC) adopted many of the headings 
exactly as they appeared in the ALA list, modified others, and created new ones when 
they did not find what they needed on the list. In 1914, LC first published its work 
under the title  Subject Headings Used in the Dictionary Catalogues of the Library of 
Congress.  Subsequently, new editions of LCSH appeared about once every 10 years 
until 1988, when conversion to a computerized database was completed. At that time, 
printed editions began to be issued annually, and electronic versions were developed, 
first in CD-ROM and, later, online. 
</p>
<p> LCSH&Ecirc;s vocabulary was initially established, grew, and continues to grow, based 
on the contents of items in the LC&Ecirc;s collection. As a result, it lacks headings for topics 
not included in the collection. Moreover, it has not followed a consistent set of rules </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>356 17&mdash;Subject Authorities
</p>
<p>for creating new headings for the list during a century of growth. Subject headings 
were created according to the ideas of the heads of subject cataloging. Despite these 
drawbacks, LCSH is widely used in North America, United Kingdom, and elsewhere. 
Its appeal is attributable to three factors: (1) LC collects many more books in nearly 
all subjects than other general libraries and, therefore, it needs to establish subject 
headings for them; (2) it does a fine job of maintaining and distributing the ever-
growing list of authorized subject headings and cross-references; and (3) it charges 
very reasonably for its work. 
</p>
<p> The Publication 
</p>
<p> An online version of LCSH is available by subscription from LC as part of its 
 Classification Web  product. Weekly lists of new and changed LCSH headings are part 
of LC&Ecirc;s  Cataloger&Ecirc;s Desktop  product. The LCSH introduction is also included there. 
Individual subject headings can be searched and browsed free of charge on LC&Ecirc;s web 
site, in its authority files. Still, many libraries continue to buy LCSH in book form. 
The 32nd edition is current at this writing, although LC&Ecirc;s Cataloging Distribution Ser-
vice Web site states that the 31st edition is still in print. It contains approximately 
308,000 authorized terms and cross-references, introductory and explanatory informa-
tion, and supplementary material&middot;including subdivisions, genre/form headings, and 
children&Ecirc;s headings&middot;bound into six massive volumes with distinctive red covers. 
Some libraries that purchase the online version of LCSH for the cataloging depart-
ment also purchase the printed publication as a reference tool for library patrons, 
keeping it in the reference collection or near the public catalog. Paper updates to the 
printed LCSH are found in LC&Ecirc;s  Cataloging Service Bulletin , available from its Cata-
loging Distribution Service as a subscription issued twice a year. 
</p>
<p> Detailed instructions for applying LCSH are provided separately in  Subject 
Cataloging Manual: Subject Headings,  also available online in  Cataloger&Ecirc;s Desktop  
and in a four-volume loose-leaf publication that cumulates decisions and interpreta-
tions originally compiled for LC&Ecirc;s subject catalogers. In response to requests from 
libraries using LCSH, LC began to publish the manual so all LCSH users could apply 
it more consistently. The manual covers general issues; treatment of many types of 
topics, such as biography, visual images, literary materials; and the appropriate use 
of a group of general subdivisions known as  free-floating subdivisions.  These are sub-
division terms that can be added, with some limitations, to subject headings from the 
main list. The free-floating subdivisions appear in volume VI of the printed edition, 
titled  Supplementary Vocabularies,  as well as in  Cataloger&Ecirc;s Desktop, Classification 
Web,  and a separate paper publication titled  Free-Floating Subdivisions: An Alpha-
betic Index.  Together, the subject heading list and subdivisions, manual, and updates 
constitute a complete LCSH subject-heading authority system. 
</p>
<p> Catalogers using LCSH are expected to coordinate their use of the list with other 
cataloging tools. Most LCSH headings and cross-references are topical terms. Some 
names appear in the list (see Figure 17.1), but LCSH does not control them. The same 
name authority file used to control descriptive headings (see chapter 15) is used to 
control the names of people, geographic locations, corporate bodies, and titles used as 
subject headings. Catalogers are directed to add name and title headings as needed. 
When the name authority file does not list a wanted name or title, catalogers establish 
it following the form prescribed by the  Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules,  second </p>

<p>edition, 2002 revision, 2005 update (AACR2-2005). With a few exceptions, catalog-
ers cannot add topical headings to LCSH. Instead, they are instructed to use the most 
appropriate authorized headings already present in the list and wait for the LC to add 
the desired new headings.

<p>358 17&mdash;Subject Authorities
</p>
<p> Format of LCSH Entries 
</p>
<p> In the printed edition of LCSH, authorized headings are listed in bold print; un-
authorized headings and cross-references in plain print. LCSH prints headings three 
columns to a page (see Figure 17.1). 
</p>
<p> When appropriate for a topic, an abbreviated instruction to subdivide it geographi-
cally appears immediately after the heading (explained later). Coded instructions for 
making cross-references (UF, BT, RT, SA, and NT, also explained later) appear with 
the subject headings to which they relate. Cross-references are given in that order and, 
within each category, in alphabetical order. If a subject heading&Ecirc;s meaning might be 
in question, instructions in the form of scope notes are given about how to use it, be-
ginning with the words &bdquo; Here are entered . . . &permil; The instructions are usually framed in 
positive language, but occasionally state what should  not  be entered under a particular 
heading and, sometimes, suggest alternatives for specific subject areas. 
</p>
<p> LC classification numbers are listed for many of the main headings and for some 
of the subdivided headings. These are merely suggestions and should not be assigned 
without consulting the full classification schedules directly. They are a useful shortcut 
alternative to consulting page after page of numbers in crowded portions of the sched-
ules and can provide a guide to unfamiliar territory. 
</p>
<p> LCSH uses a variety of grammatical constructions for its headings from one-word 
headings to complex multiword headings. One-word headings usually are nouns or 
verb forms used like nouns, such as FISHING. Sometimes, the plural form of a noun 
is preferred, for example, FISHES is the authorized heading for these animals, not 
&bdquo;fish.&permil; Different meanings can depend on whether a topical word is singular or plural, 
for example, BUILDING is used for the process of construction, while BUILDINGS 
is used for structures or edifices. 
</p>
<p> A noun modified by an adjective (or a second noun that functions like an adjec-
tive) is another grammatical type, for example, TELEVISION CAMERAS. LCSH 
sometimes reverses the order in which the words appear to bring the more important 
word to the filing position, for example, COSMOLOGY, ANCIENT. With computer-
based keyword searching, the order of words does not matter, but in printed lists and 
card catalogs where only the initial word is searchable, it is important. Two- and three-
word headings are also formulated as nouns with explanatory qualifiers to ensure their 
correct interpretation, such as EQUILIBRIUM (ECONOMICS) and EQUILIBRIUM 
(PHYSIOLOGY). The qualifiers may distinguish disciplines or other kinds of sub-
ject matter, for example, TRANSITIONS (RHETORIC), TRANSITIONS (LASER), 
TRANSITIONS (METAL-INSULATOR), and TRANSITIONS (PRESIDENTIAL). 
</p>
<p> Another form consists of two nouns connected by a conjunction, such as &bdquo;AND,&permil; 
for example, ART AND BUSINESS. The nouns can represent similar things or op-
posites, for example, ART AND CAMOUFLAGE or GOOD AND EVIL. Complex 
headings in this category may include modified nouns, such as LANDSCAPE AR-
CHITECTURE AND ENERGY CONSERVATION. Prepositions are also used to link 
two nouns or modified nouns, for example, PRESENCE OF GOD and APPLICA-
TIONS FOR POSITIONS. 
</p>
<p> More complex headings can involve both multiword concepts and combinations 
of concepts, such as RIGHT AND LEFT (POLITICAL SCIENCE) IN MUSIC. Some-
times complex headings are simplified from edition to edition, for example, ERRATA </p>

<p>(IN BOOKS) was changed to ERRATA, and CONVENTS AND NUNNERIES, 
BUDDHIST to BUDDHIST CONVENTS. In other instances, LCSH revisions add 
to headings to clarify them or expand their scope, for example, some years ago PE-
TER&Ecirc;S DENIAL IN ART became JESUS CHRIST&middot;DENIAL BY PETER&middot;ART, 
and the one-word heading CLARET was changed to WINE AND WINE MAKING&middot;
FRANCE&middot;BORDELAIS. 
</p>
<p> LCSH headings and subject-heading strings are filed according to a set of rules 
that facilitates computerized filing, devised by John C. Rather. The system files word 
by word with digits preceding alphabetic characters, and it treats letter combinations 
as they appear (for example, &bdquo;Dr.&permil; files as &bdquo;D-r-period,&permil; not &bdquo;Doctor&permil;). LC&Ecirc;s filing 
rules distinguish between different kinds of subject heading forms and subdivisions, 
based on their computer coding. Recognition of heading and heading-and-subdivision 
forms is programmed into the computer systems that produce the printed LCSH. As 
a result, headings that consist of one word and this word plus subdivisions all appear 
before multiword headings beginning with the same word. Searchers need to know 
this because there can be many intervening headings (or pages of them in LCSH) be-
tween ART&middot;THEMES, MOTIVES (a subdivided heading) and ART AND SCIENCE 
(a multiword heading). The filing system appears to give preference to subdivided 
headings over multiword main headings. In filing subdivided headings, chronologi-
cal subdivisions are filed first, followed by topical subdivisions, and geographical 
subdivisions last. 
</p>
<p> Cross-References in LCSH 
</p>
<p> Six types of cross-references in LCSH are identified by standard mnemonic ab-
breviations mandated by the National Information Standards Organization: 
</p>
<p>  1. BT (Broader Term)&middot;one level higher in a hierarchy 
  2. RT (Related Term)&middot;same level of hierarchy 
  3. NT (Narrower Term)&middot;one level lower in a hierarchy 
  4. UF (Use For)&middot;authorized term 
  5. SA (See Also)&middot;reference to subject groups, not individual subject terms 
  6. USE&middot;unauthorized term 
</p>
<p> LCSH does not specify the highest term in a subject hierarchy, identified as TT 
(Top Term), nor does it show the entire hierarchy of a subject area from the broadest 
to the narrowest term, such as can be found in the National Library of Medicine&Ecirc;s 
 Medical Subject Headings .   Cross-references in LCSH show a maximum of three lev-
els of hierarchy for a subject heading: one level broader (BT) and one level narrower 
(NT). In practical terms, however, catalogers are instructed to display only NT refer-
ences in the catalog. The BT references are provided for consultation only. The RTs 
at the same level of hierarchy have reciprocal cross-references, and both are displayed 
in the catalog. 
</p>
<p> As the name implies, BTs lead from the heading at which they appear to broader 
headings in the same subject. This is called leading &bdquo;upward.&permil; Similarly, NTs lead to 
narrower terms in the same subject, called leading &bdquo;downward.&permil; RTs lead to head-
ings at the same level of hierarchy in a related area, which might be part of the same </p>

</p>
<p>subject or another subject associated with it. The relationships of these three types of 
cross-references to the heading at which they appear are clear from their names. 
</p>
<p> As shown in the previous list, SAs are references from the heading at which they 
appear to groups of headings, rather than individual headings. SAs may instruct cata-
logers to consult other headings or add headings and subdivisions that do not appear 
in the list. For example, at BOOKS, it says: &bdquo;SA  headings beginning with the word 
 Book&permil; and at COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS, it says, &bdquo;SA  names of individual prod-
ucts. &permil; Occasionally, catalogers are told to use the heading at which the SA appears as 
a subdivision under specific types of other headings, for example, at ART it says, &bdquo;SA 
subdivision ART under names of individual persons who lived before 1400, under 
names of deities and mythological or legendary figures, and under headings of the 
type [TOPIC]&middot;[SUBDIVISION] . . .&permil; Typically, terms used as subject headings 
may not be used as subdivisions, and vice versa. 
</p>
<p> UF and USE are reciprocal; that is, wherever a UF is made leading to an autho-
rized heading, a USE heading will appear at the target heading leading back to the 
original, unauthorized one. UFs appear at authorized headings, telling catalogers to 
make cross-references from unauthorized headings for a subject that searchers are 
likely to try. The reciprocal USE headings appear under the unauthorized headings 
and reveal which authorized headings to use instead for the subject. The two headings 
ACCELERATED EROSION (unauthorized) and SOIL EROSION (authorized) illus-
trate the point. ACCELERATED EROSION has a USE reference to SOIL EROSION; 
SOIL EROSION has a reciprocal UF for ACCELERATED EROSION. In practice, 
when the heading SOIL EROSION is first assigned, catalogers also make a cross-
reference for the UF heading ACCELERATED EROSION. When a searcher looks up 
ACCELERATED EROSION, which is a common term for the subject not authorized 
by LCSH, he or she finds the cross-reference to the authorized heading, &bdquo;USE SOIL 
EROSION.&permil; In the catalog display, the reference should look like this: 
</p>
<p> ACCELERATED EROSION.  Use  SOIL EROSION 
</p>
<p> The USE reference remains in the catalog until the last item on the subject SOIL 
EROSION is removed from the collection and that heading is removed. Accompany-
ing the removal of SOIL EROSION, the cross-reference ACCELERATED EROSION, 
which would then be unnecessary, is also removed. Otherwise, the cross-reference 
leads to a heading with no materials under it, known as a  blind reference.  Blind refer-
ences frustrate searchers because they fail to retrieve relevant materials. 
</p>
<p> Subdivisions in LCSH 
</p>
<p> LCSH has many subdivided headings throughout the list. Usually, one level of 
subdivision is sufficient to represent most topics in detail, but some headings require 
two, three, or even four levels of subdivision. 
</p>
<p> Subdivisions for a heading are listed following the cross-references for the head-
ing. As with an unsubdivided heading, each entry for a subdivided heading may have 
scope notes, classification numbers, and cross-references that pertain to that particular 
subdivision. Subdivisions are indented and printed with long dashes preceding them 
to indicate that they are not to be used alone, but only as subdivisions of the headings </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Library of Congress Subject Headings 361
</p>
<p>under which they appear. When a subdivided heading is, itself, subdivided further, 
which is necessary for very large topics that have several kinds of subdivisions (e.g., 
topical, chronological, and geographic), it is indented further and given additional 
dashes, one for each subdivision. For example, a topic such as the history of Chinese 
calligraphy in the 20th century would be expressed by the LCSH heading CALLIG-
RAPHY, CHINESE&middot;HISTORY&middot;20TH CENTURY, which is a two-level hierarchy; 
and a topic such as the attribution of Chinese calligraphy from the Sui dynasty would 
be expressed as CALLIGRAPHY, CHINESE&middot;HISTORY&middot;THREE KINGDOMS-
SUI DYNASTY, 220-618&middot;ATTRIBUTION, which is a three-level hierarchy. Fig-
ure 17.2 illustrates how they look in the printed LCSH.    
</p>
<p> Broad topics such as art, music, and science have numerous cross-references and 
subdivisions, some of which have their own subdivisions as well. This makes for con-
fusion in locating a particular subdivided heading, because it can be many columns or 
even a few pages away from the main heading. LCSH includes all these subdivisions 
because it is used to organize large collections of materials on topics about which 
much has been and is still being written. Dividing a huge file of catalog records by 
narrowing the topic, which is what subdivisions do, makes it easier for searchers to 
zero in on exactly what they seek and, simultaneously, makes the file smaller and 
quicker to search. 
</p>
<p> Three types of subdivisions predominate in LCSH: topical, chronological, and 
geographical. A fourth type, form or genre subdivisions, is also present in the list, but 
these terms can be construed as a special type of topical subdivision. Subdivisions are 
indicated in the list in several ways, so catalogers must be alert to all of them. Indi-
vidual subdivisions are assigned according to LC policies, given in  Subject Catalog-
ing Manual: Subject Headings.  Beginning catalogers should be aware that two main 
headings cannot be combined in a heading-subdivision relationship, unless one is 
listed specifically as a subdivision under the other, or unless one heading functions 
both as a main heading and a subdivision and is permitted as a subdivision under 
the second heading. Catalogers should not assume that the absence of an instruction 
 not  to subdivide is permission to do it. On the contrary&middot;if there is no clear indica-
tion of permission to subdivide a heading, it should not be subdivided. An important 
exception to the rule is the group of pattern headings listed in the preface to LCSH, 
discussed later. 
</p>
<p> Subdivisions for LCSH headings may be indicated in one of four ways: 
</p>
<p>  1. The subdivision appears in the list under the heading 
  2. An instruction to subdivide is given with the heading in the list 
  3. The heading fits into a designated pattern heading and can be subdivided 
</p>
<p>like it 
  4. The heading is a term to which free-floating subdivisions can be added 
</p>
<p>  Appears in the list:  The easiest and most straightforward method of providing 
for subdivisions is listing them under the headings to which they can be assigned, but 
doing so for all possible subdivisions would cause LCSH to expand far beyond its 
current size. Thus, although this method is used, alternatives are also used for reasons 
of economy and flexibility. 
</p>
<p>  Instruction appears with the heading:  When a heading can be subdivided geo-
graphically, this is usually noted by a parenthetic instruction  (May Subd Geog)  after </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Figure 17.2. Subdivisions in LCSH.
</p>
<p>the heading. If a subdivided heading can be further subdivided geographically, the 
same instruction will appear after the subdivision. The LC&Ecirc;s preferred method of sub-
dividing geographically is indirect. This means putting the name of a country after the 
heading being subdivided. Larger entities, such as continents or multicountry regions, 
are given the same way, but entities wholly within a country are preceded by the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Library of Congress Subject Headings 363
</p>
<p>name of the country in which they are located. In the example that follows, headings 
and their geographic subdivisions assigned to books about agriculture in North and 
South America, the Amazon Region, the Andes Mountains, the Andes Mountains of 
Venezuela, Argentina, Germany, Israel, and the cities of Buenos Aires and Munich 
are filed as follows: 
</p>
<p> AGRICULTURE&middot;AMAZON RIVER REGION 
 AGRICULTURE&middot;ANDES REGION 
 AGRICULTURE&middot;ARGENTINA 
 AGRICULTURE&middot;ARGENTINA&middot;BUENOS AIRES 
 AGRICULTURE&middot;GERMANY 
 AGRICULTURE&middot;GERMANY&middot;MUNICH 
 AGRICULTURE&middot;ISRAEL 
 AGRICULTURE&middot;NORTH AMERICA 
 AGRICULTURE&middot;SOUTH AMERICA 
 AGRICULTURE&middot;VENEZUELA&middot;ANDES REGION (VENEZUELA) 
</p>
<p> The resulting file gathers the geographic entities either at the country level or larger 
levels, but not at smaller levels, such as city or town levels. Localities can be browsed 
within their country files or found directly by requesting the desired place in a key-
word search. 
</p>
<p> Three countries&middot;the United States, Canada, and Great Britain&middot;have special 
rules for indirect subdivision. (Although  United Kingdom  is the proper name of the 
country and should be used in place of Great Britain, LCSH uses Great Britain be-
cause of the difficulty of making the change.) For these countries, the names of states, 
provinces, and constituent countries, respectively, are used. Materials on agriculture 
in Iowa City, education in London, and advertising in Toronto would be assigned the 
following subject headings: 
</p>
<p> AGRICULTURE&middot;IOWA&middot;IOWA CITY 
 EDUCATION&middot;ENGLAND&middot;LONDON 
 ADVERTISING&middot;ONTARIO&middot;TORONTO 
</p>
<p> Policies for geographic subdivision have changed over the years, sometimes fa-
voring direct subdivision, sometimes indirect, and sometimes accepting both depend-
ing on the country. New direct geographic subdivisions will not be established under 
the current policy, but older headings that were subdivided directly remain. The three 
exceptions gather records first at the state, province, or constituent country level be-
fore grouping them at the local level. Because much geographically distinctive mate-
rial in libraries is about these countries, this strategy avoids gathering huge numbers 
of records at the country level. 
</p>
<p>  Heading fits a designated pattern : Some topics serve as patterns for groups of 
related topics that can all be subdivided the same way. For example, PIANOS is the 
pattern for similar musical instruments. Any subdivision approved for PIANOS can 
be used to subdivide other keyboard instruments. Similarly, any subdivision approved 
for use with HEART can be assigned to other organs of the body. The list of topics 
designated as pattern headings is printed in the front matter of LCSH. (See additional 
details in the following section.) </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>364 17&mdash;Subject Authorities
</p>
<p>  Heading can be subdivided by free-floating subdivisions : LCSH has rules gov-
erning the types of subject headings to which its general subdivisions, known as 
&bdquo;free-floating subdivisions,&permil;   can be applied. Some of these general subdivisions are not 
appropriate under all possible main headings. If a main subject heading is of the type 
eligible for a particular free-floating subdivision, the subdivision can be added. For 
example, some free-floating subdivisions are approved for use with classes of persons 
and/or ethnic groups, others with places, still others with religions, and so on. Rules 
for free-floating subdivisions can be found in  Subject Cataloging Manual: Subject 
Headings  and  Cataloger&Ecirc;s Desktop . (See additional details in the following section.) 
</p>
<p> Other Subdivision Instructions 
</p>
<p>  Embedded instructions:  Instructions to use a particular topical heading as a sub-
division under other descriptors may be given with the heading in the list. For ex-
ample, in the scope note under RESEARCH, it says: &bdquo;Works on research about a 
particular region, country, etc. are entered under the name of the region, country, 
etc. with the subdivision Research.&permil; This means catalogers can add the subdivision 
&bdquo;&middot;RESEARCH&permil; at will to the names of regions, countries, or other geographic enti-
ties, as in the hypothetical heading NEW JERSEY&middot;RESEARCH. 
</p>
<p>  Pattern headings:  LCSH&Ecirc;s creators identify 23 groups of headings as  pattern 
headings.  Each member of a pattern-heading group might need the same set of sub-
divisions, but instead of repeating the whole set under each one, one heading is fully 
subdivided in the list and catalogers are instructed to use the same pattern for all the 
others in the same category. For example, all plants and crops can be subdivided with 
the same terms as those given under CORN and all sacred works can be subdivided 
exactly like BIBLE. For some heading groups, more than one pattern is provided; for 
example, subdivision of diseases may either follow the pattern under CANCER or 
the one under TUBERCULOSIS. Pattern headings are listed in the printed edition 
of LCSH. 
</p>
<p>  Free-floating subdivisions:  Some subdivisions&middot;all topical terms, a number of 
them representing literary forms&middot;are designated as  free-floating.  These have such 
widespread potential for use as subdivisions that it is difficult to anticipate and list 
them all. Instead, they can be assigned with a broad range of headings. The list of free-
floating subdivisions appears in the 31st edition of LCSH, in the online version, and 
in a printed booklet. Detailed guidance on how to assign free-floating subdivision 
terms is given in the booklet and the  Subject Cataloging Manual: Subject Headings.  
</p>
<p>  Form/Genre subdivisions:  Form and genre subdivisions, mentioned previously in 
connection with the list of free-floating terms, include terms that describe the format 
in which a work appears, such as &bdquo;&middot;CATALOGS&permil;. This group of terms also includes 
literary genres, such as &bdquo;&middot;DICTIONARIES&permil; and &bdquo;&middot;BIOGRAPHIES&permil;. Most form 
subdivisions are free-floating. ALA&Ecirc;s SAC committee and the LC have been expanding 
the use of form and genre subdivisions as well as form and genre headings. The trend 
is to be more liberal in establishing and assigning such headings and subdivisions, be-
cause users want them and computerized searching makes them practical to use. 
</p>
<p>  Chronological subdivisions:  Chronological subdivisions, most of which are not 
free-floating, are almost always given in the list of terms for those subject headings 
and subdivisions that may be subdivided by period. History is frequently subdivided </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Library of Congress Subject Headings 365
</p>
<p>by time period, and historical topics often are specific to particular places. The intro-
ductory explanations warn catalogers not to use the historical periods developed for 
one place under other places, for example, it would not be appropriate to use chrono-
logical periods for Japan under India or China. Each country, state, or province has its 
own chronological landmarks. However, general chronological periods that can apply 
to many topics, such as the names of the centuries, appear both as main headings and 
subdivisions that can be used under other headings. 
</p>
<p>  Topical subdivisions:  Topical subdivision is exactly what the name implies: a 
subdivision that represents a topic, such as COMPUTERS&middot;CIRCUITS. CIRCUITS, 
the subdivision, does not represent a geographical, chronological, or form subdivision. 
It is a topical subdivision, but it cannot be used just anywhere, as the free-floating 
subdivisions can. If it were not listed as an authorized subdivision under COMPUT-
ERS, catalogers could not create it. They would have to use COMPUTERS alone or 
use two headings to embody the concept. 
</p>
<p> Because subdivision is done only as LC directs, uniform strings of headings and 
subdivisions are created that can be combined in only one way. ARCHITECTURE&middot;
ARID REGIONS and ARID REGIONS&middot;ARCHITECTURE may mean the same 
thing, but LCSH only authorizes the former as a subject heading. Catalogers examin-
ing both terms will find&middot;ARID REGIONS listed as a subdivision under ARCHI-
TECTURE but no listing for &bdquo;&middot;ARCHITECTURE&permil; as a subdivision under ARID 
REGIONS. This happens because LCSH is  precoordinated.  
</p>
<p> LCSH&rsquo;s Canadian Complement 
</p>
<p> The differences in the sociopolitical structure between Canada and the United 
States and an in-depth arrangement of Canadian history are obvious areas where sub-
ject headings suitable to a Canadian topic are needed.  Canadian Subject Headings  
(CSH), published by the Library and Archives Canada (LAC), is a list of English-
language subject headings, compatible with   LCSH, that is used to access and express 
the subject content of documents on Canada and Canadian topics. It is no longer 
published in a paper format and has been superseded by  CSH on the Web,  a free, up-
to-date listing of more than 6,000 English-language subject authority records (http://
www.collectionscanada.ca/csh/index-e.html). The records are available in both the 
machine-readable cataloging (MARC 21) format and thesaurus display. (MARC for-
mats will be discussed in chapter 19). There is a monthly list of new and revised 
headings and an alphabetical list of subdivisions. The database is updated monthly 
and provides a large number of references, scope notes, and instructions setting topics 
in their Canadian context. The list of subdivisions provides French-language equiva-
lents and the database provides a link to  R&eacute;pertoire de vedettes-mati&egrave;re  for equivalent 
French-language headings. Subject authority records for  Canadian Subject Headings  
are also available in the AMICUS database. Registered AMICUS users can download 
CSH authority records in the MARC 21 format from AMICUS. (Although users must 
register to obtain entry to the AMICUS database, its use is free of charge.) 
</p>
<p> CSH is neither a comprehensive list nor a substitute for LCSH. It is to be used for 
items containing Canadian subject matter, whereas LCSH is to be applied to all other 
materials. CSH&Ecirc;s headings and references expand and adapt LCSH where Canadian 
topics are not adequately covered or where LCSH headings are not acceptable in a </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Canadian context. &bdquo;MUMMERS&permil; in Figure 14.15 on page 287   is an example of a 
subject heading not found in LCSH. 
</p>
<p> LAC may consult the Canadian Committee on Cataloguing and the cataloging 
community on major policy directions for CSH. In addition, LAC has been contribut-
ing new subject concepts identified in Canadian publications to LCSH since 1994. 
LC uses CSH as a basic source when considering new headings. 
</p>
<p> Problems with LCSH 
</p>
<p> Until recently, LCSH evolved very slowly. Critics, such as the late Sanford Berman, 
who spearheaded valuable initiatives to improve LC subject headings, claimed that 
LC policy makers were too stubborn in resisting needed changes in its spelling and 
terminology. In theory, LCSH is constantly being revised, and catalogers are able to 
propose new or altered headings at any time. 
</p>
<p> In any list this large, a slow pace of change is understandable. LC has many more 
items cataloged under any one heading than small libraries do; therefore, the num-
ber of operations needed to update LC records when a change is made to an existing 
heading is considerable, running into many thousands for headings also used as sub-
divisions. As a result, there is sometimes a reluctance to change headings. For ex-
ample, for many years, subject catalogers at LC resisted eliminating the now obsolete 
heading NEGROES, even though they acknowledged that common usage had in-
vested the word with pejorative connotations. Eventually, it was dropped in favor of 
AFRICAN AMERICANS and BLACKS (BLACKS refers to black people who are 
not American). Similarly, LC resisted changing MOVING PICTURES to MOTION 
PICTURES until 1989, which necessitated the change of many derivative headings 
following the form [TOPIC] IN MOTION PICTURES. In the 1990s, however, the 
conversion of LC&Ecirc;s catalog records and authority files to online form was completed. 
This has speeded up the process of change. Greater flexibility in revising old headings 
and introducing new ones is an encouraging change in the status quo. 
</p>
<p> Selected problems of LCSH have been and are still being addressed by the Sub-
ject Analysis Committee (SAC), a standing committee of the Cataloging and Classi-
fication Section of the Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services. The 
committee appoints and maintains subcommittees and task forces, each devoted to a 
particular problem or issue. Members are appointed on the basis of their interest and 
expertise, and their reports are instrumental in adding new headings to LCSH, chang-
ing older ones, or modifying its application policies. In the recent past, SAC lobbied 
LC successfully to revise terms with negative connotations and terms for groups of 
people that offended those they identified. SAC also has subcommittees charged with 
exploring faceted access and genre and form subject headings, several of which (e.g., 
those studying genre terms for maps and videorecordings) submitted reports while 
this chapter was being written that greatly expand the use of such headings. 
</p>
<p> Other groups have also successfully lobbied LC to create needed headings. Some 
have created their own thesauri to augment or supplement LCSH. The idea of using 
more than one subject authority in a library&Ecirc;s catalog, once thought impossible, is an 
accepted option today. Terms from alternative thesauri are accommodated in the 
MARC encoding system. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Library of Congress Subject Headings 367
</p>
<p> LCSH has informative scope notes and instructions for the application of nu-
merous subject headings and is adding more. Nonetheless, with so many headings 
appearing over such a long period of time, overlaps are inevitable, for example, CON-
FORMITY and COMPLIANCE; COMPUTERS, ELECTRONIC DIGITAL COM-
PUTERS, MINICOMPUTERS, and MICROCOMPUTERS (but no heading appears 
for &bdquo;mainframes,&permil; not even as a cross-reference). LC makes fine distinctions between 
headings that can be missed by searchers unfamiliar with its terminology. For ex-
ample, AFRICAN AMERICANS and BLACKS differ only in whether the specified 
people are American citizens or not. Specialists who work with LCSH are aware of 
the difference, but users searching the catalog may not be. 
</p>
<p> LC&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s and Young Adults&rsquo; Cataloging Program 
</p>
<p> In 1965, LC responded to requests on the part of librarians working with children 
and youth for subject-heading modifications for children&Ecirc;s materials by initiating its 
Annotated Card (AC) program, now titled the Children&Ecirc;s and Young Adults&Ecirc; Cataloging 
program. Four modifications were made to the materials treated under the program: 
</p>
<p>  1. Subdivisions referring to age level, such as &bdquo;&middot;JUVENILE LITERA-
TURE,&permil; were dropped. 
</p>
<p>  2. Selected terms were added, revised, or simplified. 
  3. Subdivision practice was altered. 
  4. Summaries were added in the descriptive cataloging to inform searchers 
</p>
<p>about the content of the materials (hence the term &bdquo;annotated&permil;). 
</p>
<p> Examples of children&Ecirc;s and young adults&Ecirc; cataloging headings that differ slightly 
from LCSH are ALPINE ANIMALS, which is used instead of LCSH&Ecirc;s ALPINE 
FAUNA, and BEDWETTING, which is used instead of LCSH&Ecirc;s ENURESIS. Clearly, 
&bdquo;animals&permil; and &bdquo;bedwetting&permil; are recognized and understood by youngsters more eas-
ily than &bdquo;fauna&permil; and &bdquo;enuresis,&permil; respectively. In other instances, the modification is 
subtler; for example, ROBOTS is used in the CYACP program for materials about 
androids and other kinds of robots, while ANDROIDS is used for adult materials 
specifically about that particular type of robot. Two important modifications in subdi-
vision practice are the use of &bdquo;&middot;BIOGRAPHY&permil; for individual biographies in subject 
fields, where LCSH lacks the term for persons in the field, and &bdquo;&middot;FICTION,&permil; which 
can be added to all topical headings. 
</p>
<p> The list of Children&Ecirc;s Subject Headings in the printed edition of LCSH immedi-
ately precedes the regular adult list and is similar to it, three columns to a page, with 
scope notes, cross-references, geographic subdivision instructions, and subdivisions, 
but without classification numbers. In cataloging-in-publication (CIP) data, CYACP 
headings are assigned in addition to, not in place of, adult headings. The headings ap-
pear in square brackets following the adult headings and the term &bdquo;AC&permil; is often noted 
at the end of the record. In online catalogs, CYACP headings are encoded differently 
than adult headings. Summaries appear in the note area of the descriptive cataloging. 
Figure 17.3 illustrates these differences.    </p>

<p>Sears List of Subject Headings 369
</p>
<p> SEARS LIST OF SUBJECT HEADINGS 
</p>
<p>  Sears List of Subject Headings  (Sears) was initiated by its original compiler, Min-
nie Earl Sears, in response to requests from librarians for subject headings that were 
simpler to understand and assign than those in LCSH. Publisher H. W. Wilson, which 
printed and sold catalog cards to small school and public libraries at that time, first 
published the Sears list in 1923 under Ms. Sears editorship, and adopted Sears subject 
headings for its cards. This ensured that the Sears list would have a substantial market. 
</p>
<p> Minnie Earl Sears recognized the value of maintaining a uniform structure be-
tween LCSH and her list. That uniform structure made it possible to coordinate terms 
from both lists. If Sears lacked a heading wanted by a cataloger, he or she could turn 
to LCSH for it and add it without fear of conflict. If a small library grew large enough 
that the Sears headings were no longer effective, it could move to LCSH. Minnie Earl 
Sears did not find the LCSH structure unacceptable, but its terms tended to be too 
technical for novice searchers and too specific for smaller institutions with limited 
collections of materials. The small size and simple terminology of the Sears list ap-
pealed to catalogers who found LCSH difficult to learn to use. The similarities be-
tween Sears and LCSH are demonstrated in comparing the Sears subject headings 
WEALTH and WEAPONS in Figure 17.4 with those LCSH headings in Figure 17.1. 
A comparison of the subject heading CALLIGRAPHY in Figure 17.2 (LCSH) and in 
Figure 17.5 (Sears) demonstrates LCSH&Ecirc;s greater range of specificity.

<p> Although H. W. Wilson ended its commercial card-distribution service many years 
ago, it continues to update Sears for its customers. Until 1988, new editions of Sears 
appeared more often than new editions of LCSH. Since then, LCSH has become an 
annual whereas H. W. Wilson issues new editions of Sears less often, but more fre-
quently than it did in the 20th century. For example, the two editions that preceded 
the 19th edition (Sears 19), published in 2007 and current at this writing, appeared in 
2000 and 2004. Joseph Miller, the principal editor of the this edition, and his associate 
editor Barbara A. Bristow, are only the fifth and sixth persons in the series of editors 
who followed Minnie Earl Sears. 
</p>
<p>  Sears List of Subject Headings: Canadian Companion,  6th edition, (CC6) edited 
by Lynne Lighthall1 provides headings for items containing Canadian subject matter. 
A new edition of SearsCC has not been published because its editor believes there is 
not enough new material to warrant publication. 
</p>
<p> Libraries with significant collections of Canadian materials should continue to 
use CC6 and Sears 19 because some of the subject headings in Sears 19 have a U.S. 
orientation not suited to Canadian materials. For example Sears 19 uses the term 
&bdquo; Native Americans&mdash;Canada &permil; with a USE reference from &bdquo;First Nations,&permil; the term 
Canadian Native peoples that are not Inuit have chosen for their name. Those libraries 
that wish to be politically correct should assign &bdquo; Native Americans&mdash;Canada &permil; only 
to works that deal with both the First Nations and Inuit peoples and assign the sub-
ject heading &bdquo; First Nations &permil; and the qualifier &bdquo; First Nations people, &permil; for example, 
&bdquo; Haida (First Nations people) &permil; to works that used to be listed under the discarded 
heading &bdquo;Indians of North America&middot;Canada.&permil; 
</p>
<p> Examples of other differences that reflect Canadian usage are &bdquo; French-speaking 
Canadians &permil; (CC6) rather than &bdquo; French Canadians &permil; (Sears 19) and &bdquo; Quebec </p>

History-Autonomy and independence movements &permil; (Sears 19). Sears 19 reflects 
the cross-border difference in attitude toward the War of 1812, which each side claims 
it won. The Sears 19&Ecirc;s UF and BT references ignore Canada&Ecirc;s role in the war despite 
the fact that there were battles on Canadian soil. Libraries with collections of Cana-
dian materials should establish Canadian-oriented UFs and BTs. A different Dewey 
number (971.03) should be assigned in Canadian libraries and to those works about 
the War of 1812 written from a Canadian perspective that rather than the one in Sears 
18 that applies to U.S. history (973.5). 
</p>
<p> The Publication 
</p>
<p> Sears subject headings are contained in one large volume. The headings and 
references are listed in 823 pages having two columns to a page (see Figure 17.5). </p>

<p>Sears List of Subject Headings 371
</p>
<p>The publisher describes Sears as having &bdquo;more than 8,000 established subject terms 
and copious provisions for establishing further terms as needed,&permil; and more than 500 
authorized subdivisions.2 
</p>
<p>  Sears List of Subject Headings  is available to subscribers online via WilsonWeb. 
At this writing, reports say that a 2009 update to the 19th edition of  Sears List of Sub-
ject Headings    is to be available for electronic users in MARC 21 authority format. 
New headings added in both the 2008 and the 2009 updates are included in the Sears 
database online and are to be included in the 20th edition. 
</p>
<p> Sears begins with an extensive introductory chapter giving a brief history, a de-
scription of the principles on which it is based, instructions for applying the head-
ings, and a bibliography of basic sources for more information. Following this are 
explanations of headings to be added by the cataloger, key headings (equivalent to 
LCSH&Ecirc;s pattern headings), and a list of canceled and replacement headings. The list

</p>
<p>of changed headings expedites identifying specific revisions that should be made in 
the catalog when adopting the new edition. 
</p>
<p> The 19th edition includes very few changes. Some of the changes are minor, 
such as the replacement of  Super Bowl  with  Super Bowl (Game) . Others are more 
far-reaching, such as the replacement of  Native peoples  with  Indigenous peoples . 
The former change involves only adding a qualifier to clarify the context of the term, 
whereas the latter change alters the words used for the concept and shifts the subject 
file from the &bdquo;Ns&permil; to the &bdquo;Is.&permil; A few changes are still more extensive, such as the change 
from  Libraries and students  to  Students&mdash;Library services . Though the heading 
still contains three words, the new heading is filed far from its previous location and 
its syntax has changed. Now the words are arranged in a &bdquo;main heading&middot;subdivision 
form&permil; in place of two nouns connected by &bdquo;and.&permil; The changed heading seems to re-
flect a shift in focus from institutions to people. This kind of conceptual shift was 
once difficult to implement, because of the time and cost of unfiling, altering, and 
refiling cards, but computerized catalogs minimize those practical problems. 
</p>
<p> A section titled &bdquo;The Use of Subdivisions in the Sears List&permil; introduces and 
briefly explains a flexible system of subdivision practice. It is followed by a list of 
all words used as subdivisions for which Sears has specific provisions. These terms 
also appear in the main list, where some are authorized for use both as main headings 
and subdivisions, and others are authorized for use solely as subdivisions. To find the 
instructions for a particular subdivision, catalogers must search it in the main list. 
</p>
<p> Format of the Entries 
</p>
<p> Authorized headings always appear in boldface type, whether they are main head-
ings or cross-references under other main headings. Roman print is used for terms 
not authorized for use as headings but included as cross-references. For example, 
 Carnivorous plants  appears in boldface print as a main heading in the &bdquo;Cs,&permil; while 
Insect-eating plants appears in roman print under it. In the &bdquo;I&permil; section, Insect-eating 
plants appears in the main list in roman print with the cross-reference instruction to 
&bdquo;USE  Carnivorous plants &permil; following it in boldface. 
</p>
<p> In addition to the subject headings and cross-references, many of the headings 
have suggested classification numbers, taken from the 14th edition of  Abridged Dewey 
Decimal Classification and Relative Index  (DDC-Abridged).   When a subject has 
more than one viewpoint, two or more classification numbers may be suggested for 
the topic, depending on which viewpoint is represented in an item.   For example,  Files 
and filing  is given three numbers, 005.74, 025.3, and 651.5, depending on whether 
the focus is computers, library catalogs, or business management. The editors explain 
that Dewey numbers are not assigned to very general topics and are deliberately kept 
short, but can be extended using subdivision numbers in Dewey Decimal Classifi-
cation tables. They also caution catalogers against using the numbers without first 
examining them in DDC-Abridged. 
</p>
<p> Some headings are followed by instructions on how to apply or subdivide them 
as well as how not to use them and what alternatives are acceptable. For instance, 
under the heading  Film adaptations , the instruction states: &bdquo;Use for individual 
works, collections, or materials about film adaptations of material from other media.&permil; 
Under  Drama , it says &bdquo;Use for general materials on drama, not for individual works. </p>

</p>
<p>Materials on the history and criticism of drama as literature are entered under  
Drama &middot; History and criticism.  Materials on the presentation of plays are entered 
under  Acting; Amateur theater;  or  Theater &middot; Production and direction.  Collections 
of plays are entered under  Drama &middot; Collections; American drama &middot; Collections; 
English drama &middot; Collections;  and so on and adds under the SA reference, &bdquo;S[ee] 
A[lso] subjects, historical events, names of countries, cities, etc., ethnic groups, 
classes of persons, and names of individual persons with the subdivision  Drama,  to 
express the theme or subject content of collections of plays, e.g.  Easter &middot; Drama; 
United States &middot; History &middot; 1861&ndash;1865, Civil War &middot; Drama; Napoleon I, Emperor 
of the French, 1769&ndash;1821 &middot; Drama;  etc. [to be added as needed].&permil; The instructions 
may include information about when  not  to use a heading and furnish alternatives for 
similar works with different emphases. 
</p>
<p> Sears, like LCSH, does not list personal names and other proper nouns or the 
names of particular animals, plants, or diseases, and so on that would be difficult to 
anticipate and include in the list. Instructions allow catalogers to add these headings 
as needed. 
</p>
<p> Subject headings in Sears are arranged according to the 1980 edition of filing rules 
sponsored by ALA. These rules, based on the principle of filing subject headings as 
they appear and ignoring all punctuation, were simplified from a more complicated 
version published in 1968. The current rules facilitate automated filing in computer-
ized catalogs. Subject headings are now filed word by word with digits preceding 
letters, and punctuation is ignored. Figure 17.6, shows a list of hypothetical subject 
headings filed by these rules.    
</p>
<p> All multiword headings appear in natural order, that is, in the order they would 
be spoken. Inverted terms were eliminated from Sears years ago. The few that still 
appear in the list, such as Children, Abnormal, are there solely as cross-references. 
The use of natural order and the rule of ignoring punctuation in filing disperses some 
headings more closely related to one another than to those filed next to them, but it is 
a boon to users who do not have to remember that different types of punctuation have 
special meanings.

<p> Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Sears 
</p>
<p> Many of Sears&Ecirc; features are the same as or very similar to the features of LCSH. 
What advantages are to be gained from adopting it? What disadvantages must be con-
sidered in doing so? 
</p>
<p> The main advantage of adopting Sears derives from its vocabulary, which is 
smaller, simpler, and broader than the vocabulary of LCSH and, therefore, better tai-
lored to the language levels and searching skills of young people and adults whose 
knowledge of subjects is general. Another advantage is that a larger number of ma-
terials are brought together by the broad headings in Sears than would be collocated 
using LCSH&Ecirc;s narrower headings. Users of libraries and media centers with small 
collections benefit from the larger average number of retrievals Sears provides, which 
increases the possibility that searchers will find what they seek among them. When 
other members of a school district or public library group use Sears, conforming to that 
choice makes sense if the group shares a single catalog, orders cataloging from the 
same vendor, or offers shared products and services. 
</p>
<p> The main disadvantage of adopting Sears is that it limits the number of sources 
from which a local library or media center can derive its cataloging. One important 
source of cataloging copy for small agencies&middot;CIP&middot;does not provide Sears headings. 
Catalogers can use the LCSH headings in CIP as suggestions, but they must still look 
up and assign the Sears subject headings to all the materials they buy, not just materi-
als that lack CIP. In addition, just because a larger number of titles can be retrieved 
using Sears headings does not mean all of them are equally relevant to the searcher. 
In subject areas where a library collects heavily, narrower headings that differentiate 
similar materials and group them into smaller sets might be more appropriate. 
</p>
<p> Striking a balance among competing goals&middot;accommodating language needs, 
achieving optimal specificity, conforming to peer choices, minimizing costs, and maxi-
mizing potential sources for cataloging copy&middot;is never easy. User needs should take 
priority, but practical matters cannot be ignored. Consulting with users, information 
service staff, and cataloging staff can help with these decisions. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> LCSH remains the subject heading list in widest use among U.S. and Canadian 
libraries despite its problems and idiosyncrasies. The general growth of collections in 
the past several decades has turned small libraries into larger ones, and that growth has 
generated a need for a larger list of more specific subject headings. In small libraries 
and media centers, Sears is used quite often. However, because CIP records always 
contain LCSH headings and network records almost always contain them, many librar-
ians and media specialists have had to rethink their adherence to Sears. On the other 
hand, when all the small libraries in a group use Sears, it is logical to use it also. 
</p>
<p> There is no requirement that narrow headings be used when broader ones will 
do an acceptable job. If a library has only a few books on a subject, a cataloger can 
decide not to distinguish them and put them all under one broad heading. These deci-
sions should be based on a clear idea of how the collection will grow in the future. If 
a library has small collections that are unlikely to grow much larger, Sears headings 
might be applied instead of LCSH, because they are broader. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Notes 375
</p>
<p> Subject headings must gather enough material so that someone looking under a 
particular heading will find most of the holdings of the library or media center rel-
evant to that topic. At the same time, they must not bring together too many items or 
the file is rendered useless to all but the most persistent searchers. If a library uses a 
cataloging network as its source for cataloging data, decisions must also weigh the 
cost of changing headings on derived cataloging against putting up with retrieval that 
is less than ideal. Maintaining a local subject authority file to manage unique prac-
tices has costs that generally outweigh the benefits. 
</p>
<p> The delicate balance between gathering and distinguishing materials by subject 
shifts according to the needs of individual groups of materials and individual search-
ers. The best the cataloger can do is to try to please  most  of the searchers  most  of the 
time, while working toward an ideal subject catalog in which all users find exactly 
what they need under whatever headings they use.

<p>18  Classifi cation Systems 
</p>
<p> A place for everything and everything in its place. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Isabella Mary Beeton 
</p>
<p> To arrange a library is to practice / in a quiet and modest way / the art of 
criticism. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Jorge Luis Borges 
</p>
<p> The two most popular classification systems used in North America to arrange 
library materials on the shelves are the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and the 
Library of Congress Classification (LCC). They are described in this chapter, along 
with the National Library of Medicine Classification (NLMC), a specialized system 
that is used in practice with LCC. The classification numbers assigned to materials 
are the part of their call numbers that reflects the subject content of the materials. By 
assigning the same or similar classification numbers to material on a topic, browsers 
find them gathered together on the shelves for easy access. 
</p>
<p> DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION 
</p>
<p> The DDC is a universal, enumerative, hierarchical classification system. Its pub-
lisher, OCLC/Forest Press, claims it is the most popular classification system in the 
world. DDC is widely used in public and school libraries in the United States and Can-
ada, and by these and other types of libraries in more than 100 other countries. The 
Library and Archives Canada (LAC) uses DDC to classify its collection. It is the basis 
for arrangement of the  British National Bibliography  and other national bibliographic 
agencies in the Commonwealth and elsewhere. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>380 18&mdash;Classification Systems
</p>
<p> Seven principles underlie the organization and structure of DDC: 
</p>
<p>  1.  Decimal division.  Division by 10s is the primary method used by DDC. 
All knowledge is first divided into 10 main classes. Each main class is 
subsequently subdivided into 10 more subclasses, and so on, theoreti-
cally, ad infinitum .  It is a simple, familiar, and useful method of divid-
ing&middot;something people think of as round numbers. At the same time, 
this form of division is at the root of some of the system&Ecirc;s most troubling 
limitations. 
</p>
<p>  2.  Classification by discipline.  The primary attribute applied in dividing 
knowledge is subject discipline, represented by the 10 main classes. That 
may seem natural to readers of this book, because it is so familiar to most 
librarians, but it is not the only possibility. Knowledge could, for instance, 
be divided first by a different element, such as time period or geographic 
location, and only after that, by discipline, genre, or form, and other 
attributes. 
</p>
<p>  3.  Hierarchy.  The principle of moving from broad categories to narrower 
ones and from these to still narrower ones until reaching the narrowest 
one possible is often encountered in classification, but DDC emphasizes 
it and uses it in creating complex numbers. Ideally, the hierarchy built 
into DDC numbers identifies topics at the same level and clarifies which 
are broader and narrower merely by counting the total number of digits 
in the class. In practice, this works only part of the time, because all 
topical areas do not divide neatly into 10 elements. In areas such as lit-
erature, a number with three digits (e.g., 813, American fiction) can be 
at the same level as a number with five (e.g.,, Russian fiction, 891.43) 
or more. 
</p>
<p>  4.  Mnemonics.  Melvil Dewey liked time-saving devices and incorporated 
as many as he could into his classification. Specific groups of numbers 
may represent the same topic in many places in the classification. An ex-
ample is the number &bdquo;-73,&permil; which stands for United States in geography 
(917.3), cookery (641.5973), political parties (324.273), etc. However, it 
doesn&Ecirc;t always work; for example, the number 730 stands for sculpture. 
</p>
<p>  5.  Literary warrant.  This principle dictates that classes are created only 
after materials exist that require them. The DDC purports to be a clas-
sification of all knowledge, and it does an outstanding job of including 
topics. However, no classification of limited size can anticipate or list 
all topics. When new knowledge emerges, new numbers are created to 
accommodate them. &bdquo;Computers&permil; is a good example of a topic that was 
added when the need for it became clear. In the 19th and earlier editions 
of DDC, computers occupied a tiny category (001.64) under the larger 
topic of &bdquo;Research&permil; (001). In the 20th edition, computers expanded to 
occupy three newly established sections of their own (004  &ndash;  006). 
</p>
<p>  6.  Enumeration.  This principle dictates listing complete class numbers in 
contrast to listing components (facets) of numbers that must be put to-
gether (or synthesized) to build complex topics. Enumeration generally 
guides DDC, but recent editions incorporate more instances of number </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Dewey Decimal Classification 381
</p>
<p>building because it is more economical of page space and allows for 
greater flexibility. Expansion of many subject areas in recent years would 
require many more enumerated numbers to represent them, whereas in-
structions to copy existing expansion techniques does not. 
</p>
<p>  7.  Relative location.  At one time in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere, 
library books were shelved in fixed locations. Once an item was given its 
place on the shelves, it was never moved, no matter what new materials 
were added to the collection. The DDC assumes that as new books are 
added and shelved, existing items will be moved to maintain their subject 
relationships. The DDC number merely identifies a place relative to other 
items in the collection. 
</p>
<p> None of these principles operates perfectly throughout DDC. They are observed 
as far as possible when they do not conflict, create unwanted juxtapositions of subjects, 
or interfere with practical considerations. Enumeration is abandoned to save space, 
mnemonics are superseded, and other principles may be modified when it is important 
to do so. Nevertheless, the principles govern many of the decisions made by DDC&Ecirc;s 
editors with regard to class numbers and relationships. 
</p>
<p> An eighth principle&middot;integrity of numbers&middot;was promised by Melvil Dewey to 
DDC users in the classification&Ecirc;s early days. Numbers assigned to represent a particu-
lar topic were expected to remain stable and not change. Number changes create work 
in a library keeping all of its materials shelved in a consistent, up-to-date manner. At 
the least, call-number labels and markings in or on materials must be changed, catalog 
records must be altered to display new call numbers, and materials must be moved 
to their new locations. However, as knowledge grows and changes over time, main-
taining accurate relationships among subjects requires changing the existing numbers 
despite the promise. From time to time, entire spans of numbers have been altered to 
reflect profound changes in a subject area in a practice called &bdquo;phoenixing.&permil; A phoe-
nixed schedule was one that was discarded and rebuilt from scratch (rising from its 
ashes, like the mythical bird). At some points in DDC&Ecirc;s history, users have rebelled 
at having to absorb too many changes, so in recent years, DDC&Ecirc;s editors have used 
the milder term &bdquo;complete revision&permil; for revised number spans, and the practice was 
modified, though not entirely abandoned. In recent years, to provide as much stability 
as possible, complete revisions have been kept to a minimum and revised schedules 
have been given extensive testing before being published. 
</p>
<p> Format of DDC 
</p>
<p> The DDC may be purchased in book form in full or abridged editions, or as an 
online subscription. An outline of the classification, consisting of its three summaries 
(10 main classes, 100 divisions, and 1,000 sections), which appears at the beginning 
of the second volume of the unabridged print edition, is available free of charge on 
the DDC Web site, www.oclc.org/dewey. 
</p>
<p> At the time of this writing, the printed version of unabridged DDC is in its 22nd 
edition. The book version is in four volumes totaling more than 4,000 pages.1 The first 
volume includes the usual introductory information: a brief background of the clas-
sification, a list of numbers that have changed from the previous edition, a user manual </p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>to guide classifiers in assigning numbers, and six auxiliary tables of subdivisions to be 
added to numbers from the main schedules. The schedules themselves are enumerated 
in the second and third volumes. The Relative Index appears in the fourth volume. 
</p>
<p> The online version of DDC, called WebDewey (www.oclc.org/dewey/versions/
webdewey), includes all the content from DDC 22 as well as ongoing quarterly up-
dates (new developments, new &bdquo;built&permil; numbers, and additional electronic index terms), 
updated mappings to Edition 22 numbers in the areas of computer science and law, 
thousands of headings from  Library of Congress Subject Headings  (LCSH) that have 
been statistically mapped to DDC numbers from records in the OCLC Online Union 
Catalog, thousands of Relative Index terms and built numbers not available in print, 
links from mapped LCSH to the LCSH authority records, and selected mappings from 
the National Library of Medicine&Ecirc;s  Medical Subject Headings  (MeSH). WebDewey 
also includes optional Dewey Cutter Software that automatically provides cutter num-
bers from the OCLC Four-Figure Cutter Tables (Cutter Four-Figure Table and Cutter-
Sanborn Four-Figure Table). 
</p>
<p> The principal advantages of the electronic version over the book version, aside 
from computerized retrieval, are the inclusion of frequently used LCSH subject head-
ings associated with a classification number; the ability to verify a classification number 
assignment by sampling a catalog record that uses the number drawn from the OCLC 
database; a popular, easy-to-use &bdquo;windowed&permil; user interface; cut-and-paste functions 
that help minimize keying; online help screens; and an introductory tutorial. 
</p>
<p> The Relative Index was Melvil Dewey&Ecirc;s original contribution to classification. 
Its great value lies in bringing together all aspects of a topic under the term used to 
represent it no matter where the topic would be classified. For example, topics relating 
to music are located in the music schedule (780&ndash;789), but music therapy is found in 
medicine (610s), music in literature is in the 800s, and music in art is in the 700s (but 
not 780&ndash;789). The Relative Index does more than just list topics in alphabetical order 
with their associated class numbers. It brings together the different contexts in which 
a single topical term might be used and the different disciplines in which a single topic 
might be found. 
</p>
<p> The DDC abridged edition2 is suitable for very small general collections, defined 
by OCLC-Forest Press as collections totaling 20,000 volumes or less. The abridged 
edition contains about one-tenth as many numbers as the unabridged edition, rarely dis-
playing numbers longer than five digits. At the time of this writing, the abridged version 
is in its 14th edition, published in one volume of approximately 1,000 pages. Numbers 
in the abridged edition, while broader in meaning and shorter in length, are compatible 
with those in the unabridged edition. 
</p>
<p> The Schedules 
</p>
<p> The DDC&Ecirc;s main classes, based to some degree on an inversion of Sir Francis 
Bacon&Ecirc;s classification of knowledge (philosophy, expanded to cover most of the mod-
ern disciplines, poetry, and history), include the following: 
</p>
<p> 000  =  Generalities 
 100  =  Philosophy 
 200  =  Religion </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Dewey Decimal Classification 383
</p>
<p> 300  =  Social Sciences 
 400  =  Language 
 500  =  Pure Science 
 600  =  Technology 
 700  =  Arts 
 800  =  Literature 
 900  =  Geography and History 
</p>
<p> By covering knowledge in only 10 main classes, DDC forces some odd compan-
ions into a single class. For example, in the 100s, philosophy, psychology, and the oc-
cult are grouped together. Statistics, etiquette, commerce, and war share the 300s with 
sociology, economics, political science, law, and education. The 700s, primarily cover-
ing the arts, also include sports and games. Geography and history are grouped together 
in the 900s in one huge main class, even though they are quite different topics. One 
might expect to find library science with the social sciences or education, but instead it 
is located in the 000s (read this as  zero hundreds ) along with research, publishing, and 
other generalities. 
</p>
<p> At the start of the second volume are three summaries of all the numbers: the 10 
main classes, the 100 divisions, and the 1,000 sections. They are a good place to begin 
when trying to assign a Dewey number for an unfamiliar topic. After deciding about the 
topic to be represented, choose an appropriate main class, based on the emphasis of the 
material. For example, it would be easy if there were only one place to put a book on 
computers, but if the book emphasizes the machinery, it is classified with other books 
on machinery in the 600s, applied science and technology. If it emphasizes computer 
programs and applications, it is classed nearer to research in the 000s. A video about 
trucks might emphasize the truck as a type of vehicle (600s), or it might emphasize 
transportation via truck (300s). 
</p>
<p> In some cases, a classification number is chosen to reflect the interests of library 
users. For example, Figure 18.1 shows a book about the free-trade agreement between 
Canada and the United States. Depending on the library, either 382.971073, stressing 
Canada&Ecirc;s agreements with the United States, or 382.973071, stressing U.S. agreements 
with Canada, is equally correct. In both cases, assigning the full nine-digit number 
enables the classification to reflect an item involving both countries, no matter which 
comes first.    
</p>
<p> DDC allows options in classification for some topics. Biography is one of these. 
The preferred method is to place a biography with the topic for which the person is 
known. The biography of Lincoln Hall (see Figure 18.2), for example, is classified in 
mountaineering.  
</p>
<p> However, DDC provides an alternate series of numbers in the 920s for libraries 
that wish to shelve all biographies together. The following options are suggested: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Use the 920&ndash;928 schedule, for example, 923.871 (biography of Canadian 
persons in commerce, communication, transportation) 
</p>
<p> &bull; Use 92 for individual biographies 
 &bull; Use B (indicating Biography) for individual biographies 
 &bull; Use 920.71 for biographies of men, 920.72 for biographies of women </p>

</p>
<p> In addition, some libraries use 920 for collected biographies and 921 for individual 
biographies. 
</p>
<p> A good rule of thumb to remember about classification is that it aims to bring re-
lated works together. To do this, a cataloger can look in the shelflist or on the shelves 
to see what kinds of materials were assigned the number being considered. If the 
materials do not appear to be related to the work in hand, the cataloger should look 
elsewhere for an appropriate classification number. 
</p>
<p> Throughout the schedules, selected numbers are left blank (or &bdquo;unoccupied&permil;) to 
allow for future expansion without disturbing the existing numbers. In the 000s, for 
example, 007&ndash;009, 013, 024, and 040&ndash;049 are unoccupied. Although many areas of 
the 500s and 600s are very crowded, and there are categories bearing numbers of seven 
or more digits, some sections in these classes remain unoccupied. 
</p>
<p> A Closer Look at the Schedules 
</p>
<p> DDC&Ecirc;s main classes are explored here in greater detail, noting the subjects each 
typically includes; however, no attempt is made to list all subjects in any of the main 
classes. Familiarity with the schedules is best acquired by using them, together with a 
library&Ecirc;s shelflist and common sense. 
</p>
<p>  000s: Generalities  includes works about knowledge in general; research; com-
munication in general; computer science, updated to accommodate recent topics such 
as the World Wide Web, virtual reality, and markup languages; controversial knowl-
edge, such as UFOs, the Loch Ness monster, and the Bermuda Triangle; reference 
materials, such as bibliographies and catalogs; library and information science, includ-
ing reading in general; encyclopedias; organizations; publishing; and collections that 
cover many topics. 
</p>
<p>  100s: Philosophy, Paranormal Phenomena, and Psychology  includes concepts 
and schools of thought in detail, as well as the occult, the entire field of psychology, 
logic, and ethics. 
</p>
<p>  200s: Religion  deals solely with this one subject area. Changes begun in the 21st 
edition to address a long-standing criticism of Christian bias were completed in the 
current edition. That bias&middot;traceable to literary warrant in 19th-century U.S. college 
libraries, where collecting was largely confined to books about the Christian religion&middot;
persisted into the 21st century. Although non-Christian religions still tend to have long 
numbers, many new developments have increased the level of detail available for ma-
terials about these religions, including Judaism, Islam, Bahaism, Black African reli-
gions, and American native religions. 
</p>
<p>  300s: Social Sciences,  in keeping with its label, covers sociology, political sci-
ence, economics, law, public administration, and social problems. It also includes sta-
tistics (demographic statistics, not probabilities, which is located in mathematics); 
military science; education; commerce; and an odd group of topics headed &bdquo;Customs, 
Etiquette, and Folklore,&permil; under which subtopics such as marriage, death, war, holi-
days, chivalry, suicide, and cannibalism are subsumed. The 22nd edition includes revi-
sions in the numbers for social groups (305&ndash;306) and law (340s). 
</p>
<p>  400s: Language  is a straightforward class. It begins with language in general (i.e., 
linguistics) and follows with numbers for individual languages beginning with English 
and other Western European languages. Preferential positioning of English and European </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Dewey Decimal Classification 387
</p>
<p>languages probably is due to literary warrant and the fact that this is an American 
scheme, but the schedules include an instruction explaining how classifiers can give 
local emphasis to any other language of their choice. 
</p>
<p>  500s: Natural Sciences and Mathematics  includes mathematics, which was revised 
substantially in the 22nd edition; astronomy; chemistry, also revised in the 22nd edition; 
physics; geology; the sciences of the ancient world, paleontology and paleozoology; and 
the life sciences, first in general and, then, the separate subjects of plants and animals. 
</p>
<p>  600s: Technology (Applied Sciences)  includes medicine and health, revised in the 
22nd edition; engineering; agriculture (raising plant crops and animal husbandry); man-
agement; manufacturing; and buildings (but not architecture, which is found in the next 
main class, fine arts); and home economics and family living. Popular topics found here 
include parenting, pets, cookbooks, gardening, electronics, and automobiles. Many fine 
distinctions must be made between pure and applied sciences, necessitating careful ex-
amination of other works in the collection to bring together related items, for example, 
distinguishing between botany (580) and horticulture (630), or between immunity in 
animals (591.29) and immunity in human beings (616.079). 
</p>
<p>  700s: The Arts, Fine and Decorative Arts,  as previously mentioned, combines the 
familiar topics of art in general; architecture; painting; sculpture; crafts; and music; 
with performing and recreational arts. One finds circuses, movies, and television at 
791, titled generically &bdquo;Public performances&permil;; theater, vaudeville, and ballet, called 
&bdquo;Stage presentations,&permil; at 792; while other kinds of dancing are grouped at 793 as &bdquo;In-
door games and amusements,&permil; along with puzzles, riddles, magic, and so on. The char-
acterization of television as a &bdquo;public performance&permil; and folk dancing as an &bdquo;indoor 
amusement&permil; reflect the perceptions of earlier times. Today, people tend to think of 
television as an indoor amusement, while in some small towns folk dances are held 
outdoors as public events even if they are not paid public performances. Games of skill, 
including computer games and chess, are classed in 794, but games of chance (where 
some might prefer putting computer games) are in 795. Bowling is classed as an &bdquo;in-
door game of skill,&permil; in 794, while baseball and football are at 796 with other &bdquo;Athletic 
and outdoor sports and games.&permil; The distinctions are, perhaps, transparent to those who 
watch all three sports and more on their television sets. &bdquo;Aquatic and air sports&permil; are 
at 797; outdoor sports that bring people close to nature&middot;horseback riding, animal 
racing, hunting, and fishing&middot;are found at 798 and 799. An interesting placement in 
the 700s is photography. One might expect photographic art and techniques would be 
found under different main classes in the same way computer software and hardware 
are separated, but an entire division, 770&ndash;779, is devoted to the art of photography, its 
techniques, and its processes. Specialists who see film and television art as a subset of 
photographic arts in general might be critical of these placements. The music schedule 
(780&ndash;789), although it resembles other schedules in outward appearance, was revised 
completely in the 20th edition, and is actually a faceted scheme based on the British 
Classification for Music. 
</p>
<p>  800s: Literature (Belles-Lettres) and Rhetoric  in general is followed in this class 
by the individual literatures of different countries, beginning, as one might expect, with 
American literature in English. An instruction here similar to the one for languages en-
ables the literature of a different nation or language to be assigned the preferential posi-
tion, if desired. English literature in English and Anglo-Saxon literature is followed by 
European literatures, including Latin and Greek, both ancient and modern, consuming </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>388 18&mdash;Classification Systems
</p>
<p>all but the final ten sections, 890&ndash;899. These last few numbers cover all of Asian, 
Middle Eastern, and African literature as well as Russian, Polish, and other languages 
less familiar to North Americans. Shakespeare is the only author with his own number, 
822.33. A citation order is strictly observed in the 800s: country/language first, followed 
by genre and time period. All individual literatures do not have defined time periods&middot;
only popularly collected literatures have them. Three tables for literature (see the &bdquo;A 
closer look at the tables&permil; section in this chapter) augment these topics. 
</p>
<p>  900s: Geography, History, and Auxiliary Disciplines,  the final class, begins with 
three divisions for general works on both geography and history (900&ndash;909); general 
works on geography alone, including travel books (910&ndash;919); and biography (920&ndash;929). 
Regarding biography, application policies given in the manual and used at the Library 
of Congress&Ecirc;s (LC) Decimal Classification Office recommend using the 920s solely for 
collective biographies and classing the life stories of individuals in the subjects with 
which each is associated. Thus, biographies of mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and 
Nikolai Lobachevski who pioneered non-Euclidean geometry, would be in 516.9 with 
that subject, and a biography of Sigmund Freud would be in 150, with other works on 
psychology. The other seven divisions (930&ndash;999) are devoted to history alone, begin-
ning with a division for the ancient world and followed by one each for the continents 
of Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, and South America. All other countries and 
regions are grouped into the final division, including the final section, 999, for extrater-
restrial worlds. The 22nd edition includes an expansion of numbers for the Holocaust 
at 940.5318. 
</p>
<p> A Closer Look at the Tables 
</p>
<p> Because creating coextensive class numbers requires use of the tables, a closer look 
at them is warranted. Each number in the tables is preceded by a dash to show that it may 
not be used alone, but must be attached to a number from the schedules. The tables are 
preceded by a table of precedence directing classifiers how to assign multiple subdivi-
sions when more than one subdivision is applicable. 
</p>
<p>  Table 1, Standard Subdivisions:  Table 1 is used most frequently, because applying 
it does not require an explicit instruction in the schedules. If the base number in the 
schedules to which the subdivision is being applied has instructions to apply standard 
subdivisions in special ways, they must be heeded. These explicit instructions super-
sede unlimited application of numbers from Table 1. The DDC&Ecirc;s mnemonics are rec-
ognizable to a great degree in the standard subdivisions. The philosophy of a subject 
is designated -01, just as the 100s represent that field; -06 is the standard subdivision 
for organizations and management, just as the 650s stand for management; -09 stands 
for historical and geographic treatment, just as the 900s stand for those fields. The 
analogies are not complete, however: -05 stands for serial publications, not scientific 
aspects; -08 stands for history and description of a subject among groups of persons, 
not literary treatments; and so forth. A new number for racism was established in -08 
in the 22nd edition. 
</p>
<p>  Table 2, Geographic Areas, Historical Periods, Persons:  Table 2 can be applied 
only when an explicit instruction directs classifiers to do so. Table 2 gives numbers 
for geographic areas, beginning with general areas such as frigid zones at -11 (-113 if 
they are north of the equator and -116 if they are south of it), or land and landforms </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Dewey Decimal Classification 389
</p>
<p>at &ndash;14. Locations in the ancient world are identified by -3 in this table; those in the mod-
ern world are assigned numbers between -4 and -9. Some locales, particularly in the 
United States, have their own numbers; for example, the number for New York City&Ecirc;s 
borough of Manhattan is -7471. Size is not the issue that decides whether a special 
number is established, however. All of Antarctica is classified at -989, and all extrater-
restrial worlds are classified at -99. The issue is how much material is published about 
the place. Table 2 has another major application: Standard subdivision -09 instructs 
classifiers to go to Table 2 for a number for a specific geographical area to which a 
topic is limited, and to add it to -09. For example, an item about forest lands in France 
is classified 333.75'09'44. (The meaning of the prime marks that appear after the 5 
and 9 in this number is explained later.) The first five digits (333.75) represents for-
est lands in general, the addition of -09 from Table 1 represents limited geographical 
treatment, and, following the instruction there, the addition of -44 from Table 2 repre-
sents France. Major changes to this table in the 22nd edition and subsequent updates 
address political changes affecting jurisdictions and boundaries. 
</p>
<p>  Table 3, Subdivisions for the Arts, for Individual Literatures, for Specific Literary 
Forms:  Numbers from Table 3 are applied only when explicit instructions direct classi-
fiers to do so. Table 3 is made up of three subordinate tables: Table 3-A, &bdquo;Subdivisions 
for Works by or about Individual Authors&permil;; Table 3-B, &bdquo;Subdivisions for Works by 
or about More than One Author&permil;; and Table 3-C, &bdquo;Notation to Be Added Where In-
structed in Table 3-B, 700.4, 791.4, and 808&ndash;809.&permil; In Tables 3-A and 3-B, the general 
categories of genre and criticism are subdivided finely for arranging very large collec-
tions of literary materials about authors. In Table 3-C, different categories with their 
subdivisions are found, such as literary qualities or themes, to be used for arranging 
very large collections of general literary criticism. 
</p>
<p>  Table 4, Subdivisions of Individual Languages and Language Families:  Table 4 
contains subdivision numbers to be added to base numbers for individual languages 
(420&ndash;490) from the main schedules. Frequently used numbers from this table include -3, 
which represents dictionaries, and -86, which stands for readers in a language. The 
numbers in this table include other characteristics of language materials and publication 
form; for example, -5 is &bdquo;Grammar of the standard form of the language.&permil; 
</p>
<p>  Table 5, Ethnic and National Groups:  Table 5 contains numbers for racial, ethnic, 
and national groups, organized more or less by geographic origin; for example, -1 stands 
for North Americans, -2 for people of the British Isles, -3 for Nordics, and so on. Some 
interesting divisions occur in this table; for example, Modern Latins (-4) includes French, 
Walloons, and Catalans. It does not include Italians, Romanians, and related groups, who 
have their own numbers beginning -5, or Spanish and Portuguese peoples, whose num-
bers begin with -6. The -6s include all Spanish-Americans at (-68) as well as Brazilians, 
subsumed under Portuguese-speaking peoples at -69. The number for groups not previ-
ously given their own numbers, -9, includes Semites, North Africans, Asians, Africans, 
and indigenous peoples of America and Australia. Individual peoples within this large 
group also have their own numbers; for example, Sri Lankans are at -91413. An option in 
Table 5 allows classifiers to put a group other than North Americans at -1 if local empha-
sis is desired for that group. 
</p>
<p>  Table 6, Languages:  Table 6 contains numbers for subdividing languages of the 
world, but they are not intended to be added to base numbers from the 400s. The table 
provides for the language characteristics of materials classed in the other schedules. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>390 18&mdash;Classification Systems
</p>
<p>If, for example, a translation of the Bible into Dutch is being classified, the notation 
for Dutch language from Table 6 (-3931) is added to the base number for the Bible 
(220.5) to form a coextensive number for Dutch-language Bibles, 220.53931. Here, 
as in the 400s, 800s, and elsewhere, an option allows users to put a language other 
than English first. DDC gives preference to English (-2) and European languages (-3 
to -8). The languages of the rest of the world follow in -9. Table 6 is a tiny encyclope-
dia of the world&Ecirc;s languages, enumerated in a few pages. 
</p>
<p> New classifiers are reminded to go to Tables 2 through 6 only when explicitly in-
structed to do so. Table 1&Ecirc;s numbers (standard subdivisions) are the only ones that may 
be applied without specific instructions. At the same time, classifiers must be alert to 
instructions limiting or changing the normal pattern for standard subdivisions. They 
may be directed to use -001 to -009 in place of the usual -01 to -09; or they may be in-
structed to use -03 to -09, which means the first two standard subdivisions (-01 and -02) 
cannot be used for the particular number or number span to which the instruction ap-
plies. Situations sometimes arise for which there are no instructions in either the 
schedule or the manual, but, more often, the editors give needed guidance about the 
way subdivisions should be assigned. 
</p>
<p> LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CLASSIFICATION 
</p>
<p> LCC is the result of applying practical solutions to practical problems. When LC&Ecirc;s 
collections were destroyed by fire during the War of 1812, Thomas Jefferson sold Con-
gress his personal library, then numbering about 7,000 volumes, as the basis for build-
ing a new collection. Along with the materials came Jefferson&Ecirc;s own classification 
system, which remained in place until the turn of the 20th century. Herbert Putnam, 
then the new Librarian of Congress, implemented many changes at LC, including the 
launching of a new classification. The choice was not an easy one. The DDC was in 
its fifth edition at the time, and Cutter&Ecirc;s Expansive Classification, a popular rival, was 
in its sixth. However, after consideration of these and other alternatives, Putnam and 
Charles Martel, LC&Ecirc;s chief cataloger, decided to devise a new and different scheme 
having as its primary objective solely the orderly arrangement of LC&Ecirc;s current and 
future holdings. They wanted to avoid adopting an existing scheme into which LC&Ecirc;s 
holdings would have to be fitted. 
</p>
<p> One result of the main objective&middot;organizing LC&Ecirc;s holdings for effective retrieval&middot;
was to release LC from any obligation to a higher authority, such as the DDC&Ecirc;s edi-
tors. LC has total control over the classification. Another was to permit literary war-
rant to govern the scheme, which evolved into a loose federation of schedules, each 
fitting a particular subject area according to what LC owned and expected to collect 
in the years to come. Although several overarching principles are found throughout 
LCC, each schedule is an individual entity in which the breakdown and organization 
of the subjects need not relate to any other schedule. Thus, some schedules are in their 
fourth, fifth, or later editions, and the most recently developed law schedules are still 
in their first editions. (At the end of the 20th century, LC abandoned numbered edi-
tions in favor of dated editions.) 
</p>
<p> LCC is updated continuously. Decisions on new or revised classification num-
bers are disseminated online via LC&Ecirc;s Web site and in its  Classification Plus  product. </p>

<p> Other aids to using LCC for original classifying include LCSH (for general guid-
ance only; numbers listed there should never be used without consulting the schedules 
themselves), the  Classification and Shelflisting Manual; LC Classification Outline; 
LC Pocket Guide;  and  JZ and KZ: Historical Notes &amp; Introduction to Application.  
The most complete guide to LCC is  A Guide to the Library of Congress Classification 
 by Lois Mai Chan.3 
</p>
<p> Principles Underlying LCC 
</p>
<p> Nine principles underlie the organization and structure of LCC: 
</p>
<p>  1.  Classification by discipline.  Like DDC, LCC divides knowledge first 
into disciplines, but there are 21 rather than 10, and the concept of what 
constitutes a discipline differs considerably from Dewey. For example, 
DDC&Ecirc;s interpretation of the discipline of social sciences (300s) includes 
political science, law, and education, whereas LCC&Ecirc;s interpretation does 
not, making each of those subject areas a separate discipline (J, K, and 
L, respectively). 
</p>
<p>  2.  Literary warrant.  This principle, which dictates that classes be created 
only when materials exist that require them, operates much more promi-
nently in LCC than it does in DDC. In DDC, literary warrant acts more 
as a priority check, because DDC attempts to classify all knowledge, not 
just the knowledge covered by existing documents. (Even DDC does not 
include all potential subjects, because to do so would require an infinite 
number of classes.) LCC aims only to classify all of LC&Ecirc;s holdings, not 
all knowledge. As a result, the classification does not need to anticipate 
and accommodate topics outside LC&Ecirc;s collecting interests. The experts 
who devised the original schedule created numbers for existing holdings 
and for those topical areas in which they believed publication would 
flourish  and  that LC would continue collecting. 
</p>
<p>  3.  Geographical arrangement.  In the course of legislative research, inquiries 
often involve particular places; therefore, subdivision by geographical lo-
cation is often preferred over subdivision by other characteristics geared 
to a subject&Ecirc;s natural hierarchy. 
</p>
<p>  4.  Alphabetical arrangement.  A second subdivision technique used by LCC 
is cutter numbers, which alphabetize when they are applied. LCC uses 
cutter numbers for many elements throughout the schedules, including 
geographic names, topical terms, and personal names. Although cutter 
numbers are thought of as mnemonic devices, they do not assist memory 
very much in LCC, because they are applied differently in different parts 
of the schedules. There is no guarantee that the same term, if it appears 
in different parts of the schedules, will be cuttered the same way; or, con-
versely, that the same cutter number will represent the same word or name 
in different parts of the classification. At times the cutter number does not 
represent a name or word, but stands for a topical subdivision. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>392 18&mdash;Classification Systems
</p>
<p>  5.  Economy of notation.  The LCC uses mixed notation, employing both al-
phabetic and numeric characters. It can represent extremely narrow top-
ics with fewer characters than DDC uses for topics at the same level of 
specificity. 
</p>
<p>  6.  Close classification.  The LCC originated at a time when LC&Ecirc;s collection 
contained more than one million books. It was devised to handle not only 
this many items but also an ever-growing total. Thus, it reflects a deep 
specificity that DDC does not, even though DDC can be extended to ac-
commodate equally narrow topics. In LCC, classifiers are more likely to 
find an established number that matches the topic of an item being classi-
fied than they are if they use DDC&middot;provided, of course, that LC collects 
in the subject area. 
</p>
<p>  7.  Enumeration.  Similar to DDC, LCC enumerates a very large proportion 
of the categories it provides and minimizes the use of number-building 
devices that allow classifiers to synthesize their own classes. The enor-
mous size of LCC (40-plus volumes) is evidence of its heavy reliance on 
enumeration. 
</p>
<p>  8.  Relative location.  Like DDC, LCC uses the principle of relative location, 
although its use of geographic and alphabetic subdivisions tends to frag-
ment materials related to one another in a topical hierarchy. 
</p>
<p>  9.  Stability of numbers.  Although not explicitly stated, LC numbers, once 
established, rarely change. Very few schedules have changed radically, al-
though it has happened. For example, the JX schedule (International law) 
was eliminated in 1997 and its topics relocated in other schedules; and, 
much earlier, numbers originally established within various schedules for 
legal aspects of subjects were eliminated and different numbers for these 
topics were developed as part of new law (K) schedules. 
</p>
<p> Like DDC, none of LCC&Ecirc;s principles operate perfectly throughout the entire clas-
sification, but they are observed as long as they do not conflict, create unwanted juxta-
positions of subjects, or interfere with practical considerations. For example, enumera-
tion is sometimes abandoned to save space; choices between geographic, alphabetic, 
and topical subarrangements may be forced; and other principles may be modified as 
LC&Ecirc;s management desires. Nevertheless, the operation of the principles can be observed 
throughout the schedules. 
</p>
<p> In addition to the nine principles, the following seven-point intellectual structure 
devised by Charles Martel is seen in the arrangement of materials within classes and 
subclasses. Current policies have abandoned it, so it is not found in newer numbers. 
</p>
<p>  1.  Form.  The first few numbers of classes and subclasses are allocated to 
general form subdivisions, including periodicals, often linked with society 
publications, yearbooks, congresses, documents, exhibitions and muse-
ums, and directories. 
</p>
<p>  2.  Theory and philosophy . 
  3.  History and biography.  
  4.  Treatises and general works.  </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Library of Congress Classification 393
</p>
<p>  5.  Law.  Until the K classes were completed, legal materials for a subject 
were classed with the subject; for example, building codes were classed 
in TH219 with building construction, TH9500 with fire prevention, and 
so on. Since the publication of separate law classes, these numbers have 
been deleted and relocated within the law schedules (K). 
</p>
<p>  6.  Education.  Materials dealing with study, teaching, and research on a sub-
ject, as well as textbooks on that subject, are included in this section. 
</p>
<p>  7.  Specific subjects and subdivisions.  These numbers are the bulk of each 
schedule. 
</p>
<p> Martel&Ecirc;s seven-point structure applied to topics at each level of hierarchy. For ex-
ample, TH1 is &bdquo;Periodicals and societies&permil; for building construction as a whole; TH1061 
is &bdquo;Periodicals, societies, etc.&permil; for systems of building construction; and TH2430 is 
&bdquo;Periodicals, societies, congresses, etc.&permil; for roofing. Every topic does not have a num-
ber for periodicals; for example, floors and flooring, the topic following roofing, does 
not. Development of special numbers for periodicals depends on the likelihood that 
periodicals covering a subject are published and that LC collects and classifies them. 
Note that the phrase used differs in each of the three instances in the example, combin-
ing different types of publications. 
</p>
<p> Format of LCC 
</p>
<p> Forty-three separate volumes of enumerated numbers make up LCC at the time of 
this writing, and it is also available as an online product,  Classification Web,  which 
is available by subscription from LC&Ecirc;s Cataloging Distribution Service. In the print 
edition, some disciplines occupy a whole volume (e.g., A, C, J, L, M, N); two share a 
volume (E-F); others are divided among several volumes (B, K, P). Class P, languages 
and literatures, is contained in 11 volumes plus a separate volume of tables. Each 
volume contains some or all of the following parts: 
</p>
<p>  1.  Preface.  Gives a brief history of the schedule and its editions. 
  2.  Synopsis.  Lists the primary divisions of the class (or subclass) of the 
</p>
<p>volume. 
  3.  Outline.  Summarizes the main subdivisions of the class. A combination 
</p>
<p>of all of these outlines, which used to be published from time to time as 
a paper pamphlet, is available now online at LC&Ecirc;s Web site. 
</p>
<p>  4.  Schedule.  This is the body of the volume. It enumerates all the numbers 
in the subclasses. 
</p>
<p>  5.  Tables.  Includes tables intended for use throughout the schedule. LCC 
has three interschedule or auxiliary tables: cutter numbers for countries 
of the world, U.S. states and Canadian provinces, and cities. The auxil-
iary tables are not printed in all volumes but appear in H, T, and Z. Other 
tables, such as those used with the P schedules, are published separately 
from the schedules. 
</p>
<p>  6.  Index.  Provides access to terms used in the volume. 
</p>
<p> The lack of a combined index to LCC is a serious drawback. Also troublesome 
for classifiers is the lack of coordination between LCSH and LCC. Terminology for </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>394 18&mdash;Classification Systems
</p>
<p>a topic differs between the two tools, and the LCC numbers provided in LCSH are 
not prescribed, merely suggested. Scope notes and helpful instructions are sporadic 
in LCC schedules, although some appear. For example, at VM20, Shipbuilding in the 
20th century, it says, &bdquo;For individual companies, shipyards, etc., see VM301.A-Z.&permil; 
</p>
<p> Printed volumes of LCC have neat, attractive pages bound in paper covers. Li-
braries often rebind them to ensure that they remain in good condition despite heavy 
use. The online version is more convenient to store, search, and use. It is updated daily, 
offers numerous ways to search for class numbers, can be browsed, displays subject 
headings and DDC numbers that correspond to particular LCC numbers, automati-
cally calculates table numbers, and can be linked to local online cataloging systems. 
The product includes LCSH and LCC. The Cataloging Distribution Service offers free 
trials and tutorials for new users, making it attractive for libraries that do a great deal 
of original classifying to switch from buying the printed volumes to the online version. 
The cost of a subscription depends on the number of users within an institution, but it 
seems reasonable. 
</p>
<p> Main Classes of LCC 
</p>
<p> Main classes in LCC are designated by letters of the alphabet. Depending on how 
one counts, one or two letters may define a main class. For example, if a cataloger 
takes the broad view, P stands for languages and literatures, PR is English literature, 
and PS is American and Canadian literature. The same idea is applicable to B (Phi-
losophy and Religion), H (Social Science), and K (Law), which may be seen broadly 
as three individual classes or narrowly as several classes each. The other classes are 
all given one letter, with the exception of history, which encompasses four single let-
ters (C, D, E, and F). An outline of LCC appears in Figure 18.3.   
</p>
<p>Figure 18.3. LCC Outline.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Library of Congress Classification 395
</p>
<p> The outline reveals several differences between the overall structures of LCC and 
DDC. First, several subjects grouped together in DDC are given their own schedules 
in LCC: Agriculture and Medicine are not part of Technology, and each has its own 
schedule; Education, Political Science, Law, and Military and Naval Sciences are not 
part of Social Sciences, and each has its own schedule; Generalities and Bibliography/
Library Science are distinguished into two separate classes, A and Z, respectively, that 
are as far apart in the alphabet as possible. Second, DDC&Ecirc;s wide divergence between 
Language and Literature (400s and 800s) is absent from LCC. Both subject areas are 
combined in P. Third, in LCC, Music (M) and Fine Arts (N) each has its own schedule, 
separate from Recreation. Recreation is found in the Arts class in DDC but is located 
at the end of the Geography (G) schedule in LCC. Finally, History and Geography, 
separated into several different schedules, are located toward the beginning of the 
scheme, immediately after Religion, instead of at the end of the classification as they 
are in DDC. History and Law are among LC&Ecirc;s largest groups of holdings, so it is un-
derstandable that between them these two subject areas cover 15 printed volumes, or 
nearly one-third of the scheme. 
</p>
<p> LC does not use the two schedules developed by LAC for materials relating to Ca-
nadian history and literature: FC (Canadian history) and PS8000 (Canadian literature). 
Canadian libraries aiming to assign more specific classification numbers to Canadian 
topics may prefer to use derived records from LAC rather than LC for those subject areas. 
Figure 18.4 illustrates the difference in classification schedules for Canadian history.

</p>
<p> Subdivision in LCC 
</p>
<p> The use of geographical location to subdivide a topic is frequently encountered 
in LCC. Geographic subdivisions may be arranged alphabetically or by area, and the 
latter arrangements often give preference to the United States and/or the countries of 
Europe and the Western Hemisphere. An example of this arrangement can be found at 
&bdquo;Exploitation of timber trees&permil; (S434&ndash;534). After a number for general works, the topic 
is further subdivided by country, beginning with the United States and followed by the 
rest of the Americas, Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the Atlantic Islands, and, 
finally, the Pacific Islands. Elsewhere, the countries are listed in alphabetical order, as 
can be seen in the next part of the schedule at &bdquo;Plant culture: study and teaching&permil; 
(SB51&ndash;52). In this case, SB51 is used for general works and SB52 is used to further 
subdivide the topic geographically with the instruction to add a cutter number &bdquo;by re-
gion or country, A-Z.&permil; This means that every country is assigned a cutter number using </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Library of Congress Classification 397
</p>
<p>the initial letter of its name and one or more digits to represent a subsequent letter or 
letters, thus producing an alphabetical arrangement. 
</p>
<p> Topical subdivisions under each geographic locality are sometimes represented by 
designated number spans for different countries and sometimes by a different letter-
and-number device resembling a cutter number. To subdivide the topic &bdquo;Regulation, 
inspection, etc. of seeds&permil; (SB114), a cataloger uses .A1 for the publications of societies, 
.A3 for general works, and .A4-Z for specific regions or countries. Although the first 
two subdivisions resemble cutter numbers, they do not represent words or names as 
ordinary cutters do. The United States has a special cutter number under the .A4-Z por-
tion: .U6&ndash;7, where .U6 represents general works and .U7 is further subdivided by state, 
A&ndash;W. According to this instruction, a work about the inspection of seeds in the state of 
Georgia would be SB114.U7G+. (An additional level of subdivision allows the classi-
fier to add a third cutter number to represent a specific locality within each state.) 
</p>
<p> Topical subdivisions of a subject unrelated to geographic locations can also be ar-
ranged alphabetically by means of cuttering. The S schedule is particularly rich in lists 
of cuttered subtopics, such as different types of crops, ornamental plants, plant diseases, 
and trees. In the list of trees, some of the cuttering goes to five digits beyond the initial 
letter. Topical subdivisions can also be represented by a sequence of whole numbers. 
For example, in the HV schedule (Social Pathology): 
</p>
<p> HV6085 = general works on the language of criminals; 
 HV6089 = prison psychology; 
 HV6093 = general works on intellectual and aesthetic characteristics of criminals; 
 HV6097 = prison literature, wall inscriptions; 
 HV6098 = tattooing; and 
 HV6099 = other forms of intellectual and aesthetic expression among criminals. 
</p>
<p> Differing treatments for similar topical arrangements makes for an extremely com-
plicated scheme. In addition, the lack of effective aids to its application makes LCC dif-
ficult to implement for original classification outside of LC. Libraries that adopt LCC 
expect to do little, if any, original classification. They are under the impression they can 
find all or nearly all of the materials they buy already classified. If this is true, they are 
well satisfied. 
</p>
<p> Use of cutter numbers as part of the classification is one of the disadvantages of 
LCC for libraries other than LC; no one but LC can assign an official cutter number for 
anything&middot;a location, a topic, or a shelf mark. Other libraries must wait until LC clas-
sifies an item requiring the appropriate cutter number before it is officially established. 
A cataloger might encounter a book on a particular type of tree that is not in the list 
given under SD397. To classify it, the cataloger must guess at which numbers LC will 
use in the numeric portion of the cutter, and if there is any doubt about the proper name 
of the tree, the initial letter as well. (Imagine the following hypothetical example: A 
cataloger is assigning cutters for different types of people who receive discount fares 
on public transit. Would that cataloger call student recipients &bdquo;students&permil; or &bdquo;educational 
recipients&permil;? Would older people be identified as &bdquo;seniors,&permil; &bdquo;aged,&permil; or &bdquo;elderly&permil;? Would 
civil servants be lumped into one group, or divided into &bdquo;police,&permil; &bdquo;transit workers,&permil; &bdquo;fire-
fighters,&permil; and so on?) </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>398 18&mdash;Classification Systems
</p>
<p> LC establishes new cutter numbers after consulting its shelflist to see what al-
ready has been assigned. In doing so, its classifiers sometimes decide to depart from 
their usual pattern, a simple formula with just a few rules (see Figure 18.5), because of 
a unique problem, or because of their expectation about future assignments likely to 
affect few libraries outside of LC. The first element in an LC cutter number consists of 
the initial letter of the word to be represented, combined with one or more Arabic nu-
merals chosen according to the rules shown in Figure 18.5. A publication titled  Clas-
sification and Shelflisting Manual,  which combines two earlier manuals titled  Subject 
Cataloging Manual: Classification  and  Subject Cataloging Manual: Shelflisting,  of-
fers guidance on how to assign LCC numbers and create call numbers for materials.4   
</p>
<p> Note the different cutter numbers in the two Cataloging-in-Publication (CIP) items 
on the verso of Figure 15.9 on page 318:   A5155 from LC and A5158 from LAC (then 
National Library of Canada). LC and LAC have assigned slightly different cutters 
because of the items they already have in their collections. 
</p>
<p> Comparison of DDC and LCC 
</p>
<p> LCC has many more numbers and many more specific classes than DDC in which 
to place very narrowly defined topics. For instance, LCC has individual numbers for 
most 19th-century English and American authors, and some individual numbers for 
each of their works. Contemporary U.S. authors are assigned classification numbers 
according to the first letter of their surname and cutter numbers according to the sec-
ond letter of their surname. The difference is made clear by an example: In DDC, Kurt 
Vonnegut would join most of his contemporaries at 813.54 (U.S. writers of fiction 
working after 1945); in LCC, he would join only those U.S. writers working after 1961 
whose surnames begin with &bdquo;V&permil; at PS3572. That is a large difference in specificity. The 
</p>
<p>Figure 18.5. LC rules for creating cutter numbers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Library of Congress Classification 399
</p>
<p>desire for specificity is one reason large libraries such as the Boston Public Library 
and many university libraries turned to LCC. LCC&Ecirc;s stability of numbers is another. 
</p>
<p> Small libraries that made the change to LCC did not always do so to achieve greater 
specificity but to take advantage of the larger proportion of titles classified accord-
ing to LCC by LC and other major originators of cataloging copy, freeing them from 
having to do as much original classification. Small or medium-sized college libraries 
using OCLC thought they would save a great deal of time (and, therefore, money) by 
copying the LCC numbers found online instead of doing original classification. 
</p>
<p> Another contrast is the nature of the classification number produced by each 
scheme. LCC numbers usually are shorter for topics of the same specificity, but their 
combination of alphabetic characters and numbers is not necessarily easier to remember 
or use. Some people may find the alphanumerics more understandable and logical, 
but others prefer the purely numerical system of DDC, particularly when libraries add 
cutter numbers as shelf marks and other marks in various alphanumerical sequences 
to the classification number to give each item a unique shelf location. This can result 
in very complicated combinations of all sorts of characters, including upper- and low-
ercase letters, whole and decimal numbers, and punctuation. To accommodate all of 
this information on books with narrow spines, libraries often break up the arrange-
ment of the classification number into several lines. It is sometimes hard to tell where 
the classification number ends and shelf marks begin, or what follows what; for ex-
ample, should JX1977.8.C53q1984 come before or after JX1977.D5b1987? (In the 
Simmons College library, it came after, although the JX numbers are now obsolete; 
thus, these books were either reclassified or discarded.) 
</p>
<p> The general use of cutter numbers in all libraries as shelf marks becomes con-
fusing when they are also part of the classification numbers. It is especially confus-
ing when an item has several cutter numbers, perhaps with one denoting geographic 
location, another denoting a topic subdivision, and a third for the shelf mark. The 
LCC&Ecirc;s methods of subdividing are quite different from DDC&Ecirc;s. One of LCC&Ecirc;s favor-
ites, shown in the previous examples, is to add cutter numbers for subtopics or geo-
graphical subdivisions (or, sometimes, for both). LCC also uses numerical expansions 
to subdivide topics, but they are added differently. When DDC instructs classifiers to 
add to a number, it means that some other number from a table or another section of 
the schedule will be tacked on to a base number from the schedules, which is known 
as concatenating the numbers. For example, to expand the number for cooking, 641.5, 
to French cooking, one adds 9, representing geographic focus, and 44, for France, to ob-
tain 641.5944. In LCC, the instruction to add a number from a table to a base number in 
the schedules may mean to add the two numbers arithmetically. For example, to expand 
the number for classical art in countries other than Greece and Italy (N5801&ndash;5896), 
one adds a number from a designated table to the base number N5800. Using the num-
ber 13 for Canada, one adds it to 5800 to get N5813, representing classical art in 
Canada. Sometimes, when whole numbers are lacking to subdivide a topic as desired, 
LCC uses decimal numbers. In the previous example, to subdivide classical art in the 
United States for the colonial period, one adds 03.5 to 5800, to arrive at N5803.5. 
LCC occasionally contains instructions to subdivide (or, as they deem it, subarrange) 
a topic like another class number in the schedule, but this is done far less frequently 
than in DDC. Rather, LCC simply lists various subarrangements in the schedules, and 
most differ from one another. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>400 18&mdash;Classification Systems
</p>
<p> The degree of browsability that results from using LCC or DDC is an important 
consideration. Because of its principle of hierarchy, DDC produces arrangements that 
tend to be more satisfying to browse from a subject searcher&Ecirc;s point of view. Use of al-
phabetical instead of hierarchical subarrangements, which LCC does by means of cut-
tering, tends to scatter materials on related topics and bring together topics at different 
levels of hierarchy. Even geographical subarrangement may be less browsable, despite 
its logic, for subject searchers who are more interested in topics than locations. 
</p>
<p> Finally, the difference in cost of the two tools is a practical matter that bears men-
tion, although in the long run it may be the least important matter. DDC&Ecirc;s four printed 
volumes (or the subscription to WebDewey) are a great deal less expensive than LCC&Ecirc;s 
40-plus volumes (or the subscription to Classification Plus), even though individual 
LC schedules are good value for the price. 
</p>
<p> NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE CLASSIFICATION 
</p>
<p> LCC includes class R for Medicine. It is considered adequate for general libraries 
that collect small numbers of materials in that field. However, the U.S. National Li-
brary of Medicine (NLM), which collects far larger numbers of health-related materi-
als on more specific topics than do most general libraries, did not find class R suitable 
for arranging its materials. Instead, NLM developed its own highly specialized clas-
sification system. The NLM classification, abbreviated here NLMC, was designed to 
coordinate with LCC for two reasons: (1) so that LCC could be used successfully in 
conjunction with it to classify materials held in its collection falling outside of the field 
of medicine (e.g., materials on malpractice law); and (2) so that LCC numbers could be 
used for health-related fields of study deemed preclinical. Such fields of study, while 
related to medicine, actually fall outside the realm of medical practice (e.g., anatomy 
and biochemistry). 
</p>
<p> Background and Development 
</p>
<p> The NLM began before the U.S. Civil War as the library of the Surgeon General of 
the U.S. Army and was known then as the Army Medical Library.5 It remained under 
the authority of the Army until 1956, when control was demilitarized and transferred 
to the Public Health Service unit of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. 
At that time, the library&Ecirc;s name was changed to NLM. It moved to its current home in 
Bethesda, Maryland, on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in 1962. 
</p>
<p> As early as 1944, an Army survey recommended that the collection should be 
classified by a system like that of LC. In response to the recommendation, a classifi-
cation committee, chaired by Keyes Metcalf, was formed to design the system. The 
classification committee, working with medical consultants, produced a preliminary 
edition of the new medical classification in 1948. This edition was revised over the 
next several years and published in 1951 under the title  U.S. Army Medical Library 
Classification.  The designers adopted the alphanumeric notation of LCC, using the let-
ter W, which was not defined in LCC. A second letter defined the principal schedules 
within W, including the physiological system, various specialties connected with them, 
regions of the body involved, and subordinate related fields (see Figure 18.6). They </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>National Library of Medicine Classification 401
</p>
<p>also adopted Charles Martel&Ecirc;s system of starting each schedule within W with form 
numbers for specific publication types.   
</p>
<p> NLMC has two important features that differ from LCC. First, it uses the same 
controlled vocabulary&middot;MeSH&middot;that is used by NLM to index the medical literature. 
As a result, MeSH is an effective index to NLMC. Second, it maintains the MeSH hier-
archy of subjects, called &bdquo;tree structures,&permil; that leads searchers from the broadest subject 
areas to the most specific topics falling under them. Thus, there is a synergy between 
the two tools that makes it much easier for librarians and researchers to navigate be-
tween MeSH and NLMC. 
</p>
<p> Format of NLMC 
</p>
<p> NLMC is available solely in electronic form, although, since 2006, it can be down-
loaded as a pdf file and printed should a library wish to do so. The NLM was an early 
pioneer in bibliographic data processing, establishing the Medline database of medical 
literature in the 1960s and 1970s. NLMC was issued in sequentially numbered editions 
until 1999, when the fifth revised edition was the last one to be issued in print. 
</p>
<p> NLM states: &bdquo;The online environment offers many advantages to users including 
hyperlinks between class numbers in the index and the schedules, and between terms 
within the index and direct links from these to the MeSH record itself under the MeSH 
Browser.&permil;6 NLMC is updated annually in conjunction with MeSH. The close relation 
between the two subject analysis tools is a great help to searchers.

<p>402 18&mdash;Classification Systems
</p>
<p> Main Classes and Subdivisions 
</p>
<p> NLMC is divided into 33 basic subclasses (see Figure 18.6) in contrast to LCC&Ecirc;s 
17 basic subclasses of medicine (see Figure 18.7). The preclinical subclasses that 
precede them include six schedules from LCC&Ecirc;s class Q:   
</p>
<p>  1. QS Human anatomy 
  2. QU Biochemistry 
  3. QV Pharmacology 
  4. QW Microbiology/immunology 
  5. QY Clinical pathology 
  6. QZ Pathology 
</p>
<p> Most of the numbers in NLMC are intended to be assigned to monographs. Serially 
issued publications are mainly classified by form in W1, with some exceptions. The 
exceptions are government and hospital reports and statistics, classified at W2; direc-
tories, handbooks, and similar publications, classified in other form numbers (W3&ndash;39), 
used also for monographs; and bibliographies and indexes, which are classed in ZW, Z 
plus the NLMC number for specific topics, or other Z numbers from LCC.7

<p>National Library of Medicine Classification 403
</p>
<p> The level of specificity in NLMC&Ecirc;s class W is much greater than that found in 
LCC&Ecirc;s class R. This is to be expected, since the principle of literary warrant dictates 
that numbers are not created unless LC has literature that requires them. The NLM col-
lects more medical literature than LC and a considerable amount of it is on narrower 
topics aimed at the specialists who conduct medical research. 
</p>
<p> Note in Figure 18.6 that classes WL, Nervous system, and WM, Psychiatry, cover 
aspects of neurological and mental illnesses likely to overlap with psychology. NLMC 
concerns itself with the medical issues, which is entirely appropriate given that psy-
chiatry is a subdivision of medicine and psychiatrists are medical doctors. Generally, 
psychologists are PhDs, not MDs. Materials intended for psychologists are classified in 
LCC class BF, although some materials classed in BF as well as pharmacology infor-
mation in LCC QV is likely to be of interest to both psychologists and psychiatrists. 
</p>
<p> NLMC also has tables. One covers geographic subdivisions and is called Table G. 
It consists of nine capital letters signifying nine countries or regions, beginning with A 
for the United States. Few countries are subdivided further, with the exception of the 
United States, Great Britain, and Australia. When a country or region is subdivided, a 
second letter is added, to which whole numbers may also be added to obtain smaller 
locations. Table G has numbers for the U.S. military services and other federal depart-
ments related to medicine. 
</p>
<p> NLMC in Libraries 
</p>
<p> The NLM catalogs more than 20,000 items annually, assigning MeSH subject head-
ings and NLMC numbers to them. If a book is a CIP publication, the record is available 
in the NLM&Ecirc;s Locator Plus database (http://locatorplus.gov/). Machine-readable cata-
loging (MARC) records for NLM&Ecirc;s preliminary records are identified by an NLMC 
call number in the 060 field and/or data coded in the local 999 field. If the 999 field 
says &bdquo;CIP,&permil; it means the NLM intends to acquire the book. If NLM does not intend to 
acquire the book, the 999 field says NOC. When a preliminary record is completed, 
the 999 field says AUTH. 
</p>
<p> It is safe to assume that medical libraries prefer accepting and using NLMC call 
numbers for their materials. General university research libraries, however, acquire 
medical materials for their collections, the rest of which are arranged by LCC call num-
bers. Those libraries must decide how to arrange their medical materials. The materials 
may bear both LCC and NLMC call numbers, one or the other, or neither. In all events, 
some acquired materials are bound to lack the desired call number type and require 
original classifying, which is costly and time consuming. 
</p>
<p> General libraries can opt to keep all medical materials in one place&middot;R or W&middot;or 
they can use both types of call numbers, preferring one type when both are present. If 
medical materials are shelved together, users benefit by having only one place to look 
for medical materials. However, this is the more costly option. Materials that contain 
only the wrong type of call number and those with no call number at all have to be 
classified originally. 
</p>
<p> To minimize the amount of original classifying that must be done, libraries can opt 
to shelve medical materials in two places&middot;at R and at W. Doing this, however, causes 
materials on like topics to be fragmented, makes browsing difficult, and requires users 
and librarians to look up every item they seek in the catalog to determine where it is </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>404 18&mdash;Classification Systems
</p>
<p>located. The advantage to using both types of call numbers is that it is faster and less 
costly, because it requires less work. If either type of call number appears in a CIP or 
online catalog record for newly acquired materials, it can be accepted. Only materials 
having no CIP and no source records from which to copy call numbers, discussed more 
fully in the next section, have to be classified from scratch. 
</p>
<p> &ldquo;COPY&rdquo; CLASSIFICATION 
</p>
<p> Catalogers often use the DDC and LCC numbers provided by LC in the CIP in-
formation located on the verso of the title pages of books, or they find classification 
numbers in computer network records, such as OCLC. If so, conventions followed by 
larger institutions should be understood. For DDC numbers, the most important of 
these is the method used to show where numbers have been expanded. An apostrophe 
(also called a  prime  or  hash  mark) is placed at the end of the basic number and again 
after each complete expansion of a number (see Figure 18.2 for an example of a prime 
mark.)   
</p>
<p> Some agencies using DDC prefer that numbers not become too long and institute 
policies to limit them. Such policies should involve the addition or omission of expan-
sions, for example, to limit a classification number to the basic number, or to one or 
more expansions beyond the basic number. They should not dictate a maximum num-
ber of digits, because for some numbers, the meaning would be lost. For example, 
the correct DDC number for slavery in ancient Athens is 306.3620385. This is a very 
long number that would only be necessary if a library has (or expects to have) many 
items about slavery in the ancient world in its collection. But the basic number for 
slavery has six digits, so, if library policy dictated stopping after a maximum of five, 
that basic meaning would be lost. The meaning of the entire number is as follows: 
</p>
<p> 306 culture and institutions 
 306.3 economic institutions 
 306.36 systems of labor 
 306.362    slavery 
 306.36203   slavery in the ancient world 
 306.362038   slavery in ancient Greece 
 306.3620385  slavery in ancient Athens 
</p>
<p> Some libraries, including LC, furnish more than the class number, adding shelf 
marks to it. When using another library&Ecirc;s catalog records, shelf marks should be ignored 
unless it is a local policy to follow these practices. If so, the cataloger must be careful 
about  whose  practices are followed. In some places, the initial letter of the main entry is 
used in place of a cutter number. In others, two-, three-, or four-digit cutters are used. It 
might be confusing to adopt all of these practices simultaneously. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> DDC is widely used all over the world. It is the basis for the Universal Deci-
mal Classification and some national classifications as well (for example, in Korea 
and Japan). Its popularity in the United Kingdom is ensured by its use in the  British </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Summary 405
</p>
<p>National Bibliography  and all the British Library&Ecirc;s authoritative online cataloging. 
Its flexibility is sufficient to serve many purposes, and its ease of use is enhanced by 
the mnemonics, the Relative Index, and its easily grasped overall logic. 
</p>
<p> LCC is widely used among academic libraries in the United States and, because 
of the likelihood that LC numbers are used in bibliographic network records, by some li-
braries outside of the United States as well. LCC is much larger and more complex than 
DDC. Its overall arrangement of subjects is, perhaps, more logical and better organized for 
contemporary use than DDC is, particularly in the fields of science and history. Using it to 
classify materials from scratch, however, is difficult for librarians outside of LC, because it 
is controlled entirely by LC and devoted to the arrangement of LC&Ecirc;s own collections. 
</p>
<p> LCC requires less number building than DDC does and provides shorter classifi-
cation numbers than does DDC (although they are made up of letters and numbers) for 
subjects of the same specificity. LCC seems more hospitable to new topics and allows 
for far greater subdivision of topics. In addition, it avoids trying to force differing dis-
ciplines into a single mold and allows every subject area to have the arrangement most 
natural to its literature. 
</p>
<p> The bias of LCC toward the United States, its neighbors, and traditional allies is, per-
haps, even more pervasive than DDC&Ecirc;s, but more understandable. LCC does not try to be 
a universal classification of knowledge, but only an orderly arrangement of LC&Ecirc;s books. 
The difficulty of applying LCC to nonbook materials is probably no greater than ap-
plying DDC. Both schemes were developed to arrange books. In LCC&Ecirc;s favor is the 
fact that there are more opportunities for close classification, a useful attribute because 
nonbook items may have very narrowly defined topics. 
</p>
<p> The specialized NLMC is patterned after LCC and is used in conjunction with 
LCC by medical libraries. In addition to numbers starting with the letter W, NLMC 
uses six schedules in LCC class Q for preclinical fields such as anatomy and pharma-
cology. NLMC uses mixed notation and has several tables for further specifying topics, 
including Table G for geographic locations. 
</p>
<p> LC and other libraries using LCC are unlikely to change to DDC. LCC is equally 
unlikely to become ubiquitous in North America or anywhere else. Rather, the dichot-
omy in the classification of library materials between DDC and LCC is likely to con-
tinue, with the choice depending on an agency&Ecirc;s traditions, size, and orientation toward 
a particular source of cataloging and classification data. Heightened awareness of the 
workings of each system and an understanding of their differences and implications for 
use are valuable both for librarians and patrons. 
</p>
<p> Before going on, readers may want to try assigning DDC and/or LCC numbers to 
the following examples. The answers are on page 409   at the end of this chapter.

</p>
<p> MARC Format 
and Metadata 
</p>
<p> Online cataloging has greatly enhanced the usability of catalogs, thanks to 
the rise of MAchine Readable Cataloging (MARC standards). 
</p>
<p> &middot;New World Encyclopedia 
</p>
<p> Metadata is a generic term applied to the information created to identify, describe, 
and manage digital documents. However, definitions for metadata (and there are many, 
explored later in this chapter), can also be used to define library cataloging, which is 
the process of creating the information used to identify, describe, and manage library 
materials&middot;both digital and analog documents. This chapter explains how cataloging 
data are prepared or marked up for entry into computerized databases. It also cov-
ers machine-readable cataloging (MARC), the library standard for digitizing biblio-
graphic data, as well as other systems for accomplishing the same purposes used by 
librarians and members of communities beyond the library world. 
</p>
<p> MACHINE-READABLE CATALOGING 
</p>
<p> The MARC formats are a set of markup protocols for five kinds of information: 
bibliographic; authority; classification; holdings; and community entities, activities, 
and events. Adding MARC protocols to the information puts it into a form that can 
be understood and used by properly programmed computers. MARC is similar in 
principle to SGML, HTML, and other markup languages used for transmitting textual 
electronic resources. 
</p>
<p> The MARC formats are  communications  formats. Once data are marked up as a 
MARC-formatted record, a computer can transmit the data to another computer. The 
term  bibliographic data  applies to all of the elements of a bibliographic record that 
have been described in this book so far: descriptions, access points, subject headings, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>412 19&mdash;MARC Format and Metadata 
</p>
<p>and call numbers.  Authority data  cover all of the elements of an authority record for 
names, titles, or subject descriptors, including the authorized form of the name or 
topic, cross-references to other name forms or topical terms, and references to the 
source material used in creating the authority record.  Holdings data  are the specific 
data relating to any item in a library&Ecirc;s collection, including its copy number, cost, 
acquisition source, holding unit (such as a main library or branch library), or collec-
tion within a library or information center, and so forth. A fourth MARC format was 
developed for  classification data  and used to automate the Library of Congress (LC) 
classification. The fifth format is for  community information,  such as local officials, 
agencies, and lists of activities and events. 
</p>
<p> LC worked with automation pioneers&middot;including such peers as the Library and 
Archives Canada (LAC) and the British Library; large research libraries, such as the 
University of Toronto, Stanford University, and New York Public Library, and other 
interested parties&middot;in the development of the MARC formats. The ongoing evolution 
of MARC continues to be a cooperative endeavor, now of global proportions, shared 
by national libraries and major cataloging institutions, professional associations, and 
bibliographic networks. This chapter concentrates on the format for bibliographic data. 
</p>
<p> HISTORY AND BACKGROUND 
</p>
<p> The first MARC format was devised for the bibliographic data of books (printed 
monographs) in the 1960s. It went through several revisions before being published 
as a national standard in the 1970s by the National Information Standards Organiza-
tion. Before long, a MARC format for serials was devised, followed by MARC for-
mats for other types of materials for which LC produced bibliographies. After many 
years during which the number of separate MARC formats continued to grow, an 
integrated MARC format was implemented during the 1990s in which all fields were 
made uniform across all the physical forms of materials collected by libraries. All 
fields and codes are still not applicable to every type of material, but if they do apply, 
their meanings are the same, thereby simplifying the processes of learning and using 
the system of MARC protocols. 
</p>
<p> Individual bibliographic networks have issued manuals containing versions of 
MARC intended for use by their participants. Selected fields have been defined in 
unique ways by an individual network; for example, the coded version of the basic 
features of a document are known in the OCLC as  fixed fields  and in MARC 21 as 
field 008, shown in Figure 19.1.    
</p>
<p> Between 1994 and 1997, LC and LAC worked with their user communities 
through national MARC committees to reconcile the differences between the official 
Canadian and U.S. formats, known as CAN/MARC and USMARC, respectively. The 
result is MARC 21. MARC 21 is not a new format; it is a new name for the merged 
formats. MARC 21 consists of the five communications formats described previ-
ously: bibliographic data, authority data, holdings data, classification data, and com-
munity information. There also are concise formats for each of these. 
</p>
<p> Individual countries using the MARC formats had their own official versions, 
including the United Kingdom&Ecirc;s UKMARC (MARC 21 superseded UKMARC in 
2004); a generalized or universal version was also developed, called UNIMARC. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>History and Background 413
</p>
<p>Minor differences appeared among the versions of MARC formats, but their funda-
mental structure is identical and the same principles apply to them all.   It is important 
to know what the MARC formats are  not.  They are not a set of cataloging rules or a 
cataloging code. Instead, they are designed for use with data created by applying the 
standard cataloging rules, subject headings, and classifications discussed in previous 
chapters. Some accommodations are made for local data, but there are limits to how 
far the formats can be stretched. For example, the bibliographic format is geared to 
the  Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules,  second edition (AACR2), so a library that 
does not follow it will find itself having to create AACR-compatible records anyway 
in order to code descriptive data successfully. 
</p>
<p> The MARC formats are not catalogs either. They are intended to be used  in  com-
puterized catalogs as templates for record structures, but MARC, by itself, is not an 
information storage and retrieval system. Additional programming is required to use 
the MARC protocols for information storage and retrieval systems. 
</p>
<p> Ultimate authority over the MARC 21 formats rests with LC and LAC, though 
other groups in the two countries play consultative roles. In the United States, a major

<p>library associations, the Canadian Library Association and l&Ecirc;Association pour 
l&Ecirc;avancement des sciences et des techniques de la documentation, respectively. Bib-
liographic networks, such as OCLC in the United States and A-G Canada (described 
later in this chapter), also contribute important advice. The MARC Editorial Office at 
LC and MARC Office at LAC make and publish the final decisions. 
</p>
<p> The MARC formats look very complicated because they must include everything 
needed to identify every detail of a record to a computer that cannot understand any 
part of it by itself. However, they are really mechanical in nature&middot;a template for 
information produced by the application of content standards. 
</p>
<p> ELEMENTS OF A MARC RECORD 
</p>
<p> MARC records consist of a set of elements that include variable fields, fixed 
fields, and other control fields as well as protocols marking record beginnings and 
endings, and so on. The fields consist of tags, indicators, and subfields, each given 
numeric values, symbols, and alphanumeric codes, known generically as content des-
ignators. Adding the marks that identify record parts is called content designation. 
All of this is discussed in greater detail in this section. 
</p>
<p> Fields 
</p>
<p> Computer data generally are divided into parts called  fields,  and each field is fur-
ther subdivided into  subfields.  Bibliographic (catalog) records are made up of fields 
that correspond to each area of the catalog record (e.g., call numbers, primary head-
ings, titles, editions, publication information, subject headings, secondary headings). 
The subfields in each field, in turn, correspond to particular elements of the area; 
for example, subfields in the physical description field include one each for the ex-
tent, other physical details, dimensions, and accompanying materials; subfields in the 
Dewey Decimal call-number field correspond to the classification number, the shelf 
marks, and the edition of Dewey used. 
</p>
<p> Every MARC record has two kinds of information in it, contained in two kinds 
of fields: fixed and variable. The kind of information discussed in the previous para-
graph is variable in nature. The names of personal authors are an example. A person&Ecirc;s 
name may consist of a forename alone (Homer), a forename and a surname (William 
Shakespeare), a forename and a compound surname (Walter de la Mare or Sir Alec 
Frederick Douglas-Home), or a family name (Adams family). It may be another vari-
ant, such as initials or descriptive phrases. The name may have 7, 17, or 27 letters. It 
could require the inclusion of numbers, frequently encountered for royalty ( Elizabeth II 
or Louis XVI). Titles, too, may be short or long; may contain letters, numbers, and/or 
symbols; and may have one word or many. Such data must be contained in fields that 
are flexible enough to admit all these possibilities. These fields have variable lengths 
and are called, appropriately,  variable fields.  Variable fields contain almost all of the 
data covered in this book thus far. 
</p>
<p> Some information in entries does not vary but is always entered the same way, ei-
ther because the information is naturally invariant or because it is intentionally coded 
to eliminate variation. An example of naturally occurring invariable bibliographic </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Elements of a MARC Record 415
</p>
<p>data is the International Standard Book Number (ISBN). It always appears in the same 
form and sequence (10 characters for materials published before 2007 and 13 charac-
ters for those published later, all digits or with a final &bdquo;X,&permil; representing the number 10). 
An example of information deliberately coded in an invariant form is the geographic 
focus of a title. Geographic locations are reduced to seven characters representing the 
applicable continent, country, and locale. These kinds of information are contained in 
invariable or  fixed fields.  
</p>
<p> Information from the variable fields is sometimes duplicated in fixed fields in 
coded form so a programmer or a computer system can use it more efficiently. One 
such type of information relates to the physical description of materials. The physi-
cal description for nonbook materials is a good example. Different types of nonbook 
media have their own physical details. Films, videos, photographs, and electronic 
resources may have color or be in black and white. Sound recordings may be mono-
phonic, stereophonic, or quadrophonic. Microforms may be reduced to several reduc-
tion ratios. In each instance, the number of possibilities is limited, making it easy to 
use a few letters or numbers to reduce them to short, invariable codes and then add 
these codes to the computerized record. Thus, it is useful to code elements such as the 
language of the item, its country of origin, the presence or absence of illustrations, 
and a host of other important aspects of an item, some of which may not appear in 
the eye-readable portions of catalog records. They are given, in fixed and unchanging 
form, in the fixed fields. 
</p>
<p> The order of elements in the MARC format (see Figure 19.2) is very similar to 
the order of elements in a catalog record. The main exception is that call numbers, 
standard numbers, and other coded elements, called  control fields,  appear first. Some 
of these elements would not display to the public in library online public access cat-
alogs (OPACs). They are put first in computerized records because they generally 
identify the record and/or the item and, as such, are more efficiently utilized if they 
are read first. Generally, they are in coded form, such as a single character or a short 
string of characters in fixed order, and are not understandable until they are translated. 
Therefore, it is better to have them at the start of the record and not in the middle, 
where the coding would interrupt the bibliographic fields, or at the end, where a com-
puter processor would have to scan through the first part of the record to reach them.    
</p>
<p> Subfields 
</p>
<p> Subfields are parts of fields. Each field is divided into parts corresponding to the 
parts within an element of a whole area of description, an entire subject heading, or 
a complete call number. For example, the title area in a bibliographic description is 
usually made up of four subelements: title proper, general material designation, other 
title information, and statement of responsibility. The title field corresponds to the 
title area as a whole, and each of the four subelements corresponds to a specific sub-
field within the title field. The title proper subfield, subfield a, is the first subfield in 
the title field; the general material designation is the second subfield, subfield h; other 
title information is the third subelement, subfield b; and the statement of responsibil-
ity is the fourth subelement, subfield c. Similarly, the date is usually the third subele-
ment in the publication/distribution field, subfield c, following two subfields for the 
place (subfield a) and name (subfield b) of the publisher and/or distributor. These are </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>416 19&mdash;MARC Format and Metadata 
</p>
<p>examples of descriptive field subelements. Following are examples of subject and 
call number field subelements. 
</p>
<p>  1. If a subject heading for the novel  Gone With the Wind  is UNITED 
STATES&middot;HISTORY&middot;CIVIL WAR, 1860-1865&middot;FICTION, it consists 
of a main heading and three subdivisions, one topical, one chronological, 
and one a literary genre. In the MARC format, the heading is coded as 
follows: 
</p>
<p>  651 0 $a United States $x History $y Civil War, 1860&ndash;1865 $v 
Fiction. 
</p>
<p>  2. If the LC call number for a cookbook featuring French cuisine titled 
 Everyday Cooking with Jacques P&eacute;pin  is TX719.P458 and the Dewey 
Decimal call number for this book is 641.5944.P458, they would be 
coded in the MARC format as follows, respectively: 
</p>
<p>  050             4 $a TX719 $b .P458 
  082 04 $a 641.5944 $b P458 $2 22 
</p>
<p> In both of the previous call-number examples, the classification number appears in 
subfield $a; the shelf marks appear in $b. The Dewey call number has an additional

<p>Content Designation 417
</p>
<p>subelement coded $2, representing the edition number of the classification, which, in 
this example is the 22nd edition. 
</p>
<p> Indicators 
</p>
<p> Between the field names (that is, the tags) and the start of data in the field are 
places for two numerical characters known as  indicators.  One or both of the indica-
tors may be defined for a field, or neither may be defined. When only one indicator is 
defined it may be in either the first or the second position. For the most part, indica-
tors are values that instruct computer systems how to treat the data within the field to 
which they are assigned. For example, indicators in selected fields dictate how to index 
character strings, whether or not to display the data in the field, and whether or not 
to create an access point for the data in the field. For example, in fields in which per-
sonal names are entered, the indicator conveys information about whether the name 
is a surname followed by a forename (coded 1 = Einstein, Albert), a name with the 
forename first (coded 0 = Leonardo, da Vinci), or the name of a family (coded 3 = 
Kennedy family).1 The computer system needs this information to index the names 
properly. 
</p>
<p> The most important thing to remember about indicators is that their meaning 
differs for each field in which they are used. Originally, they were a vital element in 
printing catalog cards from computerized data, and they are equally useful to com-
puter programmers working with online systems, who use them to specify screen 
displays. 
</p>
<p> CONTENT DESIGNATION 
</p>
<p> Each field and subfield in a MARC record must be identified by a name, known 
as a  content designator.  In the MARC format, fields are identified by three-digit codes 
called  tags,  and subfields are identified by a symbol, called a delimiter, that identifies 
what follows as a subfield and a single letter, number, or, occasionally, a symbol, all 
called  subfield codes.  In the OCLC network, the delimiter appears as a double dag-
ger, in the A-G Canada system it appears as a dollar sign, and in the LC system it ap-
pears as a vertical bar. In this book, the dollar sign is preferred, although any of these 
symbols could be reproduced. However it appears, the function of the delimiter is the 
same&middot;to identify subfields&middot;even when various keyboards and printers interpret it 
in different ways. 
</p>
<p>  Content designation  is defined as the application of appropriate tags and subfield 
codes to cataloging data. Content designation is frequently called  tagging and coding 
 a record, or sometimes just  tagging  or just  coding  it. All these terms, as well as the 
term  encoding a record,  mean the same thing: that the protocols of the MARC format 
are being applied to cataloging data for entry into a computer system programmed 
to use it. 
</p>
<p> Fixed fields are usually among the first fields in a record. In OCLC, they are identi-
fied by mnemonic prefixes, beginning with &bdquo;Type,&permil; meaning &bdquo;type of material,&permil; and 
ending with &bdquo;Dates.&permil; In the LC, they are tagged field 008. Fixed fields are followed by 
other control fields, which include but are not limited to inventory control numbers, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>418 19&mdash;MARC Format and Metadata 
</p>
<p>product numbers, call numbers, holding library designations, and so on. Control fields 
bear tags beginning with 0 (zero). Primary access points, which follow the control 
fields, usually have tags beginning with 1. Title-proper primary access points are the 
exception. They are identified in the 245 field by means of an indicator. 
</p>
<p> Following the primary access point, fields relating to the descriptive elements 
have tags beginning with 2, 3, 4, and 5, in a numeric sequence that follows the order 
of the areas of description. One exception to this sequence is the tag for standard num-
bers, area 8, which, because it represents inventory control numbers, begins with 0. 
Subject headings bearing tags that begin with a 6 and secondary descriptive access 
points bearing tags that begin with 7 or 8 complete the record. A few MARC fields 
beginning with 9 are defined for use, representing local links of various kinds.

<p> Figures 19.3 and 19.4 show bibliographic records for the same book as they ap-
pear in two national bibliographic networks, with their tags, indicators, delimiters, 
and subfield codes. Both are MARC records, although there are recognizable differ-
ences in the way they look. Some of the differences occur because of the differing 
capabilities of various printers, and some occur because of the differing procedures 
followed by each network.

</p>
<p> BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS AND SHARED CATALOGING 
</p>
<p> An important feature common to library bibliographic networks such as OCLC 
is their use of the MARC format to enter and transmit their data. This acceptance of 
the MARC format by the networks helped make it an international standard. Never-
theless, each network adapts MARC in ways that aid its users. Some have altered the 
appearance and entry style of the 008 control field to make it easier to code; for ex-
ample, OCLC provides mnemonic prefixes in place of delimiters and subfield codes. 
Local fields unique to a network have been defined that are not part of the official for-
mat. Generally, however, MARC records are interchangeable and easily recognized.

<p>Metadata 421
</p>
<p> Networks incorporate national library cataloging. LC&Ecirc;s MARC records formed 
the nucleus and lion&Ecirc;s share of all network databases when they started and were a 
majority of records for a number of years. The balance between LC and member-
contributed original cataloging shifted during the 1980s and, since then, the proportion 
of LC and national library records has been shrinking. In the 1990s, LC began using 
the original cataloging of network member libraries as the basis for its own catalog-
ing. This change put real meaning into the phrase &bdquo;cooperative cataloging,&permil; which was 
formerly defined as everybody else copying LC&Ecirc;s original cataloging. 
</p>
<p> METADATA 
</p>
<p> Definitions of metadata range from the most basic&middot;data about data&middot;to one that 
is both more complex and more useful&middot;&bdquo;information used to find, access, use, and 
manage information resources primarily in a digital environment.&permil;2 Library catalog-
ing is information about all kinds of informational materials, analog and digital, mak-
ing it possible to include it in most definitions of metadata. 
</p>
<p> Experts recognize five types of metadata depending on the functions being 
supported: 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Administrative metadata , including acquisition information, rights and re-
production tracking, legal access requirements, location information, selec-
tion criteria for digitization, and version control 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Descriptive metadata , including cataloging records, finding aids, special-
ized indexes, hyperlinked relationships between resources, and annotations 
by users 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Preservation metadata , including physical condition data and documenta-
tion of actions taken, such as data refreshing and migration 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Technical metadata , including hardware and software documentation, digi-
tization, tracking response times, and authentication and security data (for 
example, passwords and encryption keys) 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Use metadata , such as exhibition records, use and user tracking, content 
reuse, and multiple versions. 
</p>
<p> The metadata itself can be made part of the resource itself, called  embedded  
metadata; or it can be carried by a separate electronic record, similar to a library cata-
log record, called  associated  metadata. Embedded metadata is advantageous because 
it is created by the same people who create the resource. Authors should know more 
about the resources they create than anyone else and, therefore, are uniquely qualified 
to create good metadata for them. In addition, if an electronic resource has embedded 
metadata, it is instantly available to searchers as soon as the resource is posted. There is 
no waiting period while someone else prepares and mounts the metadata, as is the 
case with associated metadata. Associated metadata, however, can be managed more 
efficiently within a system and is unlikely to be lost if the resource is moved from one 
system to another. Embedded metadata sometimes gets stripped away and lost during 
such transactions. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>422 19&mdash;MARC Format and Metadata 
</p>
<p> Metadata systems (or schema) may be general or subject specific. Members of 
some disciplines have developed their own metadata systems instead of using gen-
eralized systems, mainly because they wanted to include certain kinds of informa-
tion that were not in the generalized systems. One of the most popular generalized 
metadata systems among libraries is the Dublin Core, developed collaboratively by 
librarians and network experts from outside the library field. It is described in the 
next section. Two generalized metadata systems that provide greater specificity than 
Dublin Core (DC) are the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) 
and Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS). These are discussed in the sec-
tions that follow. 
</p>
<p> DUBLIN CORE 
</p>
<p> The aim of DC was to simplify metadata creation by requiring fewer elements 
than library cataloging, eliminating nearly all of the complicated rules about how to 
arrange the elements and what information is put into them, and using eye-readable 
tags in place of MARC-style content designators. DC&Ecirc;s simplicity is both an asset and 
a liability. On the positive side, it means that anyone can create metadata records with 
a minimum of training. At the same time, it allows for a great deal of ambiguity. Two 
DC records for the same resource could look very different; and two identical records 
might actually describe different resources. 
</p>
<p> DC takes two forms: simple and qualified. All DC elements are optional and repeat-
able, and they can be modified by adding qualifiers. Very few rules govern the data 
that go into an element. Simple DC has 15 elements relating to a document&Ecirc;s content, 
intellectual property, and instantiation, as follows: 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Content  (seven elements): Title, Subject, Description, Type, Source, Rela-
tion, and Coverage 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Intellectual property  (four elements): Creator, Publisher, Contributor, and 
Rights 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Instantiation  (four elements): Date, Format, Identifier, and Language 
</p>
<p> Users for whom these 15 elements are not sufficient can use qualified DC, which in-
cludes three more elements&middot;Audience, Provenance, and Rights holder&middot;as well as 
numerous element refinements that modify them all. 
</p>
<p> Details for the DC elements&middot;definitions, where the metadata creator should go 
to find the data, how elements should be input, guidelines on how to input them, and 
limits on their values&middot;can be viewed at the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Web 
site (http://dublincore.org/documents/dces). For example, the Contributor element is 
the entity responsible for making contributions to the content of the resource. The 
DC tagger is told to obtain the information from the item, the browser title, or other 
sources as appropriate and to enter the information as found on the item, including 
capitalization and punctuation. No controlled values are given. The Type element is 
defined as the nature or genre of the content of the item. The DC tagger is directed 
to determine type from the item itself. Type has controlled values: the definitions for 
10 types, such as collection, dataset, image, software, sound, text, and so on. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard 423
</p>
<p> Element refinements narrow the meaning of an element, making it more specific. 
For example, instead of just plain Date, DC taggers can give Date.issued, Date.cre-
ated, Date.available, and so on. Qualifiers allow the identification of specific schemes; 
for example, for the Subject element, these include Subject.class.DDC, Subject.topi-
cal.LCSH, Subject.class.LCC, Subject.class.SuDoc, and so on. 
</p>
<p> A debate continues between DC users who prize its simplicity and those who 
want it altered to support more elements of data and greater detail in the data. In ad-
dition to the advantage of its simplicity, which means taggers do not need extensive 
training, DC is flexible within its range of elements and can be mapped to MARC 
and other metadata schemas. Even with the added refinements and qualifiers, DC is 
far simpler than MARC. It is an economical alternative to full MARC cataloging for 
large numbers of electronic resources, especially if those resources are perceived as 
having short shelf lives. 
</p>
<p> METADATA ENCODING AND TRANSMISSION STANDARD 
</p>
<p> According to Cantara, &bdquo;The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard 
(METS) is a data communication standard for encoding descriptive, administrative, 
and structural metadata regarding objects within a digital library, expressed using the 
XML Schema Language of the World Wide Web Consortium.&permil;3 The first part of the 
definition sounds exactly like MARC, but the use of XML differentiates it from that 
library standard. METS was developed by a group of U.S. research libraries, includ-
ing Cornell University, the New York Public Library, and Penn State University on 
the East Coast, and Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley 
on the West Coast. METS features emphasize interoperability, scalability, and the 
preservation of the objects in the digital library. 
</p>
<p> METS documents can have seven parts&middot;a header and six sections&middot;as follows: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Descriptive metadata 
 &bull; Administrative metadata 
 &bull; File group (an inventory of files) 
 &bull; Structural map (outlines the object&Ecirc;s hierarchical structure and links ele-
</p>
<p>ments of that structure to its content) 
 &bull; Structural map linking (documents hyperlinks between any two links in the 
</p>
<p>previous section) 
 &bull; Behavior (associates executable behaviors with content in a METS object). 
</p>
<p> The only required section is the structural map section, which is known as the heart of 
a METS document. In addition, as a well-formed XML document, a METS document 
has one root element (&lt;mets&gt;) with five optional attributes of its own: XML identifier 
(ID), object identifier (OBJID), type (TYPE), label (LABEL&middot;the title of the object), 
and profile (PROFILE). 
</p>
<p> METS is governed by an international editorial board and is maintained at LC 
by its Network Development and MARC Standards Office. METS allows for greater 
detail than DC, making it possible for different institutions to share the contents of 
their digital repositories. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>424 19&mdash;MARC Format and Metadata 
</p>
<p> A brief outline of METS with excellent examples of METS sections and full 
documents is available at the MPDL Media Wiki Web site (http://colab.mpdl.mpg.de/
mediawiki/Metadata_Encoding_and_Transmission_Standard). 
</p>
<p> METADATA OBJECT DESCRIPTION SCHEMA 
</p>
<p> Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS), developed at LC, is a subset of 
19 MARC elements expressed in XML format. It was developed to expedite the tag-
ging of electronic resources. Instead of the numeric tags used in the MARC format, 
MODS elements are identified by language-based tags, as follows: 
</p>
<p> * titleInfo * name * typeOfResource 
 * genre * originInfo * language 
 * physicalDescription * abstract * tableofContents 
 * targetAudience * note * subject 
 * classification * relatedItem * identifier 
 * location * accessCondition * extension 
 * recordInfo 
</p>
<p> Most of the MODS elements have equivalents in MARC 21, although in some 
cases, multiple MARC elements were combined into a single element in the MODS 
schema. For example, the several linking entry elements identified by MARC tags 
76X&ndash;78X are covered by a single MODS element: relatedItem. However, type attri-
butes can be added to relatedItem to express relationships of different kinds. 
</p>
<p> All MARC values are not duplicated in MODS, but MODS has a richer descrip-
tive potential than DC. DC has 15 or 16 top-level elements, depending on whether 
it is simple or qualified DC. In contrast, MODS has 19 top-level elements. DC has 
28 additional subelements; MODS has 47. MARC records can be converted to MODS 
successfully, but once converted, the records are not reversible. Data are lost in the 
conversion from MARC to MODS; therefore, the MODS records cannot be returned 
to their original MARC forms. 
</p>
<p> MODS appears to be a compromise between very simple and very complex 
metadata tagging systems. As such, it is likely to be successful in meeting the needs 
of users trying to find speedily produced metadata with more detail than minimalist 
schemas such as DC are currently able to provide. 
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> At the time of this writing, the MARC format is the library-wide standard for 
digitizing bibliographic information. Developed at LC and adopted first by North 
American bibliographic networks and later by major cataloging institutions around 
the world, it is used as the basis for integrated library systems. MARC has been criti-
cized as being too complicated and difficult to learn, but it has exhibited a remarkable 
ability to change with the times and accommodate many kinds of data. 
</p>
<p> Newer markup systems, such as DC, METS, and MODS, were developed to 
provide simpler and speedier ways of digitizing bibliographic data for electronic </p>

</p>
<p>resources. Although MARC can be used for electronic resources, its complexity re-
quires a lengthy learning process and its application is time consuming. DC, the sim-
plest of the metadata schemas described in this chapter, has many fewer fields than 
MARC and uses words rather than numeric tags, so almost anyone can use it with 
very little training. METS and MODS both have more fields and can express added 
detail, making them more attractive to librarians who want more precision. 
</p>
<p> LC and OCLC have been at the forefront of metadata development, along with 
research libraries pioneering in building digital repositories. Libraries have a vested 
interest in the success of these endeavors as they take on important roles in burgeon-
ing global information systems.

<p>20  Copy Cataloging 
</p>
<p> You receive . . . into your library every year some twenty thousand volumes, 
or something like that. Why, if you had a printed catalogue dropped down 
from Heaven to you at this moment perfect, this day twelve-month[s hence,] 
twenty thousand interlineations would spoil the simplicity of that catalogue. 
</p>
<p> &middot;the Right Honourable J. W. Croker 
</p>
<p>  Copy cataloging  is the name given to operations that use existing catalog records 
as data sources for materials being cataloged, editing the records in accordance with 
local policies so they can be incorporated into local catalogs. It is an appropriate name 
because the local catalogers are, essentially,  copying  relevant information from the 
source records they use instead of building entirely new records from scratch by tran-
scribing information directly from the materials. Another name for copy cataloging is 
 derived cataloging,  because local library records are  derived  from preexisting source 
records. This chapter uses the term  copy cataloging . 
</p>
<p> Copy cataloging has two principal goals: saving time and saving money. A third 
goal can be ensuring the quality of the records entered into the local library catalog, but 
achieving this goal depends on the likelihood that the source records are of better qual-
ity than the agency would achieve if its staff prepared an entirely new record without re-
lying on existing records, generally called &bdquo;original&permil; cataloging. Copying poor-quality 
records cannot provide a good local catalog. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Saving time:  The idea behind copy cataloging is that, in order to produce a 
finished catalog record, local catalogers need not spend the time it takes to 
transcribe data carefully from materials to create bibliographic descriptions, 
determine descriptive access points, determine and assign subject headings, 
perform authority-control activities, classify the material, add shelf marks 
to create call numbers, and enter all the data into the catalog. Instead, the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>428 20&mdash;Copy Cataloging
</p>
<p>process is as fast as 1-2-3: (1) find a source record to copy; (2) make cer-
tain it matches the material being cataloged, and (3) change only those few 
elements that vary locally, such as call numbers. Voil&agrave;! The work is done. 
Instead of taking as much as 40 minutes to an hour for one book, copy cata-
loging might be done in 10 minutes or less. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Saving money:  Because the largest proportion of cataloging cost is paying 
for catalogers&Ecirc; time, speeding up the cataloging process enables local librar-
ies to save money in addition to time, even though they may have to pay to 
gain access to source records, for example, to join a bibliographic network. 
On balance, the cost of access to the source records is believed to be less 
than the cost of original cataloging for all materials a library acquires for its 
collections. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Ensuring quality:  As already mentioned, the quality of copy cataloging de-
pends on the quality of its sources. Records appearing in Cataloging In Publi-
cation (CIP) that originate at the Library of Congress and the national libraries 
of Canada and the United Kingdom provide the highest-quality data available 
and are only rarely incorrect. Catalogers should be particularly careful in 
checking unlabeled CIPs because some publishers provide their own CIPs, 
which may be done by untrained staff, thus reducing their publication costs. 
However, copying records that do not match the material being cataloged, 
copying records that match but lack needed data, or copying records that match 
but are created by people who do not conform to cataloging standards or are 
careless about transcription and data entry introduces errors or other prob-
lems into local catalogs, which cause retrieval problems for the patrons who 
search them. Source quality is discussed further in the next section. 
</p>
<p> POLICY ISSUES 
</p>
<p> To save the most time and money, library administrators may erroneously assume 
that source records can be accepted and used in local catalogs &bdquo;as is,&permil; without any fur-
ther work. Though ideal, this is rarely the case, because selected elements from outside 
local libraries do not apply to the local situations. In particular, call numbers are likely 
to be different from those of the source libraries, but call numbers are not the only 
problems. Five policy areas usually have to be considered: acceptability of sources, 
record fullness, errors in the source copy, call numbers, and tracings. 
</p>
<p> 1. Acceptability of Sources 
</p>
<p> Copy catalogers recognize that all source records are not equally good. Sometimes 
source records lack needed data and sometimes they contain errors. Using them without 
adding the missing data or correcting errors debases the local catalog and makes it a less 
effective search tool for local patrons. Doing the work to upgrade poor-quality source re-
cords takes time and costs the local library money. Thus, although network contracts usu-
ally require that existing records be used if they match the materials being cataloged, the 
provision is hard to enforce. Copy catalogers might not recognize matches due to errors 
or omissions. To ensure that they avoid wasting time and work only with quality records, 
copy cataloging supervisors develop lists of preferred, acceptable, and unacceptable 
sources. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Policy Issues 429
</p>
<p> Catalogers recognize a hierarchy of quality that rates national libraries at the top, 
providing the best-quality records; followed by records created by trained members 
of the Program for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC), which are known to meet current 
national standards; records created by large research libraries that maintain knowl-
edgeable cataloging staffs; and records created by catalogers working in a selection 
of other libraries known to do good cataloging. A great many contributors to shared 
cataloging databases recognize the importance of full and accurate data, and do their 
best to enter good-quality original cataloging into the database. 
</p>
<p> For many of the books a general library buys, preliminary catalog records appear 
on the verso of the title page as CIP. These data are authoritative and include access 
points that conform to name, title, and subject authorities as well as officially assigned 
Dewey Decimal Classification numbers and full Library of Congress call numbers. The 
principal disadvantage of using CIP records is their lack of full descriptive data, miss-
ing because the records are created before the books are published and, thus, cannot be 
determined. As a result, the data in the CIP record must be checked for accuracy and 
the missing data supplied, such as pagination and other physical descriptions. While 
CIP is generally accurate, sometimes the absence of the published book causes even 
the best cataloger to make mistakes that appear in the printed CIP. Figure 20.1 shows 
a CIP record containing erroneous data that is likely to have occurred because the cor-
rect information was not available at the time the preliminary record was created. A 
second disadvantage of relying solely on CIP for source data is that some books still do 
not provide it, and it is generally not available for materials other than books.    
</p>
<p>Figure 20.1 Incorect CIP.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>430 20&mdash;Copy Cataloging
</p>
<p> Equally authoritative and generally more complete than CIP is the cataloging in 
the machine-readable cataloging (MARC) database. These MARC records are prepared 
by catalogers at the Library of Congress and selected partners, including the Library 
and Archives Canada, the British Library, and members of the PCC trained to meet 
national library standards. Records entered initially as preliminary CIP records are later 
updated when the finished products are receiv ed. In addition, cataloging for materials 
other than books is included. MARC records are transferred electronically to the major 
bibliographic networks and become part of network databases, or the MARC database 
can be purchased from the Library of Congress or another national library to be added 
to local databases.  
</p>
<p> Bibliographic networks, such as OCLC, Inc. (the acronym stands for Online Com-
puter Library Center, founded in 1967&ndash;1968), provide their members and other subscrib-
ers with services for shared cataloging. Early in their history, the Library of Congress&Ecirc;s 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Policy Issues 431
</p>
<p>MARC database, still part of network databases, made up the largest share of catalog 
records, but members&Ecirc; original cataloging soon outstripped it and continues increasing 
in proportion to national library contributions. In addition to providing network mem-
bers with shared cataloging, many libraries are served by networks indirectly when they 
purchase their cataloging from cooperative or commercial suppliers that obtain the data 
they sell from the networks. The quality of cataloging obtained from networks varies 
depending on the quality of the original contributions and the level of quality control 
imposed by the network. Generally, efforts are made to ensure that standards are met, 
but in a great many instances compliance is voluntary and no real enforcement mecha-
nisms are in place. 
</p>
<p> Commercial companies may offer only catalog records for library customers or they 
may offer many products and services, such as supplying materials to libraries, process-
ing materials and/or selling the processing products, and designing and selling computer 
software for catalogs, circulation control, and so on. Companies may purchase catalog-
ing data from bibliographic networks and/or generate original cataloging themselves. 
Quality standards at levels designated by customers can usually be guaranteed. Com-
mercial companies offer customized catalog records for a price, adding value to the data 
they buy from outside sources and enabling customers to function as they wish without 
hiring specialized staff or reprocessing network records themselves. 
</p>
<p> 2. Record Fullness 
</p>
<p> Local policies concerning bibliographic levels govern the amount of information 
provided in original cataloging. The second edition of the  Anglo-American Catalogu-
ing Rules  and all its subsequent versions provided for three levels of fullness (see chap-
ter 13, pages 245&ndash;51  ). Bibliographic level 1 omits some data elements that are important 
for libraries with large collections, whose patrons depend on catalogs for research. Even 
when level 2 is the norm, optional elements can be omitted on a routine basis. Some 
libraries opt for minimal-level cataloging (such as OCLC K level or PCC core records) 
for some materials given original cataloging, especially if they face a combination of 
heavy workloads and shrinking resources. A long-time debate continues over the rela-
tive value of less-than-full cataloging versus no cataloging at all. The chart in Figure 20.2 
shows the difference between OCLC K and I level records.    
</p>
<p> Despite cataloging rules and network contract obligations, some libraries omit data 
they do not use, such as notes, standard numbers, added entries, and numerous subject 
headings. (One of the authors worked in a library that filed only title added entries, but 
no others. Among her tasks was crossing out the unwanted added entries from Library 
of Congress unit cards.) Some libraries assign no more than one or two subject head-
ings to nonfiction materials, do not check authority files, and establish new headings as 
they appear on materials without worrying about using only authorized name forms or 
potential conflicts. 
</p>
<p> 3. Errors 
</p>
<p> Catalog records prepared and processed by human beings are bound to contain 
some errors, despite quality control procedures and other efforts to keep network data-
bases clean. The policy issue is what to do about errors found in source copy. Should </p>

<p>Policy Issues 433
</p>
<p>they be allowed to remain, or should they be corrected? Three choices are possible: cor-
rect all errors, correct no errors, or correct selected errors. The first choice is the most 
costly, and policy makers should be certain that having an error-free catalog is worth the 
expense before taking that option. The second choice contributes most to loss of quality 
and presents the most problems for local patrons trying to search in the catalog. The 
third choice is a compromise solution that tries to balance cost and quality. 
</p>
<p> Catalogers generally divide errors into those that affect retrieval, such as misspelled 
titles, names, or subject headings, and those that do not, such as misspelled notes or 
incorrect punctuation. Knowing that it costs the library money to correct errors that do 
not affect retrieval and are unlikely to cause problems for searchers, local libraries may 
choose not to correct them. In that event, rules must be devised that clearly identify the 
&bdquo;must correct&permil; errors for data entry staff. Also, library staff must be prepared for patrons to 
see the uncorrected errors on their screens and, possibly, complain about them. 
</p>
<p> 4. Call Numbers 
</p>
<p> Of all the elements of a standard catalog entry, the call number is most likely to 
vary from one library to another. A call number is a shelf address in a local library 
collection. There is little to be gained from making it conform to the shelf address of 
any other library, including the Library of Congress. Local classification and shelf-
marking policies may mandate differences from recommendations of standard tools 
and the practices of leading libraries. Typical examples include the following: 
</p>
<p> &bull; Not classifying fiction; instead, arranging it alphabetically by authors&Ecirc; sur-
names in a separate Fiction section; or, classifying fiction by genre into a 
number of sections such as General Fiction, Short Stories, Westerns, Science 
Fiction, Romances, and Mysteries. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Not classifying periodicals; instead, arranging them alphabetically by title 
in a separate Periodicals section. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Not classifying individual biographies; instead, arranging them alphabeti-
cally by the subjects&Ecirc; surnames in a separate Biography section. 
</p>
<p> &bull; Using cutter letters instead of cutter numbers. 
 &bull; Obtaining cutter numbers from Cutter tables instead of synthesizing them 
</p>
<p>from the Library of Congress&Ecirc;s cuttering rules. 
</p>
<p> 5.  Tracings  (Subject Headings and Added 
Entries/Access Points) 
</p>
<p> General libraries with small collections catering mainly to students, novices, and 
casual readers may find that numerous tracings&middot;long lists of subject headings and 
added entries&middot;offer information that is unlikely to be of use to their patrons. Instead 
of making the local catalog a better and more informative research tool, the unwanted 
tracings clutter it up and make searches more confusing. Eliminating unwanted trac-
ings requires editing, but it slows down the growth of the catalog. Alternatively, a library 
could provide the ability to look up the MARC record where all tracings are included. 
</p>
<p> Decisions about these and other matters dictate what should and should not be 
included in local catalog records and how the information should appear. These deci-
sions are important to make before choosing a source database and starting to do copy </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>434 20&mdash;Copy Cataloging
</p>
<p>cataloging. Local variations that cannot be shown to have clear and tangible benefits 
for patrons should be avoided, because they take more editing time and, therefore, add 
to the cost a local library ends up paying for its cataloging. 
</p>
<p> OVERVIEW OF THE OPERATION 
</p>
<p> Copy cataloging begins with choosing the source or sources for cataloging copy. 
Once the source(s) are chosen, operations involve five steps: (1) searching and retriev-
ing records to copy from source databases, (2) confirming the record matches with the 
material to be cataloged, (3) editing data from the source records, (4) entering local data, 
and (5) producing the records. 
</p>
<p> Choosing the Source(s) 
</p>
<p> As discussed earlier, source data may originate as CIP information, records in na-
tional library databases, and/or records in bibliographic network databases. (Libraries 
that buy from commercial sources usually buy completed catalog records, not source 
data from which catalog records can be derived.) One immediate advantage of CIP 
is that it appears in the books being cataloged. A copy cataloger does not have to go 
beyond the material itself to find the CIP, although in some books the CIP record is not 
reproduced in full and only a record number is given. As mentioned, another advan-
tage is that CIP information is prepared by extremely knowledgeable catalogers and 
classifiers at the Library and Archives Canada, the Library of Congress, or the British 
Library. The disadvantage of CIP is that it does not appear in most nonbook materials, 
including digital materials. A library that relies on CIP alone must do original catalog-
ing for all other types of material. 
</p>
<p> 1. Searching and Retrieving Records 
to Copy from Source Databases 
</p>
<p> Copy catalogers are bound both by network contracts and by duty to search thor-
oughly for existing records that match their materials before entering new catalog re-
cords. The idea is to find existing records to copy. Good search techniques save more 
time than almost any other step of the copy cataloging process. 
</p>
<p> The best search request is one likely to match only one desired title and no others. 
This type of element is called a &bdquo;unique identifier,&permil; and several of these are given rou-
tinely in catalog records, among them International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) 
and Library of Congress Control Numbers (LCCNs). Sometimes searching unique 
identifiers retrieves multiple records. This can occur because of errors or because sev-
eral records are stored in the database for the same material. 
</p>
<p> When unique identifiers are absent from material being cataloged, or when they 
fail to return matching records, other search options must be tried. These include titles, 
the names of personal and corporate body authors, and series titles. Of these options, 
titles proper are most efficient, followed by the names of authors or series titles. Uni-
form titles might be necessary to search if the material being cataloged has one. Com-
binations of names and titles are better than titles alone or names alone. However, all </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Overview of the Operation 435
</p>
<p>of these elements can be expected to match multiple titles in the database and are less 
efficient than unique identifiers. 
</p>
<p> 2. Confirming Record Matches 
and Selecting a Source Record 
</p>
<p> Once one or more source records are identified as possible matches, the copy cat-
aloger must confirm an appropriate match. For example, if one is working with the 
OCLC database, the elements to be checked against the material in hand include the 
&bdquo;Type&permil; fixed field (for the format), &bdquo;Date&permil; fixed field, title statement, edition, publisher, 
and physical description. If all of these match the material, the record is likely to be 
a good match. If more than one record is a full match to these fields, the best source 
record should be selected, which is defined as the one most likely to contain full, high-
quality data (a national library record, a PCC library record, or a well-reputed network 
member, in that order). 
</p>
<p> Multiple matches sometimes include more than one national library record. In this 
event, prefer the record contributed by the one in the cataloger&Ecirc;s home country. 
</p>
<p> Sometimes incomplete matches are still useful. If a partial match contains the cor-
rect headings and title statements (for example, if the record is for a different edition 
of the same book) or differs in one or a few subelements (for example, if the record 
has the same title statement but names a different publisher), it can still be chosen and 
edited to correct the data that differ from the material in hand. When a partial match 
is finally produced, however, the copy cataloger must know whether the edited record 
should be designated a new record (permissible if it is, indeed, a record for a different 
material) or merely added to the original source record. 
</p>
<p> 3. Editing Data from the Source Records 
</p>
<p> Ideally, all data in the source record that does not match the material being cata-
loged should be edited. As a practical matter, however, not all data elements are equally 
important, and some elements might be allowed to remain as they appear in the source 
record, especially if they occur in the notes or in fields that do not display to members 
of the public. Data elements most likely to require editing include the following: 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Call numbers . Some local libraries routinely assign their own call numbers, 
using the source data merely for guidance. If local library policy is to accept 
national library classification numbers, shelf marks may still have to be ed-
ited, unless they are also accepted as assigned. Library of Congress records 
do not provide shelf marks for Dewey call numbers, for example, so these 
must be added. (Some libraries copy the shelf marks appearing in subfield b 
of the Library of Congress call number field.) Small libraries using Dewey 
call numbers might accept only the basic classification number but no ex-
pansions, or might accept only one expansion. Copy catalogers should be 
clear about policies governing both classification numbers and shelf marks. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Standard numbers and binding data . This information in source records 
might differ from materials being cataloged if, for example, the source record 
was for a hardcover version of a title and the material in hand is a paperback, 
or  vice versa.  Both kinds of information may appear in the source record, but </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>436 20&mdash;Copy Cataloging
</p>
<p>the local library chooses to accept only the data that match its material. In 
either instance, copy catalogers must edit the appropriate field. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Missing data . Information missing from source records entered as CIP, 
minimal-level cataloging, or order records can be added. Sometimes this 
means only adding data in the physical description field, but at other times 
more is needed, including subject headings and added entries. If standard 
numbers, subtitles, statements of responsibility, series, important notes, and 
other useful data are missing from the source record, local library policies 
can be to add or ignore them. Editing policy should state clearly which fields 
should be added, if the information is available, and which should be ignored. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Errors . Similarly, errors in the source records can be corrected. Some level of 
error can be tolerated in the interests of speeding up the process and saving 
money, but data used by local library patrons should be corrected the first 
time the record is used, not at a later time after problems occur. It is less 
expensive to make desired changes at once than to wait and revise records 
later. Editing policy should state clearly which fields should be corrected, 
if information in source records is wrong. At the very least, it seems sen-
sible to correct errors in headings and other searchable fields as well as in 
the edition statement, material specific details, and publication, distribution 
element. 
</p>
<p> 4. Entering Local Data 
</p>
<p> In addition to call numbers, other local information relating to newly acquired ma-
terials needs to be added before the records can be considered complete. A note about 
a strictly local matter might be added to notes or tracings, for example, the fact that an 
author was the town&Ecirc;s mayor from 1955 to 1958, or that a particular chapter contains 
information about the town&Ecirc;s history (a note and added subject heading). A whole cat-
egory of library-specific data includes acquisitions data (e.g., vendors from whom mate-
rials are purchased, prices, dates of order and delivery, funds to which they are charged, 
names of requesters) and circulation data (e.g., the call numbers, copy numbers, loan 
types). Much of this data is copy-specific and does not normally display on public cata-
log screen displays for patrons, although staff members can request it. 
</p>
<p> 5. Producing the Records 
</p>
<p> The final step in the process is producing completed records containing all the ed-
ited information desired by the local library for its catalog and other bibliographic files. 
When local records are uploaded to the database, the local libraries&Ecirc; identifications are 
added to the lists of holding libraries to show they own copies of the materials the records 
represent. This facilitates interlibrary loans. 
</p>
<p> Unless a local library is permitted to make permanent changes to the records con-
tributed by other libraries, the local edits do not alter or update source records when 
the local record is produced. If corrections are needed for the source records, copy 
catalogers are expected to file reports with the source database quality-control group 
that is responsible for updating the source records. </p>

<p>Review Questions 437
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> This chapter has covered the policies and procedures involved in cataloging mate-
rials by using existing catalog records as source copy, instead of starting from scratch 
and building a complete new record for each material acquired by the library. Many 
catalogers, particularly in those libraries buying mainstream materials likely to be cat-
aloged before publication by national libraries, are accustomed to using CIP as source 
copy. This is the most basic kind of copy cataloging. It is one step further to use other 
types of source copy, such as the catalog records contributed by members to biblio-
graphic network databases. 
</p>
<p> CIP records are also part of bibliographic network databases, where, in time, they 
are routinely upgraded with data that cannot be obtained before publication, such as 
the number of pages in a book or the number and types of illustrations a book contains. 
National library records are a valuable source of cataloging copy and are part of net-
work databases as well as being available directly in the MARC database. In addition, 
many librarians use records that are contributed to network databases by members 
doing original cataloging in their local libraries. Bibliographic networks also share 
data among themselves, tape-loading batches of records from a variety of sources into 
the databases. With tape loads data may be lost in the transfer process and, as a result, 
may furnish less complete records than those contributed by means of direct uploads 
from libraries doing the cataloging. 
</p>
<p> Issues that bear careful consideration are the sources a library accepts, the kind of 
editing done, and the amount of editing source records require before data can be en-
tered into the local library catalog. A whole range of options exists, from no editing to 
complete editing of every element that differs from data that would have been recorded 
had the local library done original cataloging. The trade-off in setting local policies is 
that doing no editing is quickest and cheapest, but it maximizes the number of errors in 
the local catalog. In contrast, doing complete editing takes longest and is most expen-
sive, but it maximizes the accuracy of the local catalog. 
</p>
<p> Most catalogers make decisions that strike a compromise between no editing and 
perfect editing&middot;for example, editing only those fields likely to affect retrieval or cause 
major confusion for searchers. At the same time, they try to find the best possible re-
cords to copy, which are contributed by libraries known for doing high-quality original 
work. The best safeguard for a local library&Ecirc;s catalog is having knowledgeable copy 
catalogers who recognize the difference between major and minor issues, and who, them-
selves, do high-quality copy cataloging.

<p>21    Processing Materials 
</p>
<p> Sharing is sometimes more demanding than giving. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Mary Catherine Bateson 
</p>
<p> After analog materials&middot;that is, materials whose physical formats consist of tan-
gible objects such as books, videos, sound recordings, maps&middot;have been cataloged and 
classified, they are prepared for use. The preparation involves a set of procedures called 
&bdquo;processing.&permil; 1  Processing has two purposes&middot;adding needed information to the materi-
als and preserving them so they can be used for as long as the library wishes to do so. 
Generally, three kinds of information, which will be discussed in more detail later in 
this chapter, need to be added to the materials: 
</p>
<p>  1. Evidence of ownership 
  2. Location information 
  3. A way to record and track use. 
</p>
<p> Some processing, such as putting clear plastic covers over the dustcovers of hard-
cover books, reinforcing or rebinding paperbacks, placing maps and pictures between 
sheets of plastic (called &bdquo;encapsulating&permil;), is done to protect the materials from dam-
age and lengthen their shelf lives. This work can be done in-house or it can be out-
sourced to wholesalers from whom the library buys its materials. 
</p>
<p> Materials that come in unusual shapes and sizes sometimes require repackaging to 
facilitate storage and use. Because information agencies of all kinds consist largely of 
books and/or book-like materials, book stacks are the standard storage method. This 
makes it difficult to handle materials that come in formats other than books. And, even 
when different kinds of storage units (e.g., cabinets, oversize drawers) are made avail-
able for oddly shaped or sized materials, they still need the same kinds of identification 
and usage data added. Special packaging for nonbook formats such as discs and reels </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>440 21&mdash;Processing Materials
</p>
<p>has improved since these kinds of materials began to be collected by libraries and me-
dia centers in the mid-20th century, but satisfactory processing still takes creativity. 
</p>
<p> Processing involves making physical additions and/or changes to the materials. 
Therefore, when processing decisions are made, librarians and media specialists should 
be sensitive to possible unintended consequences of their actions. There are trade-offs 
between actions that achieve the desired goals with minimal invasiveness but are easy 
to alter, and actions that are irreversible but possibly hasten the physical deterioration 
of the materials over time. Processing decisions need to balance the desire to maintain 
the integrity of materials and extend their longevity with the desire for clear identifi-
cation and substantial security. 
</p>
<p> EVIDENCE OF LIBRARY OWNERSHIP 
</p>
<p> Ownership marks and other strategies for identifying owners of books typically 
include one (or sometimes more than one) of the following: 
</p>
<p>  1. Stamping the owner&Ecirc;s name in the books, usually in indelible ink 
  2. Pasting bookplates inside the books 
  3. Pasting other kinds of labels bearing the owner&Ecirc;s name inside the books 
  4. Embossing pages in the books with an ownership mark. 
</p>
<p> Stamping names on books is extremely common. The favorite places to stamp 
are inside the covers of books and pamphlets, user guides, and so on; on the edges 
of the pages (known as edge-stamping); and on title pages. Sometimes, a randomly 
selected page within a book is also stamped as added insurance against theft. Because 
title pages and covers can be removed with relative ease and doing so does not affect 
the main texts, edge-stamping tends to be favored. Readers don&Ecirc;t see the stamp while 
they are reading, and most or all of the textblock bears the evidence (see Figure 21.1), 
making it more difficult for a thief to obscure or remove it. Depending on the chemi-
cal composition of the ink used for the imprints, stamps are more or less harmful to the 
materials on which they are used.    
</p>
<p>Figure 21.1. Edge-stamped book.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Evidence of Library Ownership 441
</p>
<p> Pasting library or school media center bookplates into books and book-like ma-
terials is another method of declaring ownership (see Figure 21.2). In earlier times, 
bookplates might be works of art, carefully designed to embellish and beautify the 
owner&Ecirc;s name, sometimes hand painted and highly ornamented. Even in the 21st cen-
tury, bookplates bearing classic designs are manufactured and sold to book lovers (or 
libraries) wishing to mark their materials in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. Book-
plates may be ordered with preprinted names or with blank spaces where names can 
be added (see Figure 21.3). Bookplates generally are better looking than stamps and 
carry on a genteel tradition of establishing ownership. It is not uncommon for research 
libraries to use bookplates to identify specific collections funded by respected donors, 
who are rewarded for their generosity by having their names associated for all 
time with the objects of scholarship they fund. Depending on the chemical composition 
of the adhesives used to paste bookplates to materials, they may be more or less harm-
ful for the materials on which they are used.    
</p>
<p> Because bookplates can be costly and are relatively large, some libraries and me-
dia centers may find them impractical to use on all their materials, especially on 
small objects such as paperback books, DVDs and CDs, sound tapes, and the like. 
For many years, library suppliers have offered smaller labels bearing an agency&Ecirc;s name 
for such materials or all materials if the agency chose to use them (see Figure 21.4). 
Small labels come in different shapes and many sizes&middot;some of them only a centimeter 
(or less) in width or  diameter.
</p>
<p> Another strategy for identifying printed materials&middot;especially books&middot;as library 
property is embossing a library name or institutional logo on one or more of the 
pages. These marks, while invasive and irreversible, are less obvious than stamps or

<p>Location Information 443
</p>
<p>bookplates and may even be considered aesthetically attractive. They have the added 
advantage of using no inks or adhesives. Libraries in colleges and universities some-
times use their institutional seal for this purpose, but at other times a special image is 
created that includes words to the effect that the embossed item belongs to Library X 
or Media Center Y. The principal drawback to embossing pages is that they are easily 
removed if a person is scheming to steal the material. 
</p>
<p> Still another strategy for displaying ownership is marking materials with indel-
ible markers. For example, Cornell University Library&Ecirc;s processing guidelines state: 
&bdquo;DVDs and CDs should be processed according to each library&Ecirc;s requirements. The 
call number should be written on the label side of one sided (one side silver and one 
side with label) CDs and DVDs with a permanent marker and a specially designed 
CD security strip applied to the disc on the label side. For two sided discs, do not write 
on the disc itself; the call number should be written on the inner circular area. Do not 
tattletape. A computer-generated label is applied to the spine of the case, preferably, 
if not, to the upper left side of the front of the case.&permil; 2  
</p>
<p> Overall, some sort of ownership evidence is needed. It is unusual for libraries or 
media centers to allow materials to circulate that bear no markings or labels to show 
who owns them. Sometimes, several methods are used simultaneously. 
</p>
<p> LOCATION INFORMATION 
</p>
<p> Information about where material is stored within the library&Ecirc;s collections is as 
important as evidence that it belongs to the library. This means putting call numbers 
in visible places on the materials so they can be shelved in the right locations. Labels 
imprinted with call numbers are typically affixed to the spines of books, bound vol-
umes of periodicals, and materials in other formats that have the space for them. Labels 
imprinted with call numbers are also made in different sizes and shapes intended for 
use with nonbook materials. These can be purchased from library supply houses and 
applied to materials in-house; or, for a small fee, wholesalers can arrange to label the 
materials before they are delivered to the library. 
</p>
<p> One problem that occurs is the call-number labels placed on the outer spines of 
books wear out at the edges and start to peel off before the material&Ecirc;s usefulness to 
patrons is over. Many libraries reinforce the spine labels of books before putting them 
out on the shelves by covering them with clear tape. This cannot be done so easily 
with certain types of nonbook materials, such as sound recordings on CD and vide-
orecordings on DVD, but specialized labels for such materials are not subjected to the 
same kinds of wear and tear from shelving and reshelving, or movements of the spine 
as books are opened and shut. 
</p>
<p> A different problem occurs when book spines are too narrow to hold standard sized 
spine labels. 3  In this event, labels usually are placed on the outside of the front cover. 
Again, protective clear tape may be applied over the label to secure it. The call number 
label cannot be read unless the book is pulled out of its place on the shelf, which sub-
jects it to added wear and, depending on where on the cover the label is placed, more 
or less manipulation to see it. The lower left-hand corner requires the smallest amount 
of removal from the shelf, but the right-hand corners&middot;both upper and lower&middot;are 
where the eye typically focuses when the book is used. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>444 21&mdash;Processing Materials
</p>
<p> Like books with narrow spines, the jewel cases in which CDs and DVDs are 
stored are too narrow to support standard spine labels, but these can be placed on the 
front of the case. Some libraries arrange the jewel cases like books; others put them in 
wide bins, proportioned so the cases can be stacked facing out. When the latter is the 
storage venue, call number labels on the front of the jewel case are the best choice. 
</p>
<p> Books-on-tape tend to be packaged by their publishers as if they were books and 
do not present special spine-label problems, but individual cassette tapes in small 
plastic boxes need a different label. Videorecordings on cassettes are also packaged in 
boxes wide enough to take a standard-sized book label and present no special labeling 
problems. Maps and drawings are often stored in oversized drawers in large cabinets 
so the materials can be laid flat without folding. If this is how they are stored, call-
number labels can be affixed to the individual sheets. 
</p>
<p> Boxed games and kits that consist of numerous pieces in various shapes and 
sizes present a unique problem: whether to label all the pieces or just the container in 
which they are packaged. Decisions may be made on a case-by-case basis, depending 
on the number of pieces, their sizes and shapes, and the cost of replacing lost pieces. 
For example, a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle might be labeled only on the box, but a board 
game consisting of a small number of pieces might put call numbers on the individual 
pieces and on the box. Sometimes, the pieces of multipart materials that are received 
without adequate packaging are repackaged in boxes, folders, or bags, and call num-
ber labels are affixed to those containers. 
</p>
<p> Adding call numbers to materials is routine for most materials, but materials 
that depart from the norm pose challenges. The most important skills processors can 
have are flexibility and creativity in dealing with the variety of materials collected by 
libraries as well as a practical eye. 
</p>
<p> RECORDING AND TRACKING USE 
</p>
<p> The advent of computers in libraries enabled circulation departments to automate 
recording and tracking the use of library materials. During processing, barcodes are 
placed on materials to identify each separate item and the bibliographic and item data 
recorded in a database. Each person who wishes to borrow materials must have a li-
brary card bearing a barcode that identifies him as an eligible borrower. When the per-
son borrows materials, the material and user barcodes are linked to create borrowing 
transactions in a transaction database. Transaction data remain active until the materi-
als are returned. At that time, the links between the barcodes are marked for deletion. 
Additional programs to erase or overwrite the data may be required as well, but for all 
intents and purposes, the transactions are ended and the links between the material 
barcodes and the borrower barcodes are broken. Some libraries have introduced an 
automated easy-to-use system where borrowers can check out materials without the 
intervention of library staff. 
</p>
<p> Systems using barcodes have many advantages: 
</p>
<p> &bull; All the data&middot;about the materials, borrowers, and transactions&middot;are always 
available to everyone with access to the database 
</p>
<p> &bull; The computer automatically notifies circulation staff when materials are 
overdue </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Preservation and Security 445
</p>
<p> &bull; Limits on borrowing eligibility can be programmed by the library into their 
computers; this automatically rejects those who exceed the limits 
</p>
<p> &bull; Barcodes, being much smaller than cards and pockets or slips of paper, can 
be used successfully not only on books and book-like materials, but also on 
a variety of smaller nonbook materials. 
</p>
<p> New digital technology goes beyond barcodes by providing protection against 
theft as well as borrowing and tracking information. Called radio-frequency identifi-
cation (RFID) systems, tags combine microchip and radio frequency technologies to 
identify and track analog materials within and outside of library buildings. 4  RFID 
systems involve putting tiny tracking devices on materials (the tags) that function the 
same way as bugs used by police, spies, and private detectives in crime fiction, movies, 
and television shows. 
</p>
<p> Pre-computer methods of recording and tracking use included putting cards and 
pockets labeled with identifying data in or on the materials. Borrowing transactions 
were recorded on the cards, which were, usually, filed in the library. Borrowers took 
away cards stamped with the due dates to remind them when to return the materials. 
Some systems stamped borrower information and due dates on a card that also iden-
tified the material. Some systems identified the borrowers by numbers rather than 
names. Doing so, however, meant the library had to keep a file of borrower numbers 
in addition to transaction files. Some systems microfilmed the borrower card, mate-
rial card, and transaction date. The library retained the images, which produced a list 
of identifying numbers and dates, and the borrower was given a due date card. When 
materials were returned, transaction numbers were crossed off the filmed list. Some 
systems did without cards and pockets altogether, gluing in slips of paper that could 
be stamped with due dates instead. 
</p>
<p> Computerized circulation systems are much less costly now than they were in the 
late 20th century, but some libraries still use noncomputerized methods. They must 
decide how to record borrowing data and provide due dates to borrowers. Once those 
decisions are made, they must decide whether to purchase the supplies and do the 
processing in-house or contract with an outside supplier to complete the procedures on 
the library&Ecirc;s behalf. Similarly, libraries using computerized systems using barcodes or 
RFID systems can purchase the supplies and do the work of affixing barcodes or tags 
and entering data in-house, or contract with an outside supplier to do it for them. 
</p>
<p> No matter what system is used to record and track the data, and no matter how the 
processing is done, users need to know when to return the materials they borrow. Some 
automated systems supply slips on which due dates are printed. However, not long 
ago, a circulation librarian remarked to one of the authors that even though her library 
had a high-tech circulation system involving fancy electronics, the people at the cir-
culation desk still relied on a &bdquo;dinosaur&permil;&middot;the date-due stamp&middot;to tell borrowers when 
their materials were to be returned. 
</p>
<p> PRESERVATION AND SECURITY 
</p>
<p> Two more topics warrant consideration in processing: preservation and secu-
rity. Preserving library materials, particularly books and other paper-based materi-
als, involves minimizing the stresses that cause them to deteriorate. At the same time </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>446 21&mdash;Processing Materials
</p>
<p>processors work to provide clear evidence of library ownership, location, and usage, 
they can use products and procedures that cause the least stress on the materials. Impor-
tant considerations are 
</p>
<p> &bull; avoiding potentially corrosive inks, glues, tapes, and inserts made of acidic 
paper; 
</p>
<p> &bull; making sure that markings and labels do not obscure information on the 
inside covers of books, blurbs and descriptions on boxes, and so on; and 
</p>
<p> &bull; choosing the least invasive and obtrusive methods of accomplishing pro-
cessing goals. 
</p>
<p> Some stresses on materials are environmental, such as excessive heat and/or hu-
midity, large swings in temperature and humidity, the presence of pests and air pollut-
ants, exposure to ultraviolet light, and storing materials on shelves made of materials 
that give off acids. Processing cannot do much about these matters. People cause other 
stresses, such as damage to books, warped and broken plastic discs, and lost pieces 
from kits and games. Processors can do a few things to address those problems, such as 
putting clear plastic sleeves on books, mentioned earlier in this chapter, to keep them 
clean. 
</p>
<p> Another aid to preserving materials that one of the authors has seen in practice falls 
under the heading of user education. In one library she visited, processors put labels 
on CD and DVD folders instructing borrowers how to handle the materials, such as 
not leaving the recordings in the sun or in a closed car on a hot day, not putting them 
on a radiator in cold weather, and&middot;important for digital materials&middot;keeping them out 
of strong magnetic fields. Cautions to keep books, maps, printed music, and similar 
paper-based materials dry in rainy weather are also added to the due dates stamped on 
bookmarks used by this library. 
</p>
<p> An important thing processors can do is to keep their stamps, labels, markings, 
barcodes, and so on as neat as possible, thereby setting a good example for everybody 
who sees them. Sloppy processing that looks as if things were slapped on materials in 
a hurry give off an image of carelessness, as if the library has no interest how materials 
are treated. If the library does not care, why should the borrowers? 
</p>
<p> Keeping materials in good condition for as long as possible includes preventing 
them from being stolen. Processing for security is usually done by inserting security 
strips in hidden places within the spines or gutters of books and printed periodicals. The 
strips emit electromagnetic frequencies that can set off alarms if they pass through a se-
curity gate without being desensitized. A similar, but more advanced technology is the 
RFID tag, discussed earlier. When activated, RFID tags can be monitored electronically 
wherever they are. When the tags are placed on library materials, library computers can 
track them continuously until the materials are brought back and the tags shut off and 
removed. 
</p>
<p> A small survey conducted in 2006 5  suggests that security strips and gates are used 
often, but some libraries do not use them fully. Others deploy security gates but do not 
insert the strips in their materials. They reason that library users do not know the strips 
are missing. Borrowers think alarms will sound at the gate, so they take the materi-
als to the circulation desk where desk clerks go through the motions of desensitizing 
them. Some of the survey responders said they were considering switching to RFID 
technology. </p>

<p>Notes 447
</p>
<p> SUMMARY 
</p>
<p> This chapter examined the goals of physical processing and selected methods li-
braries use to accomplish them. Goals include providing clear evidence of libraries&Ecirc; 
ownership of materials, location information, and usage data such as borrower and 
transaction information. Establishing policies to guide these functions and supervising 
staff that carry them out are among a technical services manager&Ecirc;s duties. 
</p>
<p> Standard methods are generally geared toward dealing with books and materials 
packaged like books&middot;materials that can stand on shelves in book stacks. Processing 
nonbook materials that come in unusual shapes and sizes takes creativity and ingenuity 
flavored with a large pinch of practicality. 
</p>
<p> Two other issues merit the processor&Ecirc;s attention, namely, preservation and security. 
Preservation measures include using the least-damaging processing products and pro-
cedures, doing processing work neatly, and adding instructions about handling materi-
als properly. Security measures typically include placing electromagnetic security strips 
inside materials that set off alarms if they are not desensitized before borrowers walk 
through a security gate to exit the library building. RFID, a newer digital technology, 
is beginning to supersede security strips and gates. Once activated, the tags of RFID 
systems give off radio frequencies that can be continuously monitored. 
</p>
<p> Processing usually is the final step before materials are made available to members 
of the public. If it is done well, the materials can be used for long periods of time, yet 
remain in good condition. Should damage occur, materials are sometimes returned to 
the processing staff for repair, rebinding, repackaging, and reprocessing. 
</p>
<p> REVIEW QUESTIONS 
</p>
<p>  1. Describe three methods libraries use to show that they own materials and 
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method. 
</p>
<p>  2. What function do barcodes serve? 
</p>
<p>  3. If processors aim to extend the length of time that materials are usable, what 
kinds of measures can they take to preserve them? 
</p>
<p>  4. What environmental conditions contribute to the deterioration of books and 
other printed materials? 
</p>
<p>  5. What is RFID and how does it work to protect library materials?

 Leading the 
</p>
<p>Catalog Department 
</p>
<p> A leader is a dealer in hope. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Napoleon I 
</p>
<p> The real leader has no need to lead&middot;he is content to point the way. 
</p>
<p> &middot;Henry Miller 
</p>
<p> Responsibility for the catalog department may rest with a department manager, 
with a group of people forming a management team or committee, or, in some in-
stances, with self-governing individuals. In a large measure, the size of the catalog 
department and its composition defines how it is led. In addition, the traditions of 
the library in which the department operates influence the form that its management 
takes. Authority and responsibility for setting policies, organizing and directing 
operations, monitoring outputs, evaluating the work, and reporting the results to 
the library&Ecirc;s administration needs to be undertaken and carried out on an ongoing 
basis. 
</p>
<p> Large libraries that do a great deal of new cataloging and employ many catalogers 
at different staff levels often assign management tasks to one person&middot;typically a 
degree-holding librarian&middot;as his or her primary job. In some libraries, the catalog depart-
ment is organized into one or more teams, where each team is given decision-making 
powers over its part of the whole operation. In small libraries and media centers, the role 
of manager is more likely to be assumed by the same person responsible for managing 
other functions and services. No matter what form department management takes, how-
ever, the ultimate aim is the same: to ensure that cataloging and classification operations 
are performed properly and in a timely manner, and that they follow established policies 
and produce the expected results. </p>
<p/>

<p>450 22&mdash;Leading the Catalog Department 
</p>
<p> MANAGEMENT TASKS 
</p>
<p> The tasks described in this section are required of the catalog department man-
ager, the management team, or the individuals managing a portion of the department&Ecirc;s 
work. They have less to do with cataloging and classification than with managing the li-
brary as a whole, or, for that matter, managing operations of any kind. They include the 
following: 
</p>
<p>  1.  Staffing &middot;recruiting personnel, training and integrating them into the staff, 
supervising their work, and evaluating both the work and each staff mem-
ber&Ecirc;s overall performance (such as reliability, promptness, adaptability) 
for the purposes of salary determination, promotion, and so forth. 
</p>
<p>  2.  Budgeting &middot;preparing budgets periodically, monitoring expenditures, and 
supplying the library or media center director with a financial report at the 
end of the budget period (usually a year). 
</p>
<p>  3.  Planning &middot;proposing departmental goals and objectives and how depart-
mental operations should proceed; devising workflow routines and all 
procedures for accomplishing the work of the department; and, when nec-
essary, thinking up and trying new methods for getting the work done. 
</p>
<p>  4.  Decision making &middot;taking the risk of choosing among alternative goals and 
objectives, potential plans or proposals, policies, strategies, procedures, 
suppliers, staff members and staff assignments, budgets, and so forth for 
the department, and ensuring that all decisions made are consistent with 
the policies set by those who govern the media center or library. 
</p>
<p>  5.  Directing &middot;taking charge, assigning tasks, arranging for things to be done 
properly, ensuring that people are functioning effectively, and providing 
leadership for the department 
</p>
<p>  6.  Evaluating&middot; reviewing activities and measuring production, with special 
attention to quality, speed, and costs 
</p>
<p>  7.  Reporting&middot; writing reports about department activities, production, 
staff, and budgets, and sending them to the appropriate administrative 
supervisor(s) 
</p>
<p> NEEDED SKILLS 
</p>
<p> Knowledge of cataloging and classification is essential for a department manager to 
perform the tasks listed earlier. Other skills that are needed do not involve bibliographic 
information. These include communication skills, political skills, financial skills, and 
leadership skills. 
</p>
<p>  Communication skills &middot;both speaking and writing&middot;are important to convey one&Ecirc;s 
ideas to staff members, peers, superiors, and others. Members of the cataloging depart-
ment need training to do their work, especially when they are first hired. Even if new 
catalogers are skilled at cataloging and classification, the local situation must be ex-
plained and any special rules and procedures described. This will be particularly impor-
tant if the person has come from a different type of library. All department employees </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Needed Skills 451
</p>
<p>need to know what is expected of them, the meaning of policies, and how to follow local 
procedures. 
</p>
<p> When a search for a new cataloger is conducted, the department manager may 
be expected to write, edit, or contribute to the wording of the job description. When 
selected candidates are brought to the institution for on-site interviews, the department 
manager is often (or should be) a major participant, describing the work of the depart-
ment and asking questions to determine the candidate&Ecirc;s knowledge and suitability for 
the job. Once hired, the manager is often the one who helps the person get settled and 
learn to operate comfortably and effectively in the job. 
</p>
<p> The department manager must be able discuss the work of the department with the 
heads of other library departments, with administrators, and with peers at other librar-
ies. Often he or she must speak and write to suppliers, computer system vendors, and 
a variety of outsiders on whom the department depends for everything from paper and 
printer cartridges to contracts for access to online tools such as  Cataloger&Ecirc;s Desk-
top  and  WebDewey.  The department manager is responsible for gathering statistics and 
writing reports, evaluating staff and operations, writing and submitting proposals for 
new equipment, gaining approval for new policies, designing improved procedures, and 
keeping up correspondence for the department within and outside of the organization. 
</p>
<p>  Political skills  are defined here as the skills needed to get things done through people, 
and they are important for the cataloging department manager. By exercising political 
skills, the manager can succeed in getting administrators to recognize the department&Ecirc;s 
needs and approve its programs and budgets. These skills encompass being persuasive, 
putting forth ideas in ways that will appeal to decision makers, and being good at gaining 
support for new proposals. 
</p>
<p> Political skills help the department manager build consensus within the department 
on its goals and objectives and establish and maintain an esprit de corps   that helps the 
department run smoothly and gives its members a sense of satisfaction. Political skills 
are important in enabling the manager to play a leadership role&middot;putting forth ideas 
that can improve output; enhance the workplace environment; result in higher quality, 
more rapidly prepared, and/or less costly products&middot;and implement the ideas in a timely 
manner. Political skills are critical in avoiding conflicts when members of the depart-
ment are challenged or criticized, or when problems involving the department must be 
addressed. 
</p>
<p> Political skills have come under a cloud to some degree because of the selfish and 
unsavory machinations of some professional politicians and political operatives. But the 
positive aspects of being skillful at politics&middot;working agreeably with people, persuad-
ing them to bring good programs to fruition, and helping them achieve good results for 
the benefit of others, not just the politician&middot;are important to good management. 
</p>
<p>  Leadership skills,  as mentioned earlier, combine envisioning goals for the depart-
ment, imbuing others with the vision, and risking the decisions that make progress pos-
sible toward those goals. Any decision could prove to be right or wrong, and the person 
who makes decisions risks failure. If the cataloging department is to grow and change, 
develop and achieve, it must have leadership willing to take on the risks of making 
changes and trying new things. Management teams spread the obligation and the risk of 
leadership among the members of the team, but they do not eliminate them. Some teams 
are better prepared and more willing to take risks than individual managers; some are 
more reluctant to change the status quo. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>452 22&mdash;Leading the Catalog Department 
</p>
<p>  Financial skills  are necessary for planning the department&Ecirc;s budget, defending it 
successfully before higher authorities within the organization, monitoring expenditures, 
and evaluating the results at the end of the budget cycle. Even when managers do not 
create budgets, the task of overseeing department expenditures is always part of their 
jobs. Computer software is available to assist with the statistical work, but even the best 
software cannot substitute for an understanding of basic financial management pro-
cesses and techniques. The cataloging department manager should be able to determine 
the true costs and evaluate the total value of alternative expenditures, not just to learn 
the price of things. 
</p>
<p> DEPARTMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
</p>
<p> A written record of the policy decisions that govern cataloging and classification 
of materials and the library&Ecirc;s bibliographic services is essential for a number of reasons. 
First, such a record ensures continuity when members of the department change due 
to retirements and new hires. Second, the written record is available to consult when 
someone is not sure about how to proceed. An up-to-date, well-written manual can be 
the cornerstone of a library&Ecirc;s cataloging and classification operations. Developing such 
a manual takes time and effort, but the result is a valuable document that is helpful for 
all staff members, whether they perform cataloging and classification tasks or merely 
use bibliographic services to help patrons find what they want. A departmental manual 
can also help to highlight the way the mission of the library is served by its cataloging 
and bibliographic services. 
</p>
<p> A bibliographic policy manual should begin with a brief description of the library&Ecirc;s 
community, school, or organization being served; an official mission statement; and 
a summary of its facilities, staff, collections, and patrons. Putting these elements at 
the beginning clarifies the setting and context in which the policies operate. Any obvi-
ous discrepancies observed at this point between the setting, its mission, and the poli-
cies contained in the document need to be resolved before continuing to describe the 
details. 
</p>
<p> Next, a section for each part of the bibliographic system, arranged in any order 
that seems logical to the staff, should include the decisions pertaining to that part along 
with a brief explanation of when and why they were made. There is no one right way to 
organize policy documents. Popular arrangements are chronological, by material for-
mat, and functional. In a chronological arrangement, policies cover the steps of the 
workflow, from the receipt of materials in the department, through the steps of cata-
loging, classification, processing, shelving, and deacquisition. In a manual organized 
by material format, policies cover books, videos, databases, maps, serials, and so on. 
Functionally organized manuals divide the policies into those that concern original and 
copy cataloging, with appropriate sections about bibliographic description and access, 
the assignment of subject descriptors, classification and shelflisting, and processing. 
</p>
<p> The local library manual is probably best organized by the kind of workflow used 
in the department. If the first step when materials are received is to choose whether to 
send them to a department&Ecirc;s books, audiovisuals, or serials cataloging unit, format-
related organization makes sense. Sections for each format can cover the policy de-
cisions related to those materials. Videos might require being scanned for important </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Department Policies and Procedures 453
</p>
<p>bibliographic elements, subject matter, etc., whereas sound recordings might require 
only filling in data from labels and accompanying materials. Books lacking Cataloging 
in Publication (CIP) or network records might be cataloged immediately or put in a 
queue to be searched again after a brief waiting period in hopes of locating an existing 
record to copy. Serials-control software might require very different policies involving 
ongoing procedures. 
</p>
<p> If all materials follow the same path through the department, chronological order 
makes sense. Following the library&Ecirc;s standard operating procedures from start to finish 
and documenting the policy decisions for each step seems like the best way to handle 
this type of workflow. Small libraries are most likely to have this kind of workflow, not 
large ones in which specializations in cataloging one type of material format seems 
more likely. Small general libraries buying mainstream materials probably do copy 
cataloging for most of their materials, with, perhaps, only a small percentage of local 
history or local-interest materials requiring original cataloging. 
</p>
<p> If the first decision when materials are received is whether to go to original or copy 
cataloging, policies governing that choice become the manual&Ecirc;s first section. Methods 
of searching, matching, capturing, and editing existing records from a source database 
are outlined. Because every change made to a derived record adds cost, policy decisions 
should guide the use of bibliographic records as is to the greatest extent possible. Man-
dated changes written into the policy should be scrutinized periodically to ensure that 
their benefits exceed their costs. 
</p>
<p> The section on original cataloging might begin with descriptive cataloging, speci-
fying the level of description for various types of materials, the authority control system, 
the way items that are part of a series will be treated (that is, cataloged and classified 
separately or as a collection at the series level), whether some or all series titles will be 
traced, if or when multipart items will be analyzed (that is, provided with separate cata-
log records for each part), and when uniform titles will be adopted. Catalogers might 
decide to furnish analytic records for electronic resources in which the individual files 
may be used singly, but only one overall record for electronic resources in which the 
files are used in concert. Different descriptive treatments for each material format might 
be specified; for example, collections of tests or college catalogs might be given first-
level descriptions, while reference and research materials might be given second-level 
descriptions. Policy decisions about optional identifying data, the addition or deletion 
of descriptive access points, and so forth should be documented. 
</p>
<p> The next section might deal with subject headings, starting with the sources for 
descriptors, the number of descriptors typically assigned, the desired depth of indexing, 
and any special treatments accorded to particular materials. For example, if broad head-
ings are desired for a small collection,  Library of Congress Subject Headings  might be 
adopted as the source list for descriptors, but subdivisions (that is, subheadings) might 
be omitted for all but a few subject areas in which holdings are relatively abundant. 
Some materials might be indexed analytically, with descriptors assigned for each part of 
a multipart item, each chapter of a book, or each cut on a sound recording. 
</p>
<p> The section on classification might indicate the chosen system used, the level of 
complexity within the system, and the way hard-to-classify materials such as periodi-
cals and databases are treated. The method of assigning cutter letters or numbers and 
styles of adding these and other shelf marks to the classification number to complete 
the call number should be described. The choice between creating unique call numbers </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>454 22&mdash;Leading the Catalog Department 
</p>
<p>for each item or allowing more than one item to share the same call number needs to 
be documented here. Desired anomalies in the shelving arrangement should be noted, 
such as keeping new acquisitions in a prominent display for a month or two; housing 
oversized books on special shelves; or dividing materials by instructor, grade level, 
class, and so on. 
</p>
<p> Explanations for the decisions recorded in the policy document enable new mem-
bers of the department to understand the reasoning behind them and, as conditions 
change, to recognize when it is time to make changes. 
</p>
<p> Every manual needs regular review to determine whether the policies it mandates 
should be changed. Annual or biennial policy reviews might seem unnecessary when 
new policies are instituted, but they are a wise measure. Frequent reviews head off 
crises caused by following outmoded policies. If the reviewers take this responsibility 
seriously and examine every part of the document thoroughly&middot;from the prefatory de-
scriptions, through each section of the main text, to the closing amendment process&middot;
they have a chance of anticipating needed changes before a crisis occurs. 
</p>
<p> Adding descriptions of procedures to the statements of policy decisions is optional, 
but can be useful, especially if department management is decentralized among mem-
bers of a team or individual catalogers and classifiers. Explanations of procedures, often 
in one or more separate manuals, are no substitute for a policy manual. The procedures 
manual needs only to spell out the steps of departmental operations, but not the policy 
decisions that underlie them or the reasons why those decisions were made. Nonman-
agement workers need to know what to do, but they may or may not have to know 
why they do it. Depending on the composition of the staff and the numbers of people 
involved, combining policies and procedures into one manual makes sense. While man-
agers do not want to overload staff members with extraneous information they do not 
need to do their jobs, understanding the overall goals and reasoning behind the tasks can 
make their work more meaningful and satisfying. 
</p>
<p> Procedures seem best when they follow the chronological order of steps involved, 
but there is no reason why separate processes can&Ecirc;t be arranged in any order. One way 
to arrange the procedures manual is by physical medium, another is by bibliographic 
function, and a third is simply to put the procedures in alphabetical order by name. Pro-
cedures can also be arranged together with the policies to which they relate. No mat-
ter what the arrangement of the procedures manual, it should be possible to locate an 
individual procedure easily. Thus, if the manual is arranged by function, it should have 
an alphabetic index by title; and if it is arranged alphabetically by the names of the pro-
cedures or by physical medium, there should be a functionally organized list of contents 
provided as well. 
</p>
<p> WHEN CATALOGING STANDARDS CHANGE 
</p>
<p> An important set of decisions that should be included in the policy manual is the 
response to changes in the cataloging tools used by the library. When new rules for 
descriptive cataloging and new subject and classification authorities appear, how will 
they be adopted and implemented? Such changes occur regularly, because all catalog-
ing tools follow policies of continuous revision, so it should be acknowledged and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When Cataloging Standards Change 455
</p>
<p>strategies developed for their implementation. Among several possible responses are 
the following: 
</p>
<p>  1.  Make all required changes for all holdings immediately.  This is the most 
desirable option for keeping the entire collection together in one style of 
organization and completely up to date, but it is the most costly alternative, 
both in terms of dollars and cents and the amount of staff time it will con-
sume in the short run. 
</p>
<p>  2.  Make no changes in existing holdings, but implement the changes for new 
materials immediately.  This is the strategy followed by many librarians, 
because it seems to be the best that can be done with limited resources. 
The problem with this strategy is that over time, even just a few years, the 
organization of the library starts to break down. What emerges is not one 
unified collection, but several fragmented collections, each following dif-
ferent rules. This was the strategy of choice for many libraries when they 
automated; when it finally became necessary to incorporate the older hold-
ings into the automated system, it was a huge job that cost much more than 
had been anticipated. 
</p>
<p>  3.  Make all changes over a limited period of time.  This strategy seems to be 
the most reasonable when circumstances don&Ecirc;t permit the first approach, 
because all the materials remain in one unified organizational structure, 
even though the structure will take on different aspects as various changes 
are implemented. It probably has the best payoff in the long run, because 
it will ultimately result in the same organizational effectiveness as the first 
option but will not require as large an investment at once; however, it usu-
ally ends up costing more than implementing all the changes immedi-
ately. 
</p>
<p>  4.  Make changes selectively.  This strategy also is popular with practitioners 
and can be the best overall strategy when changes in cataloging rules, 
subject descriptors, and classification schemes do not affect local library 
holdings to a great extent. For example, some years ago when numbers in 
the Dewey classification&Ecirc;s music schedule changed radically, a library that 
did not buy many items about music and whose music holdings consisted 
solely of a few works about music appreciation, might have decided not 
to implement the changes that appeared in the 20th edition. This strategy 
can lead to future problems, however, should the discrepancies become 
more significant over time or should the local library begin to collect music 
materials in larger quantities. Still, if a greatly enlarged music collection 
is established, the decision can be made to implement the newer Dewey 
numbers at the same time. 
</p>
<p>  5.  Make no changes and continue using older editions of tools.  This strat-
egy is deceptively simple, easy, and cheap. Sooner or later, however, it 
breaks down completely because it lacks the capacity to keep up with 
changes in materials, subject matter, and user needs. Moreover, it causes 
the local library to grow further and further out of step with the rest of the 
library community. When the moment finally arrives that librarians real-
ize that something must be done, it will cost a great deal more to address </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>456 22&mdash;Leading the Catalog Department 
</p>
<p>the changes and implement new policies than when the changes first oc-
curred. 
</p>
<p> Each of these alternatives&middot;and they are not the only ones possible&middot;has advan-
tages and disadvantages, and each will have a different result both in the short term and 
over the long run. The first option seems like an ideal response, but it is the most costly; 
and although the last option is the least costly in the short run, it probably will result 
in the least effective service to patrons, even though the problems might not become 
apparent for some time. The other options fall somewhere between these extremes, 
and libraries must weigh the alternatives in terms of their individual situations and the 
impact on budgets, staff, and patron services. 
</p>
<p> WRITING A POLICY MANUAL 
</p>
<p> No matter how a department&Ecirc;s management is configured, one person should be 
tapped to write the manual. This minimizes the possibility that individual differences in 
style and language will produce sections using different words for the same concepts, 
using the same words for different concepts, and other potentially confusing language 
problems. Over time, more than one person may write and/or edit sections of the man-
ual, but at any one time, one person should be assigned this responsibility. 
</p>
<p> A good way to begin preparing the policy manual is to draw up a table of contents 
and circulate it among staff for suggestions about additions or changes to be made. It 
might be wise to indicate that just because suggestions are solicited does not mean they 
will automatically be followed. If major differences arise, negotiation can produce an 
acceptable solution so that the manual is a source of agreement, not contention. The 
table of contents, once defined, establishes the scope of the manual and identifies the 
way the whole bibliographic system will be divided and addressed. 
</p>
<p> Writing the manual might begin by listing all the decisions and operations to be 
covered within each section and circulating the list for input from other department 
members. For example, decisions relating to materials issued in series could be listed 
under &bdquo;Descriptive Cataloging,&permil; &bdquo;Tracing Practice,&permil; &bdquo;Indexing,&permil; and &bdquo;Classification,&permil; if 
the manual is divided functionally, or under &bdquo;Series&permil; or &bdquo;Monographic Series,&permil; if it is 
divided by types of material. Either way, all the decisions relating to the handling of 
series must be covered somewhere in the manual. For the user&Ecirc;s convenience, an index 
can bring together related information that falls into different sections or chapters (that 
is, to bring together all the descriptive cataloging decisions when the division is by mate-
rial type, or all the decisions relating to series when the division is by function). Word 
processing software enables indexes to be created automatically, making this a relatively 
easy task. When the manual combines policies and procedures, similar handling of pro-
cedures also has to be done. 
</p>
<p> When the decisions (and operations) to be covered are listed, but before actual 
writing begins, questions about the style of the presentation should be asked and an-
swered. Some are as simple as whether one or both sides of a page should be used; 
whether sources will be cited at the bottom of pages or as endnotes; and whether illus-
trative examples, flowcharts, tables, and so forth will be given within text or as separate 
pages or sections. These decisions might sound trivial, but they affect the ease with </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Adopting the Policy Manual 457
</p>
<p>which the manual can be updated; the size of the completed document (&bdquo;document&permil; is 
used as a generic term here; the manual need not be a book&middot;it could be a database); 
the ease with which it can be consulted, excerpted, or duplicated; its applicability to the 
task of training new staff; and similar issues. Other decisions include the approach to 
describing operations, as step-by-step procedures or straight narratives; the amount and 
types of illustration; the inclusion or exclusion of supporting material (such as quoting 
Library of Congress rule interpretations in full or citing the page in a different document 
on which the interpretation appears); and so forth. 
</p>
<p> Once the questions are answered and the content, approach, and style are clearly 
defined, writing can begin. If the designated author is knowledgeable in all the areas 
covered by the manual, he or she can begin writing each part, section, and chapter, com-
pleting them according to an agreed-upon schedule. If the manual includes policies or 
procedures that the writer does not know well, these should be written jointly with a 
knowledgeable guide, or another person should submit a draft to the writer, who puts it 
into final format. Either way, as each part is written, it is wise to circulate drafts among 
staff members who are expected to use them, or who actually perform the tasks, to be 
certain the text is clear and understandable. The writer should expect to edit the work not 
only to account for solicited feedback from staff members, but also to enhance, clarify, 
sharpen, and polish the text, based on her own re-readings. 
</p>
<p> When enough of the manual is completed to warrant its distribution, the first few 
months (or longer) of its use should be considered a test run to see how well it functions. 
It might be issued in chapters or sections, or only after completion of the whole. With ac-
tual use, however, unanticipated problems can arise, which usually must be resolved by 
revising the language, examples or illustrations, finding aids, and so on. Occasionally, 
enough difficulty is encountered to prompt reconsidering the basic organization, format, 
or style, and to suggest doing a major overhaul. If this happens, it is best to weigh the 
true need for a total revision versus continuing to try making the existing manual work. 
The first version of a manual need not be the last, but the difficulties should be evaluated 
carefully and estimates made that changes in style or approach can achieve the desired 
improvement before discarding an existing document. It is realistic to expect several 
months of revision to follow issuing any new manual to discover and work out all its 
bugs. The problems are no one&Ecirc;s fault. Revision is inherent in the process of obtaining 
an effective manual. 
</p>
<p> ADOPTING THE POLICY MANUAL 
</p>
<p> When the policy manual is complete and satisfies department staff members, one 
more step is necessary before it is adopted. It is essential that administrators affirm the 
manual and the policies it presents. It will do little good to decide to put a bibliographic 
policy in place if those responsible for the library are unwilling to support its ideas, fund 
its implementation, and appreciate its value to the organization being served. Surpris-
ingly, even when library management and boards of directors are the ones to make the 
decisions, seeing those decisions incorporated into a departmental manual sometimes 
prompts objections. Perhaps the thinking of the people involved has changed. Perhaps 
the interpretation seems to have changed in the manual&Ecirc;s text. Whatever the reasons </p>

<p>458 22&mdash;Leading the Catalog Department 
</p>
<p>behind the objections, they must be resolved and official approval obtained before the 
manual can be adopted. 
</p>
<p> In connection with seeking administrative approval for policies, librarians must be 
prepared to document the goals and priorities served by particular policies, know their 
costs, and defend the expenditures. Whether or not a costly change is being considered, 
it is fair for an administrator to expect cataloging department managers to answer ques-
tions about the costs and benefits of bibliographic policies, to argue persuasively on 
behalf of proposed policies, and to negotiate compromise positions, when necessary. 
</p>
<p> CURRENT ISSUES 
</p>
<p> For several decades starting in the 1970s, the greatest challenge facing cataloging 
department managers was introducing computers into their operations and upgrading 
them as new hardware and software became available. Far from being a better producer 
of catalog cards, automation soon required reorganizing the workflow, retraining the 
staff, and incorporating all previous bibliographic data into the new computer-based 
systems being implemented. Among the profound changes that resulted are new patron 
services made possible by linking catalogs electronically. If a library or media center 
catalog is linked to the Internet, searchers can go beyond local library holdings to seem-
ingly limitless resources located all around the world. Internet services began in the 
1990s and have increased exponentially since then. 
</p>
<p> Locally, a computerized catalog can be linked to other internal information files 
within the organization, such as order files and circulation files, enabling searchers to 
determine the exact status of a desired title or when it is due to be returned if it is out on 
loan to a borrower. Because of this linkage, online public access catalogs, called OPACs 
for short, finally are able to answer library users&Ecirc; most basic question: Can I have this 
item? 
</p>
<p> As electronic resources become more sophisticated, the challenge to make optimal 
use of them has increased, putting pressure on library managers to continue making 
changes in the way locally managed holdings are cataloged, indexed, classified, and 
processed. Demand for high-quality cataloging continues unabated, but the digital revo-
lution has prompted the development of metadata&middot;cataloging of electronic resources 
stored in digital libraries. Hiring specialists who can prepare metadata to support local 
projects and can initiate, manage, and market digital library projects is not easy. Can-
didates with the requisite computer knowledge and library expertise are a small cohort, 
and libraries rarely offer enough compensation to woo them away from the business 
world. This and other computer-related issues continue to occupy cataloging depart-
ment managers&Ecirc; attention, mainly concerning the implementation of new releases for 
local library software and/or the purchase of newer integrated library systems, both 
of which involve implementation plans, including training department staff members, 
other library staff, and users in use of the new systems. 
</p>
<p> Another important issue is deciding whether maintaining an in-house cataloging 
operation is as effective as contracting with an outside service to provide the library 
with cataloging for new acquisitions and to maintain the catalog system. Called  out-
sourcing,  outside contracting has attracted much attention and prompted intense debate. 
Deciding whether to contract with cataloging sources outside the library or have the </p>

<p>Current Issues 459
</p>
<p>cataloging done by library employees requires careful consideration of many factors, 
including the cost, speed, and quality of the products, as well as control over local op-
erations and the availability of bibliographic expertise on the library&Ecirc;s staff. Options for 
outsourcing include commercial firms offering services based on ever-larger network 
databases, access to network databases, cataloging software, and hiring consultants on 
a project-by-project basis for collections requiring original cataloging. 
</p>
<p> What too many library directors fail to realize is the impact on the library of the 
potential loss of expertise that results from closing down cataloging departments and 
dispersing staff members having special bibliographic knowledge. The specialization 
that has developed over more than a century of library growth seems to have removed 
cataloging from all the services for which it is the foundation. Reference and informa-
tion services do not exist in a vacuum, divorced from cataloging. The catalog remains 
the primary reference tool for most people using local libraries, yet some librarians 
perceive it as just another database. When cataloging is obtained from outside sources, 
someone should be monitoring it on behalf of the library&middot;someone who has knowledge 
of both the local population and the local catalog. If this supervision disappears, control 
over local catalogs, which is greatly diminished by outsourcing, disappears entirely. 
</p>
<p> In the last decade, development of genre headings continued to the point that they 
are now assigned to many materials as a matter of course. Catalogs that use multiple 
subject authorities instead of just one are now common, especially among large libraries 
catering to a broad range of searchers, including offsite users. These changes have aug-
mented the vocabulary available to searchers for retrieving materials, especially non-
book materials, and have also encouraged catalogers to increase the number of headings 
they assign. Similarly, work has continued on revising and improving core standards 
for catalog records that offer less data, but equally high-quality data as in full records. 
Adopting core records for segments of the collection enables managers to stretch the 
output of understaffed departments. The goal of cataloging everything acquired by the 
library and avoiding backlogs is still merely an ideal in a good many places. 
</p>
<p> The difficulty of recruiting well-trained catalogers persists and is unlikely to change 
unless libraries with large cataloging departments offer meaningful incentives to attract 
more new professionals to the specialty. The mistaken notion that computers are doing 
original cataloging all by themselves, without human intervention, also persists, putting 
a damper on the likelihood that such incentives will soon appear. It may be just a mat-
ter of time until expert systems incorporating cataloging tools can create full standard 
records automatically, but it has not happened yet. In this book&Ecirc;s previous edition, the 
authors suggested that publishers could develop such expert systems and use them to 
add full cataloging to every item they issue as part of the publishing process, like CIP, 
but with greater control and accuracy. To date, they have not done so, nor have they even 
offered embedded metadata in their products other than CIP. Observers cannot help but 
hope the situation will change, perhaps in reaction to a burst of new electronic books 
and their readers. 
</p>
<p> Automating time-consuming cataloging processes can make it possible for cata-
logers to spend more time helping searchers find what they want, either in person or via 
online bibliographic services. User service is, after all, the object of cataloging. In the 
meantime, cataloging department managers must endeavor to employ computing and 
electronic access to accomplish the work that catalogers have performed in different ways 
since Callimachus classified texts in ancient times for the great library at Alexandria, </p>

</p>
<p> TEN HINTS FOR LEADERSHIP 
</p>
<p> Much of the advice in this chapter can be distilled into brief guidelines that catalog-
ing department managers would do well to heed. They include the following: 
</p>
<p>  1. Make basic decisions about bibliographic control policies, write them 
down, and stick to them until annual reviews give evidence that they need 
to be changed. When considering alternatives, keep in mind the needs of 
users, obligations to the network, and available budget and staffing. 
</p>
<p>  2. Trade-offs between quality and quantity require balancing doing the best 
job with doing the whole job. Allowing backlogs to grow while the depart-
ment&Ecirc;s resources are invested in doing more complex work than necessary 
should be absolutely forbidden. 
</p>
<p>  3. Have the tools to do a good job of cataloging. Acquiring an expensive ref-
erence tool pays off in the long run in the form of higher-quality catalog-
ing with less effort. 
</p>
<p>  4. Write down local rule interpretations and subject applications, and use 
them for all other cases of the same kind. 
</p>
<p>  5. Work on making copy cataloging true to its name. Examine what is being 
edited and updated as well as what materials are being cataloged from 
scratch and try to expedite the work. If given the opportunity to outsource 
some or all of the cataloging to a reliable vendor, be objective in analyzing 
the costs and benefits of doing so. 
</p>
<p>  6. Face problems and experiment with solutions. Own up to mistakes quickly 
and honestly, then move on to more successful options. Try not to promise 
output that perhaps cannot be delivered. 
</p>
<p>  7. Develop a support system, and work at both using it and contributing to it. 
Join the cataloging group in the state, provincial, regional, or national pro-
fessional association, and be active in it. Befriend colleagues in the library, 
in peer libraries, and in nearby libraries of all types; network partners and 
network representatives; and cataloging experts. Write for help to us and 
other authors of cataloging texts, user group and association leaders, catalog-
ing educators, and others. Professional education is an ongoing obligation, 
so do it. 
</p>
<p>  8. Be informed. Cataloging rules and tools are dynamic and are constantly 
accommodating new decisions. Read the literature, keep up with revisions, 
and take advantage of continuing education opportunities. 
</p>
<p>  9. Inform those who use the library and public-service staff members of deci-
sions and procedures, and seek their input before making changes. 
</p>
<p>  10.  Trust yourself!  Undoubtedly, no one in the organization knows more about 
bibliographic issues than you do. When in doubt, consult your network, but 
listen to your instincts about your library and its users. </p>

</p>
<p> PATRON SERVICE FIRST AND FOREMOST 
</p>
<p> Service to patrons is the ultimate object of all bibliographic policies and proce-
dures, and should be the main goal of department managers and all of their operations. 
Standard tools and processes are recommended in this book because the authors believe 
they furnish good service and benefit patrons. One of their greatest advantages is that 
they enable local libraries to share the work of their peers and participate in systems that 
reach far beyond their immediate territory. 
</p>
<p> Librarians can benefit by developing a positive attitude toward change and a bet-
ter grasp of how to implement new and creative ideas involving new technologies and 
methods. It behooves cataloging managers to realize that, ultimately, cataloging is a 
public service, and must be measured according to how well it performs for its users. 
</p>
<p> REVIEW QUESTIONS 
</p>
<p>  1. Identify three tasks that fall to the cataloging department manager and dis-
cuss the skills needed to accomplish them. 
</p>
<p>  2. Describe different types of department management and the advantages of 
each one. 
</p>
<p>  3. What budget responsibilities are part of the department manager&Ecirc;s job in most

ment manager? 
</p>
<p>  4. How should policy decisions be handled in the department? 
</p>
<p>  5. Describe the difference between policies and procedures. 
</p>
<p>  6. Who should write the department policy manual and how should that person 
obtain feedback from the rest of the members of the department? 
</p>
<p>  7. What responsibilities does the department manager have in the recruiting and 
hiring of new department staff members? 
</p>
<p>  8. When should department activities be evaluated?

<p> JEAN WEIHS has worked in university, public, school, and special libraries as a refer-
ence librarian, a bibliographer, and a school librarian. However, most of her career has 
been involved in cataloguing, both as a practitioner and a teacher of librarians, library 
technicians, and school librarians in Canada and as a visiting professor in the United 
States. She represented the Canadian Committee on Cataloguing for nine years on the 
Joint Steering Committee for Revision of AACR, five of these as JSC Chair.  Nonbook 
Materials: The Organization of Integrated Collections  (written with Shirley Lewis 
and Janet Macdonald, in consultation with the CLA/ALA/AECT/AMTEC Advisory 
Committee on the Cataloguing of Nonbook Materials) was one of the bases for the 
development of the present rules in AACR2. She has been the recipient of fourteen na-
tional and international awards including the Margaret Mann Citation in Cataloging and 
Classification, the Queen&Ecirc;s Jubilee Medal (given by the Governor General of Canada, 
nominated by the Canadian Library Association), and was the first recipient of the John 
Comaromi Lectureship. She has held 45 positions on national and international com-
mittees and has written or co-written 19 books, 5 separately-published pamphlets/docu-
ments, 14 chapters in books edited by others, and over 150 articles and book reviews in 
professional journals. </p>
