<p>AACR2 Revision 2002 </p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>PREFACE TO THE 2002 REVISION 
</p>
<p>The printed version of the 2002 revision of the second edition of the Anglo-American Cata-
loguing Rules (AACR) represents a milestone in the publishing history of the code. It is 
being issued as an integrating resource, in loose-leaf format for updating. Updates to the rules 
will be released annually. This is in recognition of the fact that changes to the rules are occur-
ring more frequently than in the past and are often substantial. 
</p>
<p>This revision incorporates the two sets of revisions published as Amendments 1999 and 
Amendments 2001. It also includes revisions approved through 2001 and finalized in 2002. 
Substantial changes have been made to three chapters: chapter 3 (Cartographic Materials), 
chapter 9 (Electronic Resources), and chapter 12 (Continuing Resources). An outline of the 
changes made within these chapters and in other parts of the rules may be found in the sum-
mary following this preface. A revised index has been compiled to reflect the changes and to 
correct errors in the 1998 revision. 
</p>
<p>The environment in which the code operates has undergone significant change since the 
second edition of the rules was published in 1978. The rise of the Internet and the increasing 
use and exchange of electronic resources have had a profound impact. User needs and expec-
tations are also evolving rapidly. In response to the challenges presented in this new environ-
ment, the Joint Steering Committee for Revision of AACR (JSC) has embarked on an ambi-
tious program of investigation and reform, beginning with the International Conference on 
the Principles and Future Development of AACR, held in Toronto in 1997. JSC has met regu-
larly in order to meet the deadlines of an increasingly demanding program of work. Six meet-
ings have been held since the International Conference in the following locations: Leeds, 
England (November 1998); Brisbane, Australia (October 1999); San Diego, United States 
(March 2000); London, England (September 2000); Washington, United States (April 2001); 
and, Ottawa, Canada (October 2001). 
</p>
<p>JSC would not be able to meet these increasing demands without the support of the dedi-
cated and hard-working community of the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules. The consulta-
tive nature of the rule revision process ensures that informed decisions are made and that 
there is a sound mandate for action. In addition to the considerable contribution made by the 
JSC members and members of the constituent bodies, certain individuals also make outstand-
ing contributions to the development of the code. Since the International Conference, notable 
contributions have been made by Tom Delsey, in his work on modelling AACR, and Jean 
Hirons, in her work on accommodating seriality in the rules. 
</p>
<p>I am confident that JSC, in conjunction with the Committee of Principals for AACR, will 
continue to take a strategic approach to planning the evolution of the code, and that as a 
result it will remain a viable standard for bibliographic description and access into the future.

<p>SUMMARY OF RULE REVISIONS SINCE 
AACR SECOND EDITION 1998 REVISION 
</p>
<p>This summary is not a detailed list of changes, but a list of the most significant changes in 
the 2002 amendments, the 2001 amendments, and the 1999 amendments incorporated into the 
current 2002 revision. 
</p>
<p>AMENDMENTS 2002 
</p>
<p>Deletion of rule 1.4D4 
</p>
<p>Rule I.4D4 has been deleted. This rule instructed that the name of the publisher, distributor, 
etc., appearing in a recognizable form in the title and statement of responsibility area, should 
be given in the shortest possible form in the publication, distribution, etc., area. The rule was 
judged to be unnecessary and inflexible, and to limit the use of the area for search and 
retrieval purposes by automated systems. Examples throughout AACR have been revised to 
reflect the deletion of the rule. 
</p>
<p>Chapter 3 (Cartographic Materials) 
</p>
<p>The changes to chapter 3 are of three major types: 
</p>
<p>&bull; additional rules or additions to existing rules for the description of cartographic materi-
als in electronic form; 
</p>
<p>&bull; miscellaneous changes to existing rules to bring them into line with current practice; 
&bull; editorial changes. 
</p>
<p>The first category is the most substantial, involving changes to the mathematical and other 
material specific details area (formerly: Mathematical data area). Three new rules were added: 
rule 3.3E (Type and extent of resource); rule 3.3F (Digital graphic representation); and, rule 
3.3G (Numbering related to serials). The overall goal is to enable more accurate description 
of cartographic materials that are electronic resources and/or continuing resources. Rule 3.3D 
(Statement of coordinates and equinox) has been changed to allow the recording of coordi-
nates in decimal degrees as well as in degrees, minutes, and seconds. Additional examples 
have been added to rule 3.7BS (Mathematical and other material specific details) to reflect the 
addition of rule 3.3F and the changes to rule 3.3D. 
</p>
<p>Changes in the second category include: the changing of "map section" to "section," and 
"relief model" to "model" in rule 3.5B 1; and, the addition of "layout," "production 
method," and "medium" as other physical details in rule 3.5Cl. 
</p>
<p>Editorial changes have been made as necessary to match new terminology and to reflect 
changes made in other chapters.

<p>SUMMARY OF RULE REVISIONS 
</p>
<p>Chapter 12 (Continuing Resources) and other related rules 
</p>
<p>The scope of chapter 12, now called "Continuing Resources" instead of "Serials," has been 
expanded to include resources that have either not been covered in the rules or not adequately 
covered. Chapter 12 now encompasses: 
</p>
<p>&bull; successively issued resources (i.e., serials); 
&bull; ongoing integrating resources (e.g., updating loose-leafs, updating Web sites); 
&bull; some categories of finite resources (i.e., reprints of serials, resources with characteristics 
</p>
<p>of serials but whose duration is limited, and finite integrating resources). 
</p>
<p>Because of the differences in treatment of the various types of continuing resources, the rules 
have been expanded to include separate provisions for serials and integrating resources or in 
some cases other subcategories of continuing resources such as printed resources, electronic 
resources, and updating loose-leafs. Additionally, separate rules addressing changes in spe-
cific data elements have been included. 
</p>
<p>Rules in other chapters affected by the changes in chapter 12 have also been revised. 
Examples of changes in part I include: the expansion of rule 1.4F8 to cover serials and inte-
grating resources as well as mUltipart items; and, changes to rules in chapters 2 and 9 to 
reflect the coverage of integrating resources in chapter 12. Examples of changes in part II 
include: the revision of rule 21.2A and its division into two subrules to cover major and 
minor changes in titles proper; the revision of rules 21.2C and 21.3B and their division into 
subrules to cover serials and integrating resources; and, the revision of rule 21.30J and its 
division into two subrules to cover added entries for titles proper and for variant titles. 
</p>
<p>New definitions were added to the glossary for: "bibliographic resource," "continuing 
resource," "integrating resource," "iteration," and "updating loose-leaf." Definitions were 
revised for: "key-title," "monograph," "multipart item," "section," and "serial." 
</p>
<p>One of the goals of the revision of chapter 12 was the harmonization of AACR with the 
International Standard Bibliographic Description for Serials (ISBD(S&raquo; (to be published as 
ISBD(CR&raquo; and ISSN guidelines, both of which were also being revised. A number of 
changes were made to align the three standards, including: the revision of rule 12.1B2, 
requiring the choice of the full form as the title proper when both an initialismlacronym 
appear on the chief source of information; and, the revision of rule 21.2 to reflect the three-
way agreement on what constitutes major/minor title changes. In addition, agreement was 
reached on definitions in the glossary. 
</p>
<p>AMENDMENTS 2001 
</p>
<p>Rule 0.24 
</p>
<p>xviii 
</p>
<p>Rule 0.24 was reworded to stress the importance of bringing out all the aspects of the item 
being described. This revision is considered to be a first step in moving forward on "content 
vs. carrier" issues. 
</p>
<p>General material designation for cartographic materials 
</p>
<p>The general material designations "globe" and "map" in list 2 in rule 1.1Cl have been 
replaced with the single general material designation "cartographic material."

<p>SUMMARY OF RULE REVISIONS 
</p>
<p>Chapter 9 (Electronic Resources) and other related rules 
</p>
<p>The revisions to chapter 9, now called "Electronic Resources," fall into two categories: 
</p>
<p>&bull; changes to align with the International Standard Bibliographic Description for Elec-
tronic Resources (lSBD(ER&raquo;; 
</p>
<p>&bull; changes to accommodate the particular nature of electronic resources. 
</p>
<p>Changes falling into the first category include: the clarification of the scope of chapter 9 and 
the provision of a distinction between direct access and remote access electronic resources; 
the addition of an instruction at new rule 9.4B2 to consider all remote access electronic 
resources as published; and, changing the name of the file characteristics area (9.3) to "Type 
and extent of resource area." 
</p>
<p>Changes in the second category include: the changing of the chief source of information 
from the title screen to the resource itself and the removal of the preference given to internal 
sources; the addition of an option at rule 9 .5B 1 to allow for the use of conventional terminol-
ogy to describe a physical carrier, e.g., "1 CD-ROM" instead of "1 computer optical disc"; 
and, the addition of rule 9.7B22 (Item described) to instruct the cataloguer to always give the 
date viewed when describing remote access electronic resources. In addition, more current 
examples of electronic resources have been included and the glossary has been updated with 
new and revised definitions. 
</p>
<p>The general material designation in list 1 and list 2 of rule 1.ICI has been changed from 
"computer file" to "electronic resource." 
</p>
<p>Works that report the collective activity of a conference, etc. 
</p>
<p>The provision that a conference, expedition or event must be prominently named has been 
removed from rule 21.IB2(d). The concept of "prominence" is not used in any other cate-
gory of rule 21.IB2. 
</p>
<p>British terms of honour 
</p>
<p>Rule 22.I2B, which prescribed the inclusion of British terms of honour in headings for which 
surnames are the entry element, has been deleted. The requirement for terms of address to 
precede the forename had proved to be an obstacle to MARC format alignment and record 
exchange between the libraries and bibliographic agencies using AACR. In addition, the 
terms had small value for identification in such headings and even less for filing purposes. 
</p>
<p>Where required to distinguish between identical names, terms of honour may still be added 
under the rule at 22.I9B 1. 
</p>
<p>Terms of address of married women 
</p>
<p>Because of filing problems associated with the placement of the term of address of married 
women (e.g., Mrs.) before the husband's forename, rule 22.I5BI has been revised so that the 
term of address follows the husband's forename. 
</p>
<p>Subordinate conference headings 
</p>
<p>Rule 24.7AI was expanded to make it explicit that information indicating the number, fre-
quency, or year(s) of convocation of a conference should also be omitted from headings for 
subordinate conferences.

<p>"Work" in music uniform titles 
</p>
<p>Changes have been made in chapter 25 to clarify the use of the term "work" in the rules for 
music uniform titles, including moving the definition in the glossary for "musical work" to a 
footnote to rule 25.25A. 
</p>
<p>Appendix B.S. Other Parts of the Catalogue Entry 
</p>
<p>Rule B.5 was changed to allow for the replacement of one form of abbreviation with the pre-
scribed abbreviation in the edition statement and with numbering in the series statement. Pre-
viously only full forms of terms could be abbreviated. 
</p>
<p>Appendix E. Initial Articles 
</p>
<p>The new appendix contains a list of initial articles from languages most frequently encoun-
tered by cataloguers, and is intended to assist in the application of the rules that call for the 
omission of initial articles.

<p>Numbering grammatically integrated with series title

<p>Rule 1.6B 1 was expanded to include instructions for cases where numbering is an integral 
part of the title proper of the series. 
</p>
<p>Chronological designation in series numbering 
</p>
<p>Rule 1.6G3 was changed to indicate that a chronological designation may be given after a 
numeric and/or alphabetic designation. Rule 1.6Al and the corresponding rules in other chap-
ters were expanded to include an instruction to enclose a date following a numeric and/or 
alphabetic designation in parentheses. 
</p>
<p>Subseries 
</p>
<p>Additions were made to rule 1.6H to cover more subseries situations. Rule 1.6Al and the 
corresponding rules in other chapters were expanded to include instructions for the punctua-
tion preceding the designation for a subseries. 
</p>
<p>Numbering 
</p>
<p>A definition for "Numbering" was added to the glossary.

<p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>0.1. These rules are designed for use in the construction of catalogues and other lists in gen-
erallibraries of all sizes. They are not specifically intended for specialist and archivallibrar-
ies, but such libraries are recommended to use the rules as the basis of their cataloguing and 
to augment their provisions as necessary. The rules cover the description of, and the provi-
sion of access points for, all library materials commonly collected at the present time. The 
integrated structure of the text makes the general rules usable as a basis for cataloguing 
uncommonly collected materials of all kinds and library materials yet unknown. 
</p>
<p>0.2. The second edition of the rules is based on a reconciliation of the British and North 
American texts of the 1967 edition. This extends to style, which is generally in accordance 
with the Chicago Manual of Style, 1 and to spellings, which are those of Webster's New Inter-
national Dictionary.2 Where Webster's gives as a permitted alternative a British spelling 
(e.g., catalogue, centre), it has been used in the rules; where the American usage is the only 
one specified (e.g., capitalize), it has been used in the rules. Agreement on terminology has 
similarly resulted sometimes in the use of an American term (e.g., membership in) and some-
times in a British term (e.g., full stop). 
</p>
<p>STRUCTURE OF THE RULES 
</p>
<p>0.3. The rules follow the sequence of cataloguers' operations in most present-day libraries 
and bibliographic agencies. Part I deals with the provision of information describing the item 
being catalogued and part II deals with the determination and establishment of headings 
(access points) under which the descriptive information is to be presented to catalogue users, 
and with the making of references to those headings. The introductions to parts I and II begin 
on Part 1-1 and Part II-I respectively. 
</p>
<p>0.4. In both parts the rules proceed from the general to the specific. In part I the specificity 
relates to the physical medium of the item being catalogued, to the level of detail required for 
each element of the description, and to the analysis of an item containing separate parts.

<p>0.5 GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>MAIN ENTRY AND ALTERNATIVE HEADINGS 
</p>
<p>0.5. In part II the rules are based on the proposition that one main entry is made for each 
item described, and that this is supplemented by added entries. The question of the use of 
alternative heading entries (i.e., sets of equal entries for each item described) was discussed 
but not embodied in the rules. It is recognized, however, that many libraries do not distin-
guish between the main entry and other entries. It is recommended that such libraries use 
chapter 21 as guidance in determining all the entries required in particular instances. It will 
be necessary, however, for all libraries to distinguish the main entry from the others when: 
</p>
<p>a) making a single entry listing 
or b) making a single citation for a work (as required for entries for related works and 
</p>
<p>for some subject entries). 
</p>
<p>In addition, the concept of main entry is considered to be useful in assigning uniform titles 
and in promoting the standardization of bibliographic citation. 
</p>
<p>STRUCTURE OF ENTRIES 
</p>
<p>0.6. Distinguish a name heading and/or uniform title assigned to a description from the 
descriptive data: 
</p>
<p>either a) by giving them on separate lines above the description 
or b) by separating them from the description by a full stop and two spaces. 
</p>
<p>If an entry begins with a title proper (i.e., the first element of the description): 
</p>
<p>either a) repeat the title proper on a separate line above the description 
or b) give the description alone. 
</p>
<p>ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS 
</p>
<p>2 
</p>
<p>0.7. Some rules are designated as alternative rules or as optional additions, and some other 
rules or parts of rules are introduced by optionally. These provisions arise from the recogni-
tion that different solutions to a problem and differing levels of detail and specificity are 
appropriate in different contexts. Decide some alternatives and options as a matter of cata-
loguing policy for a particular catalogue or bibliographic agency and, therefore, exercise them 
either always or never. Exercise other alternatives and options case by case. All cataloguing 
agencies should distinguish between these two types of option and keep a record of their pol-
icy decisions and of the circumstances in which a particular option may be applied. 
</p>
<p>0.8. The word prominently (used in such phrases as prominently named and stated promi-
nently) means that a statement to which it applies must be a formal statement found in one of 
the prescribed sources ?f information (see l.OA) for areas I and 2 for the class of material to 
which the item being catalogued belongs. 
</p>
<p>0.9. These rules recognize the necessity for judgement and interpretation by the cataloguer. 
Such judgement and interpretation may be based on the requirements of a particular catalogue 
or upon the use of the items being catalogued. The need for judgement is indicated in these 
rules by words and phrases such as if appropriate, important, and if necessary. Such words ~ 
and phrases indicate recognition of the fact that uniform legislation for all types and sizes of

</p>
<p>catalogue is neither possible nor desirable, and encourage the application of individual judge-
ment based on specific local knowledge. This statement in no way contradicts the value of 
standardization. Apply such judgements consistently within a particular context and record 
the cataloguing agency's policy. 
</p>
<p>APPENDICES 
</p>
<p>STYLE 
</p>
<p>0.10. Matters of general application (abbreviations, capitalization, the treatment of numerals, 
and initial articles) are dealt with in appendices. The instructions given in those appendices 
are rules and must be applied consistently. A glossary is also included. 
</p>
<p>0.11. In matters of style not covered by the rules and appendices (e.g., matters of punctuation 
other than prescribed punctuation), follow the Chicago Manual of Style. 
</p>
<p>LANGUAGE PREFERENCES 
</p>
<p>0.12. The rules contain some instances in which a decision is made on the basis of language 
and in which English is preferred. Users of the rules who do not use English as their working 
language should replace the specified preference for English by a preference for their working 
language. Authorized translations will do the same. 
</p>
<p>0.13. The ALNLC romanization tables3 are used in examples in which romanization occurs. 
This usage is based on the recognition that these tables are used by the overwhelming major-
ity of libraries in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Authorized 
translations will, in examples, substitute romanizations derived from the standard romaniza-
tion tables prevailing in libraries in the countries or areas for which the translation is 
intended. 
</p>
<p>EXAMPLES 
</p>
<p>0.14. The examples used throughout these rules are illustrative and not prescriptive. That is, 
they illuminate the provisions of the rule to which they are attached, rather than extend those 
provisions. Do not take the examples or the form in which they are presented as instructions 
unless specifically told to do so by the accompanying text. 
</p>
<p>Examples often have explanatory notes in italics added to them. Do not confuse them with 
notes to be added to the description by the cataloguer (see l.7). In part I of the rules, a note 
to be added to the description is indicated in the examples by Note. Do not add this word to 
the actual description. . 
</p>
<p>Two marks of omission are used in examples. One indicates that the mark is to form a part 
of the actual catalogue entry. Its appearance is shown in the next line:

<p>DESCRIPTION </p>

<div class="page"><p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>0.21. This part of the rules contains instructions on the formulation of descriptions of library 
materials. Those descriptions need (in most instances) headings and/or uniform titles added to 
them before they are usable as catalogue entries. For instructions on the formulation of such 
access points, see part II. 
</p>
<p>0.22. The rules for description are based on the general framework for the description of 
library materials, the General International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD(G)l) 
agreed between the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) 
and the Joint Steering Committee for Revision of AACR. They follow that framework 
exactly in the order of elements and their prescribed punctuation. It was agreed with IFLA 
that it is not necessary for codes of rules to follow the terminology of the ISBD(G) exactly. 
</p>
<p>IFLA has developed, and is developing, specialized ISBDs for specific types of material, 
also on the basis of the ISBD(G). Close correspondence will therefore exist between chapters 
in part I and the corresponding ISBD. 
</p>
<p>STRUCTURE OF PART I 
</p>
<p>0.23. The basic rules for the description of all library materials are to be found in chapter 1, 
which sets out all the rules that are of general applicability. Then follow rules for specific 
types of material (chapters 2-10) and rules of partial generality (chapters 11-13). There are 
no chapters numbered 14-20; part II begins with chapter 21, the paragraphs of the Introduc-
tion to part II being numbered 20.1, 20.2, etc. 
</p>
<p>Chapter 1 is a general chapter containing those rules that apply to all library materials. For 
example, rule lAC deals with the place of publication, distribution, etc., and subsequent 
chapters in part I refer the user to that rule for guidance on that topic. Where types of mate-
rial demand specific treatment of a certain element, the general chapter contains only brief 
guidance and the user of the rules will find specific guidance in the appropriate specific chap-
ter. For example, rule 1.5 contains an indication of the type of information found in the 
physical description area; and detailed guidance on the physical description of sound record-
ings will be found in rule 6.5, on the physical description of motion pictures and videorecord-
ings in rule 7.5, and so on. Use the chapters in part I alone or in combination as the specific 
problem demands. For example, a difficult problem in describing a serial sound recording 
might lead the user to consult chapters 1,6, and 12. The majority of problems, however, can 
be solved, once the rules have been studied comprehensively, by a single reference to a single 
rule.

<p>0.24 INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>Within the chapters the rule numbering has a mnemonic structure. For example, rule l.4C 
is concerned with the place of publication, etc., for all materials, rule 2.4C is concerned with 
the place of publication, etc., for printed monographs, rule 3.4C is concerned with the place 
of publication, etc., for cartographic materials, and so on. If a particular rule appearing in 
chapter 1 is not applicable to the material treated in a subsequent chapter, the rule is omitted 
from that chapter. For example, there is no rule numbered 5.7B17 because rule 1.7B17 is not 
applicable to music. 
</p>
<p>METHODSOFPROCEDURE 
</p>
<p>0.24. It is important to bring out all aspects of the item being described, including its content, 
its carrier, its type of publication, its bibliographic relationships, and whether it is published 
or unpublished. In any given area of the description, all relevant aspects should be described. 
As a rule of thumb, the cataloguer should follow the more specific rules applying to the item 
being catalogued, whenever they differ from the general rules. 
</p>
<p>0.25. The ISBD(G) contains an area for details that are special to a particular class of mate-
rial or type of pUblication. This third area is used in these rules for cartographic materials 
(chapter 3), music (chapter 5), electronic resources (chapter 9), continuing resources (chapter 
12), and, in some circumstances, microforms (chapter 11). Do not use this area for any other 
materials treated in these rules. Where it is applicable and appropriate, repeat this area. For 
example, in describing a serial cartographic item or a serial electronic resource, give details 
relating to the cartographic material or the electronic resource and those relating to its serial-
ity (in that order). 
</p>
<p>OPTIONS AND OMISSIONS 
</p>
<p>Part I-2 
</p>
<p>0.26. Although the rules for description are based upon a standard (the ISBD(G)), it is recog-
nized that certain materials do not require every element of that standard. For this reason 
there are differences between the treatment of some materials and some others. For example, 
the extent of item element is called "number of volumes and/or pagination" in the chapter on 
books, pamphlets, and printed sheets (chapter 2). Again, the place of publication, etc., and the 
name of publisher, etc., elements are not used for manuscripts, some art originals, and some 
three-dimensional objects and artefacts. 
</p>
<p>0.27. All notes described in the chapters of part I are optional (unless a note is specifically 
stated to be mandatory) in that their inclusion in the entry depends on the nature of the item 
described and the purpose of the entry concerned. In addition, the wording of notes in the 
examples is not prescriptive (i.e., if desired, choose another wording provided that it meets 
the general requirements of brevity and clarity). 
</p>
<p>0.28. Not all measurements prescribed in part I for library materials are metric. They are the 
normal measurements used at this time in libraries in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States. Where no predominant system of measurement exists, metric measure-
ments have been used. Substitute metric measurements for nonmetric measurements when: 
</p>
<p>either a) in the course of time a metric measurement becomes the normal measurement for 
the materials in question 
</p>
<p>or b) the rules are being used in a country where only metric measurements are used. 
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>INTRODUCTION 0.29 
</p>
<p>0.29. Rule l.OD contains a specification of three levels of description. Consider each of these 
levels as a minimum. When appropriate, add further information to the required set of data. 
The three levels of description allow libraries flexibility in their cataloguing policy, because 
they prescribe an entry that is in conformity with bibliographic standards and yet allow some 
materials to be described in more detail than others. Use the three levels of description: 
</p>
<p>either a) by choosing a level of description for all items catalogued in the library 
or b) by drawing up guidelines for the use of all three levels in one catalogue depend-
</p>
<p>ing on the type of item being described. 
</p>
<p>This standardization at three levels of description will help in achieving uniformity of cata-
loguing, and it is recommended that each machine-readable record carry an indication of the

<p>GENERAL RULES FOR DESCRIPTION 1.0CI 
</p>
<p>1.10 ITEMS MADE UP OF SEVERAL TYPES OF MATERIAL 
</p>
<p>1.11 FACSIMILES, PHOTOCOPIES, AND OTHER REPRODUCTIONS 
</p>
<p>1.0. GENERAL RULES 
</p>
<p>I.OA. Sources of information 
</p>
<p>I.OAt. Each chapter in part I contains a specification of the chief source of information for 
each material or type of publication covered by that chapter. A source of information may be 
unitary in nature (e.g., a title page) or may be collective (e.g., the credits sequence of a 
motion picture). Prefer information found in that chief source to information found elsewhere. 
When the other sources of information are placed in a ranking order by specific chapters, 
follow that order. For each area of the description one or more sources of information are 
prescribed. Enclose in square brackets information taken from outside the prescribed 
source(s). 
</p>
<p>I.OA2. Items lacking a chief source of information. If no part of the item supplies data that 
can be used as the basis of the description, take the necessary information from any available 
source, whether this be a reference work or the content of the item itself. This technique may 
be necessary for printed works, the title pages of which are lost; collections of pamphlets or 
other minor material assembled by the library or by a previous owner and that are to be cata-
logued as a single item; nonprocessed sound recordings, etc. In all such cases give in a note 
the reason for and/or source of the supplied data. 
</p>
<p>I.OB. Organization of the description 
</p>
<p>I.OBI. The description is divided into the following areas: 
</p>
<p>Title and statement of responsibility 
Edition 
Material (or type of publication) specific details 
Publication, distribution, etc. 
Physical description 
Series 
Note 
Standard number and terms of availability 
</p>
<p>Each of these areas is divided into a number of elements as set out in the rules in this and in 
following chapters. 
</p>
<p>I.OC. Punctuation 
</p>
<p>I.OCI. Precede each area, other than the first area, or each occurrence of a note or standard 
number, etc., area, by a full stop, space, dash, space (. - ) unless the area begins a new 
paragraph. 
</p>
<p>Precede or enclose each occurrence of an element of an area with standard punctuation 
prescribed at the head of each section of this chapter.

</p>
<p>GENERAL RULES FOR DESCRIPTION 
</p>
<p>Precede each mark of prescribed punctuation by a space and follow it by a space, except 
for the comma, full stop, hyphen (see 12.3A2), and opening and closing parentheses and 
square brackets. The comma, full stop, hyphen, and closing parenthesis and square bracket 
are not preceded by a space; the hyphen and the opening parenthesis and square bracket are 
not followed by a space. 
</p>
<p>Precede the first element of each area, other than the first element of the first area or the 
first element of an area beginning a new paragraph, by a full stop, space, dash, space. When 
that element is not present in a description, precede the first element that is present by a full 
stop, space, dash, space instead of the prescribed preceding punctuation for that element. 
</p>
<p>Indicate an interpolation (i.e., data taken from outside the prescribed source(s) of informa-
tion) by enclosing it in square brackets. Indicate a conjectural interpolation by adding a ques-
tion mark within the square brackets. Indicate the omission of part of an element by the mark 
of omission ( ... ). Precede and follow the mark of omission by a space. Omit any area or 
element that does not apply in describing an individual item; also omit its prescribed preced-
ing or enclosing punctuation. Do not indicate the omission of an area or element by the mark 
of omission. 
</p>
<p>When adjacent elements within one area are to be enclosed in square brackets, enclose 
them in one set of square brackets unless one of the elements is a general material designa-
tion, which is always enclosed in its own set of square brackets.

<p>When adjacent elements are in different areas, enclose each element in a set of square 
brackets. 
</p>
<p>[2nd ed.]. - [London] : Thomsons, 1973 
</p>
<p>When an element ends with an abbreviation followed by a full stop or ends with the mark 
of omission and the punctuation following that element either is or begins with a full stop, 
omit the full stop that constitutes or begins the prescribed punctuation.

</p>
<p>When punctuation occurring within or at the end of an element is retained, give it with 
normal spacing. Prescribed punctuation is always added, even though double punctuation 
may result.

<p>1.0D. Levels of detail in the description 
</p>
<p>The elements of description provided in the rules in this and in following chapters consti-
tute a maximum set of infonnation. This rule sets out three recommended levels of descrip-
tion each containing those elements that must be given as a minimum by libraries and other 
cataloguing agencies choosing that level of description. Base the choice of a level of descrip-
tion on the purpose of the catalogue or catalogues for which the entry is constructed. Include 
this minimum set of elements for all items catalogued at the chosen level when the elements 
are applicable to the item being described and when, in the case of optional additions, the 
library has chosen to include an optional element. If the rules in part I specify other pieces of

</p>
<p>1.0F. Inaccuracies 
</p>
<p>1.0Fl. In an area where transcription from the item is required, transcribe an inaccuracy or a 
misspelled word as it appears in the item. Follow such an inaccuracy either by [sic] or by i.e. 
and the correction within square brackets. Supply a missing letter or letters in square brack-
ets. For inaccuracies in the title proper of a serial or an integrating resource, see 12.1B 1.

</p>
<p>1.0Gl. Add accents and other diacritical marks that are not present in the data found in the 
source of information in accordance with the usage of the language used in the context. 
</p>
<p>1.0H. Items with several chief sources of iuformation 
</p>
<p>1.0Hl. Single part items. Describe an item in one physical part from the first occurring chief 
source of information or the one that is designated as first, unless one of the following 
applies. 
</p>
<p>a) In cataloguing an item comprising different works and with no chief source of informa-
tion pertaining to the whole item, treat the sources of information for the different 
works as if they were a single source. Common examples include books containing a 
number of works with title pages for each (see lo1G3) and sound discs with a different 
label on each side (see 6.0Bl). 
</p>
<p>b) Prefer a chief source of information bearing a later date of publication, distribution, etc. 
c) If the chief sources present the item in different aspects (e.g., as an individual item and 
</p>
<p>as part of a multipart item), prefer the source that corresponds to the aspect in which 
the item is to be treated. 
</p>
<p>d) For items that contain written, spoken, or sung words for which there are chief sources 
of information in more than one language or script, prefer (in this order): 
</p>
<p>i) the source in the language or script of the written, spoken, or sung words if there is 
only one such language or script or only one predominant language or script 
</p>
<p>ii) the source in the original language or script of the work if the words are in more 
than one language or script, unless translation is known to be the purpose of the 
publication, in which case use the source in the language of the translation 
</p>
<p>iii) the source in the language or script that occurs first in the following list: English, 
French, German, Spanish, Latin, any other language using the roman alphabet, 
Greek, Russian, any other language using the cyrillic alphabet, Hebrew, any other 
language using the Hebrew alphabet, any other language. 
</p>
<p>1.0H2. Multipart items. Describe an item in several physical parts from the chief source of 
information for the first part. If the first part is not available, use the first part that is. If there 
is no discernible first part, use the part that gives the most information. Failing this, use any

<p>1.1G2 GENERAL RULES FOR DESCRIPTION 
</p>
<p>1.lG2. If, in an item lacking a collective title, no one work predominates, either describe the 
item as a unit (see 1.1G3) or make a separate description for each separately titled work, 
linking the separate descriptions with notes (see 1.7B21). 
</p>
<p>1.lG3. If describing the item as a unit, transcribe the titles of the individually titled works in 
the order in which they appear in the chief source of information or, if there is no single chief 
source of information, in the order in which they appear in the item, treating multiple sources 
of information as if they were one source (see 1.0H). 
</p>
<p>Separate the titles of the works by semicolons if the works are all by the same person(s) or 
emanate from the same body (bodies), even if the titles are linked by a connecting word or 
phrase. Follow the title of each work by its parallel title(s) and other title information.

statement(s) of responsibility. Separate the groups of data with a full stop followed by two 
spaces.

<p>2.0. GENERAL RULES 
</p>
<p>2.0A. Scope 
</p>
<p>BOOKS, PAMPHLETS, AND PRINTED SHEETS 2.0B2 
</p>
<p>2.0Al. The rules in this chapter cover the description of separately published monographic 
printed items other than cartographic items (see chapter 3) and printed music (see chapter 5). 
These are referred to hereafter in this chapter as printed monographs and comprise books, 
pamphlets, and single sheets. For microform reproductions of printed texts, see chapter 11. 
For serials and updating loose-leafs, see also chapter 12. 
</p>
<p>2.0B. Sources of information 
</p>
<p>2.0Bl. Chief source of information. The chief source of information for printed monographs 
is the title page or, if there is no title page, the source from within the publication that is used 
as a substitute for it. For printed monographs published without a title page, or without a title 
page applying to the whole work (as in the case of some editions of the Bible and some 
bilingual dictionaries), use the part of the item supplying the most complete information, 
whether this be the cover (excluding a separate book jacket), caption, colophon, running title, 
or other part. Specify the part used as a title page substitute in a note (see 2.7B3). If no part 
of the item supplies data that can be used as the basis of the description, take the necessary 
information from any available source. If the information traditionally given on the title page 
is given on facing pages or on pages on successive leaves, with or without repetition, treat 
those pages as the title page. 
</p>
<p>Use the colophon as the chief source of information for an oriental nonroman script publi-
cation if the colophon contains full bibliographic information and the following conditions 
apply: 
</p>
<p>a) the page standing in the position of a title page bears only the title proper 
or b) the title page bears only a calligraphic version of the title proper 
or c) the title page bears only a western-language version of the title and other biblio-
</p>
<p>graphic information. 
</p>
<p>2.0B2. Prescribed sources of information. The prescribed source(s) of information for each 
area of the description of printed monographs is set out below. Enclose information taken 
from outside the prescribed source(s) in square brackets.

</p>
<p>2.SB4. If the number printed on the last page or leaf of a sequence does not represent the 
total number of pages or leaves in that sequence, let it stand uncorrected unless it gives a 
completely false impression of the extent of the item, as, for instance, when only alternate 
pages are numbered or when the number on the last page or leaf of the sequence is mis-
printed. Supply corrections in such cases in square brackets.

<p>2.12. SCOPE 
</p>
<p>2.12A. The following rules (2.13-2.18) are extra rules for the description of early books, 
pamphlets, and broadsides (for the most part, pre-nineteenth-century pUblications). In general, 
follow the instructions in chapter 1 and in 2.1-2.11 for describing those materials and use the 
additional and modifying rules given below only when the conditions they state apply to the 
early book, etc., or when, as in 2.16, they contain instructions different from the previous 
rules. Consult specialized reference materials for more detailed treatment of early printed 
books, etc. 
</p>
<p>2.13. CHIEF SOURCE OF INFORMATION 
</p>
<p>2.13A. If the early book, etc., has a title page, use it as the chief source of information. If it 
has no title page, use the following sources (in this order of preference): 
</p>
<p>caption 
colophon 
cover 
running title 
incipit or explicit 
privilege or imprimatur 
other sources 
</p>
<p>If the item has no title page, make a note indicating the source used (see 2.18B). 
</p>
<p>2.14. TITLE AND STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY AREA 
</p>
<p>2.14A. If the item has no title page and if no other source furnishes a title proper, transcribe 
as the title proper as many of the opening words of the text as are sufficient to identify the 
item uniquely. 
</p>
<p>2.14B. In abridging a long title proper (see 1.1B4), omit first any alternative title and the 
connecting word (e.g., or), then omit inessential words or groups of words. Indicate 
omissions by the mark of omission. 
</p>

are separate from the title proper.

prepositional phrase, etc., as other title information, not as part of the title proper.

</p>
<p>2.14E. Transcription of certain letters 
</p>

the text. If the usage of the text is in doubt or if it is inconsistent, transcribe

J as i 
U as u (but as v when it is the first letter of the word) 
V as u (but as v when it is the first letter of the word) 
VV as uu (but as vv when it is the first letter of the word) 
</p>
<p>Transcribe gothic capitals in the form of J and U as I and V. 
</p>
<p>2.14F. Abridge lengthy other title information and statements of responsibility by omitting 
inessential words or groups of words. Include as many words of a statement of responsibility 
as are necessary to identify the person(s) concerned.

<p>3.0. GENERAL RULES 
</p>
<p>3.0A. Scope 
</p>
<p>3.0B3 
</p>
<p>3.0Al. The rules in this chapter cover the description of cartographic materials of all kinds. 
Cartographic materials include all materials that represent the whole or part of the earth or 
any celestial body. These include two- and three-dimensional maps and plans (including maps 
of imaginary places); aeronautical, nautical, and celestial charts; atlases; globes; block dia-
grams; sections; aerial photographs with a cartographic purpose; bird's-eye views (map 
views); etc. They do not cover in detail the description of early or manuscript cartographic 
materials, though the use of an additional term in the physical description (see 3.5B) and/or 
the use of the specific instructions in chapter 4 will furnish a sufficiently detailed description 
for the general library catalogue. For items falling within the scope of other chapters but pre-
senting cartographic information (e.g., some wall charts, some playing cards), consult the 
rules in this chapter in conjunction with those of the chapter appropriate to the item. 
</p>
<p>3.0B. Sources of information 
</p>
<p>3.0Bl. For sources of information for a printed atlas, see 2.0B. 
</p>
<p>3.0B2. Chief source of information. The chief source of information for other than a printed 
atlas (in order of preference) is: 
</p>
<p>a) the cartographic item itself; when an item is in a number of physical parts, treat all the 
parts (including a title sheet) as the cartographic item itself 
</p>
<p>b) container (e.g., portfolio, cover, envelope) or case, the cradle and stand of a globe, etc. 
</p>
<p>If information is not available from the chief source, take it from any accompanying 
printed material (e.g., pamphlets, brochures). 
</p>
<p>3.0B3. Prescribed sources of information. The prescribed source(s) of information for each 
area of the description of cartographic materials is set out below. Enclose information taken 
from outside the prescribed source(s) in square brackets.

script music, see also chapter 5. 
</p>
<p>4.0B. Sources of information 
</p>
<p>4.0Bl. Chief source of information. The chief source of information for manuscripts is the 
manuscript itself. Within manuscripts, use (in this order of preference) information from the: 
</p>
<p>title page 
colophon 
caption, heading, etc. 
content of the manuscript 
</p>
<p>However, prefer a source that is part of the original manuscript to sources that have been 
supplied later. If information is not available from the chief source, take it from the following 
sources (in this order of preference): 
</p>
<p>another manuscript copy of the item 
a published edition of the item 
reference sources 
other sources 
</p>
<p>For collections of manuscripts, treat the whole collection as the chief source.

manuscript or other unpublished music in detail, though the use of an additional term in the 
physical description (see 5.5B) and the use of the specific provisions of chapter 4 will furnish 
a sufficiently detailed description for the general library catalogue. For the description of 
recorded music, see chapter 6. For microform reproductions of music, see chapter 11.

<p>SOUND RECORDINGS 6.0B2 
</p>
<p>6.0. GENERAL RULES 
</p>
<p>6.0A. Scope 
</p>
<p>6.0Al. The rules in this chapter cover the description of sound recordings in all media, i.e., 
discs, tapes (open reel-to-reel, cartridges, cassettes), piano rolls (and other rolls), and sound 
recordings on film (other than those intended to accompany visual images, for which see 
chapter 7). They do not cover specifically recordings in other forms (e.g., wires, cylinders) or 
in various experimental media, though the use of appropriate specifications in the physical 
description (see 6.5) and special notes will furnish a sufficiently detailed description for such 
items. 
</p>
<p>6.0B. Sources of information 
</p>
<p>6.0Bl. Chief source of information. The chief source of information for each major type of 
sound recording is set out here. 
</p>
<p>TYPE 
</p>
<p>Disc 
Tape (open reel-to-reel) 
Tape cassette 
Tape cartridge 
Roll 
Sound recording on film 
</p>
<p>CHIEF SOURCE 
</p>
<p>Disc and label! 
Reel and label 
Cassette and label 
Cartridge and label 
Label 
Container and label 
</p>
<p>If there are two or more chief sources of information as defined above (e.g., two labels on 
a disc), treat these as a single chief source. 
</p>
<p>Treat accompanying textual material or a container as the chief source of information if it 
furnishes a collective title and the parts themselves and their labels do not. In this case, make 
a note (see 6.7B3) indicating the source of information. 
</p>
<p>If information is not available from the chief source, take it from the following sources (in 
this order of preference): 
</p>
<p>accompanying textual material 
container (e.g., sleeve, box) 
other sources 
</p>
<p>Prefer textual data to sound data. For example, if a sound disc has a label and also infor-
mation presented in sound form on the disc, prefer the label information. 
</p>
<p>6.0B2. Prescribed sources of information. The prescribed source(s) of information for each 
area of the description of sound recordings is set out below. Enclose information taken from 
outside the prescribed source(s) in square brackets. 
</p>
<p>1. Label means any permanently affixed paper, plastic, etc., label as opposed to the container itself, which may have data 
embossed or printed on it.

sones) or body (bodies) named in a statement found in the chief source of information goes 
beyond that of performance, execution, or interpretation of a work (as is commonly the case 
with "popular," rock, and jazz music), give such a statement as a statement of responsibility.

<p>GRAPHIC MATERIALS 8.0C 
</p>
<p>8.0. GENERAL RULES 
</p>
<p>8.0A. Scope 
</p>
<p>8.0Al. The rules in this chapter cover the description of graphic materials of all kinds, 
whether opaque (e.g., two-dimensional art originals and reproductions, charts, photographs, 
technical drawings) or intended to be projected or viewed (e.g., filmstrips, radiographs, 
slides), and collections of such graphic materials. For unpublished graphic materials, see also 
the instructions in chapter 4. For visual material recorded on film and intended to be pro-
jected so as to create the illusion of movement, see chapter 7. For microforms, see chapter 
11. For maps, etc., see chapter 3. For microscope slides, see chapter 10. 
</p>
<p>8.0B. Sources of information 
</p>
<p>8.0Bl. Chief source of information. The chief source of information for graphic materials is 
the item itself including any labels, etc., that are permanently affixed to the item or a con-
tainer that is an integral part of the item. If the item being described consists of two or more 
separate physical parts (e.g., a slide set), treat a container that is the unifying element as the 
chief source of information if it furnishes a collective title and the items themselves and their 
labels do not. In this case, make a note (see 8.7B3) indicating the source of information. If 
information is not available from the chief source, take it from the following sources (in this 
order of preference): 
</p>
<p>container (e.g., box, frame) 
accompanying textual material (e.g., manuals, leaflets) 
other sources 
</p>
<p>In describing a collection of graphic materials as a unit, treat the whole collection as the 
chief source. 
</p>
<p>8.0B2. Prescribed sources of information. The prescribed source(s) of information for each 
area of the description of graphic materials is set out below. Enclose information taken from 
outside the prescribed source(s) in square brackets.

</p>
<p>9.0Al. The rules in this chapter cover the description of electronic resources. Electronic 
resources consist of data (information representing numbers, text, graphics, images, maps, 
moving images, music, sounds, etc.), programs (instructions, etc., that process the data for 
use), or combinations of data and programs. Electronic resources often include components 
with characteristics found in multiple classes of materials so there will frequently be a need

<p>ELECTRONIC RESOURCES 9.0B2 
</p>
<p>to consult other chapters. For example, in describing a serially-issued cartographic electronic 
resource, use chapters 3, 9, and 12. 
</p>
<p>For cataloguing purposes, electronic resources may be treated in one of two ways depend-
ing on whether access is direct (local) or remote (networked). Direct access is understood to 
mean that a physical carrier can be described. Such a carrier (e.g., disc/disk, cassette, car-
tridge) must be inserted into a computerized device or into a peripheral attached to a comput-
erized device. Remote access is understood to mean that no physical carrier can be handled. 
Remote access can only be provided by use of an input-output device (e.g., a terminal), either 
connected to a computer system (e.g., a resource in a network), or by use of resources stored 
in a hard disk or other storage device. 
</p>
<p>9.OB. Sources of information 
</p>
<p>9.OBl. Chief source of information. The chief source of information for electronic resources 
is the resource itself. 
</p>
<p>Take the information from formally presented evidence (e.g., title screen(s), main menus, 
program statements, initial display(s) of information, home page(s), the file header(s) includ-
ing "Subject:" lines, encoded metadata (e.g., TEl headers, HTMLIXML meta tags), and the 
physical carrier or its labels l ), including information that has been uncompressed, printed out, 
or otherwise processed for use. If the information in these sources varies in degree of full-
ness, prefer the source that provides the most complete information. 
</p>
<p>If the information required is not available from the resource itself, take it from the follow-
ing sources (in this order of preference): 
</p>
<p>printed or online documentation or other accompanying material 
(e.g., publisher's letter, "about" file, publisher's Web page 
about an electronic resource) 
</p>
<p>information printed on a container issued by the publisher, 
distributor, etc. 
</p>
<p>If the item being described consists of two or more separate physical parts, treat a con-
tainer or its permanently affixed label that is the unifying element as the chief source of infor-
mation if it furnishes a collective title and the formally presented information in, or the labels 
on, the parts themselves do not. 
</p>
<p>If the information required is not available from the chief source or the sources listed 
above, take it from the following sources (in this order of preference): 
</p>
<p>other published descriptions of the resource 
other sources (e.g., metadata records) 
</p>
<p>9.OB2. Prescribed sources of information. The prescribed source(s) of information for each 
area of the description of electronic resources is set out below. Enclose information taken 
from outside the prescribed source(s) in square brackets. 
</p>
<p>1. Label refers to any paper, plastic, etc., label permanently affixed to a physical carrier, or information printed or 
embossed directly onto the physical carrier by the publisher, creator, etc., of the resource, as opposed to those on the 
container or to any label added locally.

</p>
<p>Give the source of the edition statement in a note (see 9.7B7) if it is different from the 
source of the title proper. 
</p>
<p>9.2B2. In case of doubt about whether a statement is an edition statement, take the presence 
of words such as edition, issue, version, release, level, update (or their equivalents in other 
languages) as evidence that the statement is an edition statement, and transcribe it as such. 
</p>
<p>9.2B3. Optional addition. If an electronic resource lacks an edition statement but is known to 
contain significant changes from other editions (e.g., changes in the data involving content, 
standardized coding, etc.; changes in the programming including changes in the program 
statements, programming language, and programming routines and operations; the addition of 
sound or graphics; improvement of graphics), supply a suitable brief statement in the lan-
guage and script of the title proper and enclose it in square brackets. 
</p>
<p>[Version 7, Rev. version] 
</p>
<p>[Windows 95 ed.] 
</p>
<p>9.2B4. Do not treat an issue of a resource that incorporates minor changes as a new edition. 
Such minor changes include corrections of misspellings of data, changes in the arrangement 
of the contents, changes in the output format or the display medium, and changes in the 
physical characteristics (e.g., blocking factors, recording density). If desired, give the details 
of such changes in a note (see 9.7B7). 
</p>
<p>9.2BS. If an item consists of multiple physical carriers, including accompanying material, and 
there are multiple edition statements relating to the whole as well as to parts of the resource, 
transcribe only the edition statement(s) relating to the whole resource in the edition area. Edi-
tion statements relating to parts may be given in a note (see 9.7B7). 
</p>
<p>9.2B6. If an edition statement appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the 
statement that is in the language or script of the title proper. If this criterion does not apply, 
transcribe the statement that appears first. Optionally, transcribe the parallel statement(s), 
each preceded by an equals sign. 
</p>
<p>9.2B7. If an item lacking a collective title and described as a unit contains one or more works 
with an associated edition statement, transcribe such statements following the titles and state-
ments of responsibility to which they relate, separated from them by a full stop. 
</p>
<p>9.2C. Statements of responsibility relating to the edition 
</p>
<p>9.2Cl. Transcribe a statement of responsibility relating to one or more editions, but not to all 
editions, of a resource as instructed in 1.2C and 9.1F. If desired, transcribe other statements 
of responsibility relating to the edition in a note (see 9.7B7).

<p>may be reproductions of existing textual or graphic materials or they may be original 
publications. 
</p>
<p>1l.OB. Sources of information 
</p>
<p>1l.OBl. Chief source of information. The chief source of information for microfilms is the 
title frame (i.e., a frame, usually at the beginning of the item, bearing the full title and, nor-
mally, publication details of the item). The chief source of information for aperture cards is, 
in the case of a set of cards, the title card, or, in the case of a single card, the card itself. The 
chief source of information for microfiches and micro opaques is the title frame. If there is no 
such information or if the information is insufficient, treat the eye-readable data printed at the 
top of the fiche or opaque as the chief source of information. If, however, the title appears in 
a shortened form on the "header" and appears in a fuller form on the accompanying eye-
readable materials or the container, treat the accompanying eye-readable materials or the con-
tainer as the chief source of information and make a note (see 11.7B3) giving the source of 
the title proper. If information normally presented on the title frame or title card is presented 
on successive frames or cards, treat these frames or cards as the chief source of information. 
</p>
<p>If information is not available from the chief source, take it from the following sources (in 
this order of preference): 
</p>
<p>the rest of the item (including a container that is an integral part 
of the item) 
</p>
<p>container 
accompanying eye-readable material 
any other source 
</p>
<p>1l.OB2. Prescribed sources of information. The prescribed source(s) of information for 
each area of the description of microforms is set out below. Enclose information taken from 
outside the prescribed source(s) in square brackets.

</p>
<p>12.0A. Scope 
</p>
<p>12.0Bl 
</p>
<p>12.0A1. The rules in this chapter cover the description of continuing resources, whether suc-
cessively issued (i.e., serials) or integrating (e.g., updating loose-leafs, updating Web sites). 
These rules also cover the description of the following categories of finite resources (i.e., 
those with a predetermined conclusion): resources that exhibit characteristics of serials, such 
as successive issues, numbering, and frequency, but whose duration is limited (e.g., newslet-
ters of events); reprints of serials; and finite integrating resources. The rules in this chapter do 
not apply to the description of multipart items. 
</p>
<p>These rules focus on the continuing nature of serials and integrating resources and are 
applied in conjunction with rules in other chapters of part I. For example, in describing an 
electronic journal, consult chapter 9 for rules specifically applying to the electronic aspects of 
the journal and chapter 12 for the continuing aspects. 
</p>
<p>If a rule does not apply to all continuing resources, the scope of that rule is indicated. 
See chapter 21 for guidelines to determine if a change on subsequent issues or parts of a 
</p>
<p>serial or on subsequent iterations of an integrating resource requires a new description. If a 
new description is not made, see the rules regarding changes in this chapter (e.g., 12.1B8, 
12.1D3, 12.1E2) for instructions.

<p>a) Printed resources. The chief source of information is the title pagel or the title page 
substitute. The title page substitute for an item lacking a title page is (in this order of 
preference) the analytical title page, cover, caption, masthead, editorial pages, colo-
phon, other pages. Specify the source used as the title page substitute in a note (see 
12.7B3). If information traditionally given on the title page is given on facing pages, 
with or without repetition, treat the two pages as the title page. 
</p>
<p>Use the colophon as the chief source of information for an oriental nonroman script 
resource if the colophon contains full bibliographic information and the following con-
ditions apply: 
</p>
<p>i) the page standing in the position of a title page bears only the title proper 
or ii) the title page bears only a calligraphic version of the title proper 
or iii) the title page bears only a western-language version of the title and other biblio-
</p>
<p>graphic information. 
</p>
<p>b) Nonprint resources. For direct access electronic serials, prefer the physical carrier or 
its labels as the chief source of information. For other nonprint resources, follow the 
instructions in subrule .OB in the relevant chapter for the resource in question in deter-
mining the chief source of information. For example, to determine the chief source of 
information for a serial sound recording, see 6.0Bl.

<p>13.6 MULTILEVEL DESCRIPTION 
</p>
<p>13.1. SCOPE 
</p>
<p>13.lA. Analysis is the process of preparing a bibliographic record that describes a part or 
parts of an item for which a comprehensive entry might be made. The rules in this chapter 
offer various ways of achieving analysis. Some of these methods of analysis are related to 
provisions found in other chapters, but all the methods are collected here with general guide-
lines to assist in the selection of one of the means of analysis. Cataloguing agencies have 
their own policies affecting analysis; in particular, a policy predetermining the creation of 
separate bibliographic records may override any other consideration. 
</p>
<p>Although the rules in this chapter are stated as instructions, apply them according to the 
policy of the cataloguing agency. 
</p>
<p>13.2. ANALYTICAL ADDED ENTRIES 
</p>
<p>13.2A. If, in a comprehensive entry for a larger work, a part is named either in the title and 
statement of responsibility area or in the note area, make an added entry for that part. The 
heading for the added entry consists of the main entry heading (which may include or consist 
of a uniform title) or title proper of the part (see 21.30M). This method is appropriate when 
direct access to the part is wanted without creating an additional bibliographic record for the 
part.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.3 ANALYSIS 
</p>
<p>13.3. ANALYSIS OF MONOGRAPHIC SERIES AND MULTIPART MONOGRAPHS 
</p>
<p>13.3A. If the item is a part of a monographic series or a multipart monograph and has a title 
not dependent on that of the comprehensive item, prepare an analytical entry consisting of a 
complete bibliographic description of the part. Give details of the comprehensive item in the 
series area (see 1.6).

England; v. 15). - Bibliography: p. 602-639 
</p>
<p>13.4. NOTE AREA 
</p>
<p>13.4A. In making a comprehensive entry for a larger work, list the parts in a contents note. 
This technique is the simplest means of analysis; the bibliographic description of the part is 
usually limited to a citation of title or name and title.

</p>
<p>13.5. "IN" ANALYTICS 
</p>
<p>13-2 
</p>
<p>13.SA. If more bibliographic description is needed for the part than can be obtained by dis-
playing it in the note area, make an "In" analytic entry. 
</p>
<p>The descriptive part of an "In" analytic entry consists of a description of the part analyzed 
followed by a short citation of the whole item in which the part occurs. 
</p>
<p>Make a description of the part analyzed consisting of those of the following elements that 
apply to the part: 
</p>
<p>title proper, other title information, statement(s) of responsibility 
edition 
numbering (in the case of a serial) 
publication, distribution, etc., details 
extent and specific material designation (when appropriate, in 
</p>
<p>terms of its physical position within the whole item)

dimensions 
notes 
</p>
<p>Begin the citation of the whole item with In (italicized, underlined, or otherwise empha-
sized). Follow In by: 
</p>
<p>name and/or uniform title heading (see part II) of the whole item, 
if appropriate

<p>13.6. MULTILEVEL DESCRIPTION 
</p>
<p>13-4 
</p>
<p>13.6A. Multilevel description is normally used by national bibliographies and those catalogu-
ing agencies that prepare entries needing complete identification of both part and comprehen-
sive whole in a single record that shows as its primary element the description of the whole. 
Use it as an alternative to "In" analytic entries. 
</p>
<p>Divide the descriptive information into two or more levels. Give at the first level only 
information relating to the item as a whole. Give at the second level information relating to a 
group of parts or to the individual part being described. If information at the second level 
relates to a group of parts, give information relating to the individual part at a third level. 
Make the levels distinct by layout and/or other means.

<p>INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>20.1. When a standard description for an item has been established according to the rules in 
part I, add headings and/or uniform titles to that description to create catalogue entries. The 
only exception is when an entry is made under title proper, in which case the entry may be 
made under the first words of the description. In this connection, see also 0.6. 
</p>
<p>The rules in part II deal with the choice of access points for main and added entries (chap-
ter 21), with the form of name headings and uniform titles (chapters 22-25), and with refer-
ences (chapter 26). In each chapter, general rules precede special rules. Where no specific 
rule exists for a specific problem, apply the more general rule(s). 
</p>
<p>The rules in part II apply to works and not to physical manifestations of those works, 
though the characteristics of an individual item are taken into account in some instances. 
</p>
<p>The rules in part II apply to all library materials. 
</p>
<p>20.2. Chapter 23 deals with geographic names. Though often used as part of corporate head-
ings, these names pose a separate problem. Distinguish between the problem of establishing 
geographic names in a standard form and the related but separate problem of establishing 
corporate headings involving such names. 
</p>
<p>20.3. In chapters 22, 23, and 24, there are rules for additions to names used as headings (see 
22.17-22.19,23.4, and 24.4C). Always make such additions in cases of need to distinguish 
otherwise identical names in a catalogue, and in other cases called for by the rules. In addi-
tion, for the optional rules in chapter 22, optionally add these elements to all headings, in 
anticipation of future conflicts. In automated catalogues, such optional additions will always 
be recorded in the machine-readable record, but they need not necessarily form part of head-
ings in printed entries derived from those records. 
</p>
<p>EXAMPLES 
</p>
<p>20.4. As with the examples in part I, those in part II are illustrative and not prescriptive. 
Moreover, they illustrate only the solutions to the problems dealt with in the rule to which 
they are appended. Other added entries (in chapter 21) or references (in chapters 22-25) may 
be necessary in the actual instances cited. 
</p>
<p>When an example prescribes main (or added) entry under title, interpret title as meaning 
title proper or uniform title as appropriate in the particular case. When a rule or example 
prescribes a name-title added entry, make an additional added entry under the title concerned, 
if appropriate. 
</p>
<p>The presentation of the examples (their layout and typography) is only intended to help in 
the use of the rules. Do not take it as implying a prescribed layout or typography for head-
ings and uniform titles.

<p>20.4 INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>In chapters 22-25, x is used to indicate the necessity for a see reference and xx the neces-
sity for a see also reference. 
</p>
<p>The elements of bibliographic description included in the examples in this part (principally 
in chapters 21 and 25) are set out according to the provisions of part I. These never constitute 
a complete description. The elements shown are only those that bear on the choice and/or 
form of the access point(s).

<p>21.0. INTRODUCTORY RULES 
</p>
<p>21.0A. Main and added entries 
</p>
<p>21.0Al. The rules in this chapter are rules for determining the choice of access points (head-
ings) under which a bibliographic description (see part I) is entered in a catalogue. The rules 
give instructions on the choice of one of these access points as the main entry heading, the 
others being added entry headings. In general, each rule only gives instructions on those 
access points that are explicitly covered by the rule. Certain general points (e.g., series entries 
and title added entries) are dealt with in the rules on added entries (see 21.29-21.30). 
</p>
<p>21.0B. Sources for determining access points 
</p>
<p>21.0Bl. Determine the access points for the item being catalogued from the chief source of 
information (see LOA) for the item or any part of the item that is being used as its substitute. 
Take other statements prominently stated in the item into account (see 0.8). Use information 
appearing only in the content of an item (e.g., the text of a book; the sound content of a

<p>sound recording) or appearing outside the item only when the statements appearing in the 
chief source of information are ambiguous or insufficient. 
</p>
<p>21.0C. Form of examples 
</p>
<p>21.0Cl. The access points to be made are indicated without showing their forms. Determine 
the forms of these access points as instructed in chapters 22-25. When an example is fol-
lowed by Main (or Added) entry under title, use the title proper or, when appropriate, the 
uniform title (see chapter 25). 
</p>
<p>Title added entries are indicated only when the rule involves consideration of the title as a 
possible main entry heading. See 21.30J for general rules on making title added entries. 
</p>
<p>21.0D. Optional addition. Designations of function 
</p>
<p>21.0Dl. In the cases noted below, add an abbreviated designation of function to an added 
entry heading for a person. 
</p>

</p>
<p>DESIGNATION

</p>
<p>Add other designations to headings as instructed in particular rules. 
In specialist or archival cataloguing, when desirable for identification or file arrangement, 
</p>
<p>add designations from standard lists appropriate to the material being catalogued. 
</p>
<p>21.1. GENERAL RULE 
</p>
<p>21-6 
</p>
<p>21.1A. Works of personal authorship 
</p>
<p>21.1Al. Definition. A personal author is the person chiefly responsible for the creation of the 
intellectual or artistic content of a work. For particular applications of this definition, see sub-
sequent rules in this chapter. For persons who function solely as performers on sound record-
ings, see 21.23. 
</p>
<p>21.1A2. General rule. Enter a work by one or more persons under the heading for the per-
sonal author (see 21.4A), the principal personal author (see 21.6B), or the probable personal 
author (see 21.5B). In some cases of shared personal authorship (see 21.6) and mixed per-
sonal authorship (see 21.8-21.27), enter under the heading for the person named first. Make 
added entries as instructed in 21.29-21.30. 
</p>
<p>21.1B. Entry under corporate body 
</p>
<p>21.1Bl. Definition. A corporate body is an organization or a group of persons that is identi-
fied by a particular name and that acts, or may act, as an entity. Consider a corporate body to 
have a name if the words referring to it are a specific appellation rather than a general 
description. Consider a body to have a name if, in a script and language using capital letters 
for proper names, the initial letters of the words referring to it are consistently capitalized, 
and/or if, in a language using articles, the words are always associated with a definite article. 
Typical examples of corporate bodies are associations, institutions, business firms, nonprofit 
</p>
<p>AACR2 Revision 2002 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CHOICE OF ACCESS POINTS 21.1B2 
</p>
<p>enterprises, governments, government agencies, projects and programmes, religious bodies, 
local church groups identified by the name of the church, and conferences'! 
</p>
<p>Some corporate bodies are subordinate to other bodies (e.g., the Peabody Museum of Nat-
ural History is subordinate to Yale University; the Annual General Meeting is subordinate to 
the Canadian Library Association). 
</p>
<p>Consider ad hoc events (such as athletic contests, exhibitions, expeditions, fairs, and festi-
vals) and vessels (e.g., ships and spacecraft) to be corporate bodies. 
</p>
<p>21.1B2. General rule. Enter a work emanating2 from one or more corporate bodies under the 
heading for the appropriate corporate body (see 21.4B, 21.5B) if it falls into one or more of 
the following categories: 
</p>
<p>a) those of an administrative nature dealing with the corporate body itself 
or its internal policies, procedures, finances, and/or operations 
or its officers, staff, and/or membership (e.g., directories) 
or its resources (e.g., catalogues, inventories) 
</p>
<p>b) some legal, governmental, and religious works of the following types:3 
</p>
<p>laws (see 21.31) 
decrees of the chief executive that have the force of law (see 21.31) 
administrative regulations (see 21.32) 
constitutions (see 21.33) 
court rules (see 21.34) 
treaties, etc. (see 21.35) 
court decisions (see 21.36) 
legislative hearings 
religious laws (e.g., canon law) 
liturgical works (see 21.39) 
</p>
<p>c) those that record the collective thought of the body (e.g., reports of commissions, com-
mittees, etc.; official statements of position on external policies) 
</p>
<p>d) those that report the collective activity of a conference (e.g., proceedings, collected 
papers), of an expedition (e.g., results of exploration, investigation), or of an event 
(e.g., an exhibition, fair, festival) falling within the definition of a corporate body (see 
21.1Bl), provided that the conference, expedition, or event is named in the item being 
catalogued 
</p>
<p>e) those that result from the collective activity of a performing group as a whole where the 
responsibility of the group goes beyond that of mere performance, execution, etc. Publi-
cations resulting from such activity include sound recordings, films, videorecordings, and 
written records of performances. (For corporate bodies that function solely as performers 
on sound recordings, see 21.23.) 
</p>
<p>f) cartographic materials emanating from a corporate body other than a body that is 
merely responsible for their publication or distribution. 
</p>
<p>1. Conferences are meetings of individuals or representatives of various bodies for the purpose of discussing and/or acting 
on topics of common interest, or meetings of representatives of a corporate body that constitute its legislative or governing 
body. 
</p>
<p>2. Consider a work to emanate from a corporate body if it is issued by that body or has been caused to be issued by that 
body or if it originated with that body. 
</p>
<p>3. Some legal and governmental works are entered under headings for bodies other than the body from which they emanate. 
</p>
<p>AACR2 Revision 2002 21-7 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.1B3 CHOICE OF ACCESS POINTS 
</p>
<p>In case of doubt about whether a work falls into one or more of these categories, treat it as 
if it does not. 
</p>
<p>In some cases of shared responsibility (see 21.6) and mixed responsibility (see 21.8-
21.27), enter such a work under the heading for the corporate body named first. Make added 
entries as instructed in 21.29-21.30. 
</p>
<p>21.1B3. If a work emanates from one or more corporate bodies and falls outside the catego-
ries given in 21.1B2, treat it as if no corporate body were involved. Make added entries under 
the headings for prominently named corporate bodies as instructed in 21.30E. 
</p>
<p>21.1C. Entry under title 
</p>
<p>21.1Cl. Enter a work under its title proper or, when appropriate, uniform title (see chapter 
25) if: 
</p>
<p>a) the personal authorship is unknown (see 21.5) or diffuse (see 21.6C2), and the 
work does not emanate from a corporate body 
</p>
<p>or b) it is a collection of works by different persons or bodies (see 21.7) 
or c) it emanates from a corporate body but does not fall into any of the categories 
</p>
<p>given in 21.1B2 and is not of personal authorship 
or d) it is accepted as sacred scripture by a religious group (see 21.37). 
</p>
<p>Make added entries as instructed in 21.29-21.30. 
</p>
<p>21.2. CHANGES IN TITLES PROPER 
</p>
<p>21-8 
</p>
<p>21.2A. Definition 
</p>
<p>21.2Al. Major changes. In general, for all bibliographic resources except integrating 
resources, consider as a major change in a title proper the addition, deletion, change, or reor-
dering of any of the first five words (the first six words if the title begins with an article) 
unless the change belongs to one or more of the categories listed in 21.2A2. 
</p>
<p>Consider also as a major change the addition, deletion, or change of any word after the 
first five words (the first six words if the title begins with an article) that changes the meaning 
of the title or indicates a different subject matter. 
</p>
<p>Also consider as a major change in title proper a change in a corporate body name given 
anywhere in the title if it is a different corporate body. 
</p>
<p>21.2A2. Minor changes. In general, consider the following to be a minor change in a title 
proper: 
</p>
<p>a) a difference in the representation of a word or words anywhere in the title (e.g., one 
spelling vs. another; abbreviated word or sign or symbol vs. spelled-out form; arabic 
numeral(s) vs. roman numeral(s); numbers or dates vs. spelled-out form; hyphenated 
words vs. unhyphenated words; one-word compounds vs. two-word compounds, 
whether hyphenated or not; an acronym or initialism vs. full form; or a change in gram-
matical form (e.g., singular vs. plural&raquo; 
</p>
<p>b) the addition, deletion, or change of articles, prepositions, or conjunctions anywhere in 
the title 
</p>
<p>AACR2 Revision 2002 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CHOICE OF ACCESS POINTS 21.2Cl 
</p>
<p>c) a difference involving the name of the same corporate body and elements of its hierar-
chy or their grammatical connection anywhere in the title (e.g., the addition, deletion, 
or rearrangement of the name of the same corporate body or the substitution of a vari-
ant form) 
</p>
<p>d) the addition, deletion, or change of punctuation, including initialisms and letters with 
separating punctuation vs. those without separating punctuation, anywhere in the title 
</p>
<p>e) a different order of titles when the title is given in more than one language in the chief 
source of information, provided that the title chosen as title proper still appears as a 
parallel title 
</p>
<p>f) the addition, deletion, or change of words anywhere in the title that link the title to the 
numbering 
</p>
<p>g) two or more titles proper used on different issues of a serial according to a regular 
pattern 
</p>
<p>h) the addition to, deletion from, or change in the order of words in a list anywhere in the 
title, provided that there is no significant change in the subject matter 
</p>
<p>i) the addition or deletion anywhere in the title of words that indicate the type of resource 
such as "magazine," "journal," or "newsletter" or their equivalent in other languages. 
</p>
<p>In case of doubt, consider the change to be a minor change. 
As appropriate, give, in the note area (see 1.7B4), those changes not considered to consti-
</p>
<p>tute a major change in the title proper. 
</p>
<p>21.2B. Monographs 
</p>
<p>21.2B1. Monographs in one physical part. If the title proper of a monograph in one physi-
cal part changes between one edition and another, make a separate main entry for each edi-
tion. Follow the instructions in 25.1 in deciding whether to use uniform titles to assemble all 
the editions. 
</p>
<p>21.2B2. Monographs in more than one physical part. If the title proper of a monograph in 
more than one physical part changes between parts, give the title proper of the first part as the 
title of the whole monograph. If, however, another title proper appearing on later parts pre-
dominates, change the title proper of the whole monograph to the later title proper. If the title 
proper of a multipart monograph changes between editions, follow the instructions in 21.2Bl. 
</p>
<p>21.2C. Serials and integrating resources 
</p>
<p>21.2C1. 
</p>
<p>a) Serials. If a major change occurs in the title proper of a serial, make a new entry. 
</p>
<p>b) Integrating resources. If a change occurs in the title proper of the same integrating 
resource, do not make a new entry. Instead, replace the title proper with the new title 
and change the description to reflect the latest information. In general, give the earlier 
title in a note (see 12.7B4.2).

in 21.9-21.23. 
</p>
<p>21.3A2. If there is a change in responsibility between the parts of a multipart monograph, 
enter the monograph under the heading appropriate to the first part. If, however, a different 
person or corporate body responsible for later parts predominates, change the heading to that

even if the title proper remains the same: 
</p>
<p>i) if the heading for a corporate body under which a serial is entered changes 
or ii) if the main entry for a serial is under a personal or corporate heading and 
</p>
<p>the person or body named in that heading is no longer responsible for the 
serial 
</p>
<p>or iii) if the main entry for a serial is under a uniform title (see 25.5B) with a cor-
porate heading as a qualifier and the corporate heading changes or the body 
named in that heading is no longer responsible for the serial. 
</p>
<p>b) Integrating resources. If any of the conditions given in 21.3Bla occurs, do not make a 
new entry for the same integrating resource. Instead, change the entry to reflect the lat-
est information and give the earlier name or form of name in a note if considered to be 
important (see 12.7B7.2).

</p>
<p>21.SA. Scope 
</p>
<p>21.10A 
</p>
<p>21.SAl. A work of mixed responsibility is one to which different persons or bodies make 
intellectual or artistic contributions by performing different kinds of activity (e.g., writing, 
adapting, illustrating, editing, arranging, translating). 
</p>
<p>The rules in this section are divided into the following two types of mixed responsibility: 
</p>
<p>a) previously existing works that have been modified (e.g., translations, musical arrange-
ments, adaptations, see 21.9-21.23) 
</p>
<p>b) new works to which different persons or bodies have made different kinds of contribu-
tions (e.g., collaborative works by a writer and an artist, works reporting interviews, see 
21.24-21.27). 
</p>
<p>Works That Are Modifications of Other Works 
</p>
<p>21.9. GENERAL RULE 
</p>
<p>21.9A. Enter a work that is a modification of another under the heading appropriate to the 
new work if the modification has substantially changed the nature and content of the original 
or if the medium of expression has been changed. If, however, the modification is an abridge-
ment, rearrangement, etc., enter under the heading appropriate to the original. In some cases 
the wording of the chief source of information is taken into account; in other cases the nature 
of the work itself is the basis for the decision on entry. 
</p>
<p>For specific applications of this general rule, see 21.10-21.23. 
</p>
<p>Modifications of Texts 
</p>
<p>21.10. ADAPTATIONS OF TEXTS 
</p>
<p>21.10A. Enter a paraphrase, rewriting, adaptation for children, or version in a different liter-
ary form (e.g., novelization, dramatization) under the heading for the adapter. If the name of 
the adapter is unknown, enter under title. Make a name-title added entry for the original

</p>
<p>21.29E. Construct a heading for an added entry according to the instructions in chapters 22-
25. For instructions on the construction of name-title added entries, see 21.30G. 
</p>
<p>21.29F. If the reason for an added entry is not apparent from the description (e.g., if a person 
or body whose name is used as the basis for an added entry heading is not named in a state-
ment of responsibility or in the publication details), provide a note giving, as appropriate, the

</p>
<p>21-48 
</p>
<p>21.30A. Two or more persons or bodies involved 
</p>
<p>21.30Al. If the following subrules refer to only one person or corporate body and two or 
three persons or bodies are involved in a particular instance, make added entries under the 
headings for each. If four or more persons or bodies are involved in a particular instance, 
make an added entry when appropriate under the heading for the one named first in the 
source from which the names are taken. 
</p>
<p>21.30B. Collaborators 
</p>
<p>21.30Bl. If the main entry is under the heading for one of two or three collaborating persons 
or bodies, make added entries under the headings for the others. 
</p>
<p>If the main entry is under the heading for a corporate body or under a title, make added 
entries under the headings for collaborating persons if there are pot more than three, or under 
the heading for the first named of four or more.

</p>
<p>21.30El. Make an added entry under the heading for a prominently named corporate body, 
unless it functions solely as distributor or manufacturer. Make an added entry under a promi-
nently named publisher if the responsibility for the work extends beyond that of merely pub-
lishing the item being catalogued. In case of doubt, make an added entry.

<p>CHOICE OF ACCESS POINTS 21.30Jl 
</p>
<p>21.30F. Other related persons or bodies 
</p>
<p>21.30Fl. Make an added entry under the heading for a person or corporate body having a 
relationship to a work not treated in 21.1-21.28 if the heading provides an important access 
point (e.g., the addressee of a collection of letters; a person honoured by a Festschrift; a 
museum in which an exhibition is held). 
</p>
<p>21.30G. Related works 
</p>
<p>21.30Gl. Make an added entry under the heading for a work to which the work being cata-
logued is closely related (see 21.8-21.28 for guidance in specific cases). 
</p>
<p>In such a case, the heading is that of the person or corporate body or the title under which 
the related work is, or would be, entered. If that heading is for a person or body, and the title 
of the related work differs from that of the work being catalogued, add the title of the related 
work to the heading to form a name-title added entry heading. When necessary, add the edi-
tion statement, date, etc., to the name-title or title added entry heading. 
</p>
<p>When appropriate, substitute a uniform title (see chapter 25) for a title proper in a name-
title or title added entry heading for a related work. 
</p>
<p>21.30H. Other relationships 
</p>
<p>21.30Hl. Make an added entry under the heading for any other name that would provide an 
important access point unless the relationship between the name and the work is purely that 
of a subject. For example, make added entries under the heading for the name of a collection 
from which reproductions of art works have been taken or under the heading for a collection 
of books upon which a bibliography is based. 
</p>
<p>When possible, formulate headings for such names by analogy with corporate name 
headings. 
</p>
<p>21.30J. Titles 
</p>
<p>21.30JI. Title proper. Make an added entry under the title proper of every item entered 
under a personal heading, a corporate heading, or a uniform title unless: 
</p>
<p>a) the title proper is essentially the same as the main entry heading or a reference to 
that heading 
</p>
<p>or b) the title proper has been composed by the cataloguer 
or c) in a catalogue in which name-title and subject entries are interfiled, the title proper 
</p>
<p>is identical to a subject heading assigned to the work or a direct reference to that 
subject heading 
</p>
<p>or d) a conventionalized uniform title has been used as the uniform title for a musical 
work (see 25.25-25.35). 
</p>
<p>If considered necessary for access, make an added entry in the following situations: 
</p>
<p>a) for any change in the title proper of a serial that is not a major change (see 
21.2A2) 
</p>
<p>b) for the title proper of an earlier iteration of an integrating resource (see 21.2C) 
c) for the earlierllater title proper of a multipart item (see 21.2B2).

<p>22.2A1. If a person (other than one using a pseudonym or pseudonyms, see 22.2B) is known 
by more than one name, choose the name by which the person is clearly most commonly 
known, if there is one. Otherwise, choose one name or form of name according to the follow-
ing order of preference: 
</p>
<p>a) the name that appears most frequently in the person's works 
b) the name that appears most frequently in reference sources 
c) the latest name. 
</p>
<p>22.2B. Pseudonyms 
</p>
<p>22.2B1. One pseudonym. If all the works by one person appear under one pseudonym,

choose, as the basis for the heading for each group of works, the name by which works in 
that group are identified. Make references to connect the names (see 26.2C and 26.2D). In 
case of doubt, do not consider a person to have separate bibliographic identities (for contem-
porary authors see also 22.2B3).

</p>
<p>In case of doubt as to which of two or more languages written in the Arabic script should 
be used for the romanization, base the choice on the nationality of the person or the language 
of the area of residence or activity. If these criteria do not apply, choose (in this order of 
preference): Urdu, Arabic, Persian, any other language. 
</p>
<p>22.3D. Spelling 
</p>
<p>22.3D1. If variant spellings of a person's name are found and these variations are not the 
result of different romanizations, choose the form resulting from an official change in orthog-
raphy, or, if this does not apply, choose the predominant spelling. In case of doubt, choose 
the spelling found in the first item catalogued. For spelling differences resulting from differ-
ent romanizations, see 22.3C. 
</p>
<p>Entry Element 
</p>
<p>22.4. GENERAL RULE 
</p>
<p>22.4A. If a person's name (chosen according to 22.1-22.3) consists of several parts, select as 
the entry element that part of the name under which the person would normally be listed in 
authoritative alphabetic lists5 in his or her language or country of residence or activity. In 
applying this general rule, follow the instructions in 22.5-22.9. If, however, a person's prefer-
ence is known to be different from the normal usage, follow that preference in selecting the 
entry element. 
</p>
<p>22.4B. Order of elements 
</p>
<p>22.4B1. If the entry element is the first element of the name, enter the name in direct order. 
</p>
<p>Ram Gopal

<p>Special Rules for Names in Certain Languages 
</p>
<p>22.21. INTRODUCTORY RULE 
</p>
<p>22.21A. The preceding rules in this chapter give general guidance for personal names not 
written in the roman alphabet and for names in a non-European language written in the 
roman alphabet. For more detailed treatment of names in certain of these languages, follow 
the special rules given below. For more detailed treatment of names in other languages, see 
the IFLA UBCIM Programme's survey of personal names.17

</p>
<p>22.22. NAMES IN THE ARABIC ALPHABET18 
</p>
<p>22.22A. Scope 
</p>
<p>22.22Al. Apply this rule only to names (regardless of their origin) originally written in the 
Arabic alphabet that do not contain a surname or a name performing the function of a sur-
name. In case of doubt, assume that a name of a person active in the twentieth century 
includes a surname (see 22.5) and that other names do not. 
</p>
<p>22.22B. Entry element 
</p>
<p>22.22Bl. Enter a name made up of a number of elements under the element or combination 
of elements by which the person is best known. Determine this from reference sources. When 
there is insufficient evidence available, enter under the first element. Refer from any part of 
the name not used as entry element if there is reason to believe that the person's name may 
be sought under that part. Refer as necessary from variant romanizations (see 22.3C). 
</p>
<p>22.22C. Essential elements 
</p>
<p>22.22Cl. If the entry element is not the given name (ism) or a patronymic derived from the 
name of the father (a name usually following the given name and compounded with ibn), 
include these names unless they are not customarily used in the name by which the person is 
known. Include an additional name, descriptive epithet, or term of honour that is treated as 
part of the name if it aids in identifying the individual. Generally omit other elements of the 
name, particularly patronymics derived from anyone other than the father. 
</p>

in these sources differ):

<p>24.2B. If variant fonns6 of the name are found in items issued by the body, use the name as it 
appears in the chief sources of infonnation (see l.OA) as opposed to fonns found elsewhere 
in the items. 
</p>
<p>24.2C. If variant spellings of the name appear in items issued by the body, use the form 
resulting from an official change in orthography or, if this does not apply, use the predomi-
nant spelling. In case of doubt, use the spelling found in the first item catalogued. 
</p>
<p>24.2D. If variant names appear in the chief source of infonnation, use the name that is pre-
sented formally. If no name is presented formally, or if all names are presented formally, use 
the predominant fonn of name.

<p>25.1. USE OF UNIFORM TITLES 
</p>
<p>2S.1A. Uniform titles can be used for different purposes. They provide the means: 
</p>
<p>for bringing together all catalogue entries for a work1 when 
various manifestations (e.g., editions, translations) of it have 
appeared under various titles; 
</p>
<p>for identifying a work when the title by which it is known differs 
from the title proper of the item being catalogued; 
</p>
<p>for differentiating between two or more works published under 
. identical titles proper; 
</p>
<p>for organizing the file. 
</p>
<p>The need to use uniform titles varies from one catalogue to another and varies within one 
catalogue. Base the decision whether to use a uniform title in a particular instance on one or 
more of the following, as appropriate: 
</p>
<p>1) how well the work is known 
2) how many manifestations of the work are involved 
3) whether another work with the same title proper has been identified (see 25.5B) 
4) whether the main entry is under title (see 21.1C) 
5) whether the work was originally in another language 
6) the extent to which the catalogue is used for research purposes. 
</p>
<p>Although the rules in this chapter are stated as instructions, apply them according to the 
policy of the cataloguing agency. 
</p>
<p>25.2. GENERAL RULE 
</p>
<p>2S.2A. Formulate a uniform title for a work as instructed in the rules that follow. Enclose the 
uniform title in square brackets. If the work is entered under title, give the uniform title as the 
</p>
<p>1. Unless otherwise indicated, work as used in this chapter includes collections and compilations catalogued as a unit.

</p>
<p>2S.2B. Do not use a uniform title for a manifestation of a work in the same language that is a 
revision or updating of the original work. Relate editions not connected by uniform titles by 
giving the title of the earlier edition in a note in the entry for the later edition (see 1.7B7, 
2.7B7, etc.) and by making an added entry as appropriate (see 21.30G).

</p>
<p>2S.2C. Initial articles 
</p>
<p>2S.2Cl. Omit an initial article (see Initial Articles, appendix E) unless the uniform title is to 
file under that article (e.g., a title that begins with the name of a person or place). 
</p>
<p>2S.2D. Romanization 
</p>
<p>2S.2Dl. If the title selected as the uniform title is in a language written in a nonroman script, 
romanize it according to the table for that language adopted by the cataloguing agency. 
</p>
<p>2S.2E. Added entries and references 
</p>
<p>2S.2El. Works entered under title. If a work is entered under a uniform title, make an 
added entry under the title proper of the item being catalogued unless the title proper is 
</p>
<p>2. In examples in this chapter uniform titles for works entered under title are shown as bold headings without square 
brackets.

a personal or corporate heading and a uniform title is used, make name-title reference(s) from 
the heading and the variant(s) of the title. Make an added entry under the title proper of the 
item being catalogued (see 21.3OJ). 
</p>
<p>Individual Titles

<p>25.3. WORKS CREATED AFTER 1500

Magnificat, mass, movement, muziek, nocturne, requiem, Stiick, symphony, suite, Te Deum, trio sonata). Other titles (including 
those that consist of such terms plus an additional word or words, e.g., chamber concerto, Konzertstiick, little suite) are 
considered to be distinctive.

<p>A.12 CAPITALIZATION 
</p>
<p>English Language 
</p>
<p>A.12. GENERAL RULE 
</p>
<p>A.12A. The rules for English-language capitalization basically follow those of the Chicago Manual of 
Style. Certain rules that differ have been modified to conform to the requirements of bibliographic 
records and long-standing cataloguing practice. 
</p>
<p>A.12B. Where a rule prescribes the capitalization of the name of a person, corporate body, or place, or 
of a title of nobility, term of honour, appellation, epithet, etc., understand this to mean that each sepa-
rate word or initial is to be capitalized excepting articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. However, in a 
place name, capitalize an article that forms an accepted part of the name according to gazetteers. 
</p>
<p>A.12C. Capitalize a plural generic term when it precedes the distinctive nouns in two or more proper 
names. Do not capitalize the generic term when it follows the nouns.

</p>

</p>
<p>A.13BI. If a name includes a prefix from a language other than English (e.g., de, des, la, I', della, 
von, von der), follow the usage of the person with regard to capitalization of the prefix. In case of 
doubt, capitalize it.

<p>INDEX 
</p>
<p>The index covers the rules (including introductions to the rules) and appendices, but not exam-
ples under the rules or works cited in any of the rules or appendices. "App. D" indicates that a 
term is defined in Appendix D (Glossary). 
</p>
<p>Rules for description have been indexed only to the general chapter (chapter 1) unless there 
is an amplification, amendment, or examples specific to a particular format in a later chapter. 
</p>
<p>The index is alphabetized word-by-word, with numerals preceding letters. Numbers, sym-
bols, and punctuation marks at the beginning of index entries are filed as if spelled out. They 
are also filed at the beginning of the alphabet, before the A's. Hyphens and other punctuation 
are ignored in filing. Thus "author-title" is filed as if spelled "authortitle." Words within paren-
theses are also disregarded in alphabetizing. 
</p>
<p>Since the locators are arranged hierarchically, index entry terms with shorter (higher) loca-
tors can be assumed to include all the subrules under it. For example, "Physical description 
area, 1.5" covers the range of rules from 1.5A to 1.5E.
