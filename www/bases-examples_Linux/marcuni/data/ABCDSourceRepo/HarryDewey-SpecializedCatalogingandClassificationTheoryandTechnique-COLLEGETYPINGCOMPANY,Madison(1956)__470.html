<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>This volume ia the result of the need for a post-elementary-level
treatise on cataloging theory. The immediate need has been for my
three- hour graduate course in cataloging at the University of Wisconsin
Library School. This course meets forty- eight times in one semester,
and much material is covered that is not touched on in this volume or
in volume one.
</p>
<p>The sequence of the chapters has no special significance.
Chapter 35 is deliberately placed at the beginning, but the remaining
chapters are placed arbitrarily. They may be studied in any order,
except that chapters 43-45 should perhaps be read as a unit and in that
order. Chapters 47-49 have a similar, though less pronounced,
relationship.
</p>
<p>Attention should be called to the use, on examinations, of the Sears
List, as shown in Appendix 4. While most of the laboratories are
based largely on the LC List, the number of copies currently available
at the school does not permit its use on examinations, when one copy
would be required for each student.
</p>
<p>This second volume of the third preliminary edition is unchanged
from the second edition, except that Chapter 50, Punched Card
Catalogs, and all of the appendixes and laboratory assignments are
new. I hope other cataloging teachers will supply advice and comment
pertaining to the text and laboratory assignments.
</p>
<p>Material dealing with the subject approach to library materials
will be published separately.

</p>
<p>Some Basic Cataloging Principles
</p>
<p>Our present cataloging codes and practices for author, title and
subject entries appear to be governed by five basic principles. These
include two principles relating to the number of entries required for
a dictionary catalog: (1) the principle of multiple approach and eco-
nomical response, and (2) the principle of unique entry for each ap^"
proach. Three other principles serve powerfully to modify these two
(and each other) and to provide for further economy in terms of the
number of entries and cross-references required. These three prin-
ciples also dictate the physical form and make-up of the entries. In
this paper , they are called (3) the principle of specific entry, (4) the
principle of probable association, and (5) the principle of inevitable
association . All of these principles apply to either choice or form
of both author and subject entries. In addition, all of them govern,
to a greater or lesser extent, the question of whether or not title
entries should be made.
</p>
<p>The Principle of Multiple Approach and Economical Response
</p>
<p>The most basic principle employed by catalogers everywhere
recognizes that readers may, and will, ask for or look in the card
catalog for a given book in a variety of ways . 1 One reader wants
to know if the library has a particular book. Another wants to know
what books the library has by a given author. Another wishes to
choose among the available books on a certain subject or on severed
subjects. These are the basic author, title and subject approaches.
In addition, some readers may wish to know if the library has any
books illustrated by a particular artist, or any recordings made by
a particular pianist or soprano. For these and similar requests,
the cataloger may provide a variety of added entries.
</p>
<p>Recognition of the multiple approaches of readers is the feature
distinguishing the modern dictionary catalog from the purely author
catalog. The latter provides only the one most important approach
for each book cataloged. This is usually the author entry, but in
the absence of evidence of specific authorship, may be an editor,
title or other similar entry. The author catalog in card form char-
acteristically appears only as a union catalog of the holdings of more
than one library system.
</p>
<p>An essential feature of the principle of multiple approach is that
the dictionary catalog shall not provide indiscriminately for all con-
ceivable approaches. Hence the name Mmultiple approach and
</p>
<p>1 Hereafter, the term "look for 11 will be used synonymously
with "ask for" and "look in the card catalog for.' 1
</p>
<p>_ 1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35-2
</p>
<p>economical response 11 for this principle. For the cataloger to pro-
vide for every conceivable approach would be to provide analytical
entries for all the subjects treated in the various parts of the book.
Added entries for all persons connected with the production and
publication of the book, including publishers, printers, editors,
illustrators, translators, proof-readers, etc., would be called for
if the principle of multiple approach were not modified by that of
economical response. A reader may look under Macmillan for a
listing of the books in the library published by that firm, but the
cataloger feels that such a catalog entry for Macmillan books is not
the most economical way of answering this question. Or the reader
may wish to know what books the library has that were translated by
Constance Garnett. The cataloger feels that such a question is so
infrequent as not to justify the expense of making added entries for
translators. In deciding whether or not to make the latter type of
entry, the cataloger must judge the probability of frequency of such
approaches.
</p>
<p>Needless to say, definitions of the term "economical response 11
</p>
<p>vary from library to library. Whether or not certain types of added
entries, author, title, and subject analytics, etc., are to be made
depends largely on the type of clientele using the library and again
on the quantity and type of materials in the library. In small public
libraries the demand for illustrator added entries will perhaps not
justify their preparation, while in an art library the opposite might
be true. In a music library, added entries for artists performing
on phonograph records will probably be much more heavily used than
they would in, say, a recreational record collection in a college
library. Subject headings for fiction would probably be much more
useful in most public libraries than in most college libraries, al-
though most public libraries do not consider them worth the expense,
particularly in view of the existence of printed guides.
</p>
<p>The decision as to whether or not to make series added entries
depends partly on the question of economical response to this pos-
sible approach.
</p>
<p>The Principle of Unique Entry for Each Approach
</p>
<p>The term "multiple approach11 refers principally to different
basic types of approaches, i.e. author, editor, illustrator, subject,
title, etc. However, each of these types, in the case of a particular
book, may also have several different approaches. Thus, the works
of Clare (Boothe) Luce may be looked for under both Luce and Boothe,
and conceivably even under Clare . The works of the poet Goethe may
be looked up by less sophisticated readers under von Goethe. Perhaps
as many readers will look up the works of Mark Twain under Twain as
under Clemens. Some readers will look for books on pitching horse-
shoes under QUOIT$,but as many more will look under HORSESHOE
PITCHING or GAMES. Some readers will seek information about the
Department of Chemistry, Alabama Polytechnic Institute, under the
Institute's widely used nickname "Auburn. 11 Some "readers' 1 will
seek recordings of the chorus of the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35-3
</p>
<p>of New York under New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra.
</p>
<p>Since all of these approaches to the same author or subject are
not only possible but also likely, catalogers long ago realized that
the principle of multiple approach, modified by economical re-
sponses, would leave them with large files of unit cards under both
Soothe and Luce, both Goethe and von Goethe ,both Twain and Clemens,
QUOITS, PITCHING HORSEHOES, HORSESHOE PITCHING and
GAMES, both Auburn. Chemistry Dept. and Alabama Polytechnic
Institute . Dept. of Chemistry , and both Philharmonic Symphony
Orchestra of New York and New York, Philharmonic Symphony
Orchestra, with or without the subdivision (or even prefix) "Chorus. 11
That other alternative approaches to these authors and subjects are
possible is obvious.
</p>
<p>To solve this problem, catalogers adopted the principle of unique
entry for each separate and distinct approach. This principle dictates
that the books of each author shall be listed in only one place in the
catalog. It provides that the books on each separate and distinct sub-
ject shall be listed in only one place in the catalog, no matter how
many names that subject may have, e.g. home economics, home-
making, household science, domestic science, household arts,
domestic economy, etc.
</p>
<p>The principle does not prevent a book by two different authors
from being cataloged under both names. It does not prevent a book
about two different subjects from being cataloged under both subjects.
</p>
<p>Nor does the principle require that the reader know the name of
the author or subject chosen by the cataloger . The principle of unique
entry, combined with the principle of multiple approach, dictates
that cross-references must be made, from likely places that the
reader will look, to the place the cataloger has chosen for listing
the books.
</p>
<p>But which form of name shall the cataloger choose -- Luce or
Boothe, Goethe or von Goethe, Twain or Clemens, PITCHING
HORSESHOES, HORSESHOE PITCHING, QUOITS or GAMES,
Auburn or Alabama. Polytechnic Institute, Philharmonic Symphony
Orchestra of New York or New York Philharmonic Symphony Or-
chestra?
</p>
<p>To solve these problems, three other principles have been em-
ployed over the years. These three principles provide for still
further economy in terms of the number of entries and cross-
references required. This is done without sacrifice of the variety
or number of responses to readers 1 approaches, as long as these
approaches are deemed to be of reasonable frequency and as long
as the catalog is a reasonably economical place in which to provide
the answers .</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>The Principle of Specific Entry
</p>
<p>This principle is applied to both subject and author entries, al-
though it is usually thought of and described in the literature only in
connection with subject entries.
</p>
<p>In the case of the reader who looks for material on pitching horse-
shoes under GAMES the principle of specific entry dictates that he
shall find there only material dealing with all kinds of games. Material
on specific kinds of games will be found only under the names of those
games, e.g. HORSESHOE PITCHING. In this case, HORSESHOE
PITCHING is the specific heading and GAMES is general, but it must
be remembered that every general heading is specific with reference
to some still-broader heading. Thus if we are looking for material on
amusements, we find books dealing generally with various types of
amusements -- including games -- under AMUSEMENTS. But a book
dealing specifically with games is not entered under AMUSEMENTS,
but under GAMES .
</p>
<p>The principle calls for see also cross-references referring the
reader from the broader topic to the more specific, in the event that
(1) the reader looked under the broader topic when he really wanted
material on the more specific topic, or (2) the reader really wanted
the broader topic but failed to find listed there enough material to
satisfy his needs.
</p>
<p>The principle of specific entry has also been applied to author en-
tries, particularly to corporate headings, but also to personal authors
used as subject headings. In addition, the subarrangement of the cards
for a given author alphabetically by title represents an application of
this principle.
</p>
<p>The principle is applied to corporate authors in cases when an
organ or agency of a large corporate body is responsible for publica-
tion. The organ, division, branch, committee, bureau, etc.,
ultimately responsible is generally considered to be the author of
its publications. Thus, the annual report of the Children's Bureau of
the Federal government is entered as such rather than as a publica-
tion of the Social Security Administration, of which the Children's
Bureau is a part, or than as a publication of the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, of which the Social Security Adminis-
tration is a part.
</p>
<p>Use of the principle thus brings together the publications of the
Children's Bureau in a compact group for the reader interested in its
work. The reader interested in the larger departments does not have
to plough through the publications of the many subsidiary bureaus,
although he may find them at the end of the file or by means of see
also references. The form of entry for subordinate units of a larger
agency is dictated by the two principles that will be described later.
</p>
<p>The use of the subdivision --BIBLIOGRAPHY in the heading
SHAKESPEARE, WILLIAM--BIBLIOGRAPHY is another example of
the theory of specific entry in the area of author headings . Other</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35-5
</p>
<p>examples are:
</p>
<p>Alabama. Polytechnic Institute. Chemistry Dept.
Harvard University. William Hayes Fogg Art Museum.
Philadelphia. Free Library.
</p>
<p>The principle of specific entry is much more important in a large
or specialized collection than in a small or unspecialized one. For,
if the total number of cards to be gone through under a broad heading
is not great, reader inconvenience is not so serious. Indeed, the
reader looking for material on the general subject may be helped in-
stead of hindered. But the reader who looks under the specific topic
will find nothing. For this reason, the principle is vital to the success
of any dictionary catalog in any size or type of library.
</p>
<p>Thus we see that the principle of specific entry helps the cataloger
out of the dilemma of trying to provide a single entry for one topic or
author to which there are multiple approaches. The principle estab-
lishes a "level 11 of specificity at which the unique entry for the topic
or author will be established. But the principle of specific entry
does not solve the problem of synonyms --of Boothe or Luce, of
QUOITS or PITCHING HORSESHOES or HORSESHOE PITCHING,
of Goethe or von Goethe, of Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Chemistry
Department or Chemistry Department, Alabama Polytechnic Institute,
or Auburn Polytechnic Institute, Dept. of Chemistry, etc., of New
York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, Chorus, or Chorus, Phil-
harmonic Symphony Orchestra of New York, etc.
</p>
<p>To solve these problems, two more principles have been used:
(4) the principle of probable association, and (5) the principle of
inevitable association.
</p>
<p>The Principle of Probable Association
</p>
<p>Having established the level of our unique entries for a given
author or topic, how have we been able to decide on the form of entry?
The principle of probable association is embedded in all of the ALA
rules for author entry and all of the Library of Congress subject
headings. Roughly, this principle decrees that, given a choice of
form of entry, the cataloger should choose that under which the
reader will most probably look.
</p>
<p>Three important factors have modified this principle:
</p>
<p>First, the realities of cooperative and centralized cataloging in
the Library of Congress program of card sales have meant the inter-
pretation of "probability'
</p>
<p>1 in terms of the national rather than the
local (in any one library) point of view. This accounts for the fact
that LC entries for local authors, both personal and corporate, but
particularly corporate, need to be modified to conform to the "prob-
able" approach of users of the card catalog.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35-6
</p>
<p>Second, the need to catalog for tomorrow as well as for today
has meant the interpretation of "probability11 in terms of the
terminology and names of the future instead of the nicknames,
colloquialisms and fads of the day. On the whole, this has led to
a conservatism in the terminology of the catalog that has been good.
Unfortunately, we take the sound terminology for granted. In using
a modern card catalog, we are not bothered by the colloquialisms,
the forgotten pseudonyms, and the nicknames of the past. But we
have forgotten that this is because Library of Congress practice and
ALA rules kept them out of our catalog, or allowed them in only as
cross-references. Instead, we carp at the relatively small number
of blunders and misnomers that have crept into the catalog. The cri-
tics have the hindsight, and the catalogers who failed to foresee the
spread of the European War, 1914- into the World War of 1914-18
until it seemed too late to move thousands of cards have been blamed
for their lack of foresight. How many of us have stopped to think
that, if catalogers today would accept all the latest fashions in termin-
ology, the catalogs of tomorrow would be full of the out-of- style and
forgotten ?
</p>
<p>Third, agreement that rules of entry for authors and subject
headings should apply to types of names rather than to individual
names has led to a minimum number of common-sense exceptions.
In other words, consistency of rules has led to entries that seem
inconsistent to the public. For example, the rules for foreign name
prefixes call for ignoring the Dutch and German prefixes van and von
as entry words. As a result, von Goethe and van Beethoven are
easily found under G and B, where most readers will probably look.
Quite consistently, van Gogh is also to be found under G, although
few Americans would look for him there first.
</p>
<p>The rules for transliteration of Russian names are based on the
most accurate authority, and lead readers immediately to Chekhov,
but the same rule calls for Chaikovskii, a spelling unfortunately not
familiar to most music-lovers or Tchaikovskii- haters.
</p>
<p>The American Library Association and the Library of Congress
have made important exceptions to basic rides in order to take into
account the principle of probable association. Entry of librettos
under the name of the composer of the music is an example of appli-
cation of this principle to provide an exception to the general prin-
ciple of making main entry under author (a principle essential to
the author or union catalog, but not vital to the success of the dic-
tionary catalog, and therefore not included here).
</p>
<p>It is the principle of probable association that gives us title
main entries for serials, and title added entries for trade books. It
shows that title added entries for pamphlets and minor government
publications are not needed, since their titles will probably not be
remembered.
</p>
<p>It gives us the rules for entry of anonymous classics. It also
dictates added entries for the translators and editors of anonymous
classics and composite books, since many readers will probably</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35 - 7
</p>
<p>associate these with the personal names appearing on the title-pages.
It dictates the usefulness of personal added or main entries for many
government, society and institutional publications. It points out the
uselessness of personal name added entries for the routine reports
of officials of such organizations. It dictates the rules for the offi-
cial publications of governors and presidents of the United States,
and the different rules for their somewhat more personal writings,
sharply overriding in this case the principle of unique entry. It
dictates the form of author entry for kings and queens (under given
name).
</p>
<p>It will justify the use of the heading Carroll, Lewis for the fanci-
ful writings of a story-teller, and the use of the heading Dodgson,
Charles Lutwidge for the computations of a mathematician, again
sensibly overriding the principle of unique entry.
</p>
<p>It is not so arbitrary, however, as to forget the variety of ap-
proaches to these names. It is as much a demander of see references
as it is an arbiter of names.
</p>
<p>In the subject heading field, this is the principle that keeps our
</p>
<p>subject terminology up to date, and that demands cross-references
from synonyms. This principle causes the cataloger to keep a con-
stant watch for new terminology in the titles and subtitles of books
and pamphlets, constantly incorporating new words into the catalog
as cross-references to established headings, and by and by changing
the old headings as the new terminology takes a firmer grasp.
</p>
<p>This principle helps us decide on Alabama Polytechnic Institute
over Auburn, on QUOITS over HORSESHOE PITCHING, on Goethe
over von Goethe, and on Luce over Boothe. But it demands cross-
references from _all variant forms. Yet we make the cross-
reference
</p>
<p>Auburn, Ala. Polytechnic Institute
see
</p>
<p>Alabama. Polytechnic Institute, Auburn.
</p>
<p>But we do not make the reference
</p>

</p>
<p>Alabama. Polytechnic Institute. Chemistry Dept.
</p>
<p>We make
</p>
<p>Boothe, Clare

<p>QUOITS
</p>
<p>but not
</p>
<p>PITCHING HORSESHOES
see
</p>
<p>QUOITS .
</p>
<p>The final principle that enables us to distinguish the necessary
cross-references from theunnecessary may be called the principle of
inevitable association.
</p>
<p>The Principle of Inevitable Association
</p>
<p>This principle is the key to necessary and unnecessary cross-
references. In addition, it is the key to many unnecessary title added
entries. It also provides the basis for the internationally disputed and
</p>
<p>peculiarly American distinction between rules of entry for the publica-
tions of societies and rules of entry for the publications of institutions.
</p>
<p>Roughly, the principle dictates that if an author, personal or
</p>
<p>corporate, or a title, or a subject heading, will inevitably and ab-
</p>
<p>solutely be remembered by one of the words other than the first one
in its name, then that key word shall be the entry word and no specific
reference or entry is needed under the first word.
</p>
<p>Thus, if the University of Chicago will inevitably be remembered
by the word Chicago (it being impossible to remember it only by the
word "University"), then entry shall be under the name of the city.
No specific reference is needed under "University," merely a general
instruction card.
</p>
<p>According to this principle, entry for the following bodies becomes
clear:
</p>
<p>Free Library of Philadelphia.
Chamber of Commerce of Madison.
County of Washtenaw.
The Board of Education of the City of New York.
The Legislature of the State of Illinois.
The State University of Iowa.
Birdwatchers Club of San Francisco.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35 - 9
</p>
<p>This principle is thus the basis for the rules of entry for institu-
tions and local societies (nearly always identified with a city).
</p>
<p>It is also the basis of the rules of entry for national societies and
for institutions with names beginning with a proper noun or adjective
or geographic adjective. Since the principle obviously does not apply,
entry for these institutions and societies should be under their names:
</p>
<p>Northwestern University, Evanston.
Duke University, Durham.
American Library Association.
National Society for Crippled Children and Adults,
Yerkes Observatory, Williams Bay, Wis.
</p>
<p>The principle must be applied carefully. Just because the name
"University of Wisconsin 11 cannot be remembered by the word Univer-
sity alone does not mean that the word Wisconsin will inevitably be
associated with it in the reader's mind. Some readers may think of it
as the university at Madison, Wisconsin. This indicates the cross-
reference:
</p>
<p>Madison, Wis. University.
see
</p>
<p>Wisconsin. University.
</p>
<p>This reference would not be needed in a library in Madison or
even in Wisconsin. But the farther from Madison, the more useful
the reference. References for government institutions in foreign
countries from the names of the cities in which they are located are
particularly helpful to American readers who do not realize they are
government institutions .
</p>
<p>The principle of inevitable association also dictates the length of
entries for government agencies, as well as the fact of entry under
the name of the government. If the name of a subordinate agency is
inevitably linked with that of a superior agency, the names of both
agencies should be included in the heading. Thus, entry for the
Reference Dept. of the General Reference and Bibliography Division
of the Library of Congress will be:
</p>
<p>U.S. Library of Congress. Reference Dept.
not
</p>
<p>U.S. Reference Dept.
</p>
<p>Readers will inevitably know the name of the library, so that no
reference is needed. The form of this heading should not be
</p>
<p>U.S. Library of Congress. General Reference and
Bibliography Division. Reference Dept.
</p>
<p>dince the term General Reference and Bibliography Division is
not inevitably conjured up by the name Reference Dept. A reference
from this form to the correct heading is, of course, in order.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35 - 10
</p>
<p>The principle of inevitable association is also operative in the
field of entry for personal names . It dictates that entry be made
under a man's surname rather than his given name, and that no
cross-reference is needed. When the surname is not obvious, the
principle of probable association takes over, and cross-references
are brought into play, if necessary.
</p>
<p>The principle of inevitable association is also responsible for
the age-old battle between those who would always enter periodicals
and other serials under title (advocates are especially numerous
overseas), and those (mostly Americans) who would enter under
title "only when the title is distinctive. The trouble with the Ameri-
can view is that nobody has tried successfully to define a "distinctive"
title . The principle of inevitable association does just that. If a
serial title inevitably includes or implies inclusion of the name of an
organization, main entry under the name of the organization is indi-
cated, with no added entry under or reference from the first word of
the title. Thus the Journal of the American Marketing'Aseociation is
entered:
</p>
<p>American Marketing Association.
Journal.
</p>
<p>with no added entry or reference under Journal. But the Journal of
Aviation Medicine must be entered under title, since the name of TTs
sponsoring body is not inevitably remembered as a part of its title .
</p>
<p>The principle of inevitable association also makes possible the
omission of numerous title added entries for books with titles that
include the name of the author or subject heading. Because of this
principle, no added entries are needed for the following titles:
</p>
<p>Ludwig van Beethoven.
The Comedies of Shakespeare .
The History of the United States.
Principles of Economics .
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the file of cards under the author or subject
entry is large, and the title is fairly unusual, it may require much
more time for the reader to find the title under author or subject,
so that the title entry is a convenience, though not essential. Thus:
</p>
<p>The Psychology of War.
The Idiosyncrasies of Shakespeare.
Abraham Lincoln, the War Years.
</p>
<p>The principle of inevitable association is much in evidence in
our subject heading lists. This is the principle that almost com-
pletely eliminates verbs from the standard lists. Thus, although we
chose QUOITS, and need a cross-reference from HORSESHOE
PITCHING, we do not need a reference from PITCHING HORSE-
SHOES, for HORSESHOES is inevitably associated with this phrase
and the reader who finds nothing under PITCHING cannot possibly
forget the word horseshoes without literally forgetting his subject.
Only a few present participles remain in the lists. These consist</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35 - 11
</p>
<p>mainly of activities represented by intransitive verbs , such as
RUNNING; SWIMMING; etc. Some participles of transitive verbs
are found, however , e.g. SMUGGLING.
</p>
<p>The principle of inevitable association could be applied to our
numerous adjective headings. Although she did not give expression
to it, it was undoubtedly recognition of a part of this principle that
led Miss Prevost to develop her noun theory of subject headings.
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>The larger principle gives full support to Miss Prevost1 s theory,
and it is to be hoped that the Library of Congress will reverse its
trend toward more and more adjective headings. This trend is based
on apparent confusion of the principle of specific entry with the prin-
ciple of direct (or adjective) entry at the Library of Congress. The
latter principle is effectively characterized by Miss Prevost, and has
little to be said for it. While adjective entry does represent every-day
speech, there is reason to believe that readers instinctively look under
the noun first, at least partly because of the widespread use of the
noun theory of entry in the indexes to books and individual periodicals.
</p>
<p>The theory of inevitable association would seem also to call for
an increasing use of the practice of indirect geographic subdivision
under subjects rather than the direct form to which the Library of
Congress has increasingly committed all American libraries.

<p>CHAPTER 36
</p>
<p>Monographs in Series *
</p>
<p>Monographs in series possess, separately, all of the character-
istics of individually published treatises on separate subjects. Each
monograph has, generally, its own author, title and subject matter --
different from the other monographs in the series. In addition, each
possesses a common series title, assigned by the publisher, that may
have considerable significance for the cataloger. If each volume in
the series is numbered, it becomes possible to catalog and classify
the series as a single set or serial, rather than to classify separately
each publication in the group. Separate classification for each volume
or title in the set results in "scattering 11 the set in various locations
on the shelves.
</p>
<p>A. To Scatter or Not to Scatter?
</p>
<p>A decision to scatter the volumes of the series or to classify them
together on the shelves must be made with the arrival of the first
volume in the series, unless cataloging is to be delayed until additional
volumes are received. For libraries receiving numerous monographs
in eries this is a very important decision, for it determines the
amount of attention that will have to be devoted to each future volume
by the catalog department. It has a great deal to do with the amount
of material on any one subject readers can find by going directly to
the class number for that subject without going to the card catalog.
For example, if Research report no. 36 of the Texas Engineering
Experiment Station is received, and classified in 371 .62 (the Decimal
Classification number for school buildings and equipment), it becomes
necessary, if conventional cataloging habits are followed, to make
entries for the two authors, Caudill and Reed, as well as a subject
card for the*work, which is titled Geometry of Classrooms as Related
to Natural Lighting and Natural Ventilation . While the library is wait-
ing for Library of Congress cards the monograph must be shelved in
some temporary location, or a special procedure for classifying
without cataloging must be invoked. Worse than this, however, is
the precedent set for the future. Once one number in the series is
separately cataloged, all future numbers will have to be so treated,
unless the decision to scatter is reversed, in which case there will
be a strong temptation to recatalog no. 36 to "put it with the set. 11
</p>
<p>Many catalog administrators decide whether or not to scatter a

out illustration, in College and Research Libraries 15:271-6, July

</p>
<p>series on the basis of regularity of receipt of the issues , but this
</p>
<p>practice often results in burdening the department with a mass of
unanticipated monographs requiring separate cataloging. General
practice is to scatter sets of which the different volumes are sep-
arately ordered on the basis of individual merit and need, and to
</p>
<p>classify sets together only if (but not necessarily when) the library
has placed a standing order for the series. Thus many sets are
scattered that would have been kept together had the library only
placed a standing order at the beginning. Such a policy is neither
</p>
<p>logical nor desirable. Series should be scattered or kept together on
the basis of their own merits and the needs of the library and not on
the basis of regularity of receipt. Catalogers who assume the library
is not "likely" to receive any more volumes in a series may be ex-
pected to guess wrong in a good percentage of cases, for, after all,
would they not have made the same negative guess prior to publication
of the volume in hand?
</p>
<p>The cost, to the catalog department, in terms of future staff
time "reserved" for separate cataloging of future titles of scattered
series may be measured by counting the number of series cards filed
per month or year for such volumes, and multiplying it by the per
volume cost of cataloging. The figure thus obtained represents a
continuing encumbrance against the time available for all work by
the cataloging staff, time that will be forever lost to other duties.
Such a figure may be expected to remain constant in most libraries,
or even to increase slightly. The administrator must weigh this
cost against the advantages of separate classification for such mono-
graphs. If he does not reverse the policy, it may be assumed that
he feels the practice to be worth its cost.
</p>
<p>The cost of the alternative method may be measured in terms of
the cost of adding volumes to sets already cataloged, obviously less
than the cost of separate cataloging. Other hidden costs may include
the extra work, for patrons or the staff, of using printed bibliograph-
ies to identify the series titles of monographs not found under author,
title or subject in the catalog.
</p>
<p>Public libraries are specially liberal about scattering sets; only
a few of the largest ones take advantage of the savings that may be
obtained by a parsimonious scattering policy. Since acquisition is
inevitably governed by time available for processing (especially in
public libraries), these libraries are actually depriving themselves
of materials in order to shelve by subject the smaller number of
titles that can be processed under a "liberal" scattering policy.
</p>
<p>Catalog administrators must be careful not to commit too high a
percentage of departmental time to monographs in series that must
be separately cataloged. It is the author's opinion that no library
can build a great research collection,except at fantastic processing
cost, unless it carefully limits its scattering policy.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36 - 3
</p>
<p>B . Criteria for Scattering
</p>
<p>Among the considerations to be weighed in deciding whether or not
to scatter monograph series are the following:
</p>
<p>1 . Regularity of receipt. This consideration has been discussed
above. Regardless of regularity, if there are to be any future acquisi-
tions, by accident or design, the catalog department will be committed
to devote "cataloging time," as opposed to "adding time" (time taken
to "add" them to the serial record or shelflist), to them.
</p>
<p>2. Series that are "out of scope." Long-established series, the
contents of which are known to include only rarely titles within the
scope of the library's acquisition policy, may be scattered without a
particularly large commitment on future time.
</p>
<p>3. Binding. If a series is paper- bound, to scatter it is to invoke
a commitment to bind separately all future volumes. Even pamphlet
binders are expensive. If the series is not to be scattered, several
volumes may be bound together. On the other hand, if the volumes
are published in cloth bindings, or are so thick as to require separate
binding, or are published in such odd sizes as to require separate
binding, this factor need not be considered in making the decision to
scatter or not.
</p>
<p>4. Variety of subject matter. If the series consists of titles on
closely related subjects, e.g. the Census Monographs of the Bureau
of the Census, and would shelve near each other even if scattered,
nothing is gained by scattering. On the other hand, such series as
the Reference Shelf would be more readily located, if scattered, by
readers browsing in an open- stack library. Libraries with stacks
divided on the subject-divisional plan might more logically pursue a
liberal scattering policy than libraries with central-core stacks,
although such libraries cannot hope to disperse all subject materials
appropriately, without resorting to scattering the articles that appear
in the general periodicals, or the chapters in books that deal with
overlapping subjects, etc.
</p>
<p>5. Availability of LC cards. If Library of Congress cards are
not available for each separate monograph in the series, then the en-
cumbrance on catalog department time resulting from a decision to
scatter the set is indeed heavy, whether or not series cards are
available from the Library of Congress. On the other hand, if
analytic cards are available from the Library of Congress, and a
series card is not available, it may well be cheaper to prepare the
series card locally and avoid the not inconsequential expenses inci-
dent to separate classification and cataloging with LC cards. The
analytic cards may be used anyhow, if the set is not scattered, at
considerably less cost than is entailed in their use as an adjunct to
separate classification, (see below)
</p>
<p>6. Numbering. If the monographs in the series are not num-
bered according to a system whereby each title can be identified
exclusively by series title and volume number (or date), it becomes</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36 - 4
</p>
<p>impossible or inadvisable not to scatter them. The cataloger must
otherwise supply arbitrary numbers to the volumes, and keep up-to-
date, on the catalog card,a key to these volume numbers; location
of the volumes is otherwise impossible. If the series title and num-
bering are placed on the volumes in a very obscure position, the cost
savings must be weighed carefully against the fact that bibliographical
citations are apt to omit mention of such series notes, even in such
bibliographically reliable publications as the indexes and catalogs of
the H.W . Wilson Company and the Library of Congress . This is likely
to be true of series with complex systems of numbering or cryptic
series titles, such as the "ARC 11 series published by the American
Red Cross, etc., since these series may go unrecognized as such,
or be dismissed as unimportant, by bibliographers, as indeed they
often are .
</p>
<p>7. Publisher. It is not advisable to classify together monographs
in series issued by "trade 11 publishers, even though numbered, for the
simple, if technically illogical, reason that librarians (let alone pa-
trons) do not expect to have to look under series titles to find such
series, and for the technically valid reason that bibliographers and
researchers almost universally omit mention of such series titles
in their catalogs, indexes and bibliographies. This latter factor
would render well-nigh impossible the identification and location of
such monographs if they were classified as sets.
</p>
<p>C . How to Scatter
</p>
<p>Monographs in series should generally be recorded in the con-
tinuation or serials record. If they were separately ordered, an
order card, Library of Congress card order slip, and cataloger s 1
work slip (for instructions to typist) may already have been pre-
pared. If not, these records will have to be made. The monographs
are then cataloged as though they were separate books, except that
a series added entry card for each one is filed in the card catalog
for the benefit of readers using the series approach, and who may
not know the author or title of the volume desired. Main cards for
scattered series are prepared by few libraries. When prepared,
they may carry some such legend as "For call numbers and titles
of individual volumes, see cards following," as shown in Fig. 36-1.
Such main cards are useful for carrying the tracing for cross-
references from series editors, previous (changed) series titles,
and from the names of societies, institutions or other corporate
bodies responsible for the series, when these are necessary.
Cross-references to the main card are preferred over added en-
tries for such names, since the reader is thus guided to the file of
series cards showing contents and call numbers. The cross-
references should be made even if no main card is prepared, and
in such cases should be traced in the library's cross-reference
authority file .
</p>
<p>In deciding on a main entry for the series, the principle of
inevitable association should be followed. Therefore, unless the
title is common to several series, series entry should be made</p>

take up a great deal of room when typed at the top of printed analytic
cards, and this is a good reason for preferring title main entry if the
principle of inevitable association does not clearly dictate the entry
one way or another. The series title is customarily given in the
singular when it appears in the singular on the individual monographs,
e.g. Bulletin 224, not Bulletins, no. 224.
</p>
<p>An alternative plan, for scattered series, involves replacement
of the series added entry cards by form cross-reference cards like
the ones shown in Fig. 36-2. These form cards are great time-
savers for catalogers. If used too freely, however, they may become
great sources of inconvenience, irritation and exasperation to read-
ers . They are especially useful for unnumbered series. For series
for which added entries have not been made in the past, they eliminate
the possible desirability of ferreting out the titles owned by the library
in order to provide series entries, and yet they provide the reader
with some reassurance that he is on the right track.</p>

<p>D. How to Classify as Sets
</p>
<p>Classification, as sets, of monographs in series is completed
when the initial volume is cataloged. Thereafter, succeeding vol-
umes are added to the serials record, shelflist, and catalog cards,
depending upon the number of places in which the holdings record
is duplicated in the library.
</p>
<p>Series, when cataloged and classified as such, are preferably
entered under title, unless the title is common to several different
series, e.g. Research report, Bulletin, etc., in which case entry
should be made under the name of the organization or person
responsible for the series, as shown in Fig. 36-3.

<p>Fig. 36-3. Main Card For a Monograph Series That
Is Not Scattered
</p>
<p>Main Library of Congress cards are not available for many
series, for that library has traditionally pursued a very liberal
scattering policy, fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately) for
American libraries. This policy has been augmented by a liberal
policy of analyzing a goodly proportion of even those series that
were not scattered. Library of Congress policy in these respects
springs from the desire to render good bibliographic service to
readers, but undoubtedly has its roots in the days when cataloging
time was not so scarce and expensive as now, and when the con-
cept that the library stacks (classification) should reveal as much
as possible of the subject content of a library was more popular
than it is today. These factors account, in part, for the scarcity
of main LC cards for series, and for the relative abundance of
LC analytic cards.</p>

<p>E . To Analyze or Not

analyzed; each separate monograph is given author, title and subject
cataloging. The main card for one of the monographs in a scattered
series is shown as Fig. 36-4. However, when sets are not scat-
tered, someone must decide whether or not to analyze the component

series is not scattered. The series note was
not given by the cataloger in entry form; con-
sequently it has been necessary to give it in

out of the imprint by the cataloger. What is
the value of having both entries no. II and III?
Is the extra effort really Justified? The Li-
brary of Congress would not have made entry no.
</p>
<p>II, according to its present policies, although
many catalogers would disagree. The word "For-
eigfc" is underscored in the added entries to
indicate filing practice; this library uses the
so-called nkey word system in filing subdivisions
of corporate bodies.
</p>
<p>One might at first think that the purpose of classifying mono-
graphs together would be defeated by a decision to go ahead and put
analytical cards in the catalog anyhow. Upon reflection, however,
the cataloger can see that, if the analytic cards can be obtained by
standing order from the Library of Congress, nearly all of the
savings resulting from not scattering the set will be salvaged. The
volumes may still be sent quickly to the stacks and classification of
each volume is avoided. Later, when the LC cards are received, the
call number (including the volume nuniber) and headings may be typed
on them without even calling the volume from the stacks; this practice
is widespread. Most libraries have a special "analytics 11 file, where
receipt of cards and volumes is noted. This file also contains a record</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36 - 10
</p>
<p>of the established series entry form, call number of the set, and other
information essential to the process whereby cataloging is undertaken
without consultation of the volumes. A sample card from such a file
is shown as Fig. 36-6. Of course* such records are maintained only
for series titles regularly received. If LC cards arrive before the
volume, they may be forwarded to the serial librarian with a form
request to claim the missing issue.
</p>
<p>Fig. 36-6. Card from "LC Standing Order File" in a
Library Receiving Sets of Analytic Cards
on Standing Order from the Library of Congress
This file simplifies the receipt, handling and
processing of analytics for monograph series,
reducing almost the entire procedure to the
clerical level. Generally, it is uneconomical
to place standing orders for analytics for scat*
tered sets, particularly if the library uses
multiple-carbon or similar temporary processing
forms. If LC cards are received before the vol-
ume, the volume number would be recorded in the
"Cards reed. 91 column, and one of the LC cards
would be sent to the serial record as a signal
to claim the missing volume* The letter "xn is
given at the end of the series entxy to indicate
the exact method of typing the volume number onto
the card. Had the series note in the volumes been
worded accordingly, this might have read "v.x" to
indicate wv.2" instead of "2." Note however that
the abbreviation "v. 11 is to be used in the call
number, even though it does not appear in the books.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36-11
</p>
<p>Among the factors that must be considered in deciding whether or
not to analyze the series are
</p>
<p>(1) Availability of LC cards. If analytic cards are not available
from the Library of Congress, the work of analysis will be terribly
time- consuming and costly. The list of series for which analytics
are prepared locally will be carefully scrutinized by the economy-
minded cataloging administrator .
</p>
<p>(2) Availability of printed indexes. Printed indexes available to
the public and to the reference librarians may be substituted for
costly catalog analysis. Such indexes a* the new Short Story
Index: and the Library of Congress Subject Catalog are expensive;
they do not earn their purchase price if their contents are duplicated
in the card catalog. This is not to say that series analyzed in the
Library of Congress printed catalogs should not be analyzed in the
library's card catalog; however, the titles chosen for analysis should
be chosen with care and with the expectation that the cards will be
frequently used.
</p>
<p>(3) Library holdings . If the library has a limited amount of ma-
terial in the subject area of a particular series of monographs, more
serious consideration should be given to analysis.
</p>
<p>(4) Demand. Institutional and reader interest in the subject area,
or lack thereof, may dictate the decision.
</p>
<p>(5) Local interest. If the series contains monographs by leading
local citizens, members of the faculty, or about local persons, places,
organizations, etc., analytic cards maybe made for these.
</p>
<p>F. Reference Books in Series
</p>
<p>The reference librarian, or the librarian of any special collection
in the library, occasionally asks that copies of certain monographs be
taken out of the set (if the set is not scattered) so that they may be
shelved in the special collection. Assuming that the desired titles
would be useful in the reference or other collection, the cataloger
should yield as gracefully as possible. Unless the library wishes to
purchase an extra copy for the reference collection, the continuity
and completeness of the set must be impaired by removal of the de-
sired volume. If the reference librarian feels strongly that it should
be shelved by subject, it should be ,so classified, rather than given
the call number of the series. Purchase of a duplicate copy should
be justified in terms of real need, and not in terms of a desire to
have all volumes in a set in one place.
</p>
<p>Hodge's Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico is more
appropriately shelved, in a reference collection 'where use is heavy
and the classification is important, under R970.1 than under R572.7,
the number that might be given to the Bureau of American Ethnology
Bulletin series in which this title was published. On the other hand,
reference collections are often small, and the reference librarians</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36 - 12
</p>
<p>would soon learn the volume's call number, no matter tohat it might
be. As long, however, as the catalog cards have to be changed to
indicate the special location of this particular volume it is not much
more difficult to please the reference librarian by classifying the
monograph by its subject. Such a note as MVol. 30 has call number
R970.1 H66h" should then be added to the main series cards. If the
set has been analyzed, the correct call number must be given on the
analytic cards.
</p>
<p>Catalogers should not allow themselves to be annoyed by such
special requests. This is especially true of catalogers who go blithely
along scattering whole series even though no one would care if they
were classified together.
</p>
<p>G. Who Decides?
</p>
<p>Who should decide whether series are to be scattered or kept
together? Some librarians maintain that such decisions are entirely
the function of the reference librarian, or the subject divisional
librarian, the officer responsible for the book collections, or other
members of the readers' services staff, since they alone know the
extent to which successful alternative cataloging methods, i.e.
printed indexes, may be used. Others maintain that the catalog
administrator alone is aware of the commitments on the time of his
staff that are made by such decisions, and that he knows better how
badly the time of his staff is needed for other work. Others maintain
that it makes little difference who decides, as long as the deciding
officer keeps in mind both (1) needs of readers in terms of ability
to find books under the specific class numbers for their contents,
and (2) the effect of such decisions on the catalog department and on
its ability to perform with maximum efficiency.
</p>
<p>It is to be expected that if the decision is left to those in charge of
readers' services, more sets will be scattered than if the decision is
left to those in charge of technical services. Some high-level library
executives may wish to make the decision themselves.
</p>
<p>The decision to scatter or not to scatter monographs in series is
one of sufficient importance and has such far-reachiig effects on li-

ministrators at the cataloging level, technical processes level or

acquire a thorough understanding of how and why the decisions are
reached in his library, and of the effects of the prevailing policy.</p>

<p>Micropublication8
</p>
<p>A. Definitions
</p>
<p>1 . Micropublications
</p>
<p>The term micropublications is used to refer to publications
reproduced photographically in a size substantially reduced from
that of the original copy used for photographing. Micropublications
are usually reproductions of publications originally published in a
format legible to the naked eye. However, many micropublications
are published originally in this form, never having been previously
published in any other form. Original micropublications are usually
photographed from typewritten or manuscript copy. The term micro-
copies is used interchangeably with the term micropublications.
Definitions for microfilm and microprint, the two most common types
of micropublications are given below. Other words are in common
usage for specialized forms of these two basic types.
</p>
<p>2. Microfilm Publications
</p>
<p>A microfilm publication is a micropubli cation prepared by photo-
graphing the original copy on negative roll or sheet film, which is
read by projection of light through the transparent parts of the film to
produce a magnified image. Additional (positive) copies may be made
from the original negative.
</p>
<p>3 . Microprint
</p>
<p>A microprint publication is a xnicropublication made by photo-
graphing original copy (substantially reducing the size of the photo-
graphic image), preparing a lithographic plate from the film, and then
printing the result on a printing press in editions of multiple copies.
</p>
<p>The term "microprint 11 is usually used to refer to microprinted
publications of the Readex Corporation, founded by Albert Boni.
Readex holds a patent on the technique of reproducing one hundred
pages on a single microprint sheet, ten across and ten down.
</p>
<p>The term "znicrocard11 is a trademark of the Microcard Founda-
tion of the University of Wisconsin Press. The term refers to micro*
print reproduced on cards of the standard size for library catalog
cards (i.e. 12.5 x 7.5 centimeters).
</p>
<p>The Readex Corporation and the Microcard Foundatibn have de-
veloped special reading machines for reading their micropublications.

<p>37-2
</p>
<p>B. Merits of Each Type of Mi cropubli cation
</p>
<p>The principal merit of micropublication is its space- saving
feature 9 but different types of micropublication have different uses.
</p>
<p>Microprint is a more economical medium of reproduction if many
copies are to be produced, because, although "make- ready" costs
(preparation of plate, and press make- ready) are high, costs are
drastically lowered if numerous copies are made, for the copies may
be mass-produced.
</p>
<p>Microfilm, on the other hand, is cheaper initially than micro-
print, if for no other reason than that a lithographic plate is unneces-
</p>
<p>sary. However, extra copies cannot be mass-produced, and the third
copy costs practically as much as the second, the fourth practically
as much as the third, etc.
</p>
<p>Thus, microprint seems to be economical when numerous copies
are wanted, and microfilm where only one or two (or at most a very
few) copies are needed.
</p>
<p>There are other considerations. Microfilm rolls appear to be
harder to use than sheet film (though the latter is still uncommon in
libraries) and also harder to use than microprint. Microprint is not
</p>
<p>easily enlarged, whereas microfilm is, so that scholars can make
full-size copies from microfilm copies but not from microprint copies.
Microcards are more difficult to use than sheet microprint, owing to
the Boni patent on the arrangement of one hundred pages in ten
columns. Initially there were difficulties in manufacturing suitable
equipment for reading sheet microprint. These difficulties appear
now to have been overcome.
</p>
<p>Sensational claims were made for Microcards by their inventor
when he first announced their "invention." "Now microcards. . . save
somewhere between 95% and 99% of their present cataloging cost. . . .
A regular fullsize book - on the back of one single catalog card. . . ."
These claims have since been withdrawn by him. Microcards have
no advantages over sheet microprint except any that might stem from
their different size. This puts the Microcard Foundation in the posi-
tion of being to the micropublication field what RCA Victor was to the
phonograph record field when it introduced the 45 r.p.xn. record,
following upon the heels of Columbia Records 1 revolutionary 33 1/3
r.p.m. disc, in 1948. Like RCA Victor's, the Microcard Founda-
tion's product has prospered because of a good inexpensive machine,
superior financial backing (the full story of Microcards 1 financial
backing has not been printed), sensational publicity, and a handy
size. The claims of the Foundation that the Microcard is just the
optimum size and that, "in most cases" 2 one card to each book will

ately reckoned.
</p>
<p>C. Cataloging Problems
</p>
<p>Cataloging procedures for mi cropublications must take into ac-
count two major considerations: (1) whether or not the materials are
of a type ordinarily classified by the library, i.e. either periodicals
(often not classified) or separates (usually classified), and (2) whether
Library of Congress cards are available for the full-size edition or
not. Thus, four classes of materials can be dealt with on this basis:
</p>
<p>1 . Material not to be classified
a. With LC cards
b. Without LC cards
</p>
<p>2. Material to be classified
a. With LC cards
b. Without LC cards
</p>
<p>Group 1 (not to be classified) consists, in many libraries, of
periodicals, but this group is not found in numerous libraries. This
group exists only if the library policy is to catalog periodicals with-
out classifying them. If the library policy is to both catalog and
classify periodicals, these materials fall into group 2; if the library
policy is neither to classify nor catalog them, they fall outside of
the scope of this book on cataloging. Anybody can "not- classify11
and "not- catalog" anything.
</p>
<p>Group 1. Not-to-be-classified Materials
</p>
<p>Groups a and b (not- to-be- classified materials with or without
LC cards) are treated as simply as possible. Since most of these
are title entries (periodicals) the Library of Congress or locally-
prepared cards can be filed alphabetically, without call numbers,
in the card catalog, provided they state whether the material is in
microfilm, microprint, or microcard form. Some libraries may
wish to use Cutter or other book numbers on film, boxes or micro-
cards and on catalog cards to simplify filing and locating problems.
Other libraries use simple serial numbers (starting with 1) on the
catalog cards and on the microcopies. Cf. Fig. 37-1.
</p>
<p>If serial book numbers are not used, the film boxes, micro-
print, or xnicrocards must be filed alphabetically by main entry.

</p>
<p>Group 2 . Classified Materials
</p>
<p>Much of the material to be classified will be monographic (copies
of books or pamphlets). However, since most libraries classify ir-
regular or infrequently published serials (continuations), much serial
material is included in this group. In libraries that classify periodi-
cals, all micropublications will fall into group 2. Cf. Figs. 37-2 b 3.
</p>
<p>This group is divided here into two subgroups: (2a) titles for
which LC cards are available, and (2b) titles for which LC cards are
not available. The Library of Congress has established rules for
cataloging micropubli cations^ and, of course, catalogers at that
institution are not faced with the problem of cataloging microfilm
copies of titles for which LC cards are available, for, if the LC
cards are available, the microfilm copy is treated merely as a copy
and "dashed 11 onto the catalog cards. Thus, group 2a does not present
a
cataloging problem at the Library of Congress. All micro-
</p>
<p>publications needing cataloging at the Library of Congress fall into
our group 2b.
</p>
<p>Group 2b is therefore the main concern of the Library of Congress
rules. These rules differ in several respects from those for books.
The principal difference lies in the treatment of the collation, which
is described in terms of the micropublication, if on more than one card or
jreel, with the collation of the original being given in a note. The
example (Fig. 37-3) is taken from the LC rules. 5
</p>
<p>Though group 2a does not exist at the Library of Congress^ it is
a very large group in other American libraries, many of which buy
microcopies of publications of which the Library of Congress owns
the original. Obviously, it is only economical cataloging to buy the
Library of Congress cards for the original, noting on them that the
library copy is a micropublication (specifically stating which kind
and how many reels, sheets or cards, if more than one).
</p>
<p>It can now be seen that if libraries cataloged some materials by
adapting LC cards, as above, and if they cataloged other materials
for which LC cards are not available by employing the LC rules,
two basic types of catalog cards would result: (1) some cards with
the collation of the original in the regular collation position, with a
note specifying micropublication details, and (2) other cards with the
collation of the original in a note, with the microcopy collation (if
any) in the regular collation position.

</p>
<p>Obviously, there 10 no logic in employing two basically different
systems at the same time, in the same library, for one type of pub-
lication.' It is therefore irecommended that cards for locally cata-
loged titles be prepared as though the work being cataloged were the
original, with details of mi cropubli cation in a note. Thus, the LC
"collation of the original" note (rule 10:4B) would be abandoned, e.g.

<p>D. Classification of Mi crepublications
</p>
<p>Many librarians do not classify mi cropubli cations, but many of
the same arguments apply for classifying them that apply to classify-
ing books. A number simplifies the task of locating, shelving and
reshelving micropublications. However, it is true that micropublica-
tions do not lend themselves readily to browsing, as do books. There-
fore some librarians are content to assign a serial number to micro-
publications, e.g. in order of receipt. For purposes of positive
identification, such numbers should be assigned to each title , rather
than to each reel, even if there is more than one title on a reel.
</p>
<p>Other librarians find it expedient to classify micropublications
according to the classification system used for books. In such c&amp;ses,
a very short class number would seem adequate, since browsing is
infrequent and difficult. Book numbers should be used if positive
identification of each title is desired; these may be serial book num-
bers, or Cutter -type ones.
</p>
<p>For example,the Microcard copy of Myrdal's Population, a
Problem for Democracy, may be assigned any of the following types</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>37 - 8
</p>
<p>of call numbers:
(1) (2) (3)
</p>
<p>Serial Number Decimal Class Number Decimal Class Number
Serial Book Number Cutter- type Book Number
</p>
<p>MC[Microcard] MC [Microcardl MC [Microcard]
1 53 [Serial no . ] 3 12 [Population] 3 12 {Population]
</p>
<p>5 [Serial no.] M9 [Myrdal]
</p>
<p>Other types of numbers are in use. Some libraries do not use a
shelving symbol for sheet microprint! preferring to shelve it with
</p>
<p>ordinary books.
</p>
<p>The Microcard Foundation, through its central control of Micro-
card publication, and its publication of an annual catalog, missed its
only real chance at making Microcards at least partially self- cata-
loging when it failed to provide a unique "manufacturer's number 1 ' for
every title. Such numbers, printed in its annual catalog and in other
bibliographical sources, could have been used as universal call num-
bers, and Microcards could have been shelved by these numbers, in
card-number order within each tide ziumber. Instead the Foundation
recommended that each manufacturer assign a different card number to
each Microcard, e.g. Sp-51-1 (Springfield College, 1951, card no. 1)
so that a single title may have several different numbers (one for each
Microcard). Worse, these numbers do not always run in correct aer-
ial sequence (in many cases). As a result, use as a universal shelving
device is difficult and awkward, and the advantages of universal call
numbers are lost. The irony of this particular situation is that the
inventor of the Microcard was at one time an advocate of universal
call numbers. '
</p>
<p>E. Subject Headings
</p>
<p>Subject headings for micropublications are customarily like those
for full-size editions. Few, if any, libraries have adopted such subject
subdivisions as "--MICROFILM", "--MICROPRINT", etc., probably
on the ground that the nature of the medium makes little difference to
readers. In view of the aversion of many readers to various forms of
micropublication, it would seem that segregation of subject cards for
micropublications by the use of some such device might have somt ad-
vantages possibly outweighed by the fact that such an arrangement
would prevent some readers from discovering important materials.
In any event, the information that a publication is a microcopy does,
of course, appear on each catalog card.

<p>CHAPTER 38
</p>
<p>Motion Pictures and Filmatrip a
</p>
<p>A. Purpose of Cataloging
</p>
<p>Motion pictures are cataloged to provide a record of (1) names of
films available in the library, and (2) subjects about which films are
available in the library. Cataloging is especially important for films
because their physical nature makes it difficult to "browse 11 among
films in the manner in which readers browse among books.
</p>
<p>B* Alternatives to Card Catalogs
</p>
<p>Some libraries arrange their films by title, relying on distributors 1
</p>
<p>catalogs to provide subject and other approaches. Others classify their
films, but prepare printed catalogs instead of card catalogs. Printed
catalogs are useful for distribution to local or campus agencies and
persons who use the motion-picture collection. Printed catalogs get
out of date. Some libraries keep the card catalog up to date, and pre-
pare copy for new editions of their printed catalogs by copying the
catalog cards in sequence.
</p>
<p>C . Sources of Cataloging Information
</p>
<p>Films may be cataloged from sources other than the film itself;
however, care should be taken to use reasonably authoritative sources.
The unit card may be made up from information supplied by producers 1
catalogs, the Educational Film Guide, or similar sources. However,
the title (and subtitle) should be transcribed from the film itself.
Cataloging practice should follow the Rules for Descriptive Cataloging
in the Library of Congress; Motion Pictures and Film strips (Zd prelim.
ed, , Washington, 1955).
</p>
<p>D - Main Entry
</p>
<p>Main entry for motion pictures is generally made under title, since
most films are collaboratively prepared and usually not known by the
name of a person or organization.
</p>
<p>E . Imprint
</p>
<p>The place of production is omitted from the card for films . How-
ever, sponsors, producers and releasing agents are given. Dates of
release are also supplied, e.g.
</p>
<p>38 - 1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>38-3
</p>
<p>organizations that produce films (or have them produced) for reasons
other than monetary profit. Added entries for organizations producing
or releasing films mainly for profit (film trade publishers) would seem
to have little value in any kind of library. To make entries for film
publishers is comparable to making added entries, for books, for pub-
lishers like Harper, Macmillan, McGraw-Hill, etc.
</p>
<p>J . Arrangement of Films
</p>
<p>Films are commonly arranged in one of three ways: (1) by a sub-
ject classification number (Dewey, Library of Congress, etc.), (2) by
a serial number, and (3) by title. For purposes of cataloging, a nota-
tion is desirable, and this notation should Include a symbol, e.g. "F 11 ,
to indicate that the medium is film, as well as symbols for film width
and spool diameter, if 35 mm. film is separated from 16 mm. film,
and if large spools are shelved apart from smaller ones. The following
call numbers for the film "Rural Health 11 employ a notation based on
these considerations:
</p>
<p>(1) (2) (3)
</p>
<p>Subject classification (Dewey) Serial number Title Cutter number
F16L F16L-15 F16L
614 or R9
R9 16L
</p>
<p>IS
</p>
<p>In these examples, MF16LiM indicates 16mm. film on a large spool.
In example (2) "15" is the film's serial number in group 16JL. "R9" is
a Cutter- type number standing for the word "rural". The "F" may be
omitted, of course, in libraries containing nothing but film.
</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of title arrangement are lost when films are
shelved first by width and spool- diameter . However, considerable shelf
space is saved if spools of small diameter are shelved apart from those
with large diameter. Some libraries interfile 16mm. and 35mm. films.
</p>
<p>K. Filmstrips
</p>
<p>Film strips may be cataloged in a manner similar to motion pic-
tures. The number of frames is shown instead of duration, and to the
subject headings may be added the subdivision " FILMSTRIPS" unless
there is a separate catalog just for filmstrips, in which case the sub-
division is not needed.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 39
</p>
<p>Maps
</p>
<p>A. Purpose of cataloging
</p>
<p>When maps are cataloged, it is principally for one or more of
three reasons.
</p>
<p>First, they generally require two direct approaches, area and
subject, only one of which can be met by physical arrangement. A
rainfall map of South Dakota must be filed under either "rainfall 11
or "South Dakota11 , but cannot be filed both ways. If "South Dakota' 1
is chosen for filing, the "rainfall 11 approach may be made only via
indexing, or cataloging. It is true that all the maps of South Dakota
could be examined to see if a rainfall map were included, but if none
were located,, the reader would have to examine all the regional maps
to see if a regional rainfall map existed that included South Dakota. If
no regional rainfall map were found, the national maps would have to
be examined , etc
</p>
<p>A second reason why maps are often cataloged is that they do not
lend themselves to browsing as readily as do books.
</p>
<p>A third reason, in the large map collection, is that of preventing
duplication and of locating a particular map produced by a particular
cartographer. This is the author approach, of course, and the tech-
niques differ little from those employed in responding to the author
approach to books. In many smaller map collections, the author ap-
proach is so rare that it is not provided for. Unless there are a great
many maps of a particular geographic or subject area, the author ap-
proach to a particular map can be provided for by hunting through the
maps on that area or subject.
</p>
<p>B. Arrangement of maps
</p>
<p>Most maps are flat (when unfoldedj and are housed horizontally
in specially made map cases. Maps in unusual sizes or shapes or
with certain other characteristics that do not lend themselves readily
to flat filing must be segregated from the flat maps.
</p>
<p>A choice must be made between the two most logical ways of
arranging flat maps by area, or by subject. The most commonly
used method is by area, with subarrangement by subject. This
method scatters all the rainfall maps, but keeps together those of
South Dakota. It is probably more common because, generally speak-
ing, persons employing the subject approach nearly always limit the
object of their search to a specific area, whereas persons employing
</p>
<p>39 - 1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>39 - 2
</p>
<p>the area approach do not so frequently limit their searches to a specific
subject- type of map*
</p>
<p>Under each subject, maps are generally arranged by date, although
some libraries employ the less useful method of subarrangement under
subject by authority (cartographer, publisher, etc.)* Subarrangement
under subject by date is specially useful for maps in the social, natural
and technical sciences, and less so for maps in the humanities. A
combination of the two methods may be employed.
</p>
<p>As a device for "final 11 arrangement, i.e. for positive identifica-
tion of individual maps by call number, a symbol of some kind should
be employed, e.g. a Library-of-Congress-type book number.
</p>
<p>Classification schemes for maps are numerous. Among the most
practical are the Dewey Decimal system and those of the Library of
Congress, the American Geographical Society, and Boggs and Lewis. 1
While the Dewey Decimal system was not specifically designed for
maps, the tables for 930-999 of the 14th edition lend themselves admir-
ably to map classification, since they provide for subordination of
smaller areas to larger ones. Thus the maps of the cities, counties
and provinces of a country are arranged together in a hierarchical
sequence .
</p>
<p>The notation for a geological map of Wisconsin, as it might be
applied under both the Dewey and Library of Congress classifications,
is shown below:
</p>
<p>Dewey L.C.
977.5 area number (Wisconsin) GA458
55 subject number (geology) QE
1952 date 1952
W5a authority and identification W5a
</p>
<p>An alternative to formal classification is the arrangement of
maps without a formal notation. Many librarians arrange maps by
broad areas, followed by subordinate political divisions. Others
arrange them alphabetically by political unit, regardless of the size .
of the political unit. In such cases, the name of the political unit is
written on the map for filing purposes.
</p>
<p>Filing of maps without unfolding them subjects them to damage
caused by frequent unfolding and refolding.
</p>
<p>Large sets of maps may be kept together, especially if the sets
are well-known.

</p>
<p>C. Main entries for maps
</p>
<p>The ALA Cataloging Rules for Author and Title Entries (2d ed. f
Chicago, 1949) provide for entry of maps according to rules similar
to those for books.
</p>
<p>Since readers rarely employ the author approach to maps, many
libraries use as a main entry the name of the principal area depicted
by the map, with added entries for subordinate or other areas and sub-
jects.
</p>
<p>The advantage of using the author as main entry lies principally in
the fact that the cards may be readily interfiled with those for books,
and with map cards printed by the Library of Congress.

</p>
<p>A third method is to employ the author (or title) as main entry,
but actually to file the main entry card only in the shelflist, in which
would be kept the official record of tracings for the added and subject
entries used in the public catalog. This method is recommended for
librarians not wishing to provide for the author approach in the card
</p>
<p>catalog.
</p>
<p>To omit the author approach makes the task of preventing duplica-
tion of maps more difficult and more expensive, particularly in large
collections.
</p>
<p>D. Added entries
</p>
<p>Few added entries (other than subject entries) are usually needed.
In the largest libraries, entries for editors, publishers and engravers,
when not the main entry, may be useful.
</p>
<p>. Subject entries
</p>
<p>In accordance with the principle of specific entry, subject entries
should be made for the largest area fully covered by the map. Addi-
tional entries may be made for areas given adequate treatment on the
map, but not included within the territorial scope of the largest political
unit. Additional entries may be given for places depicted in important
insets, especially if maps of these areas are not easily found elsewhere
in the library. Subject entries should be made for topic divided by
place, e.g. Rainfall -- Ceylon -- Maps. The subdivision "--Maps 11
should, of course, be omitted if the maps are listed in a card catalog
of their own.
</p>
<p>F. Descriptive cataloging
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress Rules for Descriptive Cataloging (1949)
provide comprehensive rules for cataloging maps in Chapter o .
Therefore, only the most general suggestions will be given here. The
body of the unit card should include the title, place of publication ,
publisher if different from the author entry, and date. The collation
customarily denotes coloring, if any, and includes the word "map," or,
if a set is being cataloged, the number of maps, e.g. "2 colored maps.
The collation always includes the size of the map, which may be given
in inches, although the Library of Congress^ALA and large library
practice is generally to give the size in centimeters. The scale (re-
duction ratio) of the map is generally considered to be quite important,
particularly for the person making a choice of maps at the card cata-
log. It may be given in the collation;, many libraries, including the
Library of Congress ,give it as the first note . Special characteristics
and features of the map, if important to the person attempting to make
a choice of maps from the card catalog, should be described in notes.
The cataloger will find the LC rules very helpful in suggesting ways of
expressing such information concisely.</p>

</p>
<p>G. Index maps
</p>
<p>Index maps are maps of large areas which show, by means of
shading or outlining, and numbers, detailed maps that are available
for smaller areas. They are often provided by the publishers of large
sets of maps. In addition to indexing of maps in the card catalog, the
preparation of index maps provides a valuable service to readers.
Index maps may be kept for each broad subject covered by the collec-
tion. A good system of subject index maps may provide an excellent
alternative to map cataloging. They may show class numbers for each
regional or political unit, and even, if desired, the call numbers of
some or all of the individual maps in the library. If large quantities
of maps are acquired, however, the index maps may become crowded
and may require frequent retranscription.

</p>
<p>Title Added Entry versus Subject Added Entry
</p>
<p>Traditionally, American catalogers have been divided on the ques-
tion of title added entries for dictionary card catalogs. One group
has believed the card catalog should contain a title card for every
book. Other catalogers have felt this policy to be a wasteful one.
They have advocated making title cards only for selected titles.
Their number includes catalogers who would make title cards for
most books, and some catalogers who would (and do) make title cards
for a very small percentage of the books in a library collection.
</p>
<p>Library of Congress practice calls for making title entries for
works with "distinctive 11 titles. In addition, the Library of Congress
makes many title cross-references, referring to author entries.
These title cross-references are never traced on the printed cards.
As a result, .many American card catalogs do not have any cards at
all under these titles. This is the result of the catalogers
</p>
<p>1 failure to
realize that LC does provide, in its catalogs, for the title approach.
However, LC provides, in its card distribution service, for libraries
that make title cards for every book. These libraries use, in their
card-ordering formula, the letter "t", which means they wish to have
LC supply a title- card even if a title added entry is not traced on the
LC card.
</p>
<p>Why do some catalogers feel that title entries are needed for only
a few titles? Why do others feel that a title entry should be made for
every book?
</p>
<p>A. The Value of Title Entries
</p>
<p>Title entries are important for the reader who remembers the
title of a book but does not know the author or subject. Deprived of
the author and subject approaches, he literally cannot find the book
he wants unless a title entry appears in the card catalog. Some cata-
logers might advocate, of course, that he consult a bibliography that
would tell him who the author was, or what the book was about. Other
catalogers accept the obligation of service to such a reader and pro-
vide him with a title entry, feeling that to force him to locate the title
in a printed bibliography is to cause him unreasonable inconvenience.
</p>
<p>However, what of the reader who does know either the author or
the subject of his book? Of what value is the title card to him? If he
knows the author (and the title), the title card then becomes, not a
matter of necessity, but a matter of convenience. In cases when the
reader knows only the last name of the author, and if the last name is
Smith, then this convenience comes close to being a necessity, depend-
ing on the number of cards under Smith. However, if the reader
</p>
<p>40 - 1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40 - 2
</p>
<p>knows the full name of the author, he may use the title approach only
because he may happen to be standing at the catalog near that part of
the alphabet. If the reader knows the subject of his book (and the
title), the title card is also a matter of convenience . If the title is
Doorways to Science , he will find the book under its title entry more
readily, perhaps, than under its subject entry SCIENCE. If the title
card in this case is not supplied, it is not impossible for the reader
to locate the book. The card is a matter of considerable convenience,
however, because of the large number of entries under the subject
heading SCIENCE.
</p>
<p>Thus we see that the title card may be of great value for the
reader who knows the author and subject of his book, and a matter
of necessity for the reader who does not know the author or subject.
</p>
<p>B. Some Kinds of Title Added Entries
That Are Valuable
</p>
<p>In the example given above, Doorways to Science , the title entry
is valuable even though the reader knows the subject of his book. It
is much easier to find the title card than to locate the book under the
subject heading (itself easily located) chosen by the cataloger . The
problem for the reader here is the large number of entries under the
subject heading SCIENCE.
</p>
<p>Often, the subject heading itself is not easily located by the reader,
even though he may know perfectly well what the book is about. Thus
the book Attaining Maturity can be located readily under author or
title, but not so easily under the headings ABILITY, INFLUENCE OF
AGE ON; CHARACTERS AND CHARACTERISTICS; and ATTITUDE
(PSYCHOLOGY) assigned to it by the Library of Congress.
</p>
<p>Other title entries that are a great convenience to readers in-
clude those called "distinctive" or "striking" titles. By these two
terms, most catalogers mean titles that give no clue to the authors
or subjects of the books. Thus, the titles The Good Old Cause, (a
history), The Crippled Giant (a biography), and No Place to Hide
(about the effects of atomic radiation) are what would be called dis-
tinctive or striking titles. Readers not knowing their authors or sub-
jects simply could not find them in the card catalog without title added
entries. A large group of books considered to have distinctive titles
is almost the entire field of works of the imagination (novels, short
stories, plays, poetry, etc.). Since most of these books have no
subjects or subject headings, readers who do not know their authors
must be supplied with title entries. Thus, the reader who seeks Ten
North Frederick , and does not know John O'Hara wrote it, is helped
to find it by means of a title card.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40-3
</p>
<p>C . Title Added Entries That Are Not
Needed by Readers
</p>
<p>We have seen, then, that title added entries are made primarily
as a matter of convenience to readers. Some provide a greater con-
venience than others. In the case of some titles, the benefits for
readers are so slight as to make many catalogers feel they are not
worth the trouble. Thus, title entries for The Life of Dickens , The
History of the New York Central Railroad, The Fine Old Town of
Stonington, Facts About the Menopause, etc., are hardly needecT. In
most of these cases, a reader would go naturally to the correct sub-
ject heading without even thinking. Even if he chose to look under the
title entry first, he surely would not abandon his search if he did not
find a title card. This is one type of title entry catalogers usually
omit. The general principle they follow, then, is to omit title entries
when the name of the subject (or author) is clearly given or implied in
the title, and when the number of cards under the subject is not great.
This is simply an invocation of the principle of inevitable association.
Naturally, libraries in which this is done are careful not to proclaim
that "the catalog contains author, title and subject entries. 11 Instead,
signs, instructions and publicity should state that title entries are
included for most books if the author or subject heading is not clear
from the title .
</p>
<p>D. Title Entries That Duplicate Subject Entries
</p>
<p>Another type of title entry catalogers usually omit is the title that
is identical with a subject heading used for the book - Thus, the book
The Excess Profits Tax hardly needs both a title card and a card
uncTer the subject heacling EXCESS PROFITS TAX. The two cards
would file almost (if not) side by side unless the library used a
divided catalog (seebelow). Thus, when title and subject cards file
together, the title card should be omitted
</p>
<p>One may well ask the question,, but whv omit the title card? Why
not omit the subject card? What difference does it make which is
omitted if the two cards file side by side? The title card is omitted,
and the subject card is retained. because it is the subject card that
causes the subject heading to be established in the library's authority
file. The establishment of the subject heading permits the all-
important cross-references to be placed in the catalog. Having es-
tablished the subject heading EXCESS PROFITS TAX, the cataloger
may then place in the catalog the vital see and see -also references
from WAR PROFITS TAX, from TAXXTlON , and from INCOME
TAX. If the subject heading is omitted, the reader who looks under
EXCESS PROFITS TAX will find the title card, but the reader who
looks under the more general headings TAXATION or INCOME TAX
will not be referred to the proper heading. The reader who looks
under the heading WAR PROFITS TAX will be given no help at all.
For this reason, the subject entry card must be made even when the
title entry is mandatory (as in the case of main entries under title),
even though they file side by side .
</p>
<p>The same principle holds true when a title card and a subject</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40-4
</p>
<p>cross-reference would file side by side. The title card becomes un-
necessary, or even misleading (see below). Thus, the title card
for the book BeejyJgPfeft become s unnecessary in view of the cross-
reference BEEKEEPING see BEE CULTURE (the subject heading
where the book is listed). In addition, the presence of the title card
may cause some readers to overlook or ignore the cross-reference.
Overlooking the reference will deprive them of the many books on
beekeeping that may be listed under the heading BEE CULTURE.
</p>
<p>E. Title Added Entries That Are Misleading
</p>
<p>Frequently, the title card is not only unnecessary, but actually
misleading to readers. Untrained users of the catalog in public,
college and research libraries can hardly be expected to distinguish
between the typographical format of title and subject added entry
cards. Upon query, they may quickly reply that they know
</p>
<p>'"
</p>
<p>subject headings are typed in solid capitals or in red ink. Faced
with a title card for the book Mechanics of Materials , by H.D .Conway,
the reader may overlook the fact that all of the books on this subject
are listed under STRAINS AND STRESSES. The cross-reference
MECHANICS, see also STRAINS AND STRESSES may be only a few
cards (or a few inches) away, but this reader, for whom the title
Mechanics of Materials has now crystallized into a "subject, 11 can
reasonably T&gt;e expected to overlook it. He will, however, see only
one book listed under Mechanics of Materials . Unless the cataloger
has been alert, however, there will be no cross-reference from this
phrase to STRAINS AND STRESSES. Neither the LC list nor the
Sears list recommends such a reference. Can this reader be blamed
for thinking this is the only book the library has on the subject? This
is the sort of title added entry that should be omitted.
</p>
<p>F. New Terminology in Titles of Books
</p>
<p>To prevent occurrences of this type, the cataloger must be con-
stantly on the look-out for new terminology. Since most authors try
to assign to their books titles that convey the subject matter, this is
really a very simple task. All the cataloger needs to do is to watch
the titles of the books passing through his hands. The alert subject
cataloger will place cross-references under the new terms used by
authors in their titles, referring to the standard subject headings.
When the standard headings become out of date, they will be changed
and the -cross- references reversed.
</p>
<p>The subject cataloger who wants to avoid misleading the reader
into thinking the title entry is the place where all the books on that
subject are listed will omit the title entry whenever it files side by
side with a cross-reference. This will prevent the reader from
overlooking the cross-reference.
</p>
<p>If the cataloger is reluctant to follow this policy, a practical
alternative is to add subject tracings to title cards, stamping, per-
haps in red ink, the cards in the white space just above the tracings</p>
<p/>
</div>

Title Added Entries
</p>
<p>G. How-To-Do-It Books
</p>
<p>As an example of the far-reaching implications of the phrase
"misleading title added entry," consider titles beginning with the
words "How to." Among the titles in this category are How to Swim
Well, How to Give a Fashion Show , How jk&gt; Know the Spring fTowers ,
How to ReacTa Book. Are there not some readers, particularly in
schooTand puElic -- and even college -- libraries, who may have been
advised by a friend or teacher to learn how to swim better,, or how to
read better, etc.? If these readers look under "how to" (or any other
existing title entries), they may easily jump to the conclusion that
this is the place where the books on how to do various things are listed.
It is not surprising, especially if there are a large number of books
under "how to," that some readers will assume that this is the place
where ALL the how- to- do- it books are listed. Indeed, where else
would the how- to-do- it books be listed? Do not many libraries actu-
ally keep them together in a special section called "How To Do It
Booksy? And if they are kept together (in some libraries) on the
shelves, why not in the catalog?
</p>
<p>Readers will jump to these conclusions, and the list of books
under "how to" in most American card catalogs is not going to pre-
vent them from doing so. How can the librarian inform the reader
that only the how- to-do-it books that happen to have titles beginning
"how to" are listed under How to in the card catalog? This can be
done in one of three ways: (a) "Fy establishing the form heading HOW-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40-6
</p>
<p>TO-DO-IT BOOKS, (b) by deleting title cards from this part of the
alphabet, or (c) by stamping the title cards as shown in Fig. 40-1.
</p>
<p>The first method is not recommended, for it would create an
impossibly large collection of cards under the special heading, would
force catalogers to decide what a how- to-do- it book is, and would
train readers to expect to find subject headings under forms other
than the traditional noun and adjective headings .
</p>
<p>If the second method is followed, and the title cards under How to
are removed, a general instruction card would be needed. This migKl
read: "How to. ... Titles beginning 'How to 1 are listed under their
subjects. For example, How to give a fashion show is listed under
FASHION SHOWS. " This instruction might be all right for most books ,
but one wonders how a reader looking for the best- seller How To Live
365 Days a Tear would react to it.
</p>
<p>The third alternative is probably the best.
</p>
<p>H. Personal Names as Title Entries in
Fiction, Folklore and Reality
</p>
<p>Another type of title entry that is potentially misleading is often
made for book- titles consisting of a personal name . Consider Robin
Hood (the opera), Robin Hood (the title of a book about the legend)
Paul Bunyan ( stories about Paul Bunyan, the legendary lumberman),
John Sunyan (the title of a biography of the author of The Pilgrim's
'rogress), and Marjorie Morning 8tar (the novel). Traditionally,
catalogeds feel that readers automatically distinguish between such
personal names when used for imaginary persons and when used by
real people. Thus, for Marjorie Morning star a title entry will prob-
ably be made under Marjorie, for Robin Hood (opera) a title entry
under Robin, for Paul Bunyan (legendary figure) a subject entry under
Bunyan, for Robin Hood (legendary figure) a subject entry under
Robin [sic] , and for John Bunyan a subject entry under Bunyan.
Readers are expected to follow this curious pattern (or lack of pat-
tern, in the case of subject entry for legendary figures).
</p>
<p>A more consistent and more easily-learned policy would be to
enter all personal names under the surname(with the usual exceptions
for sovereigns and others whose surnames are not well-known).
Catalogers sometimes forget that most readers have not been to
library school.
</p>
<p>I. Title Added Entries in a Divided Catalog
</p>
<p>If the library has a divided catalog, the problem of the mislead-
ing title entry is If ss serious. The important question that remains
is then to ingrain the difference between titles and subjects into the
reader f s mind. Studies have shown that many a reader, when con-
fronted with a subject card,thinks the subject heading is the title,
and that the title is the cataloger's annotation. Call slips presented</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40 - 7
</p>
<p>by readers offer daily proof of this misconception. Other readers think
title entries are "subjects.
</p>
<p>11 If these misconceptions exist, does the
reader really go to the divided title (author-title) catalog when he wants
to locate the title Mechanics of Materials ? Can he be relied upon not
to look in the subject catalog? When he wants the subject "Revolution-
ary War", can he be relied upon not to look in the title catalog? Studies
have shown that all too often he does not make the proper distinction.
When he does not, the title added entry The Revolutionary War in the title
catalog can be even more misleading than in the dictionary catalog.
</p>
<p>Many catalogers feel that title added entries may be made more
freely for the divided catalog than for the dictionary catalog. Neverthe-
less, there are many title added entries that serve no need in the
author-title section of the divided catalog* Abraham Lincoln: the War
Years, The History of Ballet, and The Excess Profits TaxTre ex-
amples . These books may be located so easily in the subject catalog
that the convenience provided by the title cards does not justify their
cost or the space they occupy.
</p>
<p>J . A Title Added Entry Policy
</p>
<p>The cataloger should always remember that most readers do not
have much familiarity with forms and methods of entry. Consequently,
they will often fail to distinguish between title and subject added entries.
Titles filing next to subject headings and cross-references should be
omitted. Especially important, titles including subject terminology
should be omitted and replaced by see references referring to the cor-
rect subject heading, regardless of whether or not these cross-
references are suggested in the standard lists. The cataloger should
be constantly on the lookout for new terminology to be incorporated
into the library's subject cross-reference network. The titles of the
new books being cataloged are the best sources of new terminology.
</p>
<p>The cataloger should weigh the cost of making, filing and housing
title added entries against their potential value in terms of readers
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>convenience and need. Hence, the library policy should be to make added
entries for titles not conveying clearly the subject heading or author
</p>
<p>entry under which the book is listed. Exceptions must be made, of
course, for books not likely to be cited by their authors
</p>
<p>1 names
(anonymously published works, some edited works, etc.; cf. chapter
18).
</p>
<p>Catalogers and librarians should take great pains to warn readers
not to expect title entries for all books.

</p>
<p>The Classified Catalog
</p>
<p>A. What Is a Classified Catalog?
</p>
<p>A classified catalog is a subject catalog, arranged numerically by
any logical classification scheme instead of by the alphabet. Obviously
such a catalog cannot provide the author and title approaches, so that
one always finds a relatively conventional author and title catalog in
connection with a classified catalog.
</p>
<p>Since the catalog is arranged numerically by subject, it follows that
a reader who wants to select books on a certain subject must know the
number under which the books on that subject are listed. Thus, in a
library having a classified catalog for which the Decimal Classification
is used, a reader looking for material on the history of New York City
must know that the number standing for the history of New York City is
974.71 . Few readers are this familiar with the Decimal Classification.
It therefore becomes necessary to provide them with some way of finding
out the number of the subject they are interested in. One simple way of
doing this is by providing them with a copy of the index to the Decimal
Classification (it is published separately). A more satisfactory method,
however, is to provide an index on cards. Our reader looking for ma-
terial on New York City would, after entering the library, first look
under New York City in the subject index, where he would find a card
reading:
</p>
<p>NEW YORK CITY
see
</p>
<p>974-71 (New York City)
</p>
<p>o

Catalog.
</p>
<p>41 - 1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 2
</p>
<p>Then he would have to look under the subject heading 974.71 1 where he
would find the books the library owned on the history of New York City.
Each card on this subject will have the subject heading 974.71 at the top,
in the place where other libraries would put an alphabetical subject head-
ing.
</p>
<p>Thus, the library using a classified catalog always has a group of
THREE catalogs on cards. One of them lists authors and titles, another
contains subject index cards like the one shown, and the third part is the
subject catalog itself, arranged numerically. It is this third part that is
called the classified catalog. A sample card from such a catalog is
shown in Fig. 41-2. Note that the call number is given in the upper left

</p>
<p>B. Advantages
</p>
<p>Inevitably, the classified catalog must be compared with the alpha-
betical subject catalog. The proponents of the classified catalog will
point immediately to the way the alphabetical catalog scatters, from A
to Z, the specific aspects of any subject. Thus, anyone studying the
problem of hours of employment must look through the dictionary catalog
under such headings as Hours, Vacations, Holidays, Working days,
Workweek, Leaves. Overtime, Swing shift, Shift system, Night work,
Rest periods, Coffee breaks, never knowing when to stop. If the reader
has gained any insight at all into the principle of specific entry he knows
he must explore all possible terms. It does not matter whether the head-
ings named above have ever been used by a librarian, or whether they</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 3
</p>
<p>ever will be. As long as they might be, the reader must look, or run
the risk of overlooking important material. It is true that such specific
topics are supposed to be connected with the general topic HOURS OF
LABOR by see also references, but does the reader know this?
</p>
<p>In the classified catalog, the material on hours of work and work
periods will be listed in one place. In the Decimal Classification, this
is the number 331.81 and its subdivisions, listed below as shown in the
fourteenth edition:
</p>
<p>331.81 Duration of work Rest
See also 331.33 Working hours for children,
331 .41 Working hours for women
</p>
<p>.811 Length of day
8-hour day, 10-hour day, etc. Shifts of work
</p>
<p>.812 Night work
</p>
<p>.813 Sunday work
</p>
<p>.814 Overtime Supplementary hours
See also 331.65 Abuse of supernumerary time
</p>
<p>.816 Vacation Leave of absence
</p>
<p>.817 Holidays
Weekly rest, Sundays, labor festivals, May 1,
festivals of patron saints
</p>
<p>.818 In special industries
2-99 may be divided like 620-699 with 1 divided
like the whole classification for other industries;
e.g. 331.81822 Duration of work in mining,
331.818177 mphotografv
</p>
<p>.819 In special countries
Divided like 930-999, e.g- 331.8198 Duration of
work in South America
</p>
<p>If a reader is interested in only one aspect of the subject, say,
shifts, the approach to the classified catalog is simple -- to 331.811,
via a cross-reference in the index under SHIFTS, In the dictionary
catalog, he may approach this subject more directly, for theoretically
books are listed directly under the subject heading SHIFTS. Actually,
this headihg is not used in either the Sears or LC lists, nor does either
of them provide a cross-reference to another heading.
</p>
<p>If this reader wishes to explore related aspects of his topic, he will
find most of the related material close at hand in the classified catalog.
In the dictionary cataldg it will be scattered from A-Z (actually only
from C to W in this case, as the thirteen cross-references from HOURS
OF LABOR in the LC list, 5th ed. , go only from CHILDREN- -
EMPLOYMENT to WOMAN- -EMPLOYMENT.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 4
</p>
<p>Thus, with the classified catalog, the reader may -- in a sense --
have his cake and eat it, too. Cards on a specific, highly specialized
topic are segregated , just as in the dictionary catalog. Yet all the
cards for a broad general topic, including its specialized aspects, are
</p>
<p>kept together, too. This is the greatest advantage of the classified
</p>
<p>catalog, and is the most-frequently used argument for its superiority
over the alphabetical subject, or dictionary, catalog.
</p>
<p>Yet the classified catalog has other advantages, too. Most of these
stem from its "grouping 11 character. Thus, because
</p>
<p>" related11 subjects
are already together in the classified catalog, many see also references
may be eliminated. It is not necessary to say HOURS OF LABOR , see
also EIGHT HOUR MOVEMENT (one of the cross-references lietedUT
the LC list), for the cards for the two subjects are already close together
(331.81 and 331.811). Yet two see also references refer to EIGHT-HOUR
MOVEMENT in the LC List. Only one of these needs to be replaced by
the see-reference from EIGHT-HOUR DAY to 331.811 in the index to the
clas sified catalog .
</p>
<p>In the classified catalog, changes in terminology are more easily
dealt with, too. Note how easy it is to make the change from EIGHT-
HOUR MOVEMENT to EIGHT-HOUR DAY in the index to the classified
catalog. In the dictionary catalog, one must not only change the cross-
references that refer to EIGHT-HOUR MOVEMENT, but one must also
change the heading on the subject cards for the books themselves, as
well as the tracings on the main cards. In the classified catalog, when
a new term for a subject is first heard all one has to do is add a card to
the index under the new term. Thus, one may add the reference HOME-
MAKING, see 640, leaving the old card HOME ECONOMICS, see 640
undisturbed. The library that uses the dictionary catalog perhaps can-
not afford, because of the large number of cards to be erased and re-
typed, to change the heading ACCIDENTS- -PREVENTION- -SAFETY
EDUCATION in order to employ the terminology that has been in every-
day use for years. The library with a classified catalog would have put
in the cross-reference SAFETY EDUCATION, see 614.807, as soon as
the term had come into use .
</p>
<p>Opponents of the classified catalog maintain that some of the rela-
tionships in the classified catalog are just as absurd as some of the
old-fashioned terminology found in dictionary catalogs. These weak-
nesses result from weaknesses in whatever classification scheme is
used. These critics would be quick to point out that the 61'0's (Medi-
cine) are rather an odd place to put books on safety. On the other hand,
the proponents of the classified catalog will argue that if the dictionary
catalog crowd (and it is a big crowd) don't like 614 for Safety, why
do they use it for shelving their books? It may be argued that it is
better to clean up the inconsistencies of one system that everybody
uses anyhow (a numerical classification) than to have to clean up two
(a numerical classification for the books and an alphabetical one for
the cards) . One may also argue that use of the classification in the
catalog is beneficial to readers who must use the same classification
in the stacks .
</p>
<p>Closely tied in with its "relating" or "grouping" features is the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 5
</p>
<p>ability of the classified catalog to reveal, automatically, material that
</p>
<p>may become hidden under rather obscure, hard-to -think-of subject
headings. This is particularly true for material hidden in a dictionary
catalog by the so-called "general" cross-reference, e.g. BIRDS, see
also names of individual species, e.g. CANARIES. In such a case,
the reader looking for all material on birds in the library will have to
look up the name of every kind of bird in the world, even though the
library might have only a half-dozen books.
</p>
<p>Another important point in favor of the classified catalog is the
</p>
<p>economy that results from the cataloger's having to be concerned with
only one subject function instead of two. If the library has a dictionary
catalog, the cataloger must both classify and subject-head. If it has a
classified catalog, the cataloger is concerned with classification only
(a third operation - the preparation of the cross-reference network is
common to both types of catalogs, but performed only when cataloging
books in subject fields new to the collection). In classifying a book for
a collection that uses a dictionary catalog, the cataloger is concerned
only with the main subject of a book as far as the classification is con-
cerned. However, this operation may result in a decision between
several numbers, any of which might become added numerical entries
in a classified catalog, but which, in the alphabetical catalog, must be
converted into alphabetical headings. The cataloger for the alphabetical
catalog must use two reference aids -- the printed classification and the
printed list of subject headings, and also two frames of reference -- the
numerical and the alphabetical approaches. The cataloger for a classi-
fied catalog uses one tool, and one frame of reference. Again, of
course, one must exempt the cataloger working with books in subject
fields new to the collection, who will be specially concerned with the
alphabetical approach in both types of catalogs.
</p>
<p>Another important advantage of the classified catalog is that it may
be used by readers who speak different languages. It is true that the
index on cards in any one library is usually in a single language . How-
ever, a number of the "standard' 1 classifications (Dewey, UDC , etc.)
have printed indexes in other languages. Even if no index is available,
however, in the language of the reader, if he can only find his way to
the correct general area, he may be able to perceive the logical nature
of the classification, and thus to find specific topics.
</p>
<p>C . Disadvantages
</p>
<p>The most important disadvantage of the classified catalog lies in
the fact that its users must always look in two places for books on any
subject.* They must always look first in the index, then under the num-
ber. It may (and must be) argued that readers using the dictionary
catalog must often look in more than two places before finding the right
subject heading. However, it must be admitted that at least sometimes
it is possible (and does happen) that readers will find the right subject
heading on the first try. It is also true that a reader wanting material
on several aspects of a broad topic will have to look in more places in
an alphabetical catalog than in a classified one. However, the whole</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41- 6
</p>
<p>theory behind the dictionary catalog is based on the belief that most
readers are interested in only one aspect of a subject. Lacking de-
finite knowledge about readers
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>catalog-using habits (and research
is badly needed), it is impossible to say which approach is the more
common. Some readers want material on several or all aspects of
a broad topic, others on only one aspect. Both types of catalogs try
to provide for both types of readers. The dictionary catalog tries to
do with its cross-reference network what the classified catalog does
with its "relating" features. The classified catalog tries to do with
a close classification what the dictionary catalog tries to do with the
</p>
<p>theory of specific entry.
</p>
<p>A second disadvantage of the classified catalog, at least for clas-
sifiers, is that no good general classification with English- language
explanations of the numbers exists. The Universal Decimal Classifi-
cation has not been provided with a complete English- language explana-
tion except in an abridged edition. The complete English translation
now being published by the British Standards Institution will apparently
take many years to complete. No index is yet available.
</p>
<p>The Dewey Decimal classification, 15th edition, has been the sub-
ject of much criticism because of its inadequate detail for the book
collections of large and specialized libraries. Because a classification
for a card catalog requires eVen more detail than a classification for a
book collection (due to the fact that a card catalog should often provide
more than one subject heading - alphabetical or numerical - per book),
it goes without saying that the fifteenth edition is even less adequate for
a classified catalog than for a stack collection of books. The 14th edi-
tion of the Dewey Classification is considerably more suited to a clas-
sified catalog, but it is now not only out-dated but out-of-print as well.
The 16th edition is expected to become available in the near future.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress classification is not as suitable for a
classified catalog as it might have been made to be. This is partly
due to its lack of mnemonic features, but principally because of its
failure to employ the decimal principle. In the LC classification, the
specialized aspects of a subject do not necessarily have the same num-
ber as the larger aspects. Thus
</p>
<p>HD5106 Hours of labor
HD5199 Hours of labor in Denmark
HD5200 Hours of labor in Norway
HD5261 Vacations in the United States
</p>
<p>Another decided weakness of the LC classification as an arrange-
ment for a classified catalog is its predilection for alphabetical rather
than topical subdivision. Alphabetical subdivision should be employed
in a classification only after all logical and potentially useful possibil-
ities have been exhausted. Nevertheless, because it is a very close
classification, it can be (and apparently has been) used for a classi-
fied catalog. The classified catalogs of Boston University Library and
of the Music Division in the Library of Congress are both based on the
LC classification.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 7
</p>
<p>The Colon Classification of S.R. Ranganathan has been developed
expressly for the classified catalog, and is no doubt quite well suited
to its needs. However, the Colon Classification, as well as the Bliss
and other classifications, is all but unknown to practicing catalogers
in the United States. This is no criticism of the Colon classification,
but does mean that it is less likely to be adopted than if it were more
widely known.
</p>
<p>Another great disadvantage of the classified catalog is to be found
in the fact that apparently no authority file for one has ever been pub-
lished, in any language, in any country, for any classification. This
is probably the most severe obstacle of all to the progress of the clas-
sified catalog. In a practical sense, it means that whenever the cata-
loger decides to use a particular numerical subject heading for the first
time i e.g. 331 .81, he cannot turn to a printed authority file and find
there a statement of the most important cross-references that should
be put into his index in order to lead readers tothis number. Those of
us who are accustomed to the list of refer froms in the LC, Sears and
other lists need only imagine the difficulties and troubles that would
accompany the elimination of refer froms from those lists. It is a pity
that the funds that went into the publication of the arbitrary and some-
times ill-advised "manual" for a classified catalog published in Shera
and Egan's book on the classified catalog could not have been spent for
such an authority file, if not for a better manual .
</p>
<p>The published classification schemes are to the classified catalog
what the printed lists of standard subject headings (without refer
froms) are to the alphabetical subject catalog. There are two steps in
subject heading work: (1) selecting an appropriate heading, and (2)
helping the reader to find it. The printed classification schedules pre-
sently available provide guidance only for the first step. For the second
step, printed authority files are urgently needed for each classification
scheme that is to be used for a classified catalog. Until they are avail-
able, catalogers must inevitably spend unnecessary amounts of time
thinking up lists of terms needed for the index. In this effort, until
numerical authority files are provided, the cataloger will be helped
immeasurably by the cross-reference suggestions printed in such
authority files as the LC and Sears lists of subject headings (i.e. the
x and xx refer froms) .
</p>
<p>A fourth disadvantage of the classified catalog lies in the fact that
every subject heading must be classified the first time it is used. This
is particularly troublesome when a standard classification scheme is
being used and the classifier in a particular library cannot know where
those in charge of keeping the classification up to date will place a new
topic. Nevertheless, the new topic must be fitted into the classification
somewhere, and cross-references provided in the index. This problem
faces all libraries, of course, whether or not they have a classified
</p>
<p>catalog, for the books on these new topics must also be classified for

</p>
<p>the shelves. However, subdivision is not so important on the shelves
as it is in the classified catalog. The classifier has three main al-
ternatives: (1) to classify and index temporarily- -or permanently--
the new topic, (2) to classify the new topic in the same number with
an older related topic, providing a new index reference, or (3) filing
cards for the books themselves in the alphabetical index until such
time as a permanent class number is assigned. The latter solution
has the disadvantage of leaving the classified catalog an incomplete
representation of the general subject field of which the new topic is
a part.
</p>
<p>D . Methodology of the Classified Catalog
</p>
<p>Administratively, the heart of the classified catalog apparatus is
the behind-the-scenes authority file. This term is something of a
misnomer. The term authority file came into being because of the
function of such files -- particularly in the fields of author entry and
</p>
<p>subject heading work- -in recording the biographical and other sources
used as "authority 11 for choosing the form of entry finally decided upon
for the person or subject in question. In most libraries today, however,
authority files are kept for three different reasons, (1) as a record that
a certain name or subject is represented in the library's collection,
(2) as a record of the exact form of name used for this person or sub-
ject in the catalog, and (3) as a record of the cross-references placed
in the catalogs to guide readers to the form of name under which the
books are actually listed.
</p>
<p>The authority file for the classified catalog is thus a record (1)
that a certain subject is actually represented in the classified catalog,
(2) that a certain number is used as a subject heading under which the
books on that subject are listed, and (3) that certain cross-references
have been placed in the index to guide readers to the number under
which the books are listed. A sample card from the authority file for
a classified catalog is shown as Fig. 41-3. In some libraries, the
explanation of the numbers given in parentheses might be omitted.
Note the see also references (indicated by xx) referring from related
</p>
<p>subjects scattered by the Decimal classification. One of these see
also references is shown as Fig. 41-4.
</p>
<p>Because the classification does scatter some subjects, the index
card under HOURS OF LABOR might refer to two or more numbers,
e.g. Fig. 41-5. The record of the cross-references shown in Fig. 41-5
is divided between the authority card for 331 .81 and the authority card
for 331.41, of course.</p>

to More than One Class Number .
</p>
<p>It almost goes without saying that authority cards should be set
</p>
<p>up for each broad number comprised within any specific number,
whether the broader number has been actually used or not. Thus, if
the number 331.81 (Hours of labor) has been used, authority cards
should be established for 331.8, 331, 330, and 300, even though actual
entries have perhaps not been made under all of those specific num-
bers. The topics represented by those numbers are represented, in
part, at least by the book or books listed under 331.81, and the cross-
references are therefore needed in the subject index.
</p>
<p>Although most of the cross-references in the subject index will
refer directly to the classified catalog, the index will become glutted
if this practice is carried too far. Thus there will be many index
cards under LABOR, e.g. LABOR, LABOR-- BIBLIOGRAPHY , LABOR- -
HISTORY, LABOR, HOURS OF, LABOR BUREAUS, LABOR CAMPS,
LABOR CONTRACTS, LABOR COURTS, etc. To duplicate these
under synonyms for LABOR such as WORK, WORKERS, WORKING, and
LABORERS is not economical. Inevitably there will be cross-
references in the index that will refer to other parts of the index, as
shown in Fig. 41-6. A special authority file will be maintained for
such references. A sample card is shown as Fig. 41-7. This file will
be a relatively small one, of course. Even in the largest library it
would seem possible to hold it down to less th*n a thousand cards, if
desired. The question of cross-references is discussed more fully
in sefction E below .</p>

</p>
<p>In addition to these basic records, certain other devices are valu-
able in interpreting the resources of the classified catalog to the
</p>
<p>library's public. Among these devices are the following:
</p>
<p>(1) Clear i concise and conspicuous instructions in the technique
of using the classified catalog , particularly if the index comprises a
separate alphabet. If the index cards are filed into the author and title
</p>
<p>catalog, cross-references beginning with the same word as authors
1
</p>
<p>surnames or other headings should appear on raised visible guides in
the alphabetical catalog.
</p>
<p>(2) Visible guides in the classified catalog . Guides with visible
numerical headings will simplify and speed the task of finding desired
classification numbers.
</p>
<p>(3) Explanation of numerical headings in the classified catalog.
The guides for numerical headings in the classified catalog should carry
an explanation of the meaning of the numbers . While this is not necessary
for readers using headings referred to in the index, it becomes important
if the reader is to take advantage of the related numerical headings filed
before and after the heading referred to from the word used in the index.
The classified catalog at the John Crerar Library, for example, fails
to reveal much related material because the classification numbers are
not explained in the classified catalog. It is too much to expect the
reader to try to figure out the meaning of the numerical heading.
</p>
<p>Explanatory guides of this type are less necessary in a classified
</p>
<p>catalog newly converted from an alphabetical subject catalog, since the
bulk of the subject cards will still carry the old alphabetical headings
in addition to the numerical headings . The old subject headings will
serve as an explanation of the numerical ones. If the numerical headings
are explained on every card, the wording given after a single number
need not be the same on every card. For example, older cards for
books on home economics might carry the heading
</p>
<p>640 (Domestic science)
</p>
<p>while newer ones might be headed
</p>
<p>640 (Home economics)
</p>
<p>At some time in the future , the cards for new books might be given
the heading
</p>
<p>640 (Home-making)
</p>
<p>The explanatory part of the heading would be ignored in filing ,
of course . However failure to ignore it might result in a useful
chronological grouping of books; this method would present some prob-
lems, and is not recommended.
</p>
<p>These explanations are less necessary if a guide carrying the ex-
planatory phrase is placed at the beginning of every class.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 13
</p>
<p>If a guide is provided for every classification number, the class
number itself need not even be typed on each subject card, but may
be written near the bottom of each by the cataloger or typist, and
filed, on this basis, behind the guide for that number.
</p>
<p>(4) Summaries of the classification . Summaries of each class
and subclass should be placed on guides and filed at the beginning of
each class and subclass. This device may supplement or replace the
separate guides explaining the meaning of each number (referred to
above). In such a case, they should be conspicuously placed, and
should include, in succession, the complete classification scheme
employed in the classified catalog.
</p>
<p>E* Cross-References in the Classified Catalog
</p>
<p>Various writers have pointed to the fact that a classification some-
times scatters materials on the same broad subject, contrary to the
claim that "the classified catalog always brings all related materials
together.
</p>
<p>11 It is doubtful if any proponent of the classified catalog has
ever seriously made such a sweeping claim. It is obvious, for ex-
ample, that railroad engineering (625 in the Decimal classification),
railroad transportation (385), and the railroad industry (656) are
more widely scattered by the classified catalog than by the alpha-
betical subject catalog. Similar cases are innumerable, though they
undoubtedly form a small minority cf all cases. Actually these are
different subjects and it may be questioned whether there are readers
who would be interested in the various "scattered" aspects of such
broad topics as railroads.
</p>
<p>The subject index to the classified catalog takes care of this prob-
lem by listing on the index card for railroads (or on several cards,
if each aspect of a subject is listed on a separate index card) the
various numbers under which the reader may look.
</p>
<p>However, for those readers who are looking for materials scat-
tered by the classification and who may have bypassed the subject
index, or who may have arrived at a relevant section of the classified
catalog via a reference in the index to a broader or more general
number, duplicate references in the classified catalog itself will be
useful, as shown above in Fig. 41-4.
</p>
<p>Another type of reference useful in the classified catalog itself
would be a cross-reference from subject with form division to form
entry with subject subdivision, where the latter type of entry is used,
or vice versa. For example, if all bibliographies are entered under
"016", a cross-reference reading "625.016" (Bibliography of railway
engineering) see 016,625" is useful in the classified catalog, in addi-
tion to the index entry "Railroad engineering Bibliography, see
016.625."
</p>
<p>A third type of reference to be placed in the classified catalog
itself is the see also reference to coordinate subjects likely to be of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 14
</p>
<p>interest to the reader seeking material on a given subject, referred
to earlier. This type of reference does not customarily appear in
classified catalogs or their indexes. However, addition of such see
also references to classified catalogs will benefit users to the same
cTegree that their provision benefits users of alphabetical subject
catalogs. An example of such a reference is FOLKLORE, see also
MYTHOLOGY. In this case, Mythology is not a subtopic of the class
Folklore, and is placed by the Decimal Classification, for example,
under an entirely different number, 290, whereas Folklore is given
the number 398. Here the classification does not automatically refer
the reader from FOLKLORE to MYTHOLOGY, and a cross-reference
is necessary if the catalog is to suggest this related topic to him.
</p>
<p>It may arbitrarily be suggested that perhaps three -fourths of the
see also references in a typical subject authority file are of the type
taken care of by the classification, i.e. references that are not needed
because the topics are classed side by side. It may be suggested that
a great many of the remaining references (those to coordinate subjects)
are of dubious value as found in the Library of Congress or Sears lists
of subject headings, e.g. , ETHICS, see also SUNDAY . However, a
great many others are undoubtedly of great value .
</p>
<p>Useful see also references to coordinate material may be located
in either the subject index or in the classified catalog itself. Whereas
in the alphabetical subject catalog see references refer to the actual
</p>
<p>heading where the see also references are given, in the subject index
to the classified catalog all cross-references generally refer directly
to the proper number in the classified catalog itself, so that if see
also references are to be placed in the index, either (1) they must be
duplicated under all synonymous terms, or (2) reference must be
made from synonymous terms to a "central11 index entry, where the
see also references will be given. The latter alternative is to be
preferred only if the see also references are very numerous .
RAILWAYS, see RAILROADS in the index saves repeating all the
subdivided, inverted and phrase entries under both words. However,
it is simpler to put most see also references into the classified catalog
itself as shown.' in Fig . 41-4.
</p>
<p>F. Form Headings in the Classified Catalog
</p>
<p>Another device for improving the performance of the classified
catalog is the use of form headings or entries. Such entries as
BIBLIOGRAPHIES, LAWS, STATISTICS, DIRECTORIES, STANDARDS,
HANDBOOKS, listed in the classified catalog under their numerical
equivalents and subarranged by the whole classification fperform a
unique service not possible in an alphabetical subject catalog. Thus,
in a Dewey Decimal classified catalog, we may find the following
entries:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

<p>Spangenberg. Vacuum
Tubes
</p>
<p>While various other subtopics of each broader topic are scattered
among the above entries! the reader compiling a bibliography of
vacuum tubes may conveniently locate all the general bibliographies
that include his special subject merely by starting with its detailed
number (016.621384132) and successively dropping digits in order to
locate additional bibliographies of each broader topic. It is obvious
that the best or most up-to-date bibliographies of vacuum tubes are to
be found under such headings as 016.62 or 016.62138 in the classified
catalog, or ENGINEERING-BIBLIOGRAPHY or ELECTRONICS--
BIBLIOGRAPHY in the alphabetical subject catalog, and not necessarily
under the most specific headings (016.621384132 or "VACUUM TUBES-
BIBLIOGRAPHY 11 ) in either kind of catalog, since the general biblio-
graphies are apt to be much more up to date than the specialized ones.
</p>
<p>Thus the "relating 11 feature of the classified catalog reaches its
peak of usefulness in the form entry. Statistics of the Mormon church
are revealed in a volume containing statistics of the broader topic
"Christian churches," under the number (0003)28, although the reader
looks first for (0003)289.3 (Statistics of the Mormon church), and find-
ing nothing, cuts back the number until he finds (0003)28, (Statistics
of Christian churches). 3 The handbook (02) of broad scope covering a
topic where no specialized handbook exists can be quickly located by
this method. The directory (058) that would list an organization in
a limited subject area (for which no specialized directory exists)
can be found.
</p>
<p>The H.W. Wilson Company was guided, at least in part, by this
reasoning when it offered, several years ago, to publish the Biblio-
graphic Index according to a classified arrangement instead of an
alphabetical one . The proposal was voted down by subscribers.
</p>
<p>Form entries are set off by parentheses in the Engineering So-
cieties Library, New York, as provided in the Universal Decimal
Classification, and may be taken from or based on Table I, p. 1880-3,
in the 14th edition of the Decimal Classification.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 16
</p>
<p>This type of service cannot be performed by the alphabetical sub-
ject catalog. That catalog may provide direct entry under form head-
ings, but unfortunately subdivision of such headings must be undertaken
alphabetically instead of logically (by the whole classification). Once
alphabetical subarrangement is provided, the whole raison d'etre of
the form heading collapses, for related bibliographies are no longer
listed together, e.g. , collections of laws in related and broader sub-
ject areas are hopelessly scattered.
</p>
<p>When the form entry is used in the classified catalog, it may be
either a duplicate entry, e.g. identical cards under (016)42 and 420.16,
or else entry under subject may be omitted, e.g. "420.16, see
(016)42".
</p>
<p>The use of the form heading in classified catalogs offers a service
that has no parallel in the alphabetical subject catalog.
</p>
<p>In a classified catalog arranged by the LC classification, certain
form entries provided in the classification should be avoided, as these
are subdivided alphabetically rather than by the whole classification.
A form entry subdivided by the whole L.C classification may be sub-
stituted in each such case.
</p>
<p>G. Geographic Subdivision and Entry in the
Classified Catalog
</p>
<p>Except when arranged by the LC classification or other classifica-
tions that generally provide alphabetical arrangement of political units,
most classified catalogs will provide extremely useful geographic sub-
arrangements. This feature of classified catalogs makes it possible to
bring together under each subject for which geographic subdivision is
provided all the material in the library pertaining to any broad, medium-
sized or other geographic unit. At the same time entry for and approach
to the most minute political subdivisions are provided. It becomes pos-
sible for the reader to start his search under any subject with the most
specific political subdivision in which he is interested. He may then
find, adjacent, material treating the same subject in the broader or
smaller geographic or political units comprehending or subordinated
to that of his specialized interest. This feature provides all the fruits
of LiC's so-called "indirect geographic subdivision 11 (and more) as well
as all the benefits of Mdirect" subdivision. It makes attractive even so
bold a prospect as duplicate entry both under subject and under geo-
graphic units (each subdivided by the other).
</p>
<p>4 Thus, the classified
catalog subdivides the subject ART geographically, as:
</p>
<p>4 In any case, the classified catalog avoids the dilemma of the
alphabetical subject catalog in that, unless entry is duplicated under
geographic units, subjects are always subdivided geographically. It
would be repetitive to quote here the lamentations of the many writers
who have been unable to follow the reasoning that guided the makers of
the standard subject heading lists in deciding to subdivide some sub-
jects geographically and to enter other subjects as subdivisions under
place-names.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 17
</p>
<p>Number Subject Heading
</p>
<p>709.73 ART-U.S.
709.75 ART SOUTHEASTERN STATES
709.759 ART FLORIDA
709.75938 ART DADE COUNTY, FLA.
709.759381 ART-MIAMI, FLA.
</p>
<p>The equivalent alphabetical subject headings from the LC list are
shown at the right of their numerical equivalents. In a small library,
the classified catalog would reveal in one place the small but complete
holdings of the library on art in Florida. The alphabetical subject
catalog would require the reader to look under the name of every county
and city in the state as subdivisions of the heading ART, since the names
of the cities and counties would be mixed up in one alphabet with the
names of all other cities, counties, states, provinces, countries, re-
gions, etc . , in the whole world. This makes a major operation out of
finding the material on art in the state of Florida in a dictionary catalog,
however scant the library's holdings might be in this subject area.
</p>
<p>Thus we see that the classified catalog provides a superior method
of geographic subdivision.
</p>
<p>With the addition or use of the devices described in this section,
the classified catalog can become a tool with startling powers of revela-
tion.
</p>
<p>H. Close Classification
</p>
<p>Close classification is a device that simplifies the search for the
</p>
<p>right book. The classified catalog permits the reader to have the ad-
vantages of both broad and close classification, since a succession of
</p>
<p>closely classified cards comprises a broad classification. This point
will be developed later. Close classification would also solve the prob-
lem created by the inclusion of a large number of books on a specific
subject under the number for a broad heading. This problem was cited
by Grace Kelley in her paper on the classified catalog in the John
Crerar Library. She used as an example the practice of entering
works on Gestalt psychology under 150.1, theory of psychology, neces-
sitating, as a solution of the problem of the reader's having to wade
through hundreds of cards under that number in order to find the few
dealing with Gestalt psychology, the use of a "collect" guide in the
index to the classified catalog, under "Gestalt psychology", behind
which duplicate cards for that subject were collected. This technique
was extensively used in the classed catalog at the John Crerar Library,
where it created an almost intolerable situation, and did much to under-
mine faith in the classed catalog there. The practice has been abandoned
recently, and faith has apparently been restored. This problem can, of
course, be solved in another way, and without duplicating entries, by
applying the principle of close classification to the cards under 150.1,
in order to provide a separate number (presumably a subdivision of
150.1) for Gestalt psychology, with a specific reference to the new
number from the words "Gestalt psychology" in the index. After this</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 18
</p>
<p>change had been made, the advantages of close classification would be
obtained. Yet, at the same time, the number of cards under numeri-
cal headings beginning with 150.1 would be neither increased nor de-
creased, even by one card, so that the advantages of broad classifica-
tion would also be obtained.
</p>
<p>Entries in the index should preferably never refer to a number
that includes other clearly definable subjects. It almost goes without
</p>
<p>saying that broad classification may be retained for actual call num-
bers, even though the cards in the catalog may all be closely classified.
Yet, during the entire period (over fifty years) in which the John
Crerar Library used the Decimal classification for its books, classi-
fication policy provided that the exact number used for the call number
should be used for at least one numerical entry in the classified catalog.
This policy resulted in excessively long call numbers for the books and
periodicals, and also explains why the classifiers were reluctant to
subdivide "over-full" numbers in the classified catalog, since closer
classification in the classified catalog would mean still longer numbers
on the books. The classifiers solved this problem in part by providing
"collect11 guides in the subject index for some of the subdivisions of
topics they were reluctant to subdivide numerically.
</p>
<p>I. The Classified Catalog in the Small Library
</p>
<p>Classified catalogs are potentially of even greater utility in a
small library than in a large library. In a small library, books will
not be found on every minute topic for which a subject heading exists
either in the catalogers
</p>
<p>1 list or in the reader's mind. Thus the reader
may be more frequently forced to turn to general books for material
on a specific subject, or to a variety of specific subjects to collect an
adequate amount of material on a given general subject. The reader
who finds very little material listed on his special topic in the alpha-
betical subject catalog will also find very little listed under its
numerical counterpart in the classified catalog of the same library.
In the classified catalog, however, he will find additional material on
a broader or related topic or on a group of more specific topics, all
adjacent to the place where he looked for the given topic . This happy
fact results from the nature of the classified catalog, and has been
referred to earlier as the "relating" feature of the classified catalog.
It is accomplished with fewer actual cross-references (including those
in the subject index) than are required to give even minimum service
with the alphabetical subject catalog.
</p>
<p>As an example, let us take the reader in a small library who is
writing a paper on contemporary architecture for public buildings.
In a large library, he is likely to find an ample amount of material
under the headings PUBLIC BUILDINGS and U.S.-PUBLIC BUILD-
INGS. In a small library, these headings may very likely be inade-
quately productive, with only one or two books, or even none at all,
to be found under either heading. Therefore additional material
would have to be obtained from a few somewhat more specialized books
in this general subject area. Of the many specialized books in this field,
the small library is likely to possess only a few. However, they would</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41- 19
</p>
<p>have to be searched for by our reader under a variety of specialized
headings, such as WASHINGTON, D.Cr-PUBLIC BUILDINGS,
CALIFORNIA-PUBLIC BUILDINGS, COURT-HOUSES, RAILROAD-
STATIONS, LIBRARY ARCHITECTURE, OFFICE BUILDINGS,
CHICAGO-OFFICE BUILDINGS, MOTOR BUS LINES-STATIONS,
HOSPITALS-CONSTRUCTION, OREGON-CAPITAL AND CAPITOL,
PRISONS-CONSTRUCTION, AUDITORIUMS, etc., endlessly. I do not
mean to imply that material would actually be found in a small library
under all these headings. Indeed, material would be found under only
a very few of them. But the reader's need for these materials would
increase in direct proportion to the smallness of the library, and the
smaller the library the more headings he would have to use in order to
find an adequate amount of material for his paper. There is an inverse
relationship between size of library and the number of headings under
which readers have to look. No matter how few of the headings given
above actually appear in the card catalog, the reader will have to look
up each one in order to be sure the material is not listed there. Indeed,
he will have to do more than look up the examples given. He will also
have to take additional steps.
</p>
<p>(1) He must look up the names of all the different types of buildings
that exist.
</p>
<p>(2) He must look up, where the heading does not appear in the
catalog, not only the heading in the form given by Sears or LC , but all
possible alternatives to those forms, since he has no way of knowing
which form would have been used. For example, imagine the variety
of headings a reader would have to look up in a small library that did
not own material on the education of exceptional children. In the large
library, he is directed after one or two tries to the proper heading (I
leave its actual identity to your imagination) . In the small library
that does not own any material on the subject, there being no cross-
references to headings not used, he would have to look under great
varieties of words, e.g. Children, Exceptional; Blind; Deaf; Abnormal;
Abnormalities; Bright; Intelligent; Intelligence; Handicapped; Backward;
Crippled; Education; Educational; Mental; Mentally; Mentality; Retard-
ed; etc.; etc. After tiring of this search he still would not be sure he
had not overlooked some legitimate and extant heading.
</p>
<p>(3) He must look up all the geographic possibilities, at least
theoretically including all the cities, states and counties in the United
States, and for all practical purposes including all the states, major
cities in the United States, and all the counties and minor cities of his
home state.
</p>
<p>(4) He must look through, under each geographic heading, the
relevant subdivision, e.g. Office buildings, Public buildings, etc. , or
else go through the entire file of cards under all the individual geo-
graphic and political entities in the United States (which would probably
be easier) .
</p>
<p>One would think all this search could be avoided by the use of
cross-references to materials owned by the library, and that in the
absence of a cross-reference, it could be assumed by our reader that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 20
</p>
<p>no material existed. Unfortunately, these headings are not connected
</p>
<p>by cross-references in the LC and Sears lists. Not even the so-called
"general 11 type of reference ("see also names of particular types of
public buildings
</p>
<p>11
) is used in either list. Even if it were used, it would
</p>
<p>not limit the possibilities. Perhaps it is better that it isn't used, since
it would only serve to discourage the reader in a small library. Haykin
says, "In a small library, where the number of specific headings in the
catalog is small, it is obviously unnecessary to use general refer-
ences. If 5 However, this piece of advice does not serve to get the
general reference out of the LC list, which is used in many small
libraries, especially branch public libraries, nor is it likely to get
the editors of the Sears list to drop the general reference, nor is it
likely to cause any stampede by the catalogers in small libraries to
replace general references by specific lists. Nor, even if the cata-
logers did suddenly replace general references by specific lists of
</p>
<p>headings which should also be seen, would it reassure readers that
there were no books on sparrows in the library just because they found
the reference BIRDS, see also ORIOLES. The reader would have to
look under SPARROWS and ENGLISH SPARROWS to be convinced.
</p>
<p>Actually, the detailed headings given above as examples of differ-
ent types of public buildings are used only in the LC list, and not in
Sears. Theoretically, our reader does not have to look under RAIL-
ROADS-STATIONS in a library using the Sears list, because if that
library had a book on railroad stations it would be entered under
PUBLIC BUILDINGS (I guess). But if the library doesn't have such a
book, and if the reader does not find it under PUBLIC BUILDINGS- -
as he surely would not -- won't he have to look under RAILROAD
STATIONS (and RAILROADS-STATIONS) just the same? How should
he know that those headings would not be used even if the library did
have books on this subject? In other words, it does not matter that
the user of Sears violated the dictionary catalog principle of specific
entry; in a small library, the reader must look under the specific
entries all the same. What, then, besides a saving in printing costs,
has been gained by eliminating all the highly specialized subject head-
ings from the Sears list?
</p>
<p>Incidentally, if the small library using the Sears list does have a
book on railroad stations, and enters it under PUBLIC BUILDINGS,
I hope an exception can be made to the dictionary catalog rule that
cross-references are never made from the specific to the general,
because if I were looking for a book on railroad stations, it would
never occur to me to look under anything but "stations, 11 "depots/ 1
"railroad stations, 11 "terminals," and a few other terms that do not
appear in the Sears list.
</p>
<p>Assuming that the alphabetical subject catalog approach just
described leaves something to be desired, we may console ourselves
that in most small libraries the reader may go directly to the shelves.
However, the shelves are a poor substitute for the card catalog in
</p>
<p>Haykin, op . cit . , p. 55. He might well have substituted the term
"undesirable" for "unnecessary."</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 21
</p>
<p>that (1) the shelves represent only a fraction of the subject headings in
the card catalog , (2) some of the books may be in circulation, and (3)
certain classes of books (oversize books, rare books, etc.) are usually
out of sequence .
</p>
<p>It is perhaps needless to say that the books on architecture of public
buildings in a small library having a classed catalog using the Decimal
Classification are all listed under 725 and its subdivisions, with refer-
ences in the subject index (directed to specific subdivisions) from the
names of each type of building and each geographical location. In other
words, the classified catalog lists everything on a broad subject in one
place, but simultaneously provides in the index a direct reference to any
minutely specific topic. With a classified catalog, you have your cake
and you eat it too.
</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the success of the dictionary catalog depends so
largely on an adequate network of cross-references . Not only are the
standard subject heading lists lacking in the number of references re-
quired, but individual catalogs in small American libraries are "defect-
ive, to say the least, "6 in that they do not regularly and uniformly con-
tain references from place subdivided by subject, nor do they even
uniformly and regularly provide the specific cross-references actually
prescribed by the standard lists, let alone undertake such extravagances
as the replacement of general references by lists of specific ones. What
is worse , most of them are bound by a tradition that provides that see
also references are to be made only in cases where the subject heading
referred from is actually used,? as though the reader who finds nothing
on the subject under which he first looks would therefore not be inter-
ested in related materials, but if the reader does find something under
the subject under which he first looks, then we should supply him with
a list of related subjects! It would be more logical if it were the other
way around.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest weakness of the dictionary catalog is that one
can never be sure of what one has missed. In the classed catalog, it
is fairly easy to determine that the library does NOT have materials
in a certain area or to determine the total amount of material it does
have in any particular area.
</p>
<p>If our alphabetical subject catalogs do not contain the bare minimum
number of cross-references required by the standard subject heading
lists, and if the lists themselves do not contain an adequate number of
cross-references to support simple subject materials searches in the
small library, it is perhaps time we cast our eyes in the direction
of the self-cross-referencing classified catalog. It is also appropriate
to do so in that the classified catalog promises a saving in cataloging
costs, while the provision of an elaborate network of references for the
alphabetical subject catalog of the small library would mean an increase
in cost.

<p>Those who argue against the classified catalog for the small library
do so mainly on the ground that it would be "confusing" for our readers,
who might never learn to use it. Some of these critics do not realize
how eternally "confusing" the alphabetical subject catalog is, no matter
how well we learn to use it. The arrangement and method of use of the
classified catalog can be made almost as simple as the classified ar-
rangement of the books on the shelves of small libraries has been made
to appear. The principles and techniques are the same, and the benefits
</p>
<p>might be as great.
</p>
<p>J . History of the Classified Catalog in the
United States
</p>
<p>At the present time, there are relatively few classified catalogs in
the United States. Popular opinion among librarians in the United States
has it that there used to be a great many more than there are now, and
that they have gradually been abandoned. A history of American classi-
fied catalogs needs to be written, and such a history might verify the
thesis that the classed catalog is on the way out. However, a number
of classified catalogs have been established in recent years:
</p>
<p>John Crerar Library, Chicago 1895
American Museum of Natural History,
</p>
<p>New York 1903
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh 1907
Engineering Societies Library, New York 1919
General Mills Corporation, Minneapolis 1942
Library of Congress, Music Division 1943
Boston University Library 1948
</p>
<p>The classified catalogs that have been abandoned were based largely
on non-standard classification schemes that were not kept up to date. It
is the writer's belief that the principal reasons for the decline of the
classified catalog in this country in the latter part of the nineteenth
</p>
<p>century and the early part of the twentieth include
</p>
<p>(1) the weakness of the classification schemes employed
</p>
<p>(2) the novelty and superficial superiority of the dictionary
catalog
</p>
<p>(3) the widespread adoption of LC cards, which failed to
provide class numbers for libraries with classified
catalogs, and
</p>
<p>(4) the lack of objective and proper means of evaluating the
alphabetical subject heading system employed by the
Library of Congress and the Sears list, and the almost
complete failure of librarians to do anything about pub-
lished criticisms, even in recent years.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>41 - 23
</p>
<p>That there may be a resurgence of the classified catalog IB, however,
a hope for which little evidence of fulfillment is presently in sight.

<p>CHAPTER 42
</p>
<p>Precataloging For Small and Medium-Sized Libraries
</p>
<p>The librarian responsible for cataloging in the small library is
usually torn between the conflicting ideals of maximum service and
maximum economy.
</p>
<p>The chief measures of the service provided by the cataloger are
both qualitative and quantitative. The quality and quantity of his cata-
loging soon become known to the other members of the staff -- and even
to the public. To undertake original, or local, cataloging of high quality
is to cut down on quantity* so that most catalogers buy Wilson or Library
of Congress cards whenever possible in order to catalog as many books
as possible in the time available. The high standards of cataloging em-
ployed by these two makers of printed cards ensure quality of cataloging,
especially if the cataloger efficiently exercises his judgment in applying
the added entries, subject entries and classification numbers suggested
on the cards. If occasionally a printed card carrying an ill- chosen sub-
ject heading or class number is employed, the cataloger may take refuge
in the fact that it was not his idea. Thus we see that, superficially at
least, the use of printed cards guarantees certain minimum standards of
quality, and, to the extent that they are available, permits the cataloger
to process a maximum quantity of books.
</p>
<p>The chief measure of quantity, in most libraries, is the size of
the backlog in the catalog department. Besides its visible proportions,
the backlog makes itself known in other ways, especially if it is a
siceable one. Other members of the staff look through it for new books
not listed in the catalog, whether they are in the backlog or not. Mem-
bers of the reading public denounce the library for not buying books
promptly. In colleges, teachers sometimes blame the order librarian
or the head librarian for ignoring their requests. Until they are cata-
loged, books for which the library has paid do not earn their cost in
terms of circulation. In addition, they are rapidly depreciating in
value. Catalogers who are aware of the damaging effects of a catalog-
ing backlog on their reputations and on the reputation of the library are
interested in eliminating the backlog.
</p>
<p>If the backlog consists, however, of books that are waiting for
printed cards, its elimination calls for some sacrifices in economy.
The chief measure of economy is quantitative, i.e. the number of
titles processed (in accordance with desired standards) in a given
amount of time. This measure explains why the use of printed cards
is generally economical. Since they simplify the work that must be
done for each title, we can catalog more titles in the same amount of
time. Therefore, if we try to eliminate the backlog by not waiting for
printed cards, we must either increase the amount of time devoted to
cataloging, which could hardly be described as an economy move, or
lower the quality of the cataloging. The latter alternative is desirable
</p>
<p>42 - 1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>42 - 2
</p>
<p>only if the established cataloging standards are excessively high.
</p>
<p>Publication of the Library of Congress Rules for Descriptive
Cataloging in 1949 enabled catalogers everywhere to bring about
certain desirable reductions in cataloging standards. While certain
random economies may still be achieved here and there by individual
catalogers, it is doubtful that further substantial economies in local
</p>
<p>cataloging can be achieved as long as local cataloging must harmonise
with cards printed by the Wilson Company and the Library of Congress.
Certainly, further economies must come largely in the areas of author
entry, subject heading and classification work. The field of descrip-
tive cataloging has had about all the cuts it can stand if we are still
expecting to supply the reader with enough information to make an
intelligent choice of books while standing at the card catalog. We can-
not do much more simplification and still prepare cards in accordance
with current cataloging aids.
</p>
<p>1 Until these basic aids are simplified,
printed cards will not be further simplified. Until printed cards are
</p>
<p>simplified, catalog cards prepared locally on a fundamentally simpler
basis cannot be effectively used. Simplification by elimination of
certain parts of the cataloging process can be effective in reducing
the backlog, but it is a technique that deprives the reader of all or
</p>
<p>part of the name or subject approach. Such simplification techniques
include omission of one or more of the following processes or of parts
of these processes: (1) subject headings, (2) subject classification
</p>
<p>(in favor of use of some sort of serial numbering system), (3) author
entry, and (4) information on the card not essential to distinguishing
one edition from another. Such short cuts are likely to have the dis-
advantage of depriving some readers of an approach to books they are
seeking.
</p>
<p>How, then, can cataloging backlogs be eliminated economically?
The Fall 1951 issue of the Journal of Cataloging and Classification was
devoted to the cataloging of arrearages at several large libraries, and
may be read with profit. Other libraries 1 experiences have been
described from time to time in the literature. Still other libraries
have devised schemes to eliminate backlogs, but have not taken the
time to publish procedural accounts.
</p>
<p>All such schemes may be fitted into one of the following groups:
</p>
<p>(1) assignment of extra help
(2) weeding and discarding part of the backlog
(3) shortening the period of waiting for printed cards
(4) simplification or elimination of part of the cataloging
</p>
<p>process
(5) temporary cataloging

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>42 - 3
</p>
<p>Of these methods, the fifth is the only one to give promise of
maintaining standards of quality without sacrificing economy, as the
</p>
<p>cataloger can afford to wait almost indefinitely for printed cards if a
</p>
<p>temporary card is in the catalog. As an emergency measure, weed-
ing and discarding part of the backlog is to be deplored, since weeding
and discarding should be based on the utility of the material as weighed
against the cheapest possible cataloging cost.
</p>
<p>Temporary cataloging may be considered an effective treatment
for backlogs only if the cost of the temporary cataloging is substan-
tially less than the cost of preparing permanent cards locally, as
against waiting for printed cards, or unless the improved (faster)
service provided is deemed worth the cost of the temporary cataloging.
</p>
<p>If temporary cataloging is to be employed as the remedy for cata-
loging backlogs, it should be applied (1) as early in the process as
possible (in order to secure maximum benefits) and (2) as inexpen-
sively as possible. The writer has previously suggested that tempor-
ary cataloging is least expensive when applied in routine fashion to all
titles at the time orders are placed rather than when the books are
received. At that time, it was suggested that temporary cataloging
systems applied to books at ordering time be called "precataloging."
The term and the practice appear to have gained some acceptance.
The advantages of precataloging may be summarized as follows:
</p>
<p>(1) All books can be located immediately via the card catalog.
(2) Readers are automatically told that a book is on order rather
</p>
<p>than being left to wonder if the library will place an order.
(3) Order suggestions for books already on order are eliminated.
(4) The order librarian finds listed in the card catalog all books
</p>
<p>that are in the library or on order, and therefore needs to
search new orders in no other place.
</p>
<p>(5) The "received but not cataloged", or "in-process 11 , file can
be eliminated.
</p>
<p>(6) Uncataloged books can be circulated by the circulation librarian.
</p>
<p>(7) Cataloger s may wait as long as necessary for printed cards,
since books are available.
</p>
<p>(8) Uncataloged books can be circulated for as long a period as
</p>
<p>cataloged books, and under the same regulations.
(9) Filing of the temporary card in the catalog provides a second
</p>
<p>check on the accuracy of the searching done by the order li-
brarian, and fewer duplicates are ordered.
</p>
<p>Precataloged records consist basically of the following: (1) an
order slip for printed cards, (2) a record of the book order in an
</p>
<p>"outstanding orders 11 file, (3) a record of volumes received but not
</p>
<p>cataloged, (4) a temporary card in the public catalog, and (5) a
serial number by which the books may be temporarily shelved while
waiting for printed cards and cataloging .
</p>
<p>"Precataloging - a Must for the Modern Library, 11 College and
Research Libraries 10:221-6, July 1949, pt. 1, p. 221-226.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>42-4
</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of these basic records already exist in most
small libraries. These libraries prepare a slip (or other form)
for ordering printed cards v they keep a card record (on an tforder
card") of outstanding orders, and they record receipt somewhere in
the order office , often in an accession book, otherwise in an "in-
process" file or (finally) in the card catalog. Some libraries keep a
duplicate copy on a blank slip or card of the Library of Congress card
order. If the library decides to use a precataloging system, this slip
may be filed in the public catalog .
</p>
<p>The fifth record, a serial number, is not a record in itself, but
is written* stamped or typed on all of the other four records . If the
library uses accession numbers, these may be assigned in advance of
ordering. In the case of titles not received, the accession numbers
(which may be called order numbers, or order-accession numbers)
may be assigned to another title, or, better, cancelled. In any case,
a separate number should be assigned to each title, except that added
copies and volumes should be exempted from the precataloging system.
Works in two volumes or copies should be assigned the same number,
with "A" and "B" or similar suffixes.
</p>
<p>The books can be shelved and circulated as soon as they arrive.
The order-accession number (which would appear on the temporary
catalog card in call number position) may be used as a call number
until the printed cards are received. These books can be placed
under the jurisdiction of the circulation staff as soon as they have been
stamped and pocketed. The permanent call numbers can be added to
the bookcards later. This procedure will relieve the cataloger of
responsibility for a collection of uncataloged books. He can call for
the books as soon as the printed cards have come and he has time for
them. If they are out on loan, he can wait until they come back. After
all, the purpose of cataloging is circulation, and if it can be accom-
plished without cataloging, so much the better. The temporary card
in the catalog need not say that the book is only on order. If the book
card is also made at time of ordering, and can be stamped "Not Re-
ceived" as the first charge, it may be filed in the circulation file by
order-accession number, although this is certainly not a necessary
part of the precataloging process. Patrons who call for the book will
accept gracefully the statement that it has not yet been received.
Discharge from the "Not Received 11 status is automatic; after the
books are pocketed, they are "discharged", and shelved by order
number. At the time of pocketing, a clerk can apply to the spines a
label showing the order-accession number, or a slip bearing this
number may be allowed to project from the top edge of the book; this
will be removed when the book is permanently classified. If book
cards are not used by the library, whatever type of charge record is
used can be prepared as a record in the circulation department of
books not yet received, or this record may be omitted altogether. In
the latter case, the circuation assistants would consult whatever re-
cord of receipt is maintained whenever asked by readers to supply a
book by order-accession number.
</p>
<p>After the books have been classified and sent to the stacks under
their permanent call numbers, there may be a brief period during
which the temporary card remains in the catalog before being replaced</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>42 - 5
</p>
<p>by the permanent card showing the permanent call number. To en-
able the circulation assistant to determine the call number super-
seding each accession number, the call numbers may be written in
the accession book as promptly after .classifying as possible. Or the
call number may be written on the LC order slips or some other re-
cord that can be filed by accession number to serve as an index to the
call numbers. If the permanent catalog cards are filed promptly, such
a record is not needed, of course.
</p>
<p>Books for which no printed cards have been received can be circu-
lated indefinitely on their temporary numbers. This system permits
the Library to ask the Library of Congress to hold orders as long as
necessary to obtain the cards instead of for a relatively short period.
Of the books for which LC states there is no prospect of obtaining
cards, careful examination by a professional librarian will reveal that
a certain percentage are of insufficient value to warrant more than the
temporary cataloging they were given at the time of ordering, so that
the temporary cards may be considered permanent if the books are to
be kept. It will become apparent that some of the other books can be
discarded. The librarian will observe that certain errors on some of
the LC order slips can be corrected, and that LC cards can be obtained
after all. Other books will require subject catalog cards prepared
locally; much of the work of cataloging and classifying these books can
be done by a typist if closely supervised, and there will be an extremely
small number in this category if a reasonable amount of time (say a
year in the case of most titles) has been allowed the Library of Congress
to print cards. The Library of Congress, for various valid reasons,
often checks orders MNp fl (No prospect) shortly after publication, but
within months obtains copies of the books and prints cards for them
after aU.
</p>
<p>Second-hand orders are sometimes exempted from precataloging
systems because the books are often sold. Order librarians rightly
feel that elaborate records need not be set up for books that are pos-
sibly not going to be received. One of the simplest solutions in such
cases is not to order second-hand books until they have been reserved
for the library. Letters of reservation not only eliminate the neces-
</p>
<p>sity for preparing elaborate precataloging and ordering records for
books that are sold, but they may be prepared more easily and sent
out more quickly than formal order forms in many cases. A sample
letter of reservation is shown on the next page.
</p>
<p>It goes without saying that additional economies may be obtained
by preparing the printed-card order slip and the temporary catalog
card in a single operation, and larger libraries wishing to produce
additional auxiliary records from the same typing operation, e.g.
purchase-order slips, dealers 1 return slips, financial record slips,
claim slips, etc., may effect further economies by turning to pre-
fabricated multiple -carbon- interleaved forms. However, the two
simple forms described here should provide any small library with
an effective, inexpensive and easy- to- install system for providing
maximum service to readers at minimum cost with maximum speed.</p>

<p>Precataloging involves cooperation between order librarian and
cataloger. The order librarian prepares the precataloging records,
turning the printed-card order slip over to the cataloger, who sends
it to the Wilson Company or to the Library of Congress. The order
librarian seeks to use an author entry that will harmonize with the
entries already in the catalog, and should pass along to the cataloger
any information found as a by-product of the order -searching process ,
that will be useful to the cataloger. On the other hand, the order li-
brarian need not, and should not, search for information that will be
useful to the cataloger unless such information is essential to the
ordering process. The order librarian does not make the final deci-
sion as to whether a book shall be cataloged under editor, society
responsible for publication, or title; indeed, if the temporary card is
filed by the order librarian under editor, and the cataloger, when the
book is received, observes that it will eventually be cataloged under
title (when printed cards are used), the temporary entry need not be
corrected, since it will be removed by the added entry for editor that

<p>The order librarian should not shy away from precataloging merely
because it involves establishment of temporary catalog entries. After
all, if the order librarian is not competent to write a catalog entry
down on an order card, he is not to be trusted with ordering books, for
"searching" to see if books are already in the library implies a know-
ledge of the cataloging rules for author and title entry. The order</p>

</p>
<p>librarian who does not know these principles should turn over to the
cataloger his searching duties, whether or not a precataloging sys-
tem is used.
</p>
<p>In any case, close cooperation is called for if a precataloging
system is to be installed. This cooperation will bring to the library
many auxiliary benefits .

<p>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION IN CLASS
</p>
<p>Which record could be used to convey the call number to the
accession book during the period in which the book has been classi-
fied but permanent cards have not yet been filed in the public catalog?
</p>
<p>If the library does not keep a file of "duplicate" printed-card
order slips, how can the cataloger tell whether or not printed cards
have been ordered?
</p>
<p>If a new pseudonymously- written book is to be ordered, and the
library has no other books by that author, when should the cross-
reference be made?
</p>
<p>Are changes on the temporary card necessary if an edition differ-
ent from that ordered is received, or can such changes wait until the
book is cataloged permanently?</p>

<p>Music Literature and Music Terminology
</p>
<p>The shortening of the work-week, providing leisure, and the develop-
ment of phonographs , records, the radio, television and other devices
for bringing music to the American home have resulted in a rapid in-
crease in the number of persons interested in music in recent years.
The introduction of the long-playing record revolutionized the phono-
graph record industry within a few short months in 1948. This de-
velopment provided public libraries with both the opportunity and
demand for augmented service in this field. There is reason to believe
that public and other libraries everywhere will attempt to meet this
challenge by increasing the sixe of their collections in the field of music .
</p>
<p>A. Types of Music Materials
</p>
<p>Libraries may collect any of three distinctly different types of
music materials:
</p>
<p>1) Music literature (books and pamphlets about music)
2) Music scores (printed or manuscript copies of musical
</p>
<p>compositions)
3) Musical recordings (sound recordings of actual musical
</p>
<p>performances).
</p>
<p>These three types of musical materials are generally segregated
in libraries .
</p>
<p>B. Classification of Music Materials
</p>
<p>The two major classifications -- Decimal and Library of Congress
used in American libraries provide for separating physically these three
types of materials. The Decimal Classification provides a classification
only for the literature of music, but music librarians have long been ac-
customed to prefixing the letter "M" (for music) to the class numbers and
applying the result to scores. The same principle, using an "R" or
other symbols has been applied to records by many librarians. Librettos
may be treated similarly . Thus:
</p>
<p>786.4 Piano music today
M786.4 Chopin. Etudes, op. 25 (score)
R786.4 Chopin. Etudes, op. 25 (phonograph record)
</p>
<p>The 14th edition of the Decimal Classification contained an expan-
sion of its original tables for music that was adequate for a collection
of scores and records. In the 15th edition this was drastically abbre-
</p>
<p>43 - 1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>43-2
</p>
<p>viated so that orderly arrangement of scores and records in certain
classes becomes difficult, e.g. distinction between trios and quartets.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress classification, adhering to a policy of
avoiding mnemonic devices, does not employ the simple device of the
Dewey classification. Rather it develops a complete classification for
scores (class M) as well as a scheme for music literature (class ML).
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress at present (1956) apparently does not
classify its recordings. In the process of development of rules for
</p>
<p>cataloging records (ca. 1952) the Library of Congress adopted the
</p>
<p>following terminology for various types of sound recordings:
</p>
<p>Phonorecord -- any sound recording of any of the
following or other types
</p>
<p>Phonodisc -- a phonograph record of disc type
Phonocylinder -- a recording on a cylinder
Phonofilm -- sound film
Phonoroll a player-piano or player-organ roll
Phonotape a tape recording
Phonowire -- a wire recording
</p>
<p>Both the Library of Congress and the Decimal classifications pro-
vide for the arrangement of music and scores by types of music. Sub-
ject headings are also assigned to music materials to enable readers
to find books about or scores for a particular type oi music. Thus the
cataloger must know something about types and fcrme of music.
</p>
<p>C. The Terminology' of Music
</p>
<p>Most music falls readily into one of two groupings ~- vocal or
instrumental music. These may be combined, as in opera, musical
comedy, church music, etc. , the instrumental music providing the
accompaniment for the vocal music , The published words of the
performance are called the libretto. Songs in operas are called
arias, especially if extended or repeated by the composer. Vocal
music may be performed as a solo, duet, trio, quartet, quintet,
sextet, septet, octet, nonet or chorus, with or with oaf instrumental --
</p>
<p>or even vocal -- accompaniment.
</p>
<p>Instrumental music may be performed by a single instrument or by
many. A composition for a single instrument may be called a piece ,
ballade , etude, intermezzo, nocturre, prelude, sonata, toccata, fugue,
gavotte , humoresoue, march, p&amp;ssacagjia, polka, fox^trot, waltz ,
rondo, rumba, polonaise, etc. Some of these titles or names describe
a standardized type of music form, e.g. the march 9 and are used as
subject headings; others, e.g. a nocturne , have not become standardized
in form or character, and are therefore not commonly used as subject
headings .
</p>
<p>Compositions for two performers are called duets; for three,
trios; etc. Music for small groups of three or more instruments
suitable for playing in a small room is cabled chamber, or chamber-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>43 - 3
</p>
<p>orchestra, music. Music for larger groups is known as orchestral
music, and there are many special types of orchestras, e.g.,
symphony orchestras, string orchestras, dance orchestras, salon-
orchestras, bands, etc.
</p>
<p>Music composed for orchestras is of many varieties. It includes
elaborate pieces with movements (sections played at a different tempo,
or speed) such as symphonies (four movements), concertos (orchestral
accompaniment for a solo instrument, generally, and in three move-
ments), jiuiteis (dance music in "classical
</p>
<p>11 form, in several movements,
for orchestra or solo instruments) and symphonic poems (orchestral
compositions not in any of the generally recognized musical forms but
</p>
<p>following or illustrating a prescribed program) . Orchestral music
also includes such less elaborate pieces as overtures (pre- cur tain
music for operas or suitable for such a purpose even though not com-
posed for a specific opera), chorale preludes , and many of the musical
forms also written for solo instruments or small groups of instruments.
</p>
<p>Once composed, music is subject to further experimentation. Com-
posers prepare arrangements or transc riptions of their own or others 1
</p>
<p>compositions for instruments other than those for which the pieces were
originally written. They compose variations on themes of their own or
taken from the compositions of others. Variations, for single instru-
ments, chamber orchestras or symphony orchestras, may become
more famous than the original theme e, which are usually no more than
a bar or two long. Performers or arrangers may prepare medleys or
potpourris of several compositions (selections condensed and played
successively without pause). The terms used above comprise only a
very small portion of the highly specialized vocabulary in this field.
Even though he may be a musician, one of the resources of the cataloger
is the musical dictionary.
</p>
<p>The cataloging of music scores and phonograph records will be
taken up separately in the next two chapters.

</p>
<p>Music Scores
</p>
<p>With the growing popularity of music in America, libraries of all
kinds are faced with an increasing demand for scores. In the past
decade , the number of libraries capitulating to this demand has in-
creased tremendously. With the addition of scores to the collection,
it becomes necessary to know something about them in order to make
them properly available to readers through the card catalog and by
other means.
</p>
<p>A. Forms of Publication
</p>
<p>Scores are published in several forms. The most common type
of score is the instrumental or vocal score for a single composition
for one or two persons. Another form of publication is the collected
edition, which may include many works by the same composer, or
many works by different composers.
</p>
<p>In the case of complex musical compositions, more complicated
forms of publication can naturally be expected. Orchestral works
(for numerous instruments) are usually issued in parts, one part for
each player. These present an unusual, although not difficult, prob-
lem to the cataloger dealing with scores for the first time. Because
the conductor of the orchestra must be able to see the music for all
the instruments simultaneously, these works are also published in a
combined edition. This edition is usually called the orchestral score,
as distinguished from the parts . There is great demand for scores
among concert-goers and others. A reduced size useful to them,
even if a larger score is available, is called the miniature score .
While the music in a miniature score is in a print too fine for con-
ductors under actual performance or rehearsal conditions, it, not
they, can be read easily in a good light.
</p>
<p>These different forms of publication may be kept together in the
library, so that all the work of Beethoven would be together, includ-
ing collected editions, scores and parts, and miniature scores. How-
ever, in a library which classifies music by form, it will be impos-
sible to keep together collected editions and scores for different
forms of music by the same composer . Music libraries usually find
it more convenient to separate miniature scores from the larger ones
intended for performance purposes.
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44 - 2
</p>
<p>B. Classification
</p>
<p>As pointed out in the preceding chapter, music is generally separa-
ted in most libraries from the literature about it. Assuming that the
collection of music scores is to be a separate one, there still remains
the problem of its arrangement. Many libraries are content to arrange
the collection of scores alphabetically by composer, perhaps using a
Cutter number. Collections of works by several composers may be
shelved under titles or the names of compilers. Other libraries em-
ploy the Decimal, Library of Congress, or other subject classification
schemes for the purpose of keeping together musical works of the same
form or type. Thus, call numbers for Beethoven's Piano Concerto no.
3 1 opus 37, might vary as follows:
</p>
<p>B4 Library arranging all works alphabetically by composer
op. 37
</p>
<p>785.66 Library using Decimal Classification
B4
no. 3
</p>
<p>M1010 Library using Library of Congress classification
B4
no. 3
</p>
<p>Individual works may be distinguished within the alphabetical
composer arrangement by opus numbers. In a classification by
musical form, works may be more usefully distinguished by numer-
ical work marks, as shown above, or by alphabetical work marks, as
below:
</p>
<p>785.5 Overtures
</p>
<p>785.5 Beethoven, Ludwig van, 1770-1827
B4c Consecration of the house overture
</p>
<p>785.5 Beethoven, Ludwig van, 1770-1827
B4co Coriolan overture
</p>
<p>785.5 Beethoven Ludwig van, 1770-1827
B4e Egmont overture
</p>
<p>The standard form division 08 may be used for collections by
different composers, in order that the numbers without the 08 may
include composers only, e.g.
</p>
<p>785.508 Smith, Robert King, 1903- ed.
S5 Famous overtures of the 19th century.
</p>
<p>However, as in literature, this form division should not be used for
collections of the works of a single composer, so that his compositions
in the same musical form may be shelved together:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44 * 3
</p>
<p>785.5 Beethoven, Ludwig van, 1770-1827
B4 Overtures (a collection)
</p>
<p>Music arranged for a particular instrument or ensemble is more
usefully classified with music composed for that medium, not with the
medium for which it was originally composed:
</p>
<p>786.408 Denton, Frederick Prince, 1875-1942, arr.
D4 Great overtures , arranged for piano
</p>
<p>not
785.508
D4
</p>
<p>And
</p>
<p>786.4 Beethoven, Ludwig van, 1770-1827
B4 Overture, arranged for piano
</p>
<p>not
785.5
B4
</p>
<p>C . Main and Added Entries
</p>
<p>Music is properly entered under the name of the composer, as
that is the most common approach made by persons attempting to
locate a particular composition, and is in harmony with the general
practice of author as main entry. Composer entry for music meets
with many of the problems posed by author entry for books, e.g. ,
editors, anonymous classics (usually called folk-songs, or traditional
melodies), adaptations, corporate authors (e.g. church hymnals), works
of doubtful composership (e.g. the Star Spangled Banner), joint com-
posers (the term "joint comp. 11 is, however, not customarily used),
and, rarely, pseudonymous works and modern anonymous works. Thus,
the problems of musical entry are not greatly more simple than those
of author entry for books .
</p>
<p>In addition, music presents certain entry problems encountered
less often or not at all in cataloging books. The most common of these
are the problems presented by different composers of words (libretto)
and music for the same composition, and that presented by multi-
lingual titles of the same work;. .
</p>
<p>1 . Vocal Music
</p>
<p>Compositions with both words and music are customarily entered
under the composer of the music, since the libretto is universally
considered to be generally only a vehicle for the music and to provide
less enjoyment for the audience than the music. Operas, operettas,
musical comedies, and songs are thus generally best-known by their
composers. As a result, librettos published even without music are</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44 - 4
</p>
<p>customarily entered under the composer of the music, even though he
may not even be named in the work.
</p>
<p>Sullivan, Sir Arthur Seymour, 1842- 1900.
H.M.S. Pinafore (The lass that loved a sailor); a comic
</p>
<p>opera in two acts; words by W .S . Gilbert.
</p>
<p>I. Gilbert, Sir William Schwenck, 1836-1911.
</p>
<p>However, if a libretto is published also, with identical text, as
a literary work, or was originally written as a literary work (and
later set to music without change of text), main entry may be made
for the literary editions under the name of the librettist. But for
editions published as librettos, main entry is customarily made under
the name of the composer, with added entry for the librettist. The
following examples are taken from ALA rule 12A(2);
</p>
<p>Millay, Edna St. Vincent, 1892-
The King's henchman; a play in three acts
</p>
<p>Taylor, Deems, 1885-
The King
</p>
<p>1 s henchman, lyric drama in three acts; book by
Edna St. Vincent Millay , music by Deems Taylor.
</p>
<p>I. Millay, Edna St. Vincent, 1892- The King's henchman.
</p>
<p>[The examples given below show the kind of references
which may be used to connect entries under both
librettist and composer]
</p>
<p>Millay, Edna St. Vincent, 1892-
The King's henchman.
Editions of this work published as librettos of the opera by
</p>
<p>Deems Taylor are entered under the name of the composer.
</p>
<p>Taylor, Deems, 1885-
The King's henchman.
Editions without the music, published as literary works
</p>
<p>rather than as librettos, are entered under the name of the
dramatist, Edna St. Vincent Millay .
</p>
<p>2 . Collections of Music
</p>
<p>Collections of music by one composer are, of course, entered
under his name, but collections of the work of several composers
should be entered under the name of the person responsible for col-
lecting the material together. Often this person is an arranger, and
the entry may indicate this fact.
</p>
<p>Loes, Harry Dixon, compiler andarr.
Let youth sing; a junior -intermediate hymnal for all
</p>
<p>purposes.
</p>
<p>Or, if the compiler undertook no arranging:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44 - 5
</p>
<p>Golde, Walter, 1887- compiler.
Easy German classic songs.
</p>
<p>The abbreviation "comp.", for "compiler", even though used with
music by the Library of Congress, should be avoided on cards for music,
as it is likely to be mistaken for the word "composer."
</p>
<p>Pasticcio* (musical "pies", consisting of selections from several
operas) should be entered under the person most responsible for the
collection, as readers will most probably remember them this way.
</p>
<p>Similarly, potpourris and medleys of the works of more than one
composer should be entered under the name of the arranger or com-
poser of the medley.
</p>
<p>Compositions by two or more composers should be entered under
the composer named first on the music, with added entries for the
others, if there are no more than three composers. This, of course,
is merely a restatement of the principle of joint authorship as applied
to books.
</p>
<p>3 . Musical Kin
</p>
<p>"Musical kin" -- compositions related to, or based on, other
compositions -- may be treated according to the same principles
applied to the cataloging of "literary kin" (cf . chapter 24).
</p>
<p>In the class "musical kin" may be placed incidental music, ar-
rangements (transcriptions), variations, caprices (capriccios) ,
ballets based on published literary works, cadenzas (embellish-
ments added to concertos by soloists), medleys (potpourris), etc.
When based upon the work of a single composer, the choice of main
entry must usually be made between the original composer and the
person responsible for the new material, always with added entry for
the person not chosen as main entry.
</p>
<p>Choice of main entry should be based primarily on the signifi-
cance of the added material, or, in other words, on the degree to
which the original music has been altered. This is in accordance
with the principle of probable association. Thus a medley of several
compositions of a single composer is still primarily the work of that
composer, though added entry may be made for the arranger if his
contribution is significant. On the other hand, variations should be
entered under the name of the adapter, for his contribution is repre-
sentative of his own style of composition and also dwarfs in length the
brief theme borrowed from the original composer. In the case of
variations, an added entry may be made for the composer of the
original theme, if the cataloger feels it would be useful.
</p>
<p>It is not customary to relate dramatic music to the original play
by which it was inspired, unless it was written to be played at an
actual performance (incidental music) . Thus:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44 - 6
</p>
<p>Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Felix. 1809-1847.
[Midsummer night 1 8 dream. Excerpts]
Overture and incidental music to A midsummer night's
</p>
<p>dreamt .
I. Shakespeare, William/A midsummer night's dream
</p>
<p>II. Title.
</p>
<p>But:
</p>
<p>Prokof'ev, Sergei Sergeevich, 1891-1953.
Romeo and Juliet.
I. Title.
</p>
<p>However, the added entry for Shakespeare should be omitted even in
the case of the incidental music if the cataloger felt it would not be
useful in his particular library.
</p>
<p>4 . Form of Author Entry
</p>
<p>Choice of form of author entry involves two basic conflicts:
(1) the desire (motivated by the complex nature of music catalog-
ing) for simplicity of entry, and (2) the desire (identically motiva-
</p>
<p>ted) to use Library of Congress cards. The Library of Congress
employs a fullness or technicality of entry that sometimes results in
failure of the patron to recognize or locate the name of a favorite
composer, e.g.
</p>
<p>Mozart, Johann Chryso storn Wolfgang Amadeus , 1756-1791.
Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Felix, 1809-1847.
Chaikovskii, Petr Il'ich, 1840-1893.
Handel, Georg Friedrich, 1685-1759-
</p>
<p>Cataloger s wishing to make use of Library of Congress cards
are advised to follow LC practice with respect to fullness of names,
taking care to make such cross-references as may be needed. Use of
standard transliteration practice, which forces the customary
Tchaikovskii to Chaikovskii, can hardly be condoned in a library
that prides itself on service to readers.
</p>
<p>Dates of birth and death are of considerably more importance for
composers than for authors, particularly in the cataloging of phonograph
records, which are almost never dated, and undated scores. Under
subject headings, the composers 1 dates, especially for little -known
composers, are the only guide to the type of music represented by
the catalog card. The catalog of even the smallest library of music
or records should include composers 1 dates. Compare Fig. 44-1.</p>

<p>That music is a universal language and needs no translating to be
enjoyed has often resulted in the publication of the same composition
in scores of countries the world over. Although the musical notation
is not changed in each different country, the title often is. Indeed,
titles are frequently changed in different editions of the same composi-
tion published in the same country or city. While proper-name dis-
tinctive titles of compositions , e.g. Rigoletto , Carmen, etc., are
rarely changed, other quite distinctive titles are often translated,
e.g. Moaart'sDie Zauberflttte becomes The Magic Flute, Strauss
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>Bin Heldenleben is translated A Hero's Cite, etc. The habit of com-
posers of calling their compositions only by the names of types of
music, common practice over a period of hundreds of years, e.g.
Piano Sonato no . 3 , Concerto no. 1 for Piano and Orchestra,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44-8
</p>
<p>Symphony mo. 4 , etc. , hit* encouraged internationally the translation of
these title*, and, locally j such juggling and rearrangement as the fol-
lowing list of titles of the fourteenth sonata written by Beethoven for
the piano:
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>Beethoven's Moonlight sonata. Op. 27, no. 2.
Deux senates (quasi fantaisies) No. 2, Ut min.
Gran* sonata per cembalo o pianoforte, opera 27 , n. 2 .
Klaviersonate in Cis moll, Op. 27, No. 2.
Sonata, Do min. (Chiaro di luna) Op. 27, n. 2.

</p>

Sonate, Pp. 27, Nr. 2 (Die sogenannte Mondscheinsonate)
Zwei Sonaten in Form von Fantasien. Op. 27 , No . 2 .
</p>
<p>Users of the card catalog wish to make an intelligent selection
from the various editions of each composition listed under the name
of any one composer. For this reason, it has become customary to
file all the editions together, and to add to the catalog card, in addition
to the title-page title (or cover* title), a title that seems suitable for the
purpose of describing all the editions and which can be used as a filing
t^tle. This kind of title, in music cataloging, is called a conventional
title . It is typed (and usually enclosed in brackets) just under the
</p>
<p>composer entry, and just above the title-page title, e.g.
</p>

</p>
<p>In the case of voluminous composers like Beethoven, persons
unaware of the principle of the conventional title may look among the
Beethoven cards under the initial letter of the nick-name or alternative
title, so that a cross-reference is very useful:
</p>

</p>
<p>Such cross-references may be traced on the main entry card for
the composition, as shown in Fig. 44-4. However, this practice can-
not be recommended with any enthusiasm, even for small libraries
(where perhaps the reference is not needed).
</p>
<p>Instead, and particularly, if the catalog lists several scores for
the same composition, it is better to set up an authority card for the
composition, on which such references may be traced. Title cross-
references may be substituted for title entries, with a saving of
several cards if there are several editions of the score, e.g.

<p>Use of a conventional title is strongly recommended for all com-
positions, and for all collections of compositions by any one composer,
in all sices and types of libraries owning music collections. Many
librarians object to the use of conventional titles in cases where they are
the same as the title-page title, because of the resulting redundant
and ludicrous effect (see Fig. 44-6).

<p>Fig. 44-6. Use of Conventional Title Similar to Title-

</p>
<p>The writer believes that filing problems will be simplified if
conventional titles are always used, with the title-page title omitted
when it is substantially the same, as shown in Fig. 44-7. This
method will also have the advantage of eliminating the absurd visual
effect of unnecessary repetition of the title . In addition, it will
</p>
<p>simplify the establishment of a systematic plan for title cross-
references instead of added entries.
</p>
<p>Besides bringing together all editions of a particular composi-
tion, conventional titles may be used to bring together complete or
partial collections of the work of a particular composer, e.g. ,
</p>

</p>
<p>Just as complete and selected collections of the works of volumi-
nous literary authors (e.g. Shakespeare) are more usefully filed to-
gether before the cards for individual works, so are the cards for
collected works of composers. Thus the examples given just above
would be filed before the following entry:
</p>
<p>Bach, Johann Sebastian, 1685-1750-
[The art of fugue]
</p>
<p>In the case of numerous editions of a particular composition,
cards for complete editions may be filed first, followed by cards
for excerpts, e.g.
</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky, Peter Hitch, 1840-1893.
[The queen of spades]
</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky, Peter Hitch, 1840-1893.

<p>The conventional title may be adjusted to permit other useful and
logical methods of arranging the catalog cards f as the arrangement
of cards for vocal music by languages, e.g.
</p>
<p>Verdi, Giuseppe, 1813-1901.

<p>A very detailed treatment of the technique of devising conventional
titles to create a logical arrangement of the cards for various editions
of a single musical work is found in Library of Congress rule 9:2, out-
lined here for the guidance of the reader:

</p>
<p>Many catalogers will take exception to the principle on which
Library of Congress rule 9:2C2 (language of the conventional title
for titles not consisting solely of certain names of types of composi-
tions) is based. This rule provides that the original title be given in
its original language if that language was English, French, German,
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese or Latin, and provided the title does not
consist solely of the name of a certain type of composition. If the
original title was in a language other than those named, the title in
most common use in the United States is used as the conventional
title , and, if no title is found to be in common use in this country,
either (a) the title in the original language is used in transliteration,
if in a non-Roman alphabet, (b) a temporary conventional title is
established, or (c) the use of a conventional title is postponed.
</p>
<p>This rule presupposes that the users of music collections are
familiar with the six foreign languages arbitrarily chosen by the
Library of Congress for conventional titles (no matter how popular
the English title may be in this country) . These languages are
humorously described --if unintentionally so -- by the Library of
Congress as Mthe languages most commonly read in this country. 11
Public librarians (and many others) will perhaps suggest that this
description be changed to read Mthe languages most commonly read
in the Library of Congress. M For what does it matter if they are
the six most commonly read if they are not commonly read by any
one reader? In a day when it is possible to graduate from some col-
leges without studying even one foreign language, what effect will
this unrealistic Library of Congress practice have upon the users of
the public or college library? Even though some American users
may read a few of these languages, most of them would be embar-
rassed by unfamiliarity with pronunciation customs in discussing the
titles with librarians. The great majority of librarians, even music
librarians , undoubtedly cannot read more than a few of these langu-
age s, let alone pronounce them. If phonograph records are ever to
be widely circulated by American public libraries, and if those
libraries are to maintain card catalogs that are effective, the con-
ventional title must be given in English, in all cases where an English
title is in fairly common use (not necessarily the most frequent use),
regardless of the language or wording of the title of the first edition.
Indeed, the libraries might well attempt to formulate an English
title for compositions for which no title in English was found to be
in common use .
</p>
<p>The circulation of music materials, especially phonograph re-
cords, by libraries is only just coming into its own as an important
service. The obstacle of the unnecessary use of foreign languages
in such a key position on the catalog cards will be a formidable de-
terrent to the popularisation of music.
</p>
<p>There are three main types of conventional titles:
</p>
<p>(1) those consisting solely of certain names of types of music ,
e.g. Piano sonatas. These are given by the Library of
Congress in English where an English term is used.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44* 15
</p>
<p>(2) those consisting of proper names, or other untranslatable
names, e.g.
</p>
<p>Beethoven, Ludprigvan, 1770-1827
</p>
<p>These cannot , or should not, be translated. In many
libraries no conventional title is used for these, especially
if there are few editions, since the filing would not be greatly
affected. On the other hand, it would seem better to use a
conventional title and to omit, instead, the title-page title.
</p>
<p>(3) those consisting of words not proper nouns, and not consist-
ing solely of the names of types of music. These can be, and
have been, translated for popular American usage, and, in
the writer's opinion, the use of the English language will
make a card catalog more effective, e.g.
</p>
<p>Dukas, Paul, 1865-1935
[The sorcerer
</p>
<p>f s apprentice]
</p>
<p>not
</p>
<p>not
</p>
<p>Dukas, Paul, 1865-1935
[L'apprenti sorcier] (LC practice)
</p>
<p>Rossini, Ciocchino, 1792-1868
[The barber of Seville]
</p>
<p>Rossini, Giocchino, 1792-1868
[II barbiere di Siviglia] (LC practice)
</p>
<p>Puccini, Giacomo, 1858-1924
[The girl of the golden West]
</p>
<p>not
</p>
<p>Puccini, Giacomo, 1858-1924
[La fanciulla del West] (LC practice)
</p>
<p>If no English title is in common usage, the librarian may ^supply
his own English translation, or employ a popularly-used foreign one:
</p>
<p>Mosart, Wolfgang Amadeu*, 1756-1791
[Cosi fan tutte]
</p>
<p>However, this title need not necessarily be the original title.
</p>
<p>If the title consists solely of certain names of types of music,
it is "conventionalised99 by rearranging the words (or adding some)
so that the type of music is named first, followed by the medium, e.g.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44 - 16
</p>
<p>Piano Concerto no. 2
becomes
</p>
<p>[Concerto, piano, no. 2]
</p>
<p>Quartet no. 2 in G, op. 18 , no. 2
becomes
</p>
<p>[Quartetj strings* no. 2, op. 18, no. 2, G major]
</p>
<p>Inevitably, however, some titles consist only partially (not
"solely
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>) of certain names of types of music. These are better left
in their normal sequence, e.g.
</p>
<p>[The art of fugue]
</p>
<p>[Classical symphony]
</p>
<p>[American sketches]
</p>
<p>[Brandenburg concerto no. 3]
</p>
<p>If there is doubt as to whether the title consists of a name of a
type of music suitable for inverting, a practical procedure is to invert
the conventional title if a similarly-worded subject heading is in use
by the library. Thus:
</p>
<p>Actual title Conventional title Subject Heading
Sonata for piano
Midnight waltz
</p>
<p>Symphonic variations
Ricercari for piano
</p>
<p>Sonata 9 piano] Sonatas (Piano)
Midnight waltz] Waltzes
Symphonic variations] Variations (Orchestra)
Ricercari for piano Fugues (Piano with
</p>
<p>and orchestra and orchestra] orchestra)
</p>
<p>The basic exceptions to Library of Congress conventional title
practice described in this section may be followed by catalogers
without sacrificing the advantages of using older Library of Congress
cards, for, happily, the Library of Congress left, on those, "be-
tween the conventional title and the transcription of the title appearing
on the work, a space . . . for another conventional title for those li-
braries that do not wish to use the one chosen by the Library of
Congress. 1* The prospect, however, of three titles for the same
composition, one right after another, below the composer's name,
is not an attractive one. Possibly for this reason, LC no longer
leaves this line vacant. Real progress will come only when (1)
printed catalog cards with conventional titles in English become
available, and (2) when the practice of omitting the title-page title
when it is substantially the same as the title-page title becomes
accepted. The writer knows of no library that follows this practice
(Fig. 44-7), but urges acceptance of the idea.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>E. Descriptive Cataloging
</p>
<p>The JLC rules for descriptive cataloging cove* music scores quite
thoroughly (rule 9). The principles used in cataloging scores are
similar, o course , to those used in cataloging books. Scores have
certain unusual characteristics that become cataloging problems
requiring special solutions. These result chiefly from problems in
dating and identifying different editions of scores, and from the
nature of part scores .
</p>
<p>1 . Plate Numbers
</p>
<p>Music cannot be set in type as easily and inexpensively as litera-
ture. Accurate proof-reading is of utmost importance, since errors
are not as obvious as are typographical errors in books. One typo-
graphical error in a music score might ruin the reputation of a per-
forming musician, if he were playing the score for the first time!
For these reasons, music publishers use the same plates over and
over, for many decades or for even more than a century. In such
cases, plate numbers are useful in distinguishing one edition from
another, or in bringing out the fact that two editions were printed
from the same plates. The plate number usually appears at the bot-
tom of each page of engraved music, and often on the title-page. It
is particularly useful if no date appears in the score. The publisher 1 *
number --a serial number used by some publishers somewhat in the
manner of a stock or order number-- may also serve a useful biblio-
graphic purpose if no date or plate number is available.
</p>
<p>In large libraries it will be useful to quote the plate number
whether or not the score contains the date of publication .
</p>
<p>2. Collation
</p>
<p>In most libraries, scores are identified as such in the collation
(or the conventional title in the case of certain arrangements) to
avoid confusion between music literature and actual music. The
number of pages may then be given, serving as a means of distin-
guishing between editions and also as something of a guide to the
length of the work. Thus:
</p>
<p>Score (4 p.)
Miniature Score (282 p.)
</p>
<p>If parts are included, readers may wish to know how many are
available, and this may be given on the card. Some librarians write
the- actual number of parts in pencil, so that the figure can be changed
easily if more are obtained. Other librarians prefer to record the
number of parts only in the shelflist.
</p>
<p>Score (56 p.) and 15 parts.
Score (2 v.) and f$ parts.
Score (56 p.) and parts.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44 - 18
</p>
<p>F. Subject Headings
</p>
<p>Subject headings for music should really be called form headings.
In spite of the large number of scores about the sea (Debussy1 s La
Mer, for example), it is doubtful whether much light is shed onTEe
physical nature of the ocean. Many music-lovers would contend* of
course, that this is not so. Some librarians may wish to assign such
headings as OCEAN- -MUSIC to such works. Generally, however,
form headings are given preference to subject headings. The addition
of lyrics to a musical score tends to change the picture, however. The
</p>
<p>heading SEA-SONGS may be used for songs about the sea, or for songs
sung by sailors. However, the heading SEA MUSIC or OCEAN--MUSIC
cannot be justified, according to most catalogers. Thus do librarians
ignore the views, held by generations of composers, that music can
express subject-matter.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress has published its list of subject headings
in the field of music. * These may be readily adapted to any large col-
lection of music scores, or used, as intended, for a combined collec-
tion of literature and scores. The theory of specific entry is followed
very strictly, and the cataloger should not overlook such very specific
entries as SOLO CANTATAS, or PSALMS (MUSIC)-- 150TH PSALM,
or CHORUSES, SACRED (WOMEN'S VOICES, 4 PTS. ) WITH STRING
ORCHESTRA, etc. It must constantly be remembered that the list
includes only headings actually used on LC printed cards. Thus, the
heading CHORUSES, SACRED (WOMEN'S VOICES, 4 PTS.) WITH
HARPSICHORD is not listed but should be used if the library obtains
a score or phonograph record fitting that description.
</p>
<p>The writer heartily approves of such specific entries, although
the length of the headings could be cut back in many cases in the
future growth of the collection can be anticipated.
</p>
<p>One of the annoying features of the LC subject heading list is the
use of the term VIOLONCELLO instead of the now universally used
CELLO. Unenlightened practices of this sort can serve only to de-
grade libraries and librarians in the eyes of their public . The term
violoncello is also used exclusively by the Library of Congress in
making up conventional titles.
</p>
<p>The importance of an adequate cross-reference network cannot
be exaggerated. This is particularly true in the case of such a specific
heading as SOLO CANTATAS. This heading, and similar ones, will, of
course, be lost to many users of the catalog unless the vital reference
</p>
<p>CANTATAS
see also
</p>
<p>SOLO CANTATAS
is provided.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44 - 19
</p>
<p>Subject headings reflecting nationality and chronology in music
are generally not provided in card catalogs. These approaches can,
however, be obtained by a very simple device. Two references
from appropriate headings may be made to the name of each com-
poser, thus:
</p>
<p>Bach, Johann Sebastian, 1685-1750 .
xx GERMAN MUSIC
xx BAROQUE MUSIC (1600-1750)
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>Ravel, Maurice, 1875-1937..
xx FRENCH MUSIC
xx TWENTIETH CENTURY MUSIC
</p>
<p>This practice will result in lengthy sets of cross-reference cards
under such headings as TWENTIETH CENTURY MUSIC and FRENCH
MUSIC. Need should determine practice, as usual.

<p>Phonograph Records
</p>
<p>In 1952 the Library of Congress published its rules for descriptive
cataloging of phonograph records. 1 These rules also covered other
aural media, such as wire and tape recordings, player-piano rolls,
etc. The Library of Congress coined the term flphonorecords n to cover
all these media, and, in addition, coined other specific terms to fit
individual media, e.g. phonodiscs, for disc- type phonograph records.
</p>
<p>A. Purpose of Cataloging
</p>
<p>Recordings need cataloging even more than books, for, while books
are usually published in separate covers, many phonograph records con-
tain two or more separately composed musical works. Thus phonograph
records do not lend themselves to a simple shelf arrangement by com-
poser . Further, although musical compositions are not usually "revised"
in the sense that books are revised, they appear in many arrangements,
for various instruments, and are played or sung by many different artists.
Thus it may become necessary to locate all or specific performances of
each composition. In addition, a reader may call for any compositions
played or sung by his favorite performer, or he may ask for music by
any of various types, e.g. symphonies, waltzes, piano music, sonatas,
etc. Shelf arrangement cannot possibly provide all these approaches.
</p>
<p>If the library could collect a reasonably large number of records,
it would be possible to use the catalogs printed for or by various manu-
facturers and dealers. This would be a makeshift device to the extent
that such catalogs were incomplete, or to the extent that the library's
holdings were incomplete. The Schwann Catalog of Long-playing
Records was, in the early years of the long-playing record, complete,
and could therefore be used in this fashion. Now that many long-playing
records have gone out of print, libraries using the Schwann Catalog as
an index to their collections would find that they own many records no
longer listed.
</p>
<p>Card catalogs at present offer the best hope for providing for the
various reader approaches to records. The techniques used are
similar to those described in the preceding chapter for cataloging music
scores, with the exceptions described below.

<p>B. Multiple Main Entries
</p>
<p>A single record qr album may frequently require two or more main
entries. This is true if the disc contains more than one composition or
if the disc label or album title does not employ a title covering , in its
scope i all of the compositions. It is also true if the compositions do not
lend themselves to the invention of such a title by the cataloger . Thus a
disc containing two symphonies requires two main entries. In order to
keep track of the number and location of main entries made, one copy of
each entry assigned to a single disc should be filed in the shelflist. All
such shelflist cards, except the last, may be marked "Continued on next
card' 1 to indicate that the group of cards represents a single record or
album. Or, a special non- unit-card listing all the main entries used for
the record maybe prepared for the shelflist as shown in Fig. 45-1.

</p>
<p>The Library of Congress makes a practice of limiting a phono-
graph record to one main entry per composer. If a record contains
works by two or more composers, separate sets of unit cards are
made for each composer. But if a record contains more than one
work by the same composer, LC usually limits him to one set of unit
cards. The cataloger must then describe both compositions on the
same unit card. This is a relatively simple task. However, the
conventional title becomes a problem in such cases. The conventional
title on the main card may describe only one of the compositions, as
shown in Fig. 45-2. As a result, the impression created by some of</p>

<p>the abided and subject entry cards is odd, to say the least. In the
example shown as Fig. 45-3, the casual reader may assume, if he

looking under subject headings may easily overlook the composition

to commend it. If the practice is not followed, a set of unit cards</p>

catalog. It also may mean two or more entries under the same
artist for the same phonograph record. Some librarians do not
follow the LC practice, preferring to make a set of unit cards for
each composition.
</p>
<p>Variations provide one of the few natural opportunities for insert-

</p>
<p>In cataloging the record partly covered by Fig. 45-2, only two unit
cards were made. This was done in accordance with LC practice. A
third composition, Five Waltzes, op. 39, by Brahms, is handled by an
added entry traced on the main card for the Brahms Variations (Fig.
45-2, back).
</p>
<p>C . Main Entry Under Artist
</p>
<p>Many records contain several compositions chosen because they
are performed by a single artist. A useful main entry may be made
under the name of the artist if there are too many compositions to
make a separate main entry card - under composer -- for each, as
shown in Fig. 45-4.</p>

Classification in this library is by size
and manufacturer's number.
</p>
<p>In such cases, the name of the artist may be repeated after the title,
to show that the work was not composed by the artist. The Library
of Congress and the ALA do not recognize the principle of artist
main-entry. However, it is a useful one, and often saves making
an unnecessary title card. Use of entry for performing artist
follows the same principle as entry under painter for books consist-
ing primarily of art reproductions. If a record is obviously manu-
factured for the purpose of displaying the voice of a singer rather
than the works of a composer , it is logical that main entry should be</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>45-6
</p>
<p>made under the name ol that singer rather than under title. Perhaps
the ALA and the Library of Congress will ultimately recognize this
principle .
</p>
<p>tt almost goes without saying that the use of conventional titles
under artists 1 names would be meaningless and should not be attempted,
The titles given to such phonograph records are not related to any
other records.
</p>
<p>D. Main Entry Under Title
</p>
<p>If the compositions on one record are chosen by the manufacturer
because they are performed on the same instrument or are written in
the same musical form, entry may be made under title, e.g.
</p>
<p>Waltz time in Vienna
</p>
<p>or

</p>
<p>E. Main Entry Under Composer
</p>
<p>When flie musical work or works are written by a single com-
poser, main entry is made under his name. Conventional titles
should be used as part of the main entry to bring together in one place
all recordings and arrangements of musical works issued with various
titles and in various languages. Composer- title authority cards should
be made for conventional titles, when cross-references from alterna-
tive titles (either directly under* title or under composer or both) are
needed. If cross-references are not needed, the composer- title
authority cards become something of a luxury. Such an authority card
is shown as Fig. 44-5 in the preceding chapter.
</p>
<p>Conventional titles may be supplemented by the label title, as
shown in Fig. 45-2, when the label title is substantially (unrecogniz-
ably) different from the conventional title . If the two titles are not
substantially different, the label title need not be repeated, as shown
in Fig. 45-6.

<p>F. Descriptive Cataloging
</p>
<p>Descriptive cataloging seeks to help the listener and librarian to
</p>
<p>distinguish one performance of the same composition from another,
and also to help them select between the two (or more) performances.
The listener wants to select the performance best suited to his musical
taste. However i he must also make his selection to fit the require-
ments of the phonograph on which the record is to be played.
</p>
<p>As a re suit i the following information should be given in the de-
scriptive part (body) of the catalog card, following the conventional
title:
</p>
<p>(1) The fact that the work is a phonograph record, unless
the cards are to be filed into a catalog listing records
exclusively.
</p>
<p>(2) Label title, if different from conventional title.
</p>
<p>(3) Manufacturer's name (and series referring to a collection
of independently-issued records, e.g., Bluebird Classics).
</p>
<p>(4) Manufacturer's number.
</p>
<p>(5) Date of issue.
</p>
<p>The following information is appropriate to the collation:
</p>
<p>(6) Number of sides.
</p>
<p>(7) Size.
</p>
<p>(8) Speed.
</p>
<p>(9) Series titles denoting the overall contents of a single album
or record, useful particularly for analytical cards, e.g.
Keyboard masters of old Vienna (Remington R- 199- 124) .
</p>
<p>The following information is customarily given in notes:
</p>
<p>(10) Bibliographical (i.e., discographical) information, e.g.
Program notes on slip- case.
Title from slip- case.
Etc.
</p>
<p>(11) Performers 1 names, instruments and/or voices.
</p>

<p>listeners in (1) choosing between one of several performances of a
particular composition, or (2) choosing between several composi-
tions of the same type, e.g. symphonies, concertos, etc. Thus,
full information to help these two group 9 of readers should be given
on the cards used in making these choices.
</p>
<p>These cards are the main entry cards, which are used to make
a choice of performances of the same composition, and the subject
entry cards, used to choose among compositions of the same type.
Under other added entries, particularly those for artists (per-
formers), complete information is not so important. So it is that
sometimes contents notes or detailed listings of opera casts, etc . ,
are omitted on added entry cards. Reference may be made to the
main entry for full information in such cases , as shown in Fig .
45-8.
</p>
<p>Most of the descriptiv.e information is usually given on the record
label. However, the slip-cases accompanying modern L.P records
are a very fertile source of information. The Library of Congress
catalogers acknowledge this source by using notes such as:
</p>
<p>Title from slip- case.
</p>
<p>In many libraries, no attempt is made to indicate whether in-
formation was taken from the slip-case or from the label.

The need for an extension card was probably elimina-
ted in this case. Note the use, for identification
</p>
<p>purposes, of a thematic catalog number in the con-
ventional title in the absence of opus numbers, which
Bach did not use. The capital letter "S" is the ini-
tial of the compiler (Schmieder) of the definitive
thematic catalog of Bach's compositions. The most
famous of all thematic catalogs is that of Kflchel
for Mozart f s compositions. Kflchel's !IK W numbers are
</p>
<p>universally used to identify and distinguish Mozart's
hundreds of compositions.
</p>
<p>appear on records. Frequently, however, manufacturers find it
worthwhile to copyright the text or art-work printed on slip-cases.
These copyright dates may be assumed to coincide with the issue,
or publication date, of the record.
</p>
<p>Dates are particularly useful on catalog cards for records.
Technological developments in the field of high-fidelity reproduction
have been rapid. The issue date of a recording is thus an excellent
guide to the degree of sound fidelity that may be expected from the
record, unless it is a reissue of an early recording. Consequently,
the date should always be given when known. When not known, it
should be guessed at, as:
</p>
<p>Camden CAL 157 [1953?] .
</p>
<p>An incorrect guess is better than no date at all, unless it is wrong
by a great many years. Guesses should always be expressed in such</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>45 - 11
</p>
<p>away as to indicate clearly the cataloger'a uncertainty, e.g.
</p>
<p>[1952?]
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>[195-]
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>[1951 or 2] .
</p>
<p>While matrix numbers are of potential value in dating phonograph
records, they are not customarily mentioned on catalog cards. They
would be of practical value in the extremely large collection, particu-
larly of early recordings.
</p>
<p>Series notes for phonograph records have little of the same sort
of significance as do series titles for books. Most manufacturers'
series tend to reflect a price level, e.g. RCA Victor's Bluebird
Classics, or a manufacturing aspect (such as repressing), e.g.
Columbia's Entre series, or RCA Victor's Camden series. Conse-
quently, it is recommended that such series be named along with the
name of the manufacturer in the imprint position.
</p>
<p>Cities of publication are customarily omitted from the cards, but
will be useful if given for records manufactured by non- commercial
organizations, as societies and institutions.
</p>
<p>The number of sides is usually given in the collation, partly as an
indication of probable playing time. If the actual playing time is known
(it is given on some recordings) it may be useful, e.g.
</p>
<p>1/2 s. (9:03 min.)
</p>
<p>If the composition being cataloged occupies less than one side, the
fraction should be expressed in terms of the number of visible bands .
It seems pointless to attempt to distinguish between bands of different
width except in very clear-cut cases.
</p>
<p>The collation should also include the diameter of the record, as
expressed in inches, and the speed at which it is to be played. Since
the 33-1/3 r.p.m. record goes back many years, the cataloger should
attempt to distinguish between these early records and modern long-
playing (microgroove) records. Thus, the collation may state:
</p>
<p>2 s. 12" 33-1/3 rpm microgroove.
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>2 JB. UP 12".
</p>
<p>Other variations are possible.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>45 - 12
</p>
<p>For long playing records, usually complete on one record, and,
if not, usually manufactured in automatic sequence, the statement
of sequence may be omitted. If there are several records, and if
the sequence is manual , that fact may be specified, e.g.
</p>
<p>4 s. UP 12" manual sequence
</p>
<p>The traditional series note position may be used for album or
label titles of analyzed collections, if desired, as shown in Fig. 45-9
Series notes will usually be given in this position only for collections
of. compositions by different composers, issued on one record*

The compositions in the contents note have not been
described in conventional title form by this
</p>
<p>cataloger. The cataloger also chose to classify
the longest composition on the record, although
he migjit have chosen to classify the entire record,
e. g. 31 2 43 S (S for Somer).
</p>
<p>The names and functions of performers are usually worthy of
mention, at least on main and subject cards, and may be given in
a single paragraph.
</p>
<p>For records containing several compositions by different com-
posers, contents notes are useful, particularly if analytical entries
are not made for each composer. By custom, the contents (parts,
or movements) of a single composition are not named on catalog
cards unless the performance omits some of the parts or move-
ments .</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>45 * 13
</p>
<p>In addition, a statement of other works on the same record or in
the same album is customarily given as a "With11 note, e.g. "With
Tchaikowsky, Peter I. Concerto, piano, no. 1, op. 23, B- flat minor. 11
For the sake of consistency, this information may be given in conven-
tional-title form, although this is not necessary.
</p>
<p>G. Added Entries
</p>
<p>Added entries may be useful for librettists, artists, performing
groups, regular and guest conductors, etc. Entries for regular con-
ductors may be omitted in favor of cross-references to names of their
orchestras, e.g.
</p>
<p>Ormandy, Eugene
see also
</p>
<p>Minneapolis. Symphony Orchestra, Ormandy, cond.
Philadelphia. Symphony Orchestra, Ormandy, cond.
</p>
<p>Added entries may also be made for distinctive titles of phono-
discs that are entered under names of performers. However, added
entries for titles of compositions may profitably be omitted in favor
of cross-references referring to the main entry, as shown in Fig.
44-5.
</p>
<p>H. Subject Headings
</p>
<p>Subject headings are chosen to satisfy the approach of readers
seeking special musical forms, e.g. symphonies, piano music, band
music, etc. A few subject headings suitable for phonodiscs appear in
Sear B 'List of Subject Headings , but the List of Subject Headings Used
in the Dictionary Catalogs of fee Library of Congress and especially
the list Music Subject Headings Used on Printed Catalog Cards of the
Library of Congress provide for a more adequate subject heading and
cross-reference network. See also Chapter 44.
</p>
<p>I . Classification of Phonodiscs
</p>
<p>For efficiency in shelving, records should be arranged first by
sice. Within the size group, it may be further desirable to subdivide
by playing speed. Or the collection may be first divided by speed, and
then by sice. Following this decision, any one of three important
types of sub- arrangement may be chosen by the librarian:
</p>
<p>1. By musical form, e.g. Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress
or Color classifications (see Chapter 46).
</p>
<p>2 . By composer .
</p>
<p>3. By manufacturers' serial numbers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>45 - 14
</p>
<p>Arrangement by musical form has much to commend it, although
the system practically demands a card catalog, since the composer
approach is lost. When a single disc contains two musical forms, an
arbitrary choice must be made in order to provide a basis for the
call number. The "A" side may arbitrarily be given preference.
</p>
<p>Arrangement by composer answers perhaps the most common
approach to records, i.e. the name approach. Records containing
works by more than one composer should be filed under main entry,
if a single main entry has been established. If not, preference is
arbitrarily given to one of the composers.
</p>
<p>Arrangement by manufacturers 1 serial numbers eliminates the
necessity for working out classification numbers, but does not provide
any direct logical approach to the records. Printed catalogs may be
used as indexes to collections arranged this way. The system scat-
ters different arrangements and performances of the same musical
works. However, it is simple and effective and is used by many
libraries. Records can be shelved immediately following purchase.
</p>
<p>Beethoven's "Emperor 11 concerto (concerto no. 5), as performed
by the New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra in Columbia Re-
cords album MM- 500 is classified according to the three basic
schemes below:
</p>
<p>(1) (2) (3)
</p>
<p>Musical form Composer Serial number

</p>
<p>78-12 78-12 78-12 78-12
785.66 B3 or B3C5N Col.
B3-5N op. 73 MM- 500
</p>
<p>J . Corporate Headings
</p>
<p>Corporate headings are used in music cataloging principally for
the names of performing groups, e.g. symphony and other orchestras,
quartets, opera companies, choirs, etc. Catalogers who make entries
of this type do so for patrons who are interested in listening to the
music of such groups. These patrons would usually look under the
names of such groups, so that a logical principle is to enter them
directly under their names, according to the rules of entry for socie-
ties, e.g.
</p>
<p>Alma Trio.
Robin Hood Dell Orchestra.
Budapest String Quartet.
Westminster Choir.
</p>
<p>If the name of the group is inevitably associated with that of a
city, however, entry should be made under the name of the city, e.g.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>45 - 15
</p>
<p>New York. Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra.
Paris. Orchestra syxnphonique .
</p>
<p>Actual added entries for symphony orchestras should include the
name of the conductor. This furnishes something of a rough chrono-
logical approach to the orchestra's recordings.
</p>
<p>Groups attached to institutions, e.g. churches, theatres, etc.,
will probably be found most easily by patrons if entered as subdivi-
sions following the name of the institution, for example:
</p>
<p>Orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera Company, entered as
I. Metropolitan Opera Company, New York, Orchestra.
</p>
<p>Choir of the Grace Episcopal Church, Madison, Wisconsin,
entered as
</p>
<p>I. Madison, Wis. Grace Episcopal Church. Choir.

<p>CHAPTER 46
</p>
<p>The Bible as an Example of Complex Organization
Problems in the Card Catalog
</p>
<p>A. Main Entry
</p>
<p>In the preceding chapters dealing with music, the problem of
many different titles for the same work was introduced, and the
11 conventional title 11 as one solution to that problem was discussed.
We come now to the single work that has been published in more
translations, editions, and printings, with a greater variety of title-
pages, than any other book ever written -- the Bible.
</p>
<p>Since the Bible is actually a single work in many editions, print-
ings, translations, etc. , its cataloging might be governed by the same
rules used for ordinary books. Since it was written, for the most
part, anonymously, this would result in entry under title, with an
edition entitled The Holy Bible entered in the H's, an edition called
The Illustrated Bible in the I's, and other editions similarly scat-
tered. Because readers wish to be able to compare available edi-
tions before making a selection, the custom has grown up of entering
all editions under the single title Bible , with reference from other
common titles, in the manner of other anonymous classics (cf. chapter
19) . For example:
</p>
<p>Holy Bible .
see
</p>
<p>Bible.
</p>
<p>Thus, the word Bible is, in effect, used as a conventional title.
Since it is anonymous, the conventional title takes the place of the
author entry, and, by custom, is not bracketed. In small libraries
owning only a few Bibles this simple conventional title may be con-
sidered adequate, with the few cards subarranged by title-page titles,
as shown in the filing sequence on the next page.
</p>
<p>B . Subarrangement
</p>
<p>However, in larger libraries owning numerous editions, transla-
tions, commentaries and separately published parts, a simple alpha-
betical arrangement by title-page title under the single word Bible
becomes chaotic, and ceases to serve the purposes of the reader.
Catalogers discovered this long ago, and began to subarrange cards
under the word Bible in a logical, rather than an alphabetical,
arrangement, as for example, arranging cards for complete Bibles
(often called "whole Bibles") ahead of cards for parts such as the Old
and New Testaments, and grouping together the cards for English
editions, with other foreign language editions filed together by language,

</p>
<p>O
</p>
<p>These catalogers soon discovered the necessity for writing the
</p>
<p>appropriate filing words after the word Bible , for otherwise the sub-
arrangement was not apparent to users of the catalog, e.g.
</p>
<p>Bible. New Testament. John.
The Book of John
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>Bible. German.
Die Heiligen Schriften.
</p>
<p>C. Subarrangement: ALA and Library of
Congress Practice
</p>
<p>The ALA rule [rule 34] for entry of the Bible requires that
subheads be used in the following order: "O. T. [Old Testament] ,
N.T. [New Testament1 ] , the name of the book or group of books, as
the case requires, the language of the text, the date of publication,
and, when known, the version. 11</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>46 - 3
</p>
<p>This rule results in the following typical entries (taken from the
2d edition of the ALA rules) in correct filing order:
</p>
<p>Bible. English. 1611. Authorized.
Bible. O.T. German. 1876.
BiUe. O.T. Apocrypha. English. 1938. Goodspeed.
Bible. O.T. Apocryphal books. 1 Enoch. Ethiopia. 1851,
Bible. O.T. Genesis. English. 1851.
Bible. O.T. Kings. English. 1900.
</p>
<p>[includes 1-2 Kings]
Bible. O.T. 1 Kings. English. 1900.
Bible. O.T. Pentateuch. English. 1904.
Bible. N.T. John. English. 1900.
Bible. N.T. Gospels. Greek. 1896.
</p>
<p>The ALA Filing Rules (rule 28) provide for arrangement first for
</p>
<p>a) Bible manuscripts
b) Bible as a whole
</p>
<p>1) Texts, arranged alphabetically by language, then by
date, and then by version or editor*
</p>
<p>2) BiUe as a whole as subject
c) Bible. Old Testament.
</p>
<p>1) Texts, arranged as in b-1 above
2) Subject.
3) Parts, arranged alphabetically by name of part,
</p>
<p>and under each part
i) Texts by language
ii) Parts as subject
</p>
<p>d) Bible. New Testament (arranged like the Old Testament)
e) Titles, etc. , beginning with the word Bible.
</p>
<p>Filing rules are discussed here because it is the filing arrange-
ment that determines the placement of the words in the author entry.
One cannot begin to establish the author entry until the filing arrange-
ment has been decided upon.
</p>
<p>D. Alternative Subarrangements
</p>
<p>There are three basic principles in the ALA-LC arrangement with
which serious disagreement may be made. First, the premise that
subarrangement by (1) whole Bible, (2) O. T. and (3) N. T. should take
precedence over Ianjua fae- It may be argued first and foremost that
most readers in most libraries would wish to rule out Bibles in langu-
ages other than that in which they are interested. Further, there is
</p>
<p>1 The ALA filing rules suggest that libraries preferring to keep
versions together may do so by arranging first by version or editor and
then by date, but Library of Congress cards are not printed that way.
</p>
<p>or canonically, i.e. arranging the books of the Bible in the order
in which they appear in the King James version.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>46 - 4
</p>
<p>no point in trying to bring together in the catalog all the copies of the
Old Testament, or all separately-published copies of the Gospels or
of Genesis. The bulk of the library's holdings of these parts of the
Bible appear in complete editions of the Bible . The task of bringing
all holdings together in the catalog is therefore impossible. The
Library of Congress practice of making duplicate added entries
represents a vain effort to achieve an impossible goal. If these
arguments are accepted, such ALA headings beginning
</p>
<p>Bible. German
and
</p>
<p>BiULe. Latin
</p>
<p>would remain unchanged, but those beginning
</p>
<p>Bible . O . T . German
and
</p>
<p>Bible. O. T. Chronicles. Latin
</p>
<p>would be changed, so that they would read
</p>
<p>Bible. German. O. T.
and
</p>
<p>Bible. Latin. O. T. Chronicles.
</p>
<p>A second basic difficulty is the use of the word "English" in the
headings. This causes English-language Bibles to be buried after
such headings as Bible. Coptic, and Bible. Dutch. If the word
English is omitted, the dates of English-language Bibles will be next
in line for consideration as filing symbols. If date subdivisions are
allowed to precede alphabetical subdivisions, all English-language
texts will come first in the catalog. These will be followed alpha-
betically by foreign-language versions of the Bible, interfiled with
</p>
<p>subject headings, as shown in the list on page 46- 6. Omission of
the word English is permitted as an alternative by ALA filing rule
29.
</p>
<p>The third basic difficulty of the ALA-LC system is the presump-
tion that date of publication is more important than the date of transla-
tion in most libraries. Dates used in ALA-LC headings are publica-
tion dates, not translation dates. Inclusion of the date of publication
in the heading ahead of the version scatters versions hopelessly,
while at the same time it may separate editions that differ from one
another only in the date on the title-page. It is doubtful if there is
</p>
<p>any value in including publication dates in the headings. However,
a good case can be made for including translation dates (dates of
first publication of any version) in the heading. This will serve to
distinguish versions with names unfamiliar to readers, as shown in
Fig. 46-1.
</p>
<p>Subarrangement by version immediately after the language has
the added value of calling readers
</p>
<p>1 attention to the importance of
selecting the desired version.</p>

foreign-language Bibles, it (or both) may be omitted. If desired,
space may be left so that it may be added later. If the date of
publication of the copy at hand is known, but not the date of original
publication, the date should be omitted from the heading.
</p>
<p>E . Summary of Improvements in Organization

<p>If the three basic objections cited in the preceding section are
held to be valid, the table of arrangement of Bibles would become:</p>

<p>46 - 6
</p>
<p>I. Bibles (English text*)

<p>II . Foreign Bibles and Bible as Subject, arranged
alphabetically.
</p>
<p>III. Bible titles and Bible subject headings phrased
as titles.
</p>

<p>The Decimal classification provides for classification of whole.
Bibles by language, e.g. English Bibles, 220.52; French Bibles,
220.54, German Bibles, 220.53, etc. It is recommended that these
numbers be used only for Bibles in foreign languages, and that Eng-
lish Bibles be classified in 220, without subdivision. Books about
the Bible may be classified in 220.5, and 220.52 may be left unused,
or used for polyglot Bibles. Books about versions of the Bible
should be classed with texts of the version, using appropriate book
numbers.
</p>
<p>Individual books of the Bible have been assigned special classifi-
cation numbers in both the Decimal and Library of Congress classi-
fications .
</p>
<p>H. Versions.
</p>
<p>If known, the version should be indicated in the heading by its
name or by the name of its translator (or place and printer if the
version can be distinguished only in this way). The version should
follow the name of the language. If there are several editions of
the same version, they should be arranged by date of printing. If
some editions have been edited, these may be grouped alphabetically
by editor, following the unedited ones. Printing dates, and editors
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>names may be given in the headings to simplify filing .
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Cutter- type book numbers (greatly
shortened book numbers) may be used to keep together the various
editions of each separate version, e.g.
</p>

</p>
<p>Added entires for distinctive titles and for the names of
translators and editors are useful, "as shown in Fig. 46-4. How-
ever, if the name of the translator is given in the heading itself,
a cross-reference instead of an added entry will eliminate many
added entry cards, if many editions are owned, as shown in Figs.

ferred in case of many cards under Stirling* as

</p>
<p>The Library of Congress uses the following form divisions in
Bible headings:

<p>For the blind.
Lessons, Liturgical.
Manuscripts.
Paraphrase s .
Selections.
Shorthand.
</p>
<p>With the possible exception of the largest religious libraries,
these form divisions are generally most useful when applied ahead
of other subdivisions in Bible headings, rather than after the state-
ment indicating Biblical book, e.g.

<p>Bible. N.T. Mark. English. Revised standard.
For the blind , 1953.
</p>
<p>Someone aiding a blind person in selecting a Braille edition from
the catalog would be practically helpless in the face of entries like
the latter one, which would scatter Braille editions hopelessly
throughout the entire file of cards under Bible. This method is not
recommended, even though it represents Library of Congress prac-
tice. Placing the form division earlier in the heading brings together
all examples of these specialized forms.
</p>
<p>The forms "Paraphrases 11 and "Selections, 11 however, should
follow the names of Biblical books, if it is desired to use these form
divisions, e.g.
</p>
<p>Bible. 1611. Authorized. N.T. Revelation.
Paraphrases. Scher.
</p>
<p>No one is likely to want to see paraphrases to the exclusion of
other versions, so that it is better to use this subdivision following
the names of Biblical books.
</p>
<p>K. Polyglot Bibles
</p>
<p>It is convenient to enter Bibles or parts of Bibles in three or
more languages under the heading Bible. Polyglot.
</p>
<p>BiUe . Polyglot. Authorized .
</p>
<p>If the polyglot edition includes two or more versions or transla-
tions, the statement of version or translation should be omitted from
the heading, e.g.
</p>
<p>Bible. Polyglot.
</p>
<p>Bibles in two languages may easily be entered under the name of
the language that takes alphabetical precedence over the other, with
added entry for the latter.
</p>
<p>Bible. Dutch. 1690. States-general,
with added entry:
I. Bible. German. 1534. Luther.
</p>
<p>L. The Bible as Subject
</p>
<p>According to AJLA-LC practice, subject entries for the Bible
should be divided into three alphabets: (1) works about the Bible
as a whole, e.g. BIBLE--THEOLOGY, (2) works about parts of the
Bible, e.g. BIBLE. O. T. , and (3) subject headings phrased as titles,
e.g. BIBLE AND SCIENCE.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>46- 12
</p>
<p>In addition, a fourth group would consist of works about a
particular version of the Bible, e.g. BIBLE. ENGLISH. 1611.
AUTHORIZED. However, the Library of Congress simply uses
the heading BIBLE--VERSIONS for this type of work. This prac-
tice is a rather flagrant violation of the principle of specific entry,
and is quite inconsistent with LC practice in general.
</p>
<p>The proposed simplifications outlined above for more effective
organization of Bibles and books about the Bible would simplify
filing procedures. The proposals provide for three groups of cards:
(1) English texts (including works about them), (2) foreign Bibles
and subject headings in one alphabet, and (3) titles and title-like
subject headings. In group 2 are to be found the ALA-LC whole-
Bible subject headings as well as their parts -of- the-Bible subject
headings. The filing -sequence shown on page 46-6 illustrates the
proposed filing arrangement for all of these types of headings.
</p>
<p>A little comment on certain LC subject headings seems appro-
priate here.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress subject (form) heading BIBLE (TEXTS,
VERSIONS, ETC. ) is used theoretically (and incredibly) for every
copy of the Bible or part of the Bible owned by the Library of Con-
gress. In actual practice, it seems to be used for all versions
including even the more standard ones. The heading is apparently
designed to solve the problem created by the Library of Congress
when it decided to scatter versions by arranging its Bibles by date
of publication under each language. Use of the heading does not
accomplish any purpose save that of building another conglomera-
tion of unrelated cards under a heading that exists (in a separate
alphabet of its own! ) only to add further confusion to an already
ridiculous arrangement.
</p>
<p>Use of three subject subdivisions should be explained to those
unaware of LC interpretation. These three headings are:
</p>
<p>(1) BIBLE--COMMENTARIES
(2) BIBLE --CRITICISM, INTERPRETATION, ETC.
(3) BIBLE CRITICISM, TEXTUAL
</p>
<p>The heading BIBLE--COMMENTARIES is used for books providing
a more or less running commentary on all or a part of the text of
the Bible. The heading BIBLE- -CRITICISM, INTERPRETATION,
ETC. is used for lengthier or more general interpretations of the
significance or meaning of stories, characters, books, etc. , of the
Bible. The heading is thus used for critical works that do not pro-
vide the "verse by verse 11 type of criticism given in the commentar-
ies. The heading BIBLE- -CRITICISM, TEXTUAL is used for
works devoted to criticism of the manuscript and other sources used
in preparation of Biblical texts, and thus for works dealing with the
authenticity or validity of specific translations or parts of transla-
tions.</p>

</p>
<p>M . Summary
The proposals given above are designed to provide a simpler 9
</p>
<p>more orderly and more useful arrangement of cards under the
heading Bible in library card catalogs. The principal proposals
call for:
</p>
<p>(1) arrangement of English-language texts at the beginning
of the file
</p>
<p>(2) abandonment of efforts to bring together in one place the
texts of separately published parts of the Bible, regard-
less of language or translation
</p>
<p>(3) bringing together all identical translations (versions),
whether complete or of parts of the Bible
</p>
<p>(4) arrangement of foreign-language Bibles in alphabetical
sequence by language within the alphabet of subject
headings
</p>
<p>(5) elimination of the catch-all subject heading BIBLE (TEXTS,
VERSIONS, ETC.)
</p>
<p>(6) provision of cross-references from variant names of
versions
</p>
<p>(7) provision of specific subject headings for books about a
specific version, e.g. BIBLE. 1611. AUTHORIZED,
instead of LC's BIBLE--VERSIONS.

Indexes and Revised Editions
</p>
<p>A. "Copy 11 versus "Edition"
</p>
<p>If a book is not a first printing, is it to be treated as another copy
or cataloged as a different edition? This is one of the most important
questions facing the cataloger. Although the answer may seem obvious
to some, catalogers the nation over disagree. It is an important ques-
tion because of the amount of time that must be spent in cataloging if
it is not considered a "copy 11 . Present American practice is largely
influenced by Library of Congress practice, which is unrealistic from
an economic point of view and, therefore, unsatisfactory.
</p>
<p>The most important thing for the cataloger to realize is that the
popular notions of what constitutes an edition, and the publishers 1
</p>
<p>notions of what constitutes an edition, are not satisfactory definitions
for the purpose of the card catalog. In the book trade, the term "first
edition" -- the collector's item -- really refers to the first printing.
Libraries cannot afford to distinguish between different printings.
The overwhelming majority of all the first printings of the books re-
ceived in American libraries are worth no more than the second print-
ings. From the point of view of the readers in libraries, the important
question about different printings or editions is: is the text identical?
Or, if so, do they have different illustrations? Does one contain a
spetial introduction or foreword? Is one more accurate than the other?
On the other hand, the reader does not care if he gets the edition bound
in red or the one in blue, the one printed on rag paper or the one on
Japanese vellum, the first or the eighteenth printing, so long as the
text is the same. Thus, it is not necessary to describe unimportant
differences of this type. Generally speaking, physical differences are
of little importance to the reader. On the other hand, occasionally,
physical* characteristics do make a difference. Then the differences
should be mentioned, for example if a certain printing is 30 x 20
inches. In the case of books whose users are known to be interested
in such matters, e.g. incunabula, minute differences may be very
important.
</p>
<p>The significance of distinguishing between important and unim-
portant differences lies in the fact that if the differences are unim-
portant they need not be mentioned on the catalog card. If they are
not mentioned on the catalog card, then the same catalog card may
serve for several books even though each book is different in one or
more unimportant respects. This, then, is what the word "copy"
means , from a practical point of view If a newly acquired book
differs from one already in the library only in unimportant respects
it should be treated as a copy , and no new catalog cards will be needed .
</p>
<p>47 - 1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>47 - 2
</p>
<p>However, if there are important differences, the newly acquired book
should be treated as a different edition, and a new set of cards should
be made.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress practice with respect to unimportant
differences is stated in rule 3: 1A. If two issues of a book have dif-
ferent imprint dates, or if the form of name of the publisher is given
in two different ways (provided it is the same publisher), the Library
of Congress is willing to treat the two books as copies. However, if
</p>
<p>any of the other elements of description differs, the Library of Congress
treats the works as different editions. This policy is no doubt satis-
</p>
<p>factory for the Library of Congress, but it results in great expense to
other libraries where it is followed. Use of this policy means that
editions reprinted by a different publisher must always be cataloged
separately. The task of replacing a lost or worn-out book, or even of
</p>
<p>buying more copies for a reserve collection in a college library, fre-
quently results in withdrawing all the cards for the discarded copy,
and the preparation of a new set of cards in their place. Or, at the
very least, the preparation of a new set of cards in addition to the old
ones. The expense of all this is so great that in some libraries the
order librarian, when buying replacement copies, attempts (or is
</p>
<p>urged) to buy the exact edition already in the library, no matter how
much more that edition may cost or how much more difficult it may
be to acquire than a cheap reprint edition. The question of the extent
to which catalogers might ignore differences in reprint editions is
</p>
<p>fully discussed in chapter 49*
</p>
<p>Fortunately, in many libraries, catalogers take a more liberal
view of the word "copy11 than the Library of Congress . If two issues
have the same text, but are published by different publishers, many
-- perhaps most -- catalogers are willing that they be treated as
copies -- with one reservation. That the difference be noted on the
</p>
<p>catalog cardl This necessitates withdrawing the catalog cards, typing

<p>on a statement showing that copy 2 was published in London by Hogarth*
and refiling the cards. Most of the time that was saved by considering
the London printing a copy has now been lost. Does the reader care?
Will he, as a result of this sympathy by the cataloger for his needs,
mark his call slip "copy 2 preferred , vf or Msend copy 1 onlyN ?
</p>
<p>The same practice is also followed by many catalogers for dif-
ferences in imprint date . He*e, if the newly acquired copy is a later
printing, the cataloger may annotate all the cards "Copy 2. 1966".
Encouragement is given this practice by the Library of Congress in
rule 3: 13F. This rule states that "if the [copyright date] is not the
same as the date on the title-page or the actual date of publication, as
supplied, both dates are given." There is nothing wrong with this
rule from the point of view of the first issue of the edition at hand, but
for catalogers who have a later printing at hand, the temptation is great.
If the LC card reads "1946 [c!945]" and the cataloger has the 1948
printing (copyrighted 1945, of course), the temptation to alter the LC
card is hard to resist. For if the card is used without change, the
cataloger is put in the position of lying. On the other hand, it is a
white lie , for the reader will not be inconvenienced, so long as the
imprint date is the only difference in the book. If the library already
has the 1946 printing, there is also the question, can the 1948 printing
be added as copy 2 without noting the difference on the catalog cards?
There are three different answers to this question.
</p>
<p>The cataloger who is willing to compromise may note the different
date on the shelflist card, but not in the catalog.
</p>
<p>For the cataloger with an easy conscience, forget it I
</p>
<p>For the cataloger with an uneasy conscience, and for all catalogers
who really want to solve the problem, don't accept the LC rule. Instead,
adopt the principle (not a rule) that the important thing is to show the
reader how up to date the book is. From this principle, the rule -- if
one must have a rule -- can be drawn that the copyright date shall be
used alone, never giving the printing date on the card when the copy-
right date may be used instead. Exceptions should be made, of course,
whenever necessary to adhere to the basic principle --to fihow how up-
to-date the book is.
</p>
<p>B. Added Copies and Replacements
</p>
<p>The term "added copies 11 is usually used in libraries to refer to
extra copies of a book that is already cataloged. The extra copies
are "added11 to the shelflist card, the call number and ownership marks
placed in the extra copies, and the volumes sent to the shelves. Added
copies thus are subject to a very simple routine. In a well-run library,
they may be handled in a catalog department by members of the clerical
staff, provided that during the acquisition process a person of sound
bibliographic judgment (professional, or experienced and subprofes-
sional) has made the decision that they are copies and not different
editions. Added copies should be examined carefully upon receipt, by
the acquisitions staff, to make certain they are copies and not different
editions.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>47-4
</p>
<p>This person in the acquisitions department should indicate the call
number of the shelflist card to which the copies are to be added. In-
deed, in a properly- administered library, the departments in charge of
</p>
<p>ordering added copies (reserve, circulation, and reference depart-
ments) will be required to supply the call number, so that the acquisi-
tions or cataloging staff need not look it up again.
</p>
<p>In ordering added and replacement copies, certain variations
should be made from the order routine used for new titles. This is
especially important for libraries using multiple-carbon order forms.
The order for Library of Congress cards will, of course, be withheld,
as no new catalog cards will be needed. If the library makes a practice
of filing a temporary slip in the public catalog for books on order (as
many libraries have begun to do in recent years), this slip should be
diverted to the shelflist in the case of added copies and replacements.
The shelflist is the record which is supposed to show the number of
copies of books in the library and on order. This temporary shelflist
slip is removed tit the time the book, after being received, is "added"
to the shelflist. To simplify this filing, and to expedite other aspects
of the handling process, the call number should be typed onto multiple
order forms for added copies.
</p>
<p>In most libraries, the number of copies owned is shown only on the
shelflist cards, and not on the catalog cards. In some libraries, how-
ever, the number of copies is shown on all the catalog cards. In some
libraries, it is shown on main cards only. In others, the number of
copies owned at the time of cataloging is shown, but later additions are
recorded only in the shelflistl There is no denying that persons not on
the staff occasionally need to know how many copies are available, e.g.
instructors considering placing books on reserve, but whether this oc-
casional use warrants such an expensive practice must be carefully
considered. The practice of showing the number of copies on any
cards other than shelflist cards is not recommended.
</p>
<p>C . Added Volumes and Serial Records
</p>
<p>The term "added volumes" is usually used in libraries to refer to
new volumes being added to sets of serial publications that are already
cataloged (cf. chapters 27 and 31). Thus if the library has a standing
order for the World Almanac, the current volume is handled as an
"added volume" between the time it is received by the acquisitions
staff and the time it is placed in its proper place on the shelves.
Presumably the set was cataloged many years previously. No new
catalog cards need to be made. All that is necessary, after opening
the package containing the new World Almanac , is to record the fact
that it has been received. This is done so that bills may be paid,
inventory taken, and persons told whether or not it is owned, if they
should ask or need to know. It is then necessary only to send it to
the shelves with its call number.
</p>
<p>(2)
</p>
<p>These two steps, (1) recording the receipt of added volumes, and
sending them to the shelve s.are the basic steps in handling all</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>47-5
</p>
<p>types of serials in all libraries. Some of the most complex records
known to man have been established in some libraries in order to
satisfy these two simple requirements. In a large library, elaborate
serial records and serials departments have been established for
these purposes. These are quite necessary and often are operated
very efficiently. Nevertheless, librarians should not forget the basic
simplicity of purpose .
</p>
<p>Since receipt must be recorded promptly, and since the library's
book dealer is not usually expected to supply the call number on the
package (though this is possible), librarians usually maintain an
alphabetical serials record. This is useful for a variety of purposes,
for keeping track of subscriptions, for claiming, etc. One of its
prime purposes, however, is to supply the call number so that it can
be lettered on the volume and the volume sent to the shelves. At the
same time, receipt of the volume can be recorded on this alphabetical
record. In some libraries it is the only serial record. This is the
simplest of all serial records. One record, one operation. It is used
in some of the smallest and some of the largest libraries. It has its
disadvantages .
</p>
<p>D . Recording Holdings in the Card Catalog
</p>
<p>For one thing, the single serial record method operates too
independently of the card catalog to suit many librarians. In the
simplest situation, the serials need not even be cataloged. Indeed,
they need not even be given call numbers but may be shelved alpha*
betically instead. Without complicating the actual "adding11 procedure,
however, the serials may be fully cataloged. In such a case, all the
cards would read "For volumes in the library, consult the serial
record. 11 Thus, once the set is cataloged, additions to the set may
be made without making any further record in the catalog itself.
</p>
<p>This method is not as convenient for readers as when holdings
are shown in the catalog. Therefore, in many libraries, serials are
recorded in both the serial record and the card catalog. Practices
differ widely. Some librarians feel that reader convenience out-
weighs economy, and therefore show complete holdings on all cards.
Near the other extreme, other librarians show incomplete holdings
on main cards only. The following "degrees 11 of showing holdings are
given in the order of simplicity and labor cost:
</p>
<p>(1) Serials are not recorded or listed in any way in the card
catalog .
</p>
<p>(2) Holdings at the time of cataloging only are shown on all
cards. Cards are stamped "For additions, see serial
record."
</p>
<p>(3) The earliest owned volume is shown only on the main card,
with the statement "Library has [from this volume] to date.
</p>
<p>91
</p>
<p>Other cards are stamped "For holdings, see card under</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>47 - 6
</p>
<p>[title]
11
</p>
<p>. Gaps (except very recent ones, which are still
expected to be filled) are shown on the main card.
</p>
<p>(4) The earliest owned volume is shown on all cards , with the
statement "Library has [ from this volume] to date. 11
</p>
<p>Gaps (except very recent ones) are shown on all cards.
</p>
<p>(5) The earliest and latest owned volumes are shown only on
the main card, with the statement (when applicable)
"Current numbers available in [Periodical Room] "
Other cards are stamped "For holdings, see card under
[ title]
</p>
<p>" Gaps are shown on the main card.
</p>
<p>(6) The earliest and latest owned volumes are shown on all
cards, with the statement (when applicable) "Current
numbers available in [ Periodical Room] " Gaps are
shown on all cards.
</p>
<p>Slight variations in wording and procedure occur from library to
library. However, the practice in almost any library will conform
fairly closely to one of the above patterns. A strong argument can be
made for providing for title, subject and "sponsor" cataloging for
periodicals, so that procedure no. 1 is not recommended. On the
other hand, the expense of recording each volume on each catalog
card one or more times a year is so great that procedure no. 6 can
hardly be recommended either. Readers suffer some inconvenience
with procedure no. 3, more with no. 2, and still more with no. 1.
</p>
<p>E. Recording Holdings in the SheLQ1st
</p>
<p>In most libraries, added volumes are recorded also in the shelf-
list after having been recorded in the serial record. Some librarians
like to have this duplicate record as a double check on accuracy.
Some need the shelflist record in order to be able to take inventory
more efficiently. Some confine the serial record to "current" titles,
transferring all records for "dead" or discontinued serials to the
shelflist. Some keep current records (recent holdings) in the alpha-
betical serial record, transferring them in condensed form to the
shelflist every time a serial record card is filled up. Some librarians
record only bound volumes in the shelflist. However, older unbound
issues should be recorded in the shelflist as an aid at inventory time,
and so that the shelflist can also answer questions pertaining to hold-
ings. If older unbound issues are not to be recorded in the shelflist,
logic dictates that bound volumes of serials should not be recorded
there either .
</p>
<p>F. Traveling Cards
</p>
<p>How is all this recording undertaken? In the serial record, the
clerk generally records receipt of an added volume from the volume
itself. That is, the volume is sent to the serial record files, the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>47 - 7
</p>
<p>clerk looks at the title on the volume, finds the card, records the
volume number, or year (or whatever), writes the call number in
the volume, and forwards it to be lettered on the spine, or
shelved, or sent to the bindery, etc. These procedures vary from
library to library, and are discussed fully in the articles cited in
the bibliography for this chapter. The important fact here is that --
at the serial record -- the recording is nearly always done from the
volume itself.
</p>
<p>The serial record may or may not be maintained by the catalog
department. In many libraries it is a part of the acquisitions de-
partment. In larger libraries it may be operated by a special serials
department. In some libraries, there are two or more serial re-
cords -- one for periodicals, one for continuations, one for govern-
ment serials, etc. In all libraries, however, the shelflist and the
card catalog are maintained by the catalog department. If serials
are to be recorded in these two files, how is it to be accomplished?
Should the books themselves be sent from the serial record to the
shelflist, recorded there, and then sent to the card catalog, and
recorded there? In some libraries, this cumbersome method is
followed. Its disadvantages stem from having to handle the books.
Recording from the books means opening and shutting them, lifting
them, arranging them numerically for the shelflist and then alpha-
betically for the card catalog, finding a place to put them, and keep-
ing them out of circulation.
</p>
<p>Most libraries have simplified matters by using what is commonly
called a traveling card . Although traveling cards differ from library
to library, they operate on the same principle. Essentially, the
traveling card is a duplicate copy of the card kept in the serial record,
although it is often of a smaller size and different format. The
traveling card is normally kept (when it is not traveling) in the serial
record, side by side with the serial record card. When a new volume
comes in, it is entered on the serial record card and also on the
traveling card. Then the volume is sent to the shelves (or if to the
bindery, the traveling card may be used as a bindery charge, and
then sent "traveling
</p>
<p>11 when the volume is returned from the bindery).
While the volume is on its way directly to the shelves, the traveling
card will be sent to the shelflist, where the volume will be recorded.
The traveling card then goes to the card catalog (if holdings are to be
recorded there), and the volume is again recorded.
</p>
<p>In some libraries, accession numbers are recorded in the shelf-
list. Room is sometimes provided on the traveling card for accession
numbers (if volumes are accessioned before being recorded in the
serial record). Or the volumes go to the shelflist, and the traveling
card begins its rounds here.
</p>
<p>If the library uses a "library has ... to date 11 statement on its
</p>
<p>catalog cards, the traveling card travels only between the serial
record and shelflist, or is not used at all.
</p>
<p>Traveling cards may also be used to record receipt of volumes</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>in the ''analysis file/
1 a file used to record the preparation of sets of
</p>
<p>analytic catalog cards for monographs issued in series. These cards
are usually received on standing order from the Library of Congress.
It is important for the person in charge of preparing these analytical
entries to know whether or not the monographs have been received.
Yet he need not actually see the volumes (cf. chapter 36).
</p>
<p>In some university libraries* traveling cards are used to record
holdings in the catalogs and shelflists of departmental collections.
</p>
<p>Some traveling cards are duplicates of serial record cards not
only in point of information carried, but in actual format, though such
</p>
<p>great similarity has drawbacks. If the library uses a "visible
11 serial
</p>
<p>record, the cards in it are usually 4 x 6 or 5 x 8 , whereas the traveling
cards used may still be 3 x 5. Most modern visible files contain special
pockets which will hold a 3 x 5 traveling card facing each serial record
card.
</p>
<p>In some libraries, if a new volume is received at the serial record
before the traveling card has come back, the volume may be held unre-
corded until the traveling card returns. A better solution is to record
the volume, and flag the serial record card conspicuously so that the
</p>
<p>entry can be made on the traveling card as soon as it returns. Another
common solution is simply to make a duplicate or temporary traveling
card.
</p>
<p>Traveling cards are great time -savers because they are so easily
arranged and handled, and because they free the volumes for prompt
use by readers. The sample shown as Fig. 47-2 is only one of many
designs in use.

</p>
<p>card catalog. Vols. 2-4 were then bound and recorded in
the shelflist. Vole. 6-7 are still unbound and are there-
fore not recorded in the shelflist. Vol. 8 has just been
received f and the traveling card is on its way to the card
catalog and analysis file, in each of which arrival of the
volume will be recorded. Vols. 6, 7 and 8 will not be
recorded in the shelflist until bound. If the set were not
analyzed, column A would not be used.
</p>
<p>In a system using traveling cards, it is important that changes of
title ,sf&gt;OttsoT .author, series, etc., be called to the attention of the
</p>
<p>catalog department, so that necessary alterations, or additional
cards, may be made for the card catalog. For this reason, some
catalogers feel strongly that the added volumes themselves should
come as far as the shelflist, with traveling cards being used beyond
that point. Other librarians have tried to solve this problem by
filing a copy of the catalog card in the serial record. For terminal
continuations and certain others, it is often satisfactory to use a copy
of the catalog card as a traveling card.
</p>
<p>G. Terminal Continuations
</p>
<p>One of the important problems of the catalog department is the
so-called "terminal continuation 11 , "incomplete separate 11 , or "sub-
scription book11 , as it is sometimes called. This is the work *
the publisher issues serially until it is completed. It differs from
the ordinary serial in that it has a definite end in sight. Any work
issued in more than one volume, serially, and with a planned con-
clusion, falls into this category. Many two- volume works are issued
in this way. The present text- book was issued this way.
</p>
<p>The problem to the catalog department is three-fold: (1) the
first volume must be cataloged as an open entry, (2) the succeeding
volumes must be obtained and added to the cards, and (3) someone
must decide when the set has been completed, so that the entry may
be closed permanently. Since the last point is frequently almost im-
possible to determine, many such entries are never permanently (on
the typewriter) closed. Probably no harm is done.
</p>
<p>Terminal continuations suffer because dealers forget to send the
remaining volumes, and because many librarians are reluctant to
place a standing order for a two- or three-volume set. As a result,
the other volumes are never received, and the catalog department is
</p>
<p>plagued with an open entry, about which there will be many questions.
</p>
<p>The only systematic way to treat terminal continuations is to
handle them in the serial record like all other serials. This applies
whether it is a two-volume set or a set issued in a considerably
larger number of parts. It applies whether the main entry is under
the name of an individual person, under title, or under the name of a
sponsoring organisation. Follow-up (claiming) may thus be under-
taken systematically as a part of the routine work at the serial record.</p>

<p>H. Other Editions
</p>
<p>The term "other edition 11 is used here to mean any edition so
different from an edition already in the library that it cannot be
considered a copy. Thus, the term would include books with text-
ual revision, or books with special illustrations, or special forewords,
notes, etc.
</p>
<p>These "other editions 11 will require their own catalog cards. They
may not, therefore, pass through the catalog department with the
promptness of added copies and volumes. If not, what special pro-
cedures need be accorded them?
</p>
<p>One most important consideration is that different editions of the
same title should be accorded the same cataloging treatment. At the
very least, they should not be given different treatment.</p>

<p>Fig. 47-4. Order Card Providing Space for Economical
Reporting of Maximum Information of Interest
to Catalogers
</p>
<p>Thus, if the first edition of a book is given the subject headingELECTRIC LIGHTING- -WIRING, the second edition ought not to be
given the heading ELECTRIC WIRING, INTERIOR, on the ground that
the reader looking under the former heading has the right to expect
that the latest edition will be found under that heading, if the library
owns it.
</p>
<p>The same reasoning applies to the classification process. The
reader who, in browsing, finds a life of Beethoven in class B will be
annoyed to discover a revised edition in class 780.92. Fortunately
for the librarian, he is not likely to discover it!</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>47 - 12
</p>
<p>To prevent such inconsistencies, many catalog departments re-
quest the acquisitions staff to report call numbers of other editions
on order cards. This can be done easily at the time when the acquisi-
tions staff is searching the card catalog to prevent duplicate orders.
In some libraries, the searchers even report added and subject entries
</p>
<p>~
</p>
<p>for editions already in the library. A sample order card providing space
for reporting this type of information is reproduced as Fig. 47-4. This
will save the cataloger a trip to the catalog, or permit the cataloging to
be undertaken at a subprofessional level.
</p>
<p>In many libraries , it is the policy to display only the latest edition
under added and subject entries. A full set 'of cards is made for the latest
edition. The unit cards under added and subject entries are stamped
"For earlier editions see under author. 11 The added and subject entries
for the earlier editions are then withdrawn. If they are withdrawn just
before the new edition is cataloged, they may be used to suggest a
classification number and added entries for the new edition. However,
a simpler procedure has much to commend it. This is to withdraw the
added and subject entries at the time the cards for the later edition are
</p>
<p>being filed. The stamp "For earlier editions, see under author 11 serves
as a flag to trigger the withdrawal of the older cards. Some libraries
file subject entries chronologically by publication date. In these
Iibrarie8 9 withdrawal of the older subject entries is not a particularly
serious problem.
</p>
<p>Some libraries follow the opposite practice of making a full set of
cards for the earliest edition, with the note "For later [or other] edi-
tions see under author" stamped on added entry and subject cards for
later editions This practice is recommended for works of the ixnagin-
ation, but is to be deplored for non- fiction. In the case of non- fiction,
readers should be shown, under subject headings, the cards for the
latest edition, not just the earliest.
</p>
<p>In the case of books frequently revised, the cataloger may prefer
to treat the work as a continuation, as shown in Fig. 47-5. The ac-
quisitions staff should be asked to handle such titles through the serial
record. This procedure is particularly useful for titles of which only
the latest edition is kept in the library, as shown in Fig. 47-6.</p>

<p>I. Supplements
</p>
<p>Supplements to books are similar to revised editions in that they
usually require the same added and subject entries. Their titles are
usually the same as that of the work being supplemented. For these
reasons , they are usually added to the catalog cards for the main work.
The technique is that of making a "library ditto 11 mark (a double-
length dash) for the author, another for the title, and continuing then
with the entry is shown in Fig. 47-7. This technique is colloquially
known to catalogers as the method of "dashing- on11 supplements.

</p>
<p>If the tracings for the original work were made on the back of the
main card, they can be left there . If on the front, they frequently
stand in the way of the dashed-on entry, and the card must be done
over.
</p>
<p>Many librarians prefer to prepare entirely new cards in any
recataloging operation, allowing the new cards to displace the old
ones when filed. They feel that this method is cheaper than removing
and altering the old cards. It also has the advantage of not keeping
important cards out of the catalog. If the shelflist card or a fresh
card (instead of the main card) is used as copy for preparing the new
cards, this method also saves the trouble of preparing a dummy card
to indicate that the main card has been withdrawn.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress revises and reprints its catalog cards to
dash- on supplements fairly promptly after they have been published.
Thus many librarians simply note the supplement on the shelflist card,
send the supplement to the shelves and at the same time order a new
set of LC cards. The supplement is then not noted in the card catalog
until the revised LC cards are received. Other librarians feel that
they can dash the supplements on more economically by doing it
locally.
</p>
<p>This method of dashing-on supplements was at one time widely used
by American librarians for handling revised editions. Thus, a single
catalog card might show as many as three or four successive editions
of one title. This method is still used in some libraries. It is not re-
commended.
</p>
<p>J . Indexes
</p>
<p>Indexes to books, periodicals and other continuations are custom-
arily not mentioned on catalog cards unless they cover more than one
volume. In some libraries, indexes are dashed on like supplements.
In others, separate cards are made (see Fig. 47-8). In others
(notably the Library of Congress), a conventional note is used, such
as that shown in Fig. 47-9- This aeems to be the simplest and most
satisfactory method. The method shown in Fig. 47-8 is desirable if
the library does not own the work that has been indexed.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 48
</p>
<p>Bound-With s
</p>
<p>Two or more books, previously available separately, and now bound
into one volume, constitute the class of works known to librarians as
"bound-withs." Three types of bound-withs may be encountered in
libraries:
</p>
<p>(A) Two or more works published in one volume, with a single
comprehensive title-page. This type of publication is fairly
uncommon.
</p>
<p>(B) Two or more works published independently, but later caused
to be bound together by a librarian, bookseller or private
collector .
</p>
<p>(C) Two or more works published in one volume, without a single
comprehensive title-page, but with a separate title-page for
each work. This type of publication is also uncommon.
</p>
<p>A. Works with a Comprehensive Title-Page
</p>
<p>The problem presented by this type of work can be solved without
recourse to the special techniques described in this chapter. Since
all the works in the volume are presumably named on the title -page,
a single unit card will suffice, with added entries for each author and
title, and appropriate subject entries. The main entry may be made
under author if all the works were written by the same author. See
Fig. 48-1. Otherwise it may be prepared under editor, or under the
comprehensive title, if any. If there is no comprehensive title on the
</p>
<p>title-page, and only the individual titles are listed, a title main entry,
under the first-named title on the title-page, may be prepared.
</p>
<p>If the cataloger desires, each work may be cataloged separately,
as analytics, with the comprehensive title-page serving as a kind of
series note. Under this procedure, no unit cards covering the com-
prehensive title-page would be made. Either a special card listing
the analytics would be made for the shelflist, or else a separate unit
card for each analytic would be filed there.

Published Together in One Volume
</p>
<p>B. Independent Works Bound Together After
Publication
</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century and in earlier times, it was quite
customary, particularly for private book collectors, to bind two or
more volumes together. Such action was economical of binding
expenses, and prevented the clutter caused by an accumulation of
pamphlets . It was principally the result of the fact that most books
were issued in unbound form, and buyers were expected to select
bindings of their own choice . *
</p>
<p>The high cost of binding now discourages private citizens from
having paper-bound books put into hard covers. Librarians are de-
terred from binding books together for several reasons:
</p>
<p>(a) cataloging costs resulting from the problems with which
this chapter deals
</p>
<p>(b) decreased availability of copies (the titles, if inde-
pendently bound, are less frequently found to be already
in circulation when demanded by readers)
</p>
<p>(c) obsolete pamphlets or books cannot be "weeded 11 if bound
with books not obsolete .
</p>
<p>Thus, the bound-with of this category is less and less frequently
encountered in libraries today. However, the problems of the bound-
with are met with in phonograph record cataloging on a scale as never</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>48-3
</p>
<p>previously encountered in the case of books, owing to the practice of
tnH nuking more than one composition on a single record.
</p>
<p>Several works bound together after publication must be cataloged
as separate works 9 unless the cataloger wishes to supply a title-page,
</p>
<p>If the works are cataloged separately, a note may be placed on
each catalog card explaining the relationship to the other works, as
shown in Fig. 48-2.

</p>

</p>
<p>The form of the note should be varied to fit the needs of the
situation. For example:
</p>
<p>Bound with the author's Happy kingdom .
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>Bound with Johnson, Albert F. Mathematics simplified .
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>Bound with: Isaacs, Henry F. Hamsters for profit; and
Peshkov, Robert I. Healthy pets.
</p>
<p>For economy, when more than two works are bound together,
many cataloger s name all the works bound together on the unit card
for the first work only. On the unit cards for the other works, only
the author and title of the first work in the volume need be given.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>48 - 4
</p>
<p>Still simpler is the practice of not naming any of the works on the
cards for the others. However, to protect the tracings and to explain
the situation t a brief note similar to the following should be used.
</p>
<p>Bound with other pamphlets.
</p>
<p>An example of the use of this type of note is shown as Fig . 48-3.

</p>
<p>Fig. 48-3. Card Showing Practice of Not Naming
Bound-With s on Each Unit Card
</p>
<p>When using this very simplified type of note, one of several
alternatives xnuat be followed in order to locate all the cards. (1)
The author card for each work should be traced on the main card
for the first work in the volume, or, (2) a copy of the main entry
card for each work in the volume should stand in the shelflist. The
note "Bound with other publications 11 thus helps to explain why (1)
tracings have been made for authors not named in the body of the
card, or (2) why several cards with the same call number are in
the shelflist.
</p>
<p>If the cataloger wishes to avoid the preparation of main cards
for each of the publications bound together, he may prepare a
special comprehensive title-page for tipping into the volume. A
single main entry, with appropriate added and subject entries for
the individual works, may then be prepared. In the interests of
bibliographical honesty and accuracy, the action should be explained
in a note, as shown in Fig. 48-4. The actual preparation of the
title-page is, of course, a formality. It could be dispensed with
without altering the cataloging technique.</p>

</p>
<p>Bound-withs issued as such by the publishers may be treated
like those described above, i.e. like those bound together following
publication. In such cases, it is customary (e.g. at the Library of
</p>
<p>Congress) to indicate that the works were issued together:
</p>
<p>Bound with (as issued) the author's Happy kingdom .
</p>
<p>Bound with, as issued: Johnson, Albert F. Mathematics
simplified .
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress distinguishes works issued together in
paper covers from those issued together in cloth covers , e.g.
</p>
<p>With; as issued, (instead of: Bound with, as issued,)
</p>
<p>The implication is that if issued together in paper covers, the works
are not bound. Apparently, at the Library of Congress, therefore,
the term "binding 11 refers to hard covers. If one considers that
</p>
<p>stitching is a form of binding, then no distinction need be made.
The Library of Congress practice implies recataloging if the volume
is ever put into hard covers.</p>

<p>D . Clas sific ation
</p>
<p>A classification policy that places bound-withs under the most
specific class number common to all of the titles in the volume is, at
least theoretically, the most useful from a reader's standpoint. Thus,
the pamphlets
</p>
<p>Electric measurements (621.37)
Home electrical repairs (621.328)
and
</p>
<p>Electric cables (621.3193)
</p>
<p>if bound together, should be classed in 621.3 or 621.308. This practice
is especially to be commended for three or more pamphlets bound to-
gether. However, it is common practice for librarians to classify the
volumes according to the requirements of the first book or pamphlet
in the volume, with a book number based on its author's name . If the
class number is a general one, the book number may be based on the
name of the author of the first pamphlet (if there is no comprehensive
title-page) even if the class number was not. In case of a comprehen-
sive title-page, the book number may be based on the main entry
covering the entire volume.
</p>
<p>E. Collections of Pamphlets
</p>
<p>Some libraries still save considerable binding money by binding
pamphlets on broad general subjects into loose-leaf pamphlet binders.
In such cases, a simple note is added to the cards, e.g.
</p>
<p>Bound with other pamphlets.
</p>
<p>Such collections are handled much like monographs in series, except
that the equivalent of the "series card' 1 is allowed to collect in the
shelflist, simply by filing one card for each pamphlet there. v
</p>
<p>Broad classification numbers are usually assigned using a Cutter- type
number standing for the word "pamphlet", or perhaps a Mann-type
book number (cf. chapter 31), e.g.
</p>
<p>780.8 Pamphlets on music
P2
</p>
<p>780.8 Mersmann, Hans, 1891-
P2 Neue Musik in der StrOmungen unserer Zeit.
no. 7
</p>
<p>OR (using Mann- type book numbers)
621 .3 Pamphlets on electrical engineering
A08p
</p>
<p>621.3 Eliovici, Albert
</p>
<p>A08p Lejons sur les essais de machines lectriques
no. 5 \ courant continu.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>48-7
</p>
<p>The pamphlet number* are, of course, arbitrarily assigned. Their
purpose is to locate the specific pamphlet even though the collection
may ultimately be bound into many volumes. Assignment of an in-
dividual number to the pamphlet instead of assigning a volume number
to a group of pamphlets has the advantages of (1) simplifying location
of the pamphlet within the volume, (2) eliminating the necessity of
predicting how many pamphlets will make a volume, and (3) main-
taining an orderly arrangement of cards in the shelflist. The note
HBound with other pamphlets'1 is useful because it helps to explain to
readers and staff the mystery of the otherwise unexplained pamphlet
number in the call number.
</p>
<p>Class numbers broader than two figures of the Decimal classifica-
tion should not be used, as withdrawal of pamphlets for addition to
newly created departmental collections or branches becomes a problem
in such cases. Thus a collection of pamphlets classed as 308 P2 be-
comes a problem if an Education Library is established, and the set
might conceivably have to be broken up if education materials included
in it are to be taken out of the main library. In determining the length
of the class number, the form division "08" should not be counted, of
course .

<p>CHAPTER 49
</p>
<p>Reprint Editions
</p>
<p>We have seen that most of the items of information on the catalog
card are placed there for the benefit of the reader using the subject
approach, who does not know which particular book he wants, and who
wishes to choose among the available books on that subject. We have
made efforts to describe each book in order to point out certain char-
acteristics useful in its evaluation, as, for example, place and date of
publication, and name of publisher. We have decided, for example,
that it is generally better to show on the card its copyright date , rather
than its printing date . We decided this on the grounds that the copyright
date is usually a better guide to the actual up-to-dateness of the text
than is the date of printing.
</p>
<p>It is of prime importance to distinguish, therefore, information
that is helpful to the reader in making his choice, e.g. copyright date,
from information that is misleading, e.g. printing date. It is equally
important to recognize and distinguish (by omission) information that
is valueless to the reader.
</p>
<p>It is in cataloging the class of books known as reprint editions,
i.e. editions other than the original one, that opportunities for helping
the reader by omitting unimportant information arise. That these op-
portunities may also simplify the task of the cataloger is an added
blessing.
</p>
<p>A . Unimportant D etails
</p>
<p>Beyond misleading imprint dates, reprint editions have other mis-
leading or valueless characteristics differing from those of the original
edition. Among these may be (1) different place of publication, (2)
different publisher, (3) different pagination or number of volumes, (4)
different size, (5) different location (with reference to page numbers)
of certain bibliographical information, i.e. bibliographies and other
</p>
<p>appendixes, (6) different series note, etc. Some or all of these super-
ficial differences may characterize any two editions of the same book,
even though the text and illustrations are identical.
</p>
<p>Many librarians have recognized that these differences are of no
concern to the great majority of readers. To catalog separately, say,
the two editions of Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter published by the Riverside
</p>
<p>Library and Everyman's Library ; (even though the pagination and print-
ing dates are different), is a wast^ of cataloging time and money. It is
also something of an inconvenience to both readers. Recognizing the
</p>
<p>unimportance of these details--except in the case of rare books-- some
librarians feel that readers need not be informed of them. Let us pursue

<p>49 - 3
</p>
<p>Some bolder librarians have simply added the reprint edition as
a second copy without making any note at all. Other more biblio-
graphically conservative ones have felt that it is all right to treat the
other reprint as a second copy, but that it should be fully described,
as shown in Fig. 49-2. This method is so cumbersome and expensive
that it is probably easier to make separate main cards for each edi-
tion. It is not recommended.
</p>
<p>B. Important Details
</p>
<p>The more valueless information added to the catalog cards, the
less time the catalogers will have for other more important duties.
Thus, care in the exercise of the cataloger's judgment is necessary.
For example, some will complain that the Everyman edition should be
so described, for many readers will not want it because of its fine
print. In a library with an open stack, where the readers may browse,
this objection may be less important. In a closed stack library, cata-
loging reprint editions separately will often result in readers being
informed that the desired volume is out, when an identical text may
be available under a slightly different call number. Clerks do not
always remember to supply substitute editions when they have different
call numbers.
</p>
<p>It is, of course, important to remember that reprint editions in-
corporating special features may be worth cataloging separately, es-
pecially if Library of Congress cards are available. The Modern
Library series is typical of a number of reprint series printed with
introductions by famous people. However, the catalogcr should not
over-estimate the importance of these introductions. Many librarians
believe that few persons read prefaces, especially to classics. Deci-
sions in such cases will depend upon the type of library and clientele,
press of other duties, etc. Failure to mention on the catalog card the
fact of a foreword or preface does not prevent the reader from dis-
covering it when he opens the book. On the other hand, he may not
know of the availability of such a preface if the reprint edition contain-
ing it is not cataloged as a separate edition.
</p>
<p>Among certain differences of greater importance than those named
above may be included (1) different translations, (2) different illus-
trations, or the presence or lack of illustrations, (3) absence or
presence of different bibliographical features, such as bibliographies
or notes, (4) changes in actual text, (5) important differences in print
size, (6) abridgment or expurgation, etc.
</p>
<p>C . Cataloging in Terms of the Original Edition
</p>
<p>Among the characteristics not normally described when reprint
editions are conventionally cataloged are (1) date and place of original
publication, (2) original publisher, (3) original title and series, etc.
</p>
<p>Particularly in the case of non-fiction, this information may be ex-
tremely valuable to readers trying to select books under a subject</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>heading. Even in the case of reprints f it in probably more useful
for readers to know about the characteristics of the original edition
than to know about those of the reprint.

</p>
<p>In such cases paging and volumes should be omitted, and the illus-
trative matter and original series note, if any, should appear in the
imprint or body of the card. Bibliographical notes should be given in
</p>
<p>general descriptive terms, avoiding references to specific pagination,
so that cards will not be misleading if a later and different reprint
edition should be acquired, e.g. "Contains bibliography", rather than
11Bibliography: p.410-458M . Series notes should be given for the
</p>
<p>original publication, and series entry made if necessary or desirable.
Details of original publication may be omitted if not easily ascer-
tained from such sources as the Library of Congress printed catalogs,
the Cumulative Book Index, the United States Catalog series, Bessie
Graham's Bookman's Manual, etc.
</p>
<p>Many librarians have scruples against adding, as copies, books
that do not "match" the catalog cards. These librarians are the same
ones who find it uneconomical to buy paper-covered reprint editions
because of the expense of cataloging them. It is indeed true that edi-
tions costing less than a dollar are hardly worth the cost of separate
cataloging. If, however, cataloging of the type shown in Figs. 49-3
and 49-4 (or 49-1) is used, the library will get the most for its money,
and paper-covered books, even though they may wear out after a few
circulations, may become economically feasible.
</p>
<p>Many librarians do not hesitate to use L.C cards describing the
first edition, without change or annotation, for various reprint editions</p>

<p>For books not believed to be scarce or rare for any reason,
cataloging in terms of the original edition is -recommended for most
libraries, large and small, whether the library owns the original
edition or not.
</p>
<p>D . Purpose of Reprint- cataloging Shortcuts
</p>
<p>The argument has been made that only small libraries may take
such bibliographical liberties. But the larger the library, the more
money it may waste on bibliographical extravagances. Catalogers
must distinguish between the bibliographical importance of a first
edition of Shakespeare and one of Mickey Spillane. If catalogers can
</p>
<p>generalize between rare books and ordinary ones, reprint editions
</p>
<p>present unusual opportunities for (1) saving cataloging costs for
</p>
<p>reprints added to the library or used as extra copies or replace-
ments, (2) furnishing readers with an identical text even when the
</p>
<p>printing they called for is in circulation, (3) speeding replacement
of lost or worn-out volumes, and (4) making practicable, in terms
of cataloging costs, the use of inexpensive editions as replacement
copies .</p>

</p>
<p>Punched Card Catalogs
</p>
<p>A. History
</p>
<p>The mechanical preparation of library catalogs through the use
of punched cards was predicted as early as 1938,** Experimental
work was begun at the Library of Congress in 1946. Probably the
first successful non- experimental punched- card catalog of periodi-
cals was Serial Titles Newly Received, published by the Library of
Congress beginning in 1950, now called New Serial Titles. The first
non-experimental punched- card catalogs of books are believed to be
the branch library catalogs of the King County (Washington, ) Public
Library system * These catalogs were first distributed in 1951 .
More recently (1956), the New York State Library has begun publica-
tion of a mechanically prepared catalog that will eventually list its
entire collection The first volume, Checklist of Books and Pamphlets
in the Social Sciences, was issued in May of 1956. This catalog, which
lists approximately 45,000 titles,, was distributed to all public and
institutional libraries in the state of New York.
</p>
<p>B . The Future of Punched Card Catalogs
</p>
<p>It appears that the future of machine-prepared catalogs is bright.
No doubt other state library systems will soon follow in the steps of
the New York State Library Other public library systems are al-
ready experimenting with the use of punched card equipment for
branch library catalogs similar to those of the King County Public
Library. The day is not far off when every college professor may
have his own copy of the library's catalog. The presence in every
departmental library of a complete catalog of the holdings of an entire
university library system will no doubt lead to the installation of
pneumatic tubes for speedy delivery of books to any campus location,
solving at last the problem of centralization vs. decentralization of
the university library system.

</p>
<p>C. Advantages of Punched Card Catalogs
</p>
<p>The great advantage of punched card catalogs lies in the fact that
multiple copies of the catalog can be produced inexpensively. How-
ever, they provide other outstanding advantages. Once the catalog
is printed (or mimeographed, or multilithed) , the punched cards re-
main intact for use in future revised editions of the catalog. New
cards are added easily, and old ones can be withdrawn quickly when
books are discarded.
</p>
<p>In the days -- fifty to a hundred years ago -- when most libraries
had their catalogs printed, they found it advantageous to let the type
stand, so that it would not have to be reset for future editions. How-
ever, they could not afford the cost of tying up such large quantities
of lead in the printing office. Nor could they find an easy method of
inserting alphabetically, and in the proper places, lead slugs for the
titles of new books. Further, the printers did not usually have the
space for storing large quantities of type. Only the H.W . Wilson
Company has found the solution to these problems, and it has not
encouraged libraries to print their catalogs according to its methods.
</p>
<p>The IBM (International Business Machines) or Remington-Rand
punched card solves all of these problems. It is cheap and takes little
more space than a catalog card. To prepare a new edition of a punched
card catalog, one merely files the cards for new titles into the existing
file, and removes the cards for titles that have been withdrawn.
</p>
<p>The cards can be punched almost as fast as conventional catalog
cards can be typed, and by the same typist. Copy for the key-punch
operator is prepared by the cataloger in a manner similar to the
preparation of ordinary cataloging copy. The cataloger can learn
easily the few details of machine operation he needs to know in order
to understand the problems of the machine operator. The cataloger
himself will rarely come into direct contact with the machines.
</p>
<p>\
</p>
<p>The filing of the cards can be done by hand almost as fast as
conventional catalog cards can be filed by a clerk, and even faster
if a sorting machine is employed. In certain types of catalogs,
particularly author catalogs, filing by hand is faster than machine
filing.
</p>
<p>D. Methodology of Punched Card Catalogs
</p>
<p>The punched card catalog is produced by the following steps:
</p>
<p>(1) determination and acceptance of limitations imposed by the
machines ,
</p>
<p>(2) establishment of a pattern governing the placement of
information on the punched card,
</p>
<p>(3) preparation (key-punching) of cards for the book collection,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>50-3
</p>
<p>(4) verification (revision) of the punched cards,
</p>
<p>(5) interpretation of the information punched into the cards,
</p>
<p>(6) filing the cards in the desired sequence,
</p>
<p>(7) preparation of mimeograph stencils, multilith masters,
copy for photo- offset reproduction, carbon copies of the
</p>
<p>catalog, or a single copy of the catalog,
</p>
<p>(8) duplication of the catalog by stencil or offset methods,
unless single or carbon copies were produced in step 7.
</p>
<p>These steps will be described in detail below.
</p>
<p>1 . Determination and Acceptance of Machine Limitations
</p>
<p>It is important to realize that punched card machines cannot at
present economically produce a catalog with all the details to which
the users of card catalogs are accustomed. The IBM card is
limited to eighty characters and the Remington Rand card to ninety.
While more than one card can be used per title, this adds greatly to
the cost of the catalog, in the same way that extension cards add to
the cost of a conventional card catalog. The biggest difference be-
tween conventional cards and punched cards is that the punched card
will accommodate such a much smaller quantity of words. If the
average word is five letters long, an IBM card containing only 13
words plus the 12 spaces required to separate them has already used
up 77 of the maximum of eighty characters it may contain. Yet it is
possible to confine most titles to a single IBM card and still come out
with a successful catalog, as the King County Public and New York
State libraries have demonstrated.
</p>
<p>Although only eighty characters are available in IBM installations,
they may be printed in any of 120 spaces spread across the width of
the page. However, the remaining forty spaces must appear as blank
or identically printed vertical columns, or else must contain duplicate
information. Nothing except duplicate information can be printed in
</p>
<p>any of the forty blank columns unless the same character is printed
all the way down the page in any one column.
</p>
<p>An important exception to this is that if both numerals and letters
are sometimes punched into a certain column of the IBM cards (some
of the cards containing letters in that column and other cards containing
numerals in that column) the numerals and letters may be printed in
different columns on the page by the machine, either the numerals or
the letters going into one of the "extra" forty columns. Thus, on the
</p>
<p>pages of the catalog, one might allot 64 spaces to the descriptive catalog*
ing, followed by ten blank spaces, and 16 spaces for the call number,
with a period printed after the third numeral of the Decimal Classifica-
tion number, and another space to separate the book number from the
class number. Thus, the printing would extend over a width of 92
spaces, leaving 28 spaces at either margin.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>50-4
</p>
<p>Few catalogs would use all forty blank columns. Most libraries
would find it useful to use three or four of these , reducing the width
of the page by not using the remainder. Part of a sample page from
the New York State Library catalog is shown as Fig. 50-1 . By count-
ing the characters across either one of the columns, one can see that
</p>
<p>eighty characters and two blank columns have been used, since no
line exceeds an 82 -character width, and every line contains the same
two blank columns .
</p>
<p>Besides space limitations, another severe limitation is that of the
available variety of characters. No machine with both lower-case and
capital letters is yet available. Consequently, all existing machines
provide capitals only, plus ten numerals. Besides letters and numbers ,
a variety of special symbols and punctuation marks are available. How-
ever, college and university libraries dependent on existing campus
business machine installations will find a hyphen or an asterisk (or
sometimes both) about all that is already available on locally owned
installations. The New York State Library uses asterisks, hyphens,
apostrophes and periods. King County uses an asterisk and an
ampersand. The University of Wisconsin Library School confines
itself to an asterisk. The period printed after the third digit of the
call number on Wisconsin cards is not punched into the cards, but is
printed on every line of the catalog by the tabulating machine.
</p>
<p>Another limitation lies in the fact that only one line is normally
available for the information on each punched card. Thus, the author
and title will be on the same line. In fact, everything will be on the
same line, unless extension cards are used. It is possible, using
special equipment, to cause a certain section of the punched card
information to be printed on a second (or third, etc.) line. This is
not desirable because (1) it confines certain items (fields) of in-
formation to a limited number of spaces, thus reducing flexibility,
and (2) it makes a bulkier catalog, automatically doubling its size
if two lines are used, tripling it if three are used, etc.
</p>
<p>v
</p>
<p>These are the three limitations of any punched card catalog.
If the librarian can accept them, he may begin to plan his catalog.
</p>
<p>2 . Coding Patterns
</p>
<p>The first step in planning is to establish a pattern governing the
placement of information on the punched card. How many of the eighty
spaces shall be devoted to the author and title? How much room is
left for other details of descriptive cataloging? How much room will
the call number occupy? What other information (departmental and
special collection symbols, etc.) will be needed?
</p>
<p>The New York State Library provides 66 spaces for author,
title and date of publication. The University of Wisconsin catalog of
periodicals provides 71 spaces for title, imprint and dates of first
and last holdings, leaving only nine spaces for the call number.
These problems must be solved individually by each library. The
question of whether or not the call number should be complete has</p>

<p>been answered "no" by both New York State Library and the Wisconsin
Library School. In the few cases where the call number must be left
incomplete, the New York State Library supplies an asterisk at the
end. Some call numbers are left incomplete because of the excessive
number of spaces that would be required to provide for the few longest
call numbers in the library.
</p>
<p>In the case of very long authors and titles, devices that may be
brought into play include abbreviations, omissions and extension
cards. The procedures governing the use of these devices at the
University of Wisconsin Library School are described in detail in
the laboratory instructions for this chapter. Sample extension cards
are shown as Figs. 50-3 and 50-4.
</p>
<p>The coding pattern for the University of Wisconsin Library
School periodicals catalog is as follows:
</p>
<p>Item Columns
</p>
<p>Unit Cards
Descriptive Cataloging 1-63
</p>
<p>Beginning Date of Subscription^ 64-67

</p>
<p>Beginning Date of Subscription 64-67
Cut-Off Date of Subscription 68-71

</p>
<p>The coding pattern for the New York State Library catalog
appears to be as follows:
</p>
<p>Item Columns
</p>
<p>Author, Title &amp; Edition 1-62
Date of Publication 63-66
Location Symbol 67
Class Number 68-80
Book Number 7 6- 80
</p>
<p>In the New York State Library checklist, if the class number
extends beyond column 75 the book number is crowded to the right,
beginning wherever the class number leaves off. Otherwise, the
book number begins in column 76. On New York State Library extension
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>50 - 9
</p>
<p>cards, the descriptive cataloging is confined to columns 5-62, columns
1-4 being left blank to show indention.
</p>
<p>The coding pattern should be decided upon only after the most
careful consideration and consultation with persons experienced in
punched card work, preferably in library applications. Once the
coding pattern has been settled, key-punching may begin. After
many cards have been punched, it becomes very expensive to change
the coding pattern, since all the cards must be completely repunched
if the coding pattern is to be changed and if inconsistency in columnar
arrangement of the catalog is to be avoided.
</p>
<p>3. Key-Punching Operations
</p>
<p>The key-punch transforms a blank (unpunched) card into the
punched card from which one line of the catalog will later be printed.
A blank card can be used to produce an entirely blank line in the
catalog, if desired at any point. The modern key-punch punches the
letters of the alphabet and other characters as well as numerals. It
is operated like a typewriter, except that cards are fed into and out
of it at the touch of a button. Anyone who can use an ordinary type-
writer can learn to use a key-punch.
</p>
<p>The key-punch operator can work more easily from a coding sheet,
such as the one shown as Fig. 50-5. Coding sheets may be tailored to
the individual job, such as the one shown as Fig. 50-6. This coding
sheet was devised by the writer in 1952 to simplify key-punching of
the list of periodicals received by the Southern Illinois University
Libraries.
</p>
<p>It is possible, of course, for a key-punch operator to type directly
from copy instead of from coding sheets. The more intelligent the key-
punch operator and the better organized his copy, the less need is
there for coding sheets. The need for extensive use of abbreviations
tends to increase the need for coding sheets.
</p>
<p>4. Verification
</p>
<p>In many punched- card installations, "verifiers" are used to in-
sure accurate punching. A verifier is a machine that looks like a
key-punch, except that it does not actually punch. The operator
places into the machine a card that has already been punched, and
proceeds to "type" the information that was supposedly punched into
the card. If the card was correctly punched, nothing happen9, and
all is well. But if an error was (or is) made, a red light flashes
on. The theory behind the use of this machine is that the typist is
not apt to make the same mistake twice.
</p>
<p>The verification step can be dispensed with unless an extremely
high percentage of accuracy is desired the first time. Errors can
also be detected after the cards have been interpreted, even if they
have not been verified.</p>

<p>The verification step is included in the University of Wisconsin
Library School laboratory project for its demonstration value.
</p>
<p>5 . Interpretation
</p>
<p>The "interpretation 11 of punched cards is necessary only if the
key-punch that was used is not a printing punch. A printing punch
not only punches holes in the cards, but also types across the top
of the cards the letters, numbers, etc. , that are represented by
the holes. The "interpreter" is a machine that prints these letters,
etc. , across the top of a card that was punched by a non-printing
key-punch. The wide use of non-printing key punches would seem
to justify explanation of the interpreter here.
</p>
<p>Interpreters use a larger character- size than printing punches,
which is one of several reasons for the popularity of the inter-
preters. As a result of this feature, however, the eighty characters
are printed by the interpreters on two different lines on the IBM
card, in two separate interpreting operations. This does not, of
course, affect the printing into the catalog of the information
punched into the card; the information will still be printed on one
line of the catalog.
</p>
<p>Another reason for the popularity of the interpreter is that it
permits selective reproduction on the face of the IBM card of the
information punched into it. If, for example, one did not want the
call number to show on the face of the IBM card, the interpreter
could be wired so that it would not be printed there.
</p>
<p>In spite of the smaller type, the writer believes that printing
punches are more efficient than verifiers for catalog-producing
installations , and therefore recommends their use . If a printing
punch is not available (their cost is higher), use of an interpreter
is essential so that the cards can be filed and identified. Certain
types of punches used principally for duplicating cards ("gang-
punching"), do not do their own interpreting, and if these are to be
used an interpreter must be acquired anyway.
</p>
<p>6. Filing the Punched Cards
</p>
<p>After cards have been punched, they must be filed. Filing may
be done mechanically, or by hand (from the visible "interpretation11 ).
If the arrangement is to be numerical, the filing may be done more
rapidly by machine. However, if authors and titles are to be filed
alphabetically, and if the quantity is small, it will probably be
simpler to file them by hand. In punched card systems, numerals
are the result of a single punch in any one column, but letters are
the result of two punches in any one column. Thus the letter "R" is
achieved by a punch in the "11" and "9" positions in any column of
the card (every column contains twelve positions:! -9 1 0,11 and 12).
Thus, in order to sort for a letter, it is necessary to run the entire
group of cards through the sorting machine twice. If 62 columns are</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>50 - 14
</p>
<p>used for author and title information, the sorting machine would have
to review the car&lt;ds 124 times, theoretically. Actually, since the
machines cannot distinguish between authors and titles in the same
field, full use of machines for filing library catalogs is out of the
</p>
<p>question anyhow. IBM machines would arrange the following four
books in the order shown:

</p>
<p>These books, which are actual titles in at least one American
library, represent three different authors. The first and last books
are by the same author. If the article "The11 had been punched into
the card for The Master Book of Soup*, this title would have been
even harder to find.
</p>
<p>The problem can be solved by allotting separate "fields 11 to
authors and titles in the coding pattern, but this creates an intolerable
waste of space by forcing the frequent use of extension cards. How-
ever, it is extremely useful to have the sorter sort out a large group
of cards as far as the authors 1 first names.
</p>
<p>7 . Printing the Catalog
</p>
<p>Once the cards have been arranged, they are ready to be used
to print the catalog. In IBM installations, tabulating or Cardatype
machines are able to do this work. These machines "read11 the
punched cards at rates as high as 150 cards per minute, printing,
a line at a time, the informal! on that was punched into the cards.
Electrically- sensitive brushes reach, through the holes in the cards,
contacts that activate the correct type bars or wheels.
</p>
<p>s,
</p>
<p>These machines act as card-operated typewriters to produce
typed pages of information. Continuous forms of paper are avail-
able so that the operator need not feed individual sheets of paper to
the machine. Continuous forms containing up to 18 carbon copies
are obtainable. The machines will also cut stencils or type litho-
graphic plates for offset reproduction. Fig. 50-2 was reproduced
by photo- offset for this book from copy typed by an IBM 407 tabulator,
</p>
<p>E. Subject Cataloging
</p>
<p>The King County Public Library catalogs provide subject list-
ings using 189 special subject headings, coded numerically. These
numerical code numbers act like Cutter numbers (actually, more
like Olin biography numbers with the A omitted; cf. 13th ed. ,
Decimal Classification, p. 1645) to arrange the subject headings in
alphabetical order. Use of these numbers makes it possible to
arrange the cards alphabetically by subject without punching the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>50-15
</p>
<p>subject heading itself into the card. The subject headings themselves
are printed from a special card filed at the beginning of each set of
unit cards bearing the same code number.
</p>
<p>Coding instructions are discussed fully in Miss Alvord's article.
Coding theory is discussed extensively elsewhere in the literature of
the field of documentation.
</p>
<p>F. Costs
</p>
<p>Punched card installations are expensive. The biggest item is
usually that of the machine used for printing. Special attachments
and other characteristics make comparisons difficult, each adding
to the rental cost of equipment. The International Business Machines
Corporation has been required to publish sale prices for its equip-
ment as of January 1957, although the company will continue its
traditional rental policy as well.
</p>
<p>Typical monthly rental figures in June 1956 for IBM equipment
were:
</p>
<p>Model 024 key-punch $35
Model 05B verifier $35
Model 552 interpreter $75
Model 082 sorter $60
Model 407 tabulator $815
</p>
<p>These figures apply to the University of Wisconsin installations,
but do not include a 20% educational discount.
</p>
<p>At these prices, only the largest libraries can afford the luxury
of punched card catalogs. However, many libraries, college, univer-
sity, public, special and school, have access to punched card equip-
ment. The writer has found punched card machine personnel at
both Southern Illinois University and the University of Wisconsin
willing and even eager to cooperate in projects and operations designed
to help those universities secure a maximum return on their rental
investments. At Southern Illinois University, the writer was encour-
aged to apply IBM procedures to control over book orders, book
funds, the location of precataloged and newly cataloged books, sup-
plies cataloging, the entire library budget, exchange mailing lists,
etc. No charge was made for machine or operator time. At the
New York State Library, the state library pays the Bureau of Sta-
tistical Services for operator time but not for machine rental.
</p>
<p>G. Captions
</p>
<p>Captions for punched card catalogs may be prepared by punching
special cards to carry the information desired as captions. The cap-
tions and explanations in Fig. 50-2 were printed from such a card.
The title-page of the University of Wisconsin Library School catalog
is printed from IBM cards into which the information was carefully
punched and centered*</p>

<p>H. Summary
</p>
<p>Punched card catalogs are the catalogs of the future, available
now to librarians who want their advantages. These are (1) multiple
copies, (2) ease of revision, and (3) the relative inexpensiveness
of production and reproduction. The "relative inexpensiveness 11 is
subject to the provision that the machine installation is kept busy on
other operations and is therefore economically justified.

<p>APPENDIX I
</p>
<p>Laboratory Instructions
University of Wisconsin Library School
</p>
<p>Purpose of laboratory: The laboratory in the graduate course is
conducted (1) to reinforce with practical examples and problems the
principles explained in the lectures and readings! (2) to provide the
student with the personal advice and attention of the instructor in solv-
ing cataloging problems and (3) to enable the instructor to observe
the progress of the student.
</p>
<p>Time: The instructor and reviser are in attendance during the
standarcTTaboratory period of ninety minutes. Students are expected
to ask their advice whenever problems or other obstacles are en-
countered during the carrying out of the laboratory instructions.
Attendance in the laboratory is optional, inasmuch as there is no set
requirement. It is expected that the student will satisfy himself that
he knows how to solve the problems covered by each laboratory assign-
ment. One method of learning how to solve these problems is that of
carrying out the assignment itself. If the student prefers to learn by
another method, or feels that he is already sufficiently- well acquainted
with the problem and its solutions, he need not attend the laboratory.
If he does attend, he may still do the work without being obliged to
submit the results for inspection. However, if he wishes to secure an
evaluation of his work, he may submit it in the prescribed form. Work
will be accepted up to 6 p.m. on the day of the laboratory. Each prob-
lem presented in the laboratory assignments will be represented on the
mid-term and final examinations. Students who have received grades
of less than A on the mid-term test and on previous cataloging courses
are cautioned to try to increase their knowledge of cataloging theory by
completing as much of each laboratory assignment as possible.
Laboratory assignments classed as special projects must be completed
in order to receive a satisfactory grade on the course.
</p>
<p>Procedure; The major principles covered by the lecture are each
represented by a group of books. A student who catalogs any book in
any one group thus encounters the principle represented by that group
of books. There are usually five or six different groups, sometimes
more, sometimes less. An instruction sheet is prepared for each
laboratory. On this sheet are explained the kinds of cards to be pre-
pared that day. Parts of the cataloging process that are to be included
or omitted are also indicated. The books are arranged on a book-
truck by group number, and each student should return completed
books to the correct shelf (and correct location on each shelf) in-
dicated by the shelf labels. Students should not take more than one
book at a time, since the number of books available is limited to only
one or two more than is necessary to go around, for the purpose of
simplifying revision of cards. Students should not trade books with
the persons sitting adjacent to them if maximum benefit from the lab
is to be obtained. Cards are to be prepared in accordance with the
</p>
<p>Al - 1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Al - 2
</p>
<p>lab) instruction sheet for the day. Students should feel free to ask
the advice of the instructor or reviser (both of whom are present)
whenever serious problems or any other obstacles are encountered.
</p>
<p>Output; Each student may catalog as many or as few titles as
he wishes in each lab. Naturally, students who are able to catalog
one book from every group will have a more complete practice ex-
perience and will be better equipped professionally to deal with prob-
lems encountered not only on examinations but also in libraries in
reference, acquisitions, cataloging and related work.
</p>
<p>Completion of laboratory; The student's last name should be
written below the hole on EVERY CARD turned in. Students should
clip together all cards for each title (main card on top), and should
file all the cards for each different title alphabetically by main entry
in the assignment box provided on the reviser's desk at the entrance
to the North Study Hall.
</p>
<p>Group and code numbers should be written in the upper right
corner of every card handed in.
</p>
<p>Evaluating ; The reviser corrects cards prepared in the lab,
employing the abbreviations and proofreaders
</p>
<p>1 marks indicated in
appendix 2. The cards are then reviewed and evaluated. The evalua-
tion "S" is given for satisfactory work, but this is not shown on the
cards. The evaluation "U" (Unsatisfactory) is shown on main cards
if the set of cards is unsatisfactory as a whole. The student may, if
he wishes, resubmit within one week a corrected version of cards
graded fIU M , provided that the original unsatisfactory cards are also
resubmitted. However, the unsatisfactory cards should be discussed
with the instructor or reviser before undertaking this work. No re-
cord of any kind (quality or quantity) for laboratory work is kept by
the instructor.
</p>
<p>Make-up work ; Students absent from the laboratory by reason
of illness or other emergency may submit cards for evaluation within
two weeks (or longer, with permission) after their return to school.
</p>
<p>Sample catalogs ; After cards are evaluated and returned by the
instructor they should be retained until the student has completed the
course. Cards should be arranged and filed by code number for
ready reference during laboratory periods. Special guide cards in
the sample catalog should be used for the following types of cards;
</p>
<p>Authority cards Added entry cards
Cross-references Subject cards
</p>
<p>Sample catalogs should be kept always up to date during the course.
</p>
<p>Supplies; Supplies (ink, P- slips, and catalog cards) are furn-
ished by the Library School. All preliminary work should be done on
3x5 slips. When these draft slips have been completed, the work
should be transferred to card* stock. Ruled cards are to be used when
cards are prepared in manuscript; unruled cards when cards are typed.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Al - 3
</p>
<p>Cards may be prepared on the typewriter in Room 209, or in manu-
script.
</p>
<p>Work pace; Each student is assigned a desk which he may have
to share with another student. Students should not leave valuables in
their desks, as the Library School is not responsible for losses.
Students are expected to find alternative workspace (outside of lab
periods) when other persons are seated at their desks.
</p>
<p>Interviews ; Students are encouraged to make appointments to
discuss problems with the instructor, or to come in without appoint-
ments during office hours. However, before discussing catalog cards
that have been evaluated previously by the instructor and reviser, it
is expected that the student will act upon all indications of incomplete-
ness as shown by the reviser by means of the abbreviations listed in
Appendix 2.</p>

<p>APPENDIX 2
</p>
<p>Correction Symbols Used on Catalog Cards
University of Wisconsin Library School
</p>
<p>These abbreviations and symbols represent suggestions made by
the reviser leading toward improvement of catalog cards for the pur-
pose of better interpretation of the book to its potential readers. The
student is expected to look up in the following list, before consulting
the instructor about the suggestions, all abbreviations shown on
evaluated cards.
</p>
<p>Except for factual misrepresentation of the physical character-
istics of books, there can be no such thing as an error on catalog cards ,
Thus no subject heading or call number can be "wrong. 1 * Rather, some
subject headings are better than others -- for certain books. One sub-
ject heading is "good" for a certain book because it will bring the book
to the attention of a reader who is interested in that book; a "poor"
subject heading for that book is one that displays the book to readers
who are not interested in it, and hides the book from readers who are
interested in it.
</p>
<p>Upper case letters indicate a more serious type of error than do
lower-case letters or numerals. Generally speaking, a set of catalog
cards for one book with only one capital letter error might be con-
sidered very good; a set with two such errors might be considered
fairly good; a set with three, fair; and a set with four, poor. On tests
one point is counted off for each capital letter. This letter is useful
for reviewing before tests and for checking your work before you turn
test papers in.

<p>R Tracings
Rd Is it wise to divide tracings between the front and back
</p>
<p>of a card? How will your staff know the front is
not complete? And if you write "over 11 , readers
will try to see the back.
</p>
<p>Rex Since tracings are made primarily for the library
staff 9 would it not be better to put them on the
back than to add extra cards to the public catalog
just to carry the tracings?
</p>
<p>Rn Tracings incorrectly numbered. Is this entry an
author- approach or a subject entry? Your typist
will type tracings numbered incorrectly in the
wrong color or case (upper or lower), ruining
your LC or Wilson card.
</p>
<p>S Subject Headings
S Subject heading poorly chosen.
S? Is this subject heading necessary?
SI 948 See 1948 supplement to the LC List of Subject Headings
</p>
<p>for a better heading or for additional cross-
references.
</p>
<p>Sa Avoid providing a subject approach to author entries
except by means of see also references from
STANDARD subject headings appearing in your
authority file .
</p>
<p>Sc Subject heading too specific (and in the nature of an
</p>
<p>analytical entry). If you have also assigned a
general heading, you might either omit the
specific heading, or, by assigning enough specific
headings, omit the general heading.
</p>
<p>Sf The subject heading you have used is a form heading
not customarily used for this type of book. The
actual subject of this book (if it is not a work of
the imagination) is expressed through the author
or proper-name subject approach. The form
heading may be useful in bringing together - for
your special clientele - all books of this particular
form.
</p>
<p>Sg Subject heading too general.
Si If you will re-examine this book, you will find that it
</p>
<p>contains extensive treatment of the added subjects
indicated.
</p>
<p>Sn This book does not deal with the subject given by you
and readers looking for a book on that subject
would only be annoyed by extra cards for books
of this type.
</p>
<p>So Subject heading omitted.
SP The subject heading you have chosen is prohibited by
</p>
<p>the standard list recommended for today's lab
(which see) , but you did not state why you pre-
ferred your own form to theirs. Did you make a
cross-reference from the standard heading to
your own so that other catalogers using printed
cards would find your heading?</p>

<p>T Titles
T Title entry incorrectly traced.
T? Is thi title entry necessary? Why not? Ask if you
</p>
<p>don't know.
Tc Is conventional title needed? Will this card file next
</p>
<p>to other editions of the same work without it?
Tco Title-page or label title similar enough to conven-
</p>
<p>tional title to justify omission of the former?
Ti Title entry not necessary because of the principle
</p>
<p>of inevitable association (cf. chapter 35).
TM Title entry would be misleading, causing readers
</p>
<p>to think they had found the place where books on
this subject are listed. We suggest a cross-
reference from the distinctive words in the
title, referring to the appropriate subject heading.
</p>
<p>TV Title entry vital.
Tx Title entry lacking- -how would a reader find this
</p>
<p>book if he knew it by title only?
</p>
<p>U Unsatisfactory; do another book in this group and submit both
sets of cards together, unless minimum require-
ment (if any) has been met without counting this
title.

<p>APPENDIX 4
</p>
<p>Sample Examination,
University of Wisconsin Library School
</p>
<p>This sample test contains instructions identical with those given
on actual mid- term tests and final examinations. However, the
sample questions are pitched at the level of the student beginning the
advanced course, whereas the actual examinations will presume a
more advanced understanding. The sample test is approximately the
same length as a one- hour test. Final examinations given for this
course in the spring last two hours, and would, therefore contain
about twice as many questions.
</p>
<p>UW LIBRARY SCHOOL L. S. 21 5 (Final Exam)
Student name; Advanced Cataloging
</p>
<p>For the purpose of this test, assume you are a cataloger in a
library using the Decimal Classification, Sears' List of Subject Head-
ings, LC Rules for Descriptive Cataloging and ALA Cataloging Rules
with the exceptions that are indicated. Answer the following questions.
You will be graded on the number of correct answers. You may use
all of these books during the test. In addition, you may use the text-
book for the course and any manuscript materials you wish to bring.
</p>
<p>Because of the pressure of time, it is suggested you put a check-
mark by the questions you are in doubt about, and come back to them
later.
</p>
<p>Papers will be taken up promptly at the end of the examination
period.
</p>
<p>Write your name on every page. The pages will be separated in
the grading process.
</p>
<p>I. MAIN, SUBJECT AND ADDED ENTRIES (UNIT CARDS)
</p>
<p>Circle ONE letter on EVERY numbered line, in accordance with
your understanding of readers' approaches to the card catalog, and the
ALA rules. Circle the letter "M" opposite the main entry you would
make, if it is indicated. Circle the letter "S" opposite any subject
entries (if any) you would make. Circle the letter "A" opposite any
added entries (if any) you would make. Circle the letter "N" if you
would not put a unit card under the heading. If you would merely
place a cross- reference card under a certain heading, circle the
letter "N 11 . Assume that your library follows the ALA rules closely
in this section. Subjects may not be divided geographically except as
permitted by Sears or unless specifically stated in the question.
Your library policy on title added entries takes into consideration
the relationship between title, subject and author entries. Consultation
of Sears is essential to answering some of these questions correctly.

</p>
<p>IV. AUTHORITY CARDS AND CROSS-REFERENCES
</p>
<p>Indicate your knowledge of authority cards and cross-references
by circling the appropriate letters of the alphabet. Indicate in ques-
tions and 5 the headings for which you would make authority cards
at the time you were cataloging the book. Below each heading, in-
dicate after the x's any "see" references you might make to that
heading. Indicate after the xx's any "see also 11 references (specific
or general) you might make to that heading. Consider all headings
completely new to your library. Circle ONE letter for EVERY
numbered line.
</p>
<p>If you would make only one authority card, circle B in question 5.
If you would make only one see reference, give it on the first x line.
If you would make only one see also reference, give it on the first xx
line. If you would not make any of the authority cards or cross-
references listed, circle the letter B in the appropriate questions.
If you would make two authority cards, or two see references, or two
see also references, the order in which you list them does not matter.
</p>
<p>Follow Sears 1 practice when appropriate, except for headings of
the type deliberately omitted from the Sears list. You should consult
Sears on EVERY question, however.

<p>V. FILING
</p>
<p>In the following groups of questions, three entries, represent-
ing three cards correctly filed in the card catalog, are shown at
the beginning of each question. These three cards are identified by
the letters B, D and F. The spaces ahead, between and behind
these three cards are designated A, C, E and G.
</p>
<p>Insert, one by one, the numbered entries into spaces A, C, E
or G in what you consider the proper alphabetical sequence. Do this
by circling the correct letter opposite each entry. In each question
consider that only four cards are involved -- the three already in
the catalog (B, D fc F) and the one in the question you are working on.</p>

<p>(2) Decide what other forms of name (if any) readers might look
under for books by this same author. Prepare cards guiding readers
to the form of name you chose. What are these cards called? Make
a record of them. Where is this record kept?

<p>LABORATORY ASSIGNMENT C
Decimal Classification Review
</p>
<p>Parti
</p>
<p>Each one of the books chosen for this laboratory represents a
different classification problem . Classify, according to the Decimal
Classification, 15th edition, as many as you have time for during the
laboratory period. Classify fiction. Do not submit the lab sheet at
all; a key will be posted on the bulletin board.
</p>
<p>All types of classification problems are represented, including
nuanber- building using geographic, literary form and standard sub-
divisions. Books representing certain special features of the Decimal
classification are included also. You will be held responsible on the
examinations for using the 15th edition effectively in classifying such
books. It is recommended, therefore, that you attempt to classify all
the books listed before the mid-term . This laboratory assignment is
an excellent reviewing medium, and extra copies may be obtained
from the instructor for this purpose.

<p>Part 2
</p>
<p>Special Project
</p>
<p>Each student has been assigned to work with a specific part of the
shelflist of the library school's Practice Collection. The work should
proceed as follows:
</p>
<p>1. Unclassified titles. Unclassified titles (including fiction) should
be classified. In assigning new call numbers, use LC-type book
numbers when possible.
</p>
<p>2. Review of classification. All call numbers should be reviewed in
the light of changes made in the 15th edition of the Decimal Clas-
sification., Those that need changes will probably fall into one of
the following categories:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Lab C-3
</p>
<p>(a) overexpanded number s,
(b) underexpanded numbers,
(c) out-of-date numbers (number assigned a different meaning
</p>
<p>in* the 15th edition), or
(d) badly chosen numbers.
</p>
<p>3. Clip a 1" x l lf slip of paper to the upper right corner of each card
you plan to classify or reclassify. Write the proposed call number
on this slip. Initial the back of each shelf!1st card under the hole.
File the card behind your name guide at the close of the laboratory
period a week from today.
</p>
<p>4. These cards will be returned to you two weeks from today, with
comments and corrections concerning the class numbers you
have chosen.
</p>
<p>5. Your next step is to type the new call numbers on all catalog
cards - shelflist card, main card, added entries and subject
entries. Place a red filing flag in front of each card you have
filed, dropping all cards below the rod. All cards must be re-
filed by three weeks from today in order to receive a satisfactory
grade on this problem.</p>

Forms of Subject Headings
</p>
<p>Catalog folly no more than one title in each group. Use Library of
Congress subject headings. Classify the books for the Practice Col-
lection (i.e. consult the shelflist before assigning call numbers). Try
to find a heading of the type suggested.
</p>
<p>Make main cards, subject authority cards, and also name authority
cards if cross-references are desirable (consult CBI for all proper-
name headings). DO NOT MAKE (1) added entries, (2) subject entries f
or (3) actual cross-references. However, DO trace all added entries,
subject entries and cross-references that are desirable. Do not consult
the card catalog or the Practice Collection subject authority-file.

<p>LABORATORY ASSIGNMENT I
Subject Cross-References; Special Project
</p>
<p>Today's laboratory project is designed to give you experience in
the construction and administration of a subject authority file. You
are to make twelve authority cards for subject headings used in the
card catalog of the Practice Collection. You are also to prepare and
file the necessary cross-references.
</p>
<p>Procedure
</p>
<p>A black-tipped guide-card will be given each student. On it are
the names of two subject headings. You are to work with the part of
the card catalog between, and including, these two headings.
</p>
<p>Step 1 (due 1 week from today)
</p>
<p>Remove from the subject authority file all existing cards between
and including the two headings assigned to you. Prepare new (typed)
authority cards for the first TWELVE subject headings appearing in
your part of the catalog and not now listed in the subject authority
file. Regard each different heading (different subdivisions, etc.) as a
new heading. Do not make authority cards for author entries (personal
or corporate) even if they are used as subject headings.
</p>
<p>Make all the cross-references listed in the LC list and any addi-
tional ones that you think may be needed. Base your judgment on subject
heading theory and on your knowledge of the principles underlying the
construction of headings deliberately omitted from the standard lists.
</p>
<p>Make the cross-references on P-slips, in ink. Clip the cross-
references behind each authority card. Write your name on all card?
and slips.
</p>
<p>When a heading with subdivision is not used in our catalog without
subdivision, make two authority cards, one with and one without
subject subdivision, If the subject heading is found in LC only without
subdivision, indicate the source only on the authority card for the un-
subdivided heading.
</p>
<p>If you find the heading on a recent LC card, but not in the LC list
you may cite LC as authority. However, check the heading in the sup-
plements to the LC list for necessary cross-references.
</p>
<p>If you do not find the heading in LC, and it is not a type properly
omitted fr*m LC (e.g. proper-name subjects) remove all the cards for
that heading, choose a new heading, make the necessary authority card
and cross references (as explained above) and clip them to the removed
</p>
<p>catalog cards, with the authority card on top. Consult the instructor
or reviser about these.
</p>
<p>Lab 1-1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Lab 1-2
</p>
<p>Copy LC capitalization and punctuation EXACTLY unless it differs
from theory or practice taught in this course. File the authority card
you have made into the subject authority file. The cross-references
should be clipped behind the authority cards. Write your last name
under the hole on the front of each card and on the front of each P-slip.
You have exactly ONE WEEK to prepare step 1 of the assignment.
</p>
<p>Step 2
</p>
<p>Errors and misunderstandings will be indicated on cards returned
to you. Please correct these within two days after they are returned to
</p>
<p>you, leaving the corrected cards in the instructor's office.
</p>
<p>Step 3
</p>
<p>Your cross-references on P- slips will be returned to you in time
for Laboratory O. At that time you will type up and file the cross-
references in accordance with the instructions furnished for that
</p>
<p>laboratory.</p>

<p>LABORATORY ASSIGNMENT
Serials
</p>
<p>Catalog a title from each group if you have time. The latest vol-
ume of each periodical is on the truck; others are in their places in
the stacks.
</p>
<p>Group 1 (15D) Dead Periodicals
</p>
<p>These are "dead 11 periodicals, i.e. they have ceased publication.
Catalog them in accordance with the instructions in Chapter 31 and
according to LC rule 7. Make main cards, and trace all added entries.
Make name authority cards for all corporate entries (main or dead)
but not subject authority cards. Make shelflist cards with accession
numbers for bound volumes.
</p>
<p>Classify them and subject-head them according to Dewey and LC.
Use LC-type book numbers.

to both the old and the new title. Make main cards only. Make name
authority cards for all corporate entries (main or added) but not subject
authority cards. Trace all added and subject entries. Make shelflist
cards, but do not use accession numbers (many libraries have abandoned
the use of accession numbers in recent years). Use Mann periodical

Periodicals in a Special Library; Special Project
</p>
<p>You are asked to catalog completely, for the Library School Library,
the periodical assigned to you.
</p>
<p>Classify this periodical to fit into the Library School's research
collection shelflist. Prepare a main card and a shelflist card and any
necessary name and subject authority cards, in manuscript, due a week
from today. These will be returned to you a week later for correction
and typing.
</p>
<p>For missing issues of the past ten years, fill out a double claim
postcard addressed to the publisher. List the title and missing issues
on the return portion of this card. Add the note: "These issues are
missing from our files and we will be grateful if you can send them
without charge.
</p>
<p>" Submit this postcard with your manuscript unit card.
In typing, produce all the necessary cards, i.e. main and shelflist
</p>
<p>cards, added and subject entries, name and subject authority cards,
and cross-references, to the extent needed. On shelflist cards, list
bound volumes in ink, unbound volumes in pencil. These are due three
weeks from today.
</p>
<p>This is the only cataloging lesson in either of the two cataloging
courses offered in the Library School in which you have an opportunity
to carry a single title all the way through the entire cataloging process
without using LC cards.

<p>PLEASE arrange and distribute the slips you made before going
for your coffee break.
</p>
<p>The persons to whom you distributed your references should then
arrange alphabetically the references they have collected. Then the
references should be checked with the card catalog to see if they can
be combined with cross-reference cards already there (see Figs. 1-
3). If so, the cross-reference cards already there should be removed
and the new headings added. If not. the cross-references should be
typed fresh. All cross-references should be refiled behind red filing
flags.
</p>
<p>"See also" references should be filed at the beginning of the file
of cards under the headings referred from. However, in searching
for cross-references that need to be combined, look at the end of the
file of cards as well as the beginning, since they have been filed both
</p>
<p>ways in the past.

<p>The Classified Catalog
</p>
<p>Using the shelflist cards assigned to you as main cards, type
numerical subject cards for a classified catalog of our practice col-
lection. Trace the numerical subject headings on the backs of the
shelflist cards. This assignment is due two weeks from today.
</p>
<p>1. Numerical subject cards. Prepare these as unit cards Type
the numerical subject headings in the same place where alpha-
betical subject headings ordinarily go. Use the Decimal (15th
ed.) classification You may refer to existing catalog cards,
the books themselves and to any other sources useful in assign-
ing subject headings. While sometimes you will assign one
numerical heading for each alphabetical one previously used, at
other times fewer or more numerical headings will be required
At least one subject card should be prepared for every book
</p>
<p>2. Index cards Subject index cards, referring to each numerical
</p>
<p>heading used, are to be typed.
</p>
<p>3. Subject authority cards- A subject authoritv card should be typed
for each numerical heading traced Cross-references should be
traced on this authority card
</p>
<p>4 Call numbers . Use existing call numbers. Consult the books
before assigning numerical subject headings,
</p>
<p>5 There should be an authoritv card for each component part of
each class number assigned Thus for a Decimal classification
number including six digits, there should be six authority cards.
Leave a dummy authority card in the numerical authority file for
each authority card you make . Sign vour name on the front of
the dummy authority card</p>

entry. Do not make authority cards for persons not composers, or for
entries already established in the authority file. Indicate such estab-
lished headings by using appropriate symbols in the tracings on main
cards.
</p>
<p>Classify the records according to the instructions.
</p>
<p>Prefer the special LC list of music subject headings to the larger,
general LC list. The smaller one has a wider choice of headings and
is easier to use.
</p>
<p>When the lab is over, clip together all main entries for each record
and file the packs of cards alphabetically by manufacturer and numer-
ically thereafter.
</p>
<p>Refile the records numerically within each group.

<p>LABORATORY ASSIGNMENT 50
Punched Card Catalogs
</p>
<p>Special Project
</p>
<p>A. Purpose and Nature of the Project
</p>
<p>The purpose of this laboratory assignment is to acquaint the student
with the methods of preparing library catalogs using punched cards and
the appropriate mechanical equipment.
</p>
<p>The demonstration project involves work toward completion of a
catalog of the most important periodicals received by the library
school. The catalog will be issued in two parts:
</p>
<p>(1) an alphabetical arrangement by main entry, and
</p>
<p>(2) a numerical arrangement by Decimal Classification
number.
</p>
<p>The alphabetical section is a main entry catalog. No added entries
of any kind are included. However, cross-references from earlier
(changed) titles are included. Choice of main entry will be governed
by the principles laid down in this textbook. A sample page from the first
edition of the catalog appears as Fig. 50-2.
</p>
<p>Each student will be responsible for three periodical titles or none
at all, at his option. If the student elects to participate in this project,
he is expected to complete it.
</p>
<p>B. Procedure
</p>
<p>The responsibility of the participating student includes:
</p>
<p>(1) acceptance of three P- slips naming the titles to be
worked on,
</p>
<p>(2) determining, or verifying, the call numbers of the
periodicals,
</p>
<p>(3) determining, or verifying, the holdings of the library
school library,
</p>
<p>(4) preparing key-punch instructions for the three titles on
one key-punch instruction form (coding sheet),
</p>
<p>(5) correction of the revised coding sheet, if corrections
are needed,
</p>
<p>(6) key-punching IBM cards for the three titles,
</p>
<p>(7) verification of the punched cards,
</p>
<p>Lab 50 - 1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Lab 50 - 2
</p>
<p>(8) interpretation of the punched cards,
</p>
<p>(9) filing the punched and verified cards, manually, in
</p>
<p>alphabetical sequence in the library school at the
shelflist desk,
</p>
<p>(10) observation, in the Payroll Office, of the printing of
the alphabetical catalog, using the IBM 407 tabulator,
</p>
<p>(11) observation of the use of the IBM sorter to rearrange
the cards by class number,
</p>
<p>(12) observation of the use of the IBM 407 tabulator to print
the numerically classed section of the catalog,
</p>
<p>(13) acceptance of a copy of the complete catalog.
</p>
<p>Step 11 must be compared on an efficiency basis with manual sorting
of a hundred cards. The cards will have to be run through the sorting
machine eleven times for it to arrange them numerically. The ma-
chine can actually do the sorting of such a small number of cards
more rapidly than a person could, even though it sorts them eleven
times. The amount of make- ready time and machine -scheduling
problems would probably nullify the time saved in such a small
operation. This step is included for its demonstration value.
</p>
<p>C. Holdings
</p>
<p>The student will find it necessary to verify the holdings of the
three titles assigned to him. He should consult the actual volumes
for this purpose. Only the earliest and latest volumes will be
shown* An asterisk will be printed in column 63 if any of the volumes
between the earliest and latest listed are missing. Volumes will be
shown by date (year) only. Non- calendar years will be expressed by
printing the later of the two years, and an asterisk in place of the
"I 11 in column 68, e.g.
</p>
<p>1904 *942
</p>
<p>This would signify that the library holds 1903/04 through 1941/42.
</p>
<p>When the statement of holdings (if any) supplied the student on
the P-slip differs from that found in the stacks, the student should
consult the shelflist in zoom 203. If the statement there does not
agree with the situation in the stacks, the student should prepare
the coding sheet on the basis of whichever record shows the greater
holdings, giving an explanation on the P-slip, however. P-slips
should be clipped to the coding sheets when the latter are handed
in. Students 1 names should be written on P-slips and coding sheets.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Lab 50 - 3
</p>
<p>The earliest date (year) IB to be written in columns 64-67 and the
latest date into columns 68-71 . If the subscription is current, or if
the school owns any issues of 1954 or later, columns 68-71 should
be left blank, unless the periodical has definitely ceased publication.
In the printed catalog, a blank space will appear between columns 63
and 64, 67 and 68, 71 and 72.
</p>
<p>In the case of irregularly -published serials, beginning and
terminal volume numbers may be given in place of years.
</p>
<p>D. Call Numbers
</p>
<p>Columns 72-80 are reserved for call numbers. Columns 72-78
are used for class numbers, and columns 79 and 80 for the first two
digits of the book number. No effort will be made to show the entire
book number, owing to lack of space in the catalog. If the class
number should require more than seven spaces, columns 79 and 80
should be used to complete it. If this is not enough space, it should
be carried only through column 79 and an asterisk printed in column
80 to show that it is incomplete.
</p>
<p>The decimal point will be printed between columns 74 ard 75 by
the tabulating machine, and should not be punched into the cards.
</p>
<p>If the set is kept in the reference collection, that fact may be
shown by punching an R in column 78. If the call number occupies
that column, the R designation will be broadened to KEF and in-
cluded after the title. The tabulating machine will be wired to print
the R in a blank column just ahead of the call number. However,
numerals punched into column 78 will be printed in that column.
</p>
<p>E. Titles
</p>
<p>Space is provided in columns 1-63 for titles or main entriee , if
main entry is not under title. If necessary., the abbreviations gi^en
in Section H below are to be used m order to avoid using an extension
card. However, no abbrev:at:on may be used for the first word of
any title, except entries begTnning with the abbreviation "U.S.
</p>
<p>11 One
punched space follows abbreviations.
</p>
<p>Two punched spaces separate basically different parts of an
entry, e.g. issuing agency from title, issuing agency from subdivi-
sion, title from subtitle (subtitles will normally be omitted), title
from place of publication, etc. Words normally hyphenated will be
written together or separated by a space, depending on which is the
more appropriate procedure. Apostrophes are to be omitted, and
the space closed up.
</p>
<p>Names of publishers (except trade publishers) are to be included.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Lab 50 - 4
</p>
<p>F. Key- Punching Procedure and Schedule
</p>
<p>A sample coding sheet, showing punching instructions for main
entries, cross-references and extension cards, appears as Fig.
50-5.
</p>
<p>After the coding sheet has been revised, corrected and approved,
the student is ready to undertake the actual key-punching. This will
be done in room B-10, Bascom Hall, according to the schedule posted
on the L.S Z15 bulletin board. Key-punching instruction will be given
by three student supervisors appointed from the class. After the
IBM cards have been punched, verified, and interpreted, they should
be filed alphabetically by title in the box on top of the shelflist desk
in the Library School building.
</p>
<p>Students are cautioned not to forget to press the shift key when
punching numerals.
</p>
<p>G. Changes of Title; Cross-References
</p>
<p>Complete holdings are shown under the latest title. Cross-
references are made from earlier titles. In some cases, other
cross-references will be necessary.
</p>
<p>All cross-references should be traced on the P-slip for the
</p>
<p>periodical. After the IBM card for the periodical has been punched,
the tracing should be transferred in ink to the front of the IBM card,
as shown in Fig. 50-7.
</p>
<p>After the cross-reference has been traced on the main IBM
card, the IBM cross-reference card itself should be punched.
Punching instructions should be written in advance on the student's
coding sheet, . Cross-references should not con-
tain any punching in columns 64-80. If more space is needed, an
extension card should be used.
</p>
<p>H. Abbreviations
</p>
<p>Abbreviations should be used only for the purpose of avoiding
an extension card, except in the case of "U.S. 11 entries.
</p>
<p>The following abbreviations may be used without special permis-
sion. Permission to use additional abbreviations may be obtained by
giving the desired abbreviation on the coding shet
</p>
<p>This list is reprinted, with slight modifications, from the
New York State Library's Checklist of Books and Pamphlets in the
Social Sciences .</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Lab 50-5
</p>
<p>with a red circle around it. If the form is marked MNot Permitted 11
by the reviser, it will be necessary to transfer the proposed card
to a new line on the form, resubmitting the coding sheet
</p>
<p>. immediately for approval. If necessary, the letter "S" may
be added to any abbreviation to make it plural.
</p>

tions .

<p>I . Extension Cards
</p>
<p>Extension cards are to be avoided, is possible. When necessary,
they are to be prepared like main cards , with the following exceptions:
</p>
<p>1 . Punching instructions for extension cards must be listed
on coding sheets on the line immediately below the card
being extended.
</p>
<p>2 . Columns 1*2 may not be used.
</p>
<p>3. Holdings are to be omitted from the main card, and shown
in columns 64 - 71 of the extension card. If more than one
extension card is needed for a single title, the holdings are
to be given on the last extension card.
</p>
<p>4. The words "EXTENDED BY 11 are to be written in ink in
very large capitals under the "interpretation11 on the first
card (the extended card), aa shown in Fig. 50-3. The
wording of the extension card must be given in ink below
these words. This should be followed by the words "See
next card." This will permit locating the extension card
if it should become filed under its own "interpretation."</p>

<p>Lab 50 - 11
</p>
<p>5. The wording of the extended card 10 to be written in ink on
the extension card, directly beneath its own "interpreta-
tion" (its own title), as shown in Fig. 50-4. The words
11Card 2 of" should be written above this wording.
</p>
<p>6. Extension cards must be filed behind the card they are
designed to extend. If they should become separated, the
manuscript wording on each will permit them to be refiled
correctly.
</p>
<p>7 . Call numbers are to be duplicated on all extended and exten-
sion cards. A call number suppressor punch (X) is to be
punched into column 78 on all extended cards, but not on the
last extension card, for any one title. It is necessary to
include call numbers on the extended cards in order to sort
them mechanically for the numerically classed section of
the catalog. The "call-number suppressor 11 punch will,
however, prevent the call number from being printed on
each line except the last line for any one title .</p>
