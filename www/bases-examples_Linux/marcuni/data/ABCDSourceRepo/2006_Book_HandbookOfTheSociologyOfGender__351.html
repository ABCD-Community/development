<p>Preface 
</p>
<p>During the past three decades, feminist scholars have successfully demonstrated the ubiq-
uity and omnirelevance of gender as a sociocultural construction in virtually all human 
collectivities, past and present. Intrapsychic, interactional, and collective social processes 
are gendered, as are micro, meso, and macro social structures. Gender shapes, and is 
shaped, in all arenas of social life, from the most mundane practices of everyday life to 
those of the most powerful corporate actors. Contemporary understandings of gender 
emanate from a large community of primarily feminist scholars that spans the gamut of 
learned disciplines and also includes non-academic activist thinkers. However, while in-
corporating some cross-disciplinary material, this volume focuses specifically on socio-
logical theories and research concerning gender, which are discussed across the full array 
of social processes, structures, and institutions. 
</p>
<p>As editor, I have explicitly tried to shape the contributions to this volume along 
several lines that reflect my long-standing views about sociology in general, and gender 
sociology in particular. First, I asked authors to include cross-national and historical 
material as much as possible. This request reflects my belief that understanding and 
evaluating the here-and-now and working realistically for a better future can only be 
accomplished from a comparative perspective. Too often, American sociology has been 
both tempero- and ethnocentric. Second, I have asked authors to be sensitive to 
within-gender differences along class, racial/ethnic, sexual preference, and age cohort 
lines. This request reflects the growing sensitivity of feminist scholars to the white, middle-
class, and heterosexist biases implicit in much of our past work, which has effectively 
glossed over differences among women (especially) and consigned many categories of 
women to invisibility. Third, I have intentionally omitted a chapter on men and mascu-
linity and asked authors to take seriously the fact that there are two genders that require 
examination and comparison. Too often, works in gender sociology are about women 
only or, less frequently, men only. Just as one cannot understand the experiences, con-
straints, and consciousness of an ethnic or racial minority without understanding its rela-
tionship to the dominant group, one cannot understand those of women apart from their 
relationship to men, culturally defined masculinity and male-dominated institutions. In-
deed, one cannot adequately understand dominant groups without simultaneously exam-
ining their relationships to subordinate groups. Happily, the chapter authors have taken </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>viii Preface 
</p>
<p>my various suggestions seriously, to the extent that available research and space in this 
volume permit. 
</p>
<p>Because gender permeates all aspects of sociocultural life, the breadth of our field is 
enormous. This is reflected in the large number of chapters (27) in this book, including 
discussions of virtually every social institution (the economy, the family, the polity, the 
legal, military and criminal justice systems, health care, education, science, sport, reli-
gion) as well as numerous social structures and processes at both the macro- and micro-
levels. The purpose of this handbook is to cover the breadth of the field of gender sociol-
ogy. The purpose of each chapter is to provide reasonably in-depth discussions of the 
various facets of the field, including an up-to-date bibliography of the major sources. The 
intended audiences comprise professional sociologists and graduate students who seek 
information about the current state of knowledge in gender sociology generally or in one 
or more of its specialized subdivisions, as well as feminist scholars in other disciplines 
who seek to incorporate into their work the knowledge developed by their sociological 
counterparts. 
</p>
<p>The book is divided into four sections. Part I, Basic Issues, consists of three chapters 
that address gender theory, feminist epistemology, and the sociology of gender differ-
ences and similarities. The seven chapters in Part II focus on macrolevel structures and 
processes, and deal with the topics of societal evolution, national development, migra-
tion, poverty, social movements, organizations, and culture as they relate to gender. Con-
sisting of four chapters. Part III is devoted to microlevel structures and processes, includ-
ing discussions of socialization, social roles, interaction, and violence and harassment, as 
they shape and are shaped by gender. The last section of the book. Part IV, concerns the 
relationship between gender and the social institutions listed above, and totals 13 chap-
ters. The authors of each chapter were carefully selected for their expertise in the relevant 
topic, and collectively they constitute some of the best talent in gender sociology today. I 
am very proud to have my name as editor associated with those of these authors. 
</p>
<p>When I was first invited to edit this volume, I was reluctant to accept because I had 
never edited a book, but had heard often what a time-consuming and frustrating job it 
could be. To get a feel for what it might entail, I developed a draft table of contents and 
sent it to about a dozen gender sociologists whose work I respect and who are personal 
friends and acquaintances. I also asked each to volunteer to write a chapter and to suggest 
other possible chapter authors. I received excellent suggestions for additions and alter-
ations to the table of contents, as well as for potential authors. Equally important, nearly 
everyone I initially contacted was enthusiastic about the importance of the project. Given 
these responses, I accepted the editorship. 
</p>
<p>What followed was even more exciting, for as I began to call people to ask if they 
would write specific chapters, their responses were overwhelmingly positive and enthusi-
astic. The result was that I was able to line up outstanding authors for each chapter within 
about a two week period. As is the case with most edited books, many chapters came in 
later than anticipated, and a few never materialized at all. The reasons for many of the 
delays and absences reflect the status of the authors, most of whom had a variety of other 
professional commitments and some of whom accepted new jobs and moved during the 
process of writing their chapters. Also reflected were the realities of life for professional 
women: an adopted baby and a couple of births; care for aged and infirm parents; and, 
unfortunately, a few cases of ill health and a house that burned down, taking with it a 
draft of the chapter manuscript. Nevertheless, in the end, because of the quality and </p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>dedication of the authors, the job of editing this book proved to be a most gratifying 
experience. 
</p>
<p>In addition to thanking all the contributors to this volume, who have worked hard to 
produce excellent chapters, I would like to thank Howard Kaplan of Texas A &amp; M Uni-
versity, the editor of the Plenum series of sociology handbooks, who invited me to edit 
this one. Eliot Werner, my Plenum editor, has been a pleasure to work with and has 
expedited every step of the process with efficiency and good cheer. Finally, thanks to all 
those who provided me potential author names and suggestions for revising my original 
table of contents: Elizabeth Almquist (now Esterchild), Margaret Andersen, Dana Dunn, 
Paula England, Joan Huber, Helena Lopata, Judith Lorber, Barbara Reskin, Beth Schneider, 
and Ruth Wallace.

<p>The Varieties of Gender Theory 
</p>
<p>in Sociology 
</p>
<p>JANET SALTZMAN CHAFETZ 
</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>As editor, I have chosen to begin this handbook where I believe all sociology should 
begin: with a review of the array of theoretical ideas available to, in this case, gender 
sociologists as they explore the social world, in the United States and elsewhere, looking 
at both the present and earlier times. Because they constitute the conceptual toolkit that 
helps gender sociologists make sense of the empirical world, many of the theories dis-
cussed in this chapter are developed further in later, substantive ones. In this chapter, I 
review the major gender/feminist theories in sociology, beginning with a review of what 
classical, nineteenth and early twentieth century theorists said about gender, but focusing 
most attention on theories developed since 1970, when the impact of second wave femi-
nist activism began to be felt in our discipline. I generally confine my discussion to theo-
ries developed by sociologists, although the full corpus of feminist theory is far broader in 
its origins, both activist and academic. Omitted from this chapter are discussions of rela-
tively narrow, substantive theories, which appear in subject-appropriate chapters. Also 
omitted is Standpoint Theory, the topic of an entire chapter (2), an approach sometimes 
considered virtually synonymous with the term "feminist theory." The current chapter 
demonstrates the many other types of contemporary feminist theory that emanate from, 
reflect, and significantly revise the rich variety of theoretical traditions in sociology (see 
Chafetz, 1988, 1997; England, 1993; Wallace, 1989, on the varieties of contemporary 
feminist sociological theory).

<p>All theory pertaining to gender is not feminist, although all feminist theory centers 
much or all of its attention on gender. Three features make a gender theory specifically 
feminist: (1) a (not necessarily exclusive) focus on the inequities, strains, and contradic-
tions inherent in gender arrangements; (2) an assumption that gender relations are not 
immutable but rather changeable social creations; and (3) a normative commitment that 
societies should develop equitable gender arrangements (Alway, 1995, p. 211; Chafetz, 
1988, p. 5 ). 
</p>
<p>2. THE CLASSICAL TRADITION 
</p>
<p>The nineteenth and early twentieth century founding fathers of sociology lived amidst the 
international protest of first wave women's movements, an intellectual, political, and 
social ferment that compelled most to address the "woman question" in some manner 
(Kandal, 1988). Regardless of their views concerning feminism, most confined their dis-
cussion of women largely to issues of family, emotion, and sexuality, embedded within 
broader theories that typically stressed the importance of other, male-dominated struc-
tures (e.g., social class and the economy; political, legal, and military systems; bureau-
cracy; religion). Moreover, women and femininity constituted the problem or issue. The 
effects of culturally defined masculinity on shaping the structures and processes central 
to their theories were largely unrecognized, males were infrequently examined in terms 
of gender, and male-dominated social structures/institutions were implicitly defined as if 
they were gender neutral. With few exceptions, the best that can be said for our classical 
tradition is that gender issues were peripheral; at worst, some theorists promulgated a 
crude biological determinism to justify gender inequities. The contemporary version of 
the sociological theory canon, as exemplified in all but a handful of theory texts, contin-
ues this androcentric bias, largely ignoring or short-shrifting both the topic of gender and 
the contributions of contemporary feminist theories, which remain substantially ghettoized 
(Alway, 1995; Stacey &amp; Thorne, 1985; Ward &amp; Grant, 1991). Moreover, many contempo-
rary "general" theorists, such as James Coleman, Jeffrey Alexander, Peter Berger, and 
Anthony Giddens, ignore the topic of gender entirely (Seidman, 1994, p. 304). 
</p>
<p>2.1. The Biological Approach: Apologists for the Status Quo 
</p>
<p>Several early founders of sociology assumed that men and women are innately different 
</p>
<p>and unequal in their intellectual, emotional, and moral capacities. Herbert Spencer, the 
</p>
<p>founder of British sociological theory, began as a liberal feminist, as reflected in his book 
</p>
<p>Social Statics, in which he devoted a chapter to "The Rights of Women." He argued that 
</p>
<p>men and women deserve equal rights, inasmuch as there are only "trifling mental varia-
</p>
<p>tions" between them (Kandal, 1988, p. 32). Within 4 years he had embarked on Social 
</p>
<p>Darwinism and decided that biology (not culture) produced profound (no longer trivial) 
</p>
<p>sex differences. Women, whose brains are smaller, are deficient in the sense of justice and 
</p>
<p>reasoning ability required of all life beyond the care of husband and children. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>women naturally prefer to be protected by a powerful man. Permitting women to enter 
</p>
<p>public life would therefore be antithetical to human progress (Kandal, 1988, pp. 32-46). 
</p>
<p>The founder of French sociology, Auguste Comte, echoed these sentiments. Because of 
</p>
<p>their emotional and spiritual "superiority," women are perfectly fit for family and domes-</p>
<p/>

<p>The Varieties of Gender Theory in Sociology 5 
</p>
<p>tic life, but their state of "perpetual infancy" and intellectual inferiority to men render 
them unfit for anything else (Kandal, 1988, pp. 46-77). Similar stereotypes about the 
innate natures of women and men, and conclusions about the appropriate roles and status 
of each, were repeated by founders of German (Ferdinand Toennes) and Italian (Vilfredo 
Pareto) sociology (Kandal, 1988, pp. 177-182 and 193-201). 
</p>
<p>The most famous early French sociologist, Emile Durkheim, also resorted to a bio-
logical explanation of what he recognized as women's social subordination (Kandal, 1988, 
pp. 77-88, especially 85; Lehmann, 1990, 1994). In Suicide, his statistics demonstrated 
that marriage produces opposite effects for men, for whom it lowers the suicide rate, and 
women, among whom the rate is higher among the married. He concluded that marriage 
ought some day to be reformed but, in the interim, men must be protected from suicide 
through the maintenance of a form of marriage that produces more stress and disadvan-
tage for women (Kandal, 1988, p. 88). His justification was that the increase in suicide 
for married women is less than that for unmarried men because women have fewer "so-
ciability needs," are more "instinctive," have a less developed "mental life," and there-
fore are more easily satisfied. Men are more "complex," and their psychological balance 
is more precarious and in need of the constraining protections afforded by existing mari-
tal arrangements (Kandal, 1988, pp. 83-85). Feminism supported divorce and, therefore, 
Durkheim opposed it as rooted in "unscientific" thinking (Lehmann, 1990). Durkheim 
also referred to the topic of gender in The Division of Labor in Society, where he argued 
that increasing physical and cultural differentiation have evolved over time between the 
sexes, allowing for increasing specialization of labor between them and, therefore, "con-
jugal solidarity." A state of gender similarity and equality is a "primitive" one associated 
with unstable marital unions (Lehmann, 1990, pp. 164-165; Kandal, 1988, pp. 80-81). 
</p>
<p>2.2. Gender as Inequitable but Peripheral 
</p>
<p>Proponents of classical Marxist theory were well aware that gender arrangements are 
both the product of social life and inequitable. The most fully developed statement of this 
approach, Friedrich Engels' The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, is 
an evolutionary theory describing three stages, each characterized by a different form of 
marriage. Gender inequality originated during the third stage, when an inheritable eco-
nomic surplus first arose due to technological development and the institution of private 
property. Men overthrew the traditional matrilineal system to ensure that their sons would 
inherit, and instituted all manner of controls over women to insure "proper" paternity. 
During this stage household work became private service, and women were excluded 
from social production and became legally subordinated to men (p. 104). The solution to 
gender inequality is the abolition of capitalism, which would eliminate concerns about 
inheritance and paternity and return women to "public industry" (pp. 105-106). Women's 
emancipation was a stated goal of most Marxist parties and thinkers in subsequent de-
cades. However, orthodox Marxism, including its feminist proponents (e.g., Rosa Lux-
emburg and Clara Zetkin), juxtaposed their position to that of "bourgeoisie feminism" by 
claiming that gender inequities were the byproduct of social class inequality and that the 
replacement of capitalism with socialism would automatically resolve women's prob-
lems. 
</p>
<p>Max Weber, under the influence of his activist mother and wife, supported the lib-
eral branch of the women's rights movement (Kandal, 1988, pp. 126-156). In General </p>

</p>
<p>Economic History, he refined Engels' theory in describing the transition from matriar-
chal tribes to patriarchal agrarian societies, a process by which the gender division of 
labor within the family increased and the status of women declined. Reflecting his gen-
eral theoretical orientation, Weber responded to the ghost of Marx by arguing that this 
transition was not simply a function of economic change, but also reflected alterations in 
the military, religion, and magic (Kandal, 1988, pp.146-147 and 149-151). He under-
stood that the process of societal rationalization, a central theme in Weber's work, was a 
masculine phenomenon. Despite his sensitivity to the historically specific subordination 
of women, Weber failed to explore the conditions under which they challenge gender 
inequality and in his premier essay on social inequality, "Class, Status and Party," he was 
curiously silent about gender. 
</p>
<p>2.3. Gender as Central, bu t . . . 
</p>
<p>Another early German sociologist, Georg Simmel, devoted extensive attention to gender 
in many of his best known essays and in The Philosophy of Money (see Coser, 1977; 
Kandal, 1988, pp. 156-177; Oakes, 1984). Kandal describes Simmel as sensitive to the 
fact that male-dominated culture hinders women's autonomy and prevents them from 
contributing to the common culture. Moreover, the standards used to evaluate social achieve-
ments "are formally generically human, but are in fact masculine in terms of their historical 
formation" (Kandal, 1988, p. 158), leaving women to be judged by criteria developed by 
and for men within a context where women are denied the opportunity to achieve them 
(p. 159). Women thereby become the object of contempt and come to evaluate themselves 
as means for others', specifically their families', satisfaction. In a search for recognition 
within a context in which they are denied other avenues, women devote themselves to 
personal adornment and fashion. Simmel recognized that women develop social groups 
to defend themselves against men. Although most often the form such protection takes is 
staunch defense of custom, he also examined the social conditions that prompt women to 
develop groups that challenge male privilege (Kandal, 1988, pp. 169-171). 
</p>
<p>Although Simmel was closer to writing feminist theory than other classical sociolo-
gists, his ideas nonetheless were "ideologically contradictory" (Kandal, 1988, p. 165). He 
recognized that gender differences and the level of gender inequality vary over time and 
space, but he also posited innate gender differences. Oakes (1984) argues that Simmel 
rejected all of the contemporary approaches to "the woman question": traditional, liberal, 
and Marxist. Rather, he posited an inherent difference in male and female "modes of 
being," which are embodied in inexorably opposed, universal, male and female cultures. 
Simmel's solution to "the woman question" is a "separate but equal 'female culture' 
expressed in the theater and in the home . . . " (Kandal, 1988, p. 177). 
</p>
<p>The most recent theorist incorporated into the classical theory canon is Talcott Par-
sons. Because of his focus on normative consensus as it arises chiefly through socializa-
tion. Parsons devoted considerable attention to the family and to "sex roles," including 
several essays and Family, Socialization and Interaction Process. In his description of 
then-contemporary, American, middle-class, family life. Parsons demonstrated sen-
sitivity to the contradictions, inequities, and strains with which women lived, noting also 
that the occupations available to single women are considerably below those available to 
their male class peers. Because they are generally denied the opportunity to combine 
wife/mother and employment roles, and are confined to the "pseudo occupation" of "home </p>

</p>
<p>management," wives' status becomes asymmetrical with that of their husbands. Given a 
society that strongly emphasizes individual achievement, yet strongly values domesticity 
for wives and mothers, widespread tensions and strain are inherent in the feminine role 
(Kandal, 1988, pp. 228-234). Parsons discussed alternatives to the drudgery of house-
work (e.g., perfecting it as an "art," using domestic servants (!), doing volunteer work 
with children and the sick, and the "glamour pattern" of emphasizing sex appeal), but 
concluded that all were problematic. He also recognized that married women could as-
sume the "masculine pattern" and compete with male class peers in the labor force, but 
suggested that this would result in "profound alterations in the structure of the family" 
(Kandal, 1988, pp. 230-233). 
</p>
<p>Parsons' explanation for why family structure and sex roles took the form they did 
reflected his general evolutionary theory that focused on increasing functional specializa-
tion and integration. A more specialized type of family emerged with industrialization 
that, having lost its economic and political functions, became a "factory" for producing 
human personalities through childhood socialization and the stabilization of adult per-
sonalities. Using his famous instrumental/expressive dichotomy. Parsons described the 
contemporary family as an institution devoted to the expressive function. As jobs became 
separated from the household, men came to specialize in the instrumental role of earning 
a living for the family. Because they bear and nurture children, women came to specialize 
in the expressive role, that is, the production of human personalities within the house-
hold. For Parsons, as for Durkheim, this evolutionary process accentuated role 
complementarity (Kandal, 1988, pp. 233-234). 
</p>
<p>For 30 years, feminists have interpreted Parsons' argument as one that not only 
described the then-modern family and explained its evolution, but also prescribed its 
continuation based on functional necessity. However, Johnson (1989, 1993) argues that, 
although not advocating radical family change, neither did Parsons oppose it; he only 
(rather presciently) predicted it as an outcome if married women entered the labor force 
in large numbers. Moreover, although he failed to foresee the looming rebirth of feminist 
activism, he nonetheless was sensitive to many of the inequities and strains that helped 
cause it. Regardless of which interpretation one accepts, it was clearly the case in the 
1950s and 1960s that Parsonian-influenced family sociologists explicitly suggested that 
the widespread employment of married women would endanger the "proper" socializa-
tion of children and the "health" of the family as a social system (Ehrlich, 1971).

<p>2.4. 'Rirn-of-the-Century Feminist Social Thought: 
The Forgotten Tradition' 
</p>
<p>Few women worked as academic social scientists before the mid-twentieth century: how-
ever, a number of turn-of-the-century feminist activists and social service administrators 
in the United States received Ph.D.s in the social sciences and produced writings that 
should be considered feminist theory. Fitzpatrick (1988) describes four, one of whom, 
Frances Kellor, received a Ph.D. in sociology. Another activist sociologist was Charlotte 
Perkins Gillman, whose book. Women and Economics, made her the leading late nine-
</p>
<p>' After this volume went to press, an excellent book was published by Lengermann and Niebrugge-Brantley (1998) 
</p>
<p>that discusses in depth the contributions of more than a dozen United States and European founding mothers of 
</p>
<p>feminist social theory. </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>teenth century feminist intellectual (Kandall, 1990, p. 220). Yet a third feminist thinker 
and activist trained as a sociologist was Jane Addams, founder of Hull House, which 
served as the intellectual and activist center of feminist social science (Deegan, 1988). 
Rosenberg (1982) describes a number of additional feminist social scientists in the United 
States and Lengermann and Niebrugge (1996) list a myriad of European feminist women 
who contributed to nineteenth and early twentieth century sociological thought. Together, 
these founding mothers constitute the largely forgotten feminist tradition in classical 
sociology, one totally ignored in the contemporary theory canon. 
</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this chapter to review the accomplishments of these remark-
able women (see detailed accounts in Deegan,1988; Fitzpatrick, 1990; and Rosenberg, 
1982). Several male sociologists at the University of Chicago, such as Lester Ward, W. I. 
Thomas, and George Herbert Mead, supported the Women's Movement and Hull House, 
mentored female graduate students, and wrote about the topic of gender from a liberal 
feminist perspective. Opinions differed concerning the primary cause(s) of and solution(s) 
to women's problems. Ward, Jessie Taft, and Charlotte Perkins Oilman rejected the no-
tion that the sexes are fundamentally different and focused on the sociocultural roots of 
observed differences. Others, such as Jane Addams, accepted the Victorian-era belief in 
sex differences, especially women's moral superiority. She argued that, given changed 
circumstances resulting from industrialization, by which the role of the family had di-
minished, women sought public roles precisely to express their moral nature. Moreover, 
social progress depended on women achieving them. Taft and Gillman emphasized that 
both genders needed to change, women by assuming more of the rational, competitive, 
adventurous attributes of men, men by taking on the peaceful and nurturant attributes of 
women. However, where Gillman focused on economic restrictions and advocated eco-
nomic independence for women, Taft stressed political and psychological, as well as eco-
nomic issues. In general, turn-of-the-century, feminist social scientists in the United States 
wrestled with issues of the nature, degree, and origins of gender differences, guided by 
abiding commitments to gender equity and to Progressive-era social reforms. That femi-
nist sociologists still wrestle with these same issues will be apparent throughout this 
volume, especially Chapter 3. 
</p>
<p>2,5. Conclusion 
</p>
<p>The theorists reviewed in Part II were motivated to address gender issues by the intellec-
tual and political ferment arising from the first wave women's movement. Although few 
works today considered theory classics met the criteria specified for feminist theory, the 
theories discussed subsequently do. Some nonfeminist gender theory has been developed 
since 1970, notably sociobiology, which is briefly reviewed in Chapter 3. However, I 
confine my review of contemporary gender theory to its feminist varieties, which are 
grouped into four parts: Macrostructural, Microstructural, Interactionist, and Childhood 
Engenderment. Like their predecessors, contemporary gender theorists have been inspired 
by the broader intellectual and political ferment of an ongoing feminist movement. 
</p>
<p>3. FEMINIST MACROSTRUCTURAL THEORIES 
</p>
<p>The theories reviewed in Part III seek to explain systems of gender stratification, or patri-
</p>
<p>archy, at the societal level, primarily with reference to other societal-level structures and </p>

</p>
<p>processes. This part of the chapter is divided into four sections: World Systems Theory, 
Marxist-Inspired Theory, Other Macrostructural Approaches, and Multiple Jeopardy 
Theory. 
</p>
<p>3.1. World Systems Theory 
</p>
<p>General World Systems Theory, which focuses on the outcomes of inequitable relation-
ships between wealthy, core nations and poorer, semiperipheral and peripheral ones, has 
ignored the vital role women play in the economies of Third World countries, as de-
scribed in the huge Women and Development literature (Ward, 1990, 1993). This litera-
ture, which is the subject of Chapter 5, demonstrates that capital penetration of poor by 
core nations usually increases the level of gender inequality. The most basic corrections 
required of the general theory are to cease considering women only as members of 
male-headed households, to cease assuming that household members have unitary inter-
ests, and to analyze women's independent economic contributions as members of the 
global economy, participants in the informal labor market, as household workers, and as 
food producers (Blumberg, 1989; Ward, 1993). Ward (1984) theorizes that the effects of 
Western capital penetration on women's work and status can be understood by examining 
preexisting patterns of "patriarchal relations," which include both ideologies of male 
supremacy and institutionalized forms of male dominance. In addition, gendered assump-
tions made by Western male capitalists in the planning and execution of their projects 
alter the distribution of constraints and opportunities between women and men in periph-
eral nations. Together, local patriarchal relations and androcentric capitalist bias usually 
result in new economic, educational, and political opportunities and resources being dis-
proportionately awarded to local men. Gender inequality is exacerbated further as women's 
traditional subsistence agriculture, trade, and small-scale handicraft production suffer 
from competition with newly developing foreign trade, which is in the hands of men 
(Ward, 1984, p. 21). New opportunities on the global assembly line are often open to 
women, but they frequently are confined to the young and unmarried and are insecure, 
tightly supervised, and very poorly paid. The result is that the greater the peripheral 
nation's trade dependency on core nations, and the higher the level of foreign investment, 
the greater the level of gender inequality (Ward, 1984, p. 40-43). 
</p>
<p>3.2. Marxist-Inspired Theory 
</p>
<p>Although twentieth century socialist nations usually ameliorated women's problems, sub-
stantial gender inequities persisted, a point not lost when feminism reemerged in the 
1960s. Contemporary Marxist-inspired feminists, who call themselves socialist feminists, 
propound a theory that analytically separates class and patriarchal forms of oppression 
and analyzes their interpenetration as a major mechanism that sustains both. They ex-
plicitly recognize that patriarchy predated capitalism, but argue that its form is very dif-
ferent and constantly changing under capitalism. Unlike their orthodox Marxist prede-
cessors, socialist feminists view the demise of capitalism as a necessary but not sufficient 
condition to end women's oppression. 
</p>
<p>Under capitalism, women are responsible for the unpaid work of maintaining and 
reproducing the labor force, work that directly profits capitalists. Like men, they may 
also be involved in the production of surplus value through waged work. One of the major </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 Janet Saltzman Chafetz 
</p>
<p>recent transformations of capitalism has been from denying most women the opportunity 
to become "social adults" through waged work (Sacks, 1974) to seeking them as a source 
of cheap labor in a highly sex-segregated labor market (Eisenstein, 1979). Women are 
doubly exploited by capitalism, in the household and the economy, thereby producing far 
greater surplus value than do men (Shelton &amp; Agger, 1993). The gender inequities women 
experience in the labor market are linked, ideologically and practically, to their domestic 
responsibilities (Shelton &amp; Agger, 1993; Vogel, 1983). Capitalists foster an ideology of 
patriarchy (male supremacy) that justifies women's nonwaged domestic and child rear-
ing work with reference to biologically rooted reproductive differences between the sexes, 
and justifies labor market inequities based on women's domestic obligations (Eisenstein, 
1979). Male workers derive advantages both at home and in the labor market: their wives' 
unpaid services and subservience as well as better paying jobs protected from competition 
by women. In return for husbands' economic resources, wives provide subservience and 
domestic labor, which in turn surpresses their wages (Hartmann, 1984). Thus "compen-
sated" for their subordination to capitalist domination, working class men are less likely 
to develop class consciousness (Shelton &amp; Agger, 1993; Sokoloff, 1980). Moreover, be-
cause wives are economically dependent, their husbands are tied more securely to 
wage-earning jobs, which they are less likely to jeopardize by rebellion against the capi-
talist system (Eisenstein, 1979; Hartmann, 1984; Vogel, 1983). The result is that capital-
ism and patriarchy buttress one another. 
</p>
<p>A variant of feminist socialism, developed by Dorothy Smith (1990, 1987), com-
bines Marxist insights with those of Foucault on the role of knowledge in the (re)production 
of the "social relations of ruling," which include both capitalism and patriarchy. Smith 
analyzes how "male-created discourse" functions to oppress women. Similarly, Patricia 
Hill Collins (1990) identifies white, male-produced knowledge as a major component of 
a racist, classist, and sexist "matrix of domination." To the extent that women adopt male 
discourse in their work as professionals in major institutions, including as scholars, they 
provide "alienated labor" in the Marxist sense that they contribute to the order that op-
presses them (Smith, 1990, p. 19; also 1987, p. 3-5). Smith and Collins relate their 
analyses of domination to broader epistemological discussions that comprise Standpoint 
Theory, the topic of Chapter 2. The relationship between knowledge systems and gender 
inequality is also explored in the chapter on science (20). 
</p>
<p>3.3. Other Macrostructural Approaches 
</p>
<p>Six categories of theoretical constructs provide the starting points for the diverse and 
</p>
<p>eclectic theories considered in this section: cultural, environmental, technological, eco-
</p>
<p>nomic, demographic, and political. Many of these theories are sufficiently complex, in 
</p>
<p>number of constructs and of linkages posited as connecting them, so as to defy brief 
</p>
<p>summary beyond the listing of central ideas. These anthropological and sociological theo-
</p>
<p>ries share a focus on delineating the conditions that explain variation in the level of 
</p>
<p>gender stratification across time and space. Chafetz (1984, Chapter 1) defines gender 
</p>
<p>stratification as the degree to which men and women, who are otherwise social equals, 
</p>
<p>are unequal in their access to the scarce and valued resources and opportunities of their 
</p>
<p>society, suggesting 11 dimensions that may be unequally distributed and an additive ap-
</p>
<p>proach to combining them. Blumberg (1979) conceptualizes gender inequality as com-
</p>
<p>prising three forms of power: political, coercive, and, most importantly, economic, and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Varieties of Gender Tlieory in Sociology 11 
</p>
<p>later (Blumberg, 1984) adds a fourth, ideological. Using a factor analytic technique to 
examine a grab-bag of 52 variables, Whyte (1978) inductively defines nine dimensions of 
gender stratification that vary independently. Clearly, much work remains to conceptual-
ize adequately gender stratification in a manner that enables cross-national and historical 
comparison. 
</p>
<p>Virtually all macro-level feminist theories agree that cultural or ideological defini-
tions of masculinity and femininity (see especially Connell, 1987, on hegemonic mascu-
linity), and of "gender-appropriate" behaviors, responsibilities, and privileges, are fun-
damental components of systems of gender inequality (a topic discussed in Chapters 10 
and 27). Some anthropologists make a cultural construct the most central to their expla-
nations, and of these, Peggy Sanday's work (1981) is the most nuanced. She argues that 
each society develops an overarching cultural orientation rooted in the kinds of environ-
mental conditions most important to the society's survival strategy. An "inner orienta-
tion" arises in relatively benign environments, treats nature as sacred, and emphasizes 
the "female creative principle," as embodied in creation myths which include females as 
central actors. An "outer orientation" arises in more physically harsh and/or warlike 
environments, where nature in defined as dangerous, men's activities as hunters and 
warriors are revered, and creation myths stress masculine progenitors. Each society de-
velops a "sex role plan" based on one of these cultural orientations. The level of gender 
inequality reflects that plan and is highest where an "outer orientation" prevails. 
</p>
<p>Another anthropologist, Marvin Harris (1978), links environmental harshness to 
warfare, female infanticide, and gender inequality. He argues that population pressure 
and resource shortages produce warfare in technologically simple societies, which con-
trol population through female infanticide. Infanticide is made possible by the devalua-
tion of nonwarriors, that is, females, which develops as a mechanism to encourage mas-
culine fierceness and aggressiveness. The level of gender inequality is a function of the 
frequency of warfare and its location&mdash;remote (which may reduce male advantage) or 
proximate (which enhances it). The military as a masculine institution is explored in 
Chapter 25. 
</p>
<p>Sanday and Harris focus on technologically simple societies. A broader range of 
societies is incorporated into theories developed by Martin and Voorhies (1975), Huber 
(1988), Blumberg (1978), and Chafetz (1984), who employ variants of Lenski's fivefold 
typology (ranging from foraging to industrial societies), wherein types are defined in 
terms of dominant technology and related size of the economic surplus. These works 
describe and explain a curvilinear relationship, beginning with very low levels of gender 
inequality in most non-surplus-producing, technologically simple foraging societies, peak-
ing in agrarian/pastoral societies, and tapering off gradually in advanced industrial ones. 
This relationship comprises the topic of Chapter 4. 
</p>
<p>Demographic variables have also been used as independent constructs. As stated 
previously, Harris (1978; also Chafetz, 1984) defines population density as an important 
impetus for gender inequality. Huber (1991) focuses on the negative impact of high fertil-
ity rates on the relative status of women. Guttentag and Secord (1983) discuss the effects 
of skewed sex ratios on women's opportunities to marry and to participate in the labor 
force, on dyadic power within heterosexual relationships, and on women's likelihood of 
collectively rebelling against the system. 
</p>
<p>Randall Collins (1975) links a typology of political structure to gender inequality. 
He distinguishes between nation-states, which monopolize the legitimate use of force, 
and earlier, household-based polities in which it was decentralized into the hands of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 Janet Saltzman Chafetz 
</p>
<p>(male) household heads. In the latter case, individual men have the legitimate right to 
physically coerce wives (and other household members), a variable that, when coupled 
with women's level of economic opportunity, constitutes the most important construct 
explaining the degree of gender inequality. Male violence against women is the topic of 
Chapter 14, and the relationship between gender and political life is explored in Chapter 
23. 
</p>
<p>Economic power, or the extent to which women produce economic surplus, and 
especially control the products of, and/or income derived from their labor, constitutes a 
central construct in most macrostructural theories (e.g., Blumberg, 1984; Chafetz, 1984, 
1990; Collins, 1975; Collins, Chafetz, Blumberg, Coltrane, &amp; Turner, 1993). The more 
economic resources women produce and control, the lower is the level of gender stratifi-
cation. Blumberg (1984) adds the concepts "nesting" and "discount rate." The relative 
economic power of women varies at different societal levels (household, community, so-
cial class, and society), with the broader levels controlling (nesting) those below. Coer-
cive, political, and ideological forms of power, although less important than economic, 
tend to flow from higher social levels downward and are less accessible to women than 
economic power. Therefore, males tend to be more dominant at higher levels, which 
discounts the amount of power women receive based on their economic resources. The 
relationship between gender and the economy is explored in Chapters 15 and 16. 
</p>
<p>Finally, macrostructural theories often include family structure and culture as inter-
vening constructs. Like the socialist feminists, they (e.g., Blumberg, 1978, 1984, 1988; 
Chafetz, 1984, 1990; Collins et al., 1993) define the domestic (i.e., reproductive and 
household maintenance) division of labor as important for understanding women's eco-
nomic roles: the more responsible women are for domestic labor, the less their opportu-
nity to achieve economic resources, and vice versa. Locality and lineage systems are also 
incorporated: women fare worst under patrilocal and patrilineal systems of marriage and 
family (Blumberg, 1978; Chafetz, 1984; Martin &amp; Voorhies, 1975). Family relations and 
the division of domestic labor, as they are impacted by gender, constitute the focus of 
Chapters 18 and 19. Further, secular and religious idea systems reflect and buttress sys-
tems of gender inequality by "explaining" gender difference and justifying male privilege 
(e.g., Blumberg, 1978, 1984, 1988; Chafetz, 1984, 1990). This substantial array of struc-
tural constructs is woven together in complex and varying ways by the different theorists. 
</p>
<p>3.4. Multiple Jeopardy Theory 
</p>
<p>In recent years, feminist scholars have become aware of the white, middle-class biases of 
</p>
<p>much of their work, as reflected in a recent emphasis on the topic called "The Intersection 
</p>
<p>of Race, Class and Gender." This literature is mostly descriptive, although the work of 
</p>
<p>Patricia Hill Collins (1990) provides a basic theoretical approach. Collins (1990, Chapter 
</p>
<p>11) conceptualizes "one overarching structure of domination" that includes, in addition 
</p>
<p>to race, class, and gender, the dimensions of age, religion, and sexual orientation. Reject-
</p>
<p>ing an additive approach to understanding how these various systems of inequality affect 
</p>
<p>people, she recommends that we focus on how they interact. She uses a "both/and" (rather 
</p>
<p>than an "either/or") approach to argue that people can simultaneously be oppressed and 
</p>
<p>oppressor, privileged and penalized; "a matrix of domination contains few pure victims 
</p>
<p>or oppressors" (p. 229). Although individuals and groups may define one form of oppres-
</p>
<p>sion as more fundamental than others that they simultaneously experience, no one form 
</p>
<p>is primary. The matrix of domination has several layers, including persons, group or </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Varieties of Gender Theory in Sociology 13 
</p>
<p>community culture, and social institutions, and different systems of oppression rely on 
varying degrees of interpersonal versus systemic means of domination. All layers are 
sites of potential resistance to systems of domination, as are all forms of oppression. The 
next task in the development of this promising theoretical approach is to delineate the 
general conditions under which: (1) any specific form of oppression is likely to be per-
ceived as more fundamental than other forms simultaneously experienced; (2) the various 
levels of domination constitute more or less important loci of oppression; and (3) collec-
tive resistance is likely to arise in response to particular forms of dominance. A fully 
developed theory of multiple jeopardy could constitute a major vehicle for moving gender 
(and race/ethnicity) to the center of sociological theory, where social inequality, defined 
narrowly as class/status, has long played a fundamental role. 
</p>
<p>4. FEMINIST MICROSTRUCTURAL THEORY 
</p>
<p>The theories included in Part IV focus on explaining the gendered behaviors and choices 
</p>
<p>of individuals, and gendered interaction patterns between them, as outcomes of gender 
</p>
<p>inequality at the macro-level. Four sections comprise this part of the chapter: Network 
</p>
<p>Theory, Utilitarian Theories of Exchange and Rational Choice, Role Theory, and Status 
</p>
<p>Expectations Theory. 
</p>
<p>4.1. Network Theory 
</p>
<p>Network Theory is concerned with the nature (structure) of linkages between actors, not 
with characteristics of actors. Nonetheless, Smith-Lovin and McPherson (1993) use this 
theory to shed light upon issues of gender difference and inequality. They argue that 
gender differentiation begins with what appear to be inconsequentially small differences 
in the network structures and ties of young boys and girls. They review a considerable 
body of empirical literature to show how single-sex childhood networks cumulate over 
the life course, resulting in substantial differences in the kinds of networks in which 
women and men are typically located and the nature of the ties within gender homophilous 
networks. In turn, different types of networks and ties have major impacts on the develop-
ment of aspirations, the level and forms of opportunities people enjoy, and behavior, 
differences summarized by the title of their article: "You Are Who You Know." As adults, 
women and men are different and unequal because of the effects of their current network 
ties, which, although begun in childhood, are potentially changeable.

<p>4.2. Utilitarian Theories of Exchange and Rational Choice 
</p>
<p>Contemporary theories of Rational Choice and Exchange, derived from classical Utilitar-
ian thought, have been criticized by feminists (e.g., England, 1989; England &amp; Kilbourne, 
1990; Harstock, 1985) on the basis that they assume selfish, separative, and nonemo-
tional actors who are presumably masculine, and ignore connective, altruistic, and emo-
tional motivations said to be characteristically feminine. Nonetheless, both types of theo-
ries have provided the basis of feminist theorizing. 
</p>
<p>Social Exchange Theory has been used by feminist thinkers to explain inequities </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>14 Janet Saltzman Chafetz 
</p>
<p>between spouses (e.g.. Bell &amp; Newby, 1976; Chafetz, 1980, 1990; Curtis, 1986; Parker &amp; 
Parker, 1979), a topic explored in Chapters 17 and 18. They begin by noting that social 
structural arrangements function to allow most husbands far greater access than their 
wives to resources that families require and desire. The major, but not sole resource of 
interest is economic, with prestige, superior knowledge, and culturally based male au-
thority constituting other important resources. The higher level of access by husbands to 
resources generated outside the family must be "balanced" in some fashion by wives for 
the relationship to continue. Wives typically provide compliance and deference (as well 
as domestic labor) as their part of the exchange. In a nuanced description of spousal 
exchanges under these conditions, Curtis distinguishes economic from social exchange, 
noting that the former type is based on the advance specification of what is to be traded 
for what. In social exchanges, gifts and favors are given with an implicit understanding 
that the debtor will eventually fulfill some diffuse, unspecified obligation. Because it is 
unspecified, the amount of debt "can be infinite in effect," inasmuch as it is unclear when 
it has been discharged (Curtis, 1986, p. 179). Husbands acquire considerable power over 
their wives because of their superior ability to provide gifts and favors. Exchange-based 
spousal inequality tends to handicap women in the labor force, thereby reinforcing 
macro-level gender inequality (Chafetz, 1990). However, as Parker and Parker (1979; 
also Chafetz, 1980) note, as women increase their access to resources generated outside 
the family, the nature of spousal exchanges alters, often resulting in either increased 
equality or in divorce. 
</p>
<p>Friedman and Diem (1993) review a considerable body of feminist empirical work 
to demonstrate the implicit Rational Choice Theory inherent in it. They argue that three 
central Rational Choice mechanisms are often employed to explain differences in the 
choices made by men and women: institutional constraints, opportunity costs, and prefer-
ences (p. 101). They demonstrate how gender-related choices made by parents (e.g., re-
garding investing in sons' versus daughters' educations), employers (e.g., whether to 
hire/promote men or women in various kinds of jobs), and individual women (e.g., whether 
to be a full-time homemaker) can be understood using these Rational Choice concepts. 
Chafetz and Hagan (1996) employ a modified version of this theory, using the concept 
"satisficing" (seeking a satisfactory rather than maximal level of some good) to understand 
how women increasingly try to balance preferences for individual achievement and for 
long-term romantic commitment and children. Their theory explains a set of family changes 
experienced by all industrial nations (increased ages at first marriage and first birth, 
decreased completed fertility, increased divorce and cohabitation rates) as primarily the 
result of changes in the rationally calculated choices women make as they confront a new 
set of opportunities and an old set of constraints. 
</p>
<p>4.3. Role Theory 
</p>
<p>Despite intense feminist criticism of Parsonian Theory in the 1960s and 1970s, the newly 
emerging field of gender sociology originally called itself by the Parsonian label, the 
Sociology of Sex Roles. This term, which assumes the existence of overarching, general, 
feminine and masculine roles, has since been discredited and abandoned, because it ob-
scures power differences between men and women, thereby depoliticizing the study of 
gender (Stacey &amp; Thorne, 1985), and because it fails to recognize situational variation in 
role enactment (Lopata &amp; Thorne, 1978). However, because so many specific social roles </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Varieties of Gender Theory in Sociology 15 
</p>
<p>are exclusively (e.g., mother, husband) or largely (many occupations) specific to one sex, 
and because women's roles have changed considerably in recent decades. Role Theory 
remains important to the study of gender, as demonstrated in Chapter 12. 
</p>
<p>A major theme in the literature concerning women's roles is conflict between do-
mestic and employment roles. Coser and Rokoff (1982) theorize that role conflicts are 
avoided for men because normative expectations specify priority for employment over 
family obligations. For women, cultural definitions are the opposite, so in cases of con-
flict they are supposed to disrupt their work organization rather than family. Because of 
this, employers often restrict women's opportunities, women tend to have low career 
aspirations and they readily relinquish careers. Female-dominated occupations are struc-
tured to assume high rates of absenteeism and relatively low levels of commitment and 
are therefore under-valued and -rewarded. 
</p>
<p>A recent feminist Role Theory (Lopata,1994) examines the effects of societal mod-
ernization on the major types of roles women play (family, kinship, employment, domes-
tic, community, student) and compares three ideal-typical kinds of women&mdash;modern, tra-
ditional, and transitional&mdash;in terms of their role-playing. While emphasizing the modern 
role pattern, Lopata recognizes that within a modern society such as the United States, 
different categories of women vary in the extent to which they enjoy the opportunity to 
assume modern role options. Women perform the duties of their numerous roles within a 
"social circle" comprising all those with whom they interact in their role enactments. 
Given cultural definitions of various roles, some combinations ("role clusters") are easier 
to negotiate and create less conflict and strain than others. Lopata also explores the rela-
tionship between role enactments and gendered personal identity, using a life course 
perspective to focus on transitions between various roles and the differing levels of role 
salience women experience during their lifetimes. The modern role-player deals with a 
more complex role set, a wider social circle, and greater opportunities to negotiate her 
role performances than a traditional one. In this way, Lopata's theory links changing, 
socioculturally generated definitions, constraints, and opportunities to individually nego-
tiated role performances and identities of women. 
</p>
<p>4.4. Status Expectations Theory 
</p>
<p>Status Expectations Theory explains how gender is related to power and influence in 
</p>
<p>mixed-sex, goal-oriented groups (see review essay by Ridgeway, 1993). The theory as-
</p>
<p>sumes that males enjoy higher social status than females. Both men and women typically 
</p>
<p>enter mixed-sex groups with expectations that men will behave more competently than 
</p>
<p>women in moving the group toward task achievement, that is, their "performance expec-
</p>
<p>tations" favor males. The theory recognizes that the salience of gender is context specific 
</p>
<p>and, in some instances (e.g., when the task is traditionally feminine), performance expec-
</p>
<p>tations will not privilege males. Normally, however, they do and they become self-fulfilling 
</p>
<p>prophecies that result in a reduction of women's self-confidence, prestige, and power in 
</p>
<p>group interactions. Moreover, such expectations are usually accepted by group members 
</p>
<p>as legitimate and, therefore, an individual woman's attempt to counteract them will be 
</p>
<p>rejected as inappropriate by members of both sexes (Meeker &amp; Weitzel-O'Neill, 1985). 
</p>
<p>The outcomes of mixed-sex groups will typically reflect the preferences of their male 
</p>
<p>members, and group processes will usually enhance male power and status (Ridgeway, 
</p>
<p>1993), reinforcing gender-based status expectations in future group settings and the wider 
</p>
<p>society. This body of research and theory is explored further in Chapter 13. </p>

<p>4.5. Conclusion 
</p>
<p>The theories discussed in Part IV explain how gendered differences in resources, oppor-
tunities, constraints, and social definitions, generated at the macro-level, influence indi-
viduals' choices, behaviors, and interaction patterns in gender differentiated and unequal 
ways. In turn, micro-level responses to structured inequality feed back to buttress the 
macro-level system. They at least implicitly recognize that change is possible, its major 
source and direction flowing from the macro- to the micro-levels. 
</p>
<p>5. FEMINIST INTERACTIONIST THEORY 
</p>
<p>The theories discussed in Part V, Ethnomethodology and Symbolic Interactionism, focus 
</p>
<p>on how interaction processes (re)produce gender in everyday life, a topic also explored in 
</p>
<p>Chapter 13. They differ from the theories in Part IV because they focus much more atten-
</p>
<p>tion on actors' interpretations of situations and how meanings are attached to behaviors, 
</p>
<p>and because they imply greater individual agency than the more structurally focused 
</p>
<p>theories discussed to this point. 
</p>
<p>5.1. Ethnomethodology 
</p>
<p>The Ethnomethodological approach views gender as an ongoing accomplishment that 
emerges during virtually all interactions, both within- and between-sex (Gerson, 1985). 
Gender is neither an individual-level trait nor a stable feature of social structure (West &amp; 
Fenstermaker, 1993). Rather, people are constantly re-creating their own and their inter-
action partners' sense of gender as they interact, which is what West and Zimmerman 
(1987) label "doing gender." Gender is "omnirelevant" in that any action can be inter-
preted as exemplifying it (West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1993). Specific definitions of masculin-
ity and femininity vary (in ways and for reasons that are not theorized), but the notion 
that men and women are fundamentally different does not. The taken-for-granted view is 
that there exist two and only two sexes, and everyone is a member of one and only one 
(Kessler &amp; McKenna, 1978). Using a variety of different kinds of cues, people character-
ize self and others by sex ("gender attribution") and then interpret all kinds of behavior 
through the lens of gender-normative "appropriateness." Individuals, therefore, hold them-
selves and others accountable for their behavior as men and as women and are legiti-
mated or discredited accordingly (West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1993, p. 157). Gender (as well 
as race and class) are conceptualized as emergent features of social situations, accom-
plishments whose relevance cannot be determined apart from the context in which they 
are accomplished (West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1995). 
</p>
<p>5.2. Symbolic Interaction Theory 
</p>
<p>Symbolic Interactionism has influenced a number of feminist theories. Lopata's Role 
theory, discussed earlier, is grounded in the Symbolic Interactionist emphasis on role 
negotiation, rather than the more static and deterministic Parsonian concept of role. So-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Varieties of Gender Theory in Sociology 17 
</p>
<p>cialization Theory, to be discussed in Part VI, employs Symbolic Interactionist insights 
on the development of self-identity in delineating the processes that produce gendered 
selves. A number of feminist sociolinguists, social psychologists, and sociologists focus 
on what this theory tradition defines as the key medium through which "mind, self and 
society" are produced: symbolic communication or language (e.g., Fishman, 1982; Mayo 
&amp; Henley, 1981; West &amp; Zimmerman, 1977). This body of work (see Bonvillain, 1995; 
Chapter 9, for a comprehensive review) theorizes that gender inequality is sustained be-
cause men dominate conversations (which women work hard to sustain), whereas women 
use verbal and body language in ways that weaken their ability to assert themselves. 
Moreover, most languages, including English, build gender bias into their vocabularies. 
Fishman (1982, p. 178) concludes: "the definition of what is appropriate conversation 
becomes men's choice. What part of the world [ they]. . . maintain the reality of, is his 
choice . . . , " that is, through talk men create the definition of the situation. 
</p>
<p>Scripting and Labeling Theories are offshoots of SymboUc Interaction Theory also 
used by feminist theorists. Gender is reproduced because the social scripts for many tasks 
are specifically associated with one gender; as people go about doing those tasks, they 
automatically "do gender" (West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1993). The division of domestic labor, 
for instance, provides gendered scripts for numerous tasks that make the household a 
veritable "gender factory" (Fenstermaker Berk, 1985). The gendered scripts of many fe-
male occupations include "emotional labor" (the need to fake or hide one's feelings in 
order to please others; Hochschild, 1983), which functions to deny women an "integrated 
autonomous identity" (Kasper, 1986, p. 40). Schur (1984) uses Labeling Theory to dem-
onstrate how the devalued and stigmatized master status of femaleness results in the 
selective perception of women based on stereotypes, and in their objectification as things 
rather than persons. In turn, objectification allows others to treat women in degrading 
and exploitative ways that produce self-fulfilling prophecies by which women come to 
define themselves as inferior and to suffer from low self-esteem, in-group hostility, and 
identification with their male oppressors. The relationship between gender and mental 
(as well as physical) health is explored in Chapters 21 and 22. 
</p>
<p>The most explicit use of Symbolic Interaction Theory is provided by Ferguson (1980). 
She argues that men possess the power to define both specific situations and the general-
ized other, by which women come to define themselves "by reference to standards that 
brand them as inferior" (p. 155). The result is that women's self-identity is undermined 
and they assume self-blame for their problems. In addition, women become highly adept 
at taking the role of the male other, anticipating his wants and attempting to please, 
flatter, and acquiesce to avoid punishment by the more powerful other (pp.161-162). 
</p>
<p>Recently, CeciUa Ridgeway (1997) developed a fascinating theoretical explanation 
of the persistence of gender hierarchy in the labor force, rooted in an interactionist per-
spective but synthesizing ideas from several social psychological theories. Her starting 
point is that of the ethnomethodologists: the pervasive tendency in nearly all interactions 
to dichotomously "sex categorize." She traces the implications of this for understanding 
gender stereotyping, the salience level of gender in interactions, and the development of 
gender status beliefs, demonstrating how these in turn affect the gendered distribution of 
rewards and of men's and women's relative feelings of entitlement (thus making her 
theory more general than simply an explanation of labor market phenomena). Finally, 
she applies her theory to an analysis of how jobs come to be sex labeled and inequitably 
rewarded. </p>

<p>6. CHILDHOOD ENGENDERMENT THEORIES 
</p>
<p>The last two types of feminist approaches to understanding gender difference and in-
equality focus on childhood experiences and learning, a topic examined in Chapter 11. 
These are theorized as producing gendered personalities, cognitive styles, preferences, 
and values that are assumed to be quite stable and influential throughout life, and to be 
the wellspring from which macrostructural gender inequities arise and/or are maintained. 
The two theories of childhood engenderment are Socialization and Neo-Freudian. Both 
create problems for explaining change in gender arrangements to the extent that they 
stress the lifelong importance of early learning, and both tend to lead to an exaggerated 
picture of the extent of gender difference. 
</p>
<p>6.1. Socialization Theory 
</p>
<p>The Socialization Theory of childhood engenderment utilizes Symbolic Interactionism 
and Cognitive Development Theory to identify the basic processes by which children 
develop "appropriately" gendered self-identities and learn gender-normative behaviors. 
It assumes, at least implicitly, that such identities and behavioral repertoires shape be-
havior across specific roles and situations over the lifecourse because the theory is linked 
with the Parsonian concept gender role. The engenderment process begins at birth with 
sex-labeling of infants and differences in responses to them by parents/caretakers based 
on assigned sex (e.g., naming, how infants are handled and spoken to, nursery decor, 
toys, clothing). The result is that toddlers develop a stable identity as female or male that 
is an integral part of their developing self-identity, and then actively seek confirmation 
from others of that gendered identity (Cahill, 1983; Lewis &amp; Weinraub, 1979). They also 
become increasingly adept at labeling others according to gender. Modeling same-sex 
parent, siblings, peers, media figures, etc., along with positive and negative feedback 
from adults and peers concerning their behavior, teach children gender-specific behav-
ioral norms (Constantinople, 1979). Gender-specific forms of sport, play, and games are 
also important for teaching children gender-appropriate physical, cognitive, and interac-
tion skills (Cahill, 1983; Lever, 1976), skills that traditionally orient females to domestic 
roles and close, interpersonal relationships, and males to employment roles and emo-
tional inexpressiveness (Sattel, 1976). The relationship between gender and sport is ex-
plored in Chapter 26. 
</p>
<p>6.2. Neo-Freudian Theory 
</p>
<p>For reasons that are not clear, interest among gender sociologists in Socialization Theory 
</p>
<p>waned as interest in a Neo-Freudian approach to engenderment waxed, beginning in the 
</p>
<p>late 1970s, despite feminist criticism of Freud as intense as that of Parsons. The theorist 
</p>
<p>who has most influenced feminist sociology in the United States is Nancy Chodorow 
</p>
<p>(especially 1978; also 1974, 1989), who combines Object Relations Theory with a revi-
</p>
<p>sion of Freudian ideas (see Kurzweil, 1989 and Williams, 1993 for reviews of feminist 
</p>
<p>Freudian thought). Although hotly contested among feminist sociologists (e.g., Lorber, 
</p>
<p>Coser, Rossi, &amp; Chadorow, 1981), few feminist sociological theories have been as widely 
</p>
<p>cited as hers. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Varieties of Gender Theory in Sociology 19 
</p>
<p>Chodorow begins with the observation that infant and toddler caretaking is done 
overwhelmingly by women; that for young children of both sexes, their "primary love 
object" is female. Oedipal-stage boys must separate from their female love object in order 
to acquire a gendered self-identity. Similarly aged girls, however, can continue close 
bonds with their same-sex primary love object during the process of acquiring their 
gendered identity. The result is that girls grow into women whose primary concern is 
with interpersonal connection and nurturance, while boys mature into men who focus on 
individuation, deny affect, and strive to prove themselves through social achievement. 
Male dominance and misogyny are also posited as results of the fact that women "mother" 
male children. Using Chodorow's ideas, Gilligan (1982) theorizes that males and fe-
males develop different forms of moral reasoning; men emphasize abstract principles, 
women concrete, personal obligations as the basis of moral behavior. 
</p>
<p>Gender system change could occur from this perspective if men assumed substan-
tially greater responsibility for the daily nurturance of infants and young children. This 
solution is problematic for two reasons: What would motivate the "typical" male pro-
duced by this ( or, for that matter, the socialization) process to become substantially more 
nurturant? Also, would any feminist want to see children raised by individuating, emo-
tionally unexpressive, misogynistic fathers? Miriam Johnson (1988) questions this solu-
tion for a different reason. In response to Chodorow, Johnson theorizes that fathers con-
stitute the primary agents who teach young children gender difference and inequality. 
Children of both sexes become "human" through their interactions with (female) primary 
love objects, but mothers tend to minimize, while fathers actively differentiate their chil-
dren along gender lines. In addition, children observe husband-wife interactions, which 
model gender inequaUty. 
</p>
<p>6.3. Conclusion 
</p>
<p>Theories of childhood engenderment provide an important basis for most feminist 
interactionist theories, to the extent that "doing gender" involves the ongoing search for 
confirmation of fundamentally gendered self-identities. In general, microstructural ap-
proaches theorize in a "downward" direction from macrostructure, whereas interactionist 
theories, at least in part, move "up" from personality and self-identity, both attempting to 
explain how people's everyday choices, behaviors, and interactions are thoroughly 
gendered. In addition, childhood engenderment and most interactionist approaches im-
ply that macrostructural gender inequality is rooted in micro-level processes, while mi-
crostructural theories suggest that gendered interactions are shaped by macrostructual 
inequity. 
</p>
<p>7. CONCLUSION 
</p>
<p>The review of feminist sociological theories demonstrates the rich variety of approaches 
</p>
<p>to understanding gender difference and inequality developed in recent years. They reflect 
</p>
<p>every general theoretical approach in our discipline. Each provides a useful, albeit partial 
</p>
<p>contribution to the solution of a giant puzzle: a full explanation of the mechanisms by 
</p>
<p>which systems of gender inequality are produced, maintained, and changed at all levels 
</p>
<p>of social life. Although some efforts at broad theoretical synthesis have been made (e.g.. </p>

<p>20 Janet Saltzman Chafetz 
</p>
<p>Chafetz, 1990; Collins et al., 1993, Connell, 1987; Lorber, 1994), one challenge for gen-
der theorists in sociology is to continue the work of theoretical integration. A second 
challenge is to explore more fully the effects of gender on all social processes, structures, 
and institutions; to use gender difference and inequality more systematically as indepen-
dent, rather than primarily as dependent constructs. A third challenge is only slightly less 
compelling than it was when first explicated over a decade ago by Stacey and Thome 
(1985): to end the ghettoization of feminist theories by fully integrating their insights 
into the sociological theory canon, thereby incorporating gender as a fundamental feature 
of social life into the basic fabric of our discipline.

<p>A Feminist Epistemology

<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>The tradition of Western science is built on positivism an epistemology of the fact. For 
both natural and social science, the world of experience is generally believed to be an 
objective world, governed by underlying regularities, even natural laws. Facts are empiri-
cal observations, outcroppings of these underlying regularities. If, and only if, we system-
atically and dispassionately observe the data of the empirical world can we detect the 
patterns of which they are evidence. August Comte had such confidence in the principles 
of positivism that he believed it was not only possible but also desirable to build a science 
of society, sociology, upon them. 
</p>
<p>Positivism is the hegemonic epistemology in scientific discourse, so that its specific 
way of connecting beliefs about knowing with research practices appears seamless: we 
often fail to see any distinctions among epistemology, methodology, and method. Harding's 
(1987) distinctions are useful in disaggregating the issues. Epistemology, Harding says, 
is a theory about knowledge, about who can know what and under what circumstances. A 
method, Harding notes, is a technique for gathering and analyzing information, for ex-
ample, forms of listening, watching, or examining records. A methodology is an argu-
ment about how these two are linked, that is, about the implications of an epistemology 
for the practice of research. 
</p>
<p>Every epistemology, Genova (1983) says, involves assumptions about the points of a 
triad: the knower, the known, and the process of knowing. He describes the history of 
Western philosophical debates about epistemology as focused on one or another of the

</p>
<p>points on this triad. Ring (1987) identifies the same three elements, but in her represen-
tation we are drawn to their connection. Epistemologies, for Ring, are accounts of the know-
ing subject, the object of study, and the relationship between them. An epistemology 
directs us in how to approach an understanding of a phenomenon. The basic issue it 
resolves is the grounds for choosing one theory, or account of that phenomenon, over 
another (Alcoff, 1989). 
</p>
<p>At the heart of positivist epistemology is the focus on objectivity. Positivism assumes 
that truth comes from eliminating the role of subjective judgments and interpretations, 
thus sharply enforcing the dichotomy between the knower and the known (Ring, 1987). 
According to positivist epistemology, subjectivity is an obstacle to knowledge: the observer's 
personality and feelings introduce errors in observation. The practices of research are 
designed to minimize and hopefully erase any impact of the researcher's subjectivity 
from the data. Observations are made through a process of objective measurement, which 
circumvents the subjectivity of the observer, allows for the application of statistical analy-
ses, and makes data collection and interpretation open to replication and testing by others. 
</p>
<p>Positivism offered some clear advantages over the epistemology that prevailed prior 
to it, an epistemology based on faith and revelation, an authority based on tradition 
(Lovibond, 1989). The reliance on evidence and clear, replicatable procedures for collect-
ing and interpreting it, open up the production of knowledge to many more than a chosen 
few. The emphasis on systematic procedures presents knowledge claims in a context that 
is open to critique, argument, even refutation. Positivist epistemology has generated meth-
ods with democratic potential. 
</p>
<p>However, positivism has its problems, as has been shown by scholars from Mannheim 
(1936) to contemporary social constructionists who have argued that official knowing, as 
we have inherited it, is not the objective, unbiased, apolitical process it represents itself to 
be. Rather, scholarly paradigms, like other forms of human consciousness, are the ex-
pression of specific world views. 
</p>
<p>For example, the goal of removing subjectivities has never been met. All observa-
tions are "theory-laden;" that is, making any observation requires the acceptance of back-
ground assumptions&mdash;a system of beliefs to interpret what it is that we are seeing. Hold-
ing background assumptions thwarts the ideal of knowing pure facts outside of theory 
(see Bechtel, 1988). Furthermore, when testing any one hypothesis, a scientist is also 
testing a set of auxiliary hypotheses&mdash;all the background assumptions contributing to the 
world view that supports the hypothesis in the first place. If a test of the hypothesis fails 
to achieve the predicted results, the scientist does not necessarily reject the hypothesis but 
can tinker with the background assumptions, arriving at a way to make sense of the data 
and maintaining the original thought. This process, discussed as the Quine-Duhem the-
sis in the philosophy of science literature, portends negatively for a pure test of scientific 
ideas. 
</p>
<p>Extending this line of criticism, Longino (1989) identifies another major flaw of 
positivist logic: the assumption that the data directly support hypotheses. She argues that the 
data do not say what hypothesis they are evidence for. In fact, the same data can be used to 
support contradictory hypotheses and which connection gets made depends on the back-
ground assumptions being made (Longino, 1989; cf. Alcoff, 1989). Because these background 
assumptions are based in values, science cannot be value neutral (Alcoff, 1989). More-
over, as we will show, the values that pervade the background assumptions support the 
continued hegemony of privileged white men. Positivism has become the epistemology of 
the fathers. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A Feminist Epistemology 27 
</p>
<p>The primary contender to positivist epistemology has been radical constructivism 
(see Jussim, 1991). If positivism is the epistemology of fact, radical constructivism is an 
epistemology of fiction. From this perspective, reality is created through discourse about 
it (Weedon, 1987). Thus, the object of knowledge, the truth, is the outcome of the process 
that "discovers" it (Alcoff, 1989; Foucault, 1972; Fraser, 1989; Haraway, 1988). Knowl-
edge is a narrative, a text, even an act of faith based on cult membership (Haraway, 1988). 
</p>
<p>Postmodernists have gone so far as to argue that in contemporary Western society 
knowledge and social domination are the same thing. Foucault (1972) maintains that 
modern knowledge amounts to intensive surveillance of individuals and groups of people, 
creating official standards of normality, and prompting us to monitor and discipline our-
selves to try to conform to those standards (see Fraser, 1989). Our subjectivity is a social 
construction; our values and even our sense of having a self are aspects of the way mod-
ern power works. Thus there is no basis for rationally choosing between one theory and 
another. In terms of the relationship between subject and object, radical constructivism 
dissolves the object into the subject. 
</p>
<p>Of course, it is curious that just when women and ethnic minorities have begun to 
demand a voice in creating knowledge, an epistemology emerges claiming there is no 
truth to be known. Haraway's term for this impact is "epistemological electro-shock 
therapy" (1988, p. 578). It is easy to imagine the effects of such a stance on struggles to 
overcome oppression. If uniting people across diversity requires a shared world view of 
mutual interests, the potential for creating bonds across people evaporates when analyses 
of experiences are considered mere texts or subjectivities (Fraser &amp; Nicholson, 1988; 
Mascia-Lees, Sharpe, &amp; Cohen, 1989). Thus, we might consider radical constructivism 
the epistemology of the sons. But these are not our only choices. 
</p>
<p>2. FEMINIST STANDPOINT THEORY 
</p>
<p>Standpoint theorists begin by rejecting positivism's pretentions of creating a view from 
nowhere in favor of the postulate that each subject is specific, located in a particular time 
and place. Thus a knower has a particular perspective on the object. At the same time, 
this locatedness gives access to the concrete world; knowing is not relative, as radical 
constructivists maintain, rather it is partial (Haraway, 1988; Hartsock, 1983). In most 
versions of standpoint theory there are certain social positions that allow for developing 
better understandings. Marxist epistemology generally privileges the standpoint of the 
working class because their role in process allows one to understand the social and rela-
tional character of production (Bar On, 1993; Lukacs, 1971). In feminist standpoint theory, 
epistemic privilege is often accorded to the standpoint of women and/or other oppressed 
people. We outline the arguments of Hartsock (1983, 1985), Haraway (1978, 1988, 1990, 
1993), Smith (1979, 1987, 1990), and Collins (1986, 1989, 1990). 
</p>
<p>Hartsock (1983, 1985), a political scientist who pioneered the notion of standpoint, 
carefully distinguished a standpoint from the .spontaneous subjectivity of social actors. A 
standpoint, she says, is "achieved rather than obvious, a mediated rather than immediate 
understanding" (1985, p. 132). Capitalists and workers experience the same immediate 
reality and may even interpret it in similar ways. The difference between their stand-
points is that the workers have the potential to get beneath the surface through analysis 
and struggle, to get a different, deeper understanding. Hartsock uses the example of vary-
ing ways to understand power. Capitalists, she argues can know power only as a commod-</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>28 Joey Sprague AND Diane Kobrynowicz 
</p>
<p>ity. However, if workers engage in class struggle and reflect on their position, they can 
begin to understand power as a relationship of domination. 
</p>
<p>Hartsock builds her analysis on a critique of Marxist epistemology, which, she main-
tains, errs in the application of its own logic. She is convinced by the logic of historical 
materialism that to understand people you have to start with the circumstances under 
which they meet their daily needs for food, clothing, and shelter. However, in privileging 
the standpoint of the worker, Marxist epistemology ignores the most fundamental site of 
production, those places where the satisfaction of people's needs is directly produced, 
particularly the domestic setting. Both in wage work and in the home, women's work 
keeps them involved in a world of directly meeting needs "in concrete, many-qualitied, 
changing material processes" (1985, p. 235). This standpoint&mdash;the one of meeting hu-
man needs, the standpoint of women&mdash;is the one that Hartsock privileges. From this 
standpoint, she argues, we are able to understand power as potentially nonhierarchical, as 
a capacity. 
</p>
<p>As Hartsock faults Marxism for violating its own assumptions, Haraway (1978,1988, 
1990, 1993), an anthropologist, makes a similar critique of positivism. Haraway notes 
that positivism is based on the primacy of data, that is, information that is directly detect-
able through the senses. Positivist epistemology is, then, logically grounded in the mate-
riality of people's bodies. Yet, positivism denies the presence of these bodies in making 
its claims to validity. For example, those dominating the production of knowledge in the 
Western tradition have, for the most part, been upper-class, white, and male, and surely 
their observations are shaped by their specific experience. Haraway agrees with Positivist 
arguments that it is through our sensory experience, our bodies, that we have access to the 
world, but that very grounding is both the basis of valid knowledge and a limit on it. She 
coined the term "embodied vision" to emphasize that our vision is located in some spe-
cific place, that our knowledge is "situated" and thus partial. 
</p>
<p>How can we compensate for the partiality of any perspective? Haraway says the best 
way to gain a critical perspective on one's situated view is to know how things look from 
a different position. Access to two ways of looking at a phenomenon reveals the limits 
and constructedness of each. Because each of us experiences life and our selves in mul-
tiple facets that are "stitched together imperfectly" (1988, p. 586), empathy is possible 
and, through it, two knowers in distinct situations can make a partial connection. By 
translating across distinct perspectives and connecting ever-shifting situated knowledges, 
we can rationally build some collective, if provisional, agreement on the whole. 
</p>
<p>Women cross boundaries between perspectives as a matter of daily life. Smith notes 
(1987, 1990). The sexual division of labor, both within sociology and between profes-
sional and domestic work, creates a breach between the means by which we develop our 
understandings of social life and the concrete work of keeping social life going. Thus, the 
standpoint of women in sociology offers leverage to integrate two perspectives. It gives us the 
opportunity to see sociology as a masculine institution that plays a role in the broader prac-
tices by which we are all organized and managed, what Smith calls "the relations of 
ruling." 
</p>
<p>The organization of professional work has caused men to focus on the conceptual 
world while ignoring their bodily existence. This has been possible only because women 
have been providing for their human needs and for those of their children. Similarly, at 
work women provide the material forms to men's conceptual work&mdash;clerical work, inter-
viewing, taking care of patients, and so on. It is as though these men live in an ephemeral </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A Feminist Epistemology 29 
</p>
<p>world of abstract ideas. Never does the mundane reality of physical existence impede 
their thoughts; their thoughts stay lofty and disconnected from reality. Women transverse 
the divide between this ephemeral world and the actual world of human practices, attend-
ing to these men's inevitable material needs. The better the women are at their work, the 
more it is invisible to men, who can thus take it for granted and have their own authority 
bolstered in the process. 
</p>
<p>The result is a sociology that is alienated from social life. Typical scientific practice 
only superficially overcomes the split between official knowledge and concrete existence. 
Smith's imagery is powerful: she says we reach out through our conceptual frameworks 
to pluck bits of the empirical world and retreat to our office to organize the data to fit our 
frameworks. The pictures we end up with are more likely to correspond to official organi-
zational charts than to the daily experience of the front line actors whose practices are the 
stuff of social institutions. Sociological practices "convert what people experience di-
rectly in their everyday/everynight world into forms of knowledge in which people as 
subjects disappear and in which their perspectives on their own experience are trans-
posed and subdued by the magisterial forms of objectifying discourse" (1990, p. 4). Soci-
ology becomes an aspect of the relations of ruling. 
</p>
<p>Smith disagrees with those who say there is no difference between science and ideol-
ogy, following Marx's argument that what is real is people's concerted action to address 
material imperatives. Creating knowledge is revealing the ways practical activity to meet 
human needs is shaped and constrained by social relations of domination, particularly 
those that go beyond the immediate context. Making ideology is letting concepts and 
abstractions dominate and obscure those material relations (1990, p. 34). We need to peer 
behind facts and abstractions and ask how they are the outcome of the concerted activity 
of specific people in concrete circumstances. For example, saying that technology is pro-
pelling us into a future outside of human control is ideology; showing how powerful elites 
promote specific technologies to maximize their social control is not. 
</p>
<p>Women sociologists, especially those with children, dwell in both the conceptual 
and the practical realms; they experience on a daily basis the concrete work of meeting 
human needs, coordinating with child care and schools, etc., and how these conflict with 
the work of sociology. The standpoint of women within sociology means we can and must 
work to transform its practices away from its role of supporting the relations of ruling. 
</p>
<p>Beginning from a marginalized standpoint, one that integrates the perspectives of 
black feminists as academic outsiders and other black women, Patricia Hill Collins (1986, 
1989, 1990) develops a black feminist epistemology that exposes the systematic and par-
ticular character of hegemonic sociology at the same time it offers an alternative. Collins 
identifies four parameters of Black feminist epistemology (1990, pp. 203-218). First con-
crete experience and the wisdom developed out of everyday experience is valued in evalu-
ating knowledge claims. Second, knowledge claims are not hierarchically imposed by an 
elite but rather worked out through dialogue with everyday social actors. Third, emotions 
such as empathy and attachment are incorporated into the notion of intellect. Finally, part 
of the assessment of an idea is via what is known about the character and biography of the 
person advancing it. 
</p>
<p>With this understanding of standpoint theory, we can turn a critical eye to sociology. 
One of our first observations is that mainstream sociology flows from the standpoint of 
privileged men. Before elaborating on the impact of this particular standpoint for sociol-
ogy, we first describe the specifics of a privileged male standpoint. </p>

</p>
<p>3. THE STANDPOINT OF PRIVILEGED MEN 
</p>
<p>There are a variety of accounts of the ways that the experience of privileged men in the 
social organization of white supremacist, capitalist, patriarchal society has prompted the 
development of a distinct form of consciousness. The analyses of Chodorow (1978, 1991) 
and O'Brien (1981, 1989) operate within distinct theoretical traditions, yet display a 
remarkably strong degree of consensus about the parameters of hegemonic male con-
sciousness. 
</p>
<p>Drawing on interview material from her clinical practice as a psychotherapist, Nancy 
Chodorow (1978, 1991) deconstructs traditional psychoanalysis to identify gendered dy-
namics. Chodorow argues that gender differences in structures of consciousness are the 
outcome of the child's development of self in gendered social arrangements: men are 
absent from nurturing in a culture in which gender is employed as an important organizer 
of social relations. Distinctions in boys' and girls' early experiences lead to development 
of gender differences in sense of self and relationship to others: men develop a highly 
individuated sense of self in opposition to others and an abstract orientation to the world; 
connection represents a threat of loss of identity. Women develop a connected sense of 
self embedded in concrete relationships. 
</p>
<p>Chodorow's analysis, like many in feminist theory, gives little attention to the dy-
namics of class. Her clinical data is heavily biased toward the affluent and highly edu-
cated clientele of psychoanalysis, which no doubt explains her analytic focus on the male 
breadwinner/female housewife nuclear family form (see Eraser &amp; Nicholson, 1988 and 
Lorber, Coser, Rossi, &amp; Chodorow, 1981, for critiques). Although the limits of her analy-
sis imply caution should be used in extending it beyond the relatively privileged, those 
same biases make Chodorow's work particularly useful for identifying the consciousness 
of the privileged. Work in the literature on class and consciousness uses words such as 
individualistic and abstract to refer to the world view of capitalists, in contrast with a 
more collective and concrete orientation in the working class (e.g., Bulmer, 1975; Mann, 
1973; Mueller, 1973; Oilman, 1972). Integrating these two perspectives, we see an argu-
ment that the consciousness of economically privileged, European-American men is more 
likely to be abstract and individuated than the world views of men from less privileged 
classes and most women. 
</p>
<p>Mary O'Brien (1981, 1989) uses a historical materialist approach to argue that 
differences in consciousness are the product of differences in the ways men and women 
have historically taken intentional action regarding the material imperative to reproduce. 
To assert social control over a process in which they are marginalized, men in the Euro-
pean traditions she is describing have historically dominated it from outside by creating 
and controlling the public sphere. Men's flight from involvement in the work of repro-
duction poses a challenge to the legitimacy of their control over the process, a challenge 
that is addressed by according the male role as much social significance as possible. This, 
O'Brien argues, is why the dominant patriarchal world view of reproduction emphasizes 
intercourse and male potency and overlooks the value of reproductive labor. 
</p>
<p>Having distanced themselves from the concrete community of people who do the 
work of caring, O'Brien says, men have created an abstract community in the state. Alien-
ated from the concrete history of human continuity across generations, men have con-
structed and sanctified a history of abstractions and ideas. The culture they have repro-
duced encourages a consciousness that is abstract, oppositional, and discontinuous. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A Feminist Epistemology 31 
</p>
<p>O'Brien's analysis resonates with the argument that the capitalistic structuring of work 
leads those in privileged class locations to be more individualized and have a more ab-
stract orientation to the world (Hartsock, 1985; Lukacs, 1971). 
</p>
<p>In summary, whether looking through the lens of psychoanalysis or historical mate-
rialism, feminist scholars identify a privileged masculine consciousness that is highly 
abstract, individuated, oppositional, hierarchical, oriented to control rather than nurturance. 
These themes resonate with Hartsock's description of a masculine orientation to domi-
nate, Haraway's critique of disembodied knowledge. Smith's account of the abstract mas-
culine existence, and Collins' depiction of an elitist and authoritarian epistemology. They 
also seem to run through the kinds of criticisms feminists have raised against mainstream 
sociological theory and research. 
</p>
<p>4. FEMINIST CRITIQUES OF MAINSTREAM SOCIOLOGY 
</p>
<p>Although within sociology empirical research and social theory have long been operating 
on separate intellectual planes, there are interesting epistemological parallels between 
them. Empirical research is dominated by positivist epistemology with its assumption 
that science is independent of the social order in which it is conducted, that knowledge is 
neutral, and that the observer has no particular point of view but rather merely reports 
empirical findings (Farganis, 1986). Ring (1987) describes the epistemology guiding classic 
social theory as a Hegelian empiricism with similar background assumptions. Mainstream 
social theory constructs knowledge as a stream of ideas handed down through genera-
tions of key thinkers who, although singled out as individuals, apparently rise above their 
historical circumstances of gender, race, and class to identify universal rationality (Connell, 
1997; Smith, 1990; Sprague, 1997). In both theory and research, then, our attention is 
drawn to an objective knowledge; the contribution of the knower to the shape of the 
knowing is invisible (Keller, 1983; Smith, 1990). 
</p>
<p>Feminists have criticized sociological theory and empirical research to varying de-
grees, as is true of feminist critiques of science more generally (Keller, 1982). Some 
merely say that research practice has been distorted by its gender biases. Critiques in this 
vein point to the relative lack of women scholars, the choice of questions that address the 
problems of men not women, designs that exclude women, and interpretations of data 
from a masculine point of view (American Sociological Association, 1980). The problem 
from this perspective is that science has not been scientific enough. Other critiques, how-
ever, dispute the very notion of science and scholarship as a distinctive social enterprise; 
the claim here is that science is as socially constructed as any other element of culture 
(Rosser, 1988). We see these critiques expressing five kinds of concerns: (1) objectivity as 
process and as outcome, (2) authority in the research relationship, (3) a hierarchical 
ordering of the social, (4) the predominance of problematic analytic categories, and (5) 
the role of sociology in broader relations of social domination. 
</p>
<p>4.1. The Critique of Objectivity 
</p>
<p>Many feminists challenge the degree to which social research has succeeded in being 
objective and some feminists go beyond challenging whether objectivity is attainable to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>32 Joey Sprague AND Diane Kobrynowicz 
</p>
<p>questioning whether it is even desirable. Likewise, Longino (1989) argues that what we 
hold to be rational is variable but systematically so: "The only constant in Western phi-
losophers' thinking about rationality and masculinity is their association (p. 263)." Con-
temporary notions of objectivity, and the approach to rationality it represents are, it is 
argued, the expression of masculine psychic needs to dissociate from allegedly feminine 
subjectivity and the need to control the threat of connection by connecting through domi-
nation (Haraway, 1978; Hartsock, 1985; Keller, 1982). 
</p>
<p>The first step in the practice of scientific objectivity is to carve up the continuity of 
lived experience to create objects, or facts, to investigate (Shiva, 1995; Smith, 1990). 
Thus, "facts" are the outcome of practices that strip phenomena of the processes that 
generate them, processes that are deeply social. For example, we see gender as the at-
tribute of a person rather than as the outcome of institutionalized social practices (Lorber, 
1994) or of a specific form of social organization (Acker, 1990; Sprague, 1991, 1996). 
</p>
<p>The processes that "uncover" these facts are then hidden from view (Latour &amp; Woolgar, 
1979). For example, experimental methods are held to be the best way to test a hypoth-
esized causal relationship because of the way they control for threats to internal validity 
(Cook &amp; Campbell, 1979). Yet, Fine and Gordon (1989) argue that another way to de-
scribe the practices of experimentalists makes them look irrational, obsessed with the 
need to purge their data of the messiness of real life, and of the contaminating details 
such as people's race, gender, and class. Similarly, social psychologists construct the 
impression of a self independent of context by posing questions such as the Twenty State-
ments Test's "Who Am I?" and treating the answers as facts&mdash;the self is what the test has 
created, not a constant in people's lived experience (Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991). 
</p>
<p>4.2. Authority in Social Research 
</p>
<p>Traditional research carves a sharp distinction between investigator and investigated and 
creates a hierarchical relationship between the two. Several feminists criticize scientific 
authority as the conceptual domination of researched by researcher: investigators turn 
subjects, the people they are trying to understand, into objects who are not capable of 
enlightening scholars about social phenomena (Collins, 1989, 1990). Mies (1993) sees 
danger in dichotomizing subject and object: objectifying what we study can lead to justi-
fying exploitation and abuse, for example in the development of technologies that pillage 
the earth of its resources and in experimentation on Jews in Nazi concentration camps. 
</p>
<p>Feminist approaches have tended to replace models of control and domination with 
those of connection and nurturing. An early feminist assumption was that research rela-
tionships were to be constructed as collaborations (Cook &amp; Fonow, 1986). The researcher's 
goal is to give voice to women who have been denied it, to express their experiences in their 
terms (McCall &amp; Wittner, 1989). Feminists in this camp maintain that establishing a 
relationship of mutuality between researcher and subject of research through self-
revelation and emotional support produces better data and richer understanding 
(Oakley, 1981). 
</p>
<p>More recently feminists have debated the limits of even a feminist investigator's 
empathic ability. Scholars of color have pointed out the degree to which our understand-
ings of the dynamics of gender have been generalizations from the experience of eco-
nomically privileged white women, evidence that investigators impose their own cultural </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A Feminist Epistemology 33 
</p>
<p>frameworks on the data (Dill, 1983; hooks, 1981; King, 1988). As a consequence of 
studying the oppressed through the lens of the privileged, oppressed people are objecti-
fied, represented not as people "like us" but rather as the "other." Minh-ha (1993) is 
describing anthropology as an ideology of imperialism but could be talking about social 
science more generally when she says that what presents itself as an attempt to learn the 
essence of human nature is in practice "mainly a conversation of 'us' with 'us' about 
'them'" (1993, p. 125). 
</p>
<p>The reaction against "othering" has led some feminists to wonder if it is legitimate 
to study a category over which one has privilege, for men to study women or for whites to 
study people of color (see Edwards, 1990; Harding, 1993). Thus, although an early theme 
in feminist criticism of Sociology was its failure to be sensitive to the pervasiveness of 
gender as a social force (Cook &amp; Fonow, 1986), more recent critiques have been reluctant 
to push any abstract category, including gender, very far. 
</p>
<p>4.3. The Hierarchy of the Social 
</p>
<p>One recurrent theme in feminist critiques of sociology is that we tend to employ a pattern 
of selective attention that creates a systematically masculine stratification of social life: 
what is important is what men do (e.g., see readings in Rosaldo &amp; Lamphere, 1974). 
O'Brien (1981), for example, observes that we have theories that address nearly all of the 
major aspects of our biological existence: providing for our physical needs (Marxism), 
sexuality (psychoanalysis), and death (theology and secular philosophy). The stark omis-
sion, O'Brien notes, is serious consideration of the social and philosophical issues con-
cerning human reproduction. Social theory has placed a low priority on understanding 
the nurturance and development of people, and on emotions and intimate relationships in 
general (cf. Aptheker, 1989; Hillyer, 1993; hooks, 1990; Ruddick, 1980; Smith, 1987). 
Feminists criticize sociological accounts for essentially ignoring what Aptheker (1989) 
calls "the dailiness" of ordinary lives, the struggle to preserve quality of life for your 
family in the face of exploitation and oppression, to hold on to and nurture a positive 
sense of self in a culture that demeans and devalues you. 
</p>
<p>A pervasive, and much criticized, assumption in social theory is that the public and 
the private constitute distinct spheres of social life and that the public sphere, defined as 
the official economy, the polity, and related institutions, is more social than the private 
(cf. Fraser, 1989; Mies, 1986; Pateman, 1983; Sprague, 1997, 1988; Ward, 1993). Ironi-
cally and tellingly, the public sphere has then been constructed in such a way that it 
appears to be unpopulated. Interpersonal relationships at work and emotional aspects of 
work itself are excluded from view (Hochschild, 1983). Social analyses that address large-
scale social institutions from the perspective of abstract structures are labeled "macro," 
and are understood as most important. Those that focus on individuals and the rela-
tionships among them, with an attention to process, are "micro," too often with the 
connotation of substantive and intellectual triviality and a suspicious drift toward psy-
chology. 
</p>
<p>The dichotomous, hierarchical opposition of public to private represents relation-
ships as if they did not occur within and were not constrained by social structures and 
makes the structures seem as if they had more reality than the regular relationships among 
people that constitute these structures (Smith, 1990). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>34 Joey Sprague AND Diane Kobrynowicz 
</p>
<p>4.4. Dominant Analytic Categories 
</p>
<p>Another line of feminist critique has been to challenge the analytic categories that domi-
nate sociological discourse. The category that has drawn the most critiques from femi-
nists is the logical dichotomy, the tendency to make sense of phenomena by opposing 
them to others in a construction that is represented as mutually exclusive and exhaustive 
(Jay, 1981). The pattern runs through the history of hegemonic Western European social 
thought: mind/body, city of God/city of man, capitalist/worker, nature/culture, nature/ 
nurture, public/private, macro/micro, structure/agency (Alway, 1995; Harrison, 1985; 
hooks, 1994; O'Brien, 1981; Tuana, 1983). 
</p>
<p>The artificiality of these dichotomies is exposed when one tries to identify the line 
that demarcates them empirically. Rich (1976) notes that even a dichotomy that seems as 
basic as me/not-me is transcended in the experience of a pregnant woman in relationship 
to the fetus developing within her. The demarcating line between public and private is 
exposed as constructed when considering state-imposed policies such as those on sexual-
ity, reproductive freedoms, and violence within marriage (Sprague, 1988). In fact, many 
of our most contentious political struggles can be seen as debates over where to draw the 
border between public and private in a particular domain of life (e.g., sexuality, parents' 
rights, school prayer, assisted suicide). 
</p>
<p>Another analytic approach common to social theory that has come under the criti-
cism of feminists is what might be called abstract individuation. That is, individuals are 
seen in isolation from and unconnected with their interpersonal, historical, or physical 
contexts (Sprague, 1997). A prime instance of this abstract individuation is the tradition 
of representing people as instances of just one facet of the complex intersecting social 
relations through which they live their lives, for example, gender, or race, or class (Collins, 
1989; Dill, 1983; hooks, 1981; King, 1988). In the process we tend to fall back to hege-
monic categories: when we talk about class we see men, when we talk about race we see 
men, and when we talk about gender we see whites (King, 1988). Another example of a 
decontextualized individual is the model of rational man [sic], an actor who establishes 
priorities and sets out to achieve them, evaluating options along the way in terms of an 
abstract value system or their utility to goal attainment (e.g., Coleman, 1992). The image 
hides from us the degree to which most of us, especially women, find daily life an ongo-
ing juggling of competing responsibilities emerging from the complex web of our most 
important relationships (England, 1989; Risman &amp; Ferree, 1995; Smith, 1987). 
</p>
<p>We fracture people even further into abstract attributes or personality traits. The 
practice has been, for example, to ask whether women are more passive or use different 
language than men, rather than asking whether women are more often observed in rela-
tionships in which they are relatively powerless in structural terms and are responding 
strategically to that structural condition (Sherif, 1979). The tendency to explain problem-
atic social behavior by resorting to syndromes (ADHD, alcoholism, chronic fatigue) and 
searching for biological, even genetic sources carries the fragmentation of the human 
being even further (Conrad, 1975, Haraway, 1993; Szasz, 1971). 
</p>
<p>Seeing the social world through logical dichotomies and abstract individuation has 
generated conceptual distinctions that distort the lived experience of many people. The 
disciplinary division of "work" and "family" hides the work of caring for a family and the 
nurturing aspects of many jobs (Cancian, 1985; Cancian &amp; Oliker, 1999; Oakley, 1974). 
The distinction between work and leisure is not applicable to the vast majority of women 
who work the double shift of paid work and unpaid domestic labor (Hartmann, 1981; </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A Feminist Epistemology 35 
</p>
<p>Hochschild, 1989). The distinction between paid and domestic labor is not adequate to 
describe the lives of many women, particularly women of color, who have historically 
been blocked from any waged work other than paid domestic labor and child care (Collins, 
1986; Glenn, 1992). 
</p>
<p>4.5. The Role of Sociology in Social Domination 
</p>
<p>What is the relationship between knowledge producers and the larger society in which 
they work? In ironic contrast to Marx and Weber, who were deeply engaged in the politics 
of their time, the intellectual projects of contemporary theorists are typically understood 
as individual quests to maintain, develop, and extend the stream of ideas. The role of 
theorist is one of detachment, only abstractly connected, if at all, to any sense of respon-
sibility to their communities. Sociological theory has, to say the least, not been engaged 
in contemporary policy debates; its ranks have provided us with few public intellectuals, 
particularly in the United States. 
</p>
<p>Mainstream sociological research has a better record of permeating public policy 
debates. Still, some feminists charge that sociological research is constructed in ways that 
facilitate social domination. Harding has observed that "there isn't such a thing as a 
problem without a person (or groups of them) who have this problem: a problem is always 
a problem for someone or other" (1987, p. 6). She, like Smith, argues that social scien-
tists tend to ask questions of those whose job it is to manage people, not questions of 
regular folks (cf. Fine, 1994). For example, we are much more likely to ask who is likely 
to abuse drugs than to ask what we would need to change about social organization to 
make drug use less likely. 
</p>
<p>Feminists have from the beginning rejected Positivism's ideal of a "value-free" sci-
ence, arguing instead that the goal of research must be to help the oppressed understand 
and fight against their oppression (Cancian, 1992; Cook &amp; Fonow, 1986; Harding, 1987; 
Mies, 1993; Smith, 1987). Cancian (1992) argues that an important feminist methodol-
ogy is to engage in participatory action research (PAR), working with feminist organiza-
tions on problems they have identified in a process they control. In addition to directly 
supporting feminist politics, Cancian submits, involvement in PAR actually generates 
better data by providing localized knowledge about a subject and incorporating quasi-
experimental evidence. 
</p>
<p>Asking questions in hegemonic ways can have deadly consequences, as Treichler's 
(1993) analysis demonstrates. As the Center for Disease Control was collecting data on 
early AIDS cases, the organizing framework was based on the kind of person who got 
AIDS, not on the kind of practices that made one vulnerable to it. The result was the "4 
H's" typology of risk: homosexuals, hemophiliacs, heroin addicts, and Haitians. Further, 
in developing their list, some codes were "master," taken as more salient than others: gay 
or bisexual men who injected drugs were coded by their sexuality, not their intravenous 
drug use. The hegemonic view that sexual practices justify categorizing people and mark 
sexual minorities as deviant led to analyses that no doubt created a false sense of invul-
nerability to this deadly disease in those who were excluded from the typology, notably 
women. 
</p>
<p>An important aspect of knowledge as social domination is the prevalence of "study-
ing down," rather than "studying up." Fine reports, for example, that when her graduate 
students wanted to study upper-class white women they could not find much literature on </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36 Joey Sprague AND Diane Kobrynowicz 
</p>
<p>them. Fine observes that these women are not surveyed by social science agencies and 
there is no "scholarly discourse on their dysfunctionality" (1994, p. 73). Some have ar-
gued that the powerless are aware that official knowledge, rather than serving their inter-
ests, often works against them. This makes them appropriately suspicious of, and there-
fore less than authentic with, researchers (Edwards, 1990; Mies, 1993). 
</p>
<p>Another way that both theoretical and empirical sociology serves the dominant in-
terests is by communicating in a discourse that is so opaque that colleagues cannot read 
one another across subspecialties, much less across disciplines (Sprague, 1997; Sprague 
&amp; Zimmerman 1993). By using the passive tense and speaking in high levels of abstrac-
tion, we hide the agency both of those we study and of ourselves as researchers (Hochschild, 
1983; hooks, 1994). "The author's activity is displaced in methods, which act on the data 
for the author" (Paget, 1990, p. 158). The scientific voice also creates emotional distance. 
Paget (1990) notes the scholarly norm that discredits speakers who show feelings like 
caring, anger, or outrage in the context of scholarly communication. The text is also 
severed from actual human experience, distancing the reader from caring about it, much 
less feeling compelled to do something about it. Hochschild (1983) draws the parallel 
between the emotion work of creating a dispassionate text and the steps taken in an 
autopsy to make sure medical students will be distanced from the humanness of the corpse 
so as not to be disturbed by what is being done to it. The norm of disinterested discursive 
style, Paget (1990) notes, conflicts with the goal of communicating about knowledge, 
which is to persuade. 
</p>
<p>In summary, feminist critiques of sociological practices point to a detachment, both 
intellectual and emotional, from the daily work of keeping life going, from the people 
whose lives we study, and from popular political discourse. They take issue with the way 
we have organized the production of knowledge, noting that it serves more to control 
people than to nurture them. They challenge a reliance on dichotomy and high levels of 
abstraction. The terms of the feminist critique roughly parallel the description of privi-
leged masculine consciousness. As Smith (1990) says, if sociology has a subject, it is a 
male subject. 
</p>
<p>5. FEMINIST ALTERNATIVES 
</p>
<p>Feminists struggling with these concerns have developed some innovative and insightful 
strategies. Arguing that interviewing is a hierarchical form of social relationship, femi-
nists have worked to make that relationship more democratic. They have given interviewees 
control over the topics to be discussed, incorporated self-disclosure on the part of the 
investigator, built an interviewing relationship over time, and asked interviewees for 
feedback on investigators' interpretations of interviews (e.g.. Acker, Barry, &amp; Esseveld, 
1991; Edwards, 1990; Fine, 1994). Acker and her colleagues (1991) use these techniques 
of connection with research subjects in strategic alternation with more detached discus-
sions among investigators, and report that this approach leads to more nuanced under-
standing of respondents' experience and particularly of how people change in response to 
social conditions. 
</p>
<p>Traditional notions of what is and is not data have also been reformed. It has been 
standard practice in interviewing, for example, to attribute the interviewee's hesitations 
and questions such as "Do you know what I mean?" to inarticulateness. DeVault (1990) 
uses them as indicators that male-dominated language does not capture women's experi-</p>
<p/>

<p>A Feminist Epistemology 37 
</p>
<p>ence. She finds these breaks in fluid speech are fruitful gateways for exploration of the 
distinctive experiences of women. 
</p>
<p>The concept of valid data has been expanded in other directions as well. Aptheker 
(1989) and Collins (1990) respond to the elite selection bias of the usual documentary 
evidence by expanding the field of data to include the "documents" of those who are 
marginalized in official discourse. They analyze the messages, for example, in the lyrics 
of blues songs, poetry, quilts, and gardens, as well as oral histories and kitchen table 
conversations. These sources organize experience in the language of daily life, making it 
possible to generate analytic categories that come closer to everyday categories. For ex-
ample, DeVault (1991) found that women's own word for what they do for their families, 
"feeding," combined the notions of work and love in a way that more formal terms such 
as "domestic labor" or "caring" could not (cf. Yeatman, 1984). 
</p>
<p>5.1. Stereotypical Feminist Ways of Knowing 
</p>
<p>By the light of accumulated stereotypes about what makes research feminist, it would be 
easy to conclude that feminist research involves academic feminists using qualitative 
methods to reveal the insights of nonacademic women. In fact, distrust of systematic 
measurement practices, the desire to recognize the subjectivity of those we study, and the 
commitment to empowering women and other oppressed people have led many feminists 
to doubt that feminist research could be quantitative (Cook &amp; Fonow, 1986; Edwards, 
1990; Stacey &amp; Thorne, 1985). Reducing complex thoughts and experiences to measur-
able variables, these feminists argue, sacrifices any sense of the whole, objectifies those 
we study, and makes it likely that the investigator's interpretations will support their 
continued domination. The assumption is that the only way to do feminist research is to 
begin with the lived experience of women and that requires the use of qualitative methods 
(e.g., Edwards, 1990). This reliance on qualitative methods coincides with the reluctance 
to make strong, broad theoretical claims, which would necessarily be generalizing from 
the experience of a few. 
</p>
<p>However, other feminists point out the interpersonal and political problems inherent 
in this stereotype of feminist research. Interpersonally, there is an inescapable power 
imbalance between researchers and subjects of research: researchers have choices over 
their vulnerability to risk, can leave the situation when they want, can choose what to 
report and what to disregard, and have ultimate control over the final interpretation 
(Risman, 1993; Sprague &amp; Zimmerman, 1989; Stacey, 1988; Thorne, 1983). 
</p>
<p>Qualitative researchers' reliance on personal contact in long, unstructured inter-
views tends to draw on small, homogeneous samples and is unlikely to represent people 
with inflexible jobs, heavy domestic responsibility, and less verbal confidence (Canon, 
Higgenbotham, &amp; Leung, 1988). Qualitative researchers have also asked the questions 
and reported in the categories of the hegemonic elite (Fine, 1994). Quantitative methods 
provide some counter to both of these sources of bias through the use of representative 
sampling, giving respondents control over the coding of their answers, and explicit, rep-
licable analyses (Jayaratne &amp; Stewart, 1991; Sprague &amp; Zimmerman, 1989). 
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most negative consequence of an overreliance on qualitative methods is 
what academic feminists have failed to contribute to a broader political movement. The 
point of feminist scholarship is to end the oppression of women. The purpose of knowl-
edge is empowerment, in the sense of enabling purposive action. Thus, we create knowl-</p>

</p>
<p>edge about society in order to support people's ability to work together to make the lives 
they want and need. This has implications for what we call an adequate understanding. 
Social change requires a roadmap, a theory of what is and what should be (Fraser, 1989; 
Sprague, 1997). Democratic social change requires some degree of consensus on that 
roadmap, which means that scholars need to retain criteria for establishing truthfulness 
that do not erode "the persuasiveness of our conclusions" (Alcoff, 1989, p. 99). Reporting 
the numbers can be socially empowering, indicating degrees and/or pervasiveness of in-
equality. Telling the stories of people's experiences can be personally empowering, sup-
porting empathy and feelings of connection. Persuasive arguments in public discourse 
require both. 
</p>
<p>The explanations oppressed people want and need, then, are probably not about pure 
truth as much as they are about how to improve their lives (Harding, 1987). To under-
stand those lives, women and other oppressed people need to be able to see how their 
problems are the expression of social relations of domination (Acker et al., 1991; Mies, 
1993); how the irrationalities they confront are the product of the workings of "relations 
of ruling" that are external to their daily experience (Smith, 1987). Also, since women 
are of many races and classes and vary in sexuality and in physical and mental abilities, 
ending the oppression of women requires working against all forms of oppression (Harding, 
1991). Precisely because the social organization of knowledge has been dominated by an 
elite few, the explanations people need are not the ones they are likely to employ sponta-
neously (Sprague &amp; Zimmerman, 1989). In other words, the goal hooks (1994) proposes 
for feminist pedagogy is not restricted to the classroom: to help people see the connec-
tions between their daily experience and the analytic frameworks we offer. 
</p>
<p>If we need some basis forjudging among competing knowledge claims, if we know 
that scholars are limited by their experience and their particular interests, and if we 
cannot blindly trust the spontaneous consciousness of any particular group, what options 
are open to us? We believe that a stronger, more nuanced reading of feminist standpoint 
epistemology suggests a way out of the trap. 
</p>
<p>6. IMPLICATIONS OF FEMINIST STANDPOINT EPISTEMOLOGY 
</p>
<p>Feminist standpoint epistemology transforms both the subject and the object in the epis-
</p>
<p>temological relation. The subject is a collective one, strategically built on diverse experi-
</p>
<p>ence. The object is a socially constructed one: the meaningful, coordinated activity of 
</p>
<p>people in daily life is what is real. The relationship between the subject and object of 
</p>
<p>knowing is historically specific and dialectic. The metaphor for feminist methodology is 
</p>
<p>bridging. 
</p>
<p>6.1. The Subject Is Collective 
</p>
<p>The epistemological advantage of women is that a sexist society puts them in contradic-
</p>
<p>tory social locations, constructing them as both subject and object. They have an "out-
</p>
<p>sider within" advantage and can play on the friction created by the gap between their 
</p>
<p>experience and the conceptual frameworks that are available to make sense of it (Collins, 
</p>
<p>1990; Harding, 1991; Smith, 1987, 1990). But there is no single privileged standpoint. 
</p>
<p>Because women exist in a wide diversity of social locations based on class, race, ethnicity. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A Feminist Epistemology 39 
</p>
<p>sexuality, disability, etc., the subject of feminist knowledge is multiple and sometimes 
conflicting (Bar On, 1993; Bhavnani, 1993; Haraway, 1988; Herding. 1991). Further, 
women cannot be the only generators of feminist knowledge; men in oppressed locations 
need to understand themselves and contribute to our understanding of their experience 
from a feminist perspective (Harding, 1991). 
</p>
<p>If knowledge is grounded in experience, then we need to recognize and take into 
account the understandings generated by people in their daily life. However, we also need 
to recognize the authority that comes from the experience of having studied something, 
having reflected on it, and paid attention to the reflections of others. That is, those who 
are scholars have to take responsibility for the authority of our experience. 
</p>
<p>6.2. The Object of Knowledge Is Socially Constructed 
</p>
<p>The "thing" we are trying to know from the point of view of standpoint epistemology is 
more than a constructivist nuanced text but less than a positivist open book. Haraway 
argues that we need to see the world not as an object over which we have control but as a 
"coding trickster" with which we try to have conversations using the methods, or "pros-
thetic devices," that help us see (1988, p. 594). The world, including humanity, is socially 
constructed, a product of history and technology (Haraway, 1993, 1990). 
</p>
<p>To say that something is socially constructed is not to say that it is not real&mdash;merely 
a language game as social constructivists say&mdash;but rather that it is the product of human 
activity. If the grounding of knowledge is our experience in the empirical world, then 
practical activity, the work of supporting continued human life, is the bedrock of that 
knowledge. Human activity in the world is real, O'Brien (1989) submits, and so are the 
structures that humans devise to meet the challenges they face. If categories are used to 
direct human social action, those categories are real because we are making them real: 
race, gender, and class are real in their consequences (Thomas &amp; Thomas, 1928). 
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if something is socially constructed it is not the durable, detached web 
of lawlike operations that positivism conjures up. It is&mdash;and we are&mdash;historically specific 
and changeable. Rational knowledge is open ended because the world is open ended. 
</p>
<p>6.3. The Relation between Subject and Object Is Dialectical 
</p>
<p>Given these notions of subject and object, how are feminist scholars to work on producing 
knowledge? Feminist standpoint epistemology implies that the relation between knower 
and object of knowledge is, as Ring (1987) says, dialectical. Our methodology must cen-
ter on "the dynamic between human experience and the material world" and assume 
"constant change, that is, human history" (Ring, 1987, p. 766). Truth, Ring (1987) ar-
gues, will be attained when we have finally eliminated the conflicts between subject and 
object, expressed as the oppositions of ideas to material reality, of consciousness to his-
tory, of thought to action. That is, truth is the outcome of our acting in the world freely, 
consciously, and intentionally. Since we are a diverse community, truth implies working 
consensus on practical activity. 
</p>
<p>To do this, we must strategically structure our discourse, both listening to and learn-
ing from the perspectives of diverse subjects and diverse scholars. This is why Haraway's 
notion of splitting&mdash;making a connection between two knowers in one self&mdash;is impor-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40 Joey Sprague AND Diane Kobrynowicz 
</p>
<p>tant. Mies makes a similar point in calling us to "conscious partiality," balancing empa-
thy with distancing in a "limited identification with the subjects of research" (1993, p. 
38). 
</p>
<p>Because each standpoint and what can be seen from it is limited, we need to con-
struct our discourse as critical conversations. Longino (1989) argues that we construct a 
context for feminist rationality by removing the obstacles to criticism. These obstacles 
include repetitive and unproductive debates about background assumptions, overempha-
sis on novelty and originality at the expense of critical work, and restriction of our com-
munities to those who share the same background assumptions. We have to find the 
courage to disagree with "correct" positions and/or persons and the commitment to en-
gage one another to work toward consensus. We must be willing to disagree and use those 
disagreements as an access to better understanding. 
</p>
<p>Finally, feminist standpoint epistemology implies that academics are not individual 
producers of texts and courses. We are in a social relationship with the rest of the commu-
nity. In the social division of labor, we are cultural workers; our product is understand-
ings. Because the community in which we live and work is organized in relations of 
social domination, the work we do&mdash;the questions we pursue, the strategies we use to 
gather and interpret evidence, and the forms and venues in which we communicate our 
findings&mdash;connects us in valenced ways with either the powerful or with the oppressed. If 
we continue to do it as it has been done before, we will connect with the powerful, not the 
oppressed, whether we choose to consciously or not.

<p>The Sociology of Gender Distinctions 
</p>
<p>CYNTHIA FUCHS EPSTEIN 
</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>The division of the world into female and male is found in all societies. Views that there 
are female and male natures, intellects, understandings, and moralities infuse religious 
and secular paradigms. No less so do views of sex differentiation pervade many scientific 
frameworks. Thus, from the most accepting to those whose mission it is to be critical, 
females and males are believed to possess distinctive innate and acquired attributes, and 
they are seen as demonstrating different kinds of behavior. Such attitudes and perceptions 
may be found in all societies and at all class levels. However, those qualities regarded as 
distinctly male or female may vary considerably from society to society, or group to group. 
In addition, invidious comparisons between those attributes regarded as female and male 
are common. 
</p>
<p>The creation and maintenance of boundaries defining "female" and "male" is part of 
a larger process whereby groups and categories of people create and perpetuate distinc-
tions defining themselves and identifying "others." Boundaries serve to create and main-
tain inequalities in many spheres (Lament &amp; Fournier, 1992), as we see in the near uni-
versal subordination of women to men in public life. Thus, boundaries defining female 
and male (as well as "women" and "men," and "masculine" and "feminine") are widely 
accepted, although the justifications vary and are debated in religious, secular, and schol-
arly spheres. The underlying assumptions for the categories are to be found in the every-
day experiences of individuals, in popular culture, as well as in academic scholarship.

</p>
<p>Yet despite continuity in acceptance of the categories, today there are serious chal-
lenges to "difference" ideologies and frameworks by a substantial number of social scien-
tists who have tested these ideas against people's actual behavior, and by individuals, 
many of them in social movements, who refute the basis for invidious comparison that 
accompanies them. 
</p>
<p>The ideas that are challenged are those that assume men and women act and feel 
differently with regard to a wide range of behaviors and characteristics [e.g., emotional-
ity, intelligence, conversational style, ambition, abstract thinking, or technical skill 
(Epstein, 1985)]. No one disputes that males and females possess different reproductive 
biological organs and secondary sexual characteristics, but there is considerable debate as 
to whether they have different basic emotional and cognitive attributes as well. This chapter 
argues that inborn differences, or even early socialization, may account for differences 
between individuals, but not between the entire categories of male and females. Although 
certain qualities may cluster among groups of females and males, they are rarely seen 
exclusively in one or the other. Furthermore, the qualities seen as male or female in one 
society may be different in another, or vary in different social classes, ethnic groups, or 
even families. With other social scientists, I note that patterned differences may be iden-
tified for females and males, but suggest that they are socially constructed, and occur 
when females and males are conditioned or persuaded to act differently than each other; 
the patterns may persist but they could be changed through policy, law, and different 
opportunity structures. I refer to this as the "minimalist perspective," as juxtaposed to an 
"essentialist" emphasis on basic gender difference. 
</p>
<p>It is important to differentiate between sex differences, which refer to biological 
differences, and gender differences, which refer to the characteristics men and women (or 
boys and girls) exhibit (such as young women's choice of school teaching or young men's 
choice of business administration as occupations) that are socially constructed through 
socialization, persuasion, social and physical controls in the law, in the workplace, in the 
community, and in the family. The social construction of gender is achieved by obvious 
and subtle controls that assign females and males to social roles and social spheres where 
it is believed they should be. These rules (either set by law or traditions) are supported by 
values that specify such ideas as "Women's place is in the home taking care of children," 
or "Real men will fight to protect their family and country." In all societies many people 
believe that females and males come by their social roles naturally, for example, that 
women's personalities are very different from men's in that they are naturally nurturant 
and thereby desire to become mothers and to care for children, and men are naturally 
aggressive and thus are always anxious to get ahead in business. However, no society 
leaves the assignment of roles to chance. There is considerable social input into making 
the roles assigned to women and men seem attractive to the sex to which they apply and 
unattractive to the sex that is regarded as unsuited to them (Epstein, 1988). 
</p>
<p>Culture plays an important role in the choice of life options and integrates with 
economic explanations. Concepts such as "women's work" or "men's work" are powerful 
in making jobs seem suitable or unsuitable for females and males, and strongly contribute 
to the "sex labeling" of occupations (Oppenheimer, 1968). In this way, concepts act as 
symbolic boundaries. Further, structural boundaries reinforce conceptual boundaries, such 
as rules prohibiting men and women from doing work deemed fit only for the other.' 
</p>
<p>Women are certainly positioned differently than men in most societies. However, the 
extent of this varies considerably (Chafetz, 1984), and probably results primarily from 
formal and informal social controls ranging from micro-interactions to formal policies. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Sociology of Gender Distinctions 47 
</p>
<p>The sociological literature shows that there are strong disparities between men and women 
in access to opportunities and resources, for example, more women than men engage in 
low-prestige and low-paying work (Acker, 1990; Epstein, 1970; Reskin &amp; Hartmann, 
1986); women participate less in political decision-making roles (Epstein &amp; Coser, 1981); 
they assume more responsibilities for the performance of family duties (Hochschild, 1989; 
Rossi, 1964; Shelton &amp; Daphne, 1996) and charitable work; and women gain less recog-
nition for their contributions to society whether they are paid or nonpaid. Social psycho-
logical studies alert us to the connection between social position and the cognitive and 
personality outcomes that we observe. 
</p>
<p>Cognitive differences between females and males have been largely disputed by so-
cial scientists using new statistical techniques, such as meta-analysis, as I shall show 
later. Personality differences are more difficult to assess. Males and females do seem to 
show some differences with regard to certain behaviors, such as aggressiveness, although, 
as I shall indicate later, such conclusions often are made on the basis of studies with 
limited generalizability. 
</p>
<p>Today, social scientists and the lay public are interested in the extent to which sex 
and gender distinctions are basic (e.g., part of their "essential" nature) because of biology 
or psychological processes set early in life, or result primarily from structural and cul-
tural boundaries, and are therefore amenable to alteration through changes in law, policy, 
and opportunity. The essentialist belief in basic sex differences has consequences for 
women's position in life and has justified men's dominance and women's subordination 
in most spheres of social life, yet it is unsupported empirically. There are far more varia-
tions within each sex with regard to talents, interests, and intelligence than there are 
between each sex, although it often does not look that way. The small gender differences 
that show up in tests measuring certain cognitive abilities (including math and verbal 
skills) are perceived to be representative of the entire population of males or females, 
rather than the small percentages difference they are, while within-gender differences are 
minimized or overlooked (Baumeister, 1988; Feingold, 1988; Hyde, 1981, cited in Briton 
&amp; Hall, 1995). Furthermore, men and women are often forced to display the qualities of 
behavior, interest, or appearance that a person of their sex is supposed to possess natu-
rally (Goffman, 1977), which may situate them differently (or segregate them) in the 
family (Goode, 1964) and at work (Reskin &amp; Hartmann, 1986). For example, women do 
smile and laugh more than men according to one study (Hall, 1984), but this may be 
because women receive positive feedback when they smile, and elicit anger when they do 
not. 
</p>
<p>Unlike other categories of people who are regarded as "other," such as people of 
color, females and males do not live in different residential communities but often cluster 
in separate domains within them, such as workplaces and places of recreation (Epstein, 
1992; Huffman &amp; Velasco, 1997; Bielby &amp; Huron, 1984). Not only is gender segregation 
often not seen as problematic to men or women, but many people believe that a higher 
order, a higher morality, the good of society, or the good of each sex is served by such 
differentiation (e.g., advocates of single-sex schools for girls, and segregated male mili-
tary schools) (Epstein, 1997; Vojdik, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Such perspectives often come from a cultural bias toward simple explanations and a 
bias toward consistency between ideals and behavior. Thus, most people believe there is 
common agreement with regard to what they mean by "man" or "woman." Yet, as with 
all broad categories, popular definitions and perceptions may vary considerably. 
</p>
<p>Interpretations of the "typical" male and female (as is the case with other broadly </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>48 Cynthia Fuchs Epstein 
</p>
<p>defined categories) also vary according to age, class, and the special circumstances of 
interaction. Assessments of what is typical and appropriate may be perceived differently 
in different settings. For example, in all-female groups women may act in a bawdy man-
ner without fear of being perceived as unfeminine, although bawdiness is usually re-
garded as male behavior, as Westwood (1985) illustrates in her study of British hosiery 
company workers. Yet, in some all-male groups (e.g., in some sports and war), men often 
demonstrate tender and caring behavior that might be interpreted as unmanly in mixed 
groups. When atypical gendered behavior becomes public, however, redefinition or rein-
terpretation about what is "normal" for a particular category of people may occur. 
</p>
<p>Women are not only different within their gender but they may also manifest differ-
ent behaviors and traits in their private lives. That is, aspects of the "selves" may include 
differing and even contradictory components (Crosby, 1987; Haraway, 1991; Nicholson, 
1990; Spence, 1984, 1985; Thoits, 1983); or, they may show different personalities in 
playing different roles. Those scholars who write as if there were a single feminine self 
assume that women and men play out their roles with reliable consistency, as if they 
possessed monotone personalities. They, like many laypeople, prefer the idea of a whole 
person with a body and personality that match. Some believe it to be an indicator of 
integrity. The notion of oneness not only also fits cultural stereotypes but fits neatly into 
scientific categories that one can run through a computer or code on a data sheet (such as 
running "sex" as a variable with the underlying assumption that being male or female 
accounts for a behavior). Sometimes, of course, roles are consistent, or people may high-
light one dimension of their "self for political or personal purposes (e.g., Hispanic or 
senior citizen) to differentiate themselves from others. Thus, people may concentrate on 
the traits that differentiate themselves from others, not those they share, a common prob-
lem in the politics of many institutions such as the family and the workplace. 
</p>
<p>2. EXPLAINING THE ORIENTATION TOWARD DIFFERENCES 
</p>
<p>The persistent emphasis on differences between women and men with regard to their 
basic nature (cognitive and emotional)&mdash;whether it comes from scholars who identify 
themselves as feminists or nonfeminists&mdash;may be attributed to various factors: (1) inat-
tention to the evidence that shows similarities rather than differences between the sexes; 
(2) incomplete and inappropriate models, such as those assuming a sex-differentiated 
"human nature"; (3) an ideological agenda; (4) confusion between cause and effect, such 
as regarding sex segregation at work as "natural" rather than the result of biases that 
force men and women into sex-labeled occupations; and (5) focus on sex as the primary 
determining variable that explains behavior. Many of these overlap (Epstein, 1991). 
</p>
<p>It was only in the last 30 years that essentialism was seriously questioned, although 
as far back as Plato, there have been philosophers who suggested that women might be fit 
to fill positions held by men (Okin, 1979). The goal of many feminist scholars who be-
came interested in gender studies beginning in the late 1960s was to question assump-
tions about women's and men's attributes, to actually measure them, and to objectively 
report observed differences between women and men. Many also wished to uncover in-
equalities faced by women and men that related to their sex. Many scholars motivated by 
the women's movement viewed the mission as one oriented to documenting Betty Friedan's 
(1963) assumption that "Women were really people&mdash;no more, no less" (Johnson, 1996). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Sociology of Gender Distinctions 49 
</p>
<p>No one argued then or argues now that women and men experience the same treatment or 
live the same kinds of lives, although women and men are found to face many of the same 
privileges and restrictions of their race, ethnicity, education, and class peers. 
</p>
<p>However, the explanatory frameworks used to account for observed differences and 
gender inequality have evoked contentious debate. These debates have been engaged in 
within an historical context in which the reporting of sex differences is often biased in the 
direction of differences rather than similarities in characteristics and behavior between 
the sexes. Scholars, as well as journalists, proclaim difference (no matter how small) in 
ways that imply mutually exclusive qualities between women and men. Sometimes this 
work suggests support for the perspective that women are inferior to men because they 
are not capable of engaging in the activities with which men are associated (such as 
working as engineers and scientists), but more recently it has been used to suggest women's 
superiority in some attributes such as morality (see Epstein, 1988 for a discussion of this). 
Further, studies that report support for conventional views of women's personalities and 
abilities are more often reported by the press (James, 1997), but those indicating positive 
outcomes of women's unconventional behavior (such as superior mental health of em-
ployed women compared to homemakers) have been given short shrift by the media. The 
journalist and scholar Susan Faludi (1991) reports that the press failed (and continues to 
fail) to report paradigms and studies showing gender similarity and the positive outcomes 
of the changing social roles of women and men. Yet, in recent years, "difference" has 
been accepted by some feminist scholars and used to evaluate women as better than men 
on issues of "connection" or empathy (Gilligan, 1982), or to suggest that they have alter-
native modes of understanding (Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, &amp; Tarule, 1986; Tannen 
1990). I have detailed the evidence elsewhere (Epstein, 1988) for rejecting the view that 
women have basically different abilities than men. This view is also supported by com-
prehensive reviews by Aries (1996), Hyde (1990a), Feingold (1992), and by Tavris (1992), 
who wisely concluded in her book The Mismeasure of Woman, " . . . women are not the 
better sex, the inferior sex, or the opposite sex." Yet there has been an enormous spillover 
effect from the work of Gilligan (1982), who suggested that women are predisposed to an 
ethic of "care," into many fields, including legal studies and educational theory. The idea 
that women have "different way of knowing" has been developed also by social philoso-
phers, such as( Harding 1986), and by the historian of science Keller (1978) (see also 
Belenky et al , 1986). 
</p>
<p>2.1. Theoretical Frameworks 
</p>
<p>The perception of gender distinctions (or gender similarities) is affected by theoretical 
frameworks and the assumptions inherent in them. Of course, theoretical frameworks 
affect all human thinking, including the very idea of gender&mdash;a theoretical construct. But 
analysts must be alert to the biases any framework brings to the way we see and under-
stand behavior. Because gender analysis has been drawn from a number of theoretical 
camps, in the sciences and the humanities, as discussed in Chapter 1, observations of 
males and females and the conclusions drawn from them are often influenced by the 
theoretical bias of the researcher. Implicit in any of these gender are assumptions regard-
ing how essential or minimal are gender differences in humans. Some theoretical per-
spectives have met serious challenge because empirical data do not support them; some </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>50 Cynthia Fuchs Epstein 
</p>
<p>are not tested or even testable; and some seem promising. To illustrate, some of the theo-
ries that shape perception of male and female differences are theories of personality (e.g., 
trait theory, which suggests people have particular stable personality traits); learning and 
development (e.g., socialization theory, which is oriented to the individual's internaliza-
tion of qualities such as nurturance because of early experiences); sociobiology (e.g., 
biological determinism); evolutionary biology (the notion that natural selection accounts 
for gender differences); social construction (the model that points to the impact of social 
factors on an individual's behavior and attitudes); and postmodern theories (which offer 
a model of human nature as one of multiplicity and change). The perspective of this 
chapter that seems most supported by research is the social constructionist model and 
part of the postmodern paradigm. I outline some of the arguments below. 
</p>
<p>One of the most salient examples of the orientation toward a "difference" or "essen-
tialist" view is the sociobiological approach. As in the case of race (Gould, 1981), social 
scientists have often sought to support claims to women's inferiority (Fausto-Sterling, 
1985) or "otherness" with regard to cognitive and emotional factors (Sherman &amp; Beck, 
1979). For example, recently biological determinants of sex differences, particularly brain 
studies (see Fausto-Sterling, 1997), have been referred to for the purpose of showing the 
source of reported differences ranging from test scores in mathematics to "women's ways 
of leading." Rosener (personal communication) claims that biology is part of the expla-
nation for the different leadership styles she argues women demonstrate (1995). Yet, as 
Tavris (1992) points out, citing the work of Hyde and Linn (1988) and other scientists, 
there are virtually no differences in the attributes that brain differences are supposed to 
explain, and more importantly, the brain studies themselves have been criticized for their 
method: some are done on rats; some are done with mentally ill or otherwise aberrant 
subjects; all use tiny samples; and few highlight the overlaps between the sexes (Fausto-
Sterling, 1997). Furthermore, general tests of intelligence have never found differences 
between the sexes on measures of I.Q. (Hyde, 1990a). 
</p>
<p>Holding that women and men act differently because they use basically different 
reproductive strategies has many challengers among both social and physical scientists. 
For example, Stephen Jay Gould (1997), a paleontologist who is well known for his 
critique of biases within science regarding race, disputes the idea that the causes of be-
havior such as occupational choice may be traced to reproductive strategies of a species. 
Donna Haraway (1989), a philosopher of science, also offers a useful illustration of the 
pitfalls of these adaptions. She has shown that when feminist sociobiologists use evolu-
tionary models to explain present-day differentiation of duties and responsibilities, as 
well as other behavior, they are exercising the same biases as antifeminist male anthro-
pologists. Building on Haraway, one can identify feminist scholars whose essentialist 
models are derived from male scholars with biased outlooks regarding sex differentia-
tion, such as can be found in the work of anthropologist Sandra Hrdy (1977), whose work 
builds on that of E. O. Wilson, the sociobiologist. 
</p>
<p>The difference or essentialist model is less prevalent among the postmodern theo-
rists. They reject absolute categories and reject dichotomous thinking, such as that which 
places "male" and "female" into mutually exclusive categories. Their perspective orients 
the scholar to recognizing the differences between people within groups, and their multi-
plicity of experience and character. However, they reject the methods of science and thus 
confirmation or disconfirmation by the use of research. The paradigm that emphasizes 
the "social construction" of human behavior incorporates the benefits of the postmodern </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Sociology of Gender Distinctions 51 
</p>
<p>approach and allows for support or rejection of hypotheses about sex difference and simi-
larity through observation of actual behavior in the empirical world. 
</p>
<p>2.2 Methodological Problems 
</p>
<p>Because scholarship on difference is framed by researchers and theorists in many fields 
and orientations, outcomes of this research are not consistent. However, "findings" are 
often cited across fields without attention to the methodology that produced them. Not 
only do some scholars use different standards of proof, but many also deny that proof is 
even obtainable; yet nevertheless they make claims for basic differences. For example, 
many scholars from the humanities look for "evidence" in support of their theories from 
personal experience or the narratives of individuals, and some use novels or myths as 
"evidence." The theories of humanists have been adopted by a number of social scientists 
with an essentialist orientation. Many psychologists use laboratory experiments with col-
lege students and generalize to the entire category of male or female, but their findings 
may not be applicable to males and females who are older or who have not gone to 
college. Similarly, experiments with rats may not apply at all to the human experience 
with its heavy overlay and interaction with culture. 
</p>
<p>Although always suggestive, for generalizability the findings of all studies should be 
approached with caution, especially with regard to their claims. Personal experiences 
may be unreliable because they may be recalled in a way that fits a normative picture. The 
use of objective techniques (however much they fall short of an objective ideal), such as 
the use of sampling with control groups, reveals much more similarity than difference 
between men and women. 
</p>
<p>As noted previously, similarities between the sexes with regard to cognitive and 
emotional qualities have been shown by analyzing clusters of studies and assessing their 
relative merit. Most of these (but not all; see Eagly 1996) show not only extensive be-
tween-sex overlap but that differences once found at the ends of distributions have been 
decreasing with time. The changes are probably due to changes in social conditions 
(Feingold, 1992), such as the opening of training and job opportunities for women in 
fields from which they were largely excluded in the past. In fact, it may be that claims of 
large-scale differences between females and males in the past have had the social conse-
quence of contribution to whatever differences can still be identified through tests, obser-
vations, and other indicators because of a self-fulfilling prophecy (Merton, 1957). 
</p>
<p>2.3. Meaningful Differences 
</p>
<p>The magnitude of difference in behaviors preferences of men and women is also impor-
</p>
<p>tant to consider when establishing how meaningful a quality might be in differentiating 
</p>
<p>the sexes. Usually, large differences would be the measure of meaningful sex variation. 
</p>
<p>However, studies might show statistically significant differences when the actual differ-
</p>
<p>ences might be quite tiny, and thus socially insignificant. Thus, the purpose of the in-
</p>
<p>quiry ought to determine social and not merely statistical "significance." As an example, 
</p>
<p>politicians are usually concerned with otherwise insignificant differences between groups 
</p>
<p>because a tiny difference can determine the results of an election. From a social science </p>

</p>
<p>point of view, it is the case that between-sex differences are far smaller than within-sex 
differences. For example, in the 1996 congressional race, 55% of women voted for Demo-
crats compared to 46% of men, according to a New York Times poll {New York Times, 
November 7, 1996)&mdash;the notable "gender gap." The focus is on the 9% who voted differ-
ently and not the 91% who voted the same. In the 1992 Presidential race the disparity 
between males and females was even less&mdash;6%. As Hout and his colleagues point out 
(Hout, Brooks, &amp; Manza, 1995), class differences in voting patterns are twice as large as 
gender difference. 
</p>
<p>Most reporting that refers to "women" and "men" as unitary collectivities does not 
make note of the spread of preferences or capacities found within each category and is 
usually based on very small percentage differences. The reporting indicates an ignorance 
of how to interpret a statistical distribution. It refers to categories as if they were mutually 
exclusive, such as "black" and "white." As in the case of sex, in defining a racial cat-
egory, many of the same kinds of conceptualizations are understood to be real representa-
tions that are in fact not descriptive of individuals within a group (e.g., racial laws in 
some states classified individuals as black when they had one-sixteenth black "blood," 
and could have more easily described such an individual as "white.") Similarly, using 
small differences to distinguish "male" or "female" behavior (often not more than a two 
or three percentage point difference) or any observed characteristic is enough to convince 
people that a particular man or woman can be located at the end of the distribution where 
those small differences lie (Sherif, 1979). 
</p>
<p>The problem of the method used to assess difference is great, as can be illustrated 
through examination of the research in two areas, leadership and aggression. 
</p>
<p>It is widely believed that women and men have different styles of leadership (Rosener, 
1995), although subordinates of women leaders (Aries, 1996. p. 67) and colleagues (Dob-
bins &amp; Platz, 1986; Nieva &amp; Gutek, 1982; Powell, 1988) indicate that they exhibit the 
same range of behaviors as men. However, some studies show differences whereas other 
studies show great similarities in the behavior of women and men. Some studies also 
indicate that individuals' reports on their own behavior is inconsistent with the reports of 
observers. For example, in one study women reported that they demonstrated less domi-
nant and competitive behavior than men, but the researcher observed no difference 
(Snodgrass &amp; Rosenthal, 1984). Other studies found no gender differences in dominance 
and competitive behavior (Chanin &amp; Schneer, 1984; Rahim, 1983). In another study 
(Korabik, Baril, &amp; Watson, 1993) experienced managers of both sexes failed to reveal 
differences in self-reported conflict management style. However, self-reports about pre-
ferred conflict management style are poor predictors of actual behaviors (Baril, Korabik, 
Watson, Grencavage, &amp; Gutkowski, 1990; Bass, 1990; Korabik et al., 1993). It is inter-
esting that among 374 studies of leadership styles, only 37 were observation studies and 
the rest were self reports (Aries, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Even when the management styles of women and men are similar, there may be a 
perception, and consequent evaluation of that style based on gender. For example, the 
study of gender differences in management style and leadership effectiveness by Korabik 
et al. (1993) revealed that although there were no gender differences in their manage-
ment styles, male and female supervisors were evaluated differently. 
</p>
<p>Thus we see that although some men and women leaders report similar styles, others 
do not. Moreover, in many cases individuals report behaviors that conform to stereotypes 
for their sex, although observers report that they behave quite differently than their self-
descriptions suggest. Because there is widespread belief in difference, many books and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Sociology of Gender Distinctions S3 
</p>
<p>conferences are devoted to women's presumed different styles (see Belenky et al., 1986; 
Gilligan, 1982; Harding, 1986; Keller, 1978; Rosener, 1995; Smith, 1990; Tannen, 1990). 
Furthermore, male superiors believe women behave differently and thus offer them jobs 
in human resources and exclude them from staff jobs that would give them the experience 
to rise in a corporation (Kanter, 1977). 
</p>
<p>Aggression has been identified as a trait found to occur more in males than in fe-
males (Maccoby &amp; Jacklin, 1974). It is important to examine this concept because ag-
gression is supposed to account for the domination of men in the power structure of 
society and in their relations with women.^ Yet the very term "aggression" refers to a 
loose collection of behaviors and attitudes that are often unrelated to one another [as a 
review by Brinkerhof and Booth (1984) points out]. Predation, initiative, competition, 
dominance, territorial behavior, and hostility are among the behaviors considered in studies 
of aggression. A comprehensive review of hundreds of experimental studies on adult 
female and male aggression by Frodi, Macaulay, and Thome (1977) shows that it is diffi-
cult to make a clear assessment of differences on all these dimensions. First, the studies 
are not all comparative and over half are studies of men only. Many studies tend to be of 
children or college students; however, it has been found that differences noted between 
boys and girls, especially preschoolers, tend to become small by adulthood (Hyde, 1990a). 
An overview (McKenna &amp; Kessler, 1974) shows that of more than 80 general and theo-
retical discussions of aggression in books and journals, references to studies do not specify 
the magnitude of differences and whether they are large enough to warrant characterizing 
women as less aggressive than men. Using a meta-analysis, Eagly (1987), has shown that 
aggressive and nonaggressive behaviors are tied to social roles (see also Hyde, 1990); 
men are required to show aggression, when, for example, they work as soldiers or even 
bonds tradesmen, but women are required not to be aggressive as teachers or nurses. 
Nonetheless, men working as social workers are required to be nonaggressive and women 
firefighters are supposed to charge into dangerous situations. Other studies show that 
women are often the same or harsher than men with regard to verbal aggression or hostil-
ity (Epstein, 1988). 
</p>
<p>2.4. Choice of Indicators 
</p>
<p>"Male" and "female" or "masculine" and "feminine" are general concepts. How they are 
defined, however, varies in different groups and different cultures. Definitions of male 
and female often follow stereotypes and may not accurately reflect the actual behavior of 
men and women or the range of behaviors exhibited by each sex. For example, women are 
regarded as emotional and men as unemotional in American society, yet the opposite is 
true in Iran (Epstein, 1970). Probably both sexes, in all societies, manifest "emotion" 
publicly according to the norms that encourage or discourage such behavior and may not 
reflect their internal states. 
</p>
<p>"Male" and "female" are usually based on a composite of factors that seem to go 
together. For example, women are believed to be nurturant, self-sacrificing, and sociable. 
There is an underlying assumption that these are stable characteristics and consistent 
across situations. Many researchers assume stability when they study people at a particu-
lar point in time. This constitutes a bias in perspective that reflects the fact that individu-
als may vary over the course of a day, or a lifetime. It fails to recognize that individuals 
are complicated, and their behaviors are not necessarily consistent. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>54 Cynthia Fuchs Epstein 
</p>
<p>2.5. Attributes as Interactional 
</p>
<p>Most behavior identified as male and female is seen in interactional settings (Deaux &amp; 
Major, 1987; Ridgeway, 1997). Individuals in interaction may put pressure on each other 
to conform to an expected behavior that is in line with a stereotype. For example, in my 
research on women in the legal profession, some women attorneys reported that male 
judges ordered them to smile. Of course, they had to respond to the order. This shows how 
the status and rank of the person with whom a female or male is interacting will cause 
adjustments in behavior. Females and males may therefore act quite differently when 
alone; with an age peer; or with a person who is older, with more power, and in a norma-
tively defined role relationship. How "female" or "male" one is may very much depend on 
one's interactional partner. Thus, research centered on single events rarely captures the 
complexity created by the feedback effects of individuals in social settings. 
</p>
<p>2.6. Inattention to Variables Other than Sex 
</p>
<p>Power, age, social status, and ethnicity all structure how gender-related behaviors play 
out, and how they also vary in particular situations and historical periods. Therefore, 
researchers need to go beyond identifying the sex of a person and note the other charac-
teristics that may account for his or her behavior. For, women who hold positions of 
authority are usually more assertive than women in powerless jobs. This is not because 
they become "like men," but because the positions require assertiveness and women learn 
to act in that manner. Similarly, men in subordinate positions are not "like women" when 
they defer to a boss; they are playing their role according to the rules. Characteristics 
thought of as "male" or "female" are also embedded in a life cycle and time framework. 
In any concrete situation in which maleness and femaleness are being assessed or ob-
served, females and males of particular ages are being observed. Yet women and men 
often exhibit very different characteristics at young, middle, and older ages, women often 
gaining in authority, and men often demonstrating more nurturing qualities after retire-
ment or during child rearing years if they take on child care responsibility (Brody, 1997). 
</p>
<p>The issue of the life course is of great interest because, as noted previously, many 
studies that define male and female behavior are based on studies conducted in schools or 
laboratory settings (using school-aged children or young adults). Yet youngsters may 
change their "character" either through maturity, developmental changes, socialization, 
or acquisition of different roles. 
</p>
<p>2.7. Impact of Social Change on Gendered Behavior 
</p>
<p>Many views about females and males are tied to particular time periods. Tastes change in 
</p>
<p>popular culture and with them, men's and women's behavior. Some practices change 
</p>
<p>because legal changes open women's options. Other practices change because social con-
</p>
<p>ditions permit or repress certain kinds of activity. This phenomenon is too extensive to 
</p>
<p>document in this chapter, but a few examples illustrate the social construction of what are 
</p>
<p>believed to be immutable sex-related behaviors. 
</p>
<p>As noted earlier, aggression is taken to be a defining characteristic of males and not 
</p>
<p>females, yet its expression changes in form and incidence in different time periods. Norms </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Sociology of Gender Distinctions 55 
</p>
<p>regarding the appropriateness of women expressing aggression also change in societies 
(Zuckerman, Cole, &amp; Bruer, 1991). Many feminist historians have documented women's 
assertiveness in labor union activity at certain points and places in history (Costello, 
1991; Turbin, 1992; Vallas, 1993), yet traditionally public collective action was associ-
ated with men and not women. 
</p>
<p>Interest in and use of guns may be a good indicator of aggression and assertiveness. 
The use of firearms has been considered a natural prerogative of men, and people look to 
its sources in the play behavior of boys who often "turn" objects into guns and play "cops 
and robbers." This is used as an example of men's "natural" aggression and women's 
"natural" passivity. Nonetheless, girls and women now are more interested in guns than 
in the past. A significant number take target practice and they comprise 15% to 20% of 
the National Rifle Association membership (Epstein, 1995a). That organization even 
elected its first woman president in 1995 (Wall Street Journal, May 22, 1995). In Israel, 
women, who are conscripted into the army, commonly train with guns (unless they are 
religiously orthodox, in which case they are not required to join the army). 
</p>
<p>In the United States, women and men choose to go to medical and law schools in 
almost equal numbers (Epstein, 1993), a radical change from the time when it was be-
lieved that women did not enjoy the conflict of the courtroom (Epstein, 1993) or the 
challenge of the operating room (Lorber, 1984). In 1963 women constituted only 3.8% of 
entering classes in professional schools (Epstein, 1981) and it was believed that women 
had no interest in medicine or the law. Today, they constitute more than 40% of students 
in these professional schools. 
</p>
<p>Conversations between men and women have received much attention recently, partly 
because of Deborah Tannen's (1990) popular book. You Just Don't Understand, which 
was on the best seller lists for many weeks. This book implies that basic differences lead 
to a "two worlds" approach to gender interaction. However, studies of speech show that 
men's and women's voices are influenced by social expectations and social control. For 
example, a recent article in the Wall Street Journal reported that "elevator girls" in Japan 
who had been required to speak in a high-pitched voice deemed essentially feminine are 
now permitted to speak in a more natural, lower-moderated tone. 
</p>
<p>2.8. The Multiple Attributes of Men and Women 
</p>
<p>In associating various qualities with men or women, little attention is given to how much 
</p>
<p>of the attribute they display. Yet people may display normative attributes for their sex in 
</p>
<p>situations that demand it and not in situations in which they are not subject to controls. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, they may internalize some of the characteristics in greater or lesser amounts. 
</p>
<p>It is entirely possible for a person to feel or be a little nurturant or very nurturant; one can 
</p>
<p>be aggressive occasionally or very often and one may alternate such qualities in one's 
</p>
<p>various social roles, or even within the same role. For example, some mothers may be 
</p>
<p>loving toward their children, looking out for their interests, yet harsh and punitive in 
</p>
<p>their use of corporal punishment, depending on the cultural practices of their group [as 
</p>
<p>shown in the research of Waters (1994) concerning Jamaican culture]. 
</p>
<p>People also exhibit certain attributes depending on the situation in which they are 
</p>
<p>located and the person(s) with whom they are interacting. Organizational settings may 
</p>
<p>also elicit certain traits and behaviors in people who behave differently elsewhere. In a 
</p>
<p>study based on the performance evaluations of managers, researchers attempted to assess </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>56 Cynthia Fuchs Epstein 
</p>
<p>whether person-related variables or situation-related variables were related to judgments 
about managers (Giannantonio, Olian, &amp; Carroll, 1995). The findings showed that al-
though subjects' ratings were affected by the manager's communication or leadership 
style, they were not affected by the manager's gender. 
</p>
<p>2.9. Inappropriate "Halo Effects" of Gender Practices 
</p>
<p>Noting differences (however measured) in one sphere is used to suggest comparable dif-
ferences in another, even though they may be irrelevant. Here the issue of causality is 
seriously questionable. The following illustrations point out the illogical and contradic-
tory nature of several widely held "common sense" and scholarly assertions about the 
cause of gender differences in some kinds of behavior. 
</p>
<p>Many women and men explain women's low representation in the ranks of manage-
ment as associated with their lack of experience in playing team sports. This comes from 
a romantic notion about the ennobling nature of team sports and an ideal of cooperation 
that is associated with them. Probably a more meaningful correlate is the fact that men in 
power tend to network with male friends they may have made while engaging in sports. 
In this example, the key variable is networking, not sports participation. Yet other schol-
ars claim that women practice connection and are not as individualistic as men, resulting 
in men becoming leaders because they are more individualistic (Chodorow, 1978; Gilligan, 
1982), an explanation that contradicts the supposed benefits of team sports. 
</p>
<p>Some explanations of the reason that clerical roles are overwhelmingly filled by 
women is that they are regarded as able to endure monotony because of the repetitious 
tasks they perform in the home and because of their docility. Yet their sewing ability is 
not regarded as useful in potential roles as surgeons, as it might well be if there were a 
more compelling logic to these associations. 
</p>
<p>3. TOWARD A MORE INFORMED MODEL OF GENDER 
</p>
<p>3.1. Gender Attributes as a Function of Social Roles 
</p>
<p>Position in the life course, and the social roles one assumes as a result, are probably the 
most important factors in determining the behavior of men and women, boys and girls, 
not their genes or early socialization. Most of the attributes affixed to a particular gender 
usually refer to attitudes and behaviors that are normatively prescribed and controlled in 
the context of the social roles people acquire (or have thrust upon them); they may be-
come internalized, but even if they are, they may be activated or deactivated for the moment, 
or forever. For example, Arlie Hochschild (1983) and other social scientists have pointed 
to the "emotion work" that women are compelled to do in certain occupational roles, such 
as showing nurturant behavior and friendliness in their jobs as flight attendants, nurses, 
and waitresses. Hochschild shows that women often need to be trained to exhibit caring 
behavior. These behaviors are also reinforced by supervisor and peer social control. 
</p>
<p>3.2. Social Control 
</p>
<p>An overview of research on gender distinctions indicates that there has been insufficient 
</p>
<p>attention to the impact of social controls on behavior in the models explaining observed </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Sociology of Gender Distinctions 57 
</p>
<p>sex differences. As I pointed out in Deceptive Distinctions (1988), when there are no 
controls enforcing sex-role behavior (or they are loosely applied), individuals fulfill their 
roles idiosyncratically, or in accordance with a variety of influences, such as their eco-
nomic interests or education. This reality leads to enormous variation within each sex or 
gender category. However, controls on behavior&mdash;punishments for deviation&mdash;may 
result in patterned behavior that is then regarded as "normal," which means that indi-
viduals are unaware of how superficial and variable many attributes associated with each 
</p>
<p>4. CONCLUSION 
</p>
<p>Gender boundaries are maintained by feminists and antifeminists, scholars and layper-
sons alike. None of us is free from them. It is no wonder that our scholarship is oriented 
toward finding them. The means of boundary maintenance may appear to be mechanical 
and physical, but they are always conceptual and symbolic. Boundaries are reinforced in 
the unnoticed habits and language of everyday life, vigilantly attended to by family and 
friends, business associates, and colleagues. Control in the way we think is exercised at 
the micro-level and at the level of the group or society, through symbolic behaviors such 
as rituals and ceremonies. There is a vast literature in psychology and sociology on the 
processes by which people are oriented toward classifying themselves and others accord-
ing to organizing principles such as gender, using such concepts as stereotyping sche-
mata (Deaux &amp; Major, 1987; Bem, 1981; Merton, [1957]) and, in current cultural socio-
logical focus, "habitus" as defined by Bourdieu (1984) and his associates in their work on 
cultural reproduction. Bourdieu indicates the ways in which dominated groups contribute 
to their own subordination because of habitus, for example, class-differentiated disposi-
tions and categories of perception shaped by conditions of existence. 
</p>
<p>Entrenched in the dominant symbolic system that contributed to its reproduction are 
binary oppositions. As I have pointed out previously (1970; 1988), dichotomous thinking 
plays an important part in the definition of women as "others," as deviants, and in their 
self-definitions. Although they were not the first to do so, Foucault (1977), Bourdieu 
(1979), and other European theorists of culture define power as the ability to impose a 
specific definition of reality that is disadvantageous to others. According to Chafetz (1988), 
the gender division of labor is the central support mechanism of gender stratification, and 
the means by which men acquire definitional power. It is this power, she asserts, that 
enables men to maintain the prevailing gender status quo. 
</p>
<p>Changing times create changes in people, although not all people are similarly adapt-
able to change. Over the past two decades many women have changed their destinies by 
going into work nontraditional for their sex; taking on leadership roles; and developing a 
level of confidence they never had before. Men, too, have changed, sharing a certain 
amount of childcare, forming more equalitarian marriages, and interacting with women 
coworkers more easily in their own work lives. 
</p>
<p>This demonstrates that men and women are adaptable, but their adaptability is not 
random. Members of some social groups or categories are permitted more diversity and 
change. The last few decades have provided the perfect "field experiment" to indicate 
how variable women and men can be. More dramatically today than at any time in his-
tory, American women (and unfortunately to a lesser extent, men) are recognized as 
publicly and personally complex creatures. The ambivalence that greets these changes </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>58 Cynthia Fuchs Epstein 
</p>
<p>also indicates the extent to which cultural and social controls determine the ability to 
change and to accept the notion of change in oneself. 
</p>
<p>Sociological studies of gender should more directly relate to this experience and we 
should derive our models from it, not from the armchair or the paradigmatic legacies of 
theorists who had a stake in the status quo. The more one goes into the field to do actual 
research on women's behavior, the more one finds that the concepts we call male and 
female&mdash;or gender&mdash;comprise multiple realities for the individual and for society. Re-
searcher should note that "male" and "female" are concepts, not things. What they are is 
always in question; they are not steady states. The theory and research methodology that 
label gender characteristics and define them according to custom without checking them 
against reality cheats women and men of their right to be evaluated as individuals, with 
an array of human characteristics.

</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>This chapter selectively reviews more than 25 years of research in anthropology to assess 
</p>
<p>the effects of premodern subsistence modes on variation in levels of sex inequality. Inas-
</p>
<p>much as hunger is the chief determinant of human relationships (Goody, 1982, p. 15; 
</p>
<p>Messer, 1984, p. 208), no society can be understood without knowing what men and 
</p>
<p>women must do each day in order to eat. I also focus on two societal functions that mesh 
</p>
<p>with a given subsistence technology in complex ways: reproduction and the legitimate 
</p>
<p>use of force. A large interdisciplinary literature on women in development is excluded 
</p>
<p>because it is reviewed elsewhere in this volume. 
</p>
<p>Most research on gender inequality has appeared since 1970, when anthropologists 
</p>
<p>first began to consider women's work. Earlier, Mead (1973, p. 4) could have been speak-
</p>
<p>ing for all social scientists when she said that women anthropologists wanted to do the 
</p>
<p>same work men did and therefore did not study the activities of women and children. 
</p>
<p>The mode of subsistence refers to the types of energy a society uses to secure food 
</p>
<p>(Friedl, 1975). Subsistence modes tend to respond to population pressure on a given 
</p>
<p>physical environment. The three major theorists of population dynamics&mdash;Smith, Marx, 
</p>
<p>and Boserup&mdash;agree that humans, like other animal populations, inherently tend to in-
</p>
<p>crease toward the environment's short-term carrying capacity (Hammel &amp; Howell, 1987; 
</p>
<p>North &amp; Thomas, 1973). Ensuing population pressure spurs technological innovation 
</p>
<p>and other adaptations for the management of scarce resources (Heider, 1972, p. 211). 
</p>
<p>Influenced by earlier work in anthropology and by Duncan's (1964) powerful analy-
</p>
<p>sis of ecology, Lenski (1970) classified societies by the major tool used in food production 
</p>
<p>to show how the interrelations of population, organization, ecology, and technology af-

<p>feet social stratification, thus making a wide range of data from anthropology accessible 
to sociologists (Moseley &amp; Wallerstein, 1978, p. 262). Earlier typologies that classified 
societies by the materials used to make tools (e.g., stone, iron) had been theoretically 
sterile, yielding no important predictions. A typology based on subsistence modes com-
bines comprehensiveness with minimal ambiguity and maximal reliability (Lenski, 1994, 
p. 24). 
</p>
<p>Appearing in rough sequence by order of technological complexity, subsistence modes 
affected societal size and organization by limiting the number of people who lived long 
enough to reproduce. I focus on those preindustrial modes whose technologies developed 
around field and forest resources: hunting and gathering, the hoe, herding, and the plow. 
I regret any distortions that may result from compressing so many societal types into one 
chapter. 
</p>
<p>Lenski's schema went far toward explaining the emergence of caste, class, feudal-
ism, and slavery, but said little about gender stratification. Anthropologist Ernestine Friedl 
(1975) was first to use a subsistence framework to explain why men tended to be more 
dominant than women in foraging and hoe cultures. Later, sociologists Rae Blumberg 
(1978,1995), Janet Chafetz (1984,1990), and several anthropologists (see Chafetz, 1984, 
p. 3) used a typology based on subsistence modes to explain societal variation in gender 
inequality. 
</p>
<p>The dependent variable, the level of sex inequality, is an asymmetrical concept. Like 
a pendulum destined to swing only to the midpoint of a trajectory, women collectively are 
never more advantaged than men. It is their extent of disadvantage that varies (Chafetz, 
1990, p. 117) and justifies attention to causal antedecents (Sen, 1990, p. 124). 
</p>
<p>Yet the causes of cross-cultural variation in gender disadvantage remain elusive. 
Sociology texts have nothing to say about the topic (Ferree &amp; Hall, 1996, p. 944). It was 
much studied in anthropology (under the rubric of women's status), yet reviews in the 
Annual Review of Anthropology (1977 and 1988, respectively) reported that the search 
for key causes had been unfruitful. What went wrong? 
</p>
<p>One possibility is that problems encountered in studies based on Murdock's (1967) 
cross-cultural sample (e.g., Whyte, 1978) dampened enthusiasm for macrolevel theories 
of women's status (Mason, 1984, p. 5; Mukhopadhyay &amp; Higgins, 1988, p. 462; Quinn, 
1977, p. 182).' Murdock's sampling was inadequate and the data, of uneven quality, had 
not been collected with the Murdock categories in mind (Fedigan, 1986, p. 47). Studies 
based on such data tend to yield inconclusive findings. 
</p>
<p>Another reason that causes of variation in sex inequality remain unclear is perhaps 
more significant. Despite their interest in political affairs, anthropologists gave little at-
tention to a persistent question that puzzled them: men's universal monopoly on politics. 
They also neglected a related issue, the most puzzling in the literature: women's exclu-
sion from institutionalized competition for prestige (Quinn, 1977, p. 222). Yet a decade 
later, despite the domination of gender issues in the study of small-scale societies in the 
1980s (Flanagan, 1989, p. 253), the reasons for women's lack of attainment in the politi-
cal or military arenas continued to receive little study (Mukhopadhyay &amp; Higgins, 1988, 
p. 464; Ross, 1986, p. 844). 
</p>
<p>A third reason may stem from anthropologists' attempts to avoid nineteenth century 
errors entailed by grand theorizing by their tendency to concentrate on particularities, 
leaving theoretical issues implicit and giving little attention to the methods that com-

</p>
<p>parative studies entail (Goody, 1962, p. v). Such practices make their findings hard to 
generalize. 
</p>
<p>Despite the problems of focusing on an area that is both underresearched and 
undertheorized, I proceed on the premise that the key to understanding premodern varia-
tion in sex inequality lies in the interrelations of subsistence production, the politico-
military arena where rules are made, and patterns of population maintenance. I examine 
how subsistence modes interact with two activities overwhelmingly the province of one 
sex: the legitimate use of force and the bearing and rearing of children. Men fight wars. 
Women bear and suckle children. Are these facts related? If so, how? 
</p>
<p>2. RECONSTRUCTING HUMAN EVOLUTION 
</p>
<p>I begin by reviewing research on human social evolution for its bearing on the relation-
ship of work, war, and population maintenance. The study of social evolution necessarily 
involves sociobiology, yet this area has become divisive in anthropology. Only a minority 
of cultural anthropologists accept the concepts of sociobiological theory, biological 
anthropology's basic perspective (Lieberman, 1989, p. 680). Like their counterparts in 
sociology,^ feminist anthropologists have been leery of claims that biology affects gender 
roles, perhaps because biology had long been invoked as the sole explanation. Gender 
theorists contest the degree to which ecology or evolution links sex differences to the 
division of labor when the real problem is to assess to what extent and in what ways the 
differences matter (Worthman, 1995, pp. 594, 602). 
</p>
<p>It is a mistake to overlook the role of biology in gender stratification, for at least one 
sex difference matters. The fact that no man can bear a child makes women central to 
population maintenance in a way that men cannot be, and population maintenance is 
crucial to species survival. It would be premature to exclude biological factors when the 
origins of sex stratification are so imperfectly understood. Human software derives from 
cultural evolution; the hardware is a result of biological evolution (Leach, 1984, p. 20). 
</p>
<p>Nineteenth century evolutionists held that all human societies progress through tech-
nological and social stages to a final civilized state, as in Europe. In the twentieth cen-
tury, their work was discredited for its ethnocentrism, teleology, methods, data, and con-
clusions in a reaction that led to the establishment of anthropology as a discipline (Orlove, 
</p>
<p>1980, p. 236). Classical anthropology then focused on topics such as kinship and symbol-
ism, neglecting the influence of economic factors (Testart, 1988, p. 9).' Food production 
was seen as a dull topic (Netting, 1974, p. 21). The study of social evolution lay dormant 
until the 1960s, when interest arose on the basis of data produced by twentieth century 
fieldwork (Fedigan, 1986, p. 32). 
</p>
<p>Two opposing theories currently explain how the human species evolved. The older 
one, man the hunter, is the most popular reconstruction of early social behavior (Zihlman, 
</p>
<p>1981, p. 75). It was drawn from a literature that converged on one distinguishing human 
trait: the pursuit, killing, and eating of animals with the use of tools. The most influential 
expression of the older theory, Washburn and Lancaster (1968) argued that hunting de-
</p>
<p>^ Rossi's (1977) thesis that biology plays a part in sex-role theory was very controversial (Miller &amp; Garrison, 1982, 
</p>
<p>p. 238), 
</p>
<p>' For example, Marshall's (1968, p. 13) analysis of marriage in the International Encyclopedia of the Social 
</p>
<p>Sciences defines brideprice, dowry, and polygyny without reference to women's economic contributions. </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>mands all those qualities of human behavior that separate man from other primates: male 
aggressiveness and pleasure in killing, bipedalism, elaborate toolkits, language, appre-
ciation of beauty, the division of labor, the monogamous nuclear family, loss of female 
estrus, and male bonding (Fedigan, 1986, p. 32). Washburn and Lancaster (1968) argued, 
further, that the killing of animals with tools had so long dominated human history that it 
shaped the human psyche for all time (Fedigan, 1986, p. 33). Their argument was re-
peated in so many articles and texts that it acquired something akin to the status of a 
received truth." Most of the authors in the two most influential compendiums of the time 
(Lee &amp; DeVore, 1968; Washburn, 1961) mentioned only hunting as a way to procure food 
(Fedigan, 1986, p. 33). 
</p>
<p>Like Darwin himself, man-the-hunter theorists failed to apply to human females the 
theory of sexual selection that Darwin developed to explain secondary sex differences: 
men were selected for intelligence, courage, and technological ability; women, for mater-
nal traits. This view pervades reconstructions based on the primacy of hunting (Fedigan, 
1986, p. 62). Tiger and Fox (1971) saw male bonding in hunting as focal; predatory 
aggression was genetically wired into (male) nature (Zihlman, 1981, p. 82). Wilson (1975), 
despite his emphasis on parental investment and mate choice as key concepts in sociobi-
ology, failed to apply them to female mammals or primates; nor did he use the concepts of 
maternal investment, female choice, and mechanisms of sexual selection to incorporate 
women into human evolution (Zihlman, 1981, p. 84). 
</p>
<p>Ironically, the article that championed the explanatory power of hunting (Lee &amp; 
Devore, 1968) provided insights and data that led to its undoing. The data showed gath-
ering as vital to foraging life. One of the editors, Lee (1968), even argued that hunters 
actually gather for a living. Lee's (1980) continuing analysis of women's contribution to 
subsistence was a major starting point in a reassessment of women's role in early human 
society (Fedigan, 1986, p. 34). Subsequent research exposed the male bias that pervaded 
the ethnographic studies on which the picture of man the hunter was based (Dahlberg, 
1981, p. 2).

<p>A newer view of evolution centers on woman the gatherer. Man the hunter came to 
be seen as a backward projection of sex stereotypes onto humans of more than a inillion 
years ago (Zihlman, 1981, p. 76), Themes of male aggression, dominance, and hunting 
that led to the belief that sex inequality was rooted in biological sex differences were 
modified to fit a growing body of data on living apes and hunter-gatherers. It is improb-
able that hominid mothers sat about awaiting the return of the hunters; more likely, they 
actively sought food while carrying infants. To postulate that early human females were 
sedentary denies their primate heritage (Zihlman, 1981, p. 89). There were no sedentary 
females in foraging societies. Available quantitative data show that women were away 
from camp as long as men and walk the same distances, carrying infants and heavier 
burdens (Fedigan, 1986, p. 49). Recent data even suggest that our hominid ancestors had 
no home bases (Potts, 1984), making untenable a house-bound vision of early women 
(Fedigan, 1986, p. 60). 
</p>
<p>Moreover, according to sociobiological theory, heavy maternal investment in off-
spring implies that it was females rather than males who chose mates. Burdened by de-
pendent offspring, females must have chosen sociable males willing to share food and 
</p>
<p>"&bull; Lovejoy's (1981) theory, the best known, sees the central adaptation in human evolution as male provisioning of 
</p>
<p>sedentary, fecund, monogamous females (Fedigan, 1986, p. 62). </p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>protect them and their babies, turning around the older picture in which dominant males 
pick females who, in turn, try to remain attractive enough to secure a mate, food, protec-
tion, and offspring (Zihlman, 1981, p. 88). 
</p>
<p>Sociobiology clearly cuts more than one way with regard to theories of sex inequal-
ity. If early women were not "house-bound," waiting for their men to supply food for them 
and their children, how could the domestic responsibilities of women derive from nature? 
Although its accuracy has never been debated, the assumption that it is natural for women 
to be found at the hearth still undergirds most theories of human social evolution. Per-
haps, as Fedigan (1986, p. 38) suggests, the only division of labor in which sex matters is 
the one that involves insemination, gestation, and lactation. 
</p>
<p>In the following paragraph, I discuss human adaptations based on hunting and gath-
ering, the hoe, herding, and the plow. The analysis is based on two principles of stratifi-
cation. First, a necessary condition for gender equality is that women must be economi-
cally interdependent with other producers rather than dependent on male producers 
(Fedigan, 1986, p. 43; Leacock, 1981). The second, Friedl's (1975) modification of the 
first, suggests a sufficient condition: women must not only contribute to subsistence but 
also exercise control over the distribution of valved goods in order to equal men in power 
and prestige. In sum, producers have more power and prestige than consumers and in any 
society those who control the distribution of valued goods beyond the family have the 
most power and prestige. 
</p>
<p>3. HUNTING AND GATHERING SOCIETIES 
</p>
<p>Hunting and gathering comprise a way of life that resembles the technological adapation 
of all Homo sapiens before the domestication of plants and animals about 10,000 years 
ago (Friedl, 1975, p. 12). Forager groups are small (about 50 persons), mobile, and 
nonterritorial, which constrains the accrual of a surplus and leads to an egalitarian em-
phasis on sharing resources (Lee &amp; DeVore, 1968). The few peoples for whom foraging 
remains a major source of food today occupy land no one else wants (yet): African and 
South American rain forest, Arctic tundra, and Australian desert (Spielman &amp; Eder, 
1994, p. 311). 
</p>
<p>Foragers use several methods to obtain most of their food: gathering wild plants and 
small animals such as mice or clams; hunting large animals such as deer, caribou, whales, 
or seal; and fishing. Meat is always a favored food (Friedl, 1975, p. 12). Correlated with 
latitude, the amount in the diet ranges from 10% near the equator to 90% in the Arctic 
(Testart, 1978, cited in Fedigan, 1986, p. 48). 
</p>
<p>By consensus, foraging societies exhibit the least social inequality. Whether they are 
truly or only relatively so has been debated (Flanagan, 1989, p. 254). Feminist scholars 
tried to document the absence of sex inequality to prove that inequality did not derive 
from nature (Collier &amp; Yanigasako, 1987); Marxists hoped to show that in the absence of 
private property, equality prevails (Leacock, 1981; Sacks, 1982). However, most anthro-
pologists see social inequality as universal; all known societies use criteria of sex, age, 
and personal attributes in allocating power (Sahlins, 1958, p. 1). 
</p>
<p>Hunter-gatherer subsistence ensures a low level of inequality because foragers, who 
move when the food supply in a given area is depleted, own only what they can carry. 
They highly value sharing, which reduces the risks of living in groups that cannot readily </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>70 Joan Huber 
</p>
<p>buffer a variable environment (Cashden, 1980, p. 117). All foraging societies have rules 
that order the sharing of meat; the ones that survived were those that found ways to 
encourage the fulfillment of exchange obligations (Friedl, 1975, p. 20). 
</p>
<p>On average, women's contribution to foragers' food supply more or less equals men's, 
which leads to women's being seen as self-sufficient rather than to higher status (Schlegel 
&amp; Barry, 1986; Sanday, 1973). Gathering produces only enough food for a woman and 
her family. Hunters earn esteem as generous hosts because hunting enables men to dis-
tribute a highly valued food to the entire band (Friedl, 1975). 
</p>
<p>Both men and women can master the needed skills, so why did women never hunt?^ 
Friedl (1975, p. 16) suggests that the answer lies in a complex of interdependent condi-
tions related to childbearing. To offset the effects of high death rates, women foragers are 
often pregnant or lactating. They are barred from hunting in the later stages of pregnancy 
by shifts in body balance; after the birth, by the burden of the child, which must remain 
with its mother while it is breastfed. Although food supplements are added at 1 to 6 
months in all preindustrial cultures (Raphael &amp; Davis, 1985, p. 141), lactation occupies 
3 to 4 years because shorter periods tend to increase infant mortality (Cronk, 1991, p. 28). 
Hunting also requires distance running, which may affect ability to ovulate (Graham, 
1985). 
</p>
<p>Although anthropologists traditionally have explained marriage as a male-female 
bond occasioned by the food needs of a female with dependents (Ember &amp; Ember, 1983, 
p. 41), it is perhaps better seen as a way to recruit labor, distribute food, and provide for 
procreation and sexual pleasure (Friedl, 1975, p. 23). Among foragers, monogamy was 
the most common form. On average, a hunter typically lacked enough meat at any one 
time to care for more than one set of marital, paternal, and affinal obligations (Friedl, 
1975, p. 26). 
</p>
<p>War is rare among foragers. Population is sparse and land is plentiful. Conflicts 
within bands are often settled by the departure of one party in a dispute, and women are 
often involved in the decision (Friedl. 1975, p. 15). Leadership roles are limited to the 
persuasive influence of skilled hunters, to women skillful enough to attract their married 
offspring to live with them as adults, and to men and women with shamanistic skills. No 
leader can coerce others (Friedl, 1975, p. 31). Male dominance is greatest when hunting 
is the sole source of food; equality is greatest where men and women together perform the 
major subsistence tasks. 
</p>
<p>4. HORTICULTURAL SOCIETIES 
</p>
<p>Horticulture, plant cultivation with digging stick or hoe in garden-size plots, began in 
Asia Minor about 10,000 years ago. It marked the beginnings of modern stratification. 
Boserup (1965), reversing Malthus, suggests that population pressure, driven by the need 
to feed more individuals, causes rather than follows intensification of cultivation. In the 
simple form the major subsistence tool is a digging stick. People had to move every few 
years to replace plots whose fertility was lost. 
</p>
<p>The advanced form of horticulture appeared about 6000 years ago with the invention 
of metallurgy. The hoe replaced the digging stick while metal weapons replaced sticks 
and stones. Because humans can be hurt more easily with metal weapons than with sticks 
</p>
<p>* Well, hardly ever. In Northern Luzon, Agta women always took part in hunting (Estioko-Griffin, 1985). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Comparative Gender Stratiflcation 71 
</p>
<p>and stones, war for the first time became a profitable way to acquire food produced by 
someone else (Lenski, 1970). The effect on gender stratification was profound because 
everywhere war is men's work, associated with the devaluation of women (Hayden, 1995, 
p. 63). 
</p>
<p>The use of metal weapons to secure food requires a third principle of gender stratifi-
cation that concerns the use of force: The more often a society engages in warfare, the 
more likely is social control to be vested in politico-military elites that exclude women 
(see Collins, 1988, p. 168-173). 
</p>
<p>Hoe societies, which exemplify the gender role diversity that provided the founda-
tion for the relativist view of human beliefs and behaviors made popular by Boas and his 
students, vary in patterns of domestic exchange, postmarital residence, and household 
composition. The crucial variable is the control of economic resources, especially labor. 
The question is, which sex can command the labor of others and control the distribution 
of the resulting accumulation (Friedl, 1975, p. 61)? 
</p>
<p>The gender division of labor takes three forms. Men can prepare land for cultivation 
(felling trees, cutting and burning underbrush) while both sexes cultivate it, a pattern 
common to sub-Saharan Africa. Men can clear land and women cultivate it, a pattern 
among Indians of the eastern United States. Men can both clear and cultivate, a rare 
pattern found in inland tropical south America (Friedl, 1975, p. 51). 
</p>
<p>Once the land is cleared, there is no adaptive advantage in having either men or 
women plant, weed, harvest, and transport crops. Lactating women can carry babies and 
return with loads of food as women gatherers do. The time and energy women spend on 
childcare are allocated under the constraints posed by their work, not the other way round. 
For example, early supplementary feeding of infants is more likely if women do much 
subsistence work (Nerlove, 1974). Norms concerning family size and systems of childcare 
typically conform to women's customary work requirements (Blumberg, 1978: Chafetz, 
1984; Friedl, 1975; Mukhopadhyay &amp; Higgins, 1988, p. 475; Quinn, 1977, p. 193). Ac-
cording to cross-cultural time allocation studies, women simply add childcare to their 
other tasks (Zihlman, 1997, p. 194). 
</p>
<p>In simple hoe societies the sexual division of labor consists of the male monopoly 
over the initial clearing of new land (Friedl, 1975, pp. 53-60). Once or twice a generation 
the land to be cleared lies next to land worked by other peoples, leading to warfare. A 
potential need for defense in the acquisition of new territory probably contributed to mak-
ing the slash-and-burn process largely men's work, although land-clearing probably fails 
to confer the advantages that the monopoly on hunting gives forager men. 
</p>
<p>In both simple and advanced hoe societies, marriage and kinship customs tend to 
follow the division of labor (Friedl, 1975). Unilateral reckoning of descent is most com-
mon in hoe societies, perhaps because women sometimes produce more food than do 
men. Patrilineality tends to occur when both spouses cultivate. Matrilineality is found in 
about a quarter of hoe societies, usually when only women cultivate. Matrilineal inherit-
ance tends to occur when women produce more than do men (Goody, 1976). 
</p>
<p>Patrilocality (postmarital residence with husband's kin) tends to occur when the 
male contribution to subsistence is high. It disadvantages the wife although she can com-
pensate by bearing sons whose wives she can later dominate. Wives also can become the 
worms within the apple of a patrilocal domestic group (Collier, 1974, p. 92). Working 
together separated from kin tends to integrate them as a group and gives them a measure 
of power (Leis, 1974). Matrilocality typically occurs where female contribution to subsis-
tence is high. The infrequency with which patterns of residence leave related women </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>72 Joan Huber 
</p>
<p>together and disperse related men, rather than vice versa, helps to explain why the degree 
of political influence exercised by Iroquois women is found in few societies (Quinn, 1977, 
p. 214). 
</p>
<p>The divorce rate should increase as women's share of subsistence tasks rises because 
couples can more easily part when it affects the food supply of neither of the spouses nor 
their children. Although data are sketchy, this expectation is upheld: divorce rates among 
hoe peoples appear high compared to U.S. rates (Friedl, 1975, p. 93). 
</p>
<p>Because warfare is common and women's subsistence contribution is also high, po-
lygyny occurs more often in advanced hoe societies than in all other types. Warfare en-
hances male political control because men's service as warriors strengthens their control 
on rights of citizenship (Grant, 1991, p. 14). War also alters the sex ratio (Ember, 1974).' 
Under such conditions, polygyny is a way to raise productivity, as economist Ester Boserup 
(1970) first noted (Lesthaeghe &amp; Surkyn, 1988) and it is widely practiced in a populist 
form (Huber &amp; Spitze, 1988, p. 488). Nearly everyone marries but women marry early, 
men late, and a high death rate helps to even the sex ratio. Male incentives to practice 
polygyny lie not in the desire to collect women but in the need for children's labor (Ember 
&amp; Ember, 1983, p. 13). Women's incentives likewise derive from their need for children's 
labor, especially for support in old age. 
</p>
<p>Warfare affects sex stratification more generally through its close ties with gover-
nance (Goldschmidt, 1959, p. 166). The requirements of waging war encourage the es-
tablishment of autocratic and hierarchical political organizations and the formation of 
politico-military elites in which women play no part. Among ordinary men, the presence 
of an outside enemy, real or imagined, stimulates solidarity and promotes the exclusion of 
women from political life (Rose, 1986, p. 852). In turn, exclusion from political life leads 
to lack of control over property. Goheen (1996, p. 137), for example, recounts how 
Cameroon men's earlier status as hunters and warriors led to the need for women to seek 
men's permission to cultivate, giving rise to the saying that men own the fields, women 
own the crops. By contrast, in a rare instance of women's full participation in warfare 
(among the Fon in Dahomey), women's political activity was also high and they could 
control property (Ross, 1986, p. 852; see also Colhns, 1985, p. 390). 
</p>
<p>Why do women so rarely take part in organized violence? The male monopoly is 
often attributed to their relative strength and size within (but not across) populations and 
to greater aggressiveness, but such explanations pose problems. Larger, stronger males 
do not generally dominate shorter, weaker ones (Chafetz, 1984, p. 118); adult dominance 
derives from diverse social talents (flattery, deception, competence, nurturance). Inter-
personal aggression may be detrimental to effective leadership (Maccoby &amp; Jacklin, 1974, 
p. 274).' 
</p>
<p>More than 20 years ago Friedl (1975, p. 57) suggested that the male monopoly on 
warfare resulted from men's relative expendability in population maintenance, but schol-
ars gave this proposal little attention either before or during the decade 1977-1987 
(Mukhopadhyay &amp; Higgins, 1988, p. 470) nor have I located research on this topic con-
ducted after 1987. However, Friedl's conjecture makes sense. In the preindustrial repro-
ductive cycle the most frequent states are pregnancy and lactation (Harrell, 1981). How-
</p>
<p>' Harris (1981) sees female infanticide as the cause of frequent warfare over women but Ember and Ember (1994, 
</p>
<p>p. 186) note that HRAF data fail to support his claim that this practice actually makes women scarce. 
</p>
<p>' Whether men's greater verbal aggressiveness is Western or pancultural has not been studied (Quinn, 1977, p. 
</p>
<p>190). </p>
<p/>

<p>Comparative Gender Stratification 73 
</p>
<p>ever, pregnancy reduces combat effectiveness; depriving a suckling of nourishment re-
duces its chances of survival. The real costs of sending pregnant and lactating women off 
to war are obvious. 
</p>
<p>5. HERDING SOCIETIES 
</p>
<p>Herding and hoe societies appeared in the same time period; animals were domesticated 
at about the same time as plants. Pastoral economies cover the technological range of hoe 
and simple plow societies in areas where tillage is hard owing to mountainous terrain, 
short growing season, or low rainfall as in central Asia, Arabia, North Africa, parts of 
Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa (Lenski &amp; Lenski, 1978, p. 235). Small-scale use of hoe 
or plow may occur. As explained in the section on plow societies, the herders' level of 
living often exceeds that of peasants (Krader, 1968, p. 458). Moreover, owing to histori-
cal accident, herding societies uniquely influenced the modern world when the gender 
norms of ancient Hebrew herders became embedded in law and custom across much of 
Eurasia and North Africa owing to the political and military victories of Christian and 
Muslim conquerors. 
</p>
<p>Ecology matters. Moving livestock to seasonal pastures to convert grass into human 
food usually requires a nomadic or seminomadic way of life. In turn, the use of spatial 
mobility as a survival strategy leads to competition with agrarians over territory and 
disputes over water and stolen animals (Beck. 1978, p. 352). Constant threat of conflict 
during migration stimulates growth and consolidation of political authority. Men of cour-
age are prized as warfare becomes culturally attractive (Barfield, 1994, p. 161). 
</p>
<p>Because the open grasslands where most herders live pose few barriers to movement 
and political consolidation, herding societies may be huge (e.g., the empire of Ghenghis 
Khan) but their communities are only a little larger than foragers' because effective main-
tenance of herds is best done in small units and the food supply is limited (Beck, 1978, p. 
352). In the ninth century BCE, Asian herders learned to ride their horses, which gave 
them great advantage over less mobile agrarians in ensuing waves of conquest. Herding 
groups repeatedly devastated Eurasian agrarian empires over a period of more than 2500 
years (Lenski &amp; Lenski, 1978, pp. 237-318.) 
</p>
<p>Generalizing about sex inequality in herding societies is risky because many of them 
also depend on hoe or plow (which oppositely affect women's economic productivity) and 
also for lack of data. A careful study of how men and women in any nomadic pastoral 
society influence decisions on resource allocation has yet to be made. The study of no-
mads was undoubtedly spurred by romantic stereotypes of fierce and independent peoples 
but all virtues were defined as male and the role of women was grossly neglected until 
after 1970 (Dyson-Hudson &amp; Dyson-Hudson, 1980, p. 15fO. 
</p>
<p>The value placed on a politico-military elite should result in a fairly high level of 
inequality among men and between men and women. Herding societies are most likely to 
require patrilocal residence and have hereditary slavery (Lenski &amp; Lenski, 1978, p. 237). 
Women are excluded from the most important subsistence tasks, a result, according to 
Evans-Pritchard (1965, p. 50), of their lack of experience in warfare and the diplomacy 
needed to settle disputes at water holes, their lesser physical strength, and herders' need 
to be away from home for long periods (Elam, 1973, p. 46). 
</p>
<p>The practice of polygyny in herding regimes depends on the extent to which ecologi-
cal conditions permit only herding or also permit use of hoe or plow. Polygyny is rare </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>74 Joan Huber 
</p>
<p>when the environment (as in central Asia) neither offers men much chance to become 
rich nor women to become economically active but it may increase when an encounter 
with a market society gives women an opening such as carpet-making (Barfield, 1981, p. 
79). If use of the hoe gives women economic opportunities, as often happens in East 
Africa, polygyny may be fairly common (Hakansson, 1988), appearing in the populist 
form common to advanced hoe societies. If the plow is used in conjunction with herding, 
as in North Africa, some men may become rich enough to marry more than one wife. 
Women then may be barred from property inheritance, although Islamic law forbids it. 
For example, Libyan Bedouins know it is against religious law to exclude women from 
inheritance but they also know that the uncontrolled alienation of property would destroy 
the basis of corporate life (Peters, 1978, p. 324). 
</p>
<p>6. AGRARIAN SOCIETIES 
</p>
<p>Simple agrarian societies appeared in the Middle East about 3000 BCE with the intro-
duction of a wooden plow, probably as a result of population pressure. Techniques to 
smelt iron, invented about 2000 years later, provided an iron blade and marked the ad-
vent of advanced agrarian societies. Warfare became more widespread. Unlike tin and 
copper, iron is a common metal, which thus permits a great proliferation of weaponry. 
</p>
<p>Use of the plow spread from the Middle East until agrarian societies covered most of 
Asia, Europe, and North Africa.* Boserup's key insight was that people do not turn the 
earth, fodder animals, and collect manure unless they must (Netting, 1993, p. 103). With 
low population density and shifting tillage, women do most of the work with handheld 
tools; polygyny was a way to increase production. With high population density and settled 
agriculture, men do most of the work; women become economic liabilities, in need of a 
dowry as a basis for their support (Boserup, 1970, p. 35). 
</p>
<p>The most obvious effect of the plow was a vast increase in the food supply. Use of the 
plow made continuous cultivation possible for the first time by reducing weeds and turn-
ing soil deeply enough to restore fertility. It stimulated the domestication of draft ani-
mals. Confining them in stalls to prevent their wandering away encouraged the collection 
of manure to fertilize the fields. The invention of writing soon followed (the better to 
keep track of a surplus large enough to be stored) as did the beginnings of empire build-
ing (Lenski &amp; Lenski, 1978, p. 177). 
</p>
<p>Eurasian stratification patterns assumed the pyramidal form common to feudalism: 
a political and economic elite; a sprinkling of merchants, artisans, and craft workers of 
lesser rank; and swarms of peasants, serfs, and slaves. The plow had a devastating effect 
on the lives of ordinary people. A food surplus in the countryside coupled with the avail-
ability of iron weapons tempted elites to extract as much as possible from impoverished 
peasants. The flatter and richer the land, the worse off were ordinary people, probably 
much worse off than were their forager ancestors (Lenski &amp; Lenski, 1978, p. 206). In 
addition, oral health and skeletal robustness declined as a result of consumption of too 
many carbohydrates and reduced physical activity (Larsen, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Yet the plow depressed women's status more than men's. First, because men mo-
nopolized it, women's share of food production plummeted. With oxen, a man could plow 
</p>
<p>' The plow was rarely used in sub-Saharan Africa until the 1900s. Oxen, the best draft animals, do not thrive in 
</p>
<p>Central Africa's humid tse-tse zones or in West African coastal zones (Shipton, 1994, p. 357). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Comparative Gender Stratiflcation 75 
</p>
<p>in a day an area far larger than a woman could till by hoe (Childe, 1951, p. 100). The 
plow required the management of heavy draft animals in larger fields further from home, 
making it hard to arrange a schedule to suit a nursing baby (Blumberg, 1978, p. 50). The 
less food women produce, the more they are valued only as mothers (Goody, 1976, p. 34). 
</p>
<p>Second, plow technology makes land the chief form of wealth because a field can be 
tilled in perpetuity. Coupled with the huge increase in productivity and the specialization 
that this permits, land becomes a scarce good (Goody, 1976, p. 97). Individual land own-
ership gives rise to laws and customs that reflect elite men's monopoly on warfare and 
related political and economic institutions. Women can inherit land (see later) but typi-
cally exert little control over it (Agarwal, 1994). 
</p>
<p>The reason that land ownership so changes law and custom is that land is an impar-
tible inheritance (unlike cattle, for example). A given piece under given technology sup-
ports only a given number of persons. Rule and custom come to ensure inheritance pat-
terns that prevent land from being overly subdivided. The scarcer it becomes and the 
more intensively it is used, the greater the tendency to retain it in the nuclear family, the 
basic unit of production and reproduction (Goody, 1976, p. 97). Monogamy prevails lest 
land be dispersed among too many legal heirs, and divorce becomes difficult or impos-
sible. The concern with women's sexual purity stems from their status as transmitters of 
male property. The larger her endowment, the more her behavior is controlled (Goody, 
1976, p. 14). Infibulation and footbinding, for example, began as ways to ensure imperial 
men's exclusive access to consorts. Both practices elicited a competitive upward flow of 
women and downward flow of self-enforcing customs that were maintained by interde-
pendent needs on the marriage market. Women needed resources and men needed certain 
knowledge of paternity (Mackie, 1996).' 
</p>
<p>If land is so valuable, why are women permitted to inherit it? Why does bilateral 
inheritance prevail in agrarian societies? The answer is that the greater volume of pro-
duction that the plow affords can support an elaborate division of labor and a variety of 
lifestyle. If an elite male is to maintain his own and his children's style of life, he must 
marry a similarly endowed spouse, which is an incentive to establish a bilateral inherit-
ance system (Goody, 1976). The political institutions that permitted elite males to control 
their wives' property later expand to include a broader segment of the male population. 
</p>
<p>Different strategies of heirship in sub-Saharan hoe societies and Eurasian plow soci-
eties stem from the respective value of land (Goody, 1976, p. 97). In Africa, economic 
differences among families are minor, land is plentiful, and there less pressure to provide 
an heir to an estate (Goody &amp; Tambiah, 1973, p. 22). A daughter's marriage little affects 
her economic position because women, married or not, grow crops or do craft work. A 
daughter needs no endowment to maintain her status. In Eurasia, a man provides for his 
sons at his death and for his daughters by dowry at marriage lest family status decline in 
the social hierarchy. 
</p>
<p>Thus, women's economic contribution to subsistence declines with the introduction 
of the plow while powerful elites come to control a vastly increased surplus. Both women 
and men may inherit property but men control that of their wives. Women's sexual behav-
ior is constrained to ensure that only her husband's children inherit his property. In ef-
fect, use of the plow puts women under guardianship of husbands or male relatives. 
</p>
<p>' With such powerful incentives as the need to ensure one's subsistence, people come to accept customs that other-

<p>clitoridectomy came to play a part in Kenyan women's authority structure (Robertson, 1996), and the high-heeled

<p>7. THE MODERN WORLD 
</p>
<p>Urbanization began relatively late in northern Europe. In technology, Europe was then 
nearly a millennium behind China, which was probably the main reason why a revolu-
tionary industrial technology could be introduced in so short a time (Boserup. 1981, p. 
101),'&deg; altering patterns of population maintenance, subsistence work, and warfare. In-
fant mortality and fertility decline; by 1910 safe methods of artificial feeding end ababy's 
dependence on a lactating woman for survival (Huber, 1990). Education becomes univer-
sal, for the modern labor market requires workers whose qualifications are independent 
of ascribed characteristics (Jackson, 1984; Marwell, 1975). Warfare requires more brains, 
less brawn. These events spawn social movements that spur the changes in gendered 
behavior, belief, law, and custom (Chafetz &amp; Dworkin, 1986) that comprise the theme of 
this handbook. 
</p>
<p>8. CONCLUSION 
</p>
<p>To assess the effects of subsistence technology on sex inequality, I analyze its interrela-
tionships with patterns of population maintenance and politico-military institutions in 
premodern societies. Three principles of stratification guide the chapter: producers have 
more power than consumers, those who control the distribution of valued goods beyond 
the family have the most power, and the more often a society makes war, the more likely 
is social control to be vested in politico-military elites that include no women. The sub-
sistence modes examined are those of foraging, hoe, herding, and plow. The basic ques-
tion concerns the relationship of women's monopoly on childbearing to men's monopoly 
on politico-military affairs. Can women's absence from the arena where rules are made 
be a result of female centrality in population maintenance? 
</p>
<p>Both in hunting and gathering and simple hoe cultures, women contribute heavily to 
subsistence. War is rare, for weapons are inefficient, people are few, land is plentiful. The 
level of social and gender inequality is low. 
</p>
<p>Women's economic contribution is also high in advanced hoe cultures but warfare 
becomes common when the invention of metallargy improves weaponry, spurring the 
formation of politico-military elites that include no women because, to offset high death 
rates, they are so often pregnant or lactating in prime years. It is the invention of metal-
lurgy that makes warriors and political leaders only of men. 
</p>
<p>Herding limits women's productivity while conflict over water rights and animal 
theft makes warfare central. Controls on women's behavior tend to moderate if the hoe is 
also used because women then contribute to subsistence. If the plow is the auxiliary sub-
sistence tool, male elites can acquire many wives, secluding them at little cost for they 
contribute little to subsistence. 
</p>
<p>With the plow, women's economic contribution declines sharply from earlier levels 
while increased productivity and more effective weapons provide incentives for warfare. 
By making land the chief form of wealth, the plow spurs the emergence of laws and 
customs that benefit male elites and disadvantage women even more than ordinary men. 
</p>
<p>" Goody (1996b), unlike Marx and Weber, holds that dominant groups were similarly organized across Eurasia 
</p>
<p>because they faced similar problems in managing resources. The uniqueness of the West requires no explanation. 
</p>
<p>There is nothing to explain. </p>
<p/>

<p>Comparative Gender Stratification 77 
</p>
<p>This chapter thus suggests (but falls short of proving) that it is the institutionalizing 
of warfare in advanced hoe cultures that first brings about women's absence from huts or 
halls of power. After the plow makes land the chief form of wealth, the institution of 
private property intensifies the effects of men's monopoly on warfare. Even with an ide-
ology of sex equality, the Soviet Union's abolition of private property could not overcome 
the effects of militarism. 
</p>
<p>Population maintenance no longer requires serial pregnancy and lactation. Work 
and warfare require extensive training. Unsurprisingly, women's military participation is 
rising. The big increase in the number of women in U.S. services came in the 1970s when 
the draft ended and a volunteer force was created (Holm, 1992, pp. 246-259). The con-
tentious issue today, first made salient by the industrial revolution, is women's service in 
combat (Goldman, 1982, p. 4). After the 1970s, a majority came to approve some combat 
roles for women (Peach, 1996, p. 186). Given the potential of biological, chemical, and 
nuclear warfare, barring women from combat hardly ensures their survival (Segal, 1982, 
p. 281). Excluding woman from combat simply limits their promotion opportunities and 
access to job training, education, retirement benefits, medical care, low-cost insurance, 
bonuses, loans, and state and federal employment preferences (Peach, 1996, p. 175). 
</p>
<p>The idea that sex inequality results from the interaction of work, war, and childbear-
ing is based on a survey of a literature that would repay further study despite its lack of 
attention to women as political actors (Ross, 1986, p. 54). Such studies of relatively iso-
lated premodern societies conducted earlier need to be integrated with the current work of 
anthropologists, economists, and sociologists on regions that harbor a mix of premodern 
subsistence and modern industrial technologies. How do the interrelations of work, war, 
and childbearing change when an isolated premodern society is pulled into the vortex of 
the world political economy? How do the findings speak to theories of sex inequality? Let 
the work begin.

<p>Third World Women 
</p>
<p>and Global Restructuring 
</p>
<p>JEAN L. PYLE 
</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>This chapter surveys the status of women in Third World nations and the impact that 
global economic restructuring has had on their lives. It shows that there are systemic 
links among the forms of economic restructuring, increases in informal sector employ-
ment, rising poverty, and the continued disadvantaged economic status of women relative 
to men. It argues that these linkages result from characteristics of the global market 
system as a whole and the traditional theoretical approach (neoclassical economics) upon 
which the market system and much of the global restructuring is based. Understanding 
the overall effects and the relationships among these phenomena is critical for develop-
ing policies to enhance the well-being of women. 
</p>
<p>2. WOMEN'S STATUS IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES 
</p>
<p>Although women have experienced improvements in some dimensions of their lives (such 
</p>
<p>as in labor force participation levels and access to education in some countries), they are 
</p>
<p>at distinct economic disadvantage relative to men in almost all regards. Several publica-

<p>tions in the last few years provide a great range of data by region of the world and by 
categories of information (Seager, 1997; UN 1995b; UNDP, 1995); however, in this chap-
ter I can only briefly allude to the highlights of this wealth of information. 
</p>
<p>A disproportionate number of the poor are women. United Nations (UN) agencies 
estimate that 70% of the 1.3 billion poor are women (UNDP, 1995) and more than one 
half a billion women in rural areas, 60% of the world's rural population, live below the 
poverty line (UN, 1995a). It links this to unequal treatment in the labor market, their 
position in the family, and their treatment by the government (UNDP, 1995). Higher rates 
of poverty, together with the fact that women spend more hours a week working than men 
in almost all areas of the world, when household duties are included, reduce their quality 
of life (UN, 1991b, 1995b; UNDP, 1995). Much of women's work, particularly that in the 
home, has been undercounted and undervalued. It is estimated to be worth $11 trillion 
(UNDP, 1995). 
</p>
<p>From 1970 to 1990 the female share of the labor force increased in most regions 
except sub-Sahara Africa (UN, 1995b). However, there is considerable variation in fe-
male labor force participation among regions, ranging from 21% in North Africa to 43% 
in the Caribbean (UN, 1995b). Although women's share of the labor force has been in-
creasing, it is widely documented that occupational segregation and discrimination "per-
sist almost everywhere," a large earnings gap exists between men and women, and women 
"have less access to training and capital" (UN, 1991b, p. 81). Women have higher rates of 
unemployment in most areas of the world (UNDP, 1995). They are constrained in obtaining 
ownership of property in sizable areas of the world (Seager, 1997). Further, because they 
therefore have little collateral, it is generally very hard for women to obtain credit. Wide-
spread labor market and societal discrimination against women have caused much of this. 
</p>
<p>According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) (1995), in many regions 
of the world, the informal sector labor force is growing faster than the labor force as a 
whole. Such employment has become the only option for many people because of stagna-
tion or cutbacks in formal sector employment, high rates of unemployment, and the fall-
ing incomes and higher prices resulting from many structural adjustment programs. In-
creases are often correlated with economic crisis, but, as I will show later, as part of the 
trend toward more "flexible" production that gives firms more leeway to lay off workers, 
informal networks of production tend to grow. 
</p>
<p>The informal sector spans a wide range of small scale economic activities in agricul-
ture, industry, and services and generally involves simple technologies, small amounts of 
capital, few employees if any, and little to no regulation or record keeping. In comparison 
to formal sector activities, informal sector activities bring lower pay, no benefits, poorer 
working conditions, no job security, higher prices for borrowing money and buying mate-
rials, and limited access to markets. 
</p>
<p>Women, in particular, must resort to income-generating activities in the informal 
sector because of economic crisis, limited access to formal sector jobs in many areas, or 
because informal sector jobs are easier to combine with child-care and home responsibili-
ties. For example, as women's employment in formal sector or wage work decreased in 
the 1970s and 1980s in Latin America and the Caribbean, and remained very low in 
Africa, many women were forced to seek opportunities in the informal sector. 
</p>
<p>There was no recommended definition of the informal sector until 1993 (UN 1995b), 
and because of the widespread nature of the activities it encompasses and problems with 
data collection, data on women's participation are at best general estimates. Women's 
participation varies greatly between and within regions, and according to sector. To pro-</p>

</p>
<p>vide an example, the percentage of women in the informal sector (as approximated by 
self-employment) ranged from 25% in Latin America and the Caribbean to almost 60% 
in sub-Sahara Africa in 1985 (UN, 1991b). 
</p>
<p>In light of their disadvantaged status, women have been active in organizing, often 
through nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), to improve all dimensions of their lives. 
In addition, four major UN conferences on women have been held, in 1975, 1980, 1985, 
and 1995. The UN conferences assess women's progress, or lack of it, and formulate 
strategies to improve their status. Unfortunately, these conferences do not have the power 
to implement their plans but must rely on people working within their home countries to 
promote the goals adopted at the conferences. For example. The Nairobi Strategies, de-
veloped at the Third UN World Conference on Women in 1985, demand that govern-
ments: play key roles in ensuring that both men and women enjoy equal rights in such 
areas as education, training, and employment; act to remove negative stereotypes and 
perceptions of women; disseminate information to women about their rights and entitle-
ments; collect timely and accurate statistics on women and monitor their situation; and 
encourage the sharing and support of domestic responsibilities (UN, 1991b). Two of the 
ten objectives for Beijing, 1995, were to address the "inequality in women's access to and 
participation in the definition of economic structures and policies and the productive 
process itself and "the persistent and growing burden of poverty on women." 
</p>
<p>3. GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING 
</p>
<p>Global economic restructuring includes a number of different types of changes in the 
</p>
<p>world economy. It may refer to any of the following: 
</p>
<p>&bull; increased globalization of economic activities and a deliberate selection of a more 
</p>
<p>market-oriented approach by many countries; 
</p>
<p>&bull; adoption of an export-oriented development strategy; 
</p>
<p>&bull; expanded role for multinational corporations (MNCs); 
&bull; structural adjustment programs (SAPs) advocated by the World Bank and Interna-
</p>
<p>tional Monetary Fund; and 
&bull; repositioning of the relative power of major global institutions. 
</p>
<p>Given this wide scope, global restructuring includes a variety of factors that impinge 
</p>
<p>on women's lives in the workplace and in the household (if the two sites differ). Global 
</p>
<p>restructuring affects women in the formal sector as well as in the informal and household 
</p>
<p>sectors in both rural and urban areas. The impact of global restructuring on women is a 
</p>
<p>worldwide issue, affecting women in industrialized countries in many of the same ways 
</p>
<p>as in developing countries. Although there have been some perceived benefits for women 
</p>
<p>in industry, the overall effect has been largely negative. 
</p>
<p>Many of the types of global restructuring listed previously overlap. I will discuss 
</p>
<p>each separately before exploring the linkages between them. 
</p>
<p>3.1. Globalization of Economic Activity, Increased Market Orientation 
</p>
<p>of Most Economies, and Counterforces 
</p>
<p>Increasingly, many dimensions of economic activity have become global phenomena: the 
</p>
<p>production and trading of goods and services, financial flows (including foreign direct </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>84 Jean L. Pyle 
</p>
<p>investment, portfolio investment, and aid), and the movement of people in search of 
income-earning opportunities. This has been facilitated by rapid changes in the technolo-
gies of communication and transportation, as well as by the liberalization of trade and 
capital flows that have occurred.' 
</p>
<p>How a nation is integrated into the global economy and the way international events 
impact on it can have a dramatic effect on the economic roles of its women. For example, 
an increase in a country's trade and/or in the amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) 
in its consumer goods or service sectors can correspond, at least in the short term, with an 
increase in women's access to jobs. This occurred in some Asian countries that began 
industrialization in the late 1960s and early 1970s (UN, 1995a). However, it is also the 
case that a particular trade policy can benefit one group of women while having an ad-
verse impact on another group of women. This happened, for example, when the terms of 
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) caused some garment production 
done by women in the Caribbean to be shifted to women in export industries in Mexico 
(Joekes &amp; Weston, 1994). 
</p>
<p>In addition to these general trends, many countries have deliberately chosen to be-
come more market oriented, further augmenting international flows of goods and ser-
vices, financial capital, and labor. The decision to become more market oriented or "lib-
eralized," with a putatively reduced role for the government in their economies, may 
apply to internal and/or external economic activities and may be voluntary or involun-
tary. This renewed movement toward market orientation was begun in the early 1980s by 
capitalist industrialized countries, such as the United States and Great Britain, that chose 
to move further in the direction of market coordination of economic activities. It was 
followed in the early 1990s by many previously socialist countries, particularly the former 
USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe, that have increasingly allowed markets rather 
than planners to make most of their economic decisions. Formerly communist countries 
in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam, have also begun this transition. Simultaneously, 
many Third World countries have been pressured by the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) and the World Bank (WB) into more market oriented approaches as a condition for 
loans or as part of a structural adjustment program. The IMF and the WB argue that 
market orientation is the appropriate means to achieve rapid growth and development 
and is the way to increase revenues to pay off a country's international debt. 
</p>
<p>Although these trends toward globalization and increased market orientation offer 
enhanced opportunities for some women, at least in the short term, this is not the case for 
many women for several reasons. First, the processes of globalization have occurred very 
unevenly. Developing countries' share of world trade actually fell from 1980 to 1992, 
from 29% to 24% (Joekes &amp; Weston, 1994). In addition. Third World countries' share of 
foreign direct investment has been extremely volatile, falling from 24% in 1985 to 13% 
in 1989, only to rise to 32% during the years 1992-94 (Finance &amp; Development, 1992; 
Panagariya, 1995). Only a small number of developing economies are significantly in-
volved. Two thirds of the flow of FDI to developing countries during the late 1980s went 
to a few countries in East Asia (China, Malaysia, and Thailand) and Latin America 
(Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia) (Finance &amp; Development, 1992). Integration 
between developed and developing countries is therefore skewed and benefits to most 
Third World countries are limited; many countries are left out of this type of global change 
and their per capita income remains at low levels. Women in these marginalized coun-
</p>
<p>' For example, with the passage of the Uruguay Round of GATT and the establishment of the World Trade Organi-
</p>
<p>zation, the WTO. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Third World Women and Global Restructuring 85 
</p>
<p>tries have little to no chance of participating in the economic growth and the rising 
standards of living that are occurring in some other countries. 
</p>
<p>Second, as a result of increased market orientation, inequalities are often widened 
between men and women within an economy. Increasing market orientation typically 
involves reduced support for social services (health or housing and food subsidies) and 
less regulation in hiring, wages, working conditions (health, safety, and the right to union-
ize), environmental conditions, and standards for products sold locally. These types of 
changes result in increasingly adverse conditions, particularly for women. This is the 
case because, almost universally, women are largely responsible for family well being and 
because they tend to be in jobs considered lower skilled, of lower value, and with poorer 
working conditions (UN, 1995b). Reduction in social services makes it much harder for 
women to maintain a standard of living in the household. With relaxation of regulation, 
any existing standards that might improve job conditions are reduced or eliminated. Such 
effects hold true for women in all countries moving toward increased market orientation, 
but particularly so for women in transitional economies. Seager (1997) points out that in 
1995 women's wages in Russia were 40% of men's, whereas they had been 70%. She also 
states that women in Eastern Europe experienced higher unemployment rates and de-
creased support for child and healthcare as transition proceeded. In addition, globally, 
with decreased regulation there is often an increase in "flexible" forms of work-part time 
or outwork that entails no benefits and can be terminated almost instantaneously. 
</p>
<p>Third, because of globalization and increasing market orientation of many coun-
tries, events in some nations increasingly impact on the economies of others in ways the 
latter cannot control. For example, increases in the interest rate in the United States in 
the early 1980s (as part of the monetarist approach to macromanaging the United States 
economy) triggered an international debt crisis. Years of reduced or stagnating growth of 
output and employment ensued in much of Latin America and Africa, with particularly 
adverse impacts on women (ILO, 1995). Similarly, the collapse of the peso in Mexico in 
late 1994 and the increasing poverty and social unrest there are linked to changes in the 
monetary policy of the United States. Even more recently, the financial crisis affecting 
many countries in Asia since the summer of 1997 was triggered by devaluation of the 
Thai baht; the crisis in Brazil in 1998 occurred immediately after the collapse of the 
Russian economy in August 1998. Much social unrest has accompanied these crises. Be-
cause women are largely responsible for family welfare, the effects fall heavily on them. 
</p>
<p>In short, although these dimensions of global restructuring&mdash;increasing globaliza-
tion of economic activity and the shift toward market economies by many countries&mdash; 
seem to draw the world together, the widening inequality within and between countries 
that is characteristic of more market-oriented capitalism becomes a countervailing force 
that is divisive. 
</p>
<p>In addition, although economic globalization has been accompanied and facilitated 
by the end of the Cold War and the disbanding of the major political camps into which 
countries were divided, there are newly arising political and religious forces that are 
divisive and have different economic effects by gender. On a relatively benign level, changes 
in the global political economy include the rise of regional trade blocks that can put 
countries outside the block at a competitive disadvantage, and affect the women in each 
accordingly. On a more violent level, political forces&mdash;increased nationalism, ethnic ri-
valries, and escalating conflicts often bordering on genocidal&mdash;divide countries from one 
another (e.g., in the Middle East), disrupt internal workings (e.g., in Sri Lanka, South 
Africa, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda) or splinter countries (e.g., the former USSR and former 
Yugoslavia). Such political and military conflicts have had a particularly adverse impact </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>86 Jean L. Pyle 
</p>
<p>on women's economic roles. Heyzer (1995) states that women and children are 75% of 
those affected or displaced in war-ravaged areas. When the Gulf War began in the early 
1990s, for example, large numbers of South and East Asian women who had migrated to 
the Middle East for work had to return to their home countries, losing their jobs and 
incomes. Further, many women in war-torn countries such as Rwanda or the former 
Yugoslavia have been murdered. Surviving women find it extremely difficult to provide 
for their families during ongoing strife and its aftermath, when they must pursue their 
activities in devastated economies on land that is often heavily mined. In countries such 
as Somalia and Rwanda, they live in constant fear of being raped (Dirasse, 1995). 
</p>
<p>In addition, fundamentalism has been growing throughout much of the world in 
Muslim, Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and Hindu religions and has led to more restric-
tions on women's legal, social, and economic roles in many areas (Seager, 1997). Chris-
tian and Muslim fundamentalism both view women's major role as being in the home. 
This compounds the effects of preexisting sociocultural systems that give men the more 
powerful positions in society, the workplace, and the household. For example, the Taliban, 
strict interpreters of Islam who took control in Afganistan in 1996, have prohibited women 
from working and closed girls' schools, severely restricting women's opportunities rela-
tive to men (Seager, 1997). 
</p>
<p>3.2 Export-Led Development Strategy 
</p>
<p>This type of global restructuring is based on the idea that high growth rates can be gener-
ated by production of manufactured goods or service activities for export. It is also re-
ferred to as the export-oriented or outward-looking strategy. In many countries it replaces 
an import-substitution strategy (ISI) that focused on domestic production of most pro-
ducer and consumer goods needed in the country. ISI emphasized heavy industry and em-
ployed largely male workforces, whereas export-led development relies heavily on women. 
</p>
<p>Export-led development was perceived as successful in the NICs&mdash;the newly indus-
trialized countries of Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore that adopted this 
strategy in the late 1960s. Because they achieved high growth rates and rising standards 
of living (from the late 1960s until the financial crisis in Asia in 1997) many other 
countries adopted this type of development approach. In addition, export-led develop-
ment has been widely promoted, even pushed, by the WB and the IMF in Latin American 
and even in Africa. 
</p>
<p>Export-led development often involves the attraction of multinational corporations 
(MNCs) and sometimes includes the use of export processing zones (EPZs) to ensure 
high rates of production for export. Increasingly, it encompasses enlarged networks of 
indigenous subcontractors, varying greatly in size, and other peripheral workers in small 
informal workshops or engaged in home-based work. Export-led development has relied 
heavily on sectors such as textiles and garments, shoes, toys, athletic wear, and electron-
ics to generate export revenues and employment.^ It now involves service sector work, 
</p>
<p>^ The establishment of an export-led development strategy requires trade liberalization, exchange rates favorable 
</p>
<p>for selling exports, and incentives to attract foreign investment or MNCs (as sole owners or in joint ventures). 
</p>
<p>Incentives can be in the form of lower taxes or complete tax holidays, freedom to repatriate profits, subsidies (for 
</p>
<p>credit, labor training, or export), decreased (or eliminated) environmental restrictions, reduced import duties, low 
</p>
<p>wages, maintaining a docile labor force (even if it means suppression of labor). Also needed are an adequate 
</p>
<p>infrastructure, political stability, an adequately educated labor force, and access to markets. It is often referred to 
</p>
<p>as a free-market strategy; however, as just described, it actually involves comprehensive sets of distinct policies 
</p>
<p>tailored and implemented by the government in ways to benefit corporations. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Third World Women and Global Restructuring 87 
</p>
<p>such as office administration and offshore data entry and processing, word processing, 
and invoicing for the travel and finance industries.' Export-led development has been 
linked with the feminization of the workforce in manufacturing and in some modern 
service sectors (Joekes &amp; Weston, 1994; Standing, 1989), although decreases over time in 
the percentage of women in the export sector workforce may modify the extent to which 
this can be argued. 
</p>
<p>Over the past three decades, such industries in East and Southeast Asia have been 
heavily based upon female labor, providing alternative types of employment for some 
women. Women are favored because they typically can be paid less than men and, given 
the level of technology, are generally considered more productive workers because of 
their abilities and willingness to work hard, their patience in tolerating repetitive and 
monotonous tasks, and their reluctance to unionize or resist (Lim, 1996). Women were 
lower-cost employees than men in the Asian NICs. For example, in 1982 women's earn-
ings as a percentage of men's in manufacturing were 45% in South Korea, 63% in 
Singapore, and 78% in Hong Kong. In 1987, the ratios were 50% in South Korea, 58% in 
Singapore, and 76% in Hong Kong (Pyle &amp; Dawson, 1990). In 1994, women still earned 
only 58% of men's wages in manufacturing in South Korea (Kim &amp; Kim, 1995). 
</p>
<p>The use of women workers in export-oriented development has been most carefully 
examined in the case of EPZs because these are self-contained areas that are relatively 
easier to study than women's roles in export production in general. Broader export pro-
duction includes subcontracting networks that are very fluid, with contracts initiated or 
terminated in rapid response to changes in demand. These networks are amorphous, hard 
to trace, and difficult to research. Although women comprise the larger proportion of 
workers in subcontracting, informal, and home-based economic activities (Joekes &amp; 
Weston, 1994), comprehensive data are not available. Therefore, although EPZs hire 
only a small proportion of the total number of women employed worldwide, analysis of 
their operations sheds light on the use of women in wider export sectors. 
</p>
<p>It has been estimated that, in the early 1990s, 4 million people were employed glo-
bally in EPZs, with 70% to 80% of these women (Joekes &amp; Weston, 1994; Lim, 1996). 
Although EPZs are present in over 65 countries (Seager, 1997), they are concentrated in 
only a few countries&mdash;Mexico, Dominican Republic, Brazil, Malaysia, Tunisia, Mauritius, 
Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and Guatemala (Joekes &amp; Weston, 1994)." The results of studies of 
conditions in EPZs vary&mdash;with some suggesting that wages are somewhat better than for 
similar jobs locally, others finding that the pay is even worse (Joekes &amp; Weston, 1994). 
The hazards to which women are exposed are typically substantial. 
</p>
<p>Two recent studies, in Sri Lanka and Malaysia, carefully document the economic 
and social impact of these zones on the female workers involved (Abeywardene, de Alwis, 
Jayasena, Jayaweera, &amp; Sanmugam, 1994; Sivalingam, 1994). The Sri Lankan study 
reveals that 85% of the workers in the EPZs are women, most of them young, unmarried, 
and from low-income families. Women are allocated the unskilled, routine work and 
constitute the preponderance of production workers, whereas men hold the technical and 
administrative jobs. Eighty percent of the workers interviewed reported that, if possible, 
they would leave their jobs in EPZs because of their dissatisfaction with working condi-
tions. The wages for women were below those for men for the same work. For example, 
female packers earned 1525 Sri Lankan Rupees (Rs.) a month, whereas male packers 
made 1800 Rs. Further, female operatives made 2000 Rs. a month while men operating 
</p>
<p>' These occur in Jamaica, Barbados, the Philippines, and China (Joekes &amp; Weston, 1994). 
</p>

<p/>

</p>
<p>the same machine earned 2500 Rs. a month. In addition, hours were often long, safety 
gear was rarely used, dismissals were arbitrary, and, although wages might be slightly 
higher than in comparable jobs outside the zones, housing accommodations were of poor 
quality and expensive, taking up to 50% of the monthly wage (Abeywardene et al., 1994). 
</p>
<p>The Malaysian study points out that production in EPZs is largely by foreign firms 
that recruit young, rural Malay women, aged 16-21, for semiskilled and unskilled pro-
duction work. They don't hire women older than 23 because they fear the "older" women 
will demand higher wages and leave for marriage. Women comprised more than 70% of 
production workers in the electronics plants surveyed in 1990 and 80% of production 
workers in textiles/garments. However, they constituted a low percentage of the manage-
rial and professional workers. Thus, women represented 57% of the workforce in EPZ 
textile/garment and electronic plants and 53% of the total workers in EPZs in 1990. 
Women's wages were 90% of men's in electronics and 80% in textiles/garments. Women 
face exposure to "excessive" (p. 43) heat and noise in textile production. In electronics, 
although the clean room concept makes it appear that women are working in a clean 
environment, they are exposed to toxic waste and hazardous chemicals. They are re-
quired to operate machines that were designed for a body larger than that of the typical 
woman, leading to accidents. They suffer eyestrain and deteriorating eyesight over a few 
years. Female electronics workers often have production standards that are excessively 
high, producing considerable stress. A larger percentage of the female workers are not 
permanent. For example, in the electronics plants, 30% of the female workforce was 
temporary and 20% were on probation as new employees. Turnover is high, particularly 
in the textile industry, because of the poor working conditions and the lack of upward job 
mobility (Sivahngam, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Women are also affected by export-oriented agricultural activities. However, even 
though large percentages of women are engaged in agriculture globally, such activities 
have been studied much less than those in the export manufacturing sector. Women may 
be included or excluded from export agricultural activities. In either case, their lives are 
precarious. On the one hand, women employed by agro-industry often have only seasonal 
work, and their income depends on the vagaries of the agricultural export markets (un-
predictable supplies and varying demand). This places them in a vulnerable position. On 
the other hand, women may be excluded from becoming producers themselves for the 
export market, because, as women, they are denied access to credit, technological devel-
opments, and information. In some cases, changes in women's and men's agricultural 
roles are complexly related to global changes in product demand, pricing, and migratory 
labor. Wee and Heyzer (1995) tell how women initially replaced Malaysian men as rubber 
tappers but then were replaced themselves by low-wage illegal male migrants from sur-
rounding countries that were economically more disadvantaged. 
</p>
<p>It has been widely noted that the number of women employed in industry increased 
during 1970-1990 in countries that adopted export-oriented development and had rapid 
growth in manufactured exports (Joekes &amp; Weston, 1994; UN, 1991b, 1995a). In addi-
tion, as discussed, increasing numbers of women in some countries are being employed in 
export-oriented service sectors and some may be involved in agricultural endeavors. How-
ever, it should not be concluded that export orientation is necessarily the way to increase 
female employment. The employment effects may be rather short lived and the percent-
age of women in export manufacturing may decrease as the technology involved in pro-
duction advances. For example, women's 53% share of Malaysian EPZ employment in 
1990 cited previously was a reduction from their 70% share in 1985. Similarly, women </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Third World Women and Global Restructuring 89 
</p>
<p>had comprised 78% of workers in Mexico's maquiladora industries in 1975, but were 
only 59% in 1993 (Cardero, 1994). 
</p>
<p>In addition to the largely adverse effects on women documented previously, export-
led development is a precarious strategy for maintaining or augmenting female employ-
ment for several reasons. First, this strategy involves increased competition with other 
countries. Not all countries can be successful in export-oriented manufacturing. Some 
will be more competitive than others. Although apparently successful in some areas in 
Southeast Asia, the strategy has been devastating in other areas, such as the Caribbean 
(McAfee, 1991). Its noted success in increasing female participation is limited to the 
eight Asian countries (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Malaysia, Phil-
ippines, and Thailand) from which 80% of the increase in manufactured exports from 
developing countries came (UN, 1991b). 
</p>
<p>Second, the success of an export-oriented strategy is highly dependent on viable 
markets in other countries. The export-oriented country is therefore vulnerable to reces-
sions that curtail demand in the countries to which they export. Fluctuations in demand 
directly impact on the female production workers involved. To illustrate, during the 1974-
75 downturn, 50% of those laid off in Singapore were women, even though they were 
only 30% of the labor force at the time. In the 1985 recession, 60% of those laid off were 
women, although only 35% of the Singaporean labor force. The reason for these dispari-
ties is that 90% of the layoffs involved production workers, who were largely female 
(Pyle, 1994). More recently, the financial crises beginning in the summer of 1997 have 
reduced demand in areas ranging from Asia to Russia and Brazil, with serious effects on 
other nations that export to them. Many workers in the countries involved have lost their 
jobs. An article in Finance &amp; Development, a publication of the IMF, reports that the 
total loss of jobs will be large {Finance &amp; Development, 1998). Complete data by gender 
is not yet available because of the recentness of the events. Anecdotal news reports sug-
gest that women's jobs have been heavily hit. 
</p>
<p>Last, in opening its economy to the rest of the world, the country pursuing export 
oriented development based largely on low-cost female labor not only exposes the women 
involved to the conditions (whether advantageous or disadvantageous) of this type of 
work, but also gives up much sovereign control. National economic outcomes now be-
come heavily influenced by external forces, such as flows of capital, the existence of 
markets, or deliberate legislation passed in the importing country. The way export-ori-
ented development operates can be for the benefit of corporations based in other countries 
rather than citizens of the export-oriented country. For example, Safa (1995) shows how 
the United States (U.S.) government shaped export-oriented development in the Carib-
bean in the 1980s to provide sites with low-cost labor for U.S. industry. The U.S. govern-
ment established carefully tailored trade legislation that specified only assembly could 
occur in these areas, used U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) financ-
ing, and heavily advertised the special zones as sites for U.S. firms to use for production. 
The workers involved were chiefly low-wage women. This did not lead to sustainable 
development in the Dominican Republic because industrial activities were limited to as-
sembly operations performed by foreign rather than indigenous firms.

<p>3.3 The Spread of MNCs and Their Cost-Cutting Strategies 
</p>
<p>Corporations have become much more global in terms of function, origin, and location 
</p>
<p>since the early 1980s. MNCs are present internationally in sectors ranging from heavy </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>90 Jean L. Pyle 
</p>
<p>industry (petrochemicals, automobiles) to consumer goods (shoes and clothing, electron-
ics, toys, athletic goods) to services (hotel and airline reservations, claims processing). It 
is the consumer goods and some service sectors that employ large numbers of women. 
</p>
<p>MNCs now originate from increasingly diverse home countries: industrialized coun-
tries other than the United States, particularly Japan and Western Europe; the newly 
industrializing countries of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore; and even 
other developing countries. They have expanded the areas in which they locate produc-
tion to include additional tiers of developing countries (such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka), 
as well as formerly socialist economies in Eastern Europe and Asia (Vietnam and China). 
Although FDI by multinational corporations has grown faster than world output, world 
trade, and domestic investment (ILO, 1995), and although flows to developing countries 
have increased particularly rapidly, global distribution has been skewed, affecting the 
economic roles of women in Third World countries accordingly. The spread of MNCs has 
largely been into other industrialized countries. In the developing world, just 10 coun-
tries have more than three quarters of the stock of FDI in the Third World, while the 47 
least-developed nations have less than 1%.̂  Because MNCs are motivated chiefly to seek 
profits, among the key factors they consider in selecting a foreign location are lower-cost 
production opportunities (e.g., regarding wages or regulatory costs), accessibility to mar-
kets or resources, appropriately skilled (or unskilled) workers, and political stability. 
Competition for FDI is often very keen and many nations have little chance in the rivalry. 
</p>
<p>MNCs have a growing impact on women not only because of their increased direct 
presence globally but also because of the wider spheres of influence associated with their 
increased use of subcontracting and homework networks of production. They are the 
most dynamic segment of business internationally, continually increasing their geographic 
spread and altering their cost-cutting strategies in ways that affect growing numbers of 
people. In industrial sectors in which wages are a substantial portion of total costs&mdash;such 
as garments and textiles, electronics, toys, shoes, athletic gear&mdash;MNCs employ largely 
female production workers in their formal and informal networks.* For similar reasons, 
women are employed in service sector activities run by MNCs. Therefore, when these 
sectors expand (or contract) job opportunities are created (or diminished) for women. 
</p>
<p>It is estimated that, in 1993, MNCs directly employed 11 million people in develop-
ing countries, with a high percentage of women in the sectors just described. In addition, 
because the indirect networks are thought to add a multiple of between one and two, the 
total employment in the larger networks may be 20 to 30 million in developing countries 
(Joekes &amp; Weston, 1994). MNCs provide more than 20% of manufacturing employment 
in Asian countries such as Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines. They 
provide more than one fifth in Latin American countries of Argentina, Mexico, Barba-
dos, and in the African countries of Botswana and Mauritius (Joekes &amp; Weston, 1994). 
</p>
<p>3.3.1. GENERAL EFFECTS OF M N C S . Earlier debates over whether women benefited 
</p>
<p>from or were disadvantaged by employment in MNCs have been replaced by a more 
</p>
<p>complex analysis that addresses the dynamics and contradictions involved with female 
</p>
<p>MNC employment. In the very short term, employment in MNCs may appear to provide 
</p>
<p>' The 10 largest host countries in the developing world in 1988-89 were Argentina, Brazil, China, Columbia, 
</p>
<p>Egypt, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and Thailand. 
</p>
<p>* For the reasons cited before&mdash;because women are lower cost workers, are considered dexterous, are often willing 
to work long hours at very repetitive tasks, and are generally compliant. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Third World Women and Global Restructuring 91 
</p>
<p>greater material benefit to the women and their families than existing income-earning 
alternatives. There is also evidence that, although wages are low in MNCs relative to 
industrialized countries, and working conditions more adverse, MNCs in many areas 
offer conditions and pay that are slightly better than those of other local, domestically 
owned employers (Joekes &amp; Weston, 1994; Sivalingam, 1994; Todaro, 1997). However, 
negative aspects are often obvious in the short term in the form of long hours, forced 
overtime, increased production quotas or speedups, poor working conditions or housing, 
stress, and harassment from management. The adverse impact is more clear in the longer 
term, when these women experience work-related deterioration of health, the lack of 
benefits, the absence of opportunities to gain skills and advance in the job hierarchy, and 
loss of jobs due to their health, work-related stress, or strategies of automation, retrench-
ment, or relocation of the MNCs (discussed later). 
</p>
<p>These general effects vary according to how long the country has been pursuing 
export-oriented growth and the particular corporate cost-cutting strategies adopted (dis-
cussed in the next section). Countries that utilized this strategy in earlier decades have 
been consciously moving from labor-intense sectors to more high-tech industries. For 
women employed in MNCs in the NICs, such as Singapore or Hong Kong, who have 
escaped loss of jobs due to strategies discussed just below, working conditions and absolute 
wage levels have improved somewhat over time as a result of worker resistance. Nonetheless, 
conditions of female employment in MNCs vary even within the NICs. For example, in 
Singapore there has been a dramatic increase in female employment and a narrowing of 
the male/female wage gap since the 1960s; in South Korea women remained a more 
peripheral workforce, with relatively short working lives. The difference may be due to 
the tighter labor market in Singapore and state support (Phongpaichit, 1988). 
</p>
<p>However, although conditions (regarding wages and perhaps health and safety stan-
dards) may have improved in some NICs, adverse conditions persist in most other devel-
oping countries. Conditions are the worst in the latest group of countries to adopt export-
oriented growth&mdash;the second tier of countries to follow the NICs (Thailand, Malaysia, 
Indonesia, or the Philippines) or the third tier (Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, areas of China 
and India). As the MNCs move into the latest tier of countries that are pursuing export-
led development, where local working conditions are often even worse, they adopt the 
same patterns regarding pay, hours, and working conditions as when they established 
operations in the NICs. Women often earn very low wages with no benefits and work long 
hours that can be increased at the will of the employer. They are often exposed to health 
and safety hazards (because of exposure to toxic chemicals or lint and dust and due to 
lack of enforcement of standards), may have limited access to sanitary facilities, and may 
be verbally or sexually abused. 
</p>
<p>In addition, patterns of women's participation in MNC employment networks differ 
by factors such as age, marital status, race/ethnicity, class, culture, and the design of state 
policy as well as by gender (Blumberg, Rakowski, Tinker, &amp; Monteon, 1995; Pyle, 1998; 
Rakowski, 1995; Ward, 1990; Ward &amp; Pyle, 1995). For example, age and cultural con-
ventions interact to shape where women are employed in the greater MNC production 
networks. Direct employment in MNCs in labor-intensive industries in Asia typically 
involves young unmarried women. The subcontracting networks in Hong Kong and South 
Korea, however, often utilize married women who are older (Pun, 1995), as does the 
garment homework sector in the Philippines (Ofreneo, 1994). State policy also affects 
women's employment in MNCs. State policy during export-led development in Singapore 
was designed to bring women into the labor force and provide a workforce for MNCs; in </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>92 Jean L. Pyle 
</p>
<p>the Republic of Ireland, another small island economy pursuing the same development 
strategy, state policy was explicitly designed to pursue firms that would employ larger 
proportions of males (Pyle, 1990, 1994). 
</p>
<p>3.3.2. EFFECTS OF COST-CUTTING STRATEGIES OF M N C S . M N C S have used four 
types of global cost-cutting strategies in the past decade at an accelerated pace in both 
industrialized and developing countries. They are particularly intensified when competi-
tion increases. These strategies affect all industries&mdash;heavy industry that hires largely 
males as well as light industries that hire larger percentages of women. Although they 
affect both male and female workers internationally, the focus here is on the effects on the 
female workforces in lighter industry. 
</p>
<p>As costs have risen in specific areas in which MNCs have been producing, they have 
chosen one or more of the following responses: to suppress labor demands; to automate; 
to increase the use of homeworking or subcontracting to other businesses within the country; 
or to move to another tier of low-cost countries. Each of these strategies has had largely 
adverse effects on the women and children involved as workers in the original location. 
</p>
<p>First, although a few MNCs pay wages in some developing countries that are attrac-
tive locally, there is considerable evidence that they actively suppress workers' demands 
for higher wages and desires to improve other job conditions. When such refusal to nego-
tiate leads to worker efforts to unionize, MNCs counter these activities via threats or 
dismissals (Safa, 1994) and some workers turn up missing, presumed dead (Ofreneo, 
1994. They often quell labor unrest with the assistance of the police or the military, as 
recently exemplified in Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Korea. In addition, MNCs 
derail some management-labor conflicts via programs (such as quality circles) that ap-
pear to give workers some input into the decision-making and labor process, while not 
transferring effective power. Such actions harm women physically and psychologically, 
and tend to reinforce their subordinate status. 
</p>
<p>Second, MNCs may automate or adopt more advanced technologies. It is largely 
female jobs that are replaced by machines. For example, a study of the semiconductor 
industry in Malaysia revealed that although net employment increased between 1977 and 
1984, the proportion of female workers fell. This occurred because the industry became 
more technical, hiring more skilled labor, technicians, and engineers, most of whom 
were males (Salih &amp; Young, 1989). In addition, it is likely that as computerized processes 
become more viable in the garment industry, and as text and voice recognition systems 
are implemented in computer work, it is chiefly female employment that will drop. 
</p>
<p>Third, MNCs often relocate to lower-wage countries or areas within a country. MNCs 
move into a new country as direct producers, via subcontracting, or in joint ventures 
where a MNC and a local enterprise jointly own the business. As MNCs in labor-inten-
sive industries relocate, women in the new location gain employment while women at the 
original site lose their jobs. The newly unemployed are often unable to find other employ-
ment, particularly if they gained no new marketable skills at these jobs. For example, a 
company closure in South Korea's Masan Free Export Zone (Mafez), where the workforce 
was 75% female, focused attention on what has been called an industrial ghetto for women. 
These women left school early to work in the MNC and had few skills transferable to 
more high-tech jobs when companies closed. The paradox was that, at the time. South 
Korea had a shortage of labor. Such misuse of female labor is inefficient, in addition to 
inequitable. It is widely expected to be the trend, however, throughout the labor-intensive 
industries in garments, footwear, and toys in South Korea and other NICs. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Third World Women and Global Restructuring 93 
</p>
<p>Fourth, under the innocuous rubric of augmenting "flexibility," corporations increas-
ingly contract work out to subcontracting and/or homework networks throughout the 
industrialized and developing world. In contrast to workers in factories, workers in such 
networks cost MNCs substantially less because they work for significantly lower pay, can 
be easily terminated, have no benefits, require little to no fixed capital, and are less likely 
to organize or unionize. As MNCs increase the use of subcontracting and homework 
networks, it is often women who are employed. This type of work involves contradictions 
for women. On the one hand, it allows women who are married or household heads the 
flexibility to combine paid work with household duties. On the other hand, the women 
are even more vulnerable economically because they are paid less, have no benefits, and 
can be terminated immediately in the event of an economic downturn. 
</p>
<p>Subcontracting networks often involve informal sector jobs, illustrating how increased 
MNC production affects women in the informal sector as well as the formal sector. Beneria 
and Roldan (1987) were among the first to extend the analysis of the effect of MNCs on 
women beyond formal employment (paid labor in MNC factories) to the informal sector. 
They examined the layers of subcontracting and homework arrangements that were de-
veloped by MNCs in Mexico City and examined the blurred line between formal and 
informal work. This has also been studied in South Korea and the Philippines (Lee &amp; 
Song, 1994; Ofreneo, 1994). Further, just as MNC networks have increasingly encom-
passed informal sector employment, indigenous industrial firms do so also, thereby in-
creasing the adverse conditions for women. 
</p>
<p>Although the effects of employment in MNCs on women are somewhat contradic-
tory, they are largely negative. This is compounded by the fact that activities in the sub-
contracting networks often associated with MNCs are typically more hidden from public 
view, providing them the opportunity to treat workers even less favorably. Additional 
inequities and worker abuses are rife. In spite of the visibility of a few prominent cases in 
recent years, these subcontracting networks are harder to influence. In addition, it is 
feared that MNCs originating from Asian countries (such as South Korea or Taiwan) that 
move production into other countries in the region will be less responsible because of 
their high degree of anonymity internationally. They often produce components, products 
that will be used to assemble other final goods, and are therefore isolated from consumer 
awareness; they have displayed little concern for social or environmental concerns. 
</p>
<p>3.4. Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) 
</p>
<p>The role of structural adjustment policies (SAPs) has been prominent and controversial 
</p>
<p>for the past twenty years. In the early 1980s many developing countries encountered 
</p>
<p>serious economic problems. The 1979 oil crisis, with the accompanying rapid increases 
</p>
<p>in the price of oil, began a set of global recessions. Rising interest rates in the United 
</p>
<p>States precipitated the international debt crisis that severely affected many countries in 
</p>
<p>the developing world. With the exception of some countries in Asia, most of the develop-
</p>
<p>ing world was engulfed in widespread stagnation or recession for the next few years. 
</p>
<p>SAPs, designed to stabilize and restructure an economy, were required as a condition of 
</p>
<p>borrowing from the IMF and the WB and, in turn, to obtain loans from private commer-
</p>
<p>cial banks in developed countries (banks required IMF backing). SAPs were established 
</p>
<p>throughout Latin America and in over thirty countries in Africa during the 1980s (Haddad, 
</p>
<p>Brown, Richter, &amp; Smith, 1995). Many countries borrowed heavily from the IMF and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>94 Jean L. Pyle 
</p>
<p>WB7 However, these programs brought hardship to people in much of the developing 
world, with particularly adverse impact on women (Lim, 1996; UN, 1995b). More re-
cently, S APs have been an integral part of financial bailout packages arranged by the IMF 
for many countries involved in the financial crises arising since July (for example, Thai-
land, Indonesia, South Korea, and Russia). The stringency of the policies required, their 
recessionary impact, and the way they distribute the impact of the crises on lower-income 
peoples have fostered considerable controversy and unrest. 
</p>
<p>SAPs are based upon traditional neoclassical economic theory&mdash;a model that is cri-
tiqued from a variety of points of view, including its failure to systematically include 
gender as an integral component of the analysis. SAPs have been conceptualized as hav-
ing two components: one a stabilization phase (designed to stabilize key economic indi-
cators, such as inflation rates, government budget deficits, or trade deficits), the other a 
restructuring or structural adjustment phase (intended to make the stabilized economy 
more competitive by moving toward a more market-oriented economy with less govern-
ment intervention). The stabilization component was to be relatively short term and lay 
the foundation for enhanced economic growth, which would be encouraged over a longer 
term through the restructuring phase. Policies for both phases have been implemented 
together. Both can have unfavorable effects on women, although there is at least the 
possibility that the restructuring component could open up opportunities for some women. 
</p>
<p>Accomplishing these main goals involves a myriad of other deliberate economic 
policy changes, most of which negatively impact women. For example, according to tra-
ditional neoclassical economic theory, stabilizing prices requires contractionary fiscal 
policies (reducing government spending or increasing taxes) or restrictive monetary policy 
(higher interest rates). It can also involve wage freezes. Stabilization policies are de-
signed to attain price stability and assist in reducing deficits; they are not focused on 
stability in employment. In addition, policies to make an economy more competitive do-
mestically and internationally involve privatizing state-owned enterprises, devaluation 
of the exchange rate (to make exports more price competitive abroad), and a host of 
specific policies to promote export-oriented development. Opening a country to MNCs is 
often part of the agenda.* 
</p>
<p>In general, stabilization and SAPs required by the IMF and WB promote market 
orientation, establish policies favorable for corporations, and implicitly reinforce the lack 
of concern for employment, income inequality, and fair treatment for all. SAPS enacted 
in the 1980s and early 1990s have resulted in rising unemployment, falling incomes and 
standards of living, worsening income distribution, increasing poverty, deteriorating 
working conditions, and environmental degradation. These factors, in turn, undermine 
long-term growth rates, one of the goals of the SAPs in the first place (UN, 1991b).' 
</p>
<p>' The biggest borrowers from the IMF 1980-1992 were Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, the former Yugosla-
</p>
<p>via, the Philippines, Morocco, Ghana, Bangladesh, and Bolivia. 
</p>
<p>' This may involve tax holidays, free repatriation of profits, subsidies on worker training and interest rates, reduced 
</p>
<p>import duties, deregulation of environmental standards and labor conditions standards regarding minimum wage, 
</p>
<p>rights to form unions, and working conditions. As discussed earlier, such policies typically benefit corporations, 
</p>
<p>often based in other countries. 
</p>
<p>' As a UN (1991b) publication states, "Although mainstream economists generally regard structural adjustment 
</p>
<p>policies as necessary to lay the groundwork for steady economic growth, these policies are often criticized for 
</p>
<p>failing to accomplish economic restructuring without adversely impacting long-term growth prospects and pov-
</p>
<p>erty and environmental sustainability concerns and for not taking account of the country-specific circumstances of 
</p>
<p>economic reform" (p. 14). In the early 1990s, the IMF reevaluated to try to lessen the adverse impacts of the 
</p>
<p>policies. However, because of the nature of the market system and the ideology of the prevailing orthodoxy, it is 
</p>
<p>difficult to diminish the adverse effects. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Third World Women and Global Restructuring 95 
</p>
<p>It is widely concluded that the earlier rounds of SAPs have a gender bias that is 
unfavorable for women (Aslanbeigui, Pressman, &amp; Summerfield, 1994; Bakker, 1994; 
Rakowski, 1995; Sparr, 1994; Thomas-Emeagwali, 1995; UN, 1991b, 1995a). The stabi-
lization phase, thought to be short term, has had distinctly adverse effects on all people, 
but more so on women. Evaluating the effects of the restructuring phase, however, is 
considered more difficult because of the problems of assessing the effects of particular 
policy changes in a social environment where so much is changing over the medium to 
longer term. If women are able to benefit from changes in the incentive structure that 
restructuring establishes (i.e., it favors the tradable goods sectors), they can benefit from 
adjustment. However, women are at a distinct disadvantage because of their limited ac-
cess to resources and the constraints on their ability to reallocate resources (including 
their own labor) in line with changes in adjustment incentives (Haddad et al., 1995). 
</p>
<p>To illustrate, government spending can be reduced in several different ways, each of 
which affects women adversely. It can be curtailed by cutting public sector employment 
(including in publicly owned industries). Because women often are employed in the pub-
lic sector, this hits them disproportionately hard (UN, 1991b). Government budgets can 
also be reduced by curtailing spending on social services (such as health care, family 
planning, education, and training) and removing subsidies for basic needs, such as food-
stuffs and transportation. Cuts in education and training budgets often harm women, 
because, in many societies, women have less access to education than men and govern-
ment programs have helped to alleviate this inequity. In addition, because women are 
overwhelmingly responsible for family well-being, they are dramatically affected by re-
duction in spending on health care and family planning as well as on subsidies (UN, 
1995b). They find themselves with significantly fewer resources to provide for the needs 
of the household. As government social services are eliminated, these formerly free goods 
must be paid for. Prices of needed household items also rise when subsidies on food and 
transportation are reduced or eliminated (UN, 1995b). 
</p>
<p>If curtailing the country's federal budget involves increases in taxes, they are typi-
cally of the type that fall regressively on the poor, of which women are a disproportionate 
number (UN, 1995b). In addition, contractionary fiscal policies usually result in reces-
sions in which layoffs are widespread; as shown earlier, women's jobs are typically the 
most vulnerable in a recession. Restrictive monetary policies entail higher interest rates 
which make it even harder for women to obtain funds for entrepreneurial activity (UN, 
1991b). Wage freezes unmatched by price freezes cause a decline in real purchasing power. 
This lowers the standard of living and increases poverty, making it harder for women to 
meet the needs of their families. 
</p>
<p>As women lose jobs in the formal sector and find household resources drastically 
squeezed by stabilization and structural adjustment policies, they are typically forced into 
informal sector employment, which pays less and is much more precarious (UN, 1995b). 
They often must work longer hours and make sacrifices in consumption and healthcare. 
As regulations regarding the environment and conditions at the workplace are eliminated 
or left unenforced, the environmental quality of worklife, as well as life in general, di-
minishes. As people must competitively scramble into the informal sector to eke out a 
living, further environmental damage occurs. Some are forced into taking part-time work 
(which may combine better with home duties) and others may set up an informal sector 
business. However, preexisting inequalities in many countries largely keep women from 
participating in many entrepreneurial activities. Women are typically discriminated against 
by formal lending agencies because they lack collateral. They must utilize informal sector 
money lenders, who charge much higher interest rates (UN, 1991b). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>96 Jean L. Pyle 
</p>
<p>These structural adjustment programs have affected women and men throughout the 
world. If countries were able to recover from the contractionary stabilization policies and 
restructure, those who were able to move into sectors that were favored by the programs 
(chiefly the tradable goods sectors) could benefit (Haddad et al., 1995). The effects of 
these earlier rounds of S APs on women in Asia were contradictory. It was here that women 
were able to achieve some benefit from structural adjustments that opened their econo-
mies to trade and possibly foreign investment. Many women gained jobs as a result of the 
restructuring. However, as documented earlier in the sections on export-led development 
and MNCs, this was not completely beneficial. Although many women had jobs that were 
possibly better than the alternatives they faced, we have seen how many of the conditions 
surrounding work (such as wages, hours, health and safety, or treatment by management) 
were distinctly unfavorable. 
</p>
<p>During the 1980s, many countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa ini-
tiated SAPs and opted for more market orientation and export-led development. They did 
so either because they were pressured by the IMF and the WB as a condition for loans or 
because they were suffering from recessions or stagnation and wanted to replicate the 
success of the NICs. SAPs particularly worsened the socioeconomic position of women in 
these areas. With women's wage employment falling in Latin America and unemploy-
ment rising, women were forced into the informal sector. Government cutbacks in health 
care were severe, as were cuts in education and training. As health deteriorates, women 
are less able to work; as educational opportunities decrease, women are less able to attain 
needed skills. In many developing countries women worked long hours to maintain even 
meager living standards. 
</p>
<p>Often the lower and middle income people affected by such increasing deprivation 
become frustrated and angry. Many demonstrations have occurred to protest the SAPs, 
often organized and led by women. In addition, concerns have erupted into revolt, fight-
ing, disorder, and deaths which clearly disrupt economic and social life. SAPs contain 
within them seeds of their own and social destruction. Others have linked the frustrations 
generated by the worsening income distribution that SAPs create to the rise of "funda-
mentalism, fascism, and ethnic conflicts" (Sen, 1995, p. 11), which as we have seen in 
Section 3.1, greatly constrains women's opportunities and, in some cases, subjects them 
to violence ranging from beating, rape, to death. 
</p>
<p>The newest rounds of SAPs, required as conditions for IMF financial assistance 
designed to address the financial crises that began in 1997, appear to affect inhabitants of 
recipient countries in similar ways. An article in Finance &amp; Development (an IMF pub-
lication) indicates that poverty will increase in Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand 
through price increases and loss of jobs (Finance &amp; Development, 1998). There are news 
reports that people in the broader group of countries affected are experiencing severe 
hardship and deprivation, unrest and resistance, and death. There are indications of their 
particularly adverse impact on women&mdash;in terms of loss of jobs and in providing for 
household needs. More aggregate country-wide data is now emerging in government 
statistics that can provide a broader basis on which to evaluate the impact of these poli-
cies by class and gender. 
</p>
<p>3.5. Institutional Restructuring 
</p>
<p>Another way to understand global restructuring is to consider changes in major institu-
</p>
<p>tions in the global political economy and shifts in the balance of power among them. The 
</p>
<p>major institutions in the macro global economy are: MNCs and their production net-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Third World Women and Global Restructuring 97 
</p>
<p>works, international organizations (such as the WB, the IMF, the UN, and the ILO), 
national governments, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) or grassroots organi-
zations concerned with gender issues. These institutions, and changes in them, shape the 
power structure within which women live and work. 
</p>
<p>As discussed previously, the structural changes in MNCs&mdash;their countries of origin, 
the areas into which they have spread, and their four-pronged cost-cutting strategies&mdash; 
have had a dramatic effect on women in industry. They are motivated to seek profits and 
increase markets, rather than by concerns for equity. They are not concerned with allevi-
ating rising income inequality, reducing unemployment, treating women/people equally, 
or preserving the environment. 
</p>
<p>Among the international organizations are the IMF, and the WB, and numerous UN 
organizations. On the one hand, as shown previously, there is widespread documentation 
that the SAPs required by the WB and the IMF have hurt most women. These two insti-
tutions are motivated to loan money according to the standards of the prevailing neoclas-
sical economic paradigm and to ensure that borrowers are able to repay loans and funds 
are not lost. Because they hold the pursestrings and their approval is often necessary for 
additional private loans, they have considerable power to enforce their view. 
</p>
<p>On the other hand, many UN organizations are motivated to improve the socioeco-
nomic status of women, but they have limited funds and little power. The UN agencies 
have produced increasing amounts of information that is the basis for a better under-
standing of the status of women globally and their importance to development and family 
well-being, and for the development of strategies to improve women's lives. Among the 
more comprehensive recent publications in terms of data and policy recommendations 
are The World's Women 1995: Trends and Statistics (co-sponsored by II UN partner 
organizations) and the Human Development Report 1995 of the UN Development 
Programme (UNDP). The latter focuses on gender disparities and, not only provides ex-
tensive data, but also develops two new measures of the development status of countries 
that incorporate gender: the Gender Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empow-
erment Measure (GEM). The GDI considers inequalities between men and women in 
longevity, literacy, and standard of living whereas the GEM includes women's share of 
parliamentary positions, managerial and professional jobs, and income, as well as their 
labor force participation rates. 
</p>
<p>UNIFEM (the United Nations Development Fund for Women) had its roots in the 
First UN conference on Women in 1975 and is focused on promoting the economic and 
political empowerment of women. Its activities range from funding capacity building 
among women in Third World countries to reexamination of development models and 
formation of gender sensitive macro-models. It is designed to ensure that women and 
their concerns are included in mainstream development planning, to support experimen-
tal programs to benefit women and their country's overall priorities, and to be a catalyst 
for these concerns throughout the greater UN system (UNIFEM, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Similarly, the ILO has tried to set and increase standards in the workplace; however, 
it lacks enforcement powers. It published an extensive follow-up to the Fourth World 
Conference on Women (1995) and the World Summit for Social Development (1995) that 
outlines plans to implement the declarations of these two summits regarding equality of 
opportunity for women in employment and qualitative improvements in working condi-
tions (see Lim, 1996, More and Better Jobs for Women: An Action Guide, 1996). It 
addresses inequalities by gender in hiring, pay, occupations, decision making, unemploy-
ment, access to training, promotions and resources, and in family responsibilities. Again, 
it has no authority to execute these ideas. </p>

</p>
<p>National governments are another set of players on the macro global scene. Most do 
not incorporate women into development planning. An INSTRAW study revealed that 
only six of 96 countries surveyed mentioned women's issues in their development plans 
(Vickers, 1991). National governments are interested in growth rates, price stability, and 
surviving financial, political, or military crises. Provision of stable levels of high employ-
ment is essentially not on their agendas. Many governments have restructured their econo-
mies, as required by the SAPs or to pursue export-led growth; many have sought to attract 
MNCs and FDI. There is intense international competition for FDI, and, as each country 
seeks to make itself an attractive location, it often further weakens any existing labor 
standards (regarding wages, hours, benefits, working conditions, and rights to unionize) 
by failing to enforce them or by deregulation. Rather than devoting substantial attention 
to human development or sustainable development, they take an immediate and short-
run perspective that perpetuates the institutions in power. These are typically the same 
institutions that have resulted in past and present inequality. The effects on women have 
been documented throughout this chapter, particularly in the sections on export-oriented 
development, MNCs, and structural adjustment policies. 
</p>
<p>There are many NGOs working on gender and development issues. Chen (1995) 
documents the dramatic increases in women's NGOs in the past two decades and their 
increasing importance at the various world conferences held regarding women (1975, 
1980, 1985, 1995) or the conferences on human rights (1993) and population and devel-
opment (1994). These NGOs have arisen in a great number of countries; many have built 
large and sophisticated alliances among themselves on critical issues. They range from 
small grassroots organizations to coalitions that span major regions of the world, and 
often bridge the North-South gap that is said to exist between women and countries in 
general. However, it is difficult for the few international organizations that have human 
development as their agenda and the myriad of NGOs to stand up successfully against the 
corporations, the WB and IMF, national governments, and patriarchal cultural restraints. 
There is no major institutional grouping with the power to blunt the negative impact of 
the global market system on women. 
</p>
<p>4. EFFECTS OF GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING ON WOMEN 
IN INDUSTRY: ANALYTICAL LINKAGES 
</p>
<p>There are clear analytical linkages between the continuation of women's disadvantaged 
status and the various types of global restructuring&mdash;the increasing globalization and 
market orientation of the world's economy, export-oriented development strategies advo-
cated by the WB and the IMF, changing corporate strategies of MNCs and their networks, 
and SAPs. 
</p>
<p>There are causal links, for example, between the spread of MNCs and the use of 
</p>
<p>SAPs, on the one hand, and increases in women's participation in the informal sector on 
</p>
<p>the other. As discussed previously, these two global phenomena have drawn increasing 
</p>
<p>numbers of women into informal sector activities simply so the women could survive. 
</p>
<p>When SAPs have been implemented in many countries, women have lost jobs in the 
</p>
<p>formal sector and, in a variety of ways, have lost resources to provide for their families as 
</p>
<p>governments cut back expenses. For both reasons women have been increasingly forced 
</p>
<p>into informal sector employment. In addition, MNCs have increasingly utilized cost-
</p>
<p>cutting strategies (automation, relocation, increased subcontracting) that force many </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Third World Women and Global Restructuring 99 
</p>
<p>women into informal sector worlc. Women are often involved in informal industrial work 
because they can combine it with home duties. However, such employment pays much 
less, is very unstable, and conditions are even worse than in formal sector jobs. 
</p>
<p>Because of the characteristics of informal sector employment, poverty increases. 
Income is lower and women are forced to work longer hours. This trend is particularly 
devastating for households headed by women (up to 30% in some areas) and for immi-
grant women who are especially vulnerable (UN, 1991b). As poverty and inequality in-
crease, in turn additional crises of unemployment, inflation, even famine or political 
upheaval result. Without some significant change, this chain of events will be perpetuated. 
</p>
<p>This dynamic and the analytic linkages between women's continued disadvantaged 
status and these forms of global restructuring, result from several characteristics of the 
global market system as a whole and the traditional neoclassical approach to economics 
(the prevailing orthodoxy) upon which the market system and much of the global restruc-
turing is based: (1) gender is not a variable of analysis, resulting in a misspecified basis 
for policy making; (2) in addition, markets do not consider equity as a goal, which can 
undermine the market goals of efficiency and long-term growth; and (3) the notion that 
these forms of global restructuring are a move toward free markets is a myth obscuring the 
reality that the global economy is dominated a few powerful institutions, none of which gov-
ern or monitor it with the primary goal of human development or gender equity in mind. 
</p>
<p>First, traditional economic analysis, and the policies constructed upon its view of the 
socioeconomy and enacted worldwide, have not included gender as a variable of analysis. 
They are not, however, gender-neutral in their impact because women and men have 
distinctly different occupations and responsibilities in the economies of most countries. 
Women are largely responsible for housework (which has been invisible in national in-
come accounts until recently) and men and women typically fill different types of jobs in 
the paid labor force, with women in the lower-paid jobs with less responsibility. 
</p>
<p>On the microeconomic level, according to neoclassical economic theory, the per-
fectly competitive economy has a large number of small actors (firms, workers, consum-
ers), none of whom have control over prices. Forces of supply and demand interact in free 
markets with perfect information and therefore outcomes are fairly determined. This micro-
economic approach assumes that everyone has the same opportunities. If someone is in a 
disadvantaged position in the labor market, for example, it is thought to be because they 
chose this position or because they did not acquire sufficient human capital (education, 
training, or experience). Any possible discrimination against particular groups (such as 
women) would simply be a short-term phenomenon that firms would find it profitable to 
eradicate (i.e., if women were paid lower wages, capitalists would make more money by 
hiring them, thus driving up their wages relative to those of men). Feminist economists, 
and others, have for years documented the fact that such variables cannot statistically 
account for the major proportion of the wage gap that exists between men and women. 
</p>
<p>Macroeconomic theory is even more removed from gender. It focuses on such vari-
ables as output, growth rates, prices, unemployment, interest rates, money supply, gov-
ernment spending, taxation, and exchange rates. People are not mentioned other than in 
employment/unemployment figures. Further, the focus of macroeconomic policy makers 
in developed countries has been on price rather than on employment variables. Tradi-
tional economics has defined work as tasks that are valued by and paid for through mar-
kets, thus making the vast amount of economic activity that women perform unpaid in 
households invisible. The value of these activities has been estimated at $11 trillion. To 
provide context for their importance, official global output is estimated at $23 trillion </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>100 Jean L. Pyle 
</p>
<p>(UNDP, 1995). Feminist economists have spearheaded an effort to revise systems of na-
tional accounting to incorporate women's work in the household, giving it proper visibil-
ity and respect. They have also been increasingly urging an engendering of macroeco-
nomic policy (see for example, Bakker, 1994; Beneria, 1995; Elson, 1995; and the entire 
special issue of World Development, Nov., 1995). 
</p>
<p>The failure to include gender as a variable of analysis results in incomplete charac-
terizations of economic life and a faulty basis for constructing policies for future growth. 
Omitting women from the analysis and policy prescriptions can undermine the attain-
ment of goals, as shown directly below. 
</p>
<p>Second, in accordance with prevailing economic theory, markets are driven by con-
cerns about efficiency and profits in the short term and are not motivated to provide 
equitable opportunities or outcomes, particularly by gender. This can undermine their 
goals for profitable growth. In most areas of the world, industries deal with issues regard-
ing production, finance, and marketing, with little concern about fair relations with workers 
and income distribution in society. Workers are largely considered expendable and re-
placeable.'" Others are seen as consumers at best. In many countries increased global 
competition leads to deteriorating labor conditions, as well as environmental and health 
conditions, as deregulated markets determine the quality of life. Social conditions may 
also deteriorate in many areas as they seek to attract corporations. I have shown above 
that these trends adversely affect women in particular. 
</p>
<p>Increases in inequality generated by market-oriented economies not only violate con-
cerns of equity and fairness, but can also undermine economic growth and markets in a 
number of ways. In particular, inequality for women can undermine not only present 
growth but also future growth since women are largely in charge of providing for and 
raising the next generation. Women's contributions to economic development are handi-
capped when they have unequal access to jobs, credit, resources, markets, and the process 
of planning itself. In addition, when women do not have access to adequate health care 
and education, their capabilities as workers are impaired, as is their ability to provide an 
adequate standard of living for the next generation. This results in lowered productivity 
of future workers. Further, as inequality rises, there may be a deficiency in purchasing 
power to buy the goods and services produced, which undermines growth rates and can 
cause a contractionary cycle. In a worst case scenario, increased inequality and depriva-
tion can cause social upheavals. As stated in a Report by the World Resources Institute in 
collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations 
Development Programme (1994), 
</p>
<p>Traditional market-oriented development policies that have failed to consider equity, the environ-
</p>
<p>ment, human development, and women's roles in society are believed by a growing number of ex-
</p>
<p>perts to have contributed to poverty, an increase in economic and gender inequities, and environ-
</p>
<p>mental degradation. Such policies, by often overlooking or even undermining women's well-being 
</p>
<p>and participation in their communities, have not only hurt women but also hindered the achievement 
</p>
<p>of broad sustainable development goals. (World Resources Institute, p. 57) 
</p>
<p>Neoclassical economic theory does recognize that markets can fail in a variety of 
</p>
<p>ways, necessitating a role for government. For example, markets can fail to provide de-
</p>
<p>sired amounts of public goods, environmental protection, or education. Market-oriented 
</p>
<p>systems do not provide socially optimal outcomes in these arenas of life unless they are 
</p>
<p>'" It is only in some industrialized countries that organizations have been forced to recognize the dual roles of their 
</p>
<p>workers (in the household as well as the workplace) and the need for policies that facilitate combining these roles. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Third World Women and Global Restructuring 101 
</p>
<p>modified by state, corporate, or NGO policies. However, what this approach does not 
recognize is that the failure of markets to be concerned with equity (particularly gender 
equity, given the importance of women in the workplace and the household) as well as 
short-term efficiency will eventually undermine efficiency and growth. Efficiency and growth 
are impaired when the health and education levels of the work force are diminished; they are 
also damaged by social upheavals that can erupt as a reaction to inequality. 
</p>
<p>Third, these forms of global restructuring&mdash;the move toward more market-oriented 
economies, export-led development, the behavior of the MNCs, and the structural adjust-
ment policies&mdash;are all couched in the language of liberalization and free markets. This 
perpetuates the myth that the subsequent economic outcomes are the result of the opera-
tion of competitive markets, where everyone has similar opportunities and the role of 
government is minimal. However, there is a big difference between rhetoric and reality. 
As shown throughout Sections 3.1 to 3.4, these forms of global restructuring are based on 
deliberate interventions by government and are not "free market" strategies. All nations 
and all people do not have the same opportunities; overwhelming amounts of research 
have shown this. 
</p>
<p>The structure of the global economy is not that assumed in the traditional economic 
model in which most development economists receive training. The model of the per-
fectly competitive economy with a large number of small actors, none of whom have 
control over variables such as price, ignores the reality of powerful institutions. As out-
lined in Section 3.5, there are some major institutions acting in the global economy that 
have significant power. They have distinct goals and agendas that they seek to achieve 
using their power and resources. Gender equity is not one of them and I have shown the 
differential impact by gender of these forms of global restructuring, with the largely negative 
impact on women's lives. Although changes can occur over time (in terms of which 
country is preeminent, which corporations most influential), the existence of such a frame-
work of powerful institutions creates an environment in which it is very difficult for those 
with less power and a different set of goals (such as governments, trade unions, or NGO 
groups organizing to improve women's position) to achieve any significant gains. 
</p>
<p>In spite of the myth, these countries are not purely market-oriented, efficiency-based 
economies. Quite the contrary, policies are often expressly tailored to the advantage of 
corporations or to meet conditions of large commercial banks and attract foreign corpora-
tions. The myth remains, however, in spite of evidence to the contrary such as this quote 
from an article in Finance and Development (a journal of the WB and IMF), in which 
Arvind Panagariya (1995) says. 
</p>
<p>Successful export expansion, in turn, depends on the policy package, which conveys a message in no 
</p>
<p>uncertain terms that the country will give priority to export-oriented activities.... In efficiency 
</p>
<p>terms, virtually all policies&mdash;geographical targeting, preferential treatment of foreign investment in 
</p>
<p>general and in export sectors in particular, and discriminatory exchange retention rights&mdash;were highly 
</p>
<p>distortionary (p. 32). 
</p>
<p>In spite of the fact there are powerful actors in the global economy, there are essen-
tially no effective international bodies to globally manage macroeconomic stability (which 
I would like to redefine broadly to include employment, gender equity as well as fairness 
in general, and environmental sustainability, in addition to prices and exchange rates). 
The G-7 (United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and Canada) is 
widely considered ineffective in influencing events&mdash;even in shaping exchange rates, 
which it considers its responsibility. The extremely large flows of funds from corporate 
financial institutions are often speculative and can easily shift, as in several Asian coun-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>102 Jean L. Pyle 
</p>
<p>tries in 1997, leaving particular nations in severe economic distress. This leaves institu-
tions such as the UN (with all its difficulties in establishing policies and affecting change), 
the IMF and the WB (which work on a country-by-country basis to provide funds and 
ensure their repayment, according to strict economic policies), and a plethora of other 
organizations that have been created to advance a variety of issues&mdash;women's, labor, 
environmental, and peace. Currently, none of them have either the power or the inclina-
tion to oversee the stability of the global economy. 
</p>
<p>Not only is there no effective international institution to stabilize the world economy, 
but, with globalization, national governments have reduced control over their own mac-
roeconomic outcomes. Increasing globalization leaves countries more exposed to reces-
sions and crises than before nations were so economically interlinked. It leads to rising 
vulnerability, particularly of members of society with less power, such as women. Reces-
sions, in turn, prompt corporations to restructure further and increase their "flexibility" 
to relocate, automate, and retrench workers, which I have shown affects Third World 
women negatively. Poverty rises; inequality increases between countries; social and eco-
nomic stability can be undermined. 
</p>
<p>These three characteristics of the global economy&mdash;that markets and traditional eco-
nomic theory do not systematically include gender as a critical variable of analysis, nor 
equity as a goal, and that the language of liberalization and free markets is a myth obscuring 
domination of the global economy by powerful institutions&mdash;help perpetuate the dynamic 
wherein the effects of global restructuring on women in industry are largely negative. 
</p>
<p>5. CONCLUSIONS 
</p>
<p>The macro perspective of this chapter points out that there are several powerful global 
forces shaping women's roles that must be considered in analyses of the status of women 
and their importance to the development process and in planning for changes to improve 
their circumstances. They include: (1) the dynamics of the increasingly market-oriented 
global system; (2) the increasing adoption of export-led development strategies; (3) the 
spread and changing cost-cutting strategies of MNCs; (4) the effects of stabilization and 
structural adjustment policies (SAPs) required by the IMF and WB; and (5) inequities in 
the relative power of the major global institutions. The effect of these forces on women 
are compounded by preexisting systems of discrimination that subordinate women in the 
household, workplace (via lack of equal access to all jobs, and lack of resources for own 
businesses), political sphere, and religious institutions. This chapter has shown that there 
are analytical linkages between women's disadvantaged status and global restructuring. 
The problems that ensue for women are systemic and integral to the structure of the 
largely market-oriented international economy and the prevailing economic theories upon 
which policies for global restructuring are based. They must be addressed with this real-
ization in mind.

<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>A retrospective of the migration literature in various disciplines obscures women's par-
</p>
<p>ticipation in migration. In spite of all of the "women on the move" throughout the twen-
</p>
<p>tieth century, with few exceptions, research strategies in the same period have focused 
</p>
<p>largely on men. Initial attempts to focus on women migrants in the 1970s were met at 
</p>
<p>best with indifference, and at worst, with vitrioUc hostility. In a 1976 article commenting 
</p>
<p>on one of the first conferences on women and migration, the British urban anthropologist 
</p>
<p>Anthony Leeds opined that "the category of 'women' seems to me a rhetorical one, not 
</p>
<p>one which has (or can be proved to have) generic scientific utility" and he decried this 
</p>
<p>focus as "individualistic, reductionist, and motivational." Leeds argued that focusing, on 
</p>
<p>women would deflect attention away from structural processes of capitalist exploitation. 
</p>
<p>That in itself is telling, as it encodes the assumption that women do not act in economic 
</p>
<p>or structural contexts, that women are somehow cloistered and sheltered from capitalist 
</p>
<p>institutions. Androcentric biases, assumptions that women are "too traditional" and cul-
</p>
<p>ture bound, or that they only migrate as family followers or "associational migrants" for 
</p>
<p>family reunification, weigh heavily in the literature. 
</p>
<p>Women migrants began to receive more scholarly attention in the 1980s. The inter-

<p>national women's movement, and the subsequent growth of Women's Studies programs 
and feminist scholarship, as well as policy makers' and academics' renewed interest in 
migration, account for this turnabout. As one commentator observed of the burgeoning 
scholarship, the topic of immigration and women "has mushroomed" (Pedraza, 1991, p. 
304). After decades of neglect and absence, women were "in" in the migration literature. 
By the early 1990s, there was enough research on the topic of women and migration to 
yield two substantive, review essays in prominent sociology publications in the United 
States (Pedraza, 1991; Tienda &amp; Booth, 1991), as well as several edited volumes (e.g., 
Brettel &amp; Simon, 1986; Buijs, 1993; Chant, 1992; Gabaccia, 1992; Phizacklea, 1983; 
Schenk-Sandbergen, 1995) and numerous monographs and case studies. 
</p>
<p>In spite of the focus on women and migration, gender and migration does not re-
ceive commensurate attention. Feminist scholarship shows that gender&mdash;that is, the so-
cial and cultural ideals, displays, and practices of masculinity and femininity&mdash;organizes 
and shapes our opportunities and life chances. The concept of gender as an organizing 
principle of social life, however, has encountered resistance and indifference in immigra-
tion scholarship. This is true of research efforts in various disciplines, such as economics, 
sociology, and even in that discipline often thought to be more hospitable to feminism, 
anthropology (Stacey &amp; Thorne, 1985). 
</p>
<p>Much of the migration and immigration scholarship remains mired in an "add and 
stir" approach. Women are "added" as a variable to be inserted and measured, so that 
women's migration is examined, for example, with respect to fertility, and compared with 
men's employment patterns. Gender as a set of social relations that organize immigration 
patterns is generally ignored, and is taken into consideration only when women are the 
focus. 
</p>
<p>Some recent scholarship on gender and immigration has gone beyond just adding 
women and focuses on gender as social relations that affect and are influenced by migra-
tion (Grasmuck &amp; Pessar, 1991; Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1994; Repak, 1995). Still, many 
feminist migration scholars call for a focus on women. This is understandable given that 
the vast majority of contemporary research on immigration and migration typically omits 
women, focuses exclusively on men, and operates as though men were without gender 
(Wright, 1995). We argue that feminist immigration scholarship would best be served by 
shifting the focus from women to gender. The preoccupation with writing women into 
migration theory stifles our theorizing of how gender relations influence migration. This 
tendency is most evident in the continuing use of sex role theory to explain the patterns 
and determinants of female migration. 
</p>
<p>In this chapter we use key insights from the burgeoning body of research on women 
and migration to conceptualize gender as historically situated and socially constructed, 
contextual power relations between women and men and we seek to show how these 
relations intersect with other social institutions to influence migration. We contrast dif-
ferent approaches to the topic, juxtaposing sex role theory with a conceptualization of 
gendered labor recruitment. We then review some gendered trends in women and men's 
migration within Africa, Latin America, and Asia and from these continents to more 
industrialized nations. Although, in general, men and women have different patterns of 
movement, we caution against formulating a universal theory of difference. Finally, we 
show that gender relations not only influence migration but also change with migration 
as they intersect with other social institutions. We end by suggesting what remains to be 
done in migration theory and research to adequately conceptualize gender as a set of 
powerful, but contested and changing, social relations. </p>

<p>2. FROM SEX ROLES TO GENDER RELATIONS 
</p>
<p>2.1. The Legacy of Sex Role Theory 
</p>
<p>Much of the migration literature that addresses women's migration and immigration 
patterns remains mired in sex role theory. Sex role theory views gender as a relatively 
static attribute, not as a fluid practice (Connell, 1987; Stacey &amp; Thorne, 1985). Men's 
and women's activities are seen as complementary and functional, as serving the greater 
purpose of social cohesion. Consequently, sex role theory underemphasizes, and often 
ignores altogether, issues of power relations and social change. Finally, sex role theory 
underlines differences, rather than similarities, between women and men. 
</p>
<p>Applying this sex role framework to women and migration leads to theories empha-
sizing how domestic roles anchor women, while underlining how men's ties to the public 
sphere facilitate their movement. The general tendency for men to cross international 
borders more than women is also explained within this framework. Furthermore, this 
theoretical focus on difference, manifested in a conceptualization of stable sex roles, views 
important changes in women's migration patterns as an exception to a general trend. In 
fact, our review of some recent publications suggests that in many scholarly efforts, theo-
rizing the determinants of female migration has not moved far beyond the formulation 
proposed by Thandani and Todaro's 1984 article in which they hypothesized that the 
extent of female migration depends upon the extent of "sex-role constraint." A recent 
collection, Gender and Migration in Developing Countries (Chant, 1992), shows that 
many migration scholars still look to prescribed sex roles to explain the migration of 
women. According to Chant (1992, p. 199), "The most prominent variations in male and 
female mobility in the text appear to relate most closely to men's and women's roles in 
generating income within household units." The editor of the volume goes on to argue 
that in all nations examined in the collection, including Peru, Costa Rica, Ghana, Kenya, 
Bangladesh, Thailand, and Indonesia, men are more likely to migrate independently than 
women owing to "gender-selective mobility." This type of perspective places the focus on 
migration difference between women and men, and it implies that this difference is due to 
seemingly inevitable, unchanging, cross-cultural sex roles. 
</p>
<p>By contrast, there is a good deal of gender and migration scholarship that defies the 
concept of stable sex roles. This scholarship examines gender as relations imbued with 
power, but also sees gender relations as a fluid and mutable system that intersects with 
other social institutions. In these studies, gender forms part of the social, economic, and 
cultural constellations that constitute migration. Using this approach, we can begin to 
view gender as a set of social relations that structures migration. Through this lens, we 
can then see familiar practices and institutions, such as labor recruitment and social 
networks, as components of immigration that are fundamentally gendered. 
</p>
<p>2.2. Circular Migrant Labor and Gendered Labor Recruitment 
</p>
<p>International migration opportunities are circumscribed by transnational social networks. 
</p>
<p>Although the immigration literature underscores the importance of these social networks, 
</p>
<p>insofar as they provide important resources and connections, most of the literature either 
</p>
<p>ignores the gender-based origins and character of these networks or assumes that male-
</p>
<p>dominated immigrant networks are natural, neutral, and do not require further inquiry </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>108 Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo AND Cynthia Cranford 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Massey, Alarcon, Durand, &amp; Gonzalez, 1987). Ironically, explanations of migra-
tion patterns based on sex role theory make similar assumptions by not asking under 
what circumstances gender roles are so persistent. Gendered patterns of migration derive 
principally from gendered labor demand and recruitment, not from immutable "sex roles." 
Gendered labor recruitment, in turn, influences the formation of gender-specific net-
works. In this way, a gendered state, economy, and social sphere intersect with women 
and men's traditional "roles," often leading to changes in women's and men's activities, 
relative power, and identities. 
</p>
<p>In various historical eras, gendered patterns of labor recruitment have been used to 
secure a cheap and exploitable labor force while ensuring that the development of settle-
ment communities would not arise. This type of labor recruitment is generally circular 
and temporary but recurring. 
</p>
<p>Gendered recruitment patterns are also racialized. The group recruited for work is 
perceived as racially different and inferior, and the work is legislated along disenfran-
chised and sometimes coercive conditions. A classic example of a formal recruitment 
pattern is the United States' Bracero Program, a contract labor project designed to meet 
World War II labor shortages in western agriculture. The program remained in effect far 
beyond the end of World War II, beginning in 1942 and ending in 1964, after nearly 5 
million temporary labor contracts were issued to Mexican citizens. Virtually all of the 
bracero contracts went to men. The history of much Asian migration to the United States 
occurred along these lines as well. 
</p>
<p>What has often gone without notice is the gendered aspect of circular migrant labor 
recruitment. Circular labor migration is characterized by the physical separation of the 
costs of maintaining and renewing labor (Burawoy, 1976; Glenn, 1986). Immigrant workers 
receive the resources necessary for daily subsistence or maintenance in the country of 
destination, but the workers are reproduced, or renewed, in their countries of origin. In 
these cases women's labor is twofold. They actively support their own family's daily 
reproduction and maintenance, but they also indirectly subsidize a system of labor migra-
tion that benefits primarily urban elites, many of whom are white, with access only to 
extremely low wages. As Bonnie Thornton Dill (1988), Evelyn Nakano Glenn (1986), 
and others have pointed out, contract labor systems were organized to maximize eco-
nomic productivity, and offered few supports to sustain family life. 
</p>
<p>Labor recruitment has recently been seen as gendered because women are now ac-
tively recruited to work in low-wage jobs that have grown in industrialized nations since 
the late 1960s. One of the clearest examples is the recruitment of women from Asia and 
Latin America to work as nannies and housekeepers in the United States, Britain, Canada, 
Europe, and increasingly in the Middle East (Constable, 1997; Repak, 1995). Repak 
(1994) coined the term "gendered labor recruitment" to describe the initial migration of 
Central American women to Washington, D.C. in the 1960s and 1970s. Diplomats, who 
spent a term of duty in Central America, resettled in Washington, D.C. and informally 
recruited Central American women to work as nannies and housekeepers in D.C. Gen-
der-specific labor recruitment can also be formally implemented, as in the cases of South 
Asian and Filipina migration to the Middle East (Helens, Schampers, &amp; Speckmann, 
1992; Tyner, 1996). Gender-specific migration and recruitment does not follow from 
immutable sex roles. Rather, gendered patterns of migration emerge from the intersection 
of traditional gender relations and social, economic, and political changes. It is to these 
historicized patterns of migration that we now turn. </p>

<p>3. GENDERED PATTERNS OF MIGRATION 
</p>
<p>In this section we describe gendered patterns of migration within Africa, Asia, and Latin 
America as well as migration from these nations to more industrialized nations. We focus 
on how the social relations of gender intersect with other institutions to produce gendered 
recruitment and gendered networks, showing that gender is a set of fluid social relations 
rather than stable sex roles. 
</p>
<p>3.1. Africa 
</p>
<p>It is only fairly recently, in the late twentieth century, that women have been participat-
ing in labor migration in Africa. Men had traditionally predominated in rural-urban 
migration because men were vigorously recruited for work in plantations, railroads, mines, 
and even as domestic servants (Moodie, 1994). Under racial apartheid in South Africa, 
the men lived in the city of destination only while employed, and when not employed they 
returned to their rural or village place of origin. This system was not uncommon else-
where in the continent. 
</p>
<p>Although African women themselves were not on the move, they played a key role 
in maintaining this system. The male migrant workers received the resources necessary 
for daily subsistence or maintenance in the city of destination, but these same workers 
were "renewed" in their place of origin, with the women taking on the responsibility for 
intensive, small-scale, subsistence farming. The women "left behind" also traded, en-
gaged in petty commodity production, and became effective heads-of-households. 
</p>
<p>African women stayed behind not only because of their traditional "roles" in the 
household and in agriculture, but also because in many nations employers and govern-
ment authorities deliberately kept women and children in rural hinterland areas so as to avoid 
the creation of permanent, black communities in white areas (Stichter, 1985; Tienda &amp; Booth, 
1991). In short, women's traditional responsibility to care for children and the home inter-
sected with systems of racial oppression and explicit policies to ensure racial segregation. 
</p>
<p>The coercive migrant system in South Africa is a stark example of the mutability of 
traditional gender "roles" under certain conditions. It is rare that men are conceptualized 
as gendered beings, yet Moodie's (1994) historical study of the South African mines, 
beginning in the late nineteenth century, showed that men in the mines took on tradition-
ally female activities such as sewing, crocheting, and making beer. Not all men did this 
"women's work," but the men created an alternative system of hierarchy that drew on the 
social relations of gender. Younger men often became the "wives" of older men who 
would give them gifts and money in return for domestic chores and sexual pleasure. The 
age hierarchy in many African cultures was central to gendered relations between the 
men. Older men could not be wives, although they might have served as wives in their 
youth. The young men eventually transitioned out of these oppressive relationships. In 
this manner, they did not threaten the relationship between the older man and his family 
back in the country. In addition, this system of relationships between men was seen as 
safer than relations with the few city women, who at that time were overwhelmingly 
prostitutes, because it prevented pregnancy. 
</p>
<p>Since the 1960s, women have increased and men have decreased their participation 
in rural-urban migration flows in Africa (Gugler, 1989; Stichter, 1985; Tienda &amp; Booth, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>110 Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo AND Cynthia Cranford 
</p>
<p>1991). Most of these new female migrants are married women who are joining husbands 
in cities, but increasingly more unmarried women are also migrating (Stichter, 1985; 
Wilkinson, 1987). In the second half of the twentieth century, a growing number of women 
have migrated to West African towns and cities (Wilkinson, 1987), and one can now find 
settled communities around the South African mines as women's traditional farming 
activities are displaced by capitalist penetration into the rural hinterlands (Moodie, 1994). 
South African women did not merely follow their husbands to the cities, however. Their 
move was also structured by changes in the local political economy. For example, Pondo 
women now commonly migrate to escape unhappy marriages and husbands who do not 
support their children (Buijs, 1993; Oboo, 1980). 
</p>
<p>Although African women are now more likely to migrate to cities than before, men 
still predominate in international migration from African nations. Accordingly, there is 
not much literature on African women and international migration. Nonetheless, West 
African women are now recruited for paid domestic work in Italy. In Italy, however, 
African men, who work in construction and other public occupations, are the targets of 
growing anti-immigrant sentiment. Many Italians believe African immigrant men are 
taking their jobs, yet in contrast, African women are not in the public mind because they 
are "invisibly" employed in households and because they allow Italian middle-class fami-
lies to run smoothly as both husband and wife are in the paid labor force. However, there 
is some evidence that Italians prefer lighter skinned Filipinas over West African women 
as paid domestic workers (Andall, 1992). In addition, upper-class Somali women, fleeing 
the civil war, now migrate to Britain with their families. In Britain, Somali immigrant 
women work as housekeepers and nannies and in the factories, while most Somali men 
are unemployed because it is seen as unmanly for an upper-class Somali man to do such 
work (Summerfield, 1993). Somali women's employment and men's unemployment in 
Britain are examples of how gender and class intersect to create a preference for immi-
grant women in the growing low-wage service and factory jobs in industrialized nations. 
</p>
<p>In this section we used the literature to show that male-dominated migration streams 
within Africa were gendered by the political and economic policies of nations, such as the 
racial apartheid system that prevailed in South Africa. Historicizing and conceptualizing 
male-dominated migration streams allows us to recognize the recent migration of Afri-
can women as paid domestic workers to European nations, for example, as a new form of 
gendered migration, one that has come about with globalization. 
</p>
<p>We wish to underline that gendered migration patterns in the African continent 
differ from those in other developing nations. Unlike the African continent, in Asia, 
Latin America, and the Caribbean, most migrants to the city are women. This difference 
between the migration patterns of African, Latin American, and Asian women should 
warn against a universal theory of sex role constraint. 
</p>
<p>3.2. Asia and the Middle East 
</p>
<p>Asia's position in the global economy as a site for multinational corporations' manufac-
</p>
<p>turing and assembly activities, and as a major location of U.S. military bases, has spurred 
</p>
<p>migration within Asian nations (Ong, 1987; Sturdevant &amp; Stoltzfus, 1992; Wolf, 1990). 
</p>
<p>These developments are largely responsible for attracting primarily Asian women, not 
</p>
<p>men, to the cities, because assembly work is low paid and because the tedious nature of 
</p>
<p>assembly work is seen as more fit for women than for men. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Migration 111 
</p>
<p>Research conducted by Diane Wolf (1990) in Java and by Aihwa Ong (1987) in 
Malaysia examined the experiences of young, single women who migrated from rural 
areas to work in the new export processing zones. In Malaysia, the combination of declin-
ing peasant farming and the introduction of Japanese manufacturing assembly plants has 
induced the rural-urban migration and proletarianization of young, single women. The 
emergence of export-oriented textile and electronics industries in Thailand has also spurred 
the migration of young women to the cities (Singhanetra-Renard &amp; Prabhudhanitisarn, 
1992). In the Philippines, women from the rural provinces migrate to cities, and many of 
them are employed as domestic workers and prostitutes in areas around U.S. military 
bases. Although prostitution is illegal in the Philippines, women sell sexual labor as 
"hospitality women" in bars, massage parlors and night clubs. The migrant women who 
engage in this activity, are routinely abused economically, sexually, and physically. 
</p>
<p>Although in general, Asian women predominate in rural-urban migration, we see 
different patterns in the South Asian nations of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri 
Lanka. In South Asia men outnumber women in the cities, owing to patterns of land 
tenure and agriculture (Pedraza, 1991, p. 310). The South Asian case, however, should 
not be seen as an exception to a general rule of female predominance in rural-urban 
migration in Asia. Instead, the case of South Asia indicates how the local political economy 
(i.e., land tenure and agriculture) intersects with gender relations to produce gender-
specific migration streams, much as it did in South Africa to spur the migration of women 
to the cities. 
</p>
<p>International migration from South Asian nations such as India and Pakistan has 
been structured by past colonial relations with Britain. During the colonial period, Brit-
ain encouraged the migration of Indians and Pakistanis to become the merchants in Brit-
ish colonies in East Africa. Indian and Pakistani women migrated with their families to 
Kenya and Uganda. The first waves of Indian migration to Britain began with individual 
male migrant laborers, but over time women came and permanent settlement communi-
ties were formed (Clarke, Peach, &amp; Vertovec, 1990). In addition many Indian and Paki-
stani women and men left East Africa for Britain, leading Bhachu (1995) to call them 
"twice migrants." 
</p>
<p>Today large numbers of Indians and Pakistanis have settled in Britain. Pakistani 
women and girls under purdah&mdash;the Islamic custom of female separation from unrelated 
males&mdash;work in their home sewing for local garment manufacturers. Yet these women 
are not isolated in their homes. Their informal networks with other Pakistani women give 
them some semblance of power as they discuss the going piece rate and make friendships 
that help buttress the hostility of white British society (Werbner, 1988). Westwood's (1988) 
study of Gujarati women in Britain showed that women benefited from female networks 
on the shop floor as well. These women garment workers were often kin, as women 
helped sisters and daughters get jobs. The women used their close ties to slow production 
to stabilize the piece rate, to challenge the white male dominated union, and to create a 
more hospitable environment at work with celebrations surrounding birthdays, weddings,

<p>Asian women have a long history of migrating to the United States, and although 
Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Filipina women have predominated in recent decades, 
only Chinese and Japanese women predominated in the past. Chinese and Japanese women 
began coming to the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, 
respectively, but their migration was hindered by deliberate U.S. policies of racial exclu-
sion. </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Chinatowns were largely "bach-
elor" communities, and immigrant daughters from poor, peasant families in China sup-
plied sexual labor in cities such as San Francisco, where there were few women (Cheng, 
1979). These young women were usually sold by poor families, and daughters accepted 
their sale and subsequent migration out of filial loyalty. Chinese patriarchal ideology 
forbade the migration of "decent" women, and U.S. policies also prevented the migration 
of all Chinese after 1882. According to Cheng, the experiences of these young migrant 
women were not homogeneous, as prostitution was organized in different ways. Some of 
the women gained autonomy and control over their lives, while others were virtual slaves. 
</p>
<p>The migration of Japanese women was distinct for each generation. In Issei, Nisei, 
War Bride (1986), Evelyn Nakano Glenn examined the migration and domestic work 
experiences of three generations of Japanese women in the San Francisco Bay Area. The 
first generation of Japanese women began arriving in the early twentieth century, rapidly 
transforming the ratio of Japanese men to women from 25:1 at the turn of the century, to 
2:1 by 1924. Many of these women were "picture brides," and once in the United States, 
they worked triple shifts doing their own housework, working in family farms and busi-
nesses, and also as paid domestic workers. The 1924 Immigration Act excluded all im-
migration from Asian countries, effectively curtailing the growth of Asian-American 
communities in the United States. Although the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act established 
token immigration quotas, it was only the 1965 amendment to the immigration act that 
allowed more Asians to immigrate to the United States. 
</p>
<p>More recently Korean, Vietnamese, Filipina, and South Asian and Middle Eastern 
women have migrated to the United States. In recent years many educated Filipinas were 
recruited to the United States to fill nursing shortages in hospitals and nursing homes 
(Ong &amp; Azores, 1994; Pido, 1992). Yet they were generally placed in the lowest paid 
nursing jobs, often in inner city county hospitals where the case loads are the highest 
(Ong &amp; Azores, 1994). Iranian women came to the United States as exiles in the early 
1980s, fleeing the fundamentalist revolution against the Shah, while Vietnamese women 
came with their families as refugees after the Vietnam War (Nacify, 1993; Ong, Bonacich, 
&amp; Cheng, 1994). Korean immigration was facilitated by the presence of U.S. military 
bases in South Korea and women generally migrated with their families, settling prima-
rily in Los Angeles and New York (Ong, Bonacich, &amp; Cheng, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Recent migration streams of Filipina, Sri Lankan, and Indian women to the Middle 
East, where they are recruited as contracted domestic workers, offer stark examples of the 
mutability of traditional gender roles in changing political and economic contexts. The 
migration of Muslim Sri Lankan women to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states is in sharp 
contrast to explanations of migration patterns based on a theory of sex roles. Until very 
recently, Sri Lankan women took care of the family and household chores and Sri Lankan 
men were the sole breadwinners. This has changed with the increasing poverty among 
Sri Lankan households, and rapid economic growth of Middle Eastern nations. Although 
there is very high unemployment among Sri Lankan men, it is the women who migrate to 
the Middle East owing to the gender-specific demand for domestic workers, which is 
activated by gendered recruitment. The demand for male migrant construction workers 
has slowed, with the completion of the basic physical infrastructure of these economies, 
but the demand for live-in housekeepers and nannies has not subsided. A tightly con-
trolled, government-run recruitment program ensures this system of gendered migration 
and immigrant labor. For example, in Saudi Arabia it is more expensive for Sri Lankan </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Migration 113 
</p>
<p>men to obtain work permits than it is for Sri Lankan women (Helens &amp; Speckmann, 
1992). 
</p>
<p>Gendered labor recruitment also funnels the migration of Filipina domestic workers 
to the Middle Eastern nations of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and to other Asian nations 
such as Singapore and Hong Kong (Tyner, 1996). Although most studies focus on the 
deployment of workers, Tyner's research focuses on the first two stages of the recruitment 
process, contract procurement and labor recruitment. The contract procurement stage 
consists of negotiations with the labor-importing nation that is seeking a low-paid labor 
force. The labor-importing nations have the upper hand in this current environment of 
labor surplus. Meanwhile, the Philippines competes with other nations, such as Indone-
sia and Pakistan, to represent its workers as the most docile and hardworking migrants. 
At this stage, gendered assumptions that women are homemakers, mistresses, or mothers 
are used to portray women in a range of occupations&mdash;from domestic workers to nurses to 
entertainment workers&mdash;that provide physical comfort. In contrast, men are portrayed in 
professional or construction occupations (Tyner, 1996, p. 411). The recruitment phase 
takes place in the Philippines as private and government recruiters try to match workers 
to specific contracts. In this phase, recruitment of women performing artists is often the 
focus because the explicitly sexualized demand is great and the payoff is larger. The 
selection of geographical areas from which to recruit women is also gendered and fueled 
by sexualized stereotypes and images that rural women are more adept at domestic skills, 
are more docile, and that women who frequent nightclubs are more difficult to control 
(Tyner, 1996, p. 413). In sum, Tyner argues that migrant women are essentially bought 
and sold as government and private recruiters employ these gendered representations in 
the labor recruitment process. 
</p>
<p>In contrast to the government-sponsored recruitment patterns that characterize the 
international migration of Asian women, most Latin American women's migration is 
facilitated by well-established networks. In Latin America and the Caribbean, as in Asia, 
women predominate in rural to urban migration, which increasingly corresponds to pat-
terns of investment by multinational corporations. 
</p>
<p>3.3. Latin America and the Caribbean 
</p>
<p>Since the colonial period, young women have migrated from Latin American rural com-
</p>
<p>munities to cities for jobs as domestic workers in private households. In the second half of 
</p>
<p>the twentieth century, Latin America urbanization accelerated and young, single women 
</p>
<p>have predominated in rural-urban migration. Many of these young, single women came 
</p>
<p>from poor, peasant families and they were drawn to work as domestic servants in Latin 
</p>
<p>American cities. Their migration served as a "demographic safety valve" for rural com-
</p>
<p>munities that could not absorb the labor of these women (Tienda &amp; Booth, 1992, p. 63). 
</p>
<p>In the late twentieth century, as live-out working arrangements became more common, 
</p>
<p>domestic work relations became more contractual and less personal. Alternatively, new 
</p>
<p>urban jobs in retail and services also drew migrant women into the competitive sector. 
</p>
<p>For poor, relatively unschooled women from the countryside, domestic work still pro-
</p>
<p>vides one of the few means of economic survival and urban exposure, but it does not 
</p>
<p>necessarily provide a stepladder to better jobs. Migrant women who are able to leave 
</p>
<p>domestic service do so because they marry and become homemakers, or because they </p>

</p>
<p>make a lateral socioeconomic move to informal sector vending (Chaney &amp; Garcia Castro, 
1989). 
</p>
<p>The general tendency for Latin American women to migrate to the cities while men 
migrate abroad is the result of specific historical conditions. Lourdes Arizpe (1981) made 
precisely this point with respect to Mexican internal migration. The pioneer stage of 
rural-urban migration in Mexico in the 1940s and 1950s was made up of young people 
with some secondary or prepatory level education who migrated to the cities to find pro-
fessional jobs and a modern life (Arizpe, 1981, p. 636). Twenty years later, peasants 
began to migrate for survival as the proliferation of manufactured products into the rural 
areas encouraged greater dependency on wages. Both young men and young women mi-
grated to the cities during this period, but women's traditional income-generating activi-
ties&mdash;weaving, sewing, pottery-making, and petty trade&mdash;declined drastically, making it 
nearly impossible for single women to survive in rural areas. This fueled their migration 
to cities. 
</p>
<p>Male migration to the United States has also accelerated women's migration and 
employment within Mexico. Meager remittances and the prolonged absences of migrant 
husbands often propelled women to migrate to cities and villages for jobs in agricultural 
occupations previously defined as male, in service sectors jobs, and in newly created 
occupations where labor is exclusively or primarily female, such as jobs in packinghouses; 
maquiladoras; in shoe, clothing, and textile manufacturing; and in homework assembly 
(Beneria &amp; Roldan, 1987). 
</p>
<p>Since the mid-1960s, women in Mexico and the Caribbean have also been drawn to 
cities to work in export assembly production (Fernandez-Kelly, 1983; Nash, 1983; Tiano, 
1994). As in Asian nations, particular patterns of industrialization along the United States-
Mexico border and in the Caribbean have stimulated women's rural-urban migration. In 
1965, in an effort to stave off rising unemployment the Mexican government instituted 
the Border Industrialization Program (BIP), a program designed to generate the infra-
structure and legal conditions necessary to attract successfully foreign manufacturing 
investment along the northern border with the United States. Although the BIP was origi-
nally intended to employ male migrant workers, the plants employed predominantly young, 
single women because of employer preferences and the growing population of single 
women without the financial support of husbands or fathers. During the 1970s, women 
accounted for 75% to 90% of the border plant assembly workers, and many of them were 
young, single, childless women drawn from the interior of Mexico (Fernandez-Kelly, 
1983). 
</p>
<p>Whereas in the 1960s and 1970s it was primarily single women who migrated and 
sought wage work in Mexico, with the economic crisis of the 1980s, financial need pro-
pelled married women with small children into the labor force. Many of these women 
were former migrants to the city (Escobar &amp; Gonzalez de la Rocha, 1988; de Oliveiria, 
1990). Many types of unregulated, informal sector work, for example, vending or doing 
assembly in the home, allow married women to still assume child-rearing and domestic 
responsibilities in the home. Insights into these processes led Escobar, Gonzalez de la 
Rocha, and Roberts (1987) to argue that women with children were more likely to mi-
grate to Guadalajara than to the United States because they could perform outwork for 
pay and still care for their children. In short, the specific demand for women in the 
maquiladoras and the proliferation of informal sector work generated by larger political 
and economic changes have intersected with household gender relations to structure 
women's migration to the cities. </p>
<p/>

<p>Gender and Migration 115 
</p>
<p>Latin American women of various nationalities, but especially Mexican, Cuban, 
Dominican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan, have also migrated to the United States and 
many of them find work as paid domestic workers, as factory workers, and in retail. 
Puerto Rican women's migration to the U.S. mainland, particularly to the East Coast, is 
intimately tied to U.S. patterns of investment in Puerto Rico (Toro-Morn, 1995). Yet in 
the mainstream immigration literature the migration of women is only briefly mentioned 
and rarely taken as the starting point of analysis. 
</p>
<p>The tendency to minimize the size and importance of women international migrants 
is clear in the case of Mexican migration to the United States. Although historical stud-
ies, like Vicki Ruiz's (1987) on the California canneries, show that Mexican women and 
children migrated in the early decades of this century, much of the literature character-
izes Mexican migration as circular, temporary, male-dominated migration. These gener-
alizations come from a particular historical period of migration, however, namely that 
characterized by the Bracero Program from 1942 to 1965 and to a lesser extent by the 
earlier contract labor program during World War I. This gender-discriminate labor policy 
mandated an elastic supply of labor, one that could be synchronized with seasonal agri-
cultural fluctuations and that would externalize labor reproduction costs to Mexico. 
</p>
<p>The Bracero Program provided the legislative foundation for the strength of men's 
social migrant networks. Hondagneu-Sotelo (1994) found that these male networks were 
not automatically extended to wives or other female kin. Instead, wives had to struggle 
with their husbands, and daughters with their fathers, before they could migrate. Eventu-
ally, women's migrant networks developed that allowed women to migrate to Cahfornia 
without the approval of male kin, but with the help of an aunt or a sister already in the 
United States. Recent research suggests that migration networks among Puerto Ricans 
have also been gendered. Ellis, Conway, and Bailey (1996) found that migration deci-
sions were made in contexts where women and men have different access to resources, 
such as networks and money, to pay for recruitment agencies and for the move itself. 
</p>
<p>The development of female networks facilitated the formation of permanent settle-
ment communities (Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1994). Thus, while Mexican women with chil-
dren might be more likely to migrate to Mexican cities than to the United States (Escobar 
et al., 1987), it is well known that Mexican women have also migrated with their children 
to California, Texas, and other U.S. states. 
</p>
<p>A less well-known pattern of migration involves the solo migration of women who 
are mothers of young children. Increasingly, many Mexican and Central American women 
are migrating to work in the United States while leaving their children in their countries 
of origin, in the care of grandmothers, other female kin, the children's fathers, or some-
times with paid caregivers. In a recent article, Hondagneu-Sotelo and Avila (1997) refer 
to this pattern as "Latina transnational motherhood." In some cases, the separations of 
time and distance are substantial; ten years may elapse before women are reunited with 
their children. While transnational mothering has numerous historical precursors, most 
of them involve the migration of men away from their children, although the separation 
of mothers and children during slavery, and the legacy of Caribbean and African-Ameri-
can women from the South leaving their children "back home" to seek work in the U.S. 
North are important precursors. When men come North and leave their families in Mexico, 
as they did during the Bracero Program and as many continue to do today, they are fulfill-
ing familial obligations defined as breadwinning for the family. When Mexican and Cen-
tral American women do so, they are embarking not only on an immigration journey, but 
on a more radical, gender-transformative odyssey. As they initiate separations of space </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>116 Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo AND Cynthia Cranford 
</p>
<p>and time from their communities of origin, they must cope with stigma, guilt, and criti-
cism from others. The jobs that many of these women perform in paid domestic work are 
not often compatible with the daily care for one's own family. In this way, contemporary 
transnational motherhood continues a long legacy of people of color being incorporated 
into the United States through coercive systems of labor that do not recognize family 
rights. The job characteristics of paid domestic work, especially live-in work, virtually 
impose transnational motherhood for many Mexican and Central American women who 
have children of their own (Hondagneu-Sotelo &amp; Avila, 1997). 
</p>
<p>A study of Central American migration to Washington, D.C. provides another ex-
ample of gendered labor recruitment and gender-based social networks, in this case prin-
cipally constituted by women. In this study, Terry Repak (1995) found that Central Ameri-
can housekeepers were initially informally recruited to Washington, D.C. during the 1960s 
and 1970s by diplomatic and professional families returning home after a tour of duty in 
Central America. In this instance, the regional structural conditions in Washington, D.C, 
particularly the labor demand for nannies and housekeepers, proved to be more condu-
cive to women's than to men's migration. Occupational sex segregation in U.S. labor 
markets played a large part in shaping gendered patterns of labor migration. At the point 
of origin, the relatively low marriage rates also facilitated women's ability to migrate. 
While a vanguard of Central American women immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s laid 
the foundations of social networks, over time these networks diversified and facilitated 
men's migration and the emergence of permanent Central American communities in 
Washington, D.C. 
</p>
<p>Yet another study of Central American migrants to the United States sheds light on 
the gendered nature of social networks and the gendered outcomes of legalization offered 
by the Immigration Reform and Control Act. In a study of the Maya who have settled in 
Houston, Texas, sociologist Jacqueline Hagan (1994) found that the Mayan men were 
better able than the women to develop social networks. This is not due to traditional sex 
roles nor any cultural predilection on the part of the Maya. This pattern emerges, Hagan 
argues, due to occupational segregation by sex in the United States and specifically in 
Houston. In Houston, virtually all of the Mayan men worked as maintenance or stock 
workers for a big supermarket chain and the women as live-in domestic workers. Hagan 
argues that because of the men's well-developed job-finding networks, newly arrived 
Maya men were able to locate jobs faster than the newcomer women, who each waited to 
find a new, separate employer. The isolation the women encountered in their live-in jobs 
seemed to work against the fortification and multiplication of their own social networks. 
</p>
<p>The Houston study also shows the gendered repercussions of these networks. Hagan 
explains that the women, because of their less developed information networks, were less 
successful than the men in obtaining legalization through the Immigration Reform and 
Control Act. The women were also hindered, Hagan notes, by their reliance on domestic 
employers, who were often reluctant to sign affidavits for fear that they would be ha-
rangued by the IRS for not paying employment taxes. 
</p>
<p>Migration of political refugees is another example that defies the facile generaliza-
tion that Latin American men migrate abroad while women migrate to the cities. Politi-
cal refugees generally come as families and plan to settle permanently. In Chile, the 1973 
military coup and overthrow of the democratically elected, socialist president, and the 
repressive aftermath forced many trade unionists, activists, and leftists to leave for Eu-
rope, Mexico, Canada, and the United States. Cuban women who came to Miami with 
their families fleeing Fidel Castro's regime derived primarily from the middle and upper </p>
<p/>

<p>Gender and Migration 117 
</p>
<p>classes. Familiar explanations for the Cubans' success in Miami emphasized the class 
privileges and human capital that they brought with them, and the politically motivated 
actions of the U.S. government in offering substantial resettlement assistance to those 
fleeing communism. Cuban women also played an important part in building Cuban 
economic success in the United States (Fernandez-Kelly &amp; Garcia, 1990). 
</p>
<p>In this section we have given an overview of the general patterns of migration within 
Africa, Asia, and Latin America and migration from these nations to the United States 
and other more industrialized nations. For internal migration we have shown that, rather 
than immutable gender roles, local economic and political conditions interact with a 
traditional gender division of labor in the home to produce women's and men's migration 
patterns. For international migration streams we have shown the ways in which gendered 
recruitment patterns and the formation of gender-specific networks have led to the pre-
dominance of men in international migration during particular historical moments. Yet 
as changes in the economies of industrialized nations lead to demand for domestic ser-
vants, garment workers, and other gendered occupations, we see increasing female-spe-
cific recruitment and networks (Sassen-Koob, 1984). Thus, labor migration is gendered 
at the macro level of labor demand as well as the micro level of gendered networks. As 
Ellis et al., (1996) show in the case of Puerto Rican migration, restructuring incorporates 
women and men into industrialized economies differently, drawing on patriarchy as much 
as capitalism. In the next section we continue to challenge a view of gender as stable roles 
by showing that gender relations are not only determinants of migration but are also 
influenced by migration. 
</p>
<p>4. CHANGING GENDER RELATIONS WITH MIGRATION 
</p>
<p>In 1970, in her pioneering work Women's Role in Economic Development, Esther Boserup 
argued that women's status declines with industrialization and migration. Since then, 
scholars of migration and gender have moved beyond debating whether women benefit or 
lose with migration and toward understanding the contradictions in women's status that 
come with migration. In this section we show that with migration, women often gain 
status in some realms while losing it in others. Even if women's power increases and 
men's decreases, as is often the case with international migration where racial oppression 
is a factor, men generally still benefit from their status as men. 
</p>
<p>4.1. Women Who Stay Behind: Beyond a Static Portrayal 
</p>
<p>Explanations of migration patterns rarely take as a starting point the experience of the 
</p>
<p>women who stay behind. Are we to assume that because they stayed behind they are 
</p>
<p>inevitably tied to the singular role of housekeeping and childcare? What kinds of new 
</p>
<p>activities do they take on with the departure of their husbands, fathers, and brothers? In 
</p>
<p>this section we use case studies from Mexico and the Dominican Republic to conceptual-
</p>
<p>ize how migration influences gender relations in the sending communities. 
</p>
<p>In regions of Mexico marked by United States-bound male migration, patriarchal 
</p>
<p>gender relations that structure women's work experience have shown receptiveness to 
</p>
<p>change. Gail Mummert's (1988) research examined the rural villages surrounding Zamora, 
</p>
<p>Michoacan, where young, single women's recent employment in commercial agriculture. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>118 Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo AND Cynthia Cranford 
</p>
<p>in conjunction with male wage labor in the United States, has brought about rapid and 
significant changes in gender relations. Initially, local and regional employers' recruit-
ment efforts obtained parental permission by assuring parents that their daughters would 
be properly chaperoned. Today this is no longer the case. Female employment has shifted 
from being a stigmatized rarity to a virtual rite of passage, an expectation for all young, 
single women, and an alternative to household drudgery and isolation. Today, young 
women are no longer cloistered in the home, but walk about with their friends, with 
whom they take buses outside the village to the fields and packinghouses. While the first 
generation of female workers turned over their entire earnings to their parents, young 
women now either keep all of it or contribute only part of their paychecks to their families 
and spend the rest as they please, usually on clothes and cosmetics. Even when working 
daughters compliantly turn over their salary to parents, young women have acquired 
more decision-making power in the domestic arena. Courting patterns are more open, 
and in less than two decades there has been a shift away from patrilocality to matrilocal-
ity or neolocality, as mothers and daughters pool their earnings to purchase the new 
couple land, and thus avoid the subordination a newly married daughter suffers when 
living with parents-in-law. 
</p>
<p>It would be misleading to overstate these transformations in domestic patriarchy. 
Although women may "take the reins" during men's long-term absences by making deci-
sions, securing employment, and venturing beyond the domestic sphere, their behavior 
often remains subject to strong double standards. Sexual infidelity, for example, may be 
tolerated in a man, who is allowed to maintain a casa chica with a second woman and 
children, but a women left alone by her sojourning husband is often under the watchful 
eyes of other villagers, and any contact with an unrelated man may be cause for suspicion. 
Yet young women's acceptance of these double standards may be eroding. Georgina 
Rosado's research suggests that in the context of men's migration northward, women's 
beliefs about traditional double standards of sexuality are weakening. One of the young, 
single working women that Rosado interviewed in a rural, migratory village of Michoacan, 
discussed the issue of spousal sexual infidelity with her friends and her mother, and then 
concluded, "I don't believe as my mother does that you must put up with your husband 
forever if he cheats and turns outs bad" (Rosado, 1990, p. 67). 
</p>
<p>The migration of men and the remittances they send can also influence the status of 
women back home. Mascarenhas-Keyes' (1993) study on India showed the complex 
changes that can occur with men's migration. Lower caste Catholic women once pro-
vided domestic and farm labor for upper caste Catholics. With the remittances from their 
husbands, however, lower caste Catholic women now hire migrant Hindu women as do-
mestics. Lower caste Catholic women have redefined themselves as no longer fit to do 
housework or farmwork, while Hindu migrant women have redefined themselves as mar-
ketable employees and have so gained both new independence and subordination. This is 
a stark example of the intersection of gender, class, and ethnicity, manifested in the se-
verely unequal relations between two groups of women, Catholic employers and Hindu 
domestic workers. 
</p>
<p>Increased autonomy and power in men's absence often gives women the power to 
negotiate their own migration with their husbands and other male kin. This is a clear 
example of how gender is not made up of stable roles but of contested power relations. 
Recent research has looked at Mexican women who eventually migrate to the United 
States to join their husbands (Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1994). Although there were structural </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Migration 119 
</p>
<p>inducements to this pattern of migration, it was men's authority within families and 
men's access to migrant network resources that favored the husbands' initial departure. 
Yet their departure rearranged gender relations in the family; as women assumed new 
tasks and responsibilities, they learned to act more assertively and autonomously. This 
new sense of social power, and later, for another cohort of migrant wives, additional 
access to women's network resources, enabled the wives to migrate to the United States. 
</p>
<p>In many ways this study echoes the findings of Sherrie Grasmuck and Patricia Pessar 
(1991), who found similar dynamics among Dominican women who initially stayed be-
hind when their husbands migrated to New York. Like the case of Mexican women, 
Dominican women actively negotiated their migration with their husbands. One Domini-
can woman convinced her husband to let her migrate by arguing that she could not sur-
vive economically back home. Yet she really wanted to migrate because a friend told her 
that her husband would not be able to push her around in New York. Thus a focus on 
gender relations also shows that migrants are not always motivated by economic gains, as 
is still assumed in much of the mainstream immigration literature. 
</p>
<p>These case studies show that migration of male kin can induce change in gender 
relations, often leading to the eventual migration of the women. More research should be 
done on women who stay behind, as well as on the struggles between women and men 
that lead to the eventual migration of women. In the next section we examine the more 
common question of what happens to gender relations when women move. 
</p>
<p>4.2. Women Who Migrate to the Cities 
</p>
<p>Although staying "back home" and assuming a myriad of economic and family responsi-
bilities has been a struggle for women, it has traditionally afforded them some semblance 
of autonomy and independence. What happens when they migrate to cities? In a study of 
migrant women in Lesotho, Wilkinson (1987) found that migration did not enhance, but 
rather diminished women's position vis-a-vis men. As young women have acquired edu-
cation, many have aspired to clerical, industrial, or technical jobs, but more often than 
not they do not find the jobs they seek. In the city, women work commonly as vendors, as 
commodity producers, and as prostitutes. In this context, migrating to the city increased 
women's dependence on men and intensified their subordination (Wilkinson, 1987). In 
the city of Maseru, Wilkinson found that women's only job opportunities were in the 
informal sector, while migrant men took jobs in the formal sector or the public sector. 
Even when migrant women have better employment opportunities and increased incomes, 
their relative economic position does not necessarily improve dramatically, as they often 
remain dependent on men to purchase their goods. 
</p>
<p>In a review of various case studies of women and migration in several African na-
tions, Tienda and Booth (1991, p. 60) noted that the impact of migration often depends 
on whether a woman is married or single at the time of migration: 
</p>
<p>For women who moved with or to join husbands, migration transferred male control over women's 
</p>
<p>labour and earnings from rural to urban areas, adapting hierarchical relations to an urban setting. .. (so 
</p>
<p>that) wives in poor families were unable to challenge the patriarchal relations of redistribution. . . By 
</p>
<p>contrast, single women were able to improve their social position by increasing their autonomy via 
</p>
<p>economic exchanges. For them the city provides the only alternative to assured subordination in the 
</p>

</p>
<p>Women who were married at the time of migration experienced more limited autonomy 
than single women in the city. Married women often lost much of the independence and 
control that they maintained over their own households "back home." 
</p>
<p>Ong's (1987) study of young, single, "neophyte factory women" who migrate to 
work in the Malaysian export processing zones showed that they did gain some autonomy 
because they married later than their nonmigrant peers. Moreover, although they earned 
low wages, they typically contributed about half of their earnings to their family of origin, 
thus gaining greater power in the family. These transformations, however, were not with-
out their contradictions, as the women suffered hallucinations and "spirit attacks" on the 
shop floor, which Ong interpreted as a challenge to capitalist discipline and the male 
authority imposed on them in the factories. 
</p>
<p>In contrast, Wolf's (1990) study of Javanese migrant women suggests that it is not 
just earning power that brings autonomy and independence. Wolf found that the earnings 
of young, migrant women working in assembly factories are so low that the women work-
ers are subsidized by their own families in rural Java. She concluded that the peasant 
economy is in fact subsidizing the factories. The young women contributed very little 
money to their families because they had to spend much of their earnings for transporta-
tion and lunch expenses. While their earnings were very modest, the young women de-
rived satisfaction and status from their employment, and they used the modest remain-
ders of their income to purchase cosmetics and other small consumer goods and to save 
for a dowry. Wolf (1990) reported that many of these women: 
</p>
<p>exhibited an air of assertiveness compared with their peers who had never worked in a factory. Their 
</p>
<p>makeup, nail polish, and in a few cases long pants were statements of modernity. .. Many stated 
</p>
<p>defiantly that they, not their parents, would choose their future mate. (p. 42). 
</p>
<p>Like Indonesia and Malaysia, Mexico has opened export processing zones that pre-
fer the labor of migrant women. Research conducted by Fernandez-Kelly (1983) and 
Susan Tiano (1994) in the maquiladora assembly plants revealed that the employment of 
migrant daughters, wives, and mothers neither eroded domestic patriarchy nor enhanced 
women's positions in families. Husbands and fathers, when present, still maintained family 
authority, and employed women still took primary responsibility for domestic household 
chores (Fernandez-Kelly, 1983). As in the United States, women in Mexico earned sig-
nificantly less than did men, and they were subject to occupational segregation, sex dis-
crimination and harassment. Also as in the United States, the inferior earnings of Mexi-
can women were often justified by patriarchal assumptions that men deserve wages large 
enough to support their families, and that women are necessarily secondary or supple-
mentary earners and thus deserve less pay (Tiano, 1994). One arena of control that did 
appear to be affected by women's employment in the maquiladoras is women's enhanced 
spatial mobility and concentration in new public spaces. Fernandez-Kelly reported that 
during their leisure hours, the young women congregated in discotheques and the all-
female cervezerias (beer bars).

<p>4.3. Women Who Cross International Borders 
</p>
<p>When women and men cross international borders they meet other systems of oppression 
based on race, nationality, and citizenship, that intersect with gender relations. Accord-
ing to Glenn (1986), the primary struggle for Japanese immigrant women and their daugh-</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Migration 121 
</p>
<p>ters&mdash;and perhaps for all subordinate racial-ethnic immigrants&mdash;has not been with fighting 
gender subordination within the family, but rather with struggling against a racist society 
and an exploitative, stratified labor system. Although gender and generational conflicts 
within the family existed, they were overshadowed by societal oppression. In this regard, 
Japanese-American women used the family as a source of protection. Confronted with 
both racism and sexism, migrant women have been instrumental in forging a community 
and sustaining their culture in the new society. Black migrant women were central to the 
"southernization" of the Northeast and the Midwest United States (Hine, 1991). Indian 
immigrant women in Britain reconstructed marriage rituals and the dowry system as they 
moved into the paid labor force (Bhachu,1995). Similarly, Hondagneu-Sotelo's (1994) 
work showed that Mexican immigrant women actively consolidated settlement by par-
ticipating in and forging a community. It is they who negotiated with new institutions, 
such as schools, hospitals, and workplaces, in the new country to carry out their contin-
ued responsibilities in the home and the family. 
</p>
<p>In industrialized economies characterized by a labor market segmented by race and 
citizenship, immigrant men are rarely able to be the sole breadwinner and women's in-
come earning activities become essential to the survival of the family. This is evident by 
Hondagneu-Stoelo's (1994) finding that Mexican women gained power and autonomy 
and men lost some of their authority and privilege with migration. During spousal sepa-
rations, some men learned to cook and wash dishes. In other instances, men began to 
concede to their wives' challenges to their authority. These behaviors were not readily 
discarded when the spouses reunited. This relative change in power was seen in the emer-
gence of a more egalitarian household division of labor and by shared decision making 
power (Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1994). These gains and losses were reflected in the women's 
near unanimous preference for permanent settlement in the United States and in men's 
desire for return migration&mdash;a finding that echoes Patricia Pessar's (1986) data on Do-
minicans in New York City. 
</p>
<p>In some cases immigrant women have struck a more blatant "patriarchal bar-
gain" (Kandiyotti, 1989) with their husbands. Nazli Kibria's (1993) research on Viet-
namese immigrant families in Philadelphia explored how immigrant women used tradi-
tional gender ideology to force men to support their families. Although many of these 
women were working, and their income was essential to the survival of the family, they 
could not support the family alone. These women informally forced the men to be ac-
countable to their wives by gossip. Furthermore, to some extent women benefited from 
traditional patriarchal household relations because they gave women control over their 
children. 
</p>
<p>Fernandez-Kelly and Garcia (1990), in an article titled "Power Surrendered, Power 
Restored," found a similar dynamic among Cuban immigrant women and men. Cuban 
women's work in building family businesses contributed much to the success of the Cu-
ban economic enclave in Miami. For instance, when the family opened a garment factory, 
the women would sew until it could afford to hire other workers. While the women mo-
mentarily gained in autonomy and resources, they "surrendered" these benefits to pre-
serve traditional, patriarchal notions of manhood and womanhood. Family economic power 
ultimately strengthened their allegiance to family patriarchy. 
</p>
<p>In other cases, immigrant women fare better in the new societies than men because 
they are better able than men to mesh their traditional responsibilities, for the home and 
the children, with work for pay. Yet men's gender identity is often based on being the sole 
breadwinner. Whether or not this was completely the case back home, it is difficult to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>122 Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo AND Cynthia Cranford 
</p>
<p>sustain this ideology in the United States owing to men's precarious labor market posi-
tion. In contrast, when immigrant women work for wages they often reason that their 
wage work allows them to be a better mother by providing for their children, as Eastmond 
(1993) found among Chilean women in central California. In contrast, the Chilean men 
lost much of the public status and life meaning that they had previously derived from 
political and trade union activities. Hitchcox (1993) also argued that Vietnamese women 
in Hong Kong refugee camps were better able to accommodate to the camp's ideology 
that refugees were dependent and docile due to their dependence on men back home, 
while men were severely affected by this change from their former autonomy and control. 
</p>
<p>More research must be done on how men react to the decline in power resulting from 
migration. Recent studies suggest that some men reassert control over women in new 
ways. In a study of Vietnamese in Hong Kong refugee camps, Hitchcox (1993) showed 
how Vietnamese men reasserted control over Vietnamese women by restricting their move-
ment and raping them in response to their feelings of powerlessness. Palestinian men in 
Germany also found new ways to control Palestinian women with migration. German 
policies ensured that Palestinians cannot work, leading to men's presence in the home all 
day. Men's presence in the home did not cause them to do more household tasks but 
allowed them to restrict the mobility and the social life of the women and girls (Abdulrahim, 
1993). Finally, Pena (1991) argued that Mexican male migrant workers in California's 
agricultural fields strove to make up for their class and racial oppression by objectifying 
women in their charritas colorados, or jokes focusing on sadism toward women and 
sodomy toward males. 
</p>
<p>The reassertion of control and masculinity with migration should not be seen as 
inevitable but instead due to the intersection of gender relations with new systems of 
racial and class oppression. Indeed, a study of a Cambodian community in California 
found that the men felt less depressed by their inability to be the "rice-winner" owing to 
the high unemployment among Cambodian men within the enclave (Ui, 1991, p. 166). 
These Cambodian men took on more housework and asked their wives' permission be-
fore they spent money. Furthermore, women reassert their own gender identities in the 
face of rapid social and economic change. Jacobs and Papma (1992) found that upon 
return from the Middle East, Sri Lankan women focused on spiritual purity, such as 
praying, rather than religious rules restricting women's mobility. In doing so, they rede-
fined themselves as spiritually pure because they had been to the Holy Land, in an at-
tempt to buttress the negative view of women who migrate. These two studies suggest 
that future research should pay close attention to reassertions of masculinities and femi-
ninities within particular contexts. 
</p>
<p>In this section we focused on how gender relations change with migration. Even if 
the women stay behind, they often gain autonomy in the absence of their husbands, fa-
thers, and brothers. In some cases, this newfound power allows them to negotiate their 
own migration. Women who migrate from the rural areas to work in export processing 
zones or U.S. military bases in the cities generally gain some control over their lives, but 
are also met with occupational segregation, sexual harassment at work, and meager wages. 
Women who cross international borders meet similar constraints in labor markets now 
segmented by race and citizenship as well as gender. Yet immigrant women are defying 
the facile public-private split by incorporating wage work into their definition of a good 
mother. More research must be done on the contradictions immigrant men face as their 
status as the sole breadwinner is abruptly eroded in the new society. </p>

</p>
<p>5. FINAL THOUGHTS 
</p>
<p>In this chapter we used the growing literature on women and migration to argue for the 
use of gender, rather than women or sex roles, as an analytical focal point in our theories 
and empirical work on migration. Still, we wish to emphasize that the vast majority of 
migration and immigration research continues to exhibit androcentric biases. This is 
equally true for mainstream scholarship that seeks to evaluate, for instance, labor market 
competition between recent immigrants and native-born minorities, and for the latest, 
theoretical approach in migration studies, transnationalionism. Emerging from 
postcolonial, postmodern-inspired anthropology, and explicitly challenging the linear, 
bipolar model of "old country" and "new world," of "sojourner" and "settler," 
transnationalist proponents argue that the international circulation of people, goods, and 
ideas creates new transnational cultures, identities, and community spheres (Basch, Glick-
Schiller, &amp; Blanc-Szanton, 1994; Kearney, 1995; Rouse, 1991). That the transnationalist 
perspective should be so androcentric is striking, especially since its proponents assume 
radical posturing and early pioneers of the perspective include three women (Basch et al., 
1994). With the exception of Mahler's work (n.d.), and a short piece calling for gendered 
analysis (Sutton, 1991), transnationalism, like the assimilationist models that it counters, 
ignores gender altogether. The androcentric bias in most immigration theory and empiri-
cal work alerts us once again to the difficulties of theorizing gender when women are not 
the explicit focus. 
</p>
<p>As immigration research moves into the new century and millennium, we need re-
search strategies that do more than simply "add" women to the picture. A truly gendered 
understanding of migration requires that we use gender as an analytical tool equally 
relevant to the study of men's migration as it is to women's. In this chapter we used 
existing literature to begin to explore male-dominated migration streams as gendered. 
We argued that the Mexican contract labor program, the Bracero Program, that recruited 
only males but relied on the reproduction work of women back home, was gendered. We 
also showed that male migrants within South Africa drew on gendered power dynamics 
in their relations with one another (Moodie, 1994). 
</p>
<p>We do not need more theorizing and empirical research that examines sex differ-
ences in migration, but rather approaches that probe the gendered nature of immigration. 
Nevertheless, faced with the androcentric bias in the literature, giving space to women's 
migrant experiences is still a necessary first step toward a gendered analysis. There are 
several ways that women's experiences can be made visible even while the central unit of 
analysis is gender, rather than women. These include focusing on how social relations 
between women and men circumscribe gender-specific migration streams in some cases, 
and under what circumstances these gendered patterns exhibit change. Do migration 
patterns change with alterations in development policy in the sending nation, with trans-
formations in labor demand, with new relations between nations resulting from global-
ization, or some combination of these alternatives? A gendered analysis would show how 
social relations between women and men intersect with other institutions, such as the 
state and the economy, to produce gendered migration patterns. We also call for a focus 
on how women's and men's statuses are rearranged with migration and to what extent 
unequal gender relations are reconstructed with migration. Future immigration research 
questions might include the following: What is the relationship between gender and the 
politics of immigration, xenophobia, and citizenship? How does gender help to construct </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>124 Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo AND Cynthia Cranford 
</p>
<p>new racial and ethnic identities? As immigrants pose a challenge to nationalist con-
structs of nation, how does gender emerge to advance or retard these new constructions of 
nation? The answers to these questions, and others, await the next generation of "gender 
and migration" research.

<p>The Feminization of Poverty 
</p>
<p>Past and Future

</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>In 1978, Diana Pearce, a visiting researcher at the University of Wisconsin, published a 
</p>
<p>paper noting that poverty was becoming "feminized" in the United States. According to 
</p>
<p>Pearce, almost two thirds of the poor over age 16 were women. Women's economic status 
</p>
<p>had declined from 1950 to the mid-1970s, Pearce claimed, even though more women had 
</p>
<p>entered the labor force in those years. Female-headed households in particular formed a 
</p>
<p>larger and larger percentage of the poor. Pearce blamed the feminization of poverty on the 
</p>
<p>lack of governmeiil support for divorced and single women. She argued that "for many 
</p>
<p>the price of that independence has been their pauperization and dependence on welfare" 
</p>
<p>(Pearce, 1978, p. 28). 
</p>
<p>Following on Pearce's observation, Sara McLanahan and her colleagues used data 
</p>
<p>from the U.S. Census to examine trends in men's and women's poverty rates between 
</p>
<p>1950 and 1980 (McLanahan, Sorenson, &amp; Watson, 1989).' While providing empirical 
</p>
<p>support for Pearce's claim that poverty was becoming feminized, they also showed that 
</p>
<p>both men's and women's poverty rates had fallen dramatically during this period. Noting 
</p>
<p>that the feminization of poverty was due to a relative rather than an absolute decline in

</p>
<p>women's economic status, McLanahan and her colleagues blamed the feminization of 
poverty on changes in the family that had uncovered women's latent economic vulner-
ability. Among working age adults, the growth of single parent families was the crucial 
factor; among the elderly, it was declines in mortality and increases in the propensity to 
live alone. 
</p>
<p>Recently, Paula England (1997) noted that the feminization of poverty has stopped 
going up and may even be reversing among some groups. England attributes these changes 
to improvements in women's earnings, which have risen both absolutely and relative to 
men's during the 1980s and 1990s. She argues that since 1980, the gains in women's 
employment and earnings have been large enough to offset the changes in family struc-
ture and that these gains are beginning to close the poverty gap between men and women. 
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we examine the trends in men's and women's absolute and relative 
poverty rates between 1950 and 1996. We discuss and assess three explanations for the 
feminization of poverty, including Pearce's claims that the meager welfare benefits led to 
the feminization of poverty, McLanahan's argument that changing family structures were 
the principal culprit, and England's assertion that gains in women's earnings are begin-
ning to close the gap. We end by reviewing cross-national evidence of the feminization of 
poverty. These comparisons show how family structure, earnings, and government trans-
fer programs have allowed some countries to avoid the feminization of poverty. 
</p>
<p>1.1. Defining the Terms 
</p>
<p>Before we begin our story, we need to say something about how poverty is defined and 
how the feminization of poverty is measured. In the United States, poverty is defined as 
not having enough income to pay for basic needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter. 
Poverty is a family attribute. In other words, if a family is classified as poor, all the 
members of that family are poor.^ To determine whether or not a family is poor, the 
Census Bureau sums the income of all the members of the family and divides by the "need 
standard" or "poverty threshhold" for a family of that size. 
</p>
<p>The "needs standard" or "poverty threshold" was developed in 1964 by Mollie 
Orshansky, an economist at the Social Security Administration (Ruggles, 1994). To de-
termine a family's "basic needs," Orshansky used data from an expenditure survey con-
ducted in the mid-1950s that showed that the typical American family spent about one 
third of its income on food. From this study, Orshansky reasoned that to live above the 
poverty hne, the family's income should be about three times the cost of the "basic food 
basket," defined as the minimal nutritional requirements for a healthy diet. To determine 
the latter, Orshansky used information from the Department of Agriculture. She then 
estimated the cost of the food basket and multiplied by a factor of three to get the official 
"poverty threshold" for the average American family. Ultimately, a set of thresholds was 
created to take account of economies of scale associated with families of different sizes 
and compositions. Each year the poverty thresholds are adjusted for changes in the cost of 
living. Otherwise they remain very similar to the ones created by Orshansky (1965) in the 
early 1960s. 
</p>
<p>The official poverty line used by the U.S. government has been criticized on numer-
</p>
<p>^ For single people, only their own income is counted when determining poverty. If unrelated single adults share a 
</p>
<p>household, each person counts as a separate "family" for determining poverty. </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>The Feminization of Poverty 129 
</p>
<p>ous accounts (Citro &amp; Michael, 1995; Ruggles, 1994). First, the poverty line is based on 
gross earnings, before taxes. Families may be unable to meet their basic needs with the 
income they bring home, but they will not be counted as poor if their before-tax income is 
above the poverty threshhold. In this way, the current U.S. poverty rates may underesti-
mate poverty among the working poor. 
</p>
<p>Second, government transfers, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), food 
stamps, public housing, and Medicaid, are not counted as income for the purposes of 
determining poverty.' Some people may be counted as poor because their earned income 
is very low, but they may be able to meet their basic needs through using other govern-
ment programs. In this way, the current U.S. poverty rates may overestimate poverty 
among people who receive benefits from certain government programs. 
</p>
<p>Third, the poverty measure implicitly assumes that money is equally shared among 
members of a family. This assumption is not necessarily correct. It is certainly plausible 
that the person who earns the money may have more control over its use, or a man might 
control the money as part of his breadwinner identity, or there might be some other un-
equal arrangement. 
</p>
<p>A fourth criticism of the poverty line measure is that it is based on an absolute rather 
than a relative standard. A poor family today is much worse off, relative to the average 
family, than a poor family was in the 1960s (McLanahan, 1995). This is because the 
living standards of the median family have increased dramatically during the past 35 
years, while the poverty thresholds still assume that families need only three times their 
basic food needs. Some scholars have suggested setting the poverty line at a given propor-
tion of the median income, rather than having it reflect a fixed amount of money. For 
example, families with incomes below 50% of the median family income (adjusted for 
family size) would be classified as poor. With a relative measure, poverty measures eco-
nomic standing in the society, rather than marking economic destitution or the inability 
to feed, clothe, or house one's family. 
</p>
<p>Many other countries use a relative standard for poverty (Smeeding, Higgins, &amp; 
Rainwater, 1990). As we will see in the cross-national comparisons later, if the United 
States adopted a relative standard, poverty rates would be significantly higher than they 
are under the official poverty measure. The difference reflects different ideas of what 
poverty is&mdash;relative economic disadvantage or the inability to cover basic needs. 
</p>
<p>The term feminization of poverty focuses our attention on sex differences in poverty 
rates and the fact that they have grown in the last half-century. Feminization describes 
both the unequal state of men's and women's poverty rates and the processes by which 
women's risk of poverty has increasingly exceeded that of men's. In her articles, Pearce 
(1978, 1984) focused on the proportion of the poor who were female. Other scholars, 
including England and McLanahan and her colleagues, have focused on the ratio of 
women's poverty rates to men's rates (Casper, McLanahan, &amp; Garfinkel, 1994; McLanahan, 
Casper, &amp; Sorensen, 1995; McLanahan et al., 1989). A sex/poverty ratio greater than one 
means that women have a higher poverty rate than men. For example, a poverty rate of 
1.50, which is close to the number today for all adults, means that women's poverty rate 
is about 50% higher than men's. 
</p>
<p>Sex differences in poverty rates are a function of the differences in poverty rates 
among single men and single women weighted by the proportion of adults who are single 
</p>
<p>3 Government cash transfers, such as AFDC, TANF, and Social Security payments, are counted as income when 
</p>
<p>determining poverty. </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>(i.e., not married). Since poverty is measured at the family level, sex differences in pov-
erty can exist only among unmarried men and women. If all adults were married, and if 
boys and girls were evenly distributed across households, the sex/poverty ratio would be 
1.0. Of course, some families would still be poor, but there would be no sex differences in 
poverty because each poor man would be linked to a poor woman. 
</p>
<p>The sex/poverty ratio, our measure of the feminization of poverty, can change when 
either the percentage of single adults changes or when the poverty rates of single men and 
women change. As we shall see later, both these factors have changed during the past 
four decades. 
</p>
<p>1.2. Trends in Poverty Rates and Poverty Ratios 
</p>
<p>Figure 7-1 reports poverty rates for men and women of all ages from 1950 to 1996. 
Several points about Fig. 7-1 are worth noting. First, blacks have much higher poverty 
rates than whites, regardless of their sex; and women have much higher rates than men, 
regardless of their race."* Second, poverty rates fell dramatically between 1950 and 1970, 
and have leveled off since then. The trends are quite similar for whites and blacks and for 
men and women: large declines during the 1950s and 1960s, followed by very small 
changes during the 1980s and 1990s. 
</p>
<p>The leveling off in poverty rates after 1970 actually masks two quite distinct trends 
among young adults and the elderly. After 1970 (as shown in Figs. 7-2A and B), elderly 
adults continued to experience falling poverty rates, while young men and women saw 
their rates go up. The disparity between the two age groups is especially prominent among 
men. In 1950, elderly males had the next to highest poverty rate; in 1996, they had the 
lowest rate. Over the same period, young women went from having the next to lowest 
poverty rate to having the highest rate. 
</p>
<p>Table 7-1 reports the trends in the sex/poverty ratios between 1950 and 1996. The 
first set of numbers is taken from the McLanahan et al. article (1989) which was based on 
the 1950, 1960, and 1970 decennial censuses. The second set of numbers is taken directly 
from the Current Population Surveys. Notice that the two data sets yield different ratios 
for young adults in 1970. This is because a different set of age cutoffs was used in the two 
analyses. To examine trends between 1950 and 1970, McLanahan and her colleagues 
used 18 to 24 as their age cutoff. To examine trends between 1970 and 1996, we used 18 
to 30. Thus, we would not expect the two sets of figures to be identical in 1970. The sex/ 
poverty ratios for middle-aged, elderly, and the total population also differ slightly, al-
though the discrepancy is much smaller. In this instance, the analyses used the same age 
cutoffs and the difference is due to differences in the data themselves. 
</p>
<p>In presenting these numbers, our point is not to provide precise estimates of the sex/ 
poverty ratio for any particular group or period. Rather it is to document the trends in the 
data. For this purpose, we are confident that our numbers tell a consistent story. 
</p>
<p>'' We focus on whites and blacks in this chapter. Our primary purpose is to chronicle and explain the trends in 
</p>
<p>poverty rates and sex differences in poverty. Because we consider changes across time, we need to look at stable 
</p>
<p>populations (or groups within those populations). Hispanics are now a large minority group within the United 
</p>
<p>States, but there has been so much immigration during this period that it is difficult to compare the Hispanic 
</p>
<p>poverty rates over time. Also, there are no data from these sources on Hispanics until 1980. For research on 
</p>
<p>poverty among various Hispanic populations, see Aponte (1993) and Tienda (1995). For information on immi-
</p>
<p>grants and economic outcomes, see Portes (1996) and Portes and Rumbault (1997). </p>

1996. 
Notes: The age classifications differ by source. The Census figures use 18 to 24 for young, 25 to 64 for middle-aged, and 65+ for 
elderly. The CPS figures use 18 to 30 for young, 31 to 64 for middle-aged, and 65+ for elderly. The only notable effect is the 
difference for the young age groups, where the sex/poverty ratio is lower if only 18- to 24-year-olds are included. 
</p>
<p>To sum up briefly, a rather dramatic feminization of poverty occurred between 1950 
and 1970, among all age groups and among both whites and blacks. Interestingly, it 
occurred at a time when poverty rates for both men and women were falling rapidly. 
Because men's poverty rate declined faster than women's rates, the sex/poverty ratio 
increased. 
</p>
<p>After 1970, the story becomes a bit more complicated. For the population as a whole, 
the feminization of poverty peaked in 1970 among whites and in 1980 among blacks. 
Then it leveled off. The latter trend masks two rather different patterns. Among the eld-
erly, the feminization of poverty has continued to rise unabated. Between 1980 and 1996, 
the sex/poverty ratio grew by 69% among whites and by 65% among blacks. Whereas, in 
1950, elderly women were only slightly more likely to be poor than elderly men, today 
they are more than twice as likely to be poor. Overall, poverty rates for elderly men and 
women decreased significantly, as in the earlier decades, but again, men's rates have 
fallen much more quickly than women's. 
</p>
<p>Among working aged adults, the feminization of poverty stopped increasing some 
time after 1970, and may even be reversing. Among white middle-aged adults, a 
"defeminization of poverty" occurred in both the 1970s and the 1980s. 
</p>
<p>2. EXPLAINING THE FEMINIZATION OF POVERTY 
</p>
<p>Why has the sex/poverty ratio grown so rapidly over the last 50 years? Why were women 
</p>
<p>only slightly more likely than men to be poor in 1950, whereas today they about 50% 
</p>
<p>more likely? What accounts for the leveling off, and the possible reversal, of the femini-
</p>
<p>zation of poverty among some age groups after 1980? In this section, we try to answer 
</p>
<p>these questions. We focus on three changes that have profoundly altered the social and 
</p>
<p>economic conditions of American men and women during the past 40 years: changes in 
</p>
<p>the family, in the economy, and in the welfare state. As described in the following, some 
</p>
<p>of these changes have clearly benefited men"more than women. Others have benefited 
</p>
<p>women more than men, and still others have had different effects at different times. </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Feminization of Poverty 
</p>
<p>2.1. Changes in the Family 
</p>
<p>135 
</p>
<p>Starting with changes in the family, several demographic trends are important. The first 
of these is the delay in the age of first marriage. Throughout the 1950s, the typical young 
woman married when she was about 20 years old and the typical young man married 
when he was about 23. By 1990, however, the median age at first marriage&mdash;the age at 
which half of the population married for the first time&mdash;was 24 for women and 26 for 
men (McLanahan &amp; Casper, 1994). 
</p>
<p>A second major change is the rise in divorce (Fig. 7-3). Whereas, in 1950, most 
people married and remained married until they (or their spouses) died, today more than 
half of all couples end their marriages voluntarily. The divorce rate&mdash;the number of di-
vorces each year per 1000 married women&mdash;rose steadily during the first half of the 
twentieth century and increased dramatically after 1960. More than half of all marriages 
contracted in the mid-1980s were projected to end in divorce (Castro Martin &amp; Bumpass, 
1989). The divorce rate leveled off during the 1980s, but this was not necessarily a sign of 
greater stability. We would have expected such a leveling off, given the increase in the 
average age at first marriage, and given the fact that the large baby boom cohorts had 
reached middle age and passed through the period of their lives when they were most 
likely to divorce (Bumpass &amp; Sweet, 1989). 
</p>
<p>The increase in divorce, coupled with the decline in marriage, meant that an in-
creasing proportion of adult women were living separately from men and relying on 
themselves for economic support. Since women generally earn less than men for various 
reasons (see later), single women have a higher risk of being poor than single men. In

</p>
<p>short, if nothing else changes, declines in marriage will lead to increases in the sex/ 
poverty ratio. 
</p>
<p>We should point out that American women are more independent (socially, psycho-
logically, and economically) today than they were in the 1950s, and more of them are 
opting out of traditional family arrangements in spite of the economic costs. Since pov-
erty measures only one aspect of well-being, we cannot say that women who live alone are 
"worse off overall than men or than women living with men. Indeed, the fact that so 
many women are choosing to remain single suggests that the benefits of independence 
may outweigh the costs associated with a lower standard of living. 
</p>
<p>A third trend affecting family arrangements is the increase in number of children 
born outside marriage (Fig. 7-4). In 1960 about 6% of all births were to unmarried couples 
whereas by 1996 more than a third fell into this category. The increase is even more 
dramatic among black families&mdash;from 22% in 1960 to nearly 70% in 1996. These changes 
in fertility are due to several factors, including the decline in marriage, which increases 
the pool of women at risk for having an out-of-wedlock birth; the decline in the birth rate 
among married couples (which was especially steep during the 1960s and early 1970s); 
and the increase in the birth rate among single women (which has risen since 1980). 
</p>
<p>The net result of the changes in fertility and the increases in divorce among couples 
with children has been the growth of single-mother families (Garfinkel &amp; McLanahan, 
1986). In 1960, only 8% of families were headed by a single mother; today the number is 
about 27%. Blacks are much more Ukely than whites to fall into this category, with more 
than half of all black families now consisting of a single mother and her dependent chil-
dren. The trends are similar for all race and ethnic groups, however. 
</p>
<p>Single parenthood has affected women's poverty rates much more than it has men's. 
Whereas in principle, responsibility for children could be evenly distributed between 
mothers and fathers after a divorce or a nonmarital birth, in practice, women almost 
always have custody of the child (about 90% of single parents are women). Thus, not only

</p>
<p>do single women earn less money than single men, but their needs, as defined by the 
poverty threshold, are greater than men's because they have more dependents. Again, we 
should point out that most mothers, when faced with a divorce or a nonmarital birth, 
prefer to have custody of their child, despite the economic hardships associated with 
single motherhood. However, as noted previously, these women pay a high financial price 
for their independence. 
</p>
<p>A fourth demographic trend affecting the family life of men and women is the in-
crease in "nonfamily" households, particularly, the increase in one-person households. In 
1940, only 10% of all households were classified as "nonfamily" households, whereas in 
the early 1990s, more than 30% were of this type (Sweet &amp; Bumpass, 1987). Until re-
cently, nonfamily households were more common among blacks than among whites. To-
day, however, the proportions are nearly the same for both races. Hispanics, in contrast, 
have always had lower rates of nonfamily households. 
</p>
<p>Young adults and the elderly are especially likely to live in nonfamily households. 
For young people, this change is associated with the decline in marriage and the increase 
in cohabitation. Interestingly, couples who are cohabiting are not counted as families by 
the Census Bureau, even though they may be pooling their incomes and sharing ex-
penses. Thus the poverty rates of many of these couples are likely to be overstated. Since 
young women are somewhat more likely to cohabit than young men, treating cohabitators 
as nonfamily households leads to an overestimate of women's poverty rates relative to 
men's (McLanahan &amp; Casper, 1995). 
</p>
<p>The elderly are also much more likely to live independently today than they were 50 
years ago (Treas, 1995). This change is generally viewed as a sign of progress, and most 
elderly people report that they prefer their independence. Whereas in the past, a majority 
of elderly people lived with their adult children once they were widowed, today, more and 
more widows and widowers live alone. The increase in the proportion of elderly living 
alone is due in part to increases in Social Security income. 
</p>
<p>A final trend affecting the sex differential in poverty rates is the increase in life 
expectancy. More specifically, women are likely to live longer than men and so their 
retirement income has to stretch over more years. The differences in men's and women's 
life expectancies have grown over these years. In 1940, men at age 65 had a life expect-
ancy only 17 months shorter than that of women aged 65. In 1993, men at age 65 had a 
life expectancy 47 months&mdash;almost 4 years&mdash;shorter than that of women aged 65 (Advi-
sory Council on Social Security, 1996, p. 261). 
</p>
<p>2.2. Changes in the Economy 
</p>
<p>Changes in family composition reflect changes in the needs of the family&mdash;the denomi-
</p>
<p>nator of the poverty function. There have also been important changes in men's and 
</p>
<p>women's earnings and income experiences&mdash;the numerator of the poverty function&mdash; 
</p>
<p>during this period. Women's labor force participation has increased over most of the 
</p>
<p>twentieth century (Blau, 1997; Spain &amp; Bianchi, 1996). The changes have been larger in 
</p>
<p>recent decades than in the early 1900s, with many American women seeking and finding 
</p>
<p>employment since 1960. 
</p>
<p>The increase has been most dramatic for married women and for women with chil-
</p>
<p>dren. In the early 1950s, only about 30% of married mothers with school-aged children 
</p>
<p>were working outside the home. By 1990, this number had risen to more than 73%. The </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>138 Sara S. McLanahan AND Erin L. Kelly 
</p>
<p>figures for mothers with preschool children (under age 6) are even more dramatic. In 
1960, only 19% of married mothers with preschool children were in the labor force, 
whereas, by 1990, 59% were employed. Women's employment increased over this entire 
period, but especially in the 1970s and 1980s. These years also saw some decreases in 
men's employment, with the reductions occurring mostly among younger and older workers 
(Wetzel, 1995). Young men, especially those with little education and few marketable 
skills, withdrew from the labor force. Older men also left work, many of them taking 
early retirement because their jobs were being downsized or their plants closed (Wetzel, 
1995). 
</p>
<p>The increase in women's employment means that women are gaining more experi-
ence in the labor market, which, all else being equal, should increase their ability to 
support themselves and their families. Equally important, women are also gaining on 
men with respect to their hourly wages (Blau, 1997; Spain &amp; Bianchi, 1996). From 1960 
to 1980, full-time women workers averaged about 60% of full-time male workers' earn-
ings. Since 1981, however, the ratio of women's earnings to men's earnings has increased 
to about 70%. During the 1980s, highly educated workers did well while those without a 
college education saw falling wages (Wetzel, 1995). This division was true of both men 
and women, but highly educated women's wages increased more than men's while less 
educated women's wages fell less than men's. Overall, women's earnings have increased 
relative to men's, raising the female-to-male wage ratio. 
</p>
<p>England's (1997) argument that women's earnings have helped reduce the sex/pov-
erty ratio is supported by the timing of the relative wage increases and the sex/poverty 
ratio decreases. The declining sex gap in wages is caused by both women's increased 
earnings (owing to greater labor force participation and higher wage rates) and men's 
stagnant wages since the late 1970s. In fact, men's economic status has declined in recent 
years as women's earnings have improved slightly. For whites, the period in which women's 
relative wages began climbing corresponds to the period in which the sex/poverty ratio 
fell. This finding suggests that women's wages have led to the reversal in trends. 
</p>
<p>The exception to the defeminization trend also offers some support for England's 
argument about wage effects. If changes in women's earnings (relative to men's) are 
largely responsible for the reversal in the sex/poverty ratio, we would not expect to ob-
serve a reversal among the age groups who are less likely to be working, namely among 
retired persons. From 1970 to 1996, the sex/poverty ratio did not decline for women over 
65 years. Since elderly women are less likely to be employed, and quite likely to be living 
without men, they did not benefit from the improvements in employment and earnings 
that accrued to women in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</p>
<p>2.3. Changes in Public Benefits 
</p>
<p>Besides relying on their earnings, many Americans receive income from government 
</p>
<p>transfers. Government transfers serve as a buffer against the risk of poverty and economic 
</p>
<p>insecurity. If a family's income from earnings does not meet its needs, transfer income 
</p>
<p>may provide the extra income needed to lift the family out of poverty. However, govern-
</p>
<p>ment transfer programs differ in how generous they are, and thus how successfully they 
</p>
<p>keep households out of poverty. The three main government transfer programs in the 
</p>
<p>United States are Aid to Families with Dependent Children (now TANF), which is a </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Feminization of Poverty 139 
</p>
<p>program mostly benefiting poor single mothers and their children; Supplementary Secu-
rity Income (SSI), a program benefiting disabled, blind, and poor elderly adults; and Old 
Age Survivors, Disability, and Unemployment Insurance, a set of programs for disabled, 
unemployed, and retired workers. 
</p>
<p>The first two programs, TANF and SSI, provide "income-tested" benefits which 
means that a family must be poor to qualify for the benefit. The income test creates a 
"Catch 22" with respect to poverty. If a family that qualifies for the benefit manages to 
increase its income (from other sources) enough to lift it above the poverty line, the 
family no longer qualifies for the benefit. In fact, eligibility thresholds are generally set 
below the poverty line, so a family can be cut off from these programs even though its 
income is well below the poverty line. Thus income-tested programs, by design, do not 
lift many families out of poverty, although they reduce the depth of their poverty. Social 
insurance programs, in contrast, are guaranteed to all adults who qualify, regardless of 
their economic status. These payments (which include most Social Security benefits) are 
also much larger, per person, than TANF or SSI. As a consequence, their poverty reduc-
tion effects are very large. 
</p>
<p>We should point out that several other government programs providing support to 
low-income families were initiated during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including food 
stamps, public housing and housing vouchers, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax 
Credit (EITC). The EITC, which supplements the earnings of the household head in 
working poor families, is one of the most generous and most effective antipoverty pro-
grams in the United States. However, since benefits are provided through the tax system, 
they are not counted as income in calculating the official poverty rates. Neither food 
stamps nor housing subsidies are counted as income, although both of these programs 
cover "basic needs" and are similar to cash transfers in many respects. 
</p>
<p>If government transfer programs played a large role in the feminization of poverty 
and the recent reversal of the trend, then changes in these programs should correspond to 
changes in poverty rates and sex/poverty ratios. To some extent, the trend in benefits 
corresponds to the trends in poverty rates. During the years in which feminization first 
occurred&mdash;1950 to 1970&mdash;both AFDC and Social Security were expanding rapidly, not 
only in terms of the number of people covered but also in terms of the value of the benefits 
themselves. AFDC rose during the 1950s and 1960s, as the federal government waged a 
"war on poverty." Similarly, Social Security pension coverage was expanded during these 
two decades and the value of the benefit was increased several times. 
</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 7-1, poverty rates fell dramatically during this time. Social Secu-
rity benefits undoubtedly played a role in reducing poverty among elderly men and women, 
and welfare did the same for single mothers. Recall that these were the years in which 
family structure was changing quickly, and the increased availability of AFDC probably 
helped to offset some of the negative consequences of these changes on women's eco-
nomic status. 
</p>
<p>Many conservatives would disagree with the statement that women's poverty rates 
would have been higher without welfare benefits. Instead, they would argue that the growing 
availability of welfare benefits during this period actually increased women's risk of pov-
erty by fueling the growth of single-mother families (Murray, 1984). While, theoretically, 
it makes sense to think that AFDC benefits might encourage some poor women to leave a 
bad marriage or to keep a child who was conceived out of wedlock, the empirical evi-
dence on this issue indicates that the size of the effect is very small (Moffitt, 1998). This </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>140 Sara S. McLanahan AND Erin L. Kelly 
</p>
<p>finding should not surprise anyone who is familiar with the demographic trends described 
earlier (delays in marriage, declines in marital fertility, increases in one-person house-
holds) since these trends have been occurring among women of all social class back-
grounds, including women who have never been forced to rely on welfare. Nevertheless, 
the conservatives raise an important point and draw our attention to the fact that the 
relationships between changes in the family, the labor market, and in public transfers are 
probably reciprocal. 
</p>
<p>After 1970, the trends in AFDC and social insurance diverged sharply. Social Secu-
rity pensions for the elderly were raised again and indexed to inflation in the early 1970s, 
and the value of these benefits continued to rise throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. 
In contrast, welfare benefits, which were not linked to inflation, peaked in the mid-1970s 
and then began to fall. Initially, the decline in AFDC was due to high inflation in the 
second half of the 1970s. After 1980, however, declines were due to direct cuts in benefits 
as well as to inflation. 
</p>
<p>The decline in government transfers for women of childbearing age after the mid-
1970s is consistent with the leveling off of poverty rates among women between the ages 
of 18 and 64 during the 1970s and 1980s. That is, poverty rates stopped declining about 
the time that welfare benefits stopped increasing. Similarly, the rise in Social Security 
benefits for retired adults after 1970 is consistent with the continuing decline in poverty 
rates among the elderly. 
</p>
<p>Given that Social Security has played an important role in driving down the poverty 
rates of the elderly, why have women's poverty rates been slower to decline than men's? 
The feminization of poverty among the elderly is a result of several factors. First, pen-
sions for never married women are lower, on average, than pensions for never married 
men since women earn less than men while they are working. Second, retirement benefits 
are set when a person reaches age 65 (or retires), and despite that fact that they are 
indexed to inflation, the original benefit is not adjusted for increases that postdate retire-
ment. In particular, people who retired before the early 1970s have substantially lower 
pensions than people who retired after 1970. Since women live longer than men, they are 
more likely to fall into this group than men. Finally, elderly women are more likely to live 
alone than elderly men, and thus they must live on one pension rather than two. For all 
these reasons, poverty rates among elderly women have not declined as fast as poverty 
rates among elderly men. 
</p>
<p>2.4. Decomposing the Trends 
</p>
<p>To try and gain a better idea of the forces behind the leveling off of the sex/poverty ratio 
</p>
<p>between 1970 and 1996 and the relative importance of changes in the family and changes 
</p>
<p>in labor market opportunities, we conducted a simple thought experiment. We asked, if 
</p>
<p>only family structure had changed between 1970 and 1996 and everything else had stayed 
</p>
<p>the same, what would the sex/poverty ratio have been? Next we asked a similar question 
</p>
<p>about changes in employment and earnings. If only men's and women's personal earn-
</p>
<p>ings had changed between 1970 and 1996, what would the sex/poverty ratio have been? 
</p>
<p>To answer these questions, we estimated multivariate regression equations that treated 
</p>
<p>poverty in 1970 as a function of family characteristics, personal earnings, and a set of 
</p>
<p>other variables measured in 1970. Family structure was divided into five categories: mar-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Feminization of Poverty 141 
</p>
<p>ried couple (with or without children), single parent with minor children, one-person 
households, other households with children, and other households without children. We 
ran separate equations for men and women, blacks and whites, and three age groups: 18 
to 30, 31 to 64, and 65+. 
</p>
<p>Next, we substituted the 1996 means for the family structure variables into the 1970 
equations and obtained predicted poverty rates for men and women, holding all the other 
values constant. Using the predicted poverty rates, we then calculated a new set of sex/ 
poverty ratios for each sex, race, and age group. We repeated the process, this time substi-
tuting 1996 personal earnings for 1970 earnings and holding family structure constant. 
The results are reported in Table 7-2. 
</p>
<p>According to Table 7-2, if only family composition had changed between 1970 and 
1996, the sex/poverty ratio for young whites would have been 1.47, which is 14 percent-
age points higher than the observed ratio in 1996. In contrast, if only men's and women's 
earnings had changed during this period, the sex/poverty ratio would have been less than 
1. These simulations are only illustrative. However, they demonstrate that employment 
changes strongly favored women during this period and offset some of the negative ef-
fects associated with changes in family composition. The patterns for middle-aged white 
women and for both young and middle-aged black women are similar. If only family 
composition had changed between 1970 and 1996, sex/poverty ratios would have been 
even higher than they actually were. If only earnings had changed, the ratios would have 
been much closer to parity.

</p>
<p>3. CROSS-NATIONAL COMPARISONS 
</p>
<p>Another approach to understanding the feminization of poverty is to ask why it does not 
occur in some settings. Casper et al. (1994) examined sex differences in poverty in eight 
countries and asked how some countries have managed to avoid the feminization of pov-
erty (Fig. 7-5). They considered how factors related to income (i.e., age, education, and 
employment status) and needs (i.e., marital status, parental status) led to different poverty 
rates and sex/poverty ratios among these eight countries. These researchers found that large 
gender differentials in poverty rates have been avoided in three countries, for three different 
reasons. The important factors are distinctive family structures in Italy, distinctive employ-
ment patterns in Sweden, and distinctive government transfers in the Netherlands. The 
Netherlands findings are useful because government transfers have not played a large 
role in reducing poverty or preventing the feminization of poverty in the United States. 
This example shows that government programs can and do reduce poverty rates and close 
the gap between men's and women's poverty rates if they are generous enough. 
</p>
<p>Italy has very high marriage rates and so almost no difference in men's and women's 
likelihood of living in poverty. Because almost every adult man is paired to an adult 
woman, there are poor Italians but very little difference between men's and women's 
likelihood of living in poverty. If U.S. adults had marital patterns equal to those of Italian 
adults (but otherwise had the same characteristics that they actually do have), the sex/ 
poverty ratio in the United States would be reduced by 71% (Casper et al., 1994). 
</p>
<p>In Sweden, men are actually slightly more likely than women to live in poverty. This 
unusual situation is explained by women's high labor force participation. Since Swedish 
women are very likely to be employed and there is only a small wage gap between men's 
and women's average earnings, women are not more likely than men to live in poverty. If 
U.S. women had the same labor force participation rates as Swedish women, the sex/ 
poverty ratio would be reduced by 60%. In some other Western countries with relatively 
low levels of women's employment, female labor force participation rates similar to 
Sweden's would entirely eliminate the poverty gap (Casper et al., 1994, p. 600). 
</p>
<p>While Sweden illustrates the potential of women's earnings for reducing the sex/ 
poverty ratio, it is important to realize that Swedish government policy facilitates women's 
employment and women's high relative earnings in several ways. Government policies 
that encourage women's employment include a tax system that taxes persons on their 
own earnings (rather than having a joint filing option for married couples) and a parental 
leave system that grants long paid leaves to mothers and fathers of infants. In addition to 
the leaves, government policies allow parents of young children to reduce their work 
hours for several years while keeping their old jobs (Kamerman &amp; Kahn, 1991). The 
government also encourages wage equality between men and women through its involve-
ment in collective bargaining agreements and the fact that the state employs a very large 
number of women workers itself. Therefore, earnings have aided women in Sweden, but 
the government has played a large role in increasing women's earnings. 
</p>
<p>The Netherlands also has a very low sex/poverty ratio, but its marriage, parenting, 
and employment rates are not unusual. It seems that "the low poverty rates and the low 
gender-poverty ratio in the Netherlands is largely due to the generous welfare system" 
(Casper et al., 1994, p. 602). In the Netherlands, single parenting is common and single 
mothers are not likely to be employed full-time. However, the Dutch have avoided sex 
differences in poverty rates because the government transfers to single mothers are gener-
ous enough to lift those women and their families out of poverty. </p>

<p>The cross-national comparisons confirm the importance of family status, earnings, 
</p>
<p>and transfer payments in explaining poverty rates and the feminization of poverty. This 
</p>
<p>research also suggests that there may be multiple ways to reduce the disparities between 
</p>
<p>men's and women's poverty rates. Americans interested in reducing the feminization of 
</p>
<p>poverty could design public policies to encourage any or all three of these conditions, 
</p>
<p>although these policies might increase gender inequalities in other areas.

<p>4. CONCLUSIONS 
</p>
<p>The changes in poverty rates and sex differences in poverty have occurred in two major 
</p>
<p>periods, from 1950 to 1970 and from 1970 to 1996. In the decades after World War II, </p>

</p>
<p>poverty rates declined dramatically. This was a period of strong economic growth, in-
cluding rising wages, and expansion of government benefits, such as Social Security and 
welfare programs. Both of these forces lowered poverty rates. As poverty rates declined, 
the sex/poverty ratio increased for all groups. The growing inequality in men's and women's 
poverty rates was caused by several factors. First, the wage growth that lowered poverty 
rates benefited men more than women because they were more closely attached to the 
labor market. Second, changes in family structure hurt women more than men, mainly 
because women bore more responsibility for children in the growing number of unmar-
ried households. 
</p>
<p>After 1970, poverty rates stopped declining. During the 1970s, the economy stag-
nated and when it recovered in the 1980s, the main beneficiaries were college graduates 
rather than less educated workers living near the poverty line. The sex/poverty ratio con-
tinued to increase among the elderly, but stopped increasing among working age adults. 
The sex/poverty ratio may be reversing as the gap between women's and men's poverty 
rates closes somewhat. The sex/poverty ratio is increasing among the elderly partly be-
cause older women are living longer than men, and these older women often rely on a 
single Social Security benefit for many years. The sex/poverty ratio has stopped climbing 
for working aged adults, even though families have continued to change in ways that 
leave women with a large economic burden. The stagnant economy apparently has hurt 
men more than it has hurt women. Women's wages have slowly gained on men's over the 
last 15 years, stopping the increased feminization of poverty. It is important to note, 
however, that women are still much more likely&mdash;about 50% more likely overall&mdash;than 
men to live in poverty. 
</p>
<p>Cross-national comparisons show us that the feminization of poverty is avoidable. 
The Netherlands keeps the sex/poverty ratio low by establishing a high income floor; the 
welfare state does not allow anyone to be poor, regardless of family status or employment 
situation. Sweden keeps the sex/poverty ratio low by subsidizing employment and by 
keeping wages high through union agreements. Since women's labor force participation 
is very high, this ensures that few women are poor. Unlike the Netherlands or Sweden, 
Italy has fairly high levels of poverty but the high marriage rates keep sex differences in 
poverty very low.

<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>Although the feminist project in sociology during the last 30 years has varied theoreti-
</p>
<p>cally, methodologically, and substantively, much of the scholarship on gender has fo-
</p>
<p>cused on the maintenance of gender stratification and the resilience of gender inequality. 
</p>
<p>Only recently have gender scholars turned to exploring and theorizing the historicity of 
</p>
<p>gender and processes of gender resistance, challenge, and change. Given the persistence 
</p>
<p>of gender inequality and the universality of gender oppression, it is not surprising that 
</p>
<p>researchers have concentrated so heavily on documenting the extent, forms, and causes of 
</p>
<p>gender stratification. We do know, however, that the dynamics of gender and the extent of 
</p>
<p>gender inequality vary over time and place. Such historical and contextual variability 
</p>
<p>raises important theoretical and empirical questions for sociologists interested in pro-
</p>
<p>cesses of gender change. 
</p>
<p>One area of research that has begun to examine gender transformation is the schol-
</p>
<p>arship on social movements, particularly the emerging literature on feminist movements 
</p>
<p>in the United States (Buechler, 1990; Ferree &amp; Hess, 1994; Ferree &amp; Martin, 1995; Free-
</p>

</p>
<p>Staggenborg, 1991; Whittier 1995). This literature focuses largely on the mobilization, 
</p>
<p>ideologies, organizations, leadership patterns, strategies, and tactics of women's move-

<p>ments. Although this body of research has illustrated the critical role that women's col-
lective action has played in altering gender relations in the United States, scholarship on 
the gender effects of social movements nevertheless remains fairly descriptive. This is 
because social movement researchers, in general, have concentrated more on the mobili-
zation of social movements than on their consequences. Recently, however, some move-
ment scholars have begun to explore the gendered nature of social movements (Barnett, 
1993; Brown &amp; Ferguson, 1995; Gamson, 1997; McAdam, 1992; Naples, 1992a; 
Neuhouser, 1995; Reger, Whittier, &amp; Taylor, 1995; Robnett, 1996; Taylor, 1999; West &amp; 
Blumberg, 1990) and to trace the effects of social movements on gender relations 
(Staggenborg, 1997; Taylor, 1996; Taylor &amp; Van Willigen, 1996). We believe that devel-
oping analytical frameworks that integrate the literatures on gender and social move-
ments offers sociologists an excellent opportunity to understand the dynamic nature of 
gender and the significance of human agents in the making and remaking of femininity, 
masculinity, and the existing gender order (see, e.g., Taylor, 1996; Taylor &amp; Van Willigen, 
1996). 
</p>
<p>This chapter seeks to emphasize the role of social movements in gender change by 
examining the diverse, multiple, and often contradictory social movement activities orga-
nized around gender in the United States. Specifically, we focus on the various and some-
times paradoxical ideologies and organizational structures of the modern women's move-
ment. Given this goal, it is useful at the outset to outline a framework for analyzing the 
outcomes of social movements that makes it possible to link theoretical approaches to 
gender with existing theory in social movements. We then trace the larger macrostruc-
tural preconditions that underlie the emergence of feminist movements in most Western 
societies. After a brief examination of feminist mobilization in an international context, 
we turn to our central purpose in this chapter, which is to examine the continuity and 
transformation of the contemporary feminist movement in the United States and the mul-
tiple and shifting strategies collective actors have used in the struggle for equality be-
tween women and men. We conclude by exploring two other strands of activism, men's 
movements and antifeminist countermovements, which also are engaged in the social 
construction and reconstruction of gender in the United States. 
</p>
<p>2. GENDER AND SOCIAL MOVEMENT THEORIES 
</p>
<p>If there is a single point on which gender scholars agree, it is that notions of femininity 
</p>
<p>and masculinity; the gender division of labor in private and public spheres; and numer-
</p>
<p>ous institutions, practices, and structures that reinforce male dominance&mdash;even the very 
</p>
<p>idea of gender itself&mdash;are not expressions of natural differences between women and 
</p>
<p>men. Rather, gender and the gender order are socially constructed. Although there is a 
</p>
<p>fairly universal adoption of social constructionist perspectives in understanding gender, 
</p>
<p>there is considerable variation in the epistemologies, contexts, and levels of analyses of 
</p>
<p>the theories that have been developed to explain gender stratification. Feminist explana-
</p>
<p>tions not only focus on different aspects of the gender system, but they also operate at 
</p>
<p>various levels of analyses (for reviews, see Chafetz, 1988; England, 1993; Lorber, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Those theories that explicitly address the change process have tended to be macrostruc-
</p>
<p>tural and have stressed the relationship between societal level structural and cultural 
</p>
<p>processes and the level of gender inequality in a society (Blumberg, 1984; Chafetz, 1990; 
</p>
<p>Dunn, Almquist, &amp; Chafetz, 1993; Hartmann, 1984; Huber, 1991; Smith 1990). As use-</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Movements 149 
</p>
<p>ful as these perspectives might be for explaining variations in gender inequality across 
social systems, macrostructural theories are unable to explain the shifts in gender con-
sciousness and increases in resources and organization that social movements scholars 
have found to be essential for mobilization of collective action oriented toward gender 
system change (Buechler, 1990; Chafetz &amp; Dworkin, 1986; Costain, 1992; Katzenstein 
&amp; Mueller, 1987; Klein, 1984). We believe that theoretical frameworks that combine the 
insights of interactionist, network and organizational, and macrostructural gender theo-
rists by highlighting the centrality of gender at all levels of analysis (see, e.g., Collins, 
1990; Connell, 1987; Lorber, 1994; Scott, 1986) are likely to provide the most useful set 
of concepts for assessing the role of social movement actors in the social construction of 
gender. 
</p>
<p>Multilevel frameworks suggest three analytical tools for understanding the effects of 
social movements on the gender order. First, they view gender at the interactional level, 
calling our attention to the way women and men learn societal expectations of gender-
appropriate behavior and practice them in daily interactions in the performance of femi-
ninity and masculinity (Butler, 1990; Thorne, 1994; West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1995; West &amp; 
Zimmerman, 1987). Second, they delineate the way gender operates at the structural 
level, so that gender distinctions become a basis for ranking men above women of the 
same race and class (Acker, 1990; Reskin, 1988). It is in this sense that Scott (1988) 
refers to gender as "signifying power relations" (p. 42). As a structure, gender divides 
work in the home and in the wider economy, legitimates existing hierarchies of authority, 
organizes sexual expression and emotions, and structures every aspect of social life be-
cause of its embeddedness in the family, the workplace, and the state (Connell, 1987; 
Lorber, 1994). Finally, at the cultural level, gender distinctions and hierarchy are ex-
pressed in ideology and cultural practices, such as sexuality and language, as well as in 
art, religion, medicine, law, and the mass media (Butler, 1990; Smith, 1990). Treating 
the gender system as simultaneously supported and constructed at each of these levels 
allows us to recognize the myriad of ways that social movements are engaged in claims-
making to challenge or affirm the gender code. 
</p>
<p>Even if multilevel theories are more sensitive to the complexities of gender change, 
they do not offer insight into the actual processes of change. Our analysis draws upon 
social movement theory to demonstrate the link between social movement activism and 
the social construction of gender relations at these various levels. Theorists have devel-
oped complementary and competing frameworks to explain the emergence and dynamics 
of social movements. Our approach to social movements combines the insights of classi-
cal collective behavior theory, resource mobilization theory, and new social movements 
perspectives by highlighting the way grievances, ideology, and collective identity com-
bine with organization, resources, and political context to explain the emergence, nature, 
and course of movements (McAdam, 1992; McCarthy &amp; Zald, 1977; Melucci, 1989; 
Morris, 1984; Tarrow, 1994; Turner &amp; Killian, 1987). Although scholars generally agree 
on the factors that promote feminist collective action, there is debate on the relative im-
portance of grievances, consciousness, and collective identity, on the one hand, and re-
sources, political opportunity, and organizations, on the other (Buechler, 1990). 
</p>
<p>Feminist researchers have placed considerable emphasis on the importance of femi-
nist consciousness&mdash;or the belief that women are subordinated as a group on the basis of 
sex&mdash;in explaining the rise of women's movements. Nevertheless, diverse versions of 
feminism have existed and even coexisted in the same movements throughout history. To 
capture the diversity of feminism, historians have suggested that one fundamental debate </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>150 Cynthia Fabrizio Pelak ET AL. 
</p>
<p>that appears throughout the history of feminism focuses on women's "sameness" versus 
their "difference" from men (Black, 1989; Chafe, 1991; Cott, 1987; Offen, 1988; Tong, 
1989). Feminists advocating an "equal rights" position have emphasized the similarities 
between women and men and pursued policies and strategies that treat women and men 
identically. In contrast, those who argue women's "difference" hold that, either as a result 
of biology or socialization, women are essentially different from men in their capacity for 
caring and compassion. These feminists have seen the need for female-specific political 
strategies that address women's maternal role. 
</p>
<p>Although the discussion of gender ideology in feminism is fruitful, we think that a 
concentration solely on ideas ignores the fact that feminists are social movements actors 
situated within an organizational and movement context. Feminism is more than gender 
ideology: it is a collective identity. Collective identity is the shared definition of a group 
that derives from members' common interests, experiences, and solidarity (Taylor, 1989; 
Taylor &amp; Whittier, 1992). A collective identity approach allows us to understand feminist 
identity as a movement characteristic that is constructed, activated, and sustained through 
interaction in a wider social movement. 
</p>
<p>Even if feminist consciousness is an important ingredient of women's movements, a 
social movement perspective insists that we recognize that the emergence of feminist 
movements depends on the political opportunities for women to organize on their own 
behalf, the resources available to them, as well as their collective identities and interpre-
tation of their grievances. Besides these constitutive elements, social movement scholars 
recognize that there are some basic structural preconditions underlying the emergence of 
women's collective mobilization. 
</p>
<p>3. STRUCTURAL PRECONDITIONS 
OF WESTERN FEMINIST MOVEMENTS 
</p>
<p>From a movement perspective, women have always had sufficient grievances to create the 
</p>
<p>context for feminist activity. Indeed, instances of collective action on the part of women 
</p>
<p>abound in history, especially if one includes female reform societies, women's church 
</p>
<p>groups, alternative religious societies, and women's clubs. However, collective activity 
</p>
<p>on the part of women directed specifically toward improving their own status has flour-
</p>
<p>ished primarily during periods of generalized social upheaval, when sensitivity to moral 
</p>
<p>injustice, discrimination, and social inequality has been widespread in the society as a 
</p>
<p>whole (Chafe, 1977; Staggenborg, 1998). The first wave of feminism in the United States 
</p>
<p>grew out of the abolitionist struggle of the 1830s and peaked during an era of social 
</p>
<p>reform in the 1890s, and the contemporary movement emerged out of the general social 
</p>
<p>discontent of the 1960s. Although the women's movement did not die between these 
</p>
<p>periods of heightened activism, it declined sharply in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s after 
</p>
<p>the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing women the 
</p>
<p>right to vote as a response to the changing social, political, and economic context (Rupp 
</p>
<p>&amp; Taylor, 1987). During this period, women who had played important roles in obtaining 
</p>
<p>women's suffrage managed to keep the flames of feminism alive by launching a cam-
</p>
<p>paign to pass an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>Researchers identify crucial structural conditions that underlie the emergence of 
</p>
<p>feminist protest (Chafetz &amp; Dworkin, 1986; Huber &amp; Spitze, 1983; Oppenheimer, 1973). 
</p>
<p>Broad societal changes in the patterns of women's participation in the paid labor force. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Movements 151 
</p>
<p>increases in women's formal educational attainment, and shifts in women's fertility rates 
and reproductive roles disrupt traditional social arrangements and set the stage for women's 
movements. Chafetz and Dworkin (1986) propose that as industrialization and urbaniza-
tion bring greater education for women, expanding public responsibilities create role and 
status conflicts for middle-class women, who then develop the discontent and gender 
consciousness necessary for political action. Specifically, when women, especially mar-
ried middle-class women, enter the paid labor force their gender consciousness increases 
because they are more likely to use men as a reference group when assessing their access 
to societal rewards. Similarly, women often experience strains and discrepancies in their 
lives as their gender consciousness is raised through formal education (Klein, 1984). 
</p>
<p>Scholars also identify other important structural preconditions that set the stage for 
feminist mobilization, including changes in family relationships, marriage, fertility, and 
sexual mores (Ferree &amp; Hess, 1994). Declines in women's childbearing rates and increas-
ing age of women at first marriage can positively influence women's educational attain-
ment and participation in the paid labor force which, in turn, raises women's gender 
consciousness (Klein, 1984). Moreover, changes in the traditional relationships between 
women and men in marriage and in sexual mores, such as the shift from authoritarian 
marriages to romantic or companionate marriages at the turn of the century in the United 
States and the "sexual revolution" of the 1960s, can politize gender relations and create 
the motivations for feminist mobilization (Ferree &amp; Hess, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Structural preconditions underlying the genesis of feminist collective mobilizations 
vary with historical and geographical context. Not only the political context but also the 
structural preconditions underlying feminist mobilizations in the United States are dif-
ferent from those in Third World countries. Moreover, variable structural conditions in-
fluence the ideologies, organizations, and strategies adopted by feminist movements in 
different times and places. Nonetheless, scholars recognize some important commonal-
ties between women's movements around the world.

<p>4. FEMINIST MOVEMENTS IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT 
</p>
<p>While this chapter focuses on the women's movement in the United States, it is nonethe-
</p>
<p>less important to acknowledge the multiple forms of feminist resistance around the world 
</p>
<p>and to underscore the importance of the historical and geographical specificity of femi-
</p>
<p>nist activism. Throughout modern history, women in all regions of the world have orga-
</p>
<p>nized collectively against the injustice and oppression in their lives and communities 
</p>
<p>(Basu, 1995). Such mobilizations in diverse political, cultural, and historical contexts 
</p>
<p>have varied widely in their organizations, strategies, ideologies, and structures. Gender 
</p>
<p>oppression for some Third World feminists cannot be divorced from issues and histories 
</p>
<p>of colonization, immigration, racism, or imperialism, and thus feminist activism in some 
</p>
<p>Third World contexts may be organized around a constellation of oppressions rather than 
</p>
<p>specifically around gender oppression (Jayawardena, 1986; Mohanty, Russo, &amp; Torres, 
</p>
<p>1991). In some instances, however, ideological, organizational, and strategic differences 
</p>
<p>in women's movements cannot be said to lie in the lived experiences of women but in 
</p>
<p>fundamental differences in the political culture of a region (Ray, 1999). In Calcutta, In-
</p>
<p>dia, for example, which is dominated by the Communist Party and a strong and tradi-
</p>
<p>tional left culture, the women's movement functions more as a political party and uses 
</p>
<p>strategies to address issues such as work and domestic violence that do not direcUy threaten </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>the gender status quo. The women's movement in Bombay, on the other hand, which 
exists in a more open, contested political field and culture, is characterized by more 
autonomous forms of organizing and has been influenced by American feminists' analy-
ses of domestic violence and British socialist feminist analyses of class. Although differ-
ences exist, researchers nevertheless have identified important commonalties that link 
women's movements over time and place (Chafetz &amp; Dworkin, 1986; Giele, 1995; 
Katzenstein &amp; Mueller, 1987; Miles, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Some scholars recognize that women's movements, particularly those in industrial-
ized countries, generally have emerged in two waves of heightened activism. In their 
cross-cultural, historical analysis of 48 countries, Chafetz and Dworkin (1986) found 
that the mass-scale, independent women's movements of the first wave, such as those in 
European societies and the United States, occurred in the closing decades of the nine-
teenth century and the first decades of the twentieth century, while the second wave women's 
movements emerged since the 1960s. Major goals of the first wave of activism included 
women's suffrage, educational opportunities for women, basic legal reforms, inheritance 
and property rights, and employment opportunities for women. Chafetz and Dworkin 
(1986) maintain that women's demands during this first wave often were framed around 
middle-class women's roles as wives and mothers and reinforced gender difference by 
valorizing women's special virtues and moral superiority over men. Smaller scale move-
ments during the first wave were more likely to challenge basic role differentiation be-
tween women and men and to resist doctrines and images of femininity in the culture. To 
the extent that the large-scale changes brought on by urbanization and industrialization 
in Western countries created dramatic changes in the workplace, the family, and in the 
lives of women and men, it is not surprising there was considerable ideological debate 
and diversity among first wave feminists. In the United States, for example, some factions 
of the nineteenth-century women's movement, which merged in 1890 to form the Na-
tional American Woman Suffrage Association, were grounded in essentialist views of sex 
differences and were more interested in nonfeminist social reforms for which the vote was 
only a prerequisite (Buechler, 1990; Giele, 1995). Other branches of the nineteenth-cen-
tury women's movement rejected essentialist notions of gender and, by pursuing more radical 
changes such as sexual freedom and the expansion of women's roles in the workplace and 
politics, sought to transform the gender order in more fundamental ways (Cott, 1987). 
</p>
<p>Women's movements of the second wave in Western countries, blossoming since the 
1960s, have mobilized around an even broader range of issues, such as reproductive 
rights, sexual and economic exploitation, and violence against women (Chafetz &amp; Dworkin, 
1986; Ferree &amp; Hess, 1994). Modern feminist movements often have developed out of 
women's commonalties; however, feminist scholars increasingly emphasize that differ-
ences of race, class, ethnicity, and nationality are also expressed in the collective identi-
ties deployed by feminists (Mohanty et al., 1991; Moraga &amp; Anzaldua, 1981). Collins 
(1990) maintains that African-American women have organized around interlocking struc-
tures of oppression that affect women in different ways depending on, for instance, their 
race, class, or sexual identities. For example, African-American and Latina women from 
low-income urban neighborhoods have struggled for quality education, affordable and 
safe housing, and expanded childcare services for their families and communities (Naples, 
1992b). Naples characterizes these mobilizations as instances of "activist mothering," 
and she demonstrates that women's collective identities derive from the multiple and 
interlocking systems of race and class and are justified by the belief that "good mother-
ing" includes nurturing practices, political activism, and community work. </p>

<p>Gender Movements 153 
</p>
<p>Although there is debate about the definition of feminism around the world, it is 
difficult to deny that since the late 1960s there has been an enormous growth of feminist 
activity all over the globe. Some scholars argue that large independent women's move-
ments during this period occurred primarily in Western industrial societies and that femi-
nist movement activity was limited, in part, by the large number of repressive political 
regimes around the world that efficiently suppressed feminist activity (Chafetz &amp; Dworkin, 
1986). Other scholars use a broader definition of what constitutes a women's movement 
and conclude that feminist resistance during this period was and still is extremely wide-
spread (Basu, 1995; Jayawardena, 1986; Miles, 1996; Mohanty et al , 1991). 
</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, there has been a phenomenal growth of regional, interregional, and 
international networking between feminist groups (Miles, 1996), although the origins of 
international women's organizations date back to the closing decades of the nineteenth 
century (Rupp, 1997). The United Nations' International Women's Year (1975) and De-
cade for Women (1975-1985) helped foster global feminist dialogues and stimulated in-
dependent, locally based feminist activities in all parts of the world. Since the beginning 
of the U.N. Decade for Women there have been four "official" U.N. conferences of gov-
ernment representatives devoted to women's issues. Four "unofficial" forums of women's 
groups and feminists from around the world have occurred simultaneously with these 
"official" conferences. Since the first forum in Mexico City in 1975, participation by 
women in the "unofficial" forums has increased sharply, challenging the notion that femi-
nism has died in recent years. Although these conferences and forums have been sites of 
considerable debate and conflict over the meaning of "women's issues" and the definition 
of feminism, the events have sparked multiple forms and foci of feminist resistance and a 
global awareness of women's oppression that reaches beyond women's groups. 
</p>
<p>Other examples of international feminist networks, events, and organizations in-
clude the International Tribunal of Crimes against Women held in Brussels in 1976; 
Development Alternative with Women for a New Era (DAWN), an international organi-
zation of Third World feminist-activist researchers formed in 1984; the Women's Inter-
national Tribunal and Meeting on Reproductive Rights in 1984 in Amsterdam; and the 
Network on Women's Rights Are Human Rights founded in 1991 (Miles, 1996). Through 
these and other countless networks and organizations, feminists are forging global rela-
tions around a diverse set of issues, including "health, housing, education, law reform, 
population, human rights, reproductive and genetic engineering, female sexual slavery 
and trafficking in women, violence against women, spirituality, peace and militarism, 
external debt, fundamentalism, environment, development, media, alternative technol-
ogy, film, art and literature, publishing, and women's studies" (Miles, 1996, p. 142). 
Scholars of international feminism, such as Raca Ray (1999), contend that, despite varia-
tion in women's movements around the world, through international conferences the 
ideology and practice of radical feminism in the United States has left its mark on femi-
nism globally. 
</p>
<p>Accompanying the burgeoning of international feminist networks, there has been a 
growing global awareness among feminist movements around the world since the 1970s. 
Scholars of international feminism, such as Agnes Miles (1996), go so far as to suggest 
that within the context of broad globalization processes, women's groups in all regions 
are more often acting locally while thinking globally. Without ignoring the tensions among 
feminists from different parts of the world, such as those between the North and the 
South, and conflicts among feminists from the same region, such as disputes between 
white women and women of color in the United States (Leidner, 1993) and between East </p>

</p>
<p>and West German women in postunification Germany (Ferree, 1997), Miles contends 
that there is an emerging feminist global vision in which diversity and specificity are 
embraced rather than seen as essentially contradictory. Within this emerging global vi-
sion, some feminists are working to build theory and practice that understands the op-
pression in women's lives as deeply connected with other forms, structures, and manifes-
tations of oppression. As such, feminist concerns about reproductive freedoms are not 
divorced from ecological issues or from the historical processes of colonization. Although 
much of the feminist scholarship on women's movements is focused on the development 
of women's movements in the United States or European societies, the feminist literature 
on women's movements in non-Western societies and the global feminist movement is 
expanding rapidly (see Miles, 1996 and Mohanty et al., 1991 for detailed bibliographies). 
The trajectory of the U.S. women's movement can be understood only in this global con-
text. 
</p>
<p>5. THE CONTEMPORARY FEMINIST MOVEMENT: 
</p>
<p>CONTINUITY AND CHANGE 
</p>
<p>Of all the manifestations of social activism in the 1960s in the United States, feminism is 
</p>
<p>one of the few that continued to flourish in the 1970s and 1980s and remains active in the 
</p>
<p>1990s. Although feminism has changed form in the late 1980s and 1990s, neither the 
</p>
<p>movement nor the injustices that produced it have vanished. We trace here the interrela-
</p>
<p>tionships among the ideologies, organizational structures, changing political context, 
</p>
<p>and strategies of the most recent wave of the U.S. women's movement. 
Most scholarly analyses of the women's movement of the late 1960s&mdash;what scholars 
</p>
<p>call the "new feminist movement"&mdash;divide it into two wings, with origins in the griev-
ances and preexisting organizations of two groups of women: older professional women 
who created bureaucratic organizations with a liberal ideology and adopted legal reform 
strategies, and younger women from the civil rights and New Left movements who formed 
small collective organizations with radical ideology and employed "personal as political" 
strategies such as consciousness-raising groups (Buechler, 1990; Cassell, 1977; Ferree &amp; 
Hess, 1985; Freeman, 1975). 
</p>
<p>The ideologies, organizations, and strategies developed by these two factions have 
not, however, remained separate and distinct since the 1970s. The contemporary wave of 
feminist activism can be divided into three stages: resurgence (1966-1971), the feminist 
heyday (1972-1982), and abeyance (1983 to the present). Scholars generally date the 
feminist resurgence to the founding of the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 
1966 (Buechler, 1990; Ryan, 1992). During the resurgence period, the movement estab-
lished itself, forming organizations and ideologies and moving into the public eye. By 
1971, major segments of feminism had crystallized: liberal feminism, embodied in the 
formation of groups such as NOW, the Women's Equity Action League (WEAL) in 1967, 
and the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC) in 1971; radical feminism and so-
cialist feminism, emerging from consciousness raising groups, theory groups, and small 
action groups such as Redstockings and the Feminists in 1969; and lesbian feminism, 
organized in such groups as Radicalesbians in 1970 and the Furies (initially called "Those 
Women") in 1971 (Echols, 1989). 
</p>
<p>The year 1972 was pivotal both for the movement's success and for its opposition. 
The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) passed in Congress, and Phyllis Schafly launched </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Movements 155 
</p>
<p>her first attacks, signifying the transition to a second phase of feminist activism that 
lasted until the defeat of the ERA in 1982 (Mansbridge, 1986). While some authors argue 
that this period saw a decline in the women's movement and a retreat from radicalism 
(Echols 1989), we think it should be considered the movement's heyday because the 
feminist revolution seemed to be on the move. The campaign to ratify the ERA in the 
states brought mass mobilization, fostering female solidarity and enlisting women into 
feminism, women's studies programs proliferated on college campuses, the number and 
variety of feminist organizations increased phenomenally, and the movement entered the 
political arena and encountered active opposition (Matthews &amp; DeHart, 1990; Ryan, 1992). 
Not only did feminism flourish in the ratification campaign, it spread into the political 
mainstream while radical and lesbian feminist organizing heightened outside it. 
</p>
<p>Following the ERA'S defeat in 1982, the women's movement entered a period of the 
doldrums, in which it has developed new structural forms to survive a shrinking member-
ship and an increasingly nonreceptive environment. The 1980s saw a turning away from 
the values of equality, human rights, and social justice and even a deliberate backlash 
against the feminist momentum of the 1970s. Rights won by feminists in the 1960s and 
1970s&mdash;from affirmative action to legal abortion&mdash;have been under siege throughout the 
1980s and 1990s. Yet the 1980s and 1990s are not the first hostile period in which femi-
nism has endured. In the period following World War II, when strict gender roles and 
social and political conservatism flourished, the women's movement adopted a tightknit 
structure that enabled it to survive (Rupp &amp; Taylor, 1987; Taylor, 1989). The so-called 
"postfeminist" era of the 1980s and 1990s no more marks the death of the women's 
movement than did the 1950s. 
</p>
<p>5.1. Feminist Ideology 
</p>
<p>Although ideas do not necessarily cause social movements, social movement theorists 
identify ideology as a central component of any social movement (Morris &amp; Mueller, 
1992). The new feminist movement, like most social movements, is not ideologically 
monolithic. Feminist ideology encompasses numerous ideological strands that differ in 
the scope of change sought; the extent to which gender inequality is linked to other 
systems of domination, especially class, race/ethnicity, and sexuality; and the signifi-
cance attributed to gender differences. We focus here on the evolution of the dominant 
ideologies that have motivated participants in the two major branches of the new feminist 
movement from its inception, liberal feminism and radical feminism. 
</p>
<p>The first wave of the women's movement in the nineteenth century was, by and 
large, a liberal feminist reform movement. It sought equality within the existing social 
structure and, indeed, in many ways functioned like other reform movements to reaffirm 
existing values within the society (Ferree &amp; Hess, 1985). Nineteenth-century feminists 
believed that if they obtained the right to an education, the right to own property, the right 
to vote, employment rights&mdash;in other words, equal civil rights under the law&mdash;they would 
attain equality with men. Scholars have labeled this thinking "individualist" or "equity" 
feminism, linking the goal of equal rights to gender assumptions about women's basic 
sameness with men (Black, 1989; Offen, 1988). 
</p>
<p>The basic ideas identified with contemporary liberal or "mainstream" feminism have 
changed little since their formulation in the nineteenth century when they seemed pro-
gressive, even radical (Eisenstein, 1981). Contemporary liberal feminist ideology holds </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>156 Cynthia Fabrizio Pelak ET AL. 
</p>
<p>that women lack power simply because women as a group are not allowed equal opportu-
nity to compete and succeed in the male-dominated economic and political arenas but, 
instead, are relegated to the subordinate world of home, domestic labor, motherhood, and 
family. The major strategy for change is to gain legal and economic equalities and to 
obtain access to elite positions in the workplace and in politics. Thus, liberal feminists 
tend to place as much emphasis on changing individual women as they do on changing 
society. For instance, teaching women managerial skills or instructing rape victims in 
"survival" strategies strikes a blow at gender social definitions that channel women into 
traditionally feminine occupations and passive behaviors that make them easy targets of 
aggression by men. As several scholars have noted, liberal feminism ironically provided 
ideological support through the 1970s and 1980s for the massive transformation in work 
and family life that was occurring as the United States underwent the transition to a 
postindustrial order (Mitchell, 1986; Stacey, 1987). Some writers even contend that by 
urging women to enter the workplace and adopt a male orientation, the equal opportunity 
approach to feminism unwittingly contributed to a host of problems that further disad-
vantaged women, especially working-class women and women of color, including the 
rise in divorce rates, the "feminization" of working-class occupations, and the devalua-
tion of motherhood and traditional female characteristics (Gordon, 1991). 
</p>
<p>Radical feminist ideology dates to Simone de Beauvoir's early 1950s theory of "sex 
class," which was developed further in the late 1960s among small groups of radical 
women who fought the subordination of women's liberation within the New Left (Beauvoir, 
1952; Daly, 1978; Firestone, 1970; Griffin, 1978; MacKinnon, 1982, 1983; Millett, 1971; 
Rich, 1976, 1980). The radical approach recognizes women's identity and subordination 
as a "sex class," emphasizes women's fundamental difference from men, views gender as 
the primary contradiction and foundation for the unequal distribution of a society's re-
wards and privileges, and recasts relations between women and men in political terms 
(Echols, 1989). Defining women as a "sex class" means no longer treating patriarchy in 
individual terms but acknowledging the social and structural nature of women's subordi-
nation. Radical feminists hold that in all societies, institutions, and social patterns are 
structured to maintain and perpetuate gender inequality and that female disadvantage 
permeates virtually all aspects of sociocultural and personal life. Further, through the 
gender division of labor, social institutions are linked so that male superiority depends 
upon female subordination (Hartmann, 1981). In the United States, as in most industrial-
ized societies, power, prestige, and wealth accrue to those who control the distribution of 
resources outside the home in the economic and political spheres. The sexual division of 
labor that assigns childcare and domestic responsibilities to women not only ensures 
gender inequality in the dominant family system but perpetuates male advantage in po-
litical and economic institutions as well. 
</p>
<p>To unravel the complex structure on which gender inequality rests requires, from a 
radical feminist perspective, a fundamental transformation of all institutions in society. 
To meet this challenge, radical feminists formulated influential critiques of the family, 
marriage, love, motherhood, heterosexuality, sexual violence, capitalism, reproductive 
policies, the media, science, language and culture, the beauty industry, sports, politics 
and the law, and technology. Radical feminism's ultimate vision is revolutionary in scope: 
a fundamentally new social order that eliminates the sex-class system and replaces it with 
new ways&mdash;based on women's difference&mdash;of defining and structuring experience. Cen-
tral to the development of radical feminist ideology was the strategy of forming small 
groups for the purpose of "consciousness-raising." Pioneered initially among New Left </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Movements 157 
</p>
<p>women, consciousness-raising can be understood as a kind of conversion in which women 
come to view experiences previously thought of as personal and individual, such as sexual 
exploitation or employment discrimination, as social problems that are the result of gen-
der inequality. 
</p>
<p>By the late 1970s, the distinction between liberal and radical feminism was becom-
ing less clear (Garden, 1978; Whittier, 1995). Ideological shifts took place at both the 
individual and organizational levels. Participation in liberal feminist reform and service 
organizations working on such issues as rape, battering, abortion, legal and employment 
discrimination, and women's health problems raised women's consciousness, increased 
their feminist activism, and contributed to their radicalization as they came to see con-
nections between these issues and the larger system of gender inequality (Schlesinger &amp; 
Bart, 1983; Whittier, 1995). Women were also radicalized by working through their own 
personal experiences of sexual harassment, divorce, rape, abortion, and incest (Huber, 
1973; Klein, 1984). 
</p>
<p>Radicalization has also occurred at the group level. By the end of the 1970s, liberal 
feminist organizations, such as NOW, the Women's Legal Defense Fund, and the Na-
tional Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL), which had been pursuing equality within 
the law, began to adopt strategies and goals consistent with a more radical stance. NOW 
included in its 1979 objectives not only such legal strategies as the ERA and reproductive 
choice, but also broader issues such as the threat of nuclear energy to the survival of the 
species, lesbian and gay rights, homemakers' rights, the exploitation of women in the 
home, and sex-segregation in the workplace (Eisenstein, 1981). Even the ERA, which 
sought equality for women within the existing legal and economic structure, was based 
on the fact that women are discriminated against as a "sex class" (Mansbridge, 1986). 
</p>
<p>Beginning in the mid-1980s, with the defeat of the unifying issue of the ERA and 
the growing diversification of the movement, feminist ideology deemphasized the ques-
tion of women's sameness or difference from men in favor of "deconstructing" the term 
"woman." Women of color, Jewish women, lesbians, and working-class women chal-
lenged radical feminists' idea of a "sex class" that implied a distinctive and essential 
female condition. Since women are distributed throughout all social classes, racial and 
ethnic groupings, sexual communities, cultures, and religions, disadvantage for women 
varies and is multidimensional (Spelman, 1988). The recognition that the circumstances 
of women's oppression differ has given way to a new feminist paradigm that views race, 
class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality as interlocking systems of oppression, forming 
what Patricia Hill Collins (1990) refers to as a "matrix of domination." 
</p>
<p>Some scholars have charged that focusing on women's differences from one another 
has resulted in a retreat to "identity politics" and the demise of the women's movement. 
Alice Echols (1989) links disputes over difference and a focus on identity to a concentra-
tion on building an alternative women's culture rather than confronting and changing 
social institutions. In a similar vein, Barbara Ryan (1989) argues that internal debates 
over the correctness of competing feminist theories and the political implications of per-
sonal choices&mdash;what she terms "ideological purity"&mdash;tore the women's movement apart. 
But other scholars see the sometimes vehement arguments over women's differences from 
one another as a sign of life (Taylor &amp; Rupp, 1993). Feminists organizing around diverse 
identities sometimes seek out new arenas of challenge that differ from traditional defini-
tions of political activism and thus extend the reach of feminism. Self-help movements 
focused on the self and the body&mdash;for example, drug and alcohol abuse, incest, postpar-
tum depression, battering, breast cancer&mdash;offer a complex challenge to traditional no-</p>

</p>
<p>tions of femininity, motherhood, and sexuality and carry the potential to mobilize new 
constituencies (Gagn^, 1998; Taylor &amp; Van Willigen, 1996). 
</p>
<p>In any case, ideas alone are an incomplete explanation of either the direction or the 
consequences of a social movement (Marx &amp; Wood, 1975; McCarthy &amp; Zald, 1977). 
Much depends on a movement's structures and strategies, as well as on the larger politi-
cal context. 
</p>
<p>5.2. Feminist Organizational Structures 
</p>
<p>Social movements do not generally have a single, central organization or unified direc-
tion. Rather, the structure of any general and broad-based social movement is more dif-
fuse in that it is composed of a number of relatively independent organizations that differ 
in ideology, structure, goals, and tactics, is characterized by decentralized leadership; 
and is loosely connected by multiple and overlapping memberships, friendship networks, 
and cooperation in working toward common goals (Gerlach &amp; Hine, 1970). The organi-
zational structure of the new feminist movement has conformed to this model from its 
beginnings (Cassell, 1977; Ferree &amp; Martin, 1995; Freeman, 1975). While the movement 
as a whole is characterized by a decentralized structure, the various organizations that 
comprise it vary widely in structure. The diversity of feminist organizational forms re-
flects both ideological differences and, as Freeman (1979) points out, the movement's 
diverse membership base. 
</p>
<p>There have been two main types of organizational structure in the new feminist 
movement since its resurgence, reflecting the two sources of feminist organizing in the 
late 1960s: bureaucratically structured movement organizations with hierarchical leader-
ship and democratic decision-making procedures, such as NOW; and smaller, collec-
tively structured groups that formed a more diffuse social movement community held 
together by a feminist political culture. The smaller groups must be understood as what 
Joan Acker (1990) has termed "gendered" organizations. Collectively organized groups, 
at least in theory, strove to exemplify a better way of structuring society by constructing a 
distinctive women's culture that valorized egalitarianism, the expression of emotion, and 
the sharing of personal experience. It is important to recognize, however, that while the 
two strands of the women's movement emerged separately, they have not remained dis-
tinct and opposed to each other, and in any case most organizations were mixed in form 
from the outset. The two structures have increasingly converged as bureaucratic organi-
zations adopted some of the innovations of collectivism and feminist collectives became 
more formally structured (Ferree &amp; Martin, 1995; Martin, 1990; Ryan, 1992; Staggenborg, 
1988, 1989; Whittier, 1995). In addition, many individual activists are involved in a 
variety of organizations with differing structures. 
</p>
<p>The bureaucratically structured and professionalized movement organizations ini-
tially adopted by liberal groups such as NOW were well suited to work within the simi-
larly structured political arena and to members' previous experience in professional orga-
nizations. The structures that radical feminist groups initially adopted, on the other hand, 
built on their prior involvement experiences in the New Left (Evans, 1979). Collectivist 
organizations grew from radical feminists' attempt to structure relations among mem-
bers, processes of decision making, and group leadership in a way that reflected or prefig-
ured the values and goals of the movement (Breines, 1982; Rothschild-Whitt, 1979). 
Feminist collectivist organizations made decisions by consensus, rotated leadership and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Movements 159 
</p>
<p>Other tasks among members, and shared skills to avoid hierarchy and specialization. As 
Jo Freeman (1972/1973) and others have noted, such groups often failed to meet their 
ideals and did, in fact, spawn unacknowledged hierarchies. Nevertheless, the conscious 
effort to build a feminist collective structure has had a lasting impact on the women's 
movement and has led to the growth of what Steven Buechler (1990) calls a social move-
ment community. 
</p>
<p>Buechler proposes that movements consist not only of formal organizations, but that 
they also include more informally organized communities, made up of networks of people 
who share the movement's political goals and outlook and work toward common aims. 
The coUectivist branch of the women's movement initially sparked the growth of a femi-
nist social movement community in which alternative structures guided by a distinctively 
feminist women's culture flourished&mdash;including bookstores, theater groups, music col-
lectives, poetry groups, art collectives, publishing and recording companies, spirituality 
groups, vacation resorts, self-help groups, and a variety of feminist-run businesses. This 
"women's culture," although it includes feminists of diverse political persuasions, has 
been largely maintained by lesbian feminists in the 1980s and 1990s. It nurtures a femi-
nist collective identity that is important to the survival of the women's movement as a 
whole (Taylor &amp; Rupp, 1993; Taylor &amp; Whittier, 1992). 
</p>
<p>Both bureaucratic organizations working within mainstream politics and the alter-
native feminist culture have expanded and converged since the movement's emergence in 
the 1960s. Organizations such as NOW and the NARAL incorporated some of the inno-
vations of collectivism, including consciousness-raising groups, modified consensus de-
cision-making, and the use of direct action tactics and civil disobedience. A host of struc-
tural variations emerged, including formally structured groups that use consensus 
decision-making, organizations with deliberately democratic structures, and groups that 
officially operate by majority-rule democracy but in practice make most decisions by con-
sensus (Martin, 1990; Ryan, 1992; Staggenborg, 1988, 1989; Taylor, 1996). At the same 
time, feminist collectives shifted their focus from consciousness-raising and radical femi-
nist critique to the development of feminist self-help and service organizations, such as 
rape crisis centers, shelters for battered women, job training programs for displaced home-
makers, and lesbian peer counseling groups. Moreover, many feminist collectives revised 
their structure to depend less on consensus decision-making and to permit specialization 
of skills. Feminist anti-rape groups received financial support from government agencies 
and private foundations to provide rape prevention and treatment services in public schools 
and universities (Matthews, 1994). The widespread acceptance of the feminist analysis of 
rape as an act of violence and power rather than a strictly sexual act attest to the impact of 
the feminist anti-rape movement. The distinction between "working outside the system" 
and "working within the system," so important in the late 1960s, no longer had the same 
significance. 
</p>
<p>In conjunction with the ideological shift from a universal to a differentiated category 
of "woman," the structures of the women's movement diversified as well. Although indi-
vidual women of color and working-class women had participated in the founding of 
NOW and in the early protests against sexism in the civil rights movement, the women's 
movement attracted primarily white middle-class women. Not that women of color and 
working-class or poor women experienced no oppression as women or opposed feminist 
goals. A 1989 New York Times/CBS News poll revealed that, whereas only 64% of white 
women saw a need for a women's movement, 85% of African-American women and 76% 
of Hispanic women thought the women's movement was needed (Sapiro, 1991). Yet the </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>feminist movement remained predominantly white both because of the continuation of its 
tradition of defining its goals with an eye to the concerns of white middle-class women 
and because many black women and other women of color place a priority on working 
with men of their own communities to advance their collective interests. Independent 
organizing by women of color did occur during the 1970s, and when African-American 
activists in the women's movement formed the National Black Feminist Organization in 
1973 it grew to a membership of 1000 within its first year (Deckard, 1983). In the 1980s 
and 1990s independent feminist organizations and networks of women of color, such as 
the National Black Women's Health Project and the National Coalition of 100 Black 
Women, emerged. Women of color also formed active caucuses within predominantly 
white feminist organizations, such as the National Women's Studies Association, to work 
against racism within the women's movement (Leidner, 1993). Likewise, Jewish women, 
who had historically played important roles within the women's movement, began to 
organize their own groups in the 1980s and speak out against anti-Semitism within the 
movement (Beck, 1980; Bulkin, Pratt, &amp; Smith, 1984). 
</p>
<p>Union women played a significant role in the formation of NOW in 1966 by provid-
ing office space and clerical services, until NOW's endorsement of the ERA in 1967 
forced the women of the United Auto Workers, an organization that at the time opposed 
the ERA, to withdraw such support. Women committed to both feminism and the union 
movement, like women of color, formed their own organization, the Coalition of Labor 
Union Women (CLUW), in 1974 (Balser, 1987). CLUW claimed 16,000 members by 
1982 and had made progress in its fight to win AFL-CIO support for feminist issues. 
Union women also participated in deeply gendered ways in labor movement activity such 
as the 1985 Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel strike, both affirming and challenging gender 
(Fonow, 1998). The basic class and race composition of the movement may have changed 
little throughout the 1970s and 1980s, but as Buechler (1990, p. 158) put it, "A move-
ment that began as unconsciously class-bound and race-bound has now become con-
sciously class-bound and race-bound." 
</p>
<p>Collective action by the women's movement has both created new institutions and 
moved into almost every major institution of our society. However, in direct proportion to 
the successes of the women's movement, a countermovement, as we shall see, success-
fully reversed some feminist gains, stalled progress on others, and changed the face of the 
women's movement. 
</p>
<p>5.3. The Antifeminist Political Context 
</p>
<p>The early 1980s saw a rapid decrease in the number of feminist organizations and a 
</p>
<p>transformation in the form and activities of the women's movement. In part, this was a 
</p>
<p>response to the successes of the New Right: so powerful were antifeminist sentiments and 
</p>
<p>forces that members of the Republican party were elected in 1980 on a platform devel-
</p>
<p>oped explicitly to "put women back in their place." After 40 years of faithful support of 
</p>
<p>the ERA, the Republican party dropped it from its platform, called for a constitutional 
</p>
<p>amendment to ban abortion, and aligned itself with the economic and social policies of 
</p>
<p>the New Right. After the election of the conservative Reagan administration in 1980, 
</p>
<p>federal funds and grants were rarely available to feminist service organizations, and be-
</p>
<p>cause other social service organizations were also hard hit by budget cuts, competition 
</p>
<p>increased for relatively scarce money from private foundations. As a result, many femi-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Movements 161 
</p>
<p>nist programs, such as rape crisis centers, shelters for battered women, abortion clinics, 
and job training programs were forced to end or limit their services. 
</p>
<p>The failure of the ERA in 1982 seemed to reflect the changed political climate, 
setting the stage for other setbacks throughout the 1980s. Abortion rights, won in 1973 
with the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, were curtailed in 1989 by the Supreme 
Court's decision in Webster v. Reproductive Services permitting states to enact restric-
tions on abortion (Staggenborg, 1991, pp. 137-138). Following the Webster decision, 
state governments set increasingly tight restrictions on abortion, ranging from "informed 
consent" laws that required a waiting period before women could have abortions, to pa-
rental consent laws for underage women, to outright bans on abortion unless the woman's 
life was in danger. In 1991, the Supreme Court further limited abortion rights by ruling 
that federally funded family planning clinics could be barred from providing information 
on abortion. The anti-abortion movement also escalated and hardened its tactics in the 
late 1980s: it bombed abortion clinics, picketed doctors who performed abortions, and 
attempted to dissuade women entering clinics from having abortions (Simonds, 1996; 
Staggenborg, 1991). Further, Women's Studies programs in colleges and universities, 
which had been established in the 1970s in response to feminist agitation, came under 
attack by conservatives in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A backlash against 
"multiculturalism" and "political correctness" in academia sought to restore the tradi-
tional academic focus on the "great thinkers" of Western European history, and thus to 
maintain the primacy of white male perspectives and experiences. Joining the attack, 
feminists such as Camille Paglia, Katie Roiphe, and Elizabeth Fox-Genovese drew media 
attention by holding radical and lesbian feminists responsible for alienating mainstream 
women and men from the women's movement. 
</p>
<p>The women's movement suffered not only from such attacks, but also from its appar-
ent success. Overt opposition to the feminist movement had been muted in the mid- to 
late 1970s. Elites in politics, education, and industry gave the appearance of supporting 
feminist aims through largely ineffectual affirmative action programs and the appoint-
ment of a few token women to high positions in their respective areas. Meanwhile, the 
popular image of feminism advanced by the mass media suggested that the women's 
movement had won its goals, making feminism an anachronism. Despite the real-life 
difficulties women encountered trying to balance paid employment and a "second shift" 
of housework and childcare (Hochschild, 1989), the image of the working woman be-
came the feminine ideal. The public discourse implied that since women had already 
achieved equality with men, they no longer needed a protest movement, unless they hap-
pened to be lesbians and man haters. Both popular and scholarly writers, in short, de-
clared the 1980s and 1990s a "post-feminist" era. 
</p>
<p>But the women's movement did not die. Rather, it went into abeyance in order to 
survive in a hostile political climate. Movements in abeyance are in a holding pattern, 
during which activists from an earlier period maintain the ideology and structural base of 
the movement, but few new recruits join (Taylor, 1989). A movement in abeyance is 
primarily oriented toward maintaining itself rather than confronting the established or-
der directly. Focusing on building an alternative culture, for example, is a means of sur-
viving when external resources are not available and the political structure is not ame-
nable to challenge. The structure and strategies of the women's movement have changed, 
then, as mass mobilization has declined and opposition to feminism has swelled. Never-
theless, feminist resistance continues in different forms. </p>

</p>
<p>5.4. Multiple Strategies and the Challenge to Gender 
</p>
<p>Patricia Hill Collins suggests that gender resistance, challenge, and change can occur at 
three levels: the individual level of consciousness and interactions, the social structural 
level, and the cultural level (1990, p. 227). This conceptualization allows us to recognize 
that movements adopt many strategies and to acknowledge the important role of women's 
movements in the reconstruction of gender. 
</p>
<p>5.4.1. RESISTING GENDER PRACTICES. It is well established that the dominant gender 
order is created and maintained, in part, through the everyday practices of individuals 
who give gender meaning through the constant and contentious process of engendering 
behavior as separate and unequal (Butler, 1990; Chodorow, 1995; West &amp; Zimmerman, 
1987). At the level of consciousness and social interactions, individual women can and 
do resist norms and expectations of the dominant gender system (Thorne, 1995). It is, 
however, social movements or collectivities rather than isolated individuals, who per-
form the critical role of refashioning the gender code and calling institutions to account 
for gender inequality (Chafetz, 1990; Connell, 1987; Huber, 1976). One of the primary 
goals of the new feminist movement has been to change the unequal power relations 
between women and men. A general strategy used by feminists to achieve this goal has 
been to resist and challenge sexist practices within a diverse set of social contexts, rang-
ing from heterosexual marriage to the gender division of labor in rearing and nurturing 
children to the workplace and medical establishment. 
</p>
<p>The formation of consciousness-raising groups facilitated the process of resisting 
and challenging gender practices and politicizing everyday life. Because consciousness-
raising enables women to view the "personal as political," for most women it is an iden-
tity-altering experience. Becoming a feminist can transform a woman's entire self-con-
cept and way of life: her biography, appearance, beliefs, behavior, and relationships (Cassell, 
1977; Esterberg, 1997). As women's consciousness changes through personalized politi-
cal strategies such as consciousness-raising, women individually and collectively defy 
normative role expectations for women and, in so doing, reconstruct interpersonal rela-
tionships between women and men. 
</p>
<p>Women active in the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s continue to shape 
their lives in the 1980s and 1990s around their feminist beliefs, even when they are not 
involved in organized feminist activity. Many hold jobs in government, social service 
organizations, or Women's Studies and other academic programs that allow them to in-
corporate their political goals into their work, and they continue to choose leisure activi-
ties, significant relationships, and dress and presentation of self that are consistent with 
feminist ideology (Whittier, 1995). Even the consciousness and lives of women who do 
not identify as feminist have been altered by the women's movement. In a study of gender 
and family life in the Silicon Valley of California, Judith Stacey (1987) argues that in the 
1980s some women have incorporated portions of feminism into traditional family and 
work structures by combining a feminist emphasis on developing satisfying careers, shar-
ing household work with husbands, and increasing men's emotional expressiveness through 
fundamentalist Christianity and its focus on the importance of the family. Such women 
critique men's absence from families and lack of emotional expression, reflecting both 
feminism and traditional religion. The effects of the women's movement stretch far be-
yond policies and practices that are explicitly labeled feminist. 
</p>
<p>Another example of women resisting gender practices at the interactional level is </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Movements 163 
</p>
<p>found among African American women involved in little sister fraternity programs on 
college campuses. In their study of such programs, Stombler and Padavic (1997) discov-
ered that African-American women embrace a collective identity built on notions of sis-
terhood and womanly strength to challenge the sexist practices of fraternities. Further, 
these women use the fraternity little sister program to satisfy their own agendas of com-
munity service and self-enhancement. Even within the most traditional male-dominated 
organizations, then, gender relations are not immutable and women are employing di-
verse strategies to resist gender inequality. 
</p>
<p>5.4.2. CHALLENGING THE STRUCTURE OF GENDER INEQUALITY. The challenge to gender 
inequality and the dominant gender order is also waged at the social structural level. As 
we have seen, the liberal bureaucratic strand of the new feminist movement has employed 
legal reform strategies and engaged in street protests to counter sex discrimination in the 
economic, educational, political, and domestic spheres. The legislative campaigns for 
equal pay for work of comparable worth and for maternity policy in the workplace illus-
trate challenges to institutions that essentialize differences between women and men and 
rank "masculine" values and attributes above those identified as feminine (Vogel, 1993). 
The women's movement has created a feminist policy network of elected officials, lobby-
ing organizations, social movement organizations, and individuals who have mobilized 
to address policy issues ranging from abortion rights, domestic violence, and pregnancy 
discrimination to day care (Ferree &amp; Hess, 1994; Gagne, 1998; Staggenborg, 1996). 
</p>
<p>As part of its legislative or legal strategies, the new feminist movement has engaged 
in street protests, such as picketing, mass demonstrations, and civil disobedience. Even 
within the conservative political climate of the 1980s, the feminist movement sparked 
some of the largest feminist demonstrations and actions in years. In April 1989, NOW 
and abortion rights groups organized a national demonstration in Washington, D.C., that 
drew between 300,000 and 600,000 women and men to protest restrictions on abortion. 
Additional national and local demonstrations followed, and pro-choice activists orga-
nized electoral lobbying, defense of abortion clinics, and conferences, and attempted to 
form coalitions across racial and ethnic lines and among women of different ages (Ryan, 
1992; Staggenborg, 1991). The NARAL experienced a growth in membership from 200,000 
in 1989 to 400,000 in 1990 (Staggenborg, 1991, p. 138), and membership in NOW also 
continued to grow in the late 1980s and 1990s after a decline in the early 1980s, with a 
membership of 250,000 in 1989. In addition, a wide variety of feminist organizations 
continue to pursue social change at state and local levels (Ferree &amp; Martin, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Beyond street politics, feminist activism in the 1980s and 1990s moved into diverse 
institutional settings. As an indication of the success and influence of feminist mobiliza-
tion in earlier years, women found niches from which to challenge and transform institu-
tional policies and structures, from pay equity to sexual harassment to occupational sex 
segregation (Blum, 1991). Katzenstein (1997) questions the notion that social move-
ments are antithetical to institutions and that unobstrustive mobilization within institu-
tional boundaries signifies the deradicalization of feminism. In her study of women's 
activism in the military and the Catholic Church, she found that women in the military 
have formed pressure groups, such as Women Military Aviators, that fought for the open-
ing up of combat aviation positions for women. In the Catholic Church, radical religious 
orders have become protected spaces for women who challenge hierarchy within the in-
stitutional church. Although the form and location of feminist protest has changed in the 
1980s and 1990s, this does not necessarily denote a post-feminist era or even the derad-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>164 Cynthia Fabrizio Pelak ET AL. 
</p>
<p>icalization of the women's movement. The transformative potential of feminist activism 
within institutional settings may in some contexts be greater than pressure from outside. 
</p>
<p>5.4.3. RECONSTRUCTING THE CULTURE OF GENDER. At the cultural level, the feminist 
social movement community has challenged cultural values, beliefs, and norms around 
gender and the gender order through building alternative social and cultural institutions 
for women outside mainstream institutions. The strategy of creating autonomous institu-
tions is rooted in radical feminist ideology, which emphasizes that women need to have 
places and events away from patriarchal society where they can develop strength and 
pride as women. Since the early years of the women's movement, an extensive network of 
institutions has emerged within which a feminist culture flourishes (Taylor &amp; Whittier, 
1992). The development of feminist communities contributes to the reconstruction of the 
culture of gender by challenging the devaluation of the feminine and undermining 
androcentric values and beliefs, at the same time that they rearticulate alternative femi-
ninities and woman-centered values and beliefs (Taylor &amp; Rupp, 1993). 
</p>
<p>Into the 1990s, the feminist cultural community has continued to thrive, with groups 
such as the Lesbian Avengers, and with such events as an "annual multicultural multira-
cial conference on aging" for lesbians {Ojf Our Backs, 1991, p. 12), feminist cruises, 
several annual women's music and comedy festivals in different parts of the country. 
Gatherings and conferences in 1990 included groups such as Jewish lesbian daughters of 
holocaust survivors, women motorcyclists, "fat dykes," practitioners of Diannic Wicca, 
Asian lesbians, practitioners of herbal medicine, and survivors of incest. Newsletters and 
publications exist for groups including women recovering from addictions, women's music 
professionals and fans, lesbian separatists, disabled lesbians, lesbian mothers, feminists 
interested in sadomasochism, feminists opposed to pornography, and a multitude of others. 
The growth of the feminist community underscores the flowering of lesbian feminism in 
the late 1980s and 1990s (Esterberg, 1997; Stein, 1997). A wide variety of lesbian and 
lesbian feminist books and anthologies have been published on topics ranging from les-
bian feminist ethics, to separatism, to sexuality, to commitment ceremonies for lesbian 
couples (see, e.g., Butler, 1991; Hoagland, 1988; Hoagland &amp; Penelope, 1988; Loulan, 
1990), reflecting diverse perspectives that have been hotly debated in the pages of lesbian 
publications and at conferences and festivals. For example, a series of letters to the editor 
in a national lesbian newsletter argued over the correct lesbian feminist response to lesbi-
ans serving in the armed forces in the Persian Gulf War: some readers held that the war 
was a manifestation of patriarchy and that lesbians in the military should be criticized; 
others argued that lesbian soldiers should be supported because they are lesbians in a 
homophobic institution, regardless of support or opposition to the war; still others argued 
that the Gulf War was justified and that lesbian servicewomen should be celebrated for 
their patriotic service (Lesbian Connection, 1991). Clearly, the task of building a com-
munity based on the identity "lesbian" has proven complex, if not impossible. Neverthe-
less, the institutional structure of the social movement community has continued to ex-
pand, and within the community feminists construct and reinforce a collective identity 
based on opposition to dominant conceptions of women and lesbians (Taylor &amp; Whittier, 
1992). 
</p>
<p>Another example of resistance on the cultural level is the emergence of women's 
self-help groups in the 1980s and 1990s that sprang directly out of the early women's 
health movement and continue to model feminist consciousness-raising groups (Rap-
ping, 1996; Simonds, 1996). Some feminist writers contend that women's self-help di-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Movements 165 
</p>
<p>verts the feminist agenda away from social and political change and directs women, in-
stead, to change themselves (Kaminer, 1992). Others argue that self-help movements, 
such as the postpartum depression and breast cancer movements, are contributing to the 
reconstruction of gender through the collective redefinition of womanhood and the cul-
tural articulation of alternative femininities (Taylor, 1996; Taylor &amp; Van Willigen, 1996). 
Rather than depoliticized and purely individually focused, self-help movements, Taylor 
(1996) contends, perform a critical role in calling institutions to account for gender in-
equality and refashioning the dominant gender code. 
</p>
<p>All of these diverse strategies, operating at different levels, challenge gender. From 
the individual to the social structural to the cultural plane, we can see the continuous 
impact of the women's movement. 
</p>
<p>5.5. Movement Continuity and Change Into the Twentieth Century 
</p>
<p>Social movement scholars understand that social movements affect one another. The abo-
litionist movement in the mid-nineteenth century influenced the first wave of the women's 
movement in the United States, and the civil rights and New Left movements of the 
1960s shaped the course of the second wave of the women movement (Buechler, 1990). In 
turn, the women's movement has also had a substantial impact on other social move-
ments. Meyer and Whittier (1994) argue that "the ideas, tactics, style, participants, and 
organizations of one movement often spill over its boundaries to affect other social move-
ments" (p. 277, emphasis in the original). The gay and lesbian movement, transgender, 
AIDS, recovery from addictions, New Age, and animal rights movements have been pro-
foundly influenced by feminist values and ideology, including the emphasis on collective 
structure and consensus, the notion of the personal as political, and the critique of patri-
archy extended to the mistreatment of animals and ecological resources (Jasper &amp; Poulsen, 
1995). The women's movement also trained a large number of feminist activists in the 
1970s, particularly lesbians, who have participated in new social movements and inte-
grated feminism into them (Cavin, 1990; Whittier, 1995). The gay and lesbian move-
ment, for example, has expanded its health concerns to include breast cancer as well as 
AIDS and has used strategies of the feminist anti-rape movement to confront violence 
against gays and lesbians. In addition, feminists have renewed coalitions with the peace, 
environmental, socialist, anti-U.S. intervention in Latin America, and anti-apartheid 
movements, transforming these movements both by creating separate feminist organiza-
tions that address these issues and by moving into mixed-sex organizations (Whittier, 
1995). In a sense the women's movement has come full circle, rejoining the 1990s ver-
sions of the movements that composed the New Left in the 1960s when feminists split off 
to form a separate autonomous women's movement. 
</p>
<p>Although the women's movement has changed form and location in the 1980s and 
1990s, the level of mass mobilization and confrontation of the social structural system 
clearly declined following 1982. Because feminism in the late 1980s and 1990s is focused 
more on consciousness and culture and has established roots in other social movements 
of the period, feminist protest is less visible than it was during the heyday of the women's 
movement. Notably, in keeping with the patterns that characterize movements in abey-
ance (Taylor, 1989), the most active feminists in the late 1980s and 1990s have been 
women who became involved with the movement during the late 1960s and 1970s, were </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>166 Cynthia Fabrizio Pelak ET AL. 
</p>
<p>transformed by their involvement, and formed a lasting commitment to feminist goals 
(Whittier, 1995). According to some recent studies (Dill, unpublished; Schneider, 1988), 
despite support for feminist goals, many young women do not identify themselves as 
feminists, apparently because the identity of feminist is stigmatized. A feminist is seen as 
someone who deviates from gender norms by being unattractive, aggressive, hostile to 
men, opposed to marriage and motherhood, lesbian, and imitative of men. Despite the 
gains made by women in some areas, gender norms are still so rigid and deeply internal-
ized that they successfully deter many women, who otherwise support the feminist agenda, 
from participating in the movement. 
</p>
<p>Yet some younger women have joined the women's movement in the late 1980s and 
1990s despite the risks entailed in identifying with a stigmatized and unpopular cause. In 
a study of young feminist activists in the 1990s, Kim Dill (unpublished) has found that a 
new generation of women has been recruited to feminism primarily through Women's 
Studies courses and through the transmission of feminism from mothers to daughters. 
The institutionalized gains of the heyday of feminist activism in the 1970s are enabling 
the women's movement to survive and to disseminate its ideas to new recruits. What 
direction the self-proclaimed "third wave" (Kamen, 1991; Walker, 1992, 1995) will take 
is not at all clear, but the history of the women's movement suggests that a new constitu-
ency will revise feminist ideology, renovate existing structures, respond to a changing 
political climate, and further develop feminist strategies. 
</p>
<p>6. ANTIFEMINIST COUNTERMOVEMENTS 
</p>
<p>The emergence of organized opposition is one indication of the successes of feminist 
movements. In general, it is when social movements pose a serious threat to the status 
quo that countermovements appear (Chafetz &amp; Dworkin, 1987). Antifeminist resistance 
movements mobilized in response to first and second wave feminist movements in the 
United States when feminists began to gain political legitimacy and influence. For ex-
ample, as the first wave of the women's movement was building support for suffrage in 
the late nineteenth century, an organized anti-suffrage movement began to coalesce 
(Marshall, 1997). Likewise, when the feminist movement of the 1970s was gaining po-
litical ground on the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, an anti-ERA move-
ment blossomed (Marshall, 1984). 
</p>
<p>Antifeminist countermovements, like feminist movements, are not monolithic but 
vary over time and place by ideology, strategy, and organization (Blee 1991; Buechler 
1990; Marshall 1985). Chafetz and Dworkin (1987) contend that antifeminist counter-
movements are composed of two constituencies: vested-interest groups which are typi-
cally male-dominated and oppose feminist change movements on the basis of class inter-
ests and voluntary grassroots associations made up of women who are reacting to the 
threat to their status as privileged traditional women. 
</p>
<p>Compared to the scholarship on movements, countermovements have been under-
studied and undertheorized (Meyer &amp; Staggenborg, 1996). Moreover, research on orga-
nized opposition to feminism by women is also limited (Klatch, 1990; Marshall, 1997). 
Women's participation in antifeminist countermovements challenges the radical feminist 
notion that women are a "sex class" with clearly defined gender interests. Differences 
among women, particularly class status, are brought to light when we consider women's 
involvement in antifeminist mobilizations (Luker, 1984). Scholars often characterize </p>
<p/>

<p>Gender Movements 167 
</p>
<p>antifeminist women as victims of false consciousness or as women who are passively 
expressing their husbands' interests. Marshall (1997) argues that these are overly sim-
plistic interpretations and that an appreciation for the ways in which anti-suffragist lead-
ers used their wealth, social networks, and political power to build an oppositional iden-
tity in the anti-suffrage movement suggests "a conceptual shift of the locus of conflict 
over suffrage from culture to politics" (p. 13). In this light, antifeminist women should be 
viewed as political actors who take up gendered class interests independent of their hus-
bands (Marshall, 1997). 
</p>
<p>The interaction between opposing movements is a prominent feature of contempo-
rary American society. Any social movement analysis is incomplete without considering 
the interdependence of movements and countermovements. For example, the tactics, strat-
egies, organizational forms, and feminist identities characteristic of the feminist move-
ment during the 1980s and 1990s cannot be fully understood without considering the 
effects of the anti-abortion mobilization and the rise of the New Right. The relationship 
between movements and countermovements are variously described by social movement 
scholars as loosely coupled conflict (Zald &amp; Useem, 1987); movement conflux created by 
dialectical interaction (Mottle, 1980); and an ebb and flow of opposing movements (Meyer 
&amp; Staggenborg, 1996; Zald &amp; Useem, 1987). 
</p>
<p>The contemporary women's movement in the United States has been opposed by a 
variety of conservative antifeminist groups. In the early 1970s the Stop ERA campaign, 
initiated by Phyllis Schlafly, fought to block the passage of the ERA by state legislatures. 
Through the 1970s, the New Right grew larger and more influential, linking conserva-
tive issues, including opposition to busing, abortion, gay rights, the ERA, and govern-
mental regulation of business through affirmative action and health and safety programs 
(Klatch, 1990). With the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in 1980, the New 
Right gained state support for its agenda. The antifeminist movement in the late 1980s 
and 1990s has spent considerable energy opposing abortion, and its successes in that area 
have been impressive in terms of judicial and legislative gains and disruptive demonstra-
tions at abortion clinics (Simonds, 1996; Staggenborg, 1991). Over the years, a number 
of aggressive splinter groups, such as Operation Rescue, have developed out of the main-
stream National Right to Life Committee, which originated within the Catholic Church. 
The murders of Drs. David Gunn in Pensacola, Florida, and Barnett and Slepian in Buf-
falo, New York, are a potent example of the radical tactics advocated by some antifemi-
nist groups. The prevalence of antifeminist resistance throughout history highlights the 
significance of the family, sexuality, and reproduction for the maintenance of the domi-
nant social order. The growth of antifeminism, however, does not imply that the women's 
movement has failed or run its course. On the contrary, it attests to feminism's successful 
challenge to the status quo. 
</p>
<p>7. MEN'S RESPONSES TO FEMINIST MOBILIZATION 
</p>
<p>Men clearly have been affected by changes in the gender system in the United States. 
Researchers recently have begun to examine men's organized responses to feminism and 
shifts in gender and family relations (Kimmel, 1987; Messner, 1997; Schwalbe, 1996). 
Like women's movements, organized men's responses vary broadly both ideologically 
and structurally. Moreover, along with feminist movements and countermovements, men's 
gender-based movements are becoming major players in the process of reconstituting 
gender and family relations. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>168 Cynthia Fabrizlo Pelak ET AL. 
</p>
<p>Kimmel (1987) contends that, at the turn of the century men's responses to changes 
in the gender system took three forms: masculinist, antifeminist, and pro feminist. The 
masculinist response, cheiracterized by homosocial institutions, was an indirect reaction 
to the purported feminization of American manhood associated with industrialization, 
the separation of work from the home, and the necessity for men to prove themselves in 
the marketplace. The antifeminist and profeminist responses were more direct reactions 
to the women's movement during the period (ICimmel, 1987). Antifeminist responses, 
such as opposition to women's suffrage and women's participation in the public sphere, 
were based on the belief that the traditional patriarchal family is the God-given natural 
social arrangement. Profeminist responses, although variable, generally embraced femi-
nists' demands for an expansion of women's public participation and an end to the gen-
der division of labor in family life and were based on both a sense of justice and the belief 
that gender changes would also benefit men (Kimmel, 1987). 
</p>
<p>Although JCimmel's typology was developed to explain men's responses to the first 
wave of feminism in the United States, there are some parallels to men's oppositional 
movements during the second wave. Messner (1997) maps out some of the major mobili-
zations, which include the men's liberation movement, men's rights groups, the progres-
sive profeminist movement, the Promise Keepers, the Million Man March, the mythopoetic 
movement, and racial and sexual identity movements. 
</p>
<p>Aligned with the liberal branch of the women's movement, the men's liberation 
movement emerged in the mid-1970s (Messner, 1997). Men's liberation took up the dis-
course of sex roles and organized around the belief that the dominant sex/gender system 
oppressed both women and men. In particular, men's liberationists stressed the costs of 
masculinity for men. By the late 1970s, the men's liberation movement had transformed 
itself into two divergent branches. The antifeminist men's rights branch, which includes 
organizations such as Men's Rights, Inc. formed in 1977 and The Coalition of Free Men 
formed in 1980, espouses the view that men are the real victims of rigid sex roles, prosti-
tution, pornography, divorce settlements, false rape and sexual harassment accusations, 
and even domestic violence. Men's rights groups also claim that the feminist movement 
is an attempt to cover up the fact that women, as a group, possess the "real" power (Messner, 
1997). 
</p>
<p>On the other end of the political spectrum, the collective identity of the progressive 
profeminist men's branch embraces the discourse and politics of gender hierarchy in 
which women are viewed as institutionally oppressed and men are believed to enjoy struc-
turally based power and privilege over women. There are two major ideological and po-
litical positions within the profeminist men's wing. Radical profeminist men's groups 
focus on male sexuality and sexual violence as a major cause of women's oppression, 
whereas socialist profeminist men rely on Marxist feminism to incorporate the interac-
tion of class relations and gender relations in their analyses of women's oppression. Re-
gardless of their differences, profeminist men's organizations, such as the National Orga-
nization for Men Against Sexism (NOMAS), position themselves in opposition to the 
men's rights movement (Messner, 1997). Although men active in the profeminist men's 
movement are dedicated to improving women's status relative to men's, the size of 
profeminist men's mobilizations has decreased sharply from the 1970s to the present. 
</p>
<p>The political conservatism and antifeminism of the 1980s gave rise to new forms of 
mass mobilization by men, including the mythopoetic movement. Schwalbe (1996) de-
scribes the mythopoetic movement as a spiritual, anti-intellectual movement in which 
men together construct positive male identities by rediscovering and reclaiming their </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Movements 169 
</p>
<p>inherent masculinity. Robert Bly, whose national best-seller Iron John helped popularize 
the mythopoetic movement in the United States, asserts that men in postindustrial society 
lack masculinity rituals to connect to their deep masculine natures, which are neither 
feminine nor hypermasculine (Bly, 1990). Mythopoetic weekend retreats into the woods, 
attended by thousands of men in the 1990s, serve as such masculinizing rituals. Schwalbe 
</p>
<p>(1996) argues that the mythopoetic men's movement's gender politics and strategic anti-
intellectualism allow participants to deny the structural basis of gender, which creates 
fundamental differences in the foundations of women's and men's problems. Other schol-
ars contend that the mythopoetic movement is essentialist, unjustly dismisses feminism, 
and overlooks differences of race, class, and sexuality among men (Kimmel, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Another all-male movement grounded in overt gender politics is the Promise Keep-
ers, an evangelical Christian men's movement that emerged in the 1990s. Mobilizing 
through traditionally masculine organizational forms, the highly centralized Promise 
Keepers has orchestrated numerous mass rallies that have drawn over IVi million men to 
61 weekend conferences in football stadiums around the country. Messner (1997) con-
tends that similar to the muscular Christianity movement at the turn of the century, which 
gave rise to organizations such as the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), the 
Promise Keepers, who are mostly white, middle-class, and heterosexual, represent a 
reassertion of essentiahst views of women's and men's roles in the family and a reaction 
to the perceived national crisis of the feminization of the American male. However, Messner 
</p>
<p>(1997) also recognizes that there are multiple contradictions embodied in the Promise 
Keepers movement. He maintains that the Promise Keepers can be understood, simulta-
neously, as Christian masculinity therapy in a confusing and anxiety-producing era, as an 
organized and highly politicized antifeminist, anti-gay backlash, and as a bargain struck 
with women to become responsible breadwinners, fathers, and husbands within the tradi-
tional family structure (Messner, 1997, p . 35). 
</p>
<p>The 1995 Million Man March, which attracted an estimated 800,000, mostly Afri-
can-American men, to Washington, D.C. is another contemporary example of men's 
mobilization. Messner (1997) asserts that, like the Promise Keepers, the Million Man 
March contains contradictions and tensions that demonstrate, on the one hand, a positive 
and meaningful mobilization of men of African heritage to stand up for justice, and, on 
the other hand, a reassertion of a conservative essentialist view of the gender order. In all 
men's organized responses to shifting gender relations&mdash;and more broadly to larger so-
cial and economic changes&mdash;there are dimensions of the organizations, ideologies, iden-
tities, and strategies of the mobilizations that simultaneously challenge and reaffirm the 
dominant gender order. 
</p>
<p>8. CONCLUSION 
</p>
<p>There is a growing realization among scholars that theories of gender have tended to 
</p>
<p>emphasize the maintenance and reproduction of gender inequality and to neglect, as 
</p>
<p>Thome puts it, "the countervailing processes of resistance, challenge, conflict, and change" 
</p>
<p>(1995, p. 498). Over the past two centuries there have been significant changes in the 
</p>
<p>lives of American women and men brought on, in part, by large-scale social and eco-
</p>
<p>nomic transformations. Although we recognize the significance of broad structural pro-
</p>
<p>cesses in creating gender change, we also believe that it is important to understand the 
</p>
<p>role of human agents who promote changes in gender relations in response to the oppor-</p>

</p>
<p>tunities created by structural conditions (see Staggenborg, 1998 for a similar argument). 
Gender movements, including feminist movements, countermovements, men's movements, 
and even other social movements not specifically focused on gender, have played an 
important role in increasing women's participation in the workplace, politics, and educa-
tion, as well as in pushing for men's greater participation in family life. Indeed, if one 
looks at the significance of gender to the collective identities of the social movements of 
the late 1990s&mdash;including the gay and lesbian movement, women's self-help, and the 
variety of men's movements&mdash;it is difficult to deny the centrality of gender for contempo-
rary collective action. We cannot, however, fully understand the way gender figures into 
the dynamics of social movements, nor can we assess the contributions social movement 
actors make to shifts in gender relations, without a set of concepts that allows us to 
examine the interplay between gender and movements. 
</p>
<p>In tracing the role of social movements in the transformation of gender, we have 
sketched a framework that is useful for assessing the gender outcomes of collective action 
at multiple levels. Gender is constructed and reconstructed on various planes and our 
examination of social movements should be attentive to this multistory process. Multi-
level theories of gender suggest that to understand the impact that a given social move-
ment has on the gender order, we must look for evidence of changes in gender at the 
interactional, the structural, and the cultural levels (Connell, 1987; West &amp; Zimmerman, 
1987). This approach allows us to recognize that gender can change in a myriad of ways 
that do not necessarily subvert the institutional basis of gender. These theories also allow 
us to analyze the role of gender in social movement processes, specifically the way the 
clash of interests constituted within gender relations exerts influence on the opportunity 
structures, collective identities and ideologies, structures, and strategies that are the in-
gredients of collective challenges. Viewing social movements as engaged in the social 
construction of gender helps explain the contradictory elements displayed in many gen-
der movements. For example, modern women's self-help movements challenge the hier-
archy and practices of male-dominated medicine, but at the same time adopt mobilizing 
structures and strategies that assume that women's modes of relating are fundamentally 
different than men's, thereby reinforcing traditional notions of gender difference. It also 
allows us to recognize how support for changing gender relations, ironically, can come 
from antifeminist women's and men's movements. 
</p>
<p>Finally, we must also recognize that gender interacts with other systems of stratifica-
tion, such as class, race, ethnicity, and sexuality, that mediate the collective identities, 
strategies, and structures of gender movements. Women's movements, as we have seen, 
have taken multiple forms throughout history, and women who have organized under the 
banner of feminism have often disagreed about the nature of gender discrimination and 
the best ways to meet women's needs and interests. Both outside and within dominant 
social institutions, feminists have challenged male dominance and connected gender in-
equality to a myriad of problems in their lives. Although there is a multiplicity of feminist 
mobilizations around the world, and even in the United States, there are also unifying 
ideas and common themes that have persisted within women's movements. By and large, 
most feminist movements are focused on challenging structurally based gender stratifica-
tion and gender oppression at various levels and spheres of interaction. Feminist identity, 
then, is one way that women express their common interests. Connecting feminist iden-
tity to movement organizations and the larger political and historical context offers in-
sight into the changing meaning of feminism. We believe that fuller integration of the 
theoretical literatures on gender and social movements will advance our understanding of </p>

</p>
<p>Gender and Organizations 
</p>
<p>JOAN ACKER 
</p>
<p>As the new women's movement took shape in the 1960s, feminists criticized organiza-
tional hierarchies and bureaucratic practices as masculine, undemocratic, and oppres-
sive, and also argued that men monopolized leading positions, even in radical organiza-
tions, excluding women from positions of power and influence. Consequently, critiques 
of organized male power and the organizational forms in which it was expressed were 
integral to feminism, and feminists attempted early on to organize in nonhierarchical, 
nonbureaucratic ways (Ferree &amp; Martin, 1995; Freeman, 1972-1973). Despite this early 
concern about organizations and male power, gender and organizations as a field of schol-
arly study developed considerably later than other "gender specializations." In this chap-
ter, I review the history of the field and examine its contents, focussing on organizational 
structures of gender inequality, organizations as gendered processes, masculinity and 
sexuality in organizations, gender and organizational change, and potential contribu-
tions of this approach to understanding contemporary societal problems. 
</p>
<p>1. A HISTORY OF THE FIELD OF GENDER AND ORGANIZATIONS 
</p>
<p>Scholarly interest in women and/or sex roles and organizations began slowly in the early 
</p>
<p>1970s with criticisms of organizational theory and research for its inattention to the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of women in work organizations and the resulting misinterpretations of research 
</p>
<p>results (Acker &amp; Van Houten, 1974). Rosabeth Moss Kanter (1975) pointed to the male 
</p>
<p>dominance of almost all complex organizations and argued that the classical rational 
</p>
<p>model of organization saw organizations as sex-neutral machines while, at the same time, 
</p>
<p>supporting a "masculine ethic" of rationality and reason that obscured organizational

<p>reality and supported managerial authority. Kanter's (1977) Men and Women of the Cor-
poration was a case study of (male) management and (female) clerical workers that still 
stands, in spite of many changes in the ensuing 20 years, as a definitive statement, valid 
for many different countries, about the sex structuring of organizations and the conse-
quences for women. Kanter's central thesis was that women's organizational experiences 
are best explained by women's structural locations, not by their personalities and social-
ization. Women are, in the vast majority, confined to low-level jobs at the bottom of 
organizational hierarchies, where they are frustrated and alienated by lack of opportuni-
ties. The few women who reach upper organizational levels are tokens who are stereo-
typed and exposed to criticisms not inflicted on men, who are seen as the "natural" occu-
pants of higher positions. 
</p>
<p>In the period following Kanter's book, feminists conducted a substantial amount of 
research on women in management (Powell, 1988; Terborg, 1977), but engaged in little 
theorizing (Martin, 1981). The primary exception was Kathy Ferguson's (1984) The Femi-
nist Case Against Bureaucracy, a radical feminist critique of bureaucracy as a construc-
tion of male domination, mystified through a discourse on rationality and rules. Although 
this was a brilliant and scathing critique, for Ferguson all organizational participants are 
rendered powerless by bureaucracy; thus the specificity of gender and the dominance of 
certain men disappears (Acker, 1990). By the early 1980s, a flood of research on women 
and work began to appear, vastly increasing knowledge in this area. Some of this research 
began to illuminate the importance of the organizational context for understanding the 
connections between gender and work. Cynthia Cockburn (1981, 1985) described how, in 
struggles over technology, skill, and power in the workplace, both class and gender rela-
tions are created (see also Hacker, 1981). Arlie Hochschild (1983) showed how the man-
agement of emotions is often an aspect of work, particularly in women's jobs in certain 
service organizations. Ann Game and Rosemary Pringle (1983) also showed how chang-
ing technologies, along with changing organization of production and services, were 
accomplished partly through changing gender relations. 
</p>
<p>Such research and conceptualization contributed to the emergence of a new under-
standing of gender as a fundamental aspect of social processes and structures, going far 
beyond the earlier ideas of gender as social role, personality component, or individual 
attribute (Acker, 1992a). This understanding of gender was fundamental to arguments 
that organizations are "gendered" social constructions and that theories of gender neutral 
organizations are ideological formulations that obscure organizational realities, includ-
ing the pervasiveness of male power. These ideas stimulated a rapid development of work 
on gender and organizations in the second half of the 1980s and into the 1990s. Gender 
and organizations as a distinct area of study can be dated from that time. Marking the 
emergence of this new area in sociology was a session titled "A Feminist Critique of 
Bureaucracy," organized by Patricia Martin at the 1987 American Sociological Associa-
tion meetings. Research and theory building has progressed primarily in the English-
speaking countries, although Scandinavian (BilHng, 1994; Billing &amp; Alvesson, 1994; 
Czarniawska-Joerges, 1994; Kvande &amp; Rassmussen, 1974) and Italian (Gherardi, 1995) 
scholars have also participated. Two anthologies, Gendering Organizational Analysis 
(1992), edited by Albert Mills and Peta Tancred, and Gender and Bureaucracy (1992), 
edited by Mike Savage and Sue Witz, brought together examples of this work. A journal, 
Gender, Work, and Organization, was founded in 1994, and the most recent Handbook of 
Organization Studies (Clegg, Hardy, &amp; Nord, 1996) has an entry on "Feminist Approaches </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Organizations 179 
</p>
<p>to Organization Studies" (CaWs &amp; Smircich, 1996). This is an interdisciplinary field that 
includes, in addition to sociologists, organizational theorists in schools of management 
and business, psychologists, political scientists, anthropologists, scholars in education, 
and economists. Scholars use a variety of theoretical approaches, ranging from quantita-
tive analyses of sex roles to postmodern interpretations, but all with critical views of 
existing gender-neutral organizational analyses. In the 1990s, recognition that sexuality 
is implicated in the shaping of gendered work demands (Adkins, 1995) and gendered 
hierarchies (Witz, Halford, &amp; Savage, 1996), together with the understanding that orga-
nizations are embodied processes (Acker, 1990, 1992b), have deepened the challenges to 
notions of organizations as abstract, gender-neutral structures. 
</p>
<p>2. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES OF GENDER INEQUALITY 
</p>
<p>Scholars began to study gender and organizations to understand better the dimensions of 
and reasons for continuing inequality between women and men in the workplace and the 
economy. Most research on gender structures has been done in public and private em-
ploying organizations, but researchers have also examined voluntary organizations such 
as religious groups, charity organizations, and sports associations. Although gender pat-
terns in organizations vary between the public and private sectors and between different 
sectors of the private economy, as well as between different societies, enough similarity 
exists to be able to make general statements about these patterns for organizations in the 
rich Northern nations. Work organizations are obviously stratified by sex both vertically 
and horizontally. Managerial positions, especially those at or near the top, are still dis-
proportionately filled by white men (Rubin, 1997). Career mobility for women and mi-
nority men is limited by a "glass ceiling"and a "sticky floor." Jobs and occupations are 
sex typed and often sex segregated within employing organizations as well as in the labor 
market as a whole (Bielby &amp; Baron, 1984; Burchell, 1996). Women still fill the vast 
majority of clerical positions; men still dominate engineering and skilled blue collar oc-
cupations. As occupational tasks and demands change, the sex typing and composition of 
an occupation may change (Reskin &amp; Roos, 1990), but sex typing and sex segregation 
often persist (Buswell &amp; Jenkins, 1994). The wage gap between women and men is re-
lated to the sex segregation of occupations: the relative wage disadvantage for both women 
and men in an occupation increases as the proportion of women in the occupation in-
creases (England, 1992). Studies of comparable worth efforts have shown how gender 
wage differences are built into organizational structures (e.g.. Acker, 1989; Blum, 1991). 
Although sex typing of occupations, horizontal sex segregation, and gender differenti-
ated wage setting have most often been studied as aggregate phenomena at regional or 
national levels, organizations are the actual locations within which these patterns are 
created and re-created. Consequently, to understand the reproduction of these sorts of 
inequalities, it is necessary to look at organizations and their internal processes. 
</p>
<p>Although the original impetus for the study of gender and organizations was to 
improve our understanding of sex inequality and women's subordination, a gender per-
spective may also increase our abilities to answer other questions about organizations, 
including questions about organizational culture, about varieties of power and control, 
and about emerging changes in the global organization of economic and political power 
characteristic of the contemporary world. </p>

<p>3. ORGANIZATIONS AS GENDERED PROCESSES 
</p>
<p>One of the answers to questions about how women's subordination or secondary status in 
working life is perpetuated is that gender is embedded in ordinary organizational pro-
cesses and that inequalities are reproduced as the mundane work of the "gendered" orga-
nization is carried out. Understanding organizations as gendered entails a shift in per-
spective from the conventional view of organizations as rational bounded systems to 
organizing as processes and practices, a perspective with a long history that informs 
other critical approaches to organizations (Czarniawska-Joerges, 1996). The ongoing flow 
of activities and interactions that constitute the living processes of organizing can be 
accessed from different points of entry (Acker 1990, 1992b) to discover if and how gender 
is part of these processes. These "points of entry" are ways of analytically managing 
complex processes and do not represent "analytic levels." 
</p>
<p>3.1. Procedures, activities, divisions 
</p>
<p>The first point of entry or set of processes consists of things people do to keep organiza-
tions going, including hiring; promotion; performance evaluation, allocation of work, 
setting salaries and wages; the actual work process; inventing and enforcing rules about 
hours, breaks, workplace behavior, and time off; designing and introducing new technol-
ogy; and reorganizing or relocating work. As these ordinary activities are carried out, 
they result in organizational gender divisions, such as a gendered hierarchy, gender seg-
regation of jobs and positions, a gendered wage gap, and practices that separate the work-
place from the rest of life along gender lines. Class, race, and ethnic divisions may be 
created in the same processes. These activities often involve routine decisions made by 
employees as well as managers, who may be completely unaware that they are helping to 
create gender divisions. An example comes from a study I (Acker, 1989) did of state 
employment in Oregon: the state routinely classified 7000 women workers into four job 
classes, although these 7000 jobs varied greatly in task complexity and degree of respon-
sibility. The jobs were described, again routinely, at the lowest common denominator as 
demanding little skill and knowledge and deserving to be in the lower pay grades. Job 
classifications for male-predominant jobs were much more detailed and differentiated; 
these jobs were assigned to a broader range of pay scales. Thus, the routine classification 
process contributed to low wages for the majority of women, while men were spread more 
evenly across the wage structure. No one doing the work of classification intended to 
maintain the gender wage gap. Such routine decisions may, however, be consciously made 
along lines of gender. For example, some Swedish banks in the 1980s established a 
"housewive's shift", expressly to recruit women for late afternoon hours when husbands 
would be at home to care for the children. This policy was a conscious creation of a 
gender-segregated labor force (Acker, 1994a). A great deal of research has made visible 
the ways in which organizational practices and routine decisions reproduce gender divi-
sions, and these practices have often been the target of efforts to increase gender equality, 
such as comparable worth plans and Affirmative Action programs. 
</p>
<p>Managers in specific organizations may alter their procedures in response to outside 
pressures, such as Affirmative Action requirements, laws on parental leave, or&mdash;to a 
minimal degree in the United States&mdash;labor union demands. Barbara Reskin and Patricia 
Roos (1990) document the complex processes, including Affirmative Action, that have </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Organizations 181 
</p>
<p>caused the changed sex composition of certain occupations. Although their analysis is 
occupationally based, it is revealing about organizational processes and pressures in main-
taining and changing gender divisions. Thus, evidence for specific organizations and 
occupations suggests that sometimes conscious equality efforts do result in positive changes 
for some women. At the same time, such efforts often fail because men in the organiza-
tion oppose them (Cockburn, 1991). In addition, the formulation of equal opportunity 
policies and procedures may allow men to claim, against the evidence, that inequalities 
no longer exist (Buswell &amp; Jenkins, 1994; Calvert &amp; Ramsey, 1996) and that it is up to 
women to compete in terms of skill and commitment of time to the organization (Buswell 
&amp; Jenkins, 1994). Thus, the issue of structural inequality becomes an an issue of indi-
vidual effort. 
</p>
<p>Managers often use textual tools, such as screening tests, evaluation criteria, job 
design and evaluation protocols, job classification schemes, or various wage-setting pro-
cedures in making routine decisions. The use of such tools tends to objectify the pro-
cesses, making them appear inevitable and disembodied. Job evaluation, as used in the 
Oregon study (Acker, 1989), is a very good example of the ways in which such tools can 
embed assumptions about gender (see also Steinberg, 1992). In this job evaluation scheme, 
the caring skills required in many female-typed jobs, such as nurse or daycare worker, 
were given few evaluated "points," while the material-technical skills required in many 
male-typed jobs, such as engineer or electrician, received more "points." Another feature 
of this scheme was that the demands of managerial jobs were assessed several times, 
resulting in "overcounting" of the value of these jobs. Because most managerial jobs, 
especially those at high levels in the hierarchy, were filled by men, this "doublecounting" 
added to gender wage differences. Job evaluation documents and rules are elements of 
what Dorothy Smith (1987) has called the abstract, intellectual, textually mediated rela-
tions of ruling. These texts and instructions in their proper use, often developed and sold 
by management consultants, encode social relations that are then reproduced as the same 
in many different sites. 
</p>
<p>Struggles for power and control are often struggles over bureaucratic tools. For ex-
ample, in the state of Oregon, management and trade unions had their major conflicts 
over the classification system and the definition and use of the salary scales (Acker, 1989). 
Ordinary Oregon employees were quite sophisticated about these systems and often pur-
sued individual wage increases through reclassification into higher wage grades for their 
own jobs, much to the distress of their managers. Knowledge of bureaucratic details is a 
resource in these struggles. Where there are trade unions, it has historically been union 
men who have that knowledge because, as in Sweden for example, men are the wage 
negotiators and union activists. Feminists have found in many cases (e.g.. Acker, 1991) 
that challenging the male monopoly over knowledge and control of negotiations is neces-
sary to promote the interests of women employees. Such challenges have been difficult 
for women to win partly because wage negotiations are an arena that men protect as their 
own. Women also have difficulty challenging male control because they have been pre-
vented from gaining sufficient union experience by union organizational practices built 
around the time patterns of men. Meetings that occur after work when many women need 
to be at home cooking and caring for children, expectations that union activists will be 
available to go to weekend workshops far from home, and negotiation sessions that last 
long into the night are all problematic practices for women with families. Such practices 
keep women from gaining experience dealing with the bureaucratic systems of the orga-
nization, and thus often exclude them from leadership in union work. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>182 Joan Acker 
</p>
<p>Routine requirements of workplaces may, on the other hand, structure gender rela-
tions outside the work organization, at home and in the wider community. Work sched-
ules, rules about time off and telephone use, and expectations that employees put the job 
first before the rest of life all can affect women in different ways than men (e.g., Bailyn, 
1993; Hochschild, 1989, 1997). Such expectations may be impossible to meet for women, 
and occasionally men, with family obligations. A result has been that many women either 
move out of the job market or work part-time. Either solution involves the re-creation of 
patterns of male dominance within families and in the workplace. Women with the sole 
responsibility for children may be doubly disadvantaged in trying to adapt rigid work-
place patterns to unpredictable family demands. Employing organizations vary widely in 
the degree to which their policies accommodate extraorganizational obligations of em-
ployees. When family friendly policies do exist, they can remain unimplemented when 
the company culture expects and rewards long working hours and few vacation days 
(Hochschild, 1997). Even in countries in which the state requires certain organizational 
accommodations to family life, the Scandinavian countries, for example, the person who 
uses the programs (usually a woman) is likely to have fewer career opportunities than the 
person who does not (usually a man) (Acker, 1994c). 
</p>
<p>In sum, wide variations exist in the clarity and pervasiveness of gender divisions 
and in the procedures and practices that create and change them. But the complete ab-
sence of divisions is rare. I find it striking how often similar patterns are repeated in 
widely separated locations, and how universally the power of men and the masculine is 
confirmed, in spite of the obvious improvement of the work situations of many women in 
industrial countries during the last 25 years. 
</p>
<p>3.2. Images, Symbols, Forms of Consciousness 
</p>
<p>People in organizations create images, symbols, and forms of consciousness that justify, 
legitimate, and even glamorize the persistent gender divisions. This is a second point of 
entry for examining gendered processes. Images and understandings are integral to the 
practices, described previously, that create an organization and its divisions. Images, 
symbols, and forms of consciousness function ideologically to help to naturalize relations 
of power. For example, organizational consultants I observed in my study of comparable 
worth (Acker, 1989) often appealed to "common sense" and "what everyone knows" to 
create a sense that hierarchy is natural. Beliefs that certain knowledge and skills are 
innate to women, while real skill, that which men have, comes through long training; 
that typical women's skills require only a basic education; that skilled, technology-based 
work is masculine and unskilled, routine and caring work is feminine, all naturalize male 
advantage. (See, e.g.. Acker, 1989; Cockburn, 1983,1985; Game &amp; Pringle, 1983; Phillips 
&amp; Taylor, 1980). Such beliefs influence hiring, promotion, and wage- setting, as do be-
liefs that women are suited only to particular kinds of jobs because of their competing 
home responsibilities (Jones &amp; Causer, 1995). 
</p>
<p>The image of the organization as a gender-neutral, abstract hierarchy of jobs and 
positions, articulated in organization theory and in management thinking, plays an ideo-
logical role in both obscuring gender and in embedding an image of a male worker or 
manager in assumptions about how organizations should be put together (Acker, 1990, 
1992b). Beginning with Weber's analysis of bureaucracy, a job or position has been seen 
as a space defined by tasks, responsibilities, and authority, but devoid of any human body </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Organizations 183 
</p>
<p>and any ties or obligations to anything or anyone outside the organization. This image 
still exists in social theory and in employers' assumptions that managers and workers 
will place work obligations before other demands, and will spend employer-defined peri-
ods of time at work during which they will keep their attention focused on work. Taking 
care of physical needs, for example, eating, or social needs, for example, those created by 
a child's illness, are viewed as taking time from work. The "perfect worker" implied by 
the concept of the empty slot would not have to do any of these things. Men who have the 
support services of wives or secretaries can approximate this model. Women, almost by 
definition, cannot. It can be argued, then, that the gender-neutral model of the organiza-
tion assumes a male worker and manager as well as a gendered division of labor in which 
women do the tasks of life maintenance and renewal, usually in a private sector removed 
from the organization. This image of the organization as an abstract, gender-neutral 
entity with its legitimate demands that supersede other demands undergirds organiza-
tional rules and practices that then help to confirm and perpetuate the image. In the 
process, women's disadvantages are also confirmed. 
</p>
<p>Intentional symbolic production of gender is the business of many complex organi-
zations, particularly media organizations. But explicit gender images, in addition to the 
implicit images I discussed previously, are created within and infuse organizational struc-
tures of all kinds, including religious, military, political, and social movement organiza-
tions. These images usually contain implications of masculinity and male sexuality 
(Collinson &amp; Hearn, 1994). Metaphors of a stereotypical hegemonic masculinity (Connell, 
1987) are often ways of defining the competent, successful organization (Kanter, 1975, 
1977). The lean, mean, efficient, aggressive, competitive organization is the one that will 
survive and prosper in today's mean and competitive economy. Feminine images, such as 
empathy and caring, are rarely called upon to describe a well-functioning organization, 
except for certain service organizations such as hospitals, food banks, and daycare cen-
ters. The content of images and metaphors changes historically, but not their gendered 
nature. Thus, the resurgence of the corporation as the good father and the manager as the 
kindly overseer is a possiblity as large business organizations contend with distrust and 
suspicion by their workers and the general public. On the other hand, in the course of my 
study of Swedish banks (Acker 1991, 1994a), I observed a change in the opposite direc-
tion. Bank employees had seen their top management and the banks themselves as be-
nevolent, paternal, steady, and responsible. In light of a scandal involving the CEO of the 
largest bank; the promotion of competitive values over community and customer service; 
and the influx of young, aggressive, entrepeneurial male managers, the employees we 
interviewed were disillusioned, relinquishing their old images, but filled with apprehen-
sion about the image of the manager. 
</p>
<p>3.3. Interactions Between Individuals and Groups 
</p>
<p>The work of organizing goes on through interactions between people, women and men, 
</p>
<p>women and women, men and men, supervisors and subordinates, co-workers, and be-
</p>
<p>tween employees and customers, clients, consultants, or others from the outside. While 
</p>
<p>doing the work of organizing, people are also "doing gender" (West &amp; Fenstermaker, 
</p>
<p>1995). These interactions are the everyday contexts within which people experience and 
</p>
<p>create dominance and submission, create alliances and exclusions, put together and imple-
</p>
<p>ment policies that divide and differentiate between women and men, and produce and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>184 Joan Acker 
</p>
<p>confirm gender images. Contexts and forms of interaction vary and they may be formally 
structured or informally, even subversively created. Gender is integral to many organiz-
ing practices and activities, rather than an external element that can be easily excised. 
</p>
<p>Gender is deeply embedded, for example, in the interactions between bosses and 
secretaries, or clerical workers and managers. The boss-secretary relationship, as well as 
the divisions of status and tasks between them, is rooted in a gender division in which the 
boss was a man and the secretary was a woman. Personal service from the secretary and 
paternal protection from the boss marked this relationship. It was no accident that secre-
taries were often called "office wives," as Rosabeth Moss Kanter (1977) pointed out. 
Although today there are many women managers, at least at the lower and middle levels, 
few men are secretaries or clerical workers. When men are in such positions, they are 
usually called something else, such as a research assistant (Pringle, 1989), and they are 
not expected to perform the supportive personal services expected from women (Pierce, 
1995). Receptionists, airline stewardesses, nurses, and other service workers are also in 
subordinate female-typed jobs in which they are expected to interact with superiors and 
customers in appropriately feminine and respectful ways. Sexuality, both overt and hid-
den, may be a component of these interactions, supporting the dominance of certain men, 
solidifying relations between men, and establishing the subordination of women (Adkins, 
1995; Pringle, 1989). 
</p>
<p>Situations undoubtedly exist in which gender is not present in interactions. How-
ever, the research on gender and organizations is full of descriptions of ways in which 
gender is produced even in ordinary encounters between equals in the workplace (Pierce, 
1995). For example, Kanter (1977) documented the interactions between male managers 
and the few, or token, women who had achieved managerial status at that time. These 
interactions, shaped by the men in stereotypical terms, reaffirmed the stereotypes by de-
fining the women managers as "mothers," "seductresses," "pets," or "iron maidens," 
confirming their conditional status as outsiders. In a more recent analysis of gendered 
interactions, Patricia Martin (1996) suggests that men enact masculinities in certain situ-
ations, conflating such enactments with their work activities and, in the process, relegat-
ing women to the situation of outsider. Martin identifies several gendered interactional 
styles in which men "enact masculinity" in evaluating job candidates and others' work in 
a university setting. Men, in her study, promoted the needs, talents, and accomplishments 
of themselves and other men over the talents and accomplishments of women. They asked 
for help from other men in pursuing their careers, while women did not seem to expect 
such aid. They made open criticisms of women, but not of men, and they collectively 
"ganged up" on women to denigrate their capacities. As Martin observes, "In exploring 
interactional dynamics, we gain insights into how men 'erect' barriers . . . " (1996, p 
206). 
</p>
<p>3,4. Internal Mental Work 
</p>
<p>The fourth point of entry to understanding gendered organizing processes is through the 
</p>
<p>internal mental work of individuals as they come to understand the organization's gendered 
</p>
<p>expectations and opportunities, including the appropriate gendered behaviors and atti-
</p>
<p>tudes (Cockburn, 1991; Hochschild, 1983; Pierce, 1995; Pringle, 1989). Here, too, race 
</p>
<p>and class are implicated and constructed. In White Collar, C. Wright Mills (1956) was 
</p>
<p>one of the first to point to "personality markets," and the ways in which employees were </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Organizations 185 
</p>
<p>expected to construct themselves as charming and sincere. Although Mills did not recog-
nize gender as part of this process, one can easily read masculinity and femininity into 
his analysis. Gendered expectations may be ambiguous and contradictory, thus requiring 
considerable interior mental work to get it right. All workers must first recognize what is 
appropriate and then try to control and shape their actions and feelings in those direc-
tions. Swedish bank workers, for example, are supposed to be friendly and calm; calm-
ness, in particular we were told, may require extreme efforts at controlling one's outer 
behavior in the face of long lines of waiting customers, ringing telephones, and new 
technology that has not been sufficiently explained. Women bank employees believed 
that women were much better able to handle such emotional/mental work than were men. 
Inappropriate behavior, for example, by a woman refusing to be a good sport about men's 
sexual joking, can result in ostracism and dangerous isolation (Enarson, 1984). Women 
then have to cope emotionally with such humiliations and transform such feelings by 
convincing themselves that all this was just a joke. Women who are subjected to sexual 
harassment often go through painful decisions about whether to complain because com-
plaint can violate the tacit understanding of appropriate female behavior, leading to job 
loss. The decision about whether to tolerate or complain can mean painful inner pro-
cesses involving dealing with fear and identity. 
</p>
<p>Jennifer L. Pierce's (1995) study of two law firms, Gender Trials, exemplifies the 
various processes outlined previously. She describes the history and present structure of 
law firms as gendered bureaucracies. On the basis of her ethnographic work, she analyzes 
the emotional labor construed as masculine that marks the job of the litigator and the 
practice of law, and contrasts the "rambo litigator" with the paralegal whose job requires 
deference and caregiving as emotional labor. The caregiving and deference, both femi-
nized practices, confirm the status of the lawyers and help to reproduce the gendered 
hierarchy of the law firms. Some female paralegals are uncomfortable with the gendered 
persona required by their work, but even their resistance tends to reinforce the gender 
structure. Women litigators, few in number, face a double bind: if they behave as aggres-
sively as the men, they are considered too aggressive; if they do not, they are not tough 
enough. Men who are paralegals, on the other hand, are not held to the same supportive 
behaviors as the women, functioning more as junior colleagues to the attorneys. Thus, the 
ordinary work of these firms assumes gendered hierarchies. These hierarchies and the 
ongoing work depend upon and reproduce highly gendered images of the organizations 
and their central members. Gender is daily reproduced in the interactions that constitute 
the work, and individuals must learn and cope with the gender identities appropriate to 
the work. 
</p>
<p>4. MASCULINITY AND ORGANIZATION 
</p>
<p>Masculinity and organization has become a major focus in the study of gender and orga-
</p>
<p>nizing (e.g., Collinson &amp; Hearn, 1994, 1996). As I have indicated previously, masculin-
</p>
<p>ity enters in various ways in the playing out of organizing practices and policies that 
</p>
<p>constitute the mundane, everyday processes of organizations and in the images, identi-
</p>
<p>ties, and interactions involved. Here I want to extend that discussion to look in more 
</p>
<p>detail at some issues about masculinity and organization. 
</p>
<p>Masculinity is defined by Deborah Kerfoot and David Knights (1996) as " . . . the 
</p>
<p>socially generated consensus of what it means to be a man, to be 'manly' or to display </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>186 Joan Acker 
</p>
<p>such behaviour at any one time" (p. 86). Thus, masculinity is clearly distinguished from 
actual men, who may differ in their practice of masculinity from this consensus. How-
ever, David Collinson and Jeff Hearn (1994) argue that masculinity is vaguely defined. 
"Does it refer to behaviours, identities, relationships, experiences, appearances, discourses 
or practices? . . . Are masculinities irreducibly related to men or are they discourses in 
which women can also invest" (p. 9)? Those writing on the topic do seem to agree that 
multiple masculinities exist in any society at any particular time, and that masculinities 
shift historically, as do femininities. Connell (1987, 1995) developed the concept "hege-
monic masculinity" to stand for the dominant form that characterizes masculinity in 
positions of societal power. Hegemonic masculinity "embodies the currently accepted 
answer to the problem of the legitimacy of patriarchy, which guarantees (or is taken to 
guarantee) the dominant position of men and the subordination of women." (Connell, 
1995, p. 77.) "Subordinated masculinities" are then defined in contrast to and dominated 
by hegemonic masculinity. 
</p>
<p>Hegemonic masculinity is the form most often linked to the management of large 
organizations, a form that changes over time as the organization of production changes, 
although at any particular moment several different masculinities may exist. Beverly 
Burris (1996) identifies different forms of organizational and managerial patriarchy that 
represent different hegemonic masculinities, including entrepreneurial patriarchy, tech-
nical patriarchy, bureaucratic patriarchy, professional patriarchy, and technocratic patri-
archy (the form found in the new, information-based enterprises) (Burris, 1996, p. 68). 
Managerial masculinities exhibit substantial differences, for example, in the degree to 
which risk-taking is a significant component. However, there are similarities in the focus 
on rationality and the "control (of) others in pursuit of the instrumental goals of produc-
tion, productivity and profit" (Kerfoot &amp; Knights, 1996, p. 88). Kerfoot and Knights 
(1996, p. 83) suggest that technologies of strategic management and control are congru-
ent with "those contemporary forms of masculinity that turn everything into an object of 
conquest." 
</p>
<p>Hegemonic masculinities are not only defined in the management of business, but 
also in other organizations such as those devoted to sports (Messner, 1992), in police 
departments, and in the military. Alternative hegemonic masculinities characterize reli-
gious denominations and sects, while the worlds of university professors, medical doc-
tors, and political pundits produce their own versions of dominant masculinity. Today, as 
the values of the competitive market sector spread through industrial societies, a conver-
gence among these various masculinities toward a focus on rationality and the control of 
others in the pursuit of instrumental goals may be occurring. 
</p>
<p>Subordinated organizational masculinities have also been studied, most obviously in 
research focussed on working class jobs. Cynthia Cockburn (1983, 1985) showed how 
working class masculinity is, or was, organized around notions of physical strength, physi-
cal skill, and toughness, including the ability to withstand dangerous and dirty working 
conditions. Male solidarity based on the affirmation of these attributes valorized them in 
contrast to women who lacked them. In his study of working class boys, Paul Willis 
(1977) chronicled how this sort of masculinity was produced within the peer group, guar-
anteeing that these boys would never be other than shop floor workers, thus reproducing 
class as well as gender structures. Many other studies of working class jobs are also 
implicitly about gender, although usually this element remained implicit. David Morgan 
(1992) makes this point in a provocative rereading of some sociological classics about 
men and their work. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Organizations 187 
</p>
<p>For both male managers and workers, masculinity is (was) formed and defended 
through patterns of homosociality, men forming solidary groups that exclude women. 
Rosabeth Moss Kanter (1977) recognized this in Men and Women of the Corporation (see 
also Lipman-Blumen, 1976). Jennifer Pierce (1995) shows how these exclusions based on 
masculinity operate in law firms. Cynthia Cockburn (1985) shows how men come to-
gether in affirmations of skill and technological competence that exclude women. Male 
enclaves in organizations are also usually defined by heterosexuality, and solidarity may 
be confirmed by talk that objectifies and denigrates women while, at the same time, ex-
cluding and denigrating homosexuals. Thus gays constitute another excluded or subordi-
nate masculinity in most work organizations. Masculinity and femininity in organiza-
tional Ufe are thus linked to sexuality in multiple ways, as I discuss in the next section. 
</p>
<p>5. SEXUALITY AND BODIES 
</p>
<p>Sexuality and bodies were absent in prefeminist organization theory, although real orga-
nizational participants, of course, have bodies and sexes. The absence of bodies and sexu-
ality, components of the vision of organizations as gender-neutral, rational machines, 
contributed to masking the underlying assumption that the prototypical organization man 
was indeed a man (Acker, 1990). Bodies and sexuality are now recognized by some soci-
ologists and organizational theorists as essential aspects of organizations and work pro-
cesses (Adkins &amp; Lury, 1996; Witz et al., 1996). In a study of tourist service organiza-
tions, Adkins (1995) argues and documents that, at least in this industry, gendering of the 
relations of production is accomplished partly through sexualization (see also Hochschild, 
1983). Women workers were routinely expected to participate in sexual banter and to 
accept sexual innuendoes from male customers, managers, and co-workers. Such sexual-
ized work was part of the job: women were required to be attractive and to dress to 
emphasize their attractions. Failure to use the proper makeup and dress or refusal to 
accept the sexualization of their work relations could result in dismissal. Such require-
ments did not exist for men hired into the same jobs. One implication of this is, as she 
points out, further support for the argument that the economy is not gender neutral. 
</p>
<p>Sexuality and bodies function in many cases as resources for control by male manag-
ers and workers. For example, managers who sexualize their relationships with female 
subordinates are clearly using sexuality as a form of control. At the same time, gender, 
sexuality, and bodies can constitute problems for management. The control and manage-
ment of bodies is everywhere a management task, and that control is often done on the 
basis of gender. Women and men may have to be separated, never allowed proximity, or 
separated at certain times. This was a more pressing issue in the past than it is today, at 
least in rich industrial countries. For example, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries as women were entering the newly expanding white collar jobs, they were usu-
ally placed in women-only offices, physically segregated from men (see, e.g., Cohn, 1985). 
However, spatial segregation by gender continues. For example, in the United States and 
elsewhere, women and men must use different toilets, a symbolically important way of 
emphasizing gender difference. Management almost always controls breaks for eating, 
but often also controls toilet breaks and physical movement in the workplace in the inter-
ests of productivity; women are often controlled more rigidly than men. A widespread 
belief seems to exist that women's bodies&mdash;and psyches&mdash;tolerate physical confinement, 
repetitive tasks, and rapid movements better than do those of men. Women, therefore, are </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188 Joan Acker 
</p>
<p>often perceived as ideal employees for jobs with these requirements. Women workers 
have been confined to production lines sorting beans, packing herring, or assembling 
small objects, while men have repaired the machines, lifted the boxes, and moved about 
the workplace. Explaining such divisions of labor, an electronics firm manager in the 
Mexican Border Industrial Zone said: 
</p>
<p>We hire mostly women because they are more reliable than men; they have finer fingers, smaller 
</p>
<p>muscles and unsurpassed manual dexterity. Also, women don't get tired of repeating the same opera-
</p>
<p>tions nine-hundred times a day. (Fernandez Kelly, 1979, quoted in Green, 1983) 
</p>
<p>Managers and co-workers often target sexuality and reproduction as objects of con-
trol, but in different ways for women and men. Women are often excluded on grounds of 
reproduction and objectified on grounds of sexuality, while male sexuality pervades many 
organizations and reinforces men's organizational power (Collinson &amp; Collinson, 1989). 
Male talk about sexuality and their sense of sexual superiority can also be a source of 
cohesion that reinforces organizational stability. On the other hand, sexuality may be 
disruptive, and, according to Burrell (1984, p. 98), organizations institute mechanisms 
for control of sexuality early in their development. Women's challenges to exploitative 
male sexuality may result in management intervention, but only if the challenges are 
protected by law and thus become disruptive for the organization. The saga of the emer-
gence of sexual harassment as an organizational problem is an example. Sexual harass-
ment is an historically new concept, a product of the women's movement (MacKinnon, 
1979). Although the behavior has always existed, it was not named until 1976 when two 
U.S. surveys on its prevalence were done (Stanko, 1985, p. 61). Some women took legal 
action against employers; eventually the courts, first in the United States and later in 
some other countries, ruled that sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination. Sen-
sational and sometimes expensive cases continue to occur. Thus, a dirty secret, attesting 
to the ubiquitous sexualization of work relations, has been transformed into a major orga-
nizational problem, but one that persists and is probably more widespread than most 
studies indicate (e.g., Collinson &amp; Collinson, 1996; Thomas &amp; Kitzinger, 1994). 
</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of the complex ways that gender, bodies, and sexuality 
may be both problematic for organizational managers and resources for control and man-
agement (see also Hearn &amp; Parkin, 1987). Consideration of bodies and sexuality has 
stimulated renewed interest in emotions in work processes and in the constitution of 
gendered hierarchies (Adkins, 1995; Fineman, 1993; Pierce, 1995). Descriptions of par-
ticular organizations will reveal different ways that gender differences in bodies, emo-
tionality, and sexuality are accommodated, expressed, and employed in ongoing organi-
zational processes. 
</p>
<p>6. GENDER AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE 
</p>
<p>Historically, the gendering processes of organizing and the gendered structures of organi-
</p>
<p>zations have changed with changing organization of production, changing economic con-
</p>
<p>ditions, increasing demands by women for equity and, on occasion, equality. However, as 
</p>
<p>I argued earlier, there has also been a certain stability in the overall configuration of 
</p>
<p>gendered practices and persona. In the last 10 to 15 years, organizational change and 
</p>
<p>restructuring seem to have increased in pace and pervasiveness, stimulating questions 
</p>
<p>about the possible consequences for women, gender inequality, men, and masculinities. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Organizations 189 
</p>
<p>By framing the issue in this way, I am not suggesting that restructuring consists of ab-
stract processes that then have impacts on gender, for organizational restructuring should 
be thought of as gendered processes (Halford &amp; Savage, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Worldwide restructuring of capital and production, facilitated by new technologies, 
has included on the organizational level flattening of hierarchies, reductions in the num-
bers of middle managers, redistribution and reorganization of tasks and responsibilities, 
the development of team work, and various methods to increase flexibility (Jenson, 1989; 
Smith, 1993). The ideology justifying these changes is that they will increase productiv-
ity, efficiency, and profit. In addition, it has been argued, these changes require a new 
kind of management, one that is more humane and focussed on developing employees' 
capacities for creative engagement in their work (Calas &amp; Smircich, 1993). Such changes, 
often recommended by management consultants, are occurring in the public as well as 
the private sectors. These efforts at transformation might seem to offer possibilities for 
reductions in gender segregation and the assignment of women to subordinate jobs and 
for increasing demand for women's caring and relational capacities in management posi-
tions. Contemporary change processes are complex and various. Moreover, research on 
the gendered outcomes and the ways in which gender enters these processes is sparse. 
Therefore, conclusions about what is actually happening must be tentative (Acker, 1994). 
</p>
<p>The most consistently reported changes are reductions in hierarchy, which means, of 
course, downsizing. Some evidence exists that women fare better in flat organizations 
than in hierarchical bureaucracies (e.g., Kvande &amp; Rasmussen, 1994). However, more 
evidence indicates that reducing hierarchy as it is usually done, through downsizing middle 
management jobs and reorganizing tasks and responsibilities, has detrimental effects on 
both the quality of work and possibilities for advancement for women. Vicki Smith (1990) 
records how reducing the ranks of bank middle management was accompanied by an 
intensification of work for remaining employees and a centralization of control in the 
hands of higher management. Although she does not draw out the implications for women, 
women have increasingly filled middle management slots in most banks. Reporting on a 
study of organizational restructuring in a public sector utility, a multinational pharma-
ceutical company and a large insurance company, Jean Woodall, Christine Edwards, and 
Rosemary Welchman (1997) conclude that for women managers "the experience of orga-
nizational restructuring is akin to participation in a lottery in which they are occasionally 
winners, but usually losers" (p. 2). Restructuring led to "job losses in functions where 
women are concentrated," restricted access for women to organizational networks that 
provide opportunities for career development, and undermined formal equal opportunity 
programs. In contrast, Susan Halford and Mike Savage (1995), examining restructuring 
in banking and local government offices, suggest that these changes undermined tradi-
tional managerial masculinities and opened new possibilities for women. At the same 
time, new and more competitive managerial masculinities could be identified, while women 
managers often were "in posts which are not part of the mainstream departmental hierar-
chy" (p. 116). 
</p>
<p>Greater work loads and task variety accompanies reorganization to reduce middle 
management and "empower" lower level workers, Maile (1995) found in a study of a 
local government in Britain. I (Acker, 1994a) also found these patterns in a study of 
women's jobs in Swedish banks. Although at that time middle management was not 
being reduced, work was being reorganized on a team basis, requiring that all employees 
have a wide repertoire of skills and knowledge so that they could function interchange-
ably on the team. Their tasks were much more demanding and stressful, but, at the same </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>190 Joan Acker 
</p>
<p>time, they found their jobs more satisfying, although not more rewarding in monetary 
terms. Elin Kvande (1997) describes restructuring in a program providing care for the 
elderly in Norway in which a "new managerialism" emphasizing budgets and efficiency 
characterised new management positions filled by men. Nursing and caretaking were 
separated from budget management, and those providing care, disproportionately women, 
had to make the stressful decisions about who would receive the increasingly scarce care 
resources. 
</p>
<p>Reorganization or restructuring may also include a search for flexibility through 
management-initiated changes in the labor force from primarily full-time, permanent 
employees to a partly contingent workforce. Contingent work takes many forms, but tem-
porary and part-time work are the primary types. These workers are primarily women 
(Callaghan &amp; Hartmann, 1991). The regular use of such workers constitutes a form of 
horizontal segregation in organizations. While it is a change that employers welcome, it 
tends to create a class of workers who have no opportunities for advancement and, usu-
ally, lower pay and fewer benefits than full-time workers. 
</p>
<p>Gender may be a resource for managers in organizational restructuring (Acker, 1994b). 
A dramatic example was the downsizing of AT&amp;T in the 1970s reported by Sally Hacker 
(1979). AT&amp;T was planning to reduce its labor force because of new technology at about 
the same time that it lost a large sex discrimination suit. The company met the require-
ments of the legal settlement that it integrate women into male jobs by moving many 
women into jobs that had already been scheduled for elimination with the introduction of 
the new technology. The numbers of women declined as these formerly male jobs, as well 
some traditionally female jobs, were eliminated. 
</p>
<p>Women may be preferred for certain reconstituted management jobs that involve less 
autonomy but also require more difficult decisions made with fewer resources (Kvande, 
1997; Maile, 1995). As overall control and strategic decision-making are centralized, 
hierarchies are flattened, and career channels become constricted as a result, top manag-
ers may believe that women more readily than men accept the limitations on mobility 
possibilities, and may therefore define women as preferred employees. In the process, 
gender may be used consciously as a segregating device. For example, Reskin and Roos 
(1990, p. 51) suggested that "employers gerrymandered the sex labels of jobs that were 
feminizing for other reasons, selectively invoking sex stereotypes after they decided to 
hire more women." 
</p>
<p>7. CONCLUSION 
</p>
<p>This review of the developments in scholarship on gender and organizations necessarily 
</p>
<p>skims over an increasingly rich field of study. In conclusion, I briefly identify some impli-
</p>
<p>cations of this perspective for issues usually falling outside the study of organizations. 
</p>
<p>First, gendering organizational studies reveal some of the ways in which gender is impli-
</p>
<p>cated in the economy, for the actual practices that constitute the "economy" are, on the 
</p>
<p>whole, organizing practices. Although economic activities exist outside formal organiza-
</p>
<p>tions, in families for example, most production of goods and services is accomplished in 
</p>
<p>organizations. Markets, including financial markets, are constructed through intra- and 
</p>
<p>interorganizational processes. Distribution through wages, profits, interest, or taxes actu-
</p>
<p>ally occurs through organizational practices. People acting in organizations do the things 
</p>
<p>that we talk about as economic; gender both shapes and is created in these processes. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Organizations 191 
</p>
<p>Most academic conceptualizations of "the economy" are abstract, gender-absent models 
of market processes, choices, or value creation. Feminist economists have pointed to the gen-
dered nature of economic analysis and the male bias in economic theory (Ferber &amp; Nelson, 
1993; Kuiper &amp; Sap, 1995; Nelson, 1996) and have argued that "the economy" is 
"gendered." One way to explore the gendered nature of the economy, and to redefine what 
is meant by "economy," is through the concrete study of gendered organizing practices. 
</p>
<p>Second, gendered organizing is a critical site in which to study the intertwined pro-
cesses of class, race, and gender, as Kathy Ferguson (1994) argues. Feminists, including 
feminist social scientists, recognize that gender cannot be torn from its social contexts 
without risking distortions, including privileging gender over other components of social 
relations and identities and denying their importance in creating inequality and domina-
tion. These other components include, at a minimum, class and race. Work organiza-
tions, in particular, are the locations in which class relations are produced; class relations 
are infused with gender relations, and often with race relations, which are also repro-
duced in material and ideological forms as organizational activities are undertaken. Look-
ing at actual practices and experiences of organizing can illuminate the melding of what 
analysis has torn apart. 
</p>
<p>Third, the dangers and possibilities in the present processes of societal and global 
change cannot be fully understood without looking at transformations/nontransformations 
in gender relations in organizing. For example, the "feminization" of the world labor 
force has been a major factor in the global relocation of many industrial processes from 
high-wage countries to low-wage countries with large potential female labor forces. Par-
ticular patterns of women's subordination in the low-wage countries may become a re-
source for managers in high-wage countries, as work is subcontracted to patriarchically 
controlled family businesses or to factories employing women desperate for work at any 
wage. Changing employment patterns may have an impact on gender relations and 
gendered identities within and outside work organizations. For example, the old working 
class masculinity forged in industrial production seems in decline as production organi-
zations change. At the same time, new or reemerging entrepeneurial masculinities seem 
to be factors in the contemporary ascendancy of profit, efficiency, and competitive success 
as major values. These contrasting developments may be both positive and negative for 
both women and men, marking the weakening of one sort of dominating masculinity and 
the strengthening of another. I think that a major question to be answered in understand-
ing global economic developments is how the mobilization of various masculinities may 
be implicated. 
</p>
<p>Finally, bringing bodies and sexuality, as well as gender, into analyses of processes 
that have always been seen as disembodied and gender neutral could change our under-
standing of social structures and processes. Part of the feminist project in the social sci-
ences has been to develop alternatives to abstract, gender neutral theorizing by locating 
the starting point for investigation outside those theories, in the concrete, ordinary expe-
riences of women (and men) (Smith, 1987). Experiences, including experiences in orga-
nizations, are always located in material, concrete bodies, mediated, of course, by mean-
ings and ideologies. Organizing activities and practices are always those of actual embodied 
people, including those engaged in creating abstract systems. Making bodies and sexual-
ity, in all their concreteness, one of the places to begin our investigations is part of the 
effort to see social relations as actively produced linkages within and between many dif-
ferent and dispersed local places rather than as abstract macrostructures and processes 
imposed from above and outside. </p>

<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>In this chapter we seek to outline the general ways in which feminist work on gender and 
cultural studies have influenced each other, and how they might be brought together 
fruitfully within a sociological framework. These areas&mdash;gender studies, feminist stud-
ies, and cultural studies&mdash;are often contested and multiplicitous, and each is both dispar-
aged and championed, both within and outside of academia. It would be impossible to 
represent fully the range of ideas about the overlap between these amorphous and broad 
categories, or to summarize adequately the extent of theoretical or empirical work done 
in any one of them. Our goal is to familiarize readers with some of the primary debates 
within cultural studies, in order to explain how the feminist study of gender has shaped, 
and in turn been shaped by them. 
</p>
<p>While critical of some of its excesses, we feel that cultural studies scholarship has a 
significant contribution to make to the study of gender within all branches of feminist 
studies, especially sociology. Feminists have always been contributors to cultural studies, 
although like most mainstream disciplines and leftist academic trends, cultural studies 
began with a typically masculinist bent. We need to make some artificial distinctions in 
order to distinguish some of the dominant trends of cultural studies to which feminists 
within that area have had to respond.

</p>
<p>What do feminist studies and cultural studies have in common? Within mainstream 
academia, especially sociology, both are considered trendy fringe areas, lacking method-
ological rigor. For those sociologists for whom sociology is or ought to be a science, these 
fields are dismissed for their subjectivity and overt politicization. Even more than femi-
nism, cultural studies is seen as suspect, perhaps because of its presumed link with 
postmodern theory, which denies positivism and argues for a decentered relativism that 
many mainstream sociologists reject. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, the association of cultural studies with postmodern theory creates a clash 
between some feminist theorists and cultural studies scholars, because some feminist 
theorists decry postmodernism for its presumed denial of lived experience and the influ-
ence of broad societal structures (e.g., Bordo, 1990; Hartsock, 1990, 1996). Yet, feminist 
studies and cultural studies have much more in common than not, and each could benefit 
from knowledge of the other. Within both fields, the relationship with postmodernism 
and poststructuralism is deeply contested. Both are concerned with the negotiation of 
power, with agency and systems of social control. Both share a theoretical grounding that 
is at least vaguely Marxist; scholars in both fields tend to agree that various forms of 
social inequality should be researched, and that such research can lead to political change. 
It is this politicization that makes cultural studies so attractive for feminism. 
</p>
<p>2. DEFINING CULTURAL STUDIES 
</p>
<p>Cultural studies expands the notion of a proper area of cultural research and redefines the 
criteria for cultural evaluation. As Douglas Kellner writes: 
</p>
<p>Cultural studies insists that culture must be studied within the social relations and systems through 
</p>
<p>which culture is produced and consumed and that the study of culture is therefore intimately bound 
</p>
<p>up with the study of society, politics and economies. . . . It also subverts distinctions between "high" 
</p>
<p>and "low" culture by considering a wide continuum of cultural artifacts . , . and by refusing to erect 
</p>
<p>any specific cultural hierarchies or canons [it] allows us to examine and critically scrutinize the 
</p>
<p>whole range of culture without prior prejudices toward one or another sort of cultural text, institu-
</p>
<p>tion or practice. It also opens the way toward more differentiated political, rather than aesthetic, 
</p>
<p>valuations . . . in which one attempts to distinguish critical and oppositional from conformist and 
</p>
<p>conservative moments in a cultural artifact. (1995, pp. 6-7) 
</p>
<p>Traditional aesthetic and sociological studies of culture have not always been fully ad-
</p>
<p>equate for the political project of feminism. Traditional aesthetic studies often fail to 
</p>
<p>analyze cultural products within their social contexts, and they also often fail to recog-
</p>
<p>nize that aesthetic evaluations are always necessarily political. Traditional sociological 
</p>
<p>studies of culture, on the other hand, tend to emphasize social context over content, by 
</p>
<p>looking at culture only in structural or organizational terms. Cultural studies can provide 
</p>
<p>the feminist study of gender with a framework for analyzing in detail the content of 
</p>
<p>cultural production, while leaving it anchored to the social system from which it origi-
</p>
<p>nates. 
</p>
<p>It is difficult to define cultural studies in absolute terms, because the determination 
</p>
<p>of whether a work belongs within the field often depends upon whether someone says it 
</p>
<p>does. Scholars conduct interdisciplinary work on "culture" under a variety of academic 
</p>
<p>rubrics&mdash;Women's Studies, Media Studies, Ethnic Studies&mdash;yet there seems to be a lack 
</p>
<p>of consensus about when this work constitutes "cultural studies." Lawrence Grossberg 
</p>
<p>notes that publishers' financial considerations are sometimes the motivation for virtually 
</p>
<p>any work that could be considered cultural studies being represented as such (1996b, p. </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>The Study of Gender in Culture 197 
</p>
<p>135). As is also the case with other relatively new fields, such as queer studies, cultural 
studies seems to represent a publishing phenomenon far more than an institutional devel-
opment, as most scholars produce cultural studies work from within traditional disci-
plines (p. 135). Is cultural studies therefore simply whatever one says it is? Todd Gitlin 
(1997) adopts this very position: 
</p>
<p>The interminable examination of what exactly constitutes cuhural studies&mdash;or its subject, 'culture'&mdash; 
</p>
<p>is itself part of the problem I seek to diagnose. Rather, I hope to slip (if not cut) the Gordian knot 
</p>
<p>with the simple statement that cultural studies is the activity practiced by people who say they are 
</p>
<p>doing cultural studies, (p. 25) 
</p>
<p>As Gitlin suggests, articulating a solid definition leads one into murky waters&mdash;just as 
feminist scholars do not share a unanimous view of what constitutes feminism. 
</p>
<p>Another method of defining cultural studies (in contrast with Gitlin's voluntaristic 
strategy) is an historical approach, in which only the scholarship that derives from the 
work of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (founded in the early 1960s in 
Birmingham, England) is considered bona fide "cultural studies." This sort of scholar-
ship tends to focus on working-class subcultures, popular culture, and the media, from a 
variously defined Marxist framework. From our perspective, the voluntaristic member-
ship approach is too ambiguous and the Birmingham-derivative criterion too rigid. We 
define cultural studies as work that shares the following characteristics: interdisciplinarity, 
particularity, textuality, and antipositivism. 
</p>
<p>2.1. Interdisciplinarity 
</p>
<p>Many academic "studies" programs (such as women's studies) are multidisciplinary, in 
the sense that scholars from different disciplines contribute to the field, yet often, at the 
level of individual projects, the work resides within only one discipline (Gordon, 1995, p. 
364). Most cultural studies scholarship, by contrast, draws on the methods and insights of 
several disciplines simultaneously. The work begins with a social problem, and the method 
emanates from its particulars. At times the analysis might even be called adisciplinary, 
following a self-generated method that corresponds to no specific disciplinary vocabulary 
or debate. Indeed, many critique cultural studies scholars for their pastiche of methods, or 
their presumed ignorance of disciplinary accomplishments (Ferguson &amp; Golding, 1997). 
</p>
<p>We believe that much can be gained from cultural studies' lack of proper disciplinarity. 
The freedom to operate outside disciplines may allow critics to study culture more cre-
atively, by focusing on a subject as it presents itself socially, rather than separating out 
those aspects of the problem that correspond to disciplinary demands. As with feminist 
scholarship, we feel that the best cultural studies work is rigorously self-reflexive about 
the appropriateness of its method and resulting analysis. 
</p>
<p>2.2. Particularity 
</p>
<p>Most cultural studies scholarship is highly particular in its focus as well as its claims. 
</p>
<p>Unlike other social analysts who attempt to uncover broad structural connections, cul-
</p>
<p>tural studies scholars often take as their subject the rich details and minute patterns of a 
</p>
<p>social context, in "a microsociology of everyday life" (Inglis, 1993, p. 84). As a legacy of 
</p>
<p>its origins in Marxist historical materialism, cultural studies is founded upon conjunctural </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>198 Becca Cragin AND Wendy Simonds 
</p>
<p>analysis, an approach that is "embedded, descriptive, and historically and contextually 
specific" (Grossberg, Nelson, &amp; Treichler, 1992, p. 8). 
</p>
<p>2.3. Textuality 
</p>
<p>A closely related characteristic is the attention in cultural studies to texts. Reflecting the 
enormous influence in the past few decades of structuralism throughout the humanities, 
the dissemination of semiotics and discourse theory led to the expansion of the term 
"text" to include a wide variety of literary and visual representations. A textual analysis 
shifts the question from "What?" to "How?" through an examination of the grammar of a 
given representation. A central tenet of cultural studies, like many other fields that have 
been influenced by postmodernism and poststructuralism, is that subjects cannot be stud-
ied without considering the meaning-making (signification) process through which they 
are constituted and interpreted. 
</p>
<p>Cultural studies takes this tenet one step further, however, by expanding the notion 
of the means by which a grammar or language can be represented, including even behav-
iors and events as kinds of texts that can be read for their social (grammatical) meaning. 
Parallel to the movements within anthropology and sociology that utilize ethnographic 
methods of "thick description" to capture particular instances of "local knowledge" or 
ethnomethodological quests for "common-sense knowledge" (Clifford &amp; Marcus, 1986; 
Garfinkel, 1967; Geertz, 1973; West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987), cultural studies scholars 
analyze texts as social artifacts and social events as texts. Perhaps owing to the openness 
of the term "culture"&mdash;which can mean ideas, practices, or products&mdash;cultural studies 
scholars examine a wide range of seemingly disparate texts, such as the logic of a football 
game, the self-fashioning of young Madonna fans, or the semiotics of suntan lotion ad-
vertising (Bourdieu, 1993; Lewis, 1990; Williamson, 1986b). 
</p>
<p>2.4. Antipositivism 
</p>
<p>Cultural studies is largely based on a hermeneutic rather than a positivist mode of analy-
sis. Rather than claiming to reveal the universal meaning of interactions, cultural studies 
scholars interpret the processes through which people create culture, and culture creates 
meaning, and hence, identity. In this way, cultural studies can be seen as rooted in sym-
bolic interactionism (Blumer, 1969; Goffman 1959, 1961, 1971; Mead, 1934). Because 
the work tends to focus more frequently on the content of a cultural discourse than on the 
political economy and effects of its circulation, cultural studies scholarship is not always 
immediately and directly useful to those looking for cause and effect analyses, or for a 
means of changing society. 
</p>
<p>3. THE MISOGYNY OF REPRESENTATION 
</p>
<p>From its beginning as an academic practice in the 1960s, cultural studies has proven 
</p>
<p>itself highly amenable to the feminist study of gender, owing to its leftist orientation and 
</p>
<p>focus on culture as a significant arena of ideological struggle. One of the earliest projects </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Study of Gender in Culture 199 
</p>
<p>of second wave feminism of the 1970s was the analysis of the myriad ways in which 
patriarchy is embedded in ordinary culture. As Meaghan Morris describes it, feminism is 
"a movement of discontent with 'the everyday'" (1988c, p. 197). This engagement with 
the politics of daily life is exemplified by the classic feminist slogan, "The personal is 
political." The expression suggests not only that women's individual problems are often 
symptoms of broader social inequality, but also that the most mundane and normalized 
aspects of personal/cultural life perpetuate this inequality. 
</p>
<p>Both activist and academic feminists analyzed the breadth and depth of gender in-
equality throughout culture, in the tyranny of "common-sense" ideas about gender and in 
the representation of those ideas. Across a wide array of cultural genres, feminists began 
the initial task of naming their oppression by highlighting the ways in which everyday 
culture worked against women's best interests. This early work emphasizes uncovering 
the misogyny within representation. While some of the first studies focus on literature 
and art (Millett, 1970; Nochlin, 1971), much of it analyzes the mass media. 
</p>
<p>Many feminists believe that one of the primary causes of gender-based inequality is 
the misrepresentation of women in media images. In the early 1970s, radical feminists 
staged protests against the direct sources of that imagery, from Ladies Home Journal to 
the Miss America pageant (Echols, 1989, pp. 92-96, 195-197). One of the earUest radi-
cal feminist anthologies. Sisterhood is Powerful (Morgan, 1970), contained attacks on a 
variety of media, from news broadcasts to deodorant commercials. The activism and ad-
vocacy of liberal feminists reflect a similar concern with media images, as exemplified by 
Betty Friedan's discussion of women's magazines in The Feminine Mystique (1963). 
</p>
<p>Radical and liberal feminists shared a set of assumptions about the media that shaped 
the direction of their analyses. In most cases, feminist critics presumed that the media not 
only reflect social values but also play a major role in their dissemination. Based on 
traditional sociological media studies that use the "hypodermic," or two-step flow models 
of media effects (Adorno, 1991; Adorno &amp; Horkheimer, 1944; Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld, 1955), 
most of the early studies take for granted the notion that the media have a one-directional 
influence on viewers. These feminist critics also assumed that the media could and should 
reflect reality, rather than reify harmful stereotypes. This emphasis on stereotypes is cen-
tral to the dominant, "images of women" approach. Drawing on the content analysis 
research of the Cultural Indicators Project of the Annenberg School, feminists counted 
and catalogued media images. Feminist cultural critics concluded that women were both 
negatively represented (often this meant sexually, or in traditional, nonprofessional roles 
such as housewives) and substantially underrepresented. Gaye Tuchman went so far as to 
name this lack of representation "The Symbolic Annihilation of Women" (1978). 
</p>
<p>Feminist critics believed that improved and increased media representation of women 
would lead to social change (Walters, 1995, p. 36). The images-of-women approach de-
veloped according to the disciplinary demands of traditional communications research, 
but it met the needs of the developing political movement as well. By documenting the 
sexism in media images, feminists could do their own consciousness-raising, raise the 
larger culture's awareness of inequality, and pressure the media to change (Walters, p. 
37). This was an important step, because the idea that sexism was rampant in popular 
culture&mdash;and even that sexism was wrong&mdash;was still a position that had to be argued. 
However, despite the early consensus that cultural studies were legitimate and vital projects 
for feminism, disagreements quickly surfaced about the proper direction for analysis to 
take. </p>

</p>
<p>4. POSTSTRUCTURAL FEMINIST ANALYSES 
</p>
<p>It was not long after the images-of-women research began to be disseminated that criti-
cisms of this approach surfaced. Film studies was already well into the process of trans-
forming itself from an aesthetic discipline concerned with issues of form and auteurism 
to a highly politicized bastion of psychoanalysis and semiotics. For many feminist film 
scholars, cataloging images of women proved an unsatisfactory strategy for examining 
misogyny, because it failed to examine the very deep structures embedded in the process 
of visual signification. By focusing simply on the basic outline of an image (whether or 
not it is female, whether or not the female is nontraditional, etc.), scholars using the 
images-of-women approach seemed to be missing the deeper significance of how images 
operate. 
</p>
<p>Critics of the images-of-women approach wanted to move away from the question of 
how well women were represented because they felt that what constitutes a "positive" or 
"negative" image was never self evident, and that images could never transparently re-
flect reality. Instead of assuming they knew the reality of what women were and could 
judge the accuracy of their representation, these feminists began to evaluate the construc-
tion and circulation of "Woman" through the processes of signification. Drawing on the 
poststructuralist methods of what came to be known as "Screen Theory" (because of its 
association with the film journal Screen), critics of the images-of-women approach sug-
gested a theoretical concept to explain the status of women's representation under patri-
archy: the male gaze. The feminist version of Screen Theory was expressed most suc-
cinctly and famously in Laura Mulvey's "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" (1975). 
This article provides a poststructuralist reading of the psychological processes that take 
place in "the classic realist text," in this case the mainstream Hollywood drama. Mulvey 
presented the provocative thesis that all film viewing is male, in the sense that the classic 
realist film text evokes a psychological response in viewers that is structured around a 
patriarchal male psyche. 
</p>
<p>To understand how Mulvey came to this conclusion, one must trace the development 
of feminist film theory from structuralism and psychoanalysis. Following the work of 
linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1966), structuralism analyzes culture by determining the 
grammar of a given text. Structuralism asserts that, "Rather than reflecting an already 
existing reality, the function of language is to organise and construct our access to real-
ity" (Storey, 1993, p. 55). Therefore, a structuralist study of culture would be inextricable 
from a study of its grammar, both linguistic and logical. Structuralism posits grammar as 
engaging in a series of binary oppositions, such as nature/culture, male/female, etc., out 
of which meaning is constructed. According to the structuralist view, meaning is always 
relational and contextual, and yet structuralist readings tend to be very absolute, presum-
ing that there is one, fixed meaning of a text which can be perfectly outlined by the critic 
(Seiter, 1992, p. 63). 
</p>
<p>Poststructuralism, on the other hand, focuses not on the certainty and fixity of mean-
ing but on its fluidity, ruptures, and excesses. In combining structuralism and psycho-
analysis, the work of Jacques Lacan (1977a, 1977b) has been particularly important for 
film studies. Lacan reinterprets Freud's stages of psychological development in linguistic 
terms, explaining how identity formation itself is a product and process of language. For 
example, Lacan links the Oedipal phase of psychological development (in which the 
child learns to differentiate itself from the mother) to the acquisition of language (I am 
me, not you). In the pre-Oedipal phase, the child has no clear sense of where her own </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Study of Gender in Culture 201 
</p>
<p>boundaries end and her mother's begin. The loss of that close bond with the original 
source of pleasure represents a profound lack, which is also reflected in the assumption of 
language (since saying one thing always involves repressing some aspect of its opposite). 
From this perspective, identity is a necessary fiction, a narrative position that is continu-
ally asserted to establish an ever-fragile, fictive whole. Yet the lack (the loss of the mother, 
the subconscious elided in the assertion of ego, the inability of language to translate a 
reality) is always present. 
</p>
<p>According to Lacan, the cores of our identities are not individual, private essences 
but social, linguistic structures. Just as structuralists described the construction of culture 
according to linguistic logic, poststructuralists describe the construction of self according 
to that same cultural logic. Because they believe that the very contours of our psyches are 
embedded within language, which is embedded within culture, poststructuralist critics 
trace the connections between psychological, textual, and cultural structures. It is within 
this theoretical framework that Mulvey could claim that "the gaze is male." Mulvey be-
lieves that the cinema is structured around men's psychological needs (owing to the male 
domination of the film industry), in a way that is harmful to women. Building on the 
Lacanian idea that cultural formations reflect and answer psychological formations, Mulvey 
states that all viewing positions have been masculinized, so that anyone viewing a film 
becomes caught up in "the male gaze." This masculinization occurs through film's invo-
cation of two distinct types of visual pleasure: scopophilia and fetishism. 
</p>
<p>Scopophilia, or voyeurism, is enhanced by the nature of the viewing experience. The 
brightness of the screen and the darkness of the theater position the spectator as if he is 
spying on the characters. In this analysis, the ability to look is associated with cultural 
power, and the fact that the film's characters do not know they are being watched (since 
they almost never address the camera directly) enhances the spectatorial sense of power. 
Films also offer the pleasure of fetishism, the spectator's enchantment with the focus on 
women's bodies. Women's bodies serve in the film as sexual objects, there to receive the 
gaze of the camera, the male characters, and the spectator. 
</p>
<p>Mulvey sees these pleasures as distinctly related to the needs of the male psyche. The 
gaze of the camera addresses a male viewer, as the film is created for and from his point 
of view. In Western culture, according to Mulvey and sociologist John Berger (1972), the 
act of looking conveys and consolidates male power. Men are defined as men by their 
ability to look at women, and women, in turn, are defined as subordinates in part by their 
inability to look, their objectification. Since fetishization and voyeurism serve primarily 
as mechanisms for assuaging castration anxiety, the spectator the film constructs is pre-
sumed to be male. Whether through the voyeurism of film noir's investigation of female 
sexuality, or through the fetishism of the display of women's bodies as spectacle, in the 
psychology of film Woman can only represent lack. 
</p>
<p>Men, of course, also experience this lack (the inadequacies of language and loss of 
the mother mentioned earlier), but they project it onto women, who come to represent 
both the loss of the phallus (castration) as well as the phallus itself (fetishization). All 
that film offers to women, according to Mulvey, is the masochism of accepting the male 
gaze (by identifying with the female characters). The men in the film, the men behind the 
camera, and the men in the audience embody looking, and demonstrate the male gaze, 
while the women in the film, and in the audience, simply embody "to-be-looked-at-ness" 
(p. 19). 
</p>
<p>This understanding of the gendered nature of film pleasure has been highly useful 
for feminists. Mulvey's use of psychoanalysis helps explain not only why cinema is so </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>202 Becca Cragin AND Wendy Simonds 
</p>
<p>compelling, but more importantly, why men objectify women (Smelik, 1995, p. 69). Rather 
than viewing women as a natural group that is inaccurately represented in film, 
poststructuralist feminists see women as a group that is constituted and defined by repre-
sentation. Poststructuralist feminists conceive of womanhood not as biological difference 
from men but as a psychological effect of male domination. Drawing on the psychoana-
lytic analysis found in Teresa de Lauretis's Alice Doesn't: Feminism, Semiotics, Cinema 
(1984), Ann Smelik explains why signification is so important for an understanding of 
women's subordination: 
</p>
<p>Telling stories is one of the ways of reproducing subjectivity in any given culture. Each story derives 
</p>
<p>its structure from the subject's desire ("the hero"). Narrative structures are defined by an Oedipal 
</p>
<p>desire: the desire to know origin and end. Sexual desire is intimately bound up with the desire for 
</p>
<p>knowledge, that is, the quest for truth. The desire to solve riddles is a male desire par excellence. 
</p>
<p>because the female subject is herself the riddle. "Woman" is the question ("what does woman want?") 
</p>
<p>and can hence not ask the question nor make her desire intelligible (1995, pp. 73-74). 
</p>
<p>The problem for women is not just that men objectify women and that this objectification 
is then represented in cultural texts, but also that the psychological imperatives that ini-
tially give rise to these texts are solidified and then replicated by them. Our deepest 
subconscious desires become structured in patriarchal ways, so that what we want and 
who we understand ourselves to be, as men and women, are shaped in ways that are 
extremely harmful to women. 
</p>
<p>Psychoanalytic, poststructuralist criticism dominated feminist film studies of the 
1970s and much of the 1980s. It provided a vocabulary feminists could use to explore the 
psychological structures through which cultural texts and misogyny operate, and it paid 
more attention to the detail of texts than the images-of-women approach. From the begin-
ning of feminist media studies, feminists were deeply divided over not just how they 
would study images of women, but also what "images" and "women" were, and what the 
purpose of feminist cultural criticism should be. Caught between positivist social science 
and structuralism. Screen theory and the images-of-women approach were irreconcilable 
strategies for the study of gender, and the debates across the divide were strenuous. 
</p>
<p>5. THE BIRMINGHAM SCHOOL 
</p>
<p>Within cultural studies, divisive debates surrounding gender and structuralism' were tak-
ing place as well. As feminists became involved in cultural studies, they brought with 
them a strong commitment to study women's experiences. For example, in the early 1970s 
feminists affiliated with the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies 
(CCCS), such as Angela McRobbie, Charlotte Brunsdon, Rosalind Coward, and Dorothy 
Hobson, insisted that the Center scholars make gender an integral part of their analyses 
(see Brunsdon, 1996). This push was so emphatic and transformative that Hall labels it 
an "interruption" in which feminists literally "broke into cultural studies" (1992, pp. 
282-283). This desire to document the previously ignored or devalued realm of women's 
cultural experience, as well as the perceived excesses of the Mulvian "male gaze," had

<p>important consequences for feminist cultural studies scholars. A new branch of feminist 
cultural studies formed, in rebellion against the idea that women are not actively involved 
in cultural reception. 
</p>
<p>Until this point, the field had been dominated by studies of male subcultures. The 
exclusion of women was due, in part, to a certain ambivalence toward femininity that has 
surfaced repeatedly throughout the history of cultural studies, as popular culture itself has 
been envisioned as "feminine" (Joyrich, 1996, p. 30; Modleski, 1986). The dearth of 
studies on girls and women could also be explained by the Marxist legacy of cultural 
studies. Scholars made class central (to the exclusion of other variables such as race, 
gender, and sexual identity), and focused on "public modes of resistance," which typi-
cally involve male actors (Joyrich, 1996, p. 13). Women and girls have long been seen by 
social science researchers as inheriting class from men (fathers or husbands). For the 
most part, men doing Marxist cultural studies view men as purely classed and ungendered, 
and women as indirectly classed and tainted by gender. In addition to ignoring women's 
subculture, McRobbie notes that male scholars often interpret the subcultures they did 
study in ways that were troublesome. Lacking any kind of analysis of gender inequality, 
and overidentifying with their subjects, they often valorize rather than critique the op-
pressive aspects of masculinity (such as alcohol abuse and violence) (1981, p. 114). In a 
criticism of the work of Dick Hebdige and Paul Willis, McRobbie offers the reminder that 
male subcultures which oppress women cannot accurately be called resistant of the values 
of the dominant culture. 
</p>
<p>6. AUDIENCE STUDIES 
</p>
<p>In the 1980s, feminist audience studies developed within and parallel to a growing trend 
among cultural studies scholars to examine the reception of culture. Cultural studies as a 
whole moved away from the strict interpretations of meaning required by structuralism 
toward a more fluid understanding of the impact of ideology on culture. Two crucial 
concepts underpinning this theoretical shift are Antonio Gramsci's "hegemony" and 
Ernesto Laclau's "articulation." Gramsci's (1971) concept of hegemony explains why the 
masses (workers) do not rise up and challenge their economic exploitation. This ap-
proach states that elite classes rule not by imposing ideology on the masses, but by woo-
ing them. As the working classes come to accept cultural messages which are framed 
according to the interests of their oppressors, they are less likely to rebel. The theory of 
hegemony also entails moving away from the Marxist notion of base/superstructure, as 
not all aspects of a culture perfectly reflect the needs of the economic structure from 
which they emanate. Some ideas oppose structure, and some ideas don't do anything, at 
least not in the service of capitalism. Culture is fluid, contradictory, and a site for struggle. 
</p>
<p>Laclau (1977) develops the concept of articulation, initially presented by Gramsci 
and Althusser, to explain both how cultural and economic formations are relatively au-
tonomous, and how elites use culture to maintain their hegemony. Laclau's concept of 
articulation depicts ideology not as a misrepresentation of reality, but rather as a link 
between people's experience of reality and their interpretation of it. The ruling classes 
win hegemony not by imposing a single worldview, but by articulating a relationship 
between socioeconomic conditions and ruling-class philosophy. In essence, elites define 
what the "problem" of society currently is, in a way that smoothes over contradictions 
and appeals to working class "common sense" (Slack, 1996, p. 121). This theory relates </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>204 Becca Cragin AND Wendy Simonds 
</p>
<p>cultural values to political-economic structures, but not in a predetermined way. Ideology 
and experience are constantly in contradiction&mdash;both internally and with each other. They 
must be continually rearticulated for the ruling classes to dominate (Hall, 1996, p. 43-44). 
</p>
<p>Cultural studies scholars draw on Gramsci and Laclau to argue that cultural mean-
ing is not a static "given" embedded in economic structures or in texts, but a process. 
They study how people use texts, arguing that the act of reception produces meaning. In 
an important early audience study, David Morley (1980) attempts to test Hall's "encod-
ing/decoding" model of media reception on television viewers. Based on a model of ar-
ticulation (Slack, 1996, p. 123-124), Hall argues that meaning resides in the production, 
distribution, and reception of texts (1980b). Morley's audience study was built on a previ-
ous textual analysis (Brunsdon &amp; Morley, 1978) of the British newsmagazine program 
Nationwide, which showed how hegemonic or preferred readings were encoded in the 
show through its use of "the everyday" and common sense to support the dominant ideol-
ogy. Morley was less successful in his,jOwn study at analyzing the decoding of the text, 
however. As he frankly admits, viewers' interpretations of the show did not always corre-
spond as strongly to their class positions as he had predicted they would. In fact, he finds 
that viewers shifted many times between "preferred," "negotiated," and "resistant" read-
ings, often transgressing supposed class boundaries. Morley concluded that a more de-
tailed model of decoding was necessary to explain the viewing process, and that variables 
such as race and gender needed to be taken more fully into account; someone who is 
socially subordinate in one regard (e.g., in terms of his or her class position), and there-
fore somewhat more likely to express a resistant or counterhegemonic reading, may in 
other regards be socially dominant (by virtue of race or gender) (1992, p. 135). 
</p>
<p>While his Nationwide study was less conclusive than Morley had initially hoped, it 
nonetheless signals a fundamental shift away from structuralism into a more fluid and 
reader-based understanding of culture. Instead of searching for the meaning of the text, 
cultural studies scholars queried: What do audiences do with texts? How does reception 
matter in terms of culture at large? A series of related debates were taking place at the 
same time within feminism, focused on women viewers/cultural consumers. In response 
to what many perceived as the rigidity and essentialism of gaze theory, which left no 
conceptual space for any consideration of what a female gaze might look like, some femi-
nists abandoned the quest to extricate or explicate the Woman trapped in the Text, to 
study actual women viewers/readers/interpreters of culture. 
</p>
<p>Janice Radway's Reading the Romance: Women, Patriarchy, and Popular Literature 
(1984) is perhaps the most influential feminist study of reception of the 1980s. Based on 
her observations of interactions among a community of romance novel readers, in addi-
tion to her analysis of the novels themselves, Radway concludes that what the women 
gain from the novels is fairly complex. On the one hand, the content is frequently mis-
ogynist, reaffirming conventional gender relations and encouraging women to interpret 
men's callousness, and even violence, as desperate cries for yet more patience and love. 
On the other hand, the act of reading itself functions as more than regressive escape. It 
ultimately serves as a protest against the gender inequities readers face in their daily 
lives, because they commit time and resources to nurturing themselves instead of catering 
only to the needs of their families. While Radway acknowledges that their reading did not 
lead the women to engage in active collective resistance to their oppression, it does repre-
sent a recognition, however unconscious, that they deserve more attention and respect 
from men. Studying their use of romance novels led Radway to quite different conclu-
sions than she might have drawn had she only given her own readings of the texts. </p>
<p/>

<p>The Study of Gender in Culture 205 
</p>
<p>Radway's ambivalent interpretation of the ultimate political meaning of romance 
reading for women reflected a growing tension among feminist cultural scholars (and 
among cultural studies scholars in general). Once they began studying audiences, they 
witnessed a great deal of viewing pleasure generated from the reception of politically 
regressive texts. How, then, should one interpret this phenomenon? What were the poli-
tics of pleasure? Reception studies reignited or reframed a feminist debate regarding 
pornography that had been circulating for some time, about the twin poles of pleasure and 
danger (Snitow, Stansell, &amp; Thompson, 1983; Vance, 1984). As postmodernism swept 
over the Academy and postfeminism flooded the airwaves, feminist ethnographers began 
asking themselves how they should interpret the guilty pleasures of mass cultural con-
sumption. 
</p>
<p>7. POSTMODERNISM, PLEASURE, AND RESISTANCE 
</p>
<p>Just as there were deep anxieties in political movements of the 1980s about the meaning 
of postfeminism and post-Marxism, in the academy postmodernism was a phenomenon 
that had to be responded to in some fashion. Whether it was an historical condition, an 
architectural style, or a media creation depended upon one's point of view; nevertheless, 
many academic disciplines were grappling (and still grapple) with the same questions 
about the usefulness or threat of postmodern theory. Within cultural studies, scholars 
disagree about the implications of postmodernism for their interpretations of culture. 
Postmodern theory exacerbates a tension that had long existed between critics who ex-
pressed varying degrees of pessimism about capitalist culture. Some scholars, such as 
Frederic Jameson (1984), bitterly critique postmodernism as a decadent development of 
late capitalism, in which most aspects of life have become hopelessly commodified. Most 
scholars writing about postmodernism, however, tend to be, if not celebratory, then at 
least markedly neutral about the subject. 
</p>
<p>The most significant aspects of a postmodern era, according to postmodern theo-
rists, relate to the overwhelming presence of media in daily life, the breakdown of En-
lightenment rationality, and the focus on particularity. Jean-Fran&sect;ois Lyotard heralds the 
death of the metanarrative, the end of any pretensions of universalism (1984). Baudrillard 
contributes the idea of the simulacra, the notion that all culture now simply recirculates 
existing ideas: with originality defunct, everything is simply simulation (1983). Michel 
Foucault incorporates his concept of power/knowledge into the term "discourse," ex-
panding on the interrelationship between materiality and language, and proposing a more 
diffuse model of power than the traditional Marxist notion of bourgeois domination of the 
masses (1990). All of these theoretical developments fueled a growing tendency among 
cultural studies scholars in the 1980s to focus on the aesthetics of style over the politi-
cized interpretation of ideology, and on the fluid nature of power and meaning. It became 
difficult for scholars to continue to produce macrolevel, political analyses at all, for fear 
of erecting their own metanarratives. 
</p>
<p>Some critics note that cultural studies does in fact have much in common with 
postmodernism (Chen, 1996; Hebdige, 1996). For example, Laclau's theory of articula-
tion, and his later work with Chantal Mouffe deconstructing the stability/notion of class 
(1985), while originally linking materiality and textuality, paves the way for cultural 
critics who believe there is little if any relationship between the structure of texts and the 
structure of society (Slack, 1996, p. 121; Sparks, 1996, p. 89). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>206 Becca Cragin AND Wendy Simonds 
</p>
<p>While some feminists speak out about what they see as the excesses of postmodern 
theory (Bordo, 1990; Hartsock, 1990, 1996), others welcome the new kinds of analyses 
that postmodernism offers (Barrett &amp; Phillips, 1992; Butler, 1990; Flax, 1990). Femi-
nism had already been moving in the direction of breaking down grand narratives of 
identity (such as the notion that women constitute a natural group whose members share 
similar interests) to focus on the specificity of race, class, and sexual identity.^ For some 
feminists, then, postmodernism's emphasis on fragmentation and social construction al-
lows a way to theorize this specificity without reifying differences of identity into natural-
ized categories. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps because Mulvey's notion of the gaze completely dismissed the possibility of 
women's pleasure, many among the next generation of feminist scholars responded by 
searching out pleasure. One of the most common textual strategies is reading against the 
grain, in which critics search for moments of excess and contradiction within traditional 
texts, such as melodramatic films and those by Hitchcock (Byars, 1991; Modleski, 1988). 
This approach represents quite a departure from Mulvey's assumption that only experi-
mental feminist films that radically broke with film conventions could be nonoppressive. 
From this perspective, even mainstream, sexist films contain the seeds of their own undo-
ing or deconstruction. 
</p>
<p>Just as Radway found that reading romance novels was not a masochistic activity for 
women, however misogynist the texts might be, other feminist ethnographers also dis-
covered that the relationship between texts and viewers' values was complex. For ex-
ample, len Ang (1985) has written about Dutch fans of Dallas, and the uses they made of 
this 1980s American nighttime soap opera. Ang analyzes letters viewers wrote to her in 
response to a newspaper ad she placed. She identifies three groups of viewers, all of 
whom have differing relationships to the "ideology of mass culture," the value system 
that dismisses shows such as Dallas as trash. Dallas-lo\ers, Dallas-haXers, and ironists 
(those who liked mocking it) all express some form of negativity toward the show, yet all 
of them enjoy watching it. 
</p>
<p>Ang gives a very nuanced reading of the ways in which ideology (viewers' negativ-
ity toward popular culture) can operate independently from behavior (their viewing of it), 
as well as the possibility that pleasure can operate relatively independently of polities. 
Cora Kaplan (1986) explores the pleasure of watching a miniseries such as The Thombirds, 
where the breaking of taboos and transgression of "reality" allows women viewers to 
experience temporary freedom from oppressive social norms. Viewers can enjoy texts 
without necessarily subscribing to their implicit values, because of the roles that irony 
and fantasy play in our reception and enjoyment of texts. 
</p>
<p>Dorothy Hobson's influential study of the producers and viewers of the British soap 
opera. Crossroads (1982), deals with another aspect of women's viewing pleasure for 
which they are often disparaged&mdash;their supposed confusion of soap opera characters with 
real people. Rather than reflecting an inability to distinguish reality from fantasy, she 
argues that viewers' interest in the characters reflects an intentional suspension of reality 
in order to engage with the text on the level of fantasy. The identification with the soap 
opera fantasy is not an all-or-nothing process, where one either believes (correctly) that 
the stories are fabrications, or believes (quite naively) that they are real. The viewers are 
well aware that they are not watching a documentary, yet soap operas can still engage 
</p>
<p>' Some feminist scholars have argued that feminist studies are postmodern studies, and that postmoderism has 
</p>
<p>appropriated much feminist work without acknowledging this debt (Morris, 1988b; Skeggs, 1995, p. 193). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Study of Gender in Culture 207 
</p>
<p>their interest and even their emotions. The emotions they express are not in response to 
the made-up situations in the characters' lives, but to situations in the viewers' own lives 
that soap operas evoke. 
</p>
<p>This insight is an important corrective, not only to the idea that soap opera viewers 
(or female viewers in general) lack intelligence and judgment, but also to the idea that 
audiences passively receive the "message" of a text. In talking with viewers of Personal 
Best and The Color Purple, Elizabeth Ellsworth (1986) and Jacqueline Bobo (1988), 
respectively, observe that viewers actively and idealistically revise the films to create for 
themselves pleasurable viewing. 
</p>
<p>Both authors draw a connection between this revision and the viewers' marginal 
status in mainstream U.S. culture as African-American and lesbian women. Viewers ig-
nore those aspects of the film which they feel are racist and homophobic, and in the case 
of the Personal Best viewers, even rewrite (that is, read against the grain) the plots to 
create a more satisfying ending. Marginalized both as members of society and as film 
viewers (since they rarely see gratifying representations of themselves in film), they cre-
ate for themselves the kinds of films they want to see. Recent scholarship on fan clubs 
explores the extent to which viewers take an active role in cultural consumption, forming 
fan communities as well as creating their own texts (Lewis, 1990; Penley, 1992). 
</p>
<p>Many feminist cultural studies scholars are relieved to have more theoretical space 
in which to consider the effects of cultural texts, instead of having the answer preor-
dained by theoretical or political commitments. Some of the same feminists who focus on 
the pleasures of reception are also some of the strongest critics of work that is perceived 
as too uncritical or too optimistic about the joys of viewing (Joyrich, 1996; Modleski, 
1991; Morris, 1988a; Williamson, 1986a). While still divided about the extent to which 
viewers can resist ideology, or the extent to which our pleasure is implicated by our 
politics, most feminist cultural critics nevertheless know that there is always, for women, 
some danger mixed with the pleasure. In the late 1980s a whole host of reception-ori-
ented studies emerged, focusing on historical and cultural context, and "women's genres," 
such as soap operas, melodramas, and self-help books (Brown, 1990; Byars, 1991; Gamman 
&amp; Marshment, 1988; Gledhill, 1987; Press, 1991; Pribram, 1988; Simonds, 1992, 1996; 
Spigel, 1992; Spigel, &amp; Mann, 1992; Stacey, 1994). 
</p>
<p>8. CULTURAL STUDIES, FEMINIST STUDIES, AND SOCIOLOGY 
</p>
<p>One of the main contributions feminism has made to the study of culture has been the 
</p>
<p>understanding that everything is gendered; gender is not merely one layer of meaning, 
</p>
<p>but is central to the construction and- organization of all meaning. Rather than simply 
</p>
<p>adding women to studies of culture, feminists consider the ways in which culture is fun-
</p>
<p>damentally gendered. 
</p>
<p>Empirical cultural studies have much in common, methodologically, with feminist 
</p>
<p>studies. Traditional sociological method presumes a distanced observer, and casts re-
</p>
<p>search participants ("subjects") as untrustworthy obstacles in the quest for truth. Femi-
</p>
<p>nist scholars ask: Can we forge nonexploitive relationships with those we study? What do 
</p>
<p>we do with the interpretations of their own lives that people offer us? How might we craft 
</p>
<p>the research process to preserve the integrity of what people tell us? What do we do about 
</p>
<p>the Marxist notion of false consciousness, which resonates (ironically) with the conven-
</p>
<p>tional sociological researcher's view of subjects? (See Acker, Barry, &amp; Esseveld, 1996; </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>208 Becca Cragin AND Wendy Simonds 
</p>
<p>Fonow &amp; Cook, 1991; Gorelick, 1996; Harding &amp; Hintikka, 1983; Krieger, 1991; Oakley, 
1981; Reinharz, 1992; Roberts, 1981; Smith, 1996; Stacey, 1988). Many feminist schol-
ars draw on notions of grounded theory and the social construction of knowledge (Berger 
&amp; Luckmann, 1966; Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1973) to justify flexible research agendas and 
personalized relationships with those we research. Feminist scholars, like cultural stud-
ies scholars, are concerned with negotiating the nuanced interstices of complicity and 
resistance. Similarly, feminist scholars ruminate upon ways to link theory and practice, 
and to make accounts of both less exclusionary to nonacademics (see, e.g., essays in 
Gottfried, 1996). These quests are quintessentially sociological. 
</p>
<p>Cultural studies are, in fact, enmeshed in sociology, a polyglot descendant of Marx-
ism, Weberian theory, the Frankfurt school, symbolic interaction, ethnomethodology, com-
munications research, and critical media studies. From conceptualizations of art as cul-
tural production (Becker, 1982; Griswold, 1986; Wolff, 1981) to examinations of the 
social construction of identity (Blumer, 1969; Goffman, 1959, 1961; Grodin &amp; Lindlof, 
1996), from macro-level theory about base and superstructure (Williams, 1958) to micro-
level deconstruction of individual and group behavior (Garfinkel, 1967) to conversation 
analysis (Fisher, 1993; Mishler, 1986; Moerman, 1988; Riessman, 1990)&mdash;cultural stud-
ies may be seen as having sociological roots that run deep. 
</p>
<p>Cultural studies, like feminist gender studies, may also be seen as contesting main-
stream or positivistic sociology, from rational choice theory (which posits that individu-
als utilize cost-benefit analyses in all decision-making) to uses and gratifications re-
search (which seeks to articulate media effects on users). Sonia Livingstone suggests that 
the quantitative/qualitative split within sociological media studies may be overcome now 
that cultural studies scholars (or critical media studies) have refocused on reception, and 
now that positivists&mdash;former uses-and-gratifications proponents&mdash;have begun to recon-
sider cause-effect claims (1990). Drawing on Katz (1980), she describes media studies as 
having always "oscillat[ed] between conceptions of powerful media and powerful view-
ers" (p. 8). However, the way the media operate cannot be reduced to this simple di-
chotomy. Agency and social control, political economy, and textual detail all are impor-
tant, and all must be taken into account. Wendy Griswold's concept of the cultural diamond 
provides a clear model for thinking about culture. At its corners are the four elements 
necessary for a complete understanding of culture: social world, creator, receiver, and 
cultural object, with each corner connected to each of the others (1987, p. 1994). 
</p>
<p>In our view, the most useful cultural studies scholarship socially grounds cultural 
phenomena, and draws on a variety of critical approaches, from historiography to psy-
choanalysis to ethnography, integrating many variables&mdash;from race, class, and gender to 
nationality, age, and sexual identity. While the rigor, interdisciplinarity, and high quality 
of much feminist cultural studies work is inspiring, it raises the question of how well we 
mere mortals can juggle so many scholarly demands. While this kind of grounded work is 
difficult to do, however, it is vital, in order for our analyses to be productive interroga-
tions of the politics of daily life, rather than merely entertaining readings of "resistance."

</p>
<p>Gender Socialization 
</p>
<p>JEAN STOCKARD 
</p>
<p>As children grow up they form a general sense of self and the ability to relate to others 
</p>
<p>and play a part in society. In this process they also develop beliefs about the roles and 
</p>
<p>expectations that are associated with each sex group (gender roles) and a self-identity as 
</p>
<p>a member of one sex group or the other (gender identity). This chapter describes theories 
</p>
<p>and research that are related to this general process of gender socialization. 
</p>
<p>The notion of socialization is very broad. For instance, scholars may discuss occupa-
</p>
<p>tional socialization, religious socialization, political socialization, or socialization to school. 
</p>
<p>Yet, gender socialization appears to be one of the most basic aspects of this large and 
</p>
<p>complex process. In part this reflects the fact that children's realization that they are male 
</p>
<p>or female tends to come at a fairly young age. Long before children understand the nature 
</p>
<p>of religious groups, occupations, or schooling, they realize that there are two sex groups 
</p>
<p>and that they belong to one of these groups. The centrality of gender socialization also 
</p>
<p>reflects the fact that our society, and all societies known to social scientists, are gendered. 
</p>
<p>People throughout the world recognize that there are different sex groups and they assign 
</p>
<p>different roles and responsibilities to members of these groups, as well as different re-
</p>
<p>wards and values. 
</p>
<p>The theories used to analyze gender socialization were primarily developed to deal 
</p>
<p>with socialization in general. That is, theories that can explain how we develop a general 
</p>
<p>sense of self or how we learn roles and expectations associated with school or work are 
</p>
<p>also used to account for the development of gender identity and gender role expectations. 
</p>
<p>Theory and research regarding socialization is also multidisciplinary, reflecting work in 
</p>
<p>academic psychology and psychoanalysis, as well as sociology. Because gender identity 
</p>
<p>and views of gender roles first begin to appear at very young ages, much of this work has 
</p>
<p>focused on children.

</p>
<p>As in all areas of research, analyses of socialization have developed and changed 
over the years. As empirical findings have accumulated some theories have tended to fall 
by the wayside and new theories have appeared (Maccoby, 1992). My discussion of gen-
der socialization will follow a rough chronological order, describing the early tradition of 
social learning theory, the rise of cognitive developmental theory, and the more recent 
appearance of gender schema theory. I will then describe work that focuses on childhood 
cultures and the role of peer groups and, finally, examine psychoanalytic explanations of 
the role of parents in gender socialization. Before reviewing each of these approaches, I 
briefly discuss the influence of biological factors on gender development. 
</p>
<p>1. BIOLOGY AND GENDER SOCIALIZATION 
</p>
<p>In recent years sociologists and other scientists have become increasingly cognizant of 
the complex relationships between biological, psychological, environmental, and social 
factors in individuals' lives and development. This work suggests that infants are not a 
tabula rasa on which "society" simply writes a message. Instead, children appear to enter 
the world genetically prepared to interact with others and predisposed to exhibit certain 
behavioral tendencies. For instance, a growing body of literature reports data on identical 
twins, some of whom have been raised together and some apart. These studies document 
the very large role of genetic background in explaining individuals' personality traits, 
health, history of mental illness, and even social and political attitudes (Rowe, 1994, pp. 
57-93; Udry, 1995). Humans also appear to be biologically "programmed" to respond to 
others in a social manner&mdash;to learn language and to interact with others in their environ-
ment (Schore, 1994). 
</p>
<p>At the same time, research increasingly documents the ways in which social experi-
ences influence biological characteristics and capabilities. For instance, without proper 
stimulation children's intellectual and social development can be sharply curtailed (Schore, 
1994). Similarly, excessive exposure to danger or stress can alter neural pathways in the 
brain and the ways that we respond to social situations (Massey, 1996, p. 408). Socializa-
tion, the way that individuals come to develop an idea of their roles within a society, 
necessarily involves an interplay between biological and social factors. 
</p>
<p>It is logical to expect that biological factors are involved, to at least some extent, in 
gender socialization. Males and females experience different exposure to hormones pre-
natally, again at adolescence, and during adulthood. Although evidence is far from com-
plete, data from studies based on both animal and human populations indicate that varia-
tions in brain structure resulting from these different hormonal dosages can account for 
some behavioral differences between males and females, such as average levels of aggres-
siveness and nurturance (Rowe, 1994, pp. 174-179; Stockard &amp; Johnson, 1992, pp. 126-
130). One explanation for these differences comes from the developing field of evolution-
ary psychology. This perspective takes a very long view of human history and suggests 
that human behaviors and traits reflect adaptations that allowed us to survive in the often 
dangerous and unsure environments in which humans evolved. To the extent that there 
are innate differences between the sex groups, these reflect the different adaptive prob-
lems that faced men and women (Buss, 1994, 1995a, b; Buss &amp; Malamuth, 1996; Kenrick 
&amp; Trost, 1993; Rowe, 1994, pp. 179-188). 
</p>
<p>Even with such biological influences, many, if not most, aspects of gendered behav-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Socialization 217 
</p>
<p>ior probably result from social influences. This can be seen most clearly in the ways in 
which gender roles vary from one society to another. Although gender differences in a 
few social roles and behavioral tendencies (most notably those related to child rearing 
and aggression) tend to be found in all societies that have been studied (Whiting &amp; Edwards, 
1988), there appears to be a great deal of variation in the gendered nature of other social 
roles and behaviors from one society to another (e.g.. Best &amp; Williams, 1993; Stockard &amp; 
Johnson, 1992, pp. 74-95). In addition, individuals vary in the extent to which they 
adhere to gender roles and exhibit gender typed behaviors, and the nature of these roles 
and behaviors have changed over time and can vary from one setting to another. 
</p>
<p>The extent to which physiological factors influence differences between the sex groups 
is an active and contentious issue and will probably not be resolved any time soon (e.g., 
Eagly, 1995a, b; Hyde &amp; Plant, 1995; Jacklin, 1989; Maracek, 1995; Sternberg, 1993). 
While acknowledging the possibility that gender identity and gender roles may be influ-
enced by biological factors, I focus in this chapter on theory and research that have ad-
dressed the social influences on gender-related behaviors and self-image. This work ex-
amines not just differences between average characteristics of males and females, but also 
variations within sex groups&mdash;why some males and some females are more likely than 
others to adhere strongly to traditional gender norms. 
</p>
<p>2. SOCIAL LEARNING THEORY 
</p>
<p>The broad area of social learning theory developed from the tradition of stimulus-re-
sponse theory or behaviorism. For many years work in this area focused on reinforce-
ments, suggesting that children develop sex-typed behaviors because other people rein-
force activities that conform to expectations for their sex group and do not reinforce those 
that do not conform. Because children spend so much of their early years within the 
family, much of the research in this area focused on parent-child interactions. This work 
has produced relatively little support for the notion that differential reinforcement can 
account for children's gender-typed behavior (Fagot, 1985; Huston, 1983, pp. 441^42; 
Serbin, Tonick, &amp; Sternglanz, 1977; Serbin, Connor, &amp; Citron, 1978). Studies of paren-
tal behaviors show that parents tend to reinforce some gender differences in the toys 
children play with (Block, 1984; Fagot &amp; Hagan, 1985; Fagot &amp; Leinbach, 1987; Fagot, 
Hagan, Leinbach, &amp; Kronsberg, 1985; Huston, 1983). However, in other areas, such as 
encouragement of achievement or dependency, warmth of interactions, restrictiveness, 
and disciplinary practices, parents tend to treat boys and girls similarly (Lytton &amp; Rom-
ney, 1991). 
</p>
<p>By the 1960s, the social learning tradition had broadened to include the notion of 
modeling, suggesting that children develop sex-typed behaviors because they choose to 
model or copy behaviors of other males or females (Maccoby, 1992, pp. 1007-1011; 
Stockard &amp; Johnson, 1992, pp. 165-167). Note that while the notion of reinforcement 
focuses on how agents of socialization, such as parents, influence children's behaviors, 
the idea of modeling tends to focus on the active role of the targets of socialization and 
their ability to imitate the actions of specific agents. Tests of this theory have generally 
involved settings where a series of models have been presented to young children. As 
with the idea of reinforcement, relatively little support has been found for the importance 
of modeling in the development of gender identity or adherence to gender roles. For </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>instance, parents who exhibit traits that are highly stereotypically associated with one sex 
group or the other are not more likely than other parents to have children who exhibit 
such strongly stereotyped behavior (Angrilli, 1960; Hetherington, 1965; Maccoby and 
Jacklin, 1974; Mussen &amp; Rutherford, 1963). In addition, when researchers have tried to 
specifically alter gender-related models (or reinforcements) that children receive, changes 
in behavior have been only temporary (Maccoby, 1992, pp. 1008, 1011; Stockard &amp; 
Johnson, 1992, pp. 163-167).

<p>As empirical research failed to provide strong support for social learning theory, scholars 
began to develop other explanations of socialization in general and gender socialization 
in particular. The most important approach has no doubt been cognitive developmental 
theory, which builds on the research of Jean Piaget and his finding that children gradu-
ally develop more complex ways of interacting with others and understanding the world 
around them. Lawrence Kohlberg extended Piaget's notions by applying them to gender 
socialization, suggesting that children's views of appropriate gender roles also change as 
they grow older, reflecting their changing cognitive development. Kohlberg and others 
working within this paradigm have documented an increasing flexibility and complexity 
of children's views of gender roles with age (Kohlberg, 1966; UlUan, 1976). According to 
this perspective, the fact that very young children have much more rigid, stereotyped 
views of appropriate behaviors for males and females than do older children or adults can 
be explained by the greater cognitive flexibility and capability for complex thought that 
develops with age. 
</p>
<p>Cognitive developmental theory can be seen as providing two important theoretical 
advances over social learning theory. First, it seriously incorporates an understanding of 
the active role of the child and the importance of cognitive processing and understanding 
in the socialization process. Second, it includes an understanding of developmental changes 
in the process of gender socialization and specifically describes how children's interpre-
tations and understandings of gender alter and change as their cognitive capabilities 
become more developed and complex. 
</p>
<p>Certain technical elements of cognitive developmental theory, however, have not 
withstood empirical test. Specifically, Kohlberg hypothesized that the child's active in-
volvement in and desire to develop gender-typed behaviors becomes most important once 
a child has developed a strong notion of gender constancy, the understanding that one is 
either a boy or a girl and that this categorization will not change. Research indicates that 
children acquire this gender constancy by about 6 years of age (e.g., Slaby &amp; Frey, 1975, 
cited by Luecke-Aleksa, Anderson, Collins, &amp; Schmitt, 1995). Interestingly enough, how-
ever, a number of gender differences&mdash;specifically differences in choices of toys and play-
mates&mdash;appear long before the age at which cognitive developmental theory would ex-
pect. Fairly consistently, by the age of 2 or 3, boys and girls choose to play with different 
toys and in different activities, prefer to play with like-sex playmates, and exhibit differ-
ences in aggressive behaviors (Huston, 1985, 1985, p. 11; Leinbach &amp; Fagot, 1986, p. 
665; Lobel &amp; Menashri, 1993; Martin, 1993; Stockard &amp; Johnson, 1992, p. 169). In 
recent years some scholars have turned to trying to understand these very early aspects of 
gender socialization. </p>

<p>4. GENDER SCHEMAS AND COGNITIVE LEARNING THEORIES 
</p>
<p>Recent approaches to understanding gender socialization have often incorporated the 
notion of schemas, cognitive structures or frameworks that people use to organize and 
process information to which they are exposed. Schemas provide an efficient way to orga-
nize new knowledge and information and help individuals maintain consistency and pre-
dictability in new situations. Gender schemas are cognitive schemas that are used to 
organize information on the basis of gender categories. Theorists who use this approach 
suggest that children develop increasingly more elaborate gender schemas as they de-
velop their gender identity and their understanding of gender roles. As children come 
across information or new situations that pertain to gender they tend to use their gender 
schemas as a guide for interpreting this information, a way to simplify information and 
decisions. 
</p>
<p>Carol Lynn Martin and Charles Halvorsen (1981, 1987) have suggested that there 
are two types of gender schemas based on an "in-group/out-group" model. Children cat-
egorize information based on whether it involves their own sex group (the in-group) or 
the other (the out-group) and then use this categorization to help choose toys and behav-
iors and decide whether to attend to new information. For instance, when faced with new 
toys or potential playmates, children use this gender schema to determine their actions 
(Bem, 1981; Markus, Crane, Bernstein, &amp; Saladi, 1982; Martin, 1993; Martin &amp; Halvorson, 
1981, 1987). Research indicates that rudimentary gender schema&mdash;the ability to discrimi-
nate males and females and link characteristics such as hair and clothing styles to these 
differences&mdash;can appear by one year of age (Fagot &amp; Leinbach, 1993; Leinbach &amp; Fagot, 
1993). 
</p>
<p>It is important to realize that gender schemas are both complex and multidimen-
sional. This has been demonstrated both through an older body of research in the tradi-
tion of "masculinity-femininity" tests (Constaninople, 1973; Lewis, 1968, pp. 69-71; 
Stockard &amp; Johnson, 1992, p. 153) and in newer studies of children's gender-typed be-
havior and personalities and developing gender schemas (Hort, Leinbach, &amp; Fagot, 1991; 
Sears, Rau, &amp; Alpert, 1965; Turner &amp; Gervai, 1995). One carefully designed study used 
longitudinal data collected on children beginning at the age of 18 months and continuing 
until the age of 4. At various times over this period different aspects of children's cogni-
tive understandings of gender (all of which are believed to be part of a gender schema) 
were assessed, including their ability to label correctly pictures of people as male or 
female, their knowledge of gender-typed activities and objects, their memory of gender-
typed stimuli, and the salience of gender in their assessments of stimuli. The researchers 
found that there was very little association between each of these cognitive aspects of 
gender and suggested that "children fit together the puzzle pieces of gender acquisition in 
a variety of loosely organized, idiosyncratic ways" (Hort et al., 1991, p. 206). 
</p>
<p>In short, studies of both children and adults suggest that gender schemas are very 
complex and multidimensional and that children acquire gender schemas in a variety of 
ways (see also Huston, 1983; Levy &amp; Fivush, 1993; Signorella, Bigler, &amp; Liben, 1993). 
Data are beginning to suggest that these various components of gender schema may in-
volve not just cognitive knowledge and stereotypes, but also affective and evaluative com-
ponents, and even metaphoric qualities, such as strength, danger, or gentleness (Fagot &amp; 
Leinbach, 1993, p. 220; see also Martin, 1993; Martin, Wood, &amp; Little, 1990). 
</p>
<p>The notion of gender schemas does not refute other theories of gender socialization. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>220 Jean Stockard 
</p>
<p>but can potentially help us understand more about the influence of reinforcement, model-
ing, and cognitive development. For instance, there is some evidence that children who 
learn to correctly apply gender labels earlier than other children have parents who en-
dorse more traditional attitudes toward women and also more often reinforce sex-typed 
play (Fagot &amp; Leinbach, 1989, 1993, p. 218; Fagot, Leinbach, &amp; O'Boyle, 1992). In 
addition, reinforcement may or may not change children's behavior depending upon their 
cognitive understandings and ways of processing information related to gender (Jacklin, 
1989, p. 130). The notion of gender schemas can also explain why children may or may 
not choose to model certain behaviors. When children (or adults) encounter models that 
are contrary to their gender schema, they may either not attend to those behaviors or try to 
interpret them in a way that corresponds to their existing gender schemas. Similarly, 
when children encounter models that they believe conform to their gender schema they 
may be especially likely to model those behaviors. Similarly, in support of ideas from the 
cognitive developmental view, children's choices of who and what gender roles to model 
appear to be related to their cognitive understandings of gender and what they believe is 
relevant to their own self definitions (Maccoby, 1992, p. 1011). 
</p>
<p>As noted previously, one of the earliest manifestations of gender typed behavior is 
the tendency for boys and girls to prefer different toys and playmates of the same sex. By 
the age of three, and in some situations even earlier, boys choose to play with other boys 
and girls choose to play with other girls. Both psychologists and sociologists have studied 
the culture of peer groups to understand more about why boys and girls prefer to associate 
with others of the same sex and how these associations influence gender socialization. 
</p>
<p>5. PEER GROUP INTERACTIONS 
AND THE CULTURE OF CHILDHOOD 
</p>
<p>When examining peer groups, scholars have found that gender can be seen in social 
</p>
<p>behaviors in ways that are not apparent when individuals and their traits and behaviors 
</p>
<p>are looked at alone. In particular, boys and girls tend to behave differently depending 
</p>
<p>upon whether they are with other boys, other girls, a mixed-sex peer group, or with 
</p>
<p>adults. In short, children, like all people, act in different ways, depending upon the situ-
</p>
<p>ation in which they find themselves. Many studies have demonstrated that children clearly 
</p>
<p>prefer to play with others of the same sex. These preferences appear spontaneously, when 
</p>
<p>children are not under pressure to make choices, and they are especially strong in situa-
</p>
<p>tions that are not monitored by adults. While situations can be structured in which boys 
</p>
<p>and girls interact comfortably together, the general preference for gender-segregated in-
</p>
<p>teractions appears very difficult to change. It appears as early as 3 years of age and in-
</p>
<p>creases in strength over time, maintaining a high level until at least age 11. The prefer-
</p>
<p>ences appear to be very difficult to change and do not seem to be related to individual 
</p>
<p>level measures of various aspects of masculinity and femininity. Children do maintain 
</p>
<p>cross-sex friendships, but they tend to occur within their homes or neighborhoods and are 
</p>
<p>often hidden from the larger peer group (Fagot, 1994; Maccoby, 1990, p. 514). 
</p>
<p>In general, children's activities may be seen as involving a "culture of childhood," a 
</p>
<p>pattern of games, activities, roles, norms, and even jokes and folklore that are passed on 
</p>
<p>from generation to generation of children with little, if any, active involvement by adults. 
</p>
<p>Most important for our purposes, this culture is highly gendered. Cultural elements, such 
</p>
<p>as norms, values, and the material elements such as toys and playthings, are strongly </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Socialization 221 
</p>
<p>gender typed. In addition, there are strong subcultures that are highly gender segregated. 
The gendered nature of the culture of childhood is markedly different in many ways from 
that of adults&mdash;with, as a cognitive developmental perspective would suggest, much more 
rigid distinctions between roles for males and females and more extensive and apparent 
sanctions for violating these roles (Maccoby, 1991a, p. 538; Powlishta, 1995). 
</p>
<p>In examining children's interactions, scholars have tried to determine what distin-
guishes the interactions of groups of boys and groups of girls and have found differences 
in both games and activities as well as interactional styles. Boys tend to play in larger 
groups, in rougher activities, and to take up more space when they play. Their interac-
tions tend to be focused more on their mutual interest in activities and more often tend to 
involve displays of dominance, with the use of interruptions, commands, threats, and 
boasts. Girls tend to form close, more intimate friendships with one or two other girls and 
are more likely to express agreements with others, allow others to have a turn in speak-
ing, and to acknowledge points made by others. Both boys and girls successfully influ-
ence others in their interactions; they simply tend to do so through different styles (Maccoby, 
1990, p. 516). 
</p>
<p>The developmental psychologist Eleanor Maccoby points to two factors that seem to 
underlie the development of gender segregated play groups in the preschool years. First, 
girls seem to find boys' more rough and tumble play styles and orientation toward compe-
tition and dominance aversive, and thus try to avoid it. Second, given their different 
interactive styles, girls find it difficult to influence boys, for their characteristic style of 
polite suggestion does not match the style of direct commands more often adopted by 
boys. A basic element of group process is the notion of exchange, or mutual influence. 
Maccoby hypothesizes that because boys and girls find it difficult to find interaction 
patterns that allow such mutual influence, they tend to avoid forming groups that include 
children of both sex groups (Maccoby, 1988, 1990, p. 515; see also Fabes, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Ethnographic studies of peer groups among children and adolescents have docu-
mented the nature of gender-segregated peer groups as children grow older. Extensive 
observations have revealed the importance of interactions with others of the same sex in 
helping children develop their gender identity and definitions of appropriate gender roles, 
as children actively discuss and develop definitions of masculinity and femininity. These 
discussions involve not just areas of toy choice or games, but also the nature of sexuality 
and sexual relationships (Eder, 1995; Fine, 1987; Holland &amp; Eisenhart, 1990; Jordan &amp; 
Cowan, 1995; Thorne, 1993; Voss, 1997). 
</p>
<p>It is again important to note that other theories used to understand gender socializa-
tion can be used to account for processes within peer groups. Observations of peer groups 
indicate that children clearly reinforce each other for behaviors that are deemed either 
appropriate or inappropriate in terms of gender (Fagot, 1994). Children also tend to 
model other children as they try to develop behaviors that they believe are appropriate. 
Cognitive processes, which are linked to developmental changes, are clearly involved as 
children decide whether or not to enter a play group and the extent to which gender 
segregation should be maintained. Although the processes involved in gender socializa-
tion within peer groups are not yet fully understood, most scholars in this area believe 
that diverse theoretical and methodological approaches will be needed to develop a full 
understanding (Maccoby, 1994; Martin, 1994; Serbin, Moller, Gulko, Powlishta, &amp; 
Colburne, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Research is also needed to understand fully the long-term implications of childhood 
gender segregation for gender segregation and inequalities in adult life. Boys' peer groups </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>222 Jean Stockard 
</p>
<p>seem far less amenable to direction and supervision by adults than do girls' peer groups, 
leading researchers to speculate about connections between peer group interactions and 
boys' later difficulties in school, such as lower grades and greater behavior problems 
(e.g., Fagot, 1994, pp. 62-63; Jordan &amp; Cowan, 1995). Others have noted possible diffi-
culties in children developing competencies, such as interpersonal interaction styles, that 
are more typical of the other sex, thus enabling more effective cross-sex interaction (e.g., 
Leaper, 1994). Still others have speculated about the relationship between childhood gen-
der segregation and adult patterns of interaction, both within the family and within the 
world of work (e.g., Maccoby, 1991b, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Although both boys and girls prefer interactions in gender-segregated groups, data 
indicate that boys are far more concerned with gender segregation than are girls. Girls 
receive less punishment from their peers for cross-sex behaviors than do boys. In addition 
girls are far more likely to interact with adults than are boys, while boys are resistant to 
interactions with either girls or adults (Fagot, 1994, p. 60; Maccoby, 1990, p. 516; 1994, 
p. 88). While girls' aversion to boys' interactive and play styles can explain why girls 
tend to avoid boys, it cannot as easily explain why boys tend to avoid girls. Psychoana-
lytic theory directly addresses this issue. 
</p>
<p>6. PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY 
</p>
<p>Psychoanalysis was founded by Sigmund Freud in the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries. From the very early years of the discipline Freud and his students and followers 
debated the nature of gender socialization&mdash;how childhood experiences influence boys' 
and girls' ideas about themselves, their gender, and sexuality. Two general perspectives 
developed. One, based on Freud's own writing, emphasized the centrality of the Oedipus 
complex and its resolution to differences in male and female development. According to 
Freud, girls, unlike boys, could never fully resolve the Oedipus complex and were fated to 
have a weaker superego, Freud's term for the conscience. Even in Freud's lifetime this 
view was sharply attacked and many of Freud's students developed an alternative per-
spective, which has come to be one that most contemporary psychoanalysts, based on 
their clinical experience, accept today. 
</p>
<p>Writers in this second perspective emphasize the importance of the fact that the 
mother is the first person to whom all children, both boys and girls, relate. During their 
early years children develop strong relationships with their mother (or other female care-
taker). Because this very strong early tie is almost always with a woman, children's first 
identification is feminine, rather than masculine. As children become older and more 
independent they need to lessen the very strong ties that they had with the mother figure 
during infancy. They also learn what it means to be a male or a female. For a girl, this is 
relatively easy because the mother was the first person with whom she identified. How-
ever, psychoanalytic theorists suggest, achieving gender identity is harder for a boy be-
cause in the process he must reject his first identity as feminine. In addition, because 
fathers and other men often are not such a central part of young boys' lives as are mothers 
and other women, it may be hard to develop a strong idea of just what masculinity in-
volves. 
</p>
<p>Because the boy knows most intimately what is feminine, he comes to define mascu-
linity as being "not-feminine." In his behaviors and relationships with others he devalues 
what is feminine and denies his attachment to the feminine world. To use psychoanalytic </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender Socialization 223 
</p>
<p>terms, he represses the feminine identification developed in his early relationship with 
the mother. As a result, boys' gender identity tends to be somewhat more tenuous than 
girls' gender identity (see especially Chodorow, 1974, 1978, 1989; Deutsch, 1944-1945; 
Dinnerstein, 1976; Fairbairn, 1952; Homey, 1967a, b; Klein, 1960; Mead, 1949). 
</p>
<p>The sociologist Talcott Parsons (1955, 1970) suggested that the process that psycho-
analytic theorists describe as "identification" could actually be seen as learning to play a 
social role with another person in complementary, reciprocal role interactions. In these 
terms, children first learn to play the role of child, which is complementary to the role of 
mother. This role is not gender typed, as both boy and girl infants learn to feel loved and 
nurtured as well as to nurture others. As children grow older, their role relationships 
expand and they gradually develop more independence, loosening this first tie with the 
mother. At the same time, they become more aware of their identity as a boy or a girl and 
begin to learn roles associated with this gender identity. Miriam Johnson has noted the 
special role of the father in helping both boys and girls develop these understandings, as 
the father tends to become more involved with children as they become older and more 
aware of gender differences. (See Johnson, 1988; Lerman, 1986; Stockard &amp; Johnson, 
1979, 1992 for a complete discussion of these traditions.) 
</p>
<p>Both the traditional psychoanalytic view and the more sociological role-oriented 
version of this perspective suggest that the motives underlying boys' strong preferences 
for gender-segregated play groups and their avoidance of female-typed activities can be 
traced to these early experiences in the family and, especially, the virtually universal 
early relationship between infants and a mother or other female caretaker. Building on 
this premise, these theorists suggest that when fathers are more involved in early child 
rearing boys would be less likely to exhibit signs of "compulsive masculinity" and, in 
adulthood, would be less likely to promote strong patterns of gender stratification (e.g., 
Chodorow, 1974, 1978, 1989; Johnson, 1988). Support for these speculations comes from 
clinical evidence from the psychoanalytic tradition, ethnographic field studies of adults, 
and analyses of cross-cultural data on societies in which fathers take a wide range of 
different roles in child rearing (e.g., Coltrane, 1988, 1992; WilUams, 1989). 
</p>
<p>7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
</p>
<p>Understandings of gender socialization have advanced a great deal over the last few de-
</p>
<p>cades. Contemporary theories emphasize the importance of the child's role in developing 
</p>
<p>a gender identity and understanding of gender roles. Central to these approaches are 
</p>
<p>notions of changing cognitive awareness and understandings of the world, the develop-
</p>
<p>ment of cognitive schemas, and interactions in peer groups. Psychoanalytic theory can 
</p>
<p>help fill in gaps left by other approaches by explaining motives underlying boys' rela-
</p>
<p>tively intense support of gender-segregated activities. It also describes the central role of 
</p>
<p>family relationships in the development of gender identity. 
</p>
<p>Contemporary understandings of gender socialization also highlight the ways in 
</p>
<p>which gender development is complex and multidimensional. This complexity suggests 
</p>
<p>that we would be well served by both theory and research that attempt to understand the 
</p>
<p>common ground and linkages between the various theoretical perspectives and research 
</p>
<p>traditions used in this field. Researchers in the cognitive tradition have often drawn on 
</p>
<p>insights of social learning theorists. Less common has been work that attempts to inte-
</p>
<p>grate psychoanalytic theory, understandings from biology, and psychological and socio-</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>224 Jean Stockard 
</p>
<p>logical theories. Some preliminary work indicates that such efforts could be fruitful (e.g., 
Fast, 1984, 1993; Schore, 1994), but clearly, much more remains to be done. In addition, 
the majority of contemporary research and theorizing has focused on the United States 
and Western Europe (but see Berndt, Cheung, Lau, Kit-Tai Hau, &amp; Lew, 1993 and Turner 
and Gervai, 1995 for exceptions) with surprisingly little systematic comparisons across 
racial-ethnic and social class groups even there. Much more extensive comparative and 
cross-cultural work is clearly needed. 
</p>
<p>Finally, much of the writing that links gender socialization to gender stratification 
in the adult world (with the notable exception of the psychoanalytic tradition) is highly 
speculative. In the 1970s sociologists tended to shift their framework of analysis from 
socialization to a broader view of the lifecourse (see Elder, 1994, p. 8). Yet, there has been 
very little research that provides the lifecourse perspective to gender socialization and 
encompasses the span from early childhood to adult life. If analyses of gender socializa-
tion are to ultimately help us develop more gender equitable societies such analyses will 
need to become much more common.

<p>Gender and Social Roles 
</p>
<p>HELENA ZNANIECKA LOPATA 
</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>I begin by presenting and stressing my definition of social role, because it varies from one 
still being used by many sociologists, which limits the social role to a set of expectations 
and focuses only on the social person holding the role title. This does not make sense for 
two reasons. First, social life could not exist if everyone merely expected behavior and 
interaction; complex subidentifiers are needed to determine what actually occurs. In their 
major book on role theory Biddle and Thomas (1966) do not make that mistake; they 
define social role behaviorally. However, even their definition of an individual role refers 
to "all behavior of an individual" (p. 30) in terms of a "person-behavior matrix" (p. 45). 
This is simply too broad for analyses of specific roles, and it retains the second problem&mdash; 
a focus on only one individual. In real life no social role can exist without a social circle 
toward whom the behavior of the social person is directed and from whom corresponding 
action is received, the combination forming sets of social relationships. Even when using 
the analogy to a role in a play, as do Biddle and Thomas (1966), one must be cognizant of 
the fact that a theatrical role involves a circle of other actors, as well as the writer of the 
script, producers, audience, and a large group of workers building the set, advertising the 
play, and so forth. 
</p>
<p>I find a symbolic interactionist modification of Znaniecki's concept of social role 
most satisfactory for analysis of any particular social role or as a foundation for related 
concepts, such as role cluster, role strain, or role conflict. Thus, I am using the following 
definition in this chapter: 
</p>
<p>I wish to thank Janet Chafetz and Judith Wittner for help in idea expression and format.

</p>
<p>A Social Role is a set of patterned, mutually interdependent, social relations between a social person 
</p>
<p>and a social circle involving negotiated duties and obligations, rights and privileges. (Lopata, 1994b, 
</p>
<p>p. 4; see also 1966, 1969, 1971, 1991b; Znaniecki, 1965) 
</p>
<p>This definition shifts the focus from the person to the set of relations necessary for the 
social role to be carried forth. "The social person is that 'package' of characteristics with 
which an individual enters a specific role" (Lopata, 1994, p. 4). These are assumed to be 
necessary for the performance of the role-related duties and the receipt of the role-related 
rights. For example, to enter the role of mother in American society a woman must give 
birth, adopt, or in some other way acquire a child, whom she declares to society she will 
mother. Official recognition of motherhood is legally established. Generally speaking, a 
woman entering the role of mother must have the physical and mental characteristics 
that ensure care of the child in ways approved of by society. She must be able to bring 
together, if it is not provided for her, a whole social circle with whom to rear the child. 
The mother must also have the ability to socialize the child so that she or he can fit into 
societal life. Special consideration is given to mothers who do not see, hear, speak, or 
have the physical ability needed to carry, feed, and protect the child, but society gives 
itself the right to take the child away if it considers the care to be inadequate or if the 
child is endangered. 
</p>
<p>In other words, the society, community, and any preexisting social circle have the 
right to determine the necessary qualifications of a social person entering the role of 
mother, physician, plumber, or any other role over which these groups have jurisdictions. 
A person wishing to "make" or create a social role must pull together a circle of members 
willing to cooperate with her or him to meet the agreed upon purpose (Lopata, 1991b; 
Turner, 1962). Various tests have been created to establish whether an individual has the 
characteristics of the social person or social circle member of a specific social role. 
</p>
<p>The social circle consists of all those persons and other social units to whom the 
person at the center of the social role has duties and obligations and from whom she or he 
receives the rights needed to perform these duties. All these are negotiated with more or 
less freedom on either side and can vary considerably by setting, the society, community, 
and specific role. The social circle usually contains beneficiaries, such as "clients," stu-
dents, or children, toward whom major obligations are directed, and assistants, colleagues, 
persons in similar roles, and suppliers. A role requires at least the person and two others, 
the beneficiary and assistant or supplier of resources. By this definition, a dyad is a social 
relationship but it takes at least three persons to create a social role (Znaniecki, 1965). 
</p>
<p>Circle members have obligations and rights not only in relation to the social person, 
but often to each other as well. Thus, this concept of social circle avoids some of the 
problems entailed in Merton's (1957a, 1957b) concept of role set, in that it recognizes 
that circle members may have relations with each other based on the central role. For 
example, although some patients of a physician may not know each other and never 
interact, each relates not only to the physician, but also to her or his receptionist, nurse, 
and those patients who are in the waiting room together. The nurses relate with all these 
in their contribution to the doctor's role. 
</p>
<p>The reason people can enter social roles, as social person or circle members, is due 
to cultural models that define, more or less specifically, what qualifications all partici-
pants should possess, and the rights and duties on all sides. This view of social roles 
makes evident the possibility of role strain when different segments of the social circle 
make simultaneous demands, all considering their needs to be primary in importance 
(see Goode, 1960). Role overload, conflicting demands from different segments of the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Social Roles 231 
</p>
<p>circle or from the same segment, can be prevented only if the social person has the power 
to establish, or can negotiate, priorities. One method of decreasing demands is by simplify-
ing the social circle, although that solution has its own problems. Major sources of role 
strain result from the failure of the circle to provide adequate resources for approved 
action in the role. Finally, person-role strain can develop if the person does not have 
adequate qualifications and personal resources to meet the demands of a role or if such 
demands run contrary to her or his value system or personal preferences. 
</p>
<p>All persons are involved in more than one role, even if it is only as the social person 
of one and a circle member of another. Role clusters can contain roles within the same 
institution, such as the family, or in several different institutions, such as the family and 
occupation. The former role cluster can be identified as flat, regardless of the richness of 
multiple roles within it, the latter as multidimensional. Conflicts among roles are fre-
quent, as I shall examine in relation to gender. They arise from too many or conflicting 
demands made on an individual by people in different roles, or from the lack of resources, 
such as time or money, with which to balance such demands. One way an individual may 
avoid some conflict is by withdrawing from a role. Organizations may also try to prevent 
role conflict, as in the case of the refusal in recent centuries of the Catholic Church to 
allow its priests to marry and have families. 
</p>
<p>Although cultures contain models of major social roles, such as mother or father, 
each role is carried forth by a social person in negotiated relations with circle members. 
This complexity results in relational problems, as each person entering a role may have 
very different perceptions of its obligations and rights. An employer may wish an em-
ployee to bring her or his own clothing, while the employee may assume that uniforms 
are provided. The matter of cost involved in these two arrangements may be a source of 
serious irritation. The cultural model may assume the presence of a specific circle mem-
ber, such as a father in the case of the role of mother, while many American mothers must 
parent without a father. The title "doctor" is used by both M.D.s and Ph.D.s, but members 
of the society may assume it refers only to physicians (and, in not too distant a past, white 
male physicians). The title of the role and of the central person serves as a significant 
symbol for the organization of behavior by people wishing to interact with her or him. 
Some roles are rigidly defined, with little flexibility, as in the military. Some settings in a 
single society may treat same-gender partnerships the same way as traditional marriages, 
whereas others may forbid and even punish such relationships. The more complex the 
society in its composition and subcultures, the more variation there is on any social role, 
regardless of any assumed homogeneity. Yet, people socialized into certain symbols for 
social roles, such as titles, tend to take for granted an entire set of assumptions, providing 
constant opportunity for conflict, especially in rapidly changing settings. 
</p>
<p>I have one final comment on role theory. According to these definitions, there are no 
gender or race roles, only pervasive identities of social persons and circle members that 
enter, more or less significantly, into social roles. It is possible, and some thinkers believe 
this to be the case, that there are social roles of woman and man in modern society whose 
function is to distinguish between the genders in all social relationships. Caste roles were 
distinctly of such nature. However, Barrie Thome and I (1978; see also Stacey &amp; Thome, 
1985) have concluded that such a conceptualization of gender is meaningless, especially 
since it aggregates all men and all women with no internal differentiation within each 
category. It thus assumes that all men relate to all women in the same way, that is, accord-
ing to the rules of such sex or gender roles. It appears to be more logical and realistic to 
visualize the situation in terms of the following processes: Sexual identification at birth, </p>
<p/>

<p>232 Helena Znaniecka Lopata 
</p>
<p>or at a time of sexual change, seems universal. This becomes a gender identification and 
identity into which people are socialized and remain involved as they enter different 
social relations and roles throughout the life course. This pervasive identity becomes an 
important characteristic in some roles, (e.g., mother or father), but less so in other roles 
(e.g., physician or store clerk). It enters more in relationship with some members of the 
same or the other gender, less so in other interactions. It is part of the "package" that we 
carry with us in our social interactions, as are racial, religious, and ethnic identities, but 
is more important than, for instance, red hair before voluntary hair color changes, or 
extremes in height.

<p>I now turn to an analysis of gendered roles, mainly in the complex American society, 
using the above definition of social role and related concepts. This will be an historical 
view of the changing cultural models in family and community social roles of men and 
women, recognizing that none of these exist except in the relation between a social per-
son and a social circle. The subject is complex, and many social scientists have worked 
hard at making sense of it in terms of its social class, racial, and ethnic variations. The 
shortage of space for this analysis makes some omissions unavoidable. 
</p>
<p>Major problems with understanding social roles in this society are the rapidity of 
social change and the enormity of social diversity. Various aspects of the cultural models 
of major roles are constantly changing, first as deviations from prior ones, then as more 
accepted guidelines, and finally as old models to be gradually replaced. An example of 
this are same-gender variations on sexual partnership and parenthood roles. As Gusfield 
(1967) pointed out many years ago, social change cannot be conceptualized bipolarly, as 
into traditionalism and modernity. Various aspects of social roles can change at different 
rates. A perfect example of such variations in the rate of social change is in the case of 
family roles. 
</p>
<p>In brief, contemporary family rples have been deeply influenced by past changes in 
the economic structures of most societies, especially American. The processes of industri-
alization and urbanization, of the organization of most work into jobs within economi-
cally motivated organizations, and of the development of nation-states and of a series of 
accompanying cultural changes split the conceptualized world in many ways, including 
into two spheres, private and public (Lopata, 1993a, 1994b). Much of the work pulled 
into occupational roles became defined as masculine, with some clearly gendered excep-
tions (e.g., nursing and teaching). The private sphere became the province of the home 
and family, extended to those aspects of community life that were defined as associated 
with these. This province became the domain of women, whose role cluster was recon-
structed from that of member of a cooperating family integrated with the community in 
all institutions, to that of homemaker, wife, and mother in a privatized home. In the 
meantime, the men's sphere was separated from this territory and simultaneously ex-
panded to all institutions of public life: economic, political, religious, and higher educa-
tional. The enormous consequences of this division are still visible in the images of the 
ideal man and woman and in the relations between the genders. The images had to be recon-
structed to fit this two-sphere world, in spite of the fact that neither gender could possibly 
exist in only one sphere. Women had to become defined and socialized into motherly, 
caregiving, empathetic, "expressive," and cooperative persons, while men became de-</p>

<p>fined and socialized as rational, efficient, strong, and competitive, as summarized by 
Parsons (1943/1954), who found such an arrangement systemically functional (see Chafetz, 
this volume). In addition, the two-sphere world visualized interaction between men and 
women as highly restricted, since it assumed that all they had in common was sex.' 
</p>
<p>Serious attempts have been made by cultural, religious, educational, and other lead-
ers to ensure that such a dichotomized world is supported in every possible way. Such an 
ideal-typical world construct was never completely possible, however, and it has become 
increasingly apparent that it is "dysfunctional" to the system, not to mention to the lives 
of both men and women. Various social movements have drawn the society's and its 
individual members' attention to the problems of such a world. In social role terms, the 
attempt to create a two-sphere world and related gendered personalities resulted in tre-
mendous problems for most social roles because it flattened the lifespace of social persons 
and changed the composition and characteristics of members of their social circles. This 
is illustrated by strains in the social roles of wife and husband, mother and father, and 
those in organized public life. 
</p>
<p>2.1. Wife and Husband Roles 
</p>
<p>The role of wife in pre- or even early-industrial times, especially in patriarchal, patrilin-
eal, and patrilocal societies, involved the woman in cooperation with not only her hus-
band, but also his family of orientation and often extended family, as well as his village 
(Thomas &amp; Znaniecki, 1918-1920). It did not include her family of birth, since by mar-
riage she joined the husband's family, often at a considerable distance from her own. Her 
position as a wife depended mainly upon the husband's position in his family, although 
her personal characteristics and her contributions to that family economically, socially, and in 
terms of the status she brought with her or developed were usually acknowledged. Her duties 
to her husband were often defined and supervised by her in-laws (Lopata, 1999). His family, 
in turn, granted her rights making possible the performance of these duties. For example, 
according to anthropologist Paul Bohannan (1963), men universally acquired certain 
rights over their wives upon marriage, including the right to share a domicile, sexual 
access, "m genetricem rights" of filiation of the children to the husband's line, and economic 
rights of various strength.^ In return, the wife gained the right to a shared domicile; the 
results of sexual access (usually meaning children), shared responsibility over, and care 
of, the children; and economic cooperation and interdependent support. What happened 
to the role of wife after the death of the husband depended upon the status she held in the 
family and community and the status of widows. Family systems concerned with biologi-
cal fatherhood usually forbade the widow to remarry, or even have sexual relations out-
side of the family line. They sometimes ensured that she continued having children and 
that these remained with the family through a levirate system, by which a male agnate of 
the deceased continued to impregnate her, although the resulting children were consid-
ered the offspring of the deceased (Bohannan, 1963; see also Lopata, 1987a, 1987b).' 
</p>
<p>' This is evident in the strong conservative objection to men and women serving alongside in the military (see 
</p>
<p>Lopata, 1992). 
</p>
<p>^ Obviously, Bohannan based this conclusion on studies of patriarchal families. 
</p>
<p>' Numerous studies of widowhood convinced me that the situation of widows is highly indicative of the role of wife 
</p>
<p>and of the situation of women in a society and its communities (see Lopata, 1996). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>234 Helena Znaniecka Lopata 
</p>
<p>In heavily patriarchal societies the role of the husband was also embedded in his 
other family roles. Family members helped him provide the rights and resources for his 
wife in her role and received rights from her because she was his wife. Thus, both marital 
roles were submerged in the intertwining of complex, multiple family roles. In such fam-
ily systems a widower could remarry without any problems, since the lineage of the wife 
did not count and since the family needed the work done by a wife. 
</p>
<p>The gradual processes of expansion of societal complexity decreased considerably 
the power of the patriarchal line over its youths to the extent that they could obtain an 
education and occupational preparation away from home, take a job, marry, and even 
move a distance away. This changed both marital roles by decreasing obligations to the 
male's family. For example, the wife could now set up her own household and run it with 
much less interference from the husband's family. The husband gradually lost the respon-
sibility for his aged or widowed parents, so that he could concentrate upon his family of 
procreation. This, however, created problems for his family of orientation, which had 
lived in the anticipation of support from sons in old age. It did benefit the new unit. Such 
a shift has been documented, for example, in the recent case of Turkish sons who emi-
grated to Germany. The widowed mothers left behind gradually received fewer economic 
benefits, as the sons shifted their allegiance with Westernization (Heisel, 1987). 
</p>
<p>While the in-law segment of the wife's social circle diminished in importance in 
terms of her duties toward it, this also diminished the supports she had received from it in 
her role of wife, so that the main responsibility for the "care" of the husband fell on her 
shoulders with the help of whomever she could pull into the circle. The relative absence, 
or at least infrequency of contact, with the male line removed a possible source of abuse 
from that circle, but at the same time it also removed a possible source of protection from 
abuse from the husband, especially in the weakening of community support as the de-
mand for personal privacy increased. The alleged right of relational partners to safety 
was often neglected; in fact, wife abuse sometimes received community approval, espe-
cially in subcultures characterized by strong patriarchal power. 
</p>
<p>Thus, the wife's duties toward the husband, along with the composition of her circle, 
changed dramatically as his job became increasingly important in economically focused 
societies. Her social circle often included his work associates toward whom she had defi-
nite duties of entertainment, communication, and other forms of interaction. According 
to Papanek (1973, 1979), the wife became the behind-the-scenes partner in a "two-person 
single career" in which she performed numerous instrumental and expressive duties that 
enabled her husband to succeed in his job, of which he was the official center. Papanek 
(1973, 1979), Finch (1983), Daniels (1988), Lopata (1971, 1993a, 1994b) and many 
other social scientists outlined these duties as including "stroking," to decrease the stress 
caused by his other relationships on the job; keeping all problems of the home and family 
from disturbing him, which means handling them herself; fulfilling her role as home-
maker or manager of the home with little help from the househusband; child-rearing; and 
meeting the obligations of both parents to prevent his career from being interrupted."* 
Papanek (1979) pointed to the importance of status-maintaining work in their residential 
and his occupational communities and with the employing organization. The required 
</p>
<p>&bull;* Interestingly enough, there is no equivalent role for a man that matches the "housewife" or more recently "home-
</p>
<p>maker" role of a woman. The label "househusband" usually refers to a husband who stays home to care for the 
</p>
<p>children. It usually means that there is a wife and that she is the "breadwinner." I have not seen this concept applied 
</p>
<p>to single-parent fathers, who do not automatically become homemakers. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Social Roles 235 
</p>
<p>behavior, including proper self-demeanor as well as that of properly educated and mar-
ried offspring, necessitated refraining from involvement in competing social roles, such 
as employment. Ostrander (1984) and Daniels (1988) found that status work varied by 
whether the status of the family, reflected in the status of the husband, simply needed 
maintenance, or was also oriented toward upward mobility. The whole life of the wife 
became dependent upon the husband's job, its location, rhythm, costs, and benefits. The 
situation of Hillary Clinton is illuminating. Although she is known to be a highly suc-
cessful and intelligent career woman, Americans see her not as a partner in the presi-
dency, but only as the rather devalued "First Lady," who should model herself on the way 
prior "First Ladies" behaved. She was totally rebuked as the sponsor of a major presiden-
tial initiative.' Thus, her role is seen in two-person, single career terms. 
</p>
<p>During the height of the two-person career trend, which reached its peak in the post-
World War II decades, the main function of the husband was that of being a "good pro-
vider" (Bernard, 1983), as evidenced by the home and family he supported financially. 
Being a good provider meant that his wife did not "need" to be employed, and that all her 
economic contributions to his and the rest of the family's welfare were devalued as being 
those of "only a housewife." When I (Lopata, 1971) asked full-time homemakers and 
employed suburbanites and urbanites in the 1950s and 1960s what were the most impor-
tant roles of men, they most frequently listed "breadwinner," and most saw their own 
main, almost exclusive, roles as care of the family and motherhood. Roles outside of the 
family were placed last on a list of possible roles of women. Only a few of the respon-
dents, married to business executive or professional men, felt that they had some influ-
ence on their husband' careers, thus underevaluating their contributions. Betty Friedan 
(1963) labeled this whole ideology The Feminine Mystique and started a revolutionary 
reconstruction of reality and roles. 
</p>
<p>Actually, when The Feminine Mystique was published, the behavior of women was 
already changing, although not yet in ideology and self-concepts, as wives began, or 
continued, moving into the occupational world. In the years of my Occupation: House-
wife (1971) studies, a woman's justification for employment was that her paycheck would 
be used for "special projects" that did not detract from the husband's good provider role. 
Bird (1979) studied ways in which marital couples tried to incorporate the wife's pay-
check, usually as "pin money" too insignificant to threaten the breadwinner. Although 
Bernard (1983) recorded the "fall" of the good provider role in the early 1980s, the wife's 
paycheck remains a problem in many families, especially if it is larger than that of her 
husband. 
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the occupational sphere, organized around the assumptions and 
expectations of the two-person career in which the major person is the man, has not 
changed much even to this day, with some exceptions on the part of some organizations 
that became aware of the economic advantages of flexibility in the scheduling of work. 
Coser (1974) called much of the occupational world "greedy" institutions. Most employ-
ing organizations still make the same demands of time, energy, and responsibility of their 
workers, and if they do provide, for example, paternity leaves, few male employees actu-
ally take advantage of them. The dramatic movement of wives and mothers into the labor 
</p>
<p>' She certainly has an enormous social circle in her role of wife with whose members she must interact at various 
</p>
<p>levels. She is doing so differently than from the wives of most other presidents, accentuating my point concerning 
</p>
<p>the complexity of the society and variations in the ways role models are negotiated and modified by the contact and 
</p>
<p>characteristics of social persons and social circles. </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>force has not been accompanied by major changes in occupational and related institutions 
or in the work patterns of husbands. This places a heavy burden on the wife as she struggles 
to continue meeting some of the traditional obligations to her career-minded husband in 
spite of the demands of her own often "greedy" occupation and "greedy" family (Coser, 
1974; Coser &amp; Coser, 1974). Hochschild (1989) found wives spending considerably more 
time than husbands in maintaining their home, even in the absence of children, but espe-
cially in their presence. She labeled the work employed women do, in their roles of wife, 
mother, and homemaker The Second Shift. Attempts to negotiate a decrease of obliga-
tions and an increase of rights from circle members, especially husbands, have proven 
difficult in the presence of traditional role models and in the absence of anyone in their 
social circle in the role of wife who is willing to take over some of their duties. Numerous 
studies indicate that role conflict on the part of women is not solved in any significant way by 
a shift of men's priorities. A partial exception to women's second shift occurs in cases in 
which the wife and husband start out together focused on the public sphere. Even then, the 
birth of children tends to unbalance whatever symmetry of work and household responsibility 
the couple developed before, or during, marriage. In contrast, Blumstein and Schwartz (1983) 
found lesbian and gay partnerships less concerned about the division of work, money, 
sexuality, and emotional support than married or cohabiting heterosexual couples. 
</p>
<p>2.2. Mother and Father Roles 
</p>
<p>British Common Law, which became the foundation of the American legal system, gave 
"absolute right to the custody of their minor children to the father" (Lindgren &amp; Taub, 
1988; see Lopata, 1994b, p. 65). The legal system has shifted to such an extent that the 
mother is now seen as the main parent, responsible not only for what she does, but also 
for what the father does and for the behavior of the children, seen as a result of such 
parenting. In the event of divorce, it is mainly the mother who is now given custody. The 
modern stress on the economic institution released the man from many family obliga-
tions, first to his family of orientation and then even to his family of procreation (as long 
as he supported this unit economically) so that he could devote all his time, energy, and 
emotion to competition on the job and to his career. This trend, in conjunction with the 
removal of the husband's family from control over the role of wife, has had repercussions 
upon other roles in the family institution, especially those of mother and of father. The 
circle of the mother no longer contains an important segment of grandparents, aunts and 
uncles, and relatives by marriage. On the other hand, the woman's birth family has been 
able to increase its participation in her role of mother, since she no longer has to leave it 
upon marriage and no longer has major obligations to her in-laws. Chodorow's (1978) 
and Sokoloff's (1980) influential thesis of the inevitable bond between mother and daughter 
ignores much of human history. It also ignores some contemporary societies in which the 
birth of a daughter is not welcome because she will have to be fed and cared for until an 
age in which she could be helpful, and then she will cost the family an expensive dowry 
and be gone. She cannot even perform the duties of ancestor worship. Thus, she is a 
burden, rather than a joy, as numerous accounts of the lot of girls in India (Gurjal, 1987), 
China (Barnes, 1987); see also Lopata, 1987a, 1996), and other countries have repeatedly 
stressed. Even recently, human rights commissions reports in the mass media document 
that girl children have been allowed to die or were even sold as concubines or wives, as 
beggars, or prostitutes (de Mause, 1974). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Social Roles 237 
</p>
<p>The transformation of the family system has changed the relationship of the mother 
to her own parents, especially to her mother, who has now entered the social circle of her 
daughter's role of mother (Lopata, 1991b). A young woman's mother can maintain con-
tact with her daughter over the lifecourse, and the bond becomes even closer as the daughter 
becomes a mother herself (Fischer, 1986). Mothers-in-law generally have few rights and 
provide minimal support (Lopata, 1979). Maternal assistance is today important, in the 
relative absence of in-laws, the complete absence of servants in all but wealthy families, 
and of frequent absence of fathers in daily life (Hochschild, 1989). However, the mother's 
contribution to her daughter's role as mother rarely includes protection against harm to 
her or her family, usually from the father or his substitute, because of the older woman's 
lack of power. 
</p>
<p>An even more recent change in the role of young mother has been the decrease of the 
contributions of even her mother to her social circle, because women old enough to be 
grandmothers are likely to be in the labor force, with little time to actively help with the 
children. In addition, many of the widows I (Lopata, 1973, 1979) studied in the Chicago 
area are unwilling to become full-time participants in their daughters' roles of mothers, 
having already worked in that role themselves. Moreover, many have become economi-
cally self sufficient, and they do not have to exchange childcare work for their grown 
children for housing and maintenance. Those who wish and need to can do childcare for 
pay, controlling the conditions better than if working for their own families. Societal 
assistants and suppliers have not yet caught up with the need to help mothers in the care 
of the children. Individualism and an ideology of concern with one's own children alone 
have permeated American culture (see Grubb &amp; Lazerson, 1982). Yet, there is an inter-
esting social class difference in attitudes. Americans continue to believe that middle- and 
upper-class women should stay home to care for their homes, but insist that poor women 
take jobs away from their home. In all of the discussion of "selfish mothers" or "welfare 
mothers" there is little acknowledgement that there are more people than just mothers 
who need children and future generations of contributive adults. The feeling that fathers 
have responsibilities that are not met has not been strong enough to push societal action 
toward solutions of their parental problems. Throughout the mass media and even the 
social science literature, people other than the mother, including the father, are seen as 
merely "helping;" they are not defined as responsible members of parenting circles. There 
is a great deal of speculation as to when the society and its communities and organiza-
tions will seriously understand that "It takes a whole village to raise a child." 
</p>
<p>As a result of changes in parental roles, the rights of parents and the obligations of 
children have been strongly modified. In past centuries, and even today despite the redefini-
tion of morality in the Western world, children have been valued mainly as contributors 
to the economic subsistence of the family (Sommerville, 1982). They were sent to work 
early on family lands or businesses, to factories, or to other people's homes as servants, 
with the obligation to turn over to the parents the products, profits, or wages from their 
labor. At one time, parents even took out insurance on their children in case they died, 
depriving the families of their labor. It is only recently that the image of children changed 
from them as expendable or economically productive to being "priceless" (Zelizer, 1987) 
members of families in the recent "century of the child" (Ehrenreich &amp; English, 1979). 
Thus, the current view of children's obligations to their mothers is mostly that they "turn 
out OK," preferably bringing their mothers pride as they receive honors, a good mar-
riage, and grandchildren for occasional visits. Fathers generally have the same expecta-
tions, besides possibly being "pals" with their sons and walking down the aisle with the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>238 Helena Znaniecka Lopata 
</p>
<p>daughters at their wedding. Newer generations of fathers have begun to take an active, if 
still asymmetrical, part in parenting (Hochschild, 1989), although mothers still see them-
selves and are seen by the fathers as the ones most responsible for the children. 
</p>
<p>3. RACL4L, ETHNIC, AND CLASS INTERTWINING IN FAMILY ROLES 
</p>
<p>Racial, ethnic, religious, and social class variations exist in the roles of wife and hus-
band, mother and father, but are complicated by the intertwining of these aspects and by 
change over time. Most American families, with a few exceptions such as among some 
native American tribes, have a patriarchal background in which marital and parental 
roles were clearly defined as to the characteristics of the social person and of the circle, as 
well as to the duties and rights of each role. Obedience by the wife to her husband and by 
children to parents was officially approved and strictly enforced by those in power, en-
couraged by Puritans and by other family systems. Numerous studies (de Mause, 1974; 
Pleck, 1983) have documented both the abuse that followed and the various means by 
which the dominated family members attempted to empower themselves. Rules were most 
strictly followed by the lower-working-class and by the status protecting upper-class, but 
the flavor of the relationships varied considerably and has changed considerably in recent 
times. 
</p>
<p>3.1. The Poor and the Working Class 
</p>
<p>Stack (1975), Liebow (1967), and others found fathers among the poor, sometimes called 
the underclass, less involved in parenting in the culturally defined manner than the "ideal-
typical" image of the father in the middle and upper classes, primarily for socioeconomic 
reasons. The social circle of the role of mother may include men other than the biological 
father; her own family of orientation, especially mother and grandmother; friends; and 
neighbors. Fictive relatives appear in several roles, assisting mothers, intervening in marital 
relationships, and combining friendship with duties usually undertaken by socially de-
fined kinship roles (Stack, 1975). The community of residence of the very poor, however, 
lacks the employment opportunities and the support of major institutions that were avail-
able to many immigrant families at the turn of the century (Wilson, 1987). Those people 
in the worst poverty conditions form segments of African-American, American Indian, 
Hispanic, and white, often of rural background, American communities, for whom a 
vicious circle of factors, including discrimination, lack of resources, and internal interde-
pendence, make out-movement difficult (Stack, 1975). Female-headed households in this 
part of America's population are often dependent not only on Aid to Families with De-
pendent Children, but also on a variety of different resources that contribute small sums 
of money, products, or services (Edin &amp; Lein, 1997). In the case of American Indians, 
the whole history of relations with the United States government involved dislocation, 
cultural disintegration, and social segregation, leading to numerous problems in all so-
cial roles. Wilkinson (1987) concludes that the history of family relations among native 
Americans has prevented movement of nuclear families away from their elderly and other 
kinship relations: 
</p>
<p>Though variable, kinship bonding and obligations to relatives remain essential in familial interac-
</p>
<p>tion. . . ; They include residential propinquity, obligatory mutual aid, active participation in life </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Social Roles 239 
</p>
<p>cycle events, and central figures around whom family ceremonies revolve. . . . Women play funda-
</p>
<p>mental roles in these extended systems. . . . In many Indian tribes, the descent of children and the 
</p>
<p>ownership of property are traced through the mother's line. (pp. 191-192). 
</p>
<p>Thus, the role of mother in such families is central to women and includes numerous 
relatives in the circle. The reservation housing of native Americans is very different from 
the communities of Puerto Ricans, whose underclass members tend to live in internally 
segregated areas of inner cities. Puerto Rican culture is very patriarchal, although "tradi-
tional norms of obedience and respect for adults, rules pertaining to endogamy, and those 
governing male-female behavior have been modified" (Wilkinson, 1987, p. 192). There 
remains a great deal of gender separation, women helping each other in their various 
roles, with men being more distant as husbands and fathers. A similar pattern exists 
among immigrant Mexican-Americans. 
</p>
<p>Asians have a different history in America, with different family results. In early 
years of American development, anti-Chinese discriminatory laws created "split house-
hold families," the men coming from China for work, and returning only occasionally to 
father children. The mothers remained in China with the children, because of laws for-
bidding Chinese women from entering the United States. They also took care of the eld-
erly in-laws for whom the son was technically responsible. The prejudice against daugh-
ters continued as families became united in America, being seen as expensive "temporary 
members" and reputedly sold by families to become prostitutes in the new land (Dill, 
1995, pp. 247-248). The abolition of the 1880s Exclusion Act in 1943 enabled the reunifi-
cation of families, assisted by community associations. Community cooperation and the 
use of the American educational system have helped upward mobility of Asian families 
that started at the bottom of the social class ladder in the wider society. 
</p>
<p>The employed, not-extremely poor part of the working-class, blue-collar couples 
and parents usually came from immigrant backgrounds, from Europe and now from var-
ied countries on other continents. Those who settled in urban areas built "Polonias," 
"Little Italics," or "Chinatowns" with institutional complexity and an interweaving of 
relationships (Lopata, 1994b). Parents generally retained patriarchal roles, with tight 
discipline unless the street life of the children engrossed them in its own code of behavior 
(Kohn, 1977; Langman, 1987). Kinship members appeared often in the circle of mothers 
and in-laws in the circle of wives. Husbands and wives worked hard, the men in unre-
warding jobs, the women taking in boarders and contributing elsewhere in the informal 
labor market. Rubin (1976) describes the roles of wife and mother, husband and father of 
such families in Worlds of Pain. Ethnic families gradually moved out of the ethnic ghet-
tos to the outskirts of cities and, by the third generation, to the suburbs. Such mobility, 
however, makes difficult kinship contacts, so that relatives are less apt to be involved in 
each other's social circles than in the past. As they move away from ethnic backgrounds, 
working-class families adopt middle-class values, adding to this large band of American 
social structure. 
</p>
<p>The combination of Jewish religious and American democratic middle-class values 
among even lower-class Jewish immigrants led to great sacrifices for the education of the 
young in the American educational system, in addition to traditional Hebrew schools. 
Such an emphasis paid off in upward mobility, as the offspring moved up the occupa-
tional ladder into professions and out of the ghettos into those suburbs that did not have 
discriminatory practices (Lopata, 1994a, p. 83). The same value system and strict learn-
ing schedules enforced by families have also helped Asians move out of socioeconomic 
areas of initial geographical and social settlement. Of course, some immigrants, such as </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>240 Helena Znaniecka Lopata 
</p>
<p>early Cubans or families from modern Hong Kong, came with language and occupational 
abilities and financial resources that put them immediately into the middle class. In fact, 
immigration into United States has often been a multiclass phenomenon, with the ability 
to reproduce social status in the home country in America highly dependent upon knowl-
edge of English and the transferability of occupations, as evidenced by new waves of 
Poles coming to this country (Lopata, 1994a). In general, however, traditional norms of 
family behavior, including a strong division of labor and responsibility within the roles of 
wife and husband, mother and father, remain among upwardly mobile ethnic individuals 
who form the main part of the working class in this society. 
</p>
<p>Stacey (1992) found great complexities in the interweaving of race, class, and gen-
der among postmodern families in the Silicon Valley, especially as blue-collar jobs de-
clined and two-earner couples expanded when women entered the labor force. 
</p>
<p>3.2. The Middle Class 
</p>
<p>Upward mobility has been experienced by most Americans, with the exception of those in 
the current underclass. Mobility was accomplished through education and occupational 
achievement and was accompanied by geographical movement into "nicer" neighborhoods 
and suburbs. The successful movers were primarily white, but some African-Americans 
began moving out, often meeting serious problems with neighbors or finding only segre-
gated areas in suburbia. It is within such families that the two-person career thrived for 
decades and that the greatest amount of change has been occurring recently. The couples 
that moved away from the old neighborhoods after World War II created a whole new life, 
dissimilar from that of their more ethnically and racially identified families (Lopata, 
1971). Having mastered the new home, community, and way of mothering, with the help 
of Dr. Spock's baby books, women started moving out into occupational roles, as men-
tioned previously, creating role strain in their role of wife and conflicts within the role 
cluster. Recent migration waves of Asians and various groups of Hispanics are now mov-
ing to suburbia at a more rapid rate. Among these new members of the middle class, roles 
are becoming much more flexible, with some protest by privilege-losing husbands and 
fathers and some ideational coverups camouflaging continued asymmetry of responsibilities, 
as mentioned previously. I will discuss some of the role conflicts in a later section. 
</p>
<p>3.3.The Upper Class 
</p>
<p>Although some of the women of the upper class are converting the skills they developed 
</p>
<p>in volunteer work and tasks of status development and maintenance into paid occupa-
</p>
<p>tions, many are still restricted in several ways within the world of organized jobs. In the 
</p>
<p>first place, the whole structure of this class is built upon their unpaid work in the commu-
</p>
<p>nity, the husband's career and child socialization. The servants that they pull into their 
</p>
<p>various social circles must be hired, trained, and supervised, which are time- and energy-
</p>
<p>consuming tasks. The activities of associates of the offspring also need organization, 
</p>
<p>transportation, and supervision. The home and how it is used are symbols of the husband's 
</p>
<p>success and of the wife's ability to maintain social status. Volunteer work beautifying and 
</p>
<p>making smooth the functioning of the community in which they live is still needed, al-</p>
<p/>

<p>Gender and Social Roles 241 
</p>
<p>though some adjustments in time of day and rhythm are made in cases of occupational 
involvement. Such involvement is, however, seriously discouraged because of the needs 
of the roles required of the women. Daniels (1988) and Ostrander (1984) describe in 
great detail not only the work, but also the feelings of class and community obligations, 
shared by the wives and mothers in the upper class of America, and descriptions of the 
duties of women of this class in other countries abound. The husbands remain in jobs or 
moneymaking ventures that are inflexible and demanding of their time and attention. 
</p>
<p>4.GENDER AND PUBLIC ROLES 
</p>
<p>When the constructed reality distinguished sharply between two spheres, women's in-
volvement in the public sphere, aside from that which was required of them in the roles of 
wife, mother, or homemaker, was simply ignored. Women were earning money, products, 
or services in a variety of ways and performed politically or religiously significant work 
without carrying official titles. Unmarried women were employed, in fact, in many types 
of jobs besides farming and, when these developed into occupations, in nursing and teach-
ing. However, most of the high-status occupations, especially in the professions and orga-
nizational management, were closed to women, or employed only a few as tokens (Kanter, 
1977). Women also participated in the activities of all the other public institutions, but 
often in subsidiary roles with much resistance to their gain of higher positions, as evi-
denced in many struggles in religious organizations. This section is devoted to the com-
plexities of women's entrance into a variety of occupations and levels of authority in the 
world of organized, paid, work. 
</p>
<p>A major obstacle to women's entry into male-dominated occupations has been the 
assumed lack of match between the necessary characteristics of the social person in a 
particular occupation and the personality characteristics inevitably connected with each 
gender. American culture contains stereotypes of occupations&mdash;what kind of person is 
most suited to perform surgical operations (rational and scientific) or teach little children 
(caring)&mdash;as well as gender-specific temperamental and physical characteristics. These 
stereotypes grew out of the two-sphere world ideology&mdash;women are caring, men are sci-
entific and rational. One of the commonly held images, used as justification for not hiring 
women into high-level positions, has been that women do not like complexity in their 
jobs. A major study of Chicago area women aged 25 to 54 (Lopata, Miller, &amp; Barnewolt, 
1984) found this not to be true (see also Lopata, Barnewolt, &amp; Miller, 1985). Women who 
expressed satisfaction with their jobs also perceived them to be "more complex than the 
average job" along several dimensions, such as work complexity, opportunity for self-
development, independence, and creativity. An interesting aspect of the women's percep-
tions of job complexity is that they considered not only tasks but also social relations. 
Thus, even jobs that the United States Department of Labor's (1965) Dictionary of Occu-
pational Titles: Vol. 1, Defintion of Title considered low in complexity such as nurse's 
aide or beautician, received high-complexity scores on some dimensions by more than 
half of the Chicago employees. The aides accepted the medical ideology of helping people 
get well, the beauticians the cultural ideology that they make people look good and in-
crease their self-respect. Sales clerks did not see their jobs as complex and had low scores 
on our scales, but sales agents scored high, especially on independence and responsibili-
ty. Women who managed single-parent households considered their job to be less com-</p>

</p>
<p>plex than did the managers of aduhs-only households, several comments leading us to 
conclude that the absence of a husband/father simplified rather than complicated life. 
</p>
<p>Our study questioned another assumption concerning women: their commitment to 
their occupation (see Lopata, 1993b; Schrimsher, 1996,1998). American society assumes 
that women, regardless of family roles, will not be as strongly committed to their occupa-
tions and employing organizations as will men. We found many of the Chicago women, 
particularly the younger ones, investing serious "side bets" into their general commit-
ment to the role of career/worker. This included occupational preparation in the past and 
planned future in an appropriate school or training center, selection of a job that would 
meet their career needs, marriage to a man who supported these decisions, self-image in 
terms of that occupational title, and congruence of constructed reality. However, some of 
these side bets were difficult to maintain, especially after entrance into the role of mother. 
Schrimsher (1998) used the same side bet theory and found that women graduates of Case 
Western Reserve University Law School in 1981 were less successful in 1991 in their 
career progress than were the men. The men were less apt to marry persons in demanding 
occupations and more apt to receive practical support from partners than were the women. 
Initial investment in the career throughout law school and early job search and willing-
ness to commit time and energy heavily in the occupation did not pay off as well for the 
women as for the men, not because of their lack of commitment to their career, but due to 
the strength of the occupational-gender system, built during the two-sphere world times, 
that favors men and expects women to allow priority to husbands' jobs. 
</p>
<p>One of the problems with current attempts to use stereotypes of occupation and of 
gender in analyses of the influence of gender on the world of paid work is their focus on 
the characteristics of only the social person. The assumption is made, or implied, not only 
that all women (or all men, for that matter) are alike, but also that all jobs with the same 
title are alike. This ignores the fact that all social roles are negotiated sets of relations of 
a social person with all the members of the role's social circle. Obviously, therefore, each 
social role builds uniquely as the relations develop. This chapter's social role theory thus 
points to the illogicality of occupational stereotyping and can help illuminate the diver-
sity of gender identities depending on job and setting. Assumption of a single pervasive 
identity of "woman" or "man" ignores the many nuances in a variety of settings of social 
persons in different jobs. Waitresses act and are related to as different persons than wait-
ers, but also as different from women teachers. The recent expansion of women into a 
variety of occupations shows an even greater variety of ways in which a woman's perva-
sive identity varies by, for example, whether she is a truck driver or professor, manager or 
artist. In studying settings of employed women, I (Lopata, 1994) kept noticing how dif-
ferent were these roles depending also on the composition of the social circle. Teachers of 
small children, for example, behave differently than teachers of college students. The 
latter do not have to deal with the parents of their pupils. Kanter (1977) introduced the 
concept of token, pointing out that a token woman in a man's occupation in an industrial 
organization has very different relationships with others than does a woman in the same 
occupation when a significant number of workers have the same identity. A physician 
often relates to men patients differently from women patients and those relations are 
influenced by which assistants, such as nurses, receptionists, or technicians, are in his/ 
her circle. A manager interacts with employees differently if they are relatives in a family 
business than if they are simply occupiers of a job. A surgeon in a MASH unit must 
function in innovative ways not necessary if she or he has all the personal or technologi-
cal resources of a hospital. </p>

<p>Gender and Social Roles 243 
</p>
<p>5. GENDER ASPECTS OF ROLE CONFLICT 
</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, role conflict is usually referred to in terms of the role cluster of 
any one individual. Typically in recent American history, such conflict has been per-
ceived in the role cluster of women, especially when they began to officially enter the 
world of greedy and prestigeful occupations. However, conflict between various aspects 
of work in the home and in family roles had been (and often still is) taken for granted as 
normal. Work in the informal market, such as taking care of boarders or taking in laun-
dry, even employment in lower-status jobs, such as domestic, has also been neglected as a 
source of role conflict. It has long been acceptable for single women to hold jobs, regard-
less of their other roles. It is when women began to enter the world of prestigeful occupa-
tions, originally monopolized by men and organized with the rights and privileges of the 
male sphere, that American media and male family scientists began loud warnings. First, 
they warned women that such behavior was inappropriate because it conflicted with their 
obligations in the role of wife&mdash;hurting the husband's career by neglecting duties owed 
him. Next came the warning that the children were being hurt because jobs make impos-
sible 24-hour presence in and around the home, as preached in the "fantasy of the perfect 
mother" (Chodorow &amp; Contratto, 1982); although it was all right for her to be absent for 
volunteer work, which was needed by the community, as Daniels (1988) discovered in her 
research. The whole argument about the need for constant mothering ignores the centu-
ries during which children were taken care of mainly by servants or sent to other people's 
homes as servants to be properly socialized into society (Aries, 1965). The latest argu-
ment has been that occupational involvement is bad for the woman herself, because it 
causes serious anxiety, a harried and pulled apart life, and guilt. This is a good example 
of constructed person-role cluster strain, in which there is an assumed conflict between 
what a person is and what the roles demand. Although this set of arguments about the 
inevitability of role conflict in the lives of women is still directed mainly toward those 
with small children, it often is extended to all women, regardless of marital or parental 
roles. People seem less concerned with role conflict in lesbian partnerships, possibly 
because these have been relatively invisible and only recently are recognized as possibly 
also involving children. 
</p>
<p>6. CONCLUSIONS 
</p>
<p>The social roles of men, but especially of women, have changed considerably in recent 
</p>
<p>decades in America and other developed nations, moving away at least partially from the 
</p>
<p>restrictions of the two-sphere world. Even before these dramatic changes, the two-sphere 
</p>
<p>world existed mainly as a constructed ideology that ignored much of what went on in 
</p>
<p>human life in America and Europe. Its strength lay in that it formed a consistent base of 
</p>
<p>childhood socialization by forcing gender differentiation and social role segregation. 
</p>
<p>However, as with all ideologies, it narrowed and constricted humans. It has taken a great 
</p>
<p>deal of consciousness raising and innovative behavior to understand its detrimental ef-
</p>
<p>fects and to open up new opportunities for role changes. This chapter is an attempt to 
</p>
<p>analyze some of the revolutionary changes in pervasive gendered identities of both social 
</p>
<p>persons at the center of social roles and of members of their social circles that provide 
</p>
<p>resources and rights, and receive these from the person. Social roles have changed consid-
</p>
<p>erably, not only in the characteristics of social persons, but also in the composition of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>244 Helena Znaniecka Lopata 
</p>
<p>social circles. This is apparent in the few social roles we have examined here, those of 
wife and husband, mother and father, and those in the public sphere of labor force workers. 
</p>
<p>Although each culture contains models of various social roles, the role itself is car-
ried forth in negotiated cooperation between the social person and circle members. The 
more complex and internally diversified the society and heterogeneous the culture, the 
greater the possibility of role strain and role conflict as people get together to carry forth 
social roles. What is surprising about social life in American society is not that such 
problems arise, but that people can actually carry forth their roles together. Social change 
is not even; it affects members of a society, and therefore social persons and circle mem-
bers, at different rates and in different ways. Recently, wives and mothers have been 
changing their role definitions at a more rapid rate and in different ways than husbands 
and fathers, the composition and behavior of their social circles often differing from that 
of the social persons. The complexity of the interweaving of social roles can be illustrated 
by problems in attempts to introduce occupational changes in complex organizations 
based on a Weberian logical and rational model. These efforts often, if not usually, ne-
glect to take into account the social roles of their employees as interdependent sets of 
relations. Gerald Handel (1967) and associates have repeatedly warned family practitio-
ners that the psychological interior of the family must be recognized when attempts are 
made to change the behavior of one member. Changes in the behavior of one individual 
have repercussions on the members of each of the social circles in which she or he is 
involved (see also Lopata, 1990). It is no wonder that sociologists have a difficult time 
analyzing any social role or role cluster.

<p>Gender and Interaction

</p>
<p>Gender is a system of social practices within society that constitutes people as different in 
socially significant ways and organizes relations of inequality on the basis of the differ-
ence. Like other systems of difference and inequality, such as race or class, gender in-
volves widely shared cultural beliefs and institutions at the macro-level of analysis, be-
haviors and expectations at the interactional level, and self-conceptions and attitudes at 
the individual level of analysis. Although each component is important, events at the 
interactional level may be especially important for the maintenance or change of the 
gender system. Compared to people on opposite sides of class and racial divides, men and 
women in the United States interact with one another frequently, often on familiar, even 
intimate terms. 
</p>
<p>1. THE GENDER SYSTEM AND INTERACTION 
</p>
<p>Unlike most social differences, gender divides people into two groups of roughly equal 
</p>
<p>size. Since whom you interact with is partly determined by who is available, two equal 
</p>
<p>sized groups creates the maximum structural likelihood that people in both groups will 
</p>
<p>have ample contact with the other group (Blau &amp; Schwartz, 1984). The relevance of one's 
</p>
<p>sex category for sexual behavior and reproduction also increases the rate of interaction 
</p>
<p>between most men and women. Finally, unlike race or class, gender almost always cross-
</p>
<p>cuts kinship. Most people have opposite sex family members with whom they interact, be

<p>they spouses, parents, children, or siblings. Given all the forces that keep men and women 
interacting with one another, the gender system of difference and inequality would be 
impossible to sustain if interactional events were not organized to support it. 
</p>
<p>Not only does the high rate of interaction between the sexes make the interactional 
level important for the gender system as a whole, but it also has significant consequences 
for the way gender shapes behavior in interaction. Gender appears to be deeply entwined 
with the basic cultural rules people use to organize their interaction with others (Ridgeway, 
1997; West &amp; Zimmerman, 1997). Coordinating interaction requires at least a minimal 
cultural definition of "who" self and other are. Perhaps because it is a simple, quick, 
habitually used cultural dichotomy, evidence suggests that people employ gender this 
way even when other definitions are available (e.g., employer-employee). Social cogni-
tion research has shown that people automatically sex categorize (i.e., label as male or 
female) any other with whom they interact (Brewer &amp; Lui, 1989). Sex category is one of 
only two or three "primary" social categories that our culture has constituted as necessary 
to make sufficient sense out of another in relation to self so that interaction can proceed. 
When self and other are categorized on other social dimensions as well (e.g., occupation) 
those conceptions are nested within the prior understanding of self and other as male or 
female, often with subsequent consequences for expectations and behavior (Brewer &amp; 
Lui, 1989). 
</p>
<p>Sex categorization may seem a "natural" process but ethnomethodologists have shown 
it to be substantially socially constructed (Kessler &amp; McKenna, 1978; West &amp; Zimmerman, 
1987). In everyday interaction people sex categorize each other based on appearance and 
other cues that are culturally presumed to stand for physical sex differences. Automatic, 
taken-for-granted sex categorization of actors seems to be a fundamental part of organiz-
ing interaction. 
</p>
<p>The high rate of interaction between men and women has other consequences for the 
way gender shapes behavior. The continued, everyday acceptance of the gender system 
requires that men and women be understood as sufficiently different in ways that justify 
men's greater power and privilege. The problem of accomplishing this despite constant 
contact and opportunities for mutual influence probably contributes to the unusually pre-
scriptive nature of the gender stereotypes that shape people's behavior in interaction, 
compared to race or class stereotypes (Fiske &amp; Stevens, 1993; Jackman, 1994). People 
feel freer to criticize and otherwise sanction perceived violations of gender expectations 
than they do violations of race or class expectations (Fiske &amp; Stevens, 1993). 
</p>
<p>The deep involvement of gender in the organization of interaction raises complex 
issues for studying its impact on behavior. In interaction, people are always many things 
in addition to their sex. Simple, dichotomous sex categories may make easy starting 
places, but, by the same token, they are too diffuse to adequately frame behavior in most 
contexts. People virtually always classify self and other in additional and more specific 
ways such as age, ethnicity, and institutional role. As a result, the interactional conduct of 
gender is always enmeshed in other identities and activities. It cannot be observed in a 
pure, unentangled form. 
</p>
<p>This complexity is a challenge for theories of gender and interaction. It also raises 
significant methodological issues for empirical studies. In drawing conclusions about 
gender differences in interaction, for instance, we must be careful not to attribute to 
gender behavioral effects that are caused by actors' other social positions and differences. 
Given the widespread division of labor and authority by sex in our society, male and 
female interactants are frequently unequal in important ways besides gender. As a conse-</p>

<p>Gender and Interaction 249 
</p>
<p>quence, commonly observed gender differences in interaction are often deceptive and 
misleading. Close attention to the context in which interaction occurs is necessary when 
interpreting the evidence for gender effects. 
</p>
<p>We begin by reviewing five current theoretical approaches that seek to explain how 
gender shapes behavior in interaction and how, in turn, the recurring patterns or struc-
tures of interaction that emerge from this behavior sustain (and potentially could under-
mine) the gender system. Absent from our survey is the familiar approach that attributes 
gendered behavior in interaction to stable differences in men's and women's personalities 
or traits (e.g., dominance or nuturance) that they have acquired through socialization 
(e.g., Parsons &amp; Bales, 1955). In recent years, evidence has accumulated that men's and 
women's gender-related behavior varies substantially with changes in the situational con-
text. A woman who is a tough taskmaster at work may be deferential and passive with her 
husband. As a result, researchers have increasingly turned away from a simple, social-
ized-trait approach (see, e.g., Aries, 1996; Deaux &amp; Major, 1987; Eagly, 1987; Meeker &amp; 
Weitzel-O'Neill, 1977; Ridgeway, 1992 for reviews). It is not that gendered selves, atti-
tudes, or beliefs do not develop through socialization or that they have no impact on 
interaction. Rather, conceptualizing gendered selves as stable traits or dispositions that 
exert a constant effect on behavior across situations does not appear to be an adequate 
way to account for the impact of gendered selves on interaction. After surveying current 
theoretical approaches to gender and interaction we will turn to the empirical evidence 
for gender's effects on patterns of interaction. 
</p>
<p>2. THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO GENDER AND INTERACTION 
</p>
<p>2.1. The Two-Cultures Approach 
</p>
<p>Drawing an analogy from studies of interethnic communication, Maltz and Borker (1982) 
propose that men and women learn different cultural rules for engaging in interaction 
and interpreting their own and others' behavior. They argue that people acquire rules for 
interacting with peers (i.e., those who are not formal superiors or subordinates) from 
childhood peer groups. Because children's peer groups tend to be gender segregated and 
because children accentuate stereotypic gender differences in the process of learning gen-
der roles, these peer groups develop different gender-typed cultures. As a result, boys and 
girls learn different cultural rules for interaction. Boys learn to use speech to compete for 
attention in the group and assert positions of dominance. Girls learn to use speech to 
maintain close, equal relations, to criticize in nonchallenging ways, and to interpret ac-
curately other's intentions (Maccoby, 1990; Maltz &amp; Borker, 1982). These taken-for-
granted rules of interaction carry into adulthood, shaping men's and women's interaction. 
</p>
<p>In mixed-sex interaction, the result can be miscommunication because men and 
women have learned to attribute different meanings to the same behavior (Maltz &amp; Borker, 
1982). However, the effort to accommodate each other's different interactional goals in 
conversation modifies men's and women's behavior slightly, reducing gender differences. 
In same-sex interaction, on the other hand, gendered styles of interaction are reinforced. 
Thus the two cultures approach predicts that gender differences in behavior will be greater 
between men and women in same-sex contexts than in mixed-sex contexts. 
</p>
<p>The two cultures argument has gained wide attention thanks to popular presenta-
tions, such as Tannen's (1990) You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversa-</p>
<p/>

<p>250 Cecilia L. Ridgeway AND Lynn Smith-Lovin 
</p>
<p>tion. However, criticism of this work among researchers has grown. Aries (1996), who 
earlier found the approach persuasive, concludes from her recent review of the evidence 
that it is seriously flawed. Some problems are logical. Since adult men and women (in 
contrast to members of different ethnic groups) interact daily, and mixed-sex interaction 
moderates gender differences, why don't men's and women's different cultural rules even-
tually break down, especially since they cause misunderstandings and problems in inter-
action? Also, since many children interact closely with opposite sex siblings in addition 
to same-sex friends, could separate cultures really develop at all? 
</p>
<p>Other problems are empirical. There is no consistent pattern of greater gender dif-
ferences between same-sex groups than within mixed-sex groups&mdash;the results are contra-
dictory depending on the behavior and context (Aries, 1996). Also, there is little reliable 
evidence that men and women consistently misunderstand one another or that they can-
not understand each other quite well in long-term relationships. Thome's (1993) studies 
of children's play groups suggests as well that they are more diverse in their rules of 
interaction than is represented in the two cultures approach. 
</p>
<p>2.2. Doing Gender 
</p>
<p>"Doing gender" is an ethnomethodological perspective that claims that gender itself is an 
interactional accomplishment, something that must be continually achieved in local in-
teractional contexts to persist as a social phenomenon (West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1993; West 
&amp; Zimmerman, 1987). Institutionalized cultural norms dictate that there are two and 
only two sexes, each with certain "inherent" natures that imply and justify male domi-
nance. However, the maintenance of these norms requires that people present themselves 
in interaction in culturally defined ways that allow others to sex categorize them un-
equivocally as male or female and hold them accountable for behaving in ways that are 
normatively appropriate to their sex category. 
</p>
<p>Gender, as opposed to sex (cultural rules for sex assignment, usually at birth) or sex 
categorization (labeling as male or female in everyday interaction), is the local manage-
ment of conduct in relation to normative conceptions of appropriate behavior and atti-
tudes for one's sex category (West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987). Thus gender is an adverb rather 
than a noun in this perspective, something one "does" rather than "is." It is a quality (i.e., 
"womanly" or "manly") with which a person carries out any behavior during interaction. 
To be effective, this quality must be recognized as a culturally competent gender perfor-
mance by others present. Sex category is "omnirelevant" in interaction, so that one can be 
held accountable for engaging in any activity in a gender-appropriate way, even in situa-
tions that are not institutionally gendered: a woman may be a physician and acknowl-
edged as such in the situation, but she can still be held accountable for being womanly in 
her conduct as a physician. 
</p>
<p>The concept of gender as something one does has been very influential, as has the 
recognition that sex categorization in interaction is a distinct and important aspect of the 
gender process. However, the "doing gender" approach has been more important as an orient-
ing perspective than as a predictive theory of gender's impact on behavior in interaction (but 
see Brines, 1994 for a predictive application to the household division of labor). Perhaps 
this is because the "doing gender" approach offers no explicit guidelines for the circum-
stances under which the salience of gender (i.e., the situated pressures for gender ac-
countability) will vary, producing stronger or weaker gender differences in behavior. </p>
<p/>

<p>Gender and Interaction 251 
</p>
<p>2.3. Eagly's Social Role Theory 
</p>
<p>Eagly (1987; Eagly &amp; Wood, 1991) has proposed a broad theory of gender differences 
that locates their source in the situational roles that men and women play. In our society, 
homemaker roles are assigned almost exclusively to women while powerful, higher-sta-
tus work roles are occupied disproportionately by men. People form their gender role 
expectations from observing men and women around them. They see men, because of the 
requirements of their more powerful work roles, engaging in more agentic (instrumental, 
assertive) behaviors than women and women, owing to their homemaker roles, enacting 
more communal (friendly, concerned with others, emotionally expressive) behaviors. Be-
sides creating stereotypic gender role expectations, society's gender division of labor creates 
gender-typed skills and beliefs by providing men and women with different experiences. 
</p>
<p>Behavior in general is determined by the social roles that are most salient in a given 
situation. Thus when a male physician and a female nurse interact in a hospital, their 
behavior is shaped by the power, status, and norms of their work roles rather than by 
gender, per se. In the same formal role (e.g., CEO), the theory predicts that men and 
women will act similarly. Evidence supports this in the case of leadership behavior in 
management roles (Eagly &amp; Johnson, 1990; Johnson, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Gender role expectations shape behavior directly only when other roles are ambigu-
ous. Eagly (1987) argues that this is the case in most laboratory research settings and 
accounts for the gender differences observed in many laboratory studies. Anything that 
makes gender roles more salient in a situation (e.g., a mixed-sex setting, a culturally gen-
dered context) increases their impact and thus the likelihood that men's and women's 
behavior will differ in stereotypic fashion (Eagly &amp; Wood, 1991). However, gender can 
also indirectly affect how men and women enact other roles by shaping the skills and 
beliefs individuals have acquired over their lives. Thus when an interactional task re-
quires communal skills, women will generally perform better than men and be more influ-
ential in that setting (Wood, 1987). When the task is heavily agentic, both men and 
women will act more agentically, but men's past experiences will give them the advantage. 
</p>
<p>Thus social role theory predicts that if we look around us we will often see men 
acting more agentically in interaction than women and women acting more communally 
than men. In most settings, however, these differences will be due to differences in the 
situational roles that men and women are playing rather than to gender. Only in situa-
tions where gender is highly salient or the task draws on sex-typed skills will such differ-
ences be attributable to gender itself. Furthermore, when women are in agentic situational 
roles (e.g., boss), or when men are in communal roles (e.g., flight attendant) each will act 
in a counter-gender manner in accord with the requirements of his or her role. Because of 
its generality and sensitivity to situational variation and context, Eagly's role theory is 
widely cited in the research literature. 
</p>
<p>2.4. Status Characteristics and Expectation States 
</p>
<p>Another widely cited and well documented theory is expectation states theory. It argues 
that many, although not all, of the effects of gender on interaction are attributable to the 
greater status value attached to being male rather than female in western culture (Berger, 
Fisek, Norman, &amp; Zelditch, 1977; Carli, 1991; Ridgeway, 1993; Wagner &amp; Berger, 1997). 
Gender stereotypes not only associate men and women with different specific skills (e.g., </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>252 Cecilia L. Ridgeway AND Lynn Smitli-Lovin 
</p>
<p>child care or mechanics) they also attach greater status worthiness and general compe-
tence to men than women, making gender a status characteristic (Broverman, Vogel, 
Broverman, Clarkson, &amp; Rosenkrantz, 1972). 
</p>
<p>Expectation states is not a theory of gender, per se, but a theory of the way character-
istics of people that carry status value in the surrounding society shape the power and 
prestige hierarchies that emerge when they interact. It addresses interactions in which 
actors are oriented toward the accomplishment of a shared goal and seeks to explain 
behaviors, such as influence, participation, evaluation and allocation of rewards, that are 
related to inequalities in power and prestige in the situation. It acknowledges 
socioemotional behaviors, but considers them outside the pervue of the theory. Influence 
and power in interpersonal relations, particularly in goal-oriented situations, have im-
portant consequences for the social positions of wealth and power that individuals attain. 
Consequently, this theory claims to explain a range of gender differences in interaction 
that are especially important for understanding gender inequality. 
</p>
<p>When people are focused on a collective goal, they look for ways to anticipate the 
likely usefulness of their own suggestions, compared to those of others, in order to decide 
whether to speak up, whom to listen to, and with whose choices to agree. They form 
implicit performance expectations for each actor in the situation compared with the oth-
ers. When gender stereotypes and the status beliefs they entail are salient, because they 
provide a basis for distinguishing the actors (i.e., a mixed-sex context, see Cota &amp; Dion, 
1986), or are relevant to the situation because they are linked by cultural beliefs to skill at 
the shared goal (e.g., a gender-typed task), they affect the actors' expectations for each 
other's performance in that situation. Performance expectations, in turn, shape behavior 
and others' reactions in a self-fulfilling manner. When gender status is salient, both a 
man and a woman will implicitly assume that he is a little more competent and has a little 
more to offer than she. Lower performance expectations for her compared to him make 
her less likely to offer task suggestions and more likely to ask for his ideas, to evaluate his 
ideas positively and her's negatively, and to accept his influence in task decisions, creat-
ing a behavioral power and prestige order that advantages him over her. 
</p>
<p>Because of the effects of gender status beliefs, the theory predicts that in mixed-sex 
interactions between men and women who are otherwise equals, men will, on average, be 
more influential, tend to offer more task suggestions, act more confidently and asser-
tively, be evaluated as more competent for the equivalent performance, and expect and 
receive greater rewards than the women. Evidence supports this (Carli, 1991; Dovidio, 
Brown, Heltman, Ellyson, &amp; Keating, 1988; Pugh &amp; Wahrman, 1983; Wagner &amp; Berger, 
1997; Wood &amp; Karten, 1986). Men's advantage over women will be increased further if 
the task is stereotypically masculine (Carli, 1991; Dovidio et al., 1988). When the task is 
stereotypically feminine, women should have a performance expectation advantage over 
men and be more influential and assertive than them, as Dovidio et al. (1988) and Wagner, 
Ford, and Ford (1986) have shown. 
</p>
<p>The theory predicts that in same-sex interaction, gender will shape performance 
expectations only when the task is gender typed in the culture. A "feminine" task will 
encourage women's assertive, task-related behavior and discourage men's in same-sex 
groups, while a "masculine" task will produce the opposite effects. When the task is 
gender neutral, men and women in same sex groups should not differ in their absolute 
rates of task behavior, as evidence indicates (Johnson, Clay-Warner, &amp; Funk, 1996; Wagner 
&amp; Berger, 1997). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Interaction 253 
</p>
<p>One of the strengths of this theory is that it explicitly attends to other status-related 
attributes of actors (e.g., race, occupation, education, expertise) that may be salient in the 
situation besides gender. It argues that actors combine the positive and negative implica-
tions of all salient status information, weighted by the relevance of each to the situational 
task, to form aggregated performance expectations for self and others, which in turn 
shape each person's task behaviors, power, and prestige. As a result, the effects of gender 
on actors' influence and standing in the situation may be overwhelmed (or exacerbated) 
by countervailing factors (Wagner et al., 1986). Thus gender is not a master status in this 
approach. Its effects are situationally variable, but predictably so, advantaging men not 
over all women but over women who are otherwise their equals in most situations. 
</p>
<p>In addition to creating differences in the likelihood of becoming influential, expec-
tation states theory argues that gender status beliefs, when salient, can affect the extent to 
which men and women are perceived to have a right, based on cultural expectations, to 
hold a position of influence and respect in the setting. Gender status beliefs can cause 
actors to assume implicitly that men are more legitimate candidates for high standing in 
the situation than equivalent women (Ridgeway, Johnson &amp; Diekema, 1994). Such legiti-
macy effects add a prescriptive element to gender-based performance expectations. In 
trying to overcome others' low expectations for her by acting assertively in regard to the 
task, a woman may elicit a negative reaction unless she compensates by emphasizing 
her cooperative interest in helping the group (Carli, 1990; Carli, LaFleur, &amp; Loeber, 
1995; Ridgeway, 1982). A woman who attains leadership by virtue of her expertise may 
meet more resistance than a similar man if she tries to go beyond persuasion to exercise 
directive power in the group (Butler &amp; Geis, 1990; Eagly, Makhijani &amp; Klonsky, 
1992). 
</p>
<p>Recently, expectation states theorists have also shown that the enactment of posi-
tions of higher or lower power and prestige in ongoing interactional situations causes the 
participants to attribute more dominant, instrumental traits to those in the high-ranking 
positions and more submissive, emotionally expressive traits to those in lower-ranking 
ones (Gerber, 1996; Wagner &amp; Berger, 1997). This occurs regardless of whether the par-
ticipants are men or women. The effect of gender status beliefs on interaction, however, 
results in men more frequently achieving high power and prestige positions than women. 
As a consequence of this interactional power and prestige advantage, men should more 
frequently be perceived as dominant and instrumental and women as expressive and sub-
missive, contributing to gender stereotypes (Wagner &amp; Berger, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Expectation states theory, then, argues that if we look around, we will usually see 
men acting more assertively, being more influential, and being perceived as more compe-
tent than women. However, these differences are not basic to men and women. They 
result from the self-fuUfilling effects on interaction of cultural stereotypes that ascribe 
greater status and competence to men. When salient in the situation, these status beliefs 
create gender differences in behavior and leadership. But when they are not salient or are 
overwhelmed by other information in the situation, men and women will be similarly 
assertive, competent, and influential. 
</p>
<p>Note that expectation states theory and social role theory make many similar predic-
tions. Expectation states theory is more precise and accurate in predicting how gender 
affects influence and task-related behaviors, particularly in combination with actors' other 
differences such as race or occupation. Role theory makes more specific predictions about 
gender's impact on communal, socioemotional behaviors. </p>

</p>
<p>2.5. Identity Theories 
</p>
<p>Perhaps the closest modern analogue to older gender role socialization approaches are 
the identity theories developed within the structural symbolic interactionist perspective. 
These theories argue that people learn a set of meanings that serve as an idenity standard, 
guiding behavior in situations where that identity is evoked. In the case of gender identi-
ties, conceptions of masculinity and femininity are based on cultural meanings associated 
with being a man or woman in society (Burke, 1991). Researchers in this tradition often 
see gender as a "master identity," a set of meanings that applies to the self across situa-
tions rather than as evoked only by specific institutional contexts (Stets &amp; Burke, 1996). 
Given that some variants of identity theory posit a contrastive definition of masculinity 
and femininity (Burke, 1991)&mdash;being masculine as being not feminine&mdash;the idea that 
men and women act out master gender identities across situations seems quite close to the 
more traditional socialization theories. 
</p>
<p>The crucial difference is the new conceptualization of identity-driven behavior as a 
control system (Burke, 1991; Burke &amp; Reitzes, 1981; Heise, 1979; Smith-Lovin &amp; Heise, 
1988). Rather than conceiving of identity as either something that is fluid and constructed 
anew in each situation (as in the doing gender perspective) or as stable across situations 
(as in the traditional socialization approaches), identity theories now posit a control pro-
cess that leads to both stability and change in identity-driven behavior. Gender meanings 
are learned from societal definitions, and function as a standard of reference for interpret-
ing the implications of interaction. In their interactions with others, people modify their 
behavior to control the perceptions of self-relevant meanings. Therefore, if the interac-
tion is making one seem more feminine than one's fundamentally held gender identity 
standard, then masculine, assertive behavior might result (even if the identity standard 
were quite feminine). On the other hand, a situation such as a work setting that produced 
behavior that was too masculine in relation to that same identity standard, would produce 
behavior that re-affirmed the identity standard by emphasizing traditional femininity. In 
other words, the gendered behavior varies depending on how the meanings generated by 
the interaction relate to the fundamentally held identity standard; people produce a wide 
variety of gendered behavior to maintain their identity meanings. 
</p>
<p>Smith-Lovin and Robinson (1992) use affect control theory (Heise, 1979; Smith-
Lovin &amp; Heise, 1988), one of the identity control theories, to look at how gender identi-
ties are maintained in group conversations. They argue that both socialization and peer-
group interaction lead boys and girls to develop gender identities with rather different 
values on evaluation (niceness), potency (powerfulness), and activity (expressiveness). 
These identities then affect cross-sex interaction and modify other social positions that 
males or females come to occupy (such as male student and female student). Using the 
meanings of these identities and of common conversational behaviors such as "interrupt" 
and "talk to," they modeled the participation and interruption structure of interaction in 
six-person groups. 
</p>
<p>Burke and Stets (1996), using Burke's version of identity theory (Burke, 1991a, 
1991b; Burke &amp; Reitzes, 1981) analyze positive and negative behavior among married 
couples who are trying to resolve a disagreement. They predict and find that those with a 
more masculine identity will be more likely to use negative behavior in interaction, while 
those with a more feminine identity will be more likely to use positive behavior. Interest-
ingly, the results of being masculine/feminine are different from the results of being male/ 
female. They argue that the status effects of being male or female are separate and differ-</p>

</p>
<p>ent in direction from the meanings of masculinity and femininity. This point is supported 
by Stets (1997), who shows that other low-status positions&mdash;age, education, and occupa-
tional status&mdash;operate in the same way. 
</p>
<p>Within this tradition, Burke and Cast (1997) have also explored the ways in which 
people's "reference standard" for gender identity meanings can be shaped by major life 
events. They study the gender identities of newly first-married couples over a 3-year 
period, focusing on the birth of a new child. They find that parental status alters gender 
identity meanings to increase the differences between masculinity and femininity, but 
that role-taking processes lead to convergence of gender roles. 
</p>
<p>The strength of the control-system formulations of identity theory is that they com-
bine two insights about gendered behavior in interaction; interactions are based on what 
we learn about societies' definitions of maleness and femaleness, but these behaviors are 
also situated and flexible; gender is displayed and maintained in different ways in differ-
ent situations. The theory also allows specification of the conditions under which gender 
meanings are likely to change, as a result of life events or societal change. Therefore, 
these perspectives bring a much needed dynamic, processual element to the older gender 
socialization ideas. 
</p>
<p>In differing ways, each of the theoretical approaches we have discussed emphasizes 
the importance of societal beliefs or stereotypes of men and women for expectations and 
behavior in interaction. We must keep in mind, however, that although there is a cultur-
ally hegemonic form of these stereotypes, based on the experiences of white middle-class 
Americans, there are also differences in gender stereotypes by class and race (Connell, 
1995 Filardo, 1996; Messner, 1992; West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1995). Although we have 
enough evidence to recognize that subcultural differences in gender conceptions exist 
and probably affect interaction, there are few detailed studies based on any but white 
middle-class participants. This must be kept in mind in considering the research findings 
we discuss next. 
</p>
<p>3. RESEARCH FINDINGS 
</p>
<p>There is a voluminous body of research on gender and interaction within the disciplines 
of sociology, psychology, and communications. Since we cannot be encyclopedic, we fo-
cus on well-established topics and findings and key studies that illustrate them. 
</p>
<p>3.1. Women's and Men's Interactional Networks 
</p>
<p>We begin with studies of the frequency and types of interactions among men and women. 
</p>
<p>The facts that men and women are roughly equal sized groups and have necessary contact 
</p>
<p>through kin and romantic ties ensure high rates of interaction. However, the network 
</p>
<p>literature makes clear that this interaction is patterned in ways that are significant for the 
</p>
<p>character and content of gender relationships, maintaining difference and inequality. We 
</p>
<p>review the life course differentiation, organizational contexts, and status configurations 
</p>
<p>in which interactions between men and women occur. 
</p>
<p>3.1.1. NETWORKS IN CHILDHOOD. By the time children enter school, they have learned 
</p>
<p>that sex is a permanent personal characteristic. At about the same developmental stage. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>256 Cecilia L. Ridgeway AND Lynn Smitii-Lovin 
</p>
<p>researchers first observe homophily (the choice of similar companions) in play patterns 
and tendency for girls to play in smaller groups than boys (Block, 1979; Lever, 1978). 
Hallinan studied young children's peer relationships, focusing on transitivity in senti-
ment relations and how intransitive relations get resolved. An intransitive sentiment re-
lation is one in which, for any three people in a group, A likes B and B likes C, but A does 
not like C (Hallinan, 1974). Although all children show less tolerance for intransitivity 
as they get older (Hallinan, 1974; Leinhardt, 1973), there are gender differences in how 
intransitivity is usually resolved. Eder and Hallinan (1978) found that girls are more 
likely to resolve intransitivity by deleting friendship choices, while boys are more likely 
to add them. For example, if A Ukes B and B likes C, a young boy would be more likely to 
form an A-C relation to resolve the intransitivity, while a young girl would be more 
likely to drop B as a friend. Furthermore, youths are more likely to delete a friendship 
choice than to resolve the intransitivity by adding a cross-sex friend (Hallinan &amp; 
Kubitschek, 1990). 
</p>
<p>Hallinan's results have important implications for the emergence of cliques and larger 
peer group interactions. Youths tend to have friends who are popular peers of the same 
sex; this tie is likely to be reciprocated if both youths are popular. This stable dyad is most 
likely to expand to a stable, transitive triad if the third person is also of the same sex, is 
popular, and reciprocates the choice. These transitive triads are likely to continue adding 
people (creating more triads) to create cliques of the "popular crowd" of same sex people 
(Hallinan &amp; Kubitschek, 1988, p. 91). Since each new member of a clique creates an 
intransitive structure that must be resolved by adding ties if the clique is to grow, girls are 
less likely to join larger cliques; they tend to resolve intransitivity by dropping, rather 
than adding, friendships. Thus, girls are less likely to extend or receive friendship. Simple, 
small tendencies toward homophily and differences in resolving problems in the struc-
ture of their relationships mean that boys and girls will move toward very different kinds 
of peer social circles. Their worlds become gender segregated, with boys in larger, more 
heterogeneous cliques. 
</p>
<p>Networks and knowledge coevolve, with the connections between individuals creat-
ing shared knowledge which, in turn, shifts interaction propensities (Carley, 1986a, b). 
Over time, knowledge overlap increases between interaction partners and decreases be-
tween people not connected in the network. As peer interactions become more organized 
around gender, strong perceptions of gender differences are likely to be created from in-
group/out-group phenomena and from the different stores of information that these rela-
tively isolated cliques develop. Except for siblings, cross-sex contacts will be embedded in 
more formal authority relations (e.g., teachers, parents), where youth occupy low-status posi-
tions within the interactions. Interactions among status equals in youth (excepting those 
who are thought of in romantic, sexual terms) are almost entirely same-sex interactions. 
</p>
<p>3.1.2. PERSONAL NETWORKS IN THE ADULT YEARS. In adult life men and women 
</p>
<p>usually have networks of similar size (Fischer, 1982; Marsden 1987), but women have 
</p>
<p>fewer ties to non-kin (Fischer &amp; Oliker, 1983; Marsden, 1987; Wellman, 1985). Net-
</p>
<p>works in adulthood show strong sex homophily as well as homophily in race, ethnicity, 
</p>
<p>religion, age, and education (Marsden, 1988). Women typically interact more with kin 
</p>
<p>and neighborhood contacts, which tends to increase the age and sex heterogeneity of their 
</p>
<p>interactions while reducing racial, ethnic and religious diversity. Men, on the other hand, 
</p>
<p>have more ties to co-workers and voluntary group members, which decreases age and sex 
</p>
<p>diversity in their ties (Marsden, 1992). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Interaction 257 
</p>
<p>Fischer and Oliker (1983) found that life course factors are particularly important in 
the development of gender differentiated networks (see also Marsden, 1987, footnote 15). 
Young, unmarried women and men have similar patterns of interaction. Gender differ-
ences accumulate, however, as young adults move into marriage and childbearing years. 
Married women, especially those with children, have fewer people that they can count on 
for support such as personal advice, help with odd jobs, or lending money. The exclusiv-
ity with which infant care is delegated to women may be a fundamental factor; by the time 
men become involved with childrearing of older children, women's networks may be 
fundamentally altered (Smith-Lovin &amp; McPherson, 1992). Wellman (1985) found that 
having children significantly reduced cross-sex contacts for women, moving them into a 
female world of play groups and PTAs. Munch, McPherson, and Smith-Lovin (1997) 
showed that having a young child in the family restricts women's interactions with oth-
ers, but also increases men's embeddedness in female, kin-oriented interactions. A study 
by Lynne Zucker (reported in Aldrich 1989, p. 24) using the "small world" technique 
showed that female networks were more densely interconnected, while men's are more 
extensive and less tightly linked. Interconnectedness has important implications for the 
usefulness of networks; Burt (1992) argued that nonredundancy of ties is more important 
than tie strength in promoting occupational success and other functional benefits of net-
works. 
</p>
<p>Fischer and Oliker (1983) found that women are much more likely to know people 
through their husband's co-worker networks than men are to know their wives' work 
friends. On the one hand, this finding implies that women benefit more from their spouses' 
network position than do men by using their husbands' work contacts to extend their own 
ties. On the other hand, Aldrich (1989) suggests that the pattern may indicate that women 
are more supportive of their husbands' networks than vice versa. Contacts that women 
make through their husbands may be less useful to women in work-related spheres, and 
supportive only of their roles as wives. 
</p>
<p>In a study of recent job changers in four white-collar occupations, Campbell (1988) 
reinforced the view that women are less tied to work peers and more affected by life 
course factors and geographic mobility than men. She found that women interact with 
people in fewer occupations than men; in particular, their networks have a "floor" that 
eliminates lower status occupations. Women's occupational networks are negatively af-
fected by their having children under 6 years of age and by changing jobs in response to 
their spouses' mobility. When the women in Campbell's study moved with their hus-
bands, their networks reached fewer high-status and fewer low-status occupations. 
</p>
<p>3.1.3. ORGANIZATIONS AND THE INTERACTIONS EMBEDDED IN THEM. McPherson and 
</p>
<p>Smith-Lovin (1982) argued that voluntary group activities create an opportunity struc-
</p>
<p>ture for social interaction and tie formation. Earlier research has shown that members 
</p>
<p>who become acquainted through organizational activities influence one another's behav-
</p>
<p>ior (Whiting, 1980) and provide information about matters outside their immediate envi-
</p>
<p>ronments (Jones &amp; Crawford, 1980). 
</p>
<p>Women belong to fewer organizations than men (Booth, 1972). Perhaps more im-
</p>
<p>portantly, however, they belong to much smaller groups and to groups that are organized 
</p>
<p>around social and religious activities rather than work-related activities (McPherson &amp; 
</p>
<p>Smith-Lovin, 1982), The peer interactions created by voluntary organization member-
</p>
<p>ships are, if anything, more gender segregated than the world of work. Nearly one half of 
</p>
<p>the organizations in a study of 10 communities were exclusively female, while one fifth </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>258 Cecilia L. Ridgeway AND Lynn Smith-Lovin 
</p>
<p>were all male (McPherson &amp; Smith-Lovin, 1986). From the point of view of the indi-
vidual, the typical female membership in a voluntary organization generates face-to-face 
interaction with about 29 other members, fewer than four of whom are men. Male mem-
berships, on the other hand, produce contact with over 37 other members (because their 
organizations are larger), eight of whom are women. Men's contacts are both more nu-
merous and more heterogeneous. Business-related and political groups (where men are 
likely to occupy higher status positions than women) are more likely to be gender inte-
grated than social, child-centered, or religious groups. Far from integrating men and 
women, interactions within the voluntary sector tend to lower the diversity of contacts 
(Marsden, 1992; McPherson &amp; Smith-Lovin; 1987). McPherson and Smith-Lovin (1987) 
show that choice of friends within the groups is a relatively unimportant factor; it is the 
opportunity structure created by the groups' composition that leads to most gender segre-
gation. 
</p>
<p>3.1.4. NETWORKS WITHIN WORK ORGANIZATIONS. Although not as segregated as vol-
untary organizations, work settings also create an opportunity structure for interaction 
that differentiates men and women. Women and men historically have worked in differ-
ent occupations; sex segregation is even stronger at the firm level where workers actually 
interact (Baron &amp; Bielby, 1984). Women are found in positions with shorter career lad-
ders, less authority, and less discretionary power (Kanter, 1977; Miller, 1975; South, 
Bonjean, Corder, &amp; Markham, 1982). While they may interact with men in other occupa-
tions (e.g., nurses with doctors or with orderlies, secretaries with managers or with jani-
tors), cross-sex contacts are unlikely to be peer, status-equal interactions. In addition to 
these gender differences in the interaction opportunities created by formal position, women 
are usually less central in informal communication, advice, friendship, and influence 
networks at work (Ibarra, 1989, 1990; Lincoln &amp; Miller, 1979; Miller, Labovitz, &amp; Fry, 
1975). This finding is understandable since women are underrepresented at upper ranks 
in businesses, and rank is correlated with centrality in informal interaction. There is 
substantial evidence, however, that even controlling for rank, women are less well con-
nected in the informal structure. 
</p>
<p>Women in high ranks are more likely to be in a distinct minority and their token 
position puts them under special interactional pressures (Kanter, 1977). Brass (1985) 
argued that, if high-status women are usually gender minorities, they may be less central 
in informal networks simply because they are different. In fact. Brass (1985) found that 
men and women were equally central in informal networks in an organization where 
women were fairly equally represented. These informal networks were quite gender seg-
regated, however, so that the women were central in networks of other women. 
</p>
<p>Ibarra and Smith-Lovin (1997) pointed out the importance of these gender interac-
tion patterns for role modeling and identity maintenance. Women are unlikely to have 
good models of how people like them cope with work challenges, especially at levels 
above their own. They have to reach outside their own work groups to find homophilous 
contacts with other women, while mentor relationships with higher status co-workers are 
likely to be opposite sex. Women are less likely than men to have multiplex, close ties 
with same-sex co-workers or to have gender homophilous relationships with successful 
role models. All of these findings support the general image developed by Kanter (1977) 
and Miller (1986) that women and men find very different interactional environments 
within work organizations, even when they have the same rank or title. 
</p>
<p>To summarize, we find that at all life stages women and men are most likely to have </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Interaction 259 
</p>
<p>status-equal, peer interactions with same-sex others. Cross-sex interactions are most Hkely 
to be embedded in formal, institutional role relationships (such as kinship or work rela-
tionships), which are often also status differentiated. Furthermore, women are more likely 
to occupy the low-status position in these interactions. With this understanding of women's 
and men's networks in hand, we turn to behavior within interactions and within friend-
ship ties. 
</p>
<p>3.2. Bales' Task and Socioemotional Behavior 
</p>
<p>Some of the earliest systematic studies of gender and interaction developed from Bales' 
effort to analyze group dynamics in terms of an instrumental task dimension, consisting 
of behaviors directed toward achieving group goals, and a socioemotional dimension, 
composed of behaviors concerned with solidary relations among the actors (Parsons &amp; 
Bales, 1955; Strodtbeck &amp; Mann, 1956). Perhaps because of this, coding interaction ac-
cording to Bales' (1950, 1970) interaction process analysis (IPA) continues to be a com-
mon way to examine gender differences in behavior. Each speech act is coded in terms of 
who said it, to whom it was directed, and whether it was task oriented (task suggestions, 
information, opinions, and questions asking for these) or socioemotionally oriented (agree-
ing/disagreeing, friendly/unfriendly, jokes or dramatizes). 
</p>
<p>While a usefully broad coding scheme, IPA has two problematic characteristics that 
should be kept in mind in interpreting gender differences based on it. First, acts are 
classified as socioemotional if they contain any socioemotional elements. Thus if a woman 
(or man) accompanies a task suggestion with a smile and laugh, that will be coded as a 
socioemotional, not a task act. Second, results are represented in terms of the proportion 
of a person's acts that are task or socioemotionally oriented which can be misleading. If a 
person speaks up only twice, but each time with a task suggestion, his or her behavior will 
be classified as 100% task oriented. Another, who speaks up ten times, six times with a 
task idea and four times to agree, disagree, or joke, will be classified as only 60% task 
oriented, despite having made three times the task contributions of the first person. 
</p>
<p>IPA studies of task-oriented discussion groups generally show men to have slightly 
(6% to 9%) higher percentages of task behavior and women to have somewhat (5% to 
8%) higher proportions of socioemotional behavior and that these differences are about 
3% larger between men and women in same-sex groups than between men and women in 
mixed-sex groups (Anderson &amp; Blanchard, 1982; Carli, 1989, 1991; Pihavin &amp; Martin, 
1978). These findings are often cited in support of basic gender differences in interac-
tional style, such as those predicted by the two-cultures approach. However, as several 
have pointed out, it is misleading to interpret them this way (Aries, 1996; Carli, 1991; 
Wheelan &amp; Verdi, 1992; Wood &amp; Rhodes, 1992). The problem is that studies examining 
total numbers of task behaviors, instead of relative proportions, find no differences be-
tween men and women in same sex groups (Johnson et al., 1996; Wagner &amp; Berger, 
1997), contrary to the two-cultures prediction. In these task-oriented settings, women as 
well as men are mostly task oriented rather than socioemotional in behavior. When Carli 
(1989) appointed women to the role of persuading others, their percentage of IPA behav-
iors resembled men's, suggesting that their interactional styles are situationally variable. 
</p>
<p>Given that IPA codes an act as socioemotional if it contains any socioemotional 
element, it seems likely that the pattern of gender differences found in IPA studies is due 
to women's greater display of socioemotional cues rather than their lesser propensity to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>260 Cecilia L. Ridgeway AND Lynn Smith-Lovin 
</p>
<p>engage in task behaviors (Carli, 1990; Carli et al., 1995: Dovidio et al., 1988; Hall, 1984; 
Wood &amp; Rhodes, 1992). Johnson et al. (1996) found no gender differences in task behav-
iors in same-sex groups but some differences in expressions of social agreement versus 
counterarguing. Carli (1990) reports greater gender differences in mixed-sex than same-
sex groups for task-oriented aspects of language but larger gender differences in same 
than mixed-sex groups for verbal reinforcers and intensifiers (socioemotional behaviors). 
Gender stereotypic expectations for greater communality and efforts to overcome the le-
gitimacy problems created by their lower gender status (when it is salient) are among the 
explanations offered for women's higher rates of socioemotional behavior in mixed-sex 
task groups. Socioemotional behavior has been neither theorized nor studied with the 
care that task behavior has. We need a better understanding of the way it is affected by 
situational context. 
</p>
<p>3.3. Speech and Gesture Behavior in Interaction 
</p>
<p>While work within the Bales paradigm continued, a new tradition of conversational analysis 
began exploring the structures of women's and men's speech. In summarizing this litera-
ture, we rely heavily on two excellent reviews, by James and Clarke (1988) and by Aries 
(1996). 
</p>
<p>The conversational analysis literature draws heavily on the "two-cultures" perspec-
tive, taking as its point of departure an assumption that, because of their socialization in 
sex-separate peer groups, females and males come to have different conversational goals 
and styles. Much of this literature also has incorporated assumptions about the higher 
status and power of males relative to females, using ideas from the expectation states and 
doing gender perspectives. 
</p>
<p>3.3.1. SUPPORTIVE SPEECH AND BACKCHANNELING. Whether in task groups or in ev-
eryday conversation, women seem to encourage communication and disclosure on the 
part of others. Conversational analysts have concentrated on variables that constitute 
verbal stroking of conversation partners. They found that women are more likely than 
men to express agreement or ask for another's opinion (Eakins &amp; Eakins, 1978; see also 
the Bales literature reviewed previously), to acknowledge points made by the other speaker 
at the beginning of a turn, to provide backchannel support for other speakers by inserting 
small injections such as "mm-hum" to pause to give another the floor, and to use other 
conversational devices that serve to draw out one's conversational partner (McLaughlin 
et al., 1981). Men are more likely to use a delayed minimal response after an interaction 
partner ends an utterance (Zimmerman &amp; West, 1975), which is often interpreted as lack 
of support for the speaker. Other studies showed that cooperative conversations have 
more backchannels and fewer minimal responses than competitive ones, confirming re-
searchers' assumptions about the functions of these speech forms. They also found that 
gender interacted with dominance and power: men showed more backchanneling when 
they were in a subordinate position, while women's supportive speech patterns were less 
affected by their power position (Aries, 1996, pp. 123-126). 
</p>
<p>Other scholars working in this sociolinguistic tradition have highlighted the in-
equality implied by the patterns of men's and women's speech styles. They emphasized 
that women's talk is not only supportive of others, but also unassertive. Robin Lakoff </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Interaction 261 
</p>
<p>(1975), for example, reported that the communication style of women was characterized 
by tentative, unsure, and deferential patterns of speech, while men's conversational style 
was stronger and more direct. Researchers investigating these gender differences in lin-
guistic features found that women are more likely to use questions (especially tag ques-
tions) (Brouwer, Gerritsern, &amp; De Haan, 1979; Crosby &amp; Nyquist, 1977; Eakins &amp; Eakins, 
1978; McMillan, Clifton, McGrath, &amp; Gale, 1977), hedges, quaUfiers, disclaimers, and 
other linguistic forms conveying uncertainty (Bradley, 1981; Carli, 1990; Crosby &amp; 
Nyquist, 1977; Eakins &amp; Eakins, 1978). Women also more frequently use hypercorrect 
grammar, including "superpolite" forms, lengthened requests, and modal constructions 
(Crosby &amp; Nyquist, 1977; Lakoff, 1975; McMillan et al., 1977). Tannen (1990) argued 
that such gendered conversational patterns represent fundamental understandings about 
social interaction that may evoke emotional responses in spite of our intellectual aware-
ness of different conversational codes. Men may respond to women's supportive conver-
sational styles by talking more and dominating the floor; women may respond to men's 
lack of that style by lower participation. (The literature on participation task-oriented 
discussions is reviewed in the section on influence. Time talking in personal conversa-
tions has not been studied as extensively; the fact that men talk more in these non-task 
conversations is implied, however, in the studies of topic control, also reviewed later.) 
</p>
<p>3.3.2. INTERRUPTIONS: FREQUENCY AND FUNCTIONS. A classic paper on turn-taking 
in conversation by Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson (1974) led Zimmerman and West (1975) 
to concentrate on gender differences in interruptions, places where the smooth transfer of 
speakers was disrupted by an apparent violation of turn-taking norms. Zimmerman and 
West (1975) found few interruptions in same-sex conversations, but a high proportion of 
men interrupting women in mixed-sex conversations, leading them to make strong state-
ments about the male dominance of male-female conversation. Other conversational ana-
lytic studies using small numbers of relatively short conversations often confirmed the 
Zimmerman and West finding, but later studies with larger samples of speech and more 
conversations have found few gender effects (see Aries, 1996, pp. 79-101 and James &amp; 
Clark, 1988 for reviews of specific studies). These findings led researchers to reexamine 
the functions of interruptions and the conditions under which they occur. 
</p>
<p>Several patterns emerge from the large body of literature that has developed. First, 
all simultaneous speech is not interruption and not all interruptions are negative. 
Backchannels, as discussed above, represent support for, rather than intrusion into an-
other person's speech. Overlaps at the end of a turn show weaker patterns than breaks 
into the middle of another speaker's utterance and probably represent timing errors rather 
than a true attempt to take the floor. Even structural interruptions (i.e., speech that in-
trudes into another's utterance and prevents him or her from completing it) need not 
always be unsupportive. Many interruptions express agreement, signal a need for more 
information or otherwise express active listenership (Kennedy &amp; Camden, 1983; Murray, 
1985; Sayers &amp; Sherblom, 1987; Smith-Lovin &amp; Brody, 1989; Tannen, 1983). All-female 
groups and supportive, lively conversations can sometimes show high levels of interrup-
tion without being negative. 
</p>
<p>Second, power or dominance typically leads to higher rates of interruptions, espe-
cially successful, negative intrusions into another's speech (Drass, 1986; Kollock, 
Blumstein, &amp; Schwartz; Roger &amp; Nesshoever, 1987; Roger &amp; Schumaker, 1983). Such 
interruptions are more common in conflictual, task-oriented talk and seem to be less </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>262 Cecilia L. Ridgeway AND Lynn Smitli-Lovin 
</p>
<p>common in personal, intimate conversations (Trimboli &amp; Walker, 1984). To the extent 
that men have positions of higher status and power in society, power/dominance effects 
are often interpreted as gender effects. Furthermore, there seems to be a tendency for men 
to respond more strongly to power position than women; here, as in the backchanneling 
research, dominance does not seem to be as closely related to interruption among women 
(Aries, 1982). 
</p>
<p>Third, if there is a gender (as opposed to status/power) effect in interruptions re-
search, it does not seem to be in the frequency with which men and women interrupt, but 
rather in the gender of the person interrupted. Smith-Lovin and Brody (1989) found that 
men discriminated in their interruptions, interrupting women more often than other men, 
while women interrupted men and women at the same rate. Women were also more likely 
to yield the floor to an interrupter than men (see also Smith-Lovin &amp; Robinson, 1992; but 
note that Kennedy and Camden found no gender differences in yielding). Jose, Crosby, 
and Wong-McCarthy (1980) found that women were more likely to be interrupted than 
men in cooperative mixed-sex conversations. In general, men seem to respond more to 
gender of the speaker with whom they are speaking than do women. 
</p>
<p>3.3.3. TOPIC TRANSITIONS IN CONVERSATIONS. Several researchers have shifted their 
attention from interruptions to control of conversational topic. Fishman (1978, 1983) 
coded successful and unsuccessful topic changes among three heterosexual couples over 
12.5 hours of talk. She discovered that men and women raised similar numbers of topics, 
but that men's topics succeeded 96% of the time, while women's succeeded only 36% of 
the time. West and Garcia (1988) and Ainsworth-Vaughn (1992) differentiated between 
collaborative and unilateral/sudden topic shifts, and found that women were particularly 
disadvantaged in losing topics through sudden or unilateral topic changes. However, here 
as in other work on interruptions, there are indications that studies using larger samples 
of speech and more systematic, blind coding methods will find fewer gender effects. 
Okamoto and Smith-Lovin (1996) found no gender effects on the rate of topic introduc-
tion or loss, but a complex pattern of status and group composition effects. 
</p>
<p>3.3.4. GESTURES AND GAZE. In addition to speech structures, several researchers have 
looked at gestures and other nonverbal patterns in interaction. Dovidio et al. (1988), 
Balkwell and Berger (1996), and others have found that dominance displays such as 
gazing while talking, gazing while listening, and frequency of gesturing are structured 
by sex category in a way that indicates a gender status effect. Other gestures such as chin 
thrusts, smiling, and laughing seem to be gendered behaviors that appear across a variety 
of situations, even those that are not linked to status. 
</p>
<p>To summarize, it appears that many of the speech patterns that researchers thought 
were gendered through cultural or socialization processes are actually indicators of status 
or power positions within conversations. Since men are usually higher status than women 
in cross-sex interactions, these status/power structures have often been labeled as gender 
effects. Some patterns, such as backchanneling, smiling, and laughing, however, seem to 
be part of a consistent female interaction pattern that occurs across conversations with 
differing status structures and sex compositions. It also appears that men are somewhat 
more sensitive to their status/power position and to the gender composition of their con-
versation than are women, acting more supportive of other speakers when they are in a 
low-status position but in a more dominant manner when they are in a high-status posi-
tion or interacting with a woman. </p>

</p>
<p>3.4. Influence, Leadership, and Dominance 
</p>
<p>Whether your thoughts and opinions are taken seriously by those with whom you interact, 
whether you are influential in the decisions of groups to which you belong, whether you 
are perceived or accepted as a leader in those groups, and how you act and are reacted to 
in positions of authority are important parts of the way power and inequality in society 
are enacted and sustained across a wide range of social contexts, from work organizations 
to the home. Given the high rate of interaction between men and women, influence and 
inequality in the interactional arena is likely to be a central site for the production and 
maintenance of gender difference and inequality. Not surprisingly, then, a great deal of 
research on gender and interaction has focused on influence, leadership, and dominance. 
In examining this literature, it is important to distinguish between emergent leadership, 
in which people form their own influence hierarchy (e.g., in a committee or among co-
workers), and formal leadership, in which people have been assigned to formally hierar-
chical roles in an organization (e.g., manager and employee). 
</p>
<p>3.4.1. INFLUENCE AND EMERGENT LEADERSHIP. Emergent leadership has been stud-
ied in terms of a complex of behaviors that tend to be highly correlated. Most central are 
influence over group decisions and opinions and being perceived as a leader. These be-
haviors are usually also associated with how much a person participates in the interac-
tion. 
</p>
<p>Studies clearly show that, other things equal, men in mixed-sex groups talk more 
(Dovido et al., 1988; James &amp; Drakich, 1993), are more influential (Lockheed, 1985; 
Wagner et al., 1986; Pugh &amp; Wahrman, 1983), and are more likely to be selected as 
leader than are women (Fleischer &amp; Chertkoff, 1986; Nyquist &amp; Spence, 1986; Wentworth 
&amp; Anderson, 1984). In contrast, in same-sex groups there are no differences between men 
and women in rates of participation and task contributions (Carli, 1991; Johnson et al., 
1996; Wagner &amp; Berger, 1997) or in willingness to accept influence from others (Pugh &amp; 
Wahrman, 1983). 
</p>
<p>In a meta-analysis of 58 studies of leadership emergence in mixed-sex interaction 
(measured by participation or ratings of leadership, but not influence), Eagly and Karau 
(1991) found that men were more likely to emerge as leaders when task leadership was 
assessed (effect size d=Al) and when general or unspecified leadership was measured 
{d=.32 and .29). These are considered moderate effect sizes. In the small percentage of 
studies that assessed leadership in maintaining solidary relationships, women were more 
likely to emerge as social leaders than men (&lt;i=-.18, a small effect size). Eagly and Karau 
interpret these results as supporting the predictions of both social role theory and expec-
tation states theory. 
</p>
<p>As both these theories also predict, Eagly and Karau (1991) found that the gender 
typing of the task affected leadership emergence, as did the length of time participants 
interacted. Men are more likely to emerge as leader on masculine tasks (d=.19, a large 
effect size) than neutral (J=.58) or feminine tasks d-.26). The longer the period of inter-
action, the smaller the effect sizes favoring men. Several studies have found that gender 
differences in leadership emergence disappear or favor women in mixed-sex groups when 
the h task shifts to one that culturally favors the interests, knowledge, and expected com-
petence of women (Dovidio et al., 1988; Wentworth &amp; Anderson, 1984: Yamada, Tjosvold 
&amp; Draguns, 1983).

<p>264 Cecilia L. Ridgeway AND Lynn Smitli-Lovin 
</p>
<p>otherwise equals, the mere knowledge of another's sex, independent of the other's behav-
ior, has been shown to affect willingness to accept influence from that person, demonstrating 
the impact of gender status behefs. Men increase their resistance to the other's influence when 
that other is a woman rather than another man. Women decrease their resistance to influence 
when the other is a man rather than a woman (Pugh &amp; Wahrman, 1983). 
</p>
<p>However, the knowledge of the other's sex in goal-oriented interaction usually also 
affects the verbal and nonverbal confidence and assertiveness of people's behavior, which 
in turn affects how competent and knowledgeable they appear in the setting, as expecta-
tion states theory predicts. Carli (1990), for instance, found that when men and women 
interacted with a same-sex other, there were no gender differences in their use of hedges, 
disclaimers, and other types of tentative language. When men and women interacted with 
an opposite sex other, however, women used significantly more tentative language than 
did men. In a review of eye contact research, Ellyson, Dovidio, and Brown (1992) con-
cluded that men show more visual dominance (which is associated with perceived com-
petence and influence in interaction) than women in mixed-sex interaction, other factors 
equal. In same-sex interaction, however, there are few gender differences in visual domi-
nance, with both men and women displaying similarly higher visual dominance when in 
a high- rather than low-status position in the interaction. 
</p>
<p>Wood and Karten (1986) showed that assumptions about competence mediate men's 
tendency to speak more and engage in more active task behaviors in mixed-sex discus-
sion groups, as expectation states theory argues. Absent more specific information, both 
men and women assumed that the men were more competent, reflecting gender status 
beliefs. When men and women were assigned similar scores on a pretest of task aptitude, 
however, there were no gender differences in participation or task behavior. Instead, high 
scorers spoke more and were more task active than low scorers, regardless of sex. Thus 
assertive task behavior not only gives the impression of competence in interaction, but it 
is itself shaped by prior assumptions about who is more competent in the situation, as-
sumptions that are affected by cultural beliefs about men and women that are salient in 
mixed-sex settings. 
</p>
<p>Studies have shown that counteracting competence information can moderate or 
reverse gender differences in influence in mixed-sex interaction (Pugh &amp; Wahrman, 1983; 
Wagner, et al., 1986). The effect of cultural assumptions that men are more competent 
than women does not just go away, however, it seems to combine with the additional 
competence information in the situation. Thus women must be shown to be more compe-
tent than men to be equally influential with them (Pugh &amp; Wahrman, 1983) and a given 
performance is seen as more indicative of ability in men than women (Foschi, 1996). 
</p>
<p>These studies of influence and emergent leadership demonstrate the impact of hege-
monic cultural stereotypes that paint men as diffusely more competent, status worthy, and 
agentic than women. The participants in these studies are virtually all white and largely 
middle class, so it is not surprising that these are the gender beliefs that would affect their 
behavior. How does gender affect emergent leadership for social groups who may have 
slightly different stereotypic beliefs about men and women? There are few systematic 
studies, but a recent one comparing mixed-sex interaction among African-American and 
white adolescents suggests some general principles. 
</p>
<p>Filardo (1996) reasons that since African-American women have historically en-
gaged in paid work as well as homemaker roles in greater numbers than white women, 
gender stereotypes should be less differentiated among African-Americans than among </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Interaction 265 
</p>
<p>whites. On this basis, Filardo predicts, following social role and expectation states theory, 
that there will be greater gender equality of participation and influence in African-American 
mixed-sex interaction than in such interaction among whites, other factors equal. She 
matched African-American and white eighth graders on socioeconomic status and aca-
demic achievement and assigned them to same race groups of two boys and two girls. 
Among whites, Filardo observed a typical pattern of boys talking more and engaging in 
more influence attempts than girls while girls offered more expressions of agreement 
with others' comments. In African-American adolescent groups, however, there were no 
gender differences in participation or expressions of agreement, and differences in influ-
ence attempts were weaker. These racial differences in interactional equality resulted 
from white girls' lesser participation and more tentative style and African-American 
girls' more active, assertive behavior rather than from differences in the boys' behavior. 
Filardo concludes that white and African-American adolescents may bring to interaction 
differing cultural expectations about the competence of males and females and their re-
spective rights to be assertive and influential. 
</p>
<p>3.4.2. DOMINANCE AND EMERGENT LEADERSHIP. In addition to cultural stereotypes, a 
common assumption is that gender differences in emergent leadership may be due to men 
having personality traits of higher dominance or interest in control over others. Given 
men's higher status and more authoritative roles in society, one might argue that men are 
more likely than women to acquire a personality trait of dominance. A series of studies 
has demonstrated, however, that differences in dispositional dominance do not account 
for men's leadership emergence in mixed-sex interaction (Davis &amp; Gilbert, 1989; Fleischer 
&amp; Chertoff, 1986; Megargee, 1969; Nyquist &amp; Spence, 1986). In same-sex interaction, 
both women and men who are high in dominance are more likely to emerge as leaders 
than low-dominance individuals. However, in mixed-sex interaction, men are usually 
chosen as leaders even when they are low in dominance and the women are high. High-
dominance women often suggested to their low-dominance partner that he take the lead, 
showing the impact of cultural beliefs about who is a more legitimate or competent can-
didate for leadership. Only in the most recent of these studies (Davis &amp; Gilbert, 1989), in 
which subjects had a period of interaction to get to know one another before turning to the 
task, did high-dominance women assume leadership over low-dominance men. They still 
deferred to high-dominance men, however. 
</p>
<p>Even if individual dominance differences do not determine leadership in mixed-sex 
contexts, some argue that they do result in men showing more concern than women for 
hierarchy and power relations in same-sex interaction (see Aries, 1996, pp. 55-60 for a 
review). Others argue that "doing masculinity" in our culture is doing power, especially 
with other men, although exactly how one does power/masculinity varies by race and 
class (Connell, 1995; Messner, 1992). The evidence that men put greater emphasis than 
women on displaying dominance in same-sex interaction is provocative but based on 
small samples or case studies. More systematic studies would be useful. 
</p>
<p>In this light, it is important to note that in task-oriented interaction the display of 
dominance behavior, defined as behavior that conveys control through threat (e.g., com-
mands, a dismissive or aggressive tone, intrusive gestures) is not a good way to become 
influential. It is no more successful in this regard than is submissive behavior, whether 
the participants are all male, all female, or of both sexes (Carii et al., 1995; Ridgeway &amp; 
Diekema, 1989). </p>

</p>
<p>3.4.3. LEGITIMACY, GENDER, AND INFLUENCE. For men in same-sex interaction and 
for women in same-sex interaction, a confident, active, task-oriented style that conveys 
competence gains influence and leadership. Yet this same style can elicit resistance when 
a woman uses it to gain influence over men in mixed-sex task-oriented interaction (Carli, 
1990; Carli et al., 1995; Meeker &amp; Weitzel-O'Neill, 1977; Ridgeway, 1982). Carh et al. 
(1995) found that a woman with a confident, assertive nonverbal style was seen as less 
likeable and was less influential with men than with women or than a man with that style 
was with either men or women. Carli (1990) also found that women who used tentative 
language were actually more influential with a male partner than were women who spoke 
more assertively. These researchers argue, following expectation states theory, that a dis-
play of assertive, high-status behavior by women is perceived by men in the situation as 
illegitimate unless the women also signal that they have no desire to usurp male status. 
Here we see the prescriptive consequences of gender status beliefs. When women accom-
pany their confident, active bids for influence among men with statements of their coop-
erative intent or a friendly nonverbal style they can overcome male resistance and become 
highly influential (Carli et al., 1995; Ridgeway, 1982). Such added "niceness" is not 
required of men to be influential with either men or women (although it does not detract 
from influence) or of women to be influential with women. 
</p>
<p>3.4.4. FORMAL OR ESTABLISHED LEADERSHIP. The evidence clearly indicates that when 
men or women are placed in positions of similar formal authority, there are very few 
differences in the way they interact with either same or opposite sex subordinates (Eagly 
&amp; Johnson, 1990; Johnson 1994). In a meta-analysis of 162 studies, Eagly and Johnson 
(1990) found no differences in how task-oriented male and female leaders are and very 
slight differences in how interpersonally oriented they are (effect size d=.04). The only 
appreciable gender difference was a small tendency {d=.22) for women leaders to be more 
democratic and participatory than men leaders. A subsequent meta-analysis of the evalu-
ation of men and women leaders showed only a very slight overall tendency for women 
leaders to be evaluated less favorably (d=.05) but a moderate tendency (d=.30) for women 
leaders to be evaluated unfavorably when using a directive, autocratic style compared to 
men using this style (Eagly et al., 1992). This suggests again that the prescriptive aspects 
of gender stereotypes create legitimacy problems for women leaders who try to wield 
power in a directive manner. Eagly et al. (1992) suggest that an effort to avoid such negative 
reactions encourages women leaders to be somewhat more democratic in leadership style. 
</p>
<p>3.4.5. CONCLUSIONS. Men are more likely to be influential and emerge as leaders in 
</p>
<p>mixed-sex interaction (at least among whites), especially when the task is a stereotypically 
</p>
<p>masculine one. When the task is stereotypically feminine men's advantage declines and 
</p>
<p>may be reversed with women emerging as leaders. Supporting expectation states and 
</p>
<p>social role theories, these gender differences appear to be caused by cultural stereotypes 
</p>
<p>that ascribe greater general competence, status worthiness, and agency to men than to 
</p>
<p>women rather than basic gender differences in dominance or interaction style. Among 
</p>
<p>subgroups who hold less differentiated gender stereotypes, there is greater gender equal-
</p>
<p>ity in mixed-sex task-oriented interaction. When gender stereotypes are not salient, as in 
</p>
<p>same-sex interaction in which the task is not gender typed, men and women are similar in 
</p>
<p>participation and openness to influence. In general, both men and women gain influence 
</p>
<p>and emerge as leaders with a confident, active style that conveys competence without 
</p>
<p>being domineering. There is a revealing exception, however. To be highly influential </p>

<p>Gender and Interaction 267 
</p>
<p>with men, women must combine this competent, confident style with signals of friendli-
ness and cooperation that assuage the apparent status illegitimacy of their efforts to claim 
leadership. In positions of established or formal leadership, men and women behave similarly. 
</p>
<p>3.5. Friendship Patterns 
</p>
<p>Unlike the family, which is based on cross-sex relationships, or work-oriented interac-
tion, which involves a mix of same-and mixed-sex interaction, friendships in the contem-
porary United States are primarily same-sex ties. Yet friendship interaction, too, is shaped 
by and works to maintain cultural stereotypes of who men and women are and how they 
differ and are unequal. As the gender system and the cultural beliefs associated with it 
have changed over time, so have the nature of men's and women's friendships (Allen, 
1989; Nardi, 1992; O'Connor, 1992). 
</p>
<p>Like all other gendered relations, friendships are situated within and affected by 
people's other identities, ties, and social positions. They change over the life course and 
differ by class and race, creating larger differences within than between genders (Nardi, 
1992; O'Connor, 1992). Unfortunately, many detailed studies of interaction in friend-
ships focus on small samples or on restricted populations, such as college students, war-
ranting caution in generalizing from them. 
</p>
<p>Studies of contemporary same-sex friendships conclude that men's are "side-by-
side" in that they focus on shared activities, while women's friendships are "face-to-face" 
in that they center on talking and sharing feelings (Aries &amp; Johnson, 1983; Caldwell &amp; 
Peplau, 1982; Oliker, 1989; Sherrod, 1987; Swain, 1989; WilUams, 1985; Wright, 1982). 
Researchers often comment on the way these differences enact currently dominant gender 
beliefs that cast intimacy and feeling as feminine while masculinity requires power, self-
sufficiency, and action. Oliker (1989) describes how women "best friends" conduct their 
relationships through talk and disclosure of feelings. Messner (1992) describes how men 
form friendship bonds through sports that unite them in displaying and validating their 
performances of culturally valued images of masculinity while simultaneously support-
ing their superiority over women and less culturally "ideal" men. This process manages 
uneasiness over feelings of closeness that could be seen as threats to masculinity. 
</p>
<p>Several researchers, however, caution against exaggerating the differences between 
the way men and women interact in same-sex friendships, noting that the differences are 
often smaller than assumed (O'Connor, 1992; Walker, 1994; Wright, 1988). Self-disclo-
sure is often seen as a central difference between men's and women's friendships. Yet 
Dindia and Allen (1992), in a meta-analysis of more than 200 studies, found that overall 
gender differences in self-disclosure are small (effect size d=.l8). Gender differences in 
self disclosure in same-sex interaction, however, are of moderate size (d=.3l) while they 
are quite small in mixed-sex relations (rf=.08). The situational variability of self-disclo-
sure suggests that it is not a product of stable personality differences between men and 
women but a reaction to the social context of interaction. Both men and women disclose 
more to women. 
</p>
<p>O'Connor (1992) points out that women's lesser power and control over resources 
compared to men may be partly responsible for differences in their friendships. Without 
money and control over one's time, friendship cannot be conducted by going out and 
doing things together. Such friends are left with conversation, often conducted in a home 
environment that encourages a focus on more personal topics. Supporting this argument. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>268 Cecilia L. Rldgeway AND Lynn Smith-Lovln 
</p>
<p>Walker (1994) reports that the working-class men she interviewed, who, also lacking 
resources, socialized with friends in their homes, tended primarily to talk with their friends, 
often discussing personal relationships. On the other hand, middle-class women who 
worked in male-dominated professions tended to report a lack of intimacy in their friend-
ships similar to that often described in men's friendships. 
</p>
<p>Walker (1994) argues that conceptions of women's friendships as shared feelings 
and men's friendships as shared activities are more accurately viewed as gender ideolo-
gies than as observable differences in actual behavior. Most studies ask people global 
questions about what friendship is or what men's and women's friendship are like (e.g., 
Caldwell &amp; Peplau, 1982). They also tend to focus on best friends (Oliker, 1989). Walker 
asked people to name a set of specific friends and describe what they did with each. She 
found that in response to global questions about friendship, her respondents gave gender-
stereotypic answers. But when asked for details about specific relationships, gender dif-
ferences were few. For instance, a man who listed shared sports events as the basis of a 
given friendship described most interaction with his friend as telephone discussions of 
personal problems and sports outings as only occasional events. A woman who described 
talk and shared feelings as central said that she and her friend regularly went to aerobics 
classes together and that was their occasion to confide. Following a "doing gender" ap-
proach. Walker argues that people interpret their behavior in friendships to conform to 
gender stereotypes when that behavior is in fact considerably more diverse and less gen-
der differentiated. It would be useful to examine the argument Walker develops from in-
depth interviews with data from larger and more representative samples. 
</p>
<p>4. CONCLUSION 
</p>
<p>Interactional events are an important link in the intricate web of social forces that consti-
tutes the gender system. Given the necessarily high rate of interaction between men and 
women, gender difference and inequality would be impossible to maintain if interaction 
were not organized to reinforce it. Several findings from the literature on gender and 
interaction show how this organization occurs. 
</p>
<p>Sex/gender seems to be a fundamental dimension around which interaction is orga-
nized in that people automatically sex categorize others to render them as culturally mean-
ingful interactants. Yet while this makes sex/gender stubbornly available as a basis of 
differentiation in interaction, the direction and size of differences in women's and men's 
behavior in interaction vary dramatically by situational context. 
</p>
<p>No one theory yet provides a complete account of these complex effects. Nonethe-
less, it is clear that widely shared societal stereotypes of (or cultural meanings associated 
with) men and women, which include gender status beliefs, play a central role in shaping 
behavior in interaction. There is a culturally hegemonic version of societal gender be-
liefs, but when people hold subcultural variations on these beliefs, their behavior in inter-
action is also different. 
</p>
<p>Societal gender beliefs appear to shape interactional behavior in at least two poten-
tially independent ways. They act as an identity standard that the individual seeks to 
maintain and they shape others' expectations (and the individual's anticipation of what 
others expect) about the individual's comparative competence, status worthiness, and 
agentic or communal qualities in a manner that has self-fulfilling effects on behavior. 
The impact of societal gender beliefs on behavior through either process depends on the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Interaction 269 
</p>
<p>salience of gender in the situation compared to other social factors and concerns. Gender 
tends to be most salient and, thus, to produce the most differentiation in men's and women's 
behavior in mixed-sex contexts or same-sex contexts that are culturally typed in gendered 
terms, but it can be triggered by events and made salient in almost any situation. When 
salient, the unusually prescriptive aspect of gender stereotypes can result in actors being 
called to account by others for acting in gender-appropriate ways. 
</p>
<p>We may think of these processes as true interactional gender processes. Evidence 
indicates that they are sufficient in themselves to produce many common forms of gender 
difference and inequality. They advantage men in influence, leadership, and the appear-
ance of competence in goal-oriented, mixed-sex interaction: they shape same-sex friend-
ships in stereotypical ways; and so on. But these interactional gender processes usually 
take place within the context of institutional and organizational arrangements that fur-
ther reinforce and shape them. In that sense, the maintenance of gender difference and 
inequality in interaction is overdetermined. 
</p>
<p>The evidence clearly indicates that, although women and men in the United States 
interact frequently, it is almost never as equals and, in most cases, it is men who enjoy the 
status/power advantage. This is a joint result of two processes. First, women's and men's 
networks, which are embedded in the social structures of work and voluntary organiza-
tions, usually bring men and women together on formally unequal terms. Second, inter-
actional gender status and identity processes create difference and inequality among those 
men and women who are formal equals in work groups, family, and elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>This heavily structured pattern of interaction between men and women creates the 
daily appearance of men as essentially more agentic and women as essentially more com-
munal in nature. Yet a closer look at the research reveals what a social construction this 
is. Women and men have diverse repertoires of interactional behavior and are highly 
reactive to situational constraints. Not only are the actual behavioral differences between 
men and women relatively modest, even in gender-salient situations, but when men and 
women are cast in roles with similar constraints, whether it be men who mother or women 
who manage, they behave in remarkably similar ways. 
</p>
<p>We have a good, if imperfect, understanding of the way certain differences in inter-
actional style, often attributed to essential gender differences, in fact result from the orga-
nization of power and status in interactions. As a result of these processes, men and 
women differ in task-oriented, agentic behavior primarily in mixed-sex interactions rather 
than in same-sex ones. Revealingly, the organization of the communal, socioemotional 
aspect of interaction, culturally linked with women, is less well theorized and studied. 
The evidence available, however, suggests that both men and women act more commu-
nally when in a lower-status position. However, women do appear to engage in a some-
what more supportive, warmer speech style in same as well as mixed-sex contexts, sug-
gesting that engaging or failing to engage in such a style is also part of the process of 
marking gender identity in interaction rather than just the enactment of inequality. Per-
haps the clearest lesson from the study of gender and interaction, however, is that differ-
ence and inequality co-determine each other in the gender system.

<p>CHAPTER 14 
</p>
<p>Gender, Violence, 
</p>
<p>and Harassment 
</p>
<p>MARY R. JACKMAN 
</p>
<p>Shame, aversion, and denial suffused the subject of gender and violence and sealed it into 
a long and almost unbroken silence over most of the twentieth century. As late as 1969, a 
major compendium of research on violence prepared for the National Commission on the 
Causes and Prevention of Violence (Graham &amp; Gurr, 1969) made no mention of gender 
and violence: indeed, the only mention of the term "domestic violence" was in a chapter 
title to identify within-nation (as opposed to international) conflict. However, at least 
since the publication of John Stuart Mill's essay on "The Subjection of Women" in 1869, 
there have been sporadic attempts to break the silence, and by the 1970s interest in the 
topic began to intensify; since then an explosion of research and public interest has un-
furled. The primary contributors to research have been sociologists and psychologists of 
gender, but it has also attracted scholars from criminology, family relations, clinical psy-
chology, public health and medicine, political science, and anthropology. 
</p>
<p>Research on gender and violence has been driven by political imperatives emanating 
from both feminists and the conservative right. Paternalistic concern about the propri-
etary protection and control of women's bodies has long goaded conservatives to regard 
illegitimate physical and sexual attacks on women as particularly heinous crimes. Since 
the 1960s, feminists have refueled public concern about physical and sexual assaults on 
women, but their stance rests on women's right to autonomous control over their bodies. 
These seemingly incompatible political agendas have jointly fixed on the woman's body 
as the object of concern, spawning voluminous research on violence against women. 
Broader questions have usually been bypassed about the ways in which gender has condi-
tioned the practice of violence by and against women and men.

</p>
<p>Analysts have focused on specific acts of violence against women that have fallen 
under the policy spotlight. Large, specialized bodies of research have developed on do-
mestic violence against women and on rape and sexual abuse. In the wake of women's 
reentry to the workplace, a growing literature on the sexual harassment of women has 
also emerged. More recently, some scholars have focused attention on a new concept 
called femicide, "the misogynist killing of women by men" (Radford &amp; Russell, 1992, p. 
3), and a literature has begun to develop on the selective abortion of female fetuses, 
infanticide of female babies, and neglect of female children and women in many cultures. 
There has also been a growing concern among journalists, activists, and scholars with 
female genital mutilation, practiced primarily in some African cultures. With the partial 
exception of work on femicide, which sometimes draws on research on other types of 
violence against women, research has evolved in discrete bundles of inquiry largely dis-
connected from each other, let alone violence against men. The result is a patchwork of 
information about specific forms of violence against women, with no overarching con-
ceptual framework within which to interpret those acts, link them to each other, or situate 
them in a broader array of gendered behaviors that produce differential experiences of 
violence among women and men. 
</p>
<p>The balkanized, social-problems orientation of research on gender and violence has 
been endemic to research on other types of violence as well. Spurred by a sense of social 
urgency and the electricity of the subject matter, analysts of violence have generally short-
circuited conceptual issues and proceeded directly to the analysis of specific forms of 
violence that have caught their attention. Thus, the wider literature on violence has been 
unable to provide a conceptual toolkit that could be applied to the unfurling concern with 
the relationship between gender and violence. In the absence of a clear, explicit concep-
tion of violence, implicit assumptions about the nature of the phenomenon have shaped 
the research agenda, working like a hidden hand to constrain research on gender and 
violence. Perhaps the two most prevalent assumptions are that violent behaviors are mo-
tivated by a hostile intent to harm the victim and that such behaviors lie outside the 
bounds of normal social intercourse, that is, that violence is malevolently motivated and 
socially, morally, or legally deviant from the mainstream. It is also commonly assumed 
that violence involves the use of force, that is, that the victim is an unwilling recipient of 
injuries. These three assumptions are so intrinsic to most conceptions of violence that 
they are rarely stated explicitly. In addition, most analysts focus on interpersonal vio-
lence, bypassing both self-inflicted violence and violence in which either the agents or 
the victims are corporate. Finally, most scholars have granted primacy to physical behav-
iors and injuries (or the threat thereof), with less significance generally attached to inju-
rious behaviors that are verbal or written or to injuries that are psychological, social, or 
material. 
</p>
<p>The types of gender violence that have been the main object of inquiry are in accord 
with these assumptions. First, analysts of gender and violence have focused almost exclu-
sively on interpersonal violence, while corporate behaviors have been only slightly exam-
ined to ascertain violent outcomes by gender. Second, the primary focus has been on the 
infliction or threat of physical injuries, although there has been increasing recognition of 
the psychological injuries suffered by victims of domestic violence, rape and sexual as-
sault, sexual harassment, and genital mutilation. Third, analysts have attended primarily 
to physical behaviors, although some have argued that verbal abuse, verbal harassment, 
and pornographic materials contribute significantly to patterns of violence against women. 
Fourth, like other scholars of violence, analysts of gender violence assume that violence </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 277 
</p>
<p>is motivated by ill will and the intent to harm. This assumption, combined with the 
almost exclusive focus on violence against women, has fostered the argument that social 
relations are fundamentally misogynist and that women live in a hostile and assaultive 
world. Fifth, driven by the assumption that violence involves the use of force on unwill-
ing victims, analysts have taken an intense interest in the issue of victim complicity in 
domestic and sexual violence. Finally, the overriding assumption that violence represents 
a deviant course of behavior has encouraged students of gender violence to conclude that 
gender relations are uniquely violent, further encouraging the view that misogyny is the 
key to understanding gender relations and gender violence. 
</p>
<p>In sum, research on gender and violence has focused overwhelmingly on interper-
sonal, physical behaviors in which men inflict physical and psychological injuries on 
women. The extent to which women share complicity in the violence that they endure is 
a contentious issue to which much significance is attached. The exclusive focus of most 
analysts on violence against women, combined with underlying preconceptions about the 
nature of violence, has fostered the view that gender relations are driven by misogyny. 
This is reflected in the appearance of popular books with titles such as The War Against 
Women (French, 1992) and Femicide: The Politics of Woman Killing (Radford &amp; Russell, 
1992). The overwhelming image that emerges is of men as the hostile and abusive domi-
nant class and women as the beleaguered and victimized subordinates. 
</p>
<p>My purpose in this chapter is to make a broad assessment of the relationship be-
tween gender and violence. In keeping with the nucleus of research, I focus primarily on 
violence against women, but I expand the scope to include violence against men. Detailed 
reviews are available elsewhere of specific forms of violence against women (e.g., Marshall, 
Laws, &amp; Barbaree, 1990; Ohlin &amp; Tonry, 1989; Reiss &amp; Roth, 1993, 1994; Ruback &amp; 
Weiner, 1995). I begin by appraising the daunting problems of observation and measure-
ment that plague research and the main sources of available data. Second, I survey re-
search on the broad variety of violent behaviors found in social life, to assess the preva-
lence and severity of various forms of violence against women as well as men. What are 
the main forms of violence to which women and men are vulnerable, and to what extent 
does each gender participate in the practice of violence? Third, I discuss the issue of 
cultural and legal support for violence against women and men. Does society distinc-
tively encourage men to assault and abuse women, as some analysts have alleged? Fourth, 
I examine the contentious issue of victim compliance in incidents of gender violence: are 
women liable for their own victimization? Finally, I address the theoretical explanation 
of the relationship between gender and violence. After briefly discussing the leading 
explanations of violence against women, I propose an alternative approach based on a 
wider scan of violence in both women's and men's lives. 
</p>
<p>My discussion throughout is guided by a broad definition of violence as physical, 
verbal, or written actions that inflict, threaten, or cause bodily, psychological, social, 
</p>
<p>or material injury (Jackman, in preparation). Note that this definition includes all in-
jurious actions, regardless of their legality or their popular ideological construction. Vio-
lent actions may be committed against either others or oneself; be endured unwillingly or 
willingly; involve individual or corporate agents and/or victims; be intentional or negli-
gent; be motivated by hostility, benevolence, masochism, or indifference for the victim; 
or be committed as an end in themselves or in the service of other objectives. What 
analysts have not acknowledged is that humans appear to have a capacity for violence&mdash; 
as perpetrators, victims, and observers&mdash;that is remarkably elastic. People do not have to 
be filled with hatred or anger to commit violence against others or with despair to inflict </p>
<p/>

<p>278 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>it on themselves. The motivations for and the social sanctioning of injurious actions vary 
widely. 
</p>
<p>Because the material and social injuries associated with gender relations are the 
subject of several other chapters in this volume, this chapter is restricted to those actions 
that produce bodily or psychological injuries. But even with this restriction, my defini-
tion of violence brings a broad array of injurious behaviors within view. In addition to 
those forms of gender violence that have been the subject of intense research (rape, do-
mestic violence, and sexual harassment), it also includes a variety of behaviors that have 
usually been kept discrete from discussions of gender violence: painful or hazardous 
beauty practices, sexual mutilation, suicide, infanticide and progenicide, the use of de-
meaning or coercive images in pornographic materials, the infliction of working condi-
tions that are hazardous or debilitating, the marketing of consumer products that put 
people at risk, the dispatch of young adults (usually males) into the jaws of death and 
mutilation in the military defense of their country, and other state-mandated violence in 
the form of punishments for behaviors defined as crimes. All of these actions involve the 
infliction of significant bodily and/or psychological harm, although they vary on many of 
the dimensions outlined previously. My purpose is to explore how gender affects involve-
ment (both as victims and perpetrators) in the many faces of violence. The pertinent 
question for this chapter is not how and why there is violence against women, but instead, 
how the social organization of gender shapes the practice of violence against women and 
men. 
</p>
<p>1. PROBLEMS OF OBSERVATION AND MEASUREMENT 
</p>
<p>Because the social organization of gender routinely places women in institutional set-
tings that are shielded from public view, direct observation of gender violence is difficult, 
if not impossible. Intimate contact between men and women has been privatized within 
the institution of the family, while sexual relations and sexuality range from privatized to 
taboo. Even as women have entered the more public sphere of the workplace, they con-
tinue to be thrown into one-on-one contacts with their male superiors or co-workers that 
are shielded from public view. Further, complex social norms that both stigmatize and 
deny incidents of rape, domestic violence, and sexual harassment make the disclosure of 
victimization personally costly, thus further reducing the accessibility of information about 
these forms of violence. When lower-status victims (and women are lower status by virtue 
of their gender and often according to other status positions as well) report on incidents 
that are unwitnessed by others, they frequently find they are granted less credibility than 
the higher-status perpetrator, with the result that the incident may be either denied or 
reinterpreted by others to place the blame on the victim herself. Even if they could be sure 
of successful prosecution, victims of rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, and sexual 
harassment may feel sufficiently defiled or shamed by the event to shrink from disclosure. 
In addition, sexual practices that are harmful to women, such as female genital mutila-
tion, are enshrouded in taboos that obstruct their direct observation. In the face of such 
pronounced difficulties in accessing information, debates (often emotionally charged) 
have persisted on the incidence and seriousness of violence against women (see, e.g., 
Satel, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Most research on violence against women has been conducted in the United States, 
Canada, or Great Britain, with relatively little work in other countries and even less </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 279 
</p>
<p>cross-national or cross-cultural research. The primary sources of data on domestic and 
sexual violence against women have been criminal justice statistics, victimization and 
self-report surveys, studies based on specialized samples of students, clinical or social-
service clients, and medical records. In the United States, the most widely cited data 
sources are: (1) the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), compiled annually from offi-
cial police reports of eight index crimes; (2) the National Crime Survey (NCS), a na-
tional, probability, victimization survey administered every 6 months by the Bureau of 
the Census and the Department of Justice; and (3) the National Family Violence Surveys 
(NFVS) (Gelles &amp; Straus, 1988; Straus &amp; Gelles, 1990a; Straus, Gelles, &amp; Steinmetz, 
1980), which contain personal interviews with a national probability sample of 2143 
individuals from intact families in 1975, and telephone interviews with a national prob-
ability sample of 6002 individual family members (including single-parent families) in 
1985. Cross-national and cross-cultural data sources include the United Nations, 
INTERPOL, and the World Health Organization data sets, compiled from the official 
crime or mortality statistics of many nations; an International Crime Survey (ICS), mod-
eled on the NCS, fielded in 1989 in 14 countries; the Conflict Tactics Scale developed in 
the NFVS, fielded in a number of countries; some multination surveys of perceptions of 
deviance or violence; and the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF). Excellent overviews 
of the features and problems of cross-national and cross-cultural data on violence can be 
found in Daly and Wilson (1988), Ember and Ember (1995), and Gartner (1995). Studies 
of sexual harassment have relied primarily on victimization surveys of workers or stu-
dents. Perhaps the most complete data are from large, probability, mail surveys of United 
States Federal workers conducted by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (U.S. MSPB), 
by mandate of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978: these surveys were conducted in 
1980, 1987, and 1994 (U.S. MSPB, 1981, 1995); sample sizes range from almost 20,000 
in 1980 to about 8000 in 1987. Studies of feminine beauty practices and female genital 
mutilation have been primarily ethnographic (based on direct observation and informant 
reports), sometimes supplemented by small surveys. 
</p>
<p>These highly varied data sources have been associated with different kinds of prob-
lems. Criminal justice data underrepresent all crimes, but assaults and rapes are espe-
cially likely to be underreported, and this bias becomes stronger when victims and of-
fenders know each other (Weis, 1989)&mdash;precisely the kinds of violence in which women 
are most likely to be victims. In addition, official records (such as the UCR) contain only 
minimal information about victim and offender characteristics: for example, the UCR 
reports detailed information on the relationship between the victim and the offender for 
homicides only, making it impossible to use these data to examine spousal assaults, and 
the UCR contains no information on the socioeconomic standing, education, or income of 
the victim or the offender for any index crime. These problems are compounded in cross-
national analyses or trend studies that depend on direct comparison of criminal justice 
data that have been recorded according to varying rules and biases and that employ vary-
ing definitions of nonlethal violence. For these reasons, use of official statistics to analyze 
cross-national variance in violence is widely regarded as untenable except for some lim-
ited analyses of homicide (Gartner, 1995). The HRAF, compiled from ethnographic ac-
counts of diverse cultures, are even more subject to inconsistencies in recording rules 
across ethnographers and cultures for various forms of violence. 
</p>
<p>Data from national probability surveys of victimization or self-reported violent be-
haviors (such as the NCS or the NFVS) provide higher estimates of violence against 
women than official crime statistics, since they do not depend on incidents finding their </p>
<p/>

<p>280 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>way into the criminal justice system. They also permit more ambitious analyses because 
they include more information about victims and offenders. However, these data are also 
subject to underreporting, owing to the sensitivity of the topic and the stigma attached to 
both perpetrator and victim in family and sexual violence. The impersonal, shotgun ap-
proach of survey interviews is ill suited to elicit the disclosure of such sensitive material, 
and, to make matters worse, in some cases the victim may be answering questions in the 
presence of either the perpetrator or children. All these factors are exacerbated in tele-
phone interviews, which were used in the second NFVS in 1985. The NFVS probably 
offers the best source of systematic, detailed data on family violence, but this study has 
been severely criticized by some for gathering information on violent behaviors for the 
Conflict Tactics Scale without placing those behaviors in their social context (see, e.g.. 
Brush, 1993; Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1979, 1983; Kurz, 1993; Straus &amp; Gelles, 1990a). The 
reality is that violence between intimates is usually made up of complex, interactive events 
that are lodged in ongoing interpersonal relationships that are emotionally saturated: it is 
a tall order to observe and measure such events with an instrument as blunt and superfi-
cial as a public-opinion survey, and yet there is no other way to gain systematic informa-
tion for a cross-section of the population. 
</p>
<p>Other measurement issues plague the analysis of violence against women. Analysts 
have disagreed about how important it is to develop measures that are consistent with 
legal definitions of violent behaviors. The overriding interest in informing public policy 
has driven researchers to attend to the specific legal definition of crimes, but such defini-
tions are often overly restrictive and have themselves changed over time. These problems 
have been especially salient in the analysis of rape and sexual assault. The traditional 
legal definition of forcible rape in the United States excluded many forms of coercive sex, 
such as forced sex in which there is a male victim, nonvaginal sex, and marital rape 
(Koss, 1992; Russell, 1982; Von, Kilpatrick, Burgess, &amp; Hartman, 1991); rape statutes 
have been reformed in a number of states to broaden definitions along various dimen-
sions, but jurors (and victims themselves) often have difficulty recognizing coercive sex 
between marital partners or other intimates or friends or become confused in trying to 
codify some sexually coercive behaviors. Scholars have responded to these inherent diffi-
culties in a variety of ways, ranging from staying within legal definitions (e.g., Russell, 
1982) to developing measures that depict coercion as a continuum that extends in a series 
of gradations from consensual sex to forcible rape (Bart &amp; O'Brien, 1985; Kelly, 1987). 
Again, cross-national data sets of self-report surveys compound these problems by the 
introduction of noncomparability across nations in cultural and legal definitions of vio-
lence, question wording, and samples (Gartner, 1995). 
</p>
<p>The main alternatives to systematic data sets have been observational studies or in-
depth interviews relying on small, nonrepresentative, purposive, or convenience samples 
of official offenders, social-service clients, or patients in health facilities (e.g., Dobash &amp; 
Dobash, 1979; Stark, Flitcraft, &amp; Frazier, 1979; Walker, 1979). These studies often per-
mit greater analytic depth and sensitivity, and investigators may find subjects more will-
ing to disclose and discuss incidents of violence in their lives because, either through 
their own actions or someone else's, some kind of public acknowledgment of the violence 
has already taken place. However, such data may also be highly misleading: sampling on 
the dependent variable creates serious selection bias, resulting in overestimates of the 
incidence of violence and possibly atypical observations of the associated causal factors 
(Hirschi &amp; Selvin, 1967; Weis, 1989). A number of studies have also made use of student 
samples: although often convenient, these are susceptible to overestimates of the inci-</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 281 
</p>
<p>dence of and normative support for gender-related violence because the young are both 
more sexually active and more violence prone (Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988; Laumann, Gagnon, 
Michael, &amp; Michaels, 1994, pp. 98, 336-337; Reiss &amp; Roth, 1993, pp. 72-74; Wolfgang, 
1967a, b). 
</p>
<p>Research on other forms of gender-related violence, such as corporate violence against 
women and ethnic customs or fashion dictates that result in female bodily alteration, have 
not usually been studied systematically. There have been some case studies of specific 
instances of corporate violence against women (e.g., see Finley, 1996, on the marketing 
of the Dalkon Shield lUD despite evidence that it was hazardous), and ethnographic 
observations of culturally mandated beauty practices, supplemented by interviews with 
medical practitioners or other knowledgeable informants (e.g.. El Dareer, 1982; Lightfoot-
Klein, 1989). Ethnographic research has been invaluable in exposing female genital 
mutilation, but it requires a major personal investment for analysts to obtain sufficient 
access to gain reliable and valid information about the extent of the practice and norma-
tive support for it (Lightfoot-Klein, 1989). Further, the focus in both case-study and eth-
nographic research on gender and violence has been overwhelmingly on female victim-
ization, providing no information on the violence victimization of women relative to men 
in corporate and cultural settings. 
</p>
<p>2. GENDER AND THE PRACTICE OF VIOLENCE 
</p>
<p>The exact incidence of violence between males and females is unknown, but there is 
widespread agreement that in such interactions it is women who are more likely to suffer 
injuries. However, when one casts a broader net across all social relations, the relative 
victimization of women recedes and it is men who appear more vulnerable. Overall, men 
are both the main perpetrators and the main victims of physical violence, but women 
appear to be more at risk of victimization in relations involving intimate, private, or 
sexual interactions with men. Clearly, the woman's body is contested terrain, with many 
parties having a strong interest in controlling it. On this pivots both the protection of 
women from some forms of violence and their disproportionate victimization from oth-
ers. In addition, women themselves do not abstain entirely from committing violence. In 
this section, I review men's and women's relative involvement in various forms of physi-
cal violence. 
</p>
<p>2.1. Homicide 
</p>
<p>Because data for homicide are more complete and accurate than for assault, some schol-
</p>
<p>ars have chosen to analyze spousal homicide as a way of addressing the issue of intimate, 
</p>
<p>gender-related violence (e.g., Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988; Mercy &amp; Saltzman, 1989; Wilson &amp; 
</p>
<p>Daly, 1992a, b; Wilson, Daly, &amp; Scheib, 1997; Wilson, Daly, &amp; Wright, 1993; Wilson, 
</p>
<p>Johnson, &amp; Daly, 1995). Spousal homicides are rare, relative to the incidence of spousal 
</p>
<p>assault, but because they are often associated with a prior history of spousal assault, their 
</p>
<p>etiology is assumed to be parallel (Wilson, Daly, &amp; Wright, 1993). Overwhelmingly, 
</p>
<p>women are the victims of spousal homicide: scattered data from Australia, Canada, Den-
</p>
<p>mark, England and Wales, Scotland, Africa, and India suggest that for every 100 spousal 
</p>
<p>homicides perpetrated by husbands, only between 0 (India) and 40 (Scotland) are perpe-</p>

<p>trated by wives (Wilson &amp; Daly, 1992b). In the United States, there is a sharp (and unex-
plained) distinction between whites and African-Americans in the relative victimization 
of wives and husbands from spousal homicides. For the years 1976-1985, among white 
Americans, wives' rate of spousal homicide victimization was 1.3 per 100,000 while for 
husbands it was 0.7; among African-Americans, the victimization rate was 7.1 for wives 
and 9.7 for husbands (Mercy &amp; Saltzman, 1989). These rates for African-Americans are 
not only dramatically higher than for whites, but they also follow an entirely different 
pattern than for American whites, other minorities, or blacks in other nations, with Afri-
can American wives showing a uniquely high rate of husband murder (Bohannan, 1967; 
Kruttschnitt, 1995; Mushanga, 1978; Wilson &amp; Daly, 1992b). Since wives who murder 
their spouses are much more likely than their male counterparts to have been provoked to 
murder after suffering abuse and assault from their eventual victims (Browne, 1987; Daly 
&amp; Wilson, 1988; Pagan &amp; Browne, 1994; Jones, 1980; Langan &amp; Dawson, 1995; Pleck, 
1987, pp. 222-223; Totman, 1978; Wolfgang, 1967b, c), it would be useful to compare 
patterns and dynamics of domestic violence among black and white couples as well as the 
availability of police and social welfare interventions for battered wives in black and 
white communities. 
</p>
<p>Data for the United States over the past two decades (1977-1995) indicate that the 
rate of spousal homicide victimization has dropped precipitously for husbands (from 1.5 
to 0.5 per 100,000) but has only inched down for wives (from 1.6 to 1.3) (Craven, 1996). 
Although the causes of this are unknown, it is possible that the increase in police and 
welfare interventions over this period have given battered wives more avenues of escape, 
thus saving men's lives, even if not women's. Systematic evidence from earlier historical 
periods is not available, but several factors have encouraged some scholars to presume 
that wife assault and murder were more frequent in the past: the existence of legal stat-
utes permitting wife beating or murder under designated circumstances, the greatly di-
minished legal status of wives relative to husbands until relatively recent times (Dobash 
&amp; Dobash, 1979; Fagan &amp; Browne, 1994; French, 1992; May, 1978), and the generally 
higher rates of physical violence in earlier historical periods (Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988, p. 
291; Gurr, 1981; Manchester, 1992; Stone, 1983). However, Stone's (1983) analysis of 
fragmentary homicide data for England from 1200 to the present suggests that, although 
the overall homicide rate declined dramatically, the percentage of homicides involving 
family members has increased steadily, from about 8% in the fourteenth century to about 
50% in present-day England. Pleck (1987, pp. 217-225) suggests that the family homi-
cide rate in medieval England was fairly similar to recent rates in England and America, 
with a somewhat lower rate in the early modern period, and that the percentage of family 
homicides involving spouses generally decreased from medieval to Elizabethan times 
and then began to increase again in the Victorian era to the present-day level of about one 
half of all family murders. This suggests that wives' risk of being murdered by their 
husbands was fairly similar in the medieval era to what it is today in England and the 
United States, although women enjoyed somewhat lower risk during the Elizabethan era. 
Relative constancy in women's rates of homicide victimization is also suggested by analyses 
of homicide data for varying time periods from the 1870s to the 1980s for 16 nations in 
different parts of the globe, with rates for men both higher and more prone to fluctuation 
over time (Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988, pp. 284-286; Verrko, 1967). 
</p>
<p>In earlier historical periods in which women lacked legal rights, a number of social 
constraints probably worked informally to limit the amount of physical abuse and murder </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 283 
</p>
<p>that husbands could perpetrate against their wives: the lack of privacy from extended 
family members and other villagers in close-knit, densely housed village communities, 
the restricted geographic mobility of most common people (so that your reputation stuck 
to you), the wife's economic value as a contributing member of the household economy, 
and the difficulty an abusive husband might have in replacing a murdered wife in a 
community where everyone knows everything about you. These kinds of factors have not 
been discussed by feminist scholars addressing the history of wife abuse, who have in-
stead stressed evidence suggesting the legal legitimacy of wife beating in times past. 
</p>
<p>In the past decade in the United States, spousal homicides have constituted some-
what over one half of homicides involving nuclear-family members, but only about 5% to 
8% of all homicides (FBI Uniform Crime Reports, 1986-1995). Once one goes beyond 
intimate partner relations, it is men who are at greater risk of homicide victimization, 
even within the family (Reiss &amp; Roth, 1993, p. 234). Thus, for 1995 in the United States, 
women were the victims in almost three quarters of the spousal homicides, but men were 
the victims in about 60% of the nonspousal nuclear-family homicides (those between 
parents and children or between siblings) (FBI UCR, 1995). Outside the family, men are 
overwhelmingly the victims (and the perpetrators) of homicide: in nonfamily homicides 
in the United States in 1988, men constituted 82% of the victims and 93% of the perpe-
trators (Dawson &amp; Langan, 1994; see also Kruttschnitt, 1995). Thus, women are more at 
risk of being murdered by their spouses, while men are more at risk of being murdered by 
other family members and even more so by friends, associates, and strangers. Women are 
much less likely to perpetrate homicide than men, committing only about 10% of all 
homicides in the United States, Canada, the British Isles, and Australia (Dawson &amp; Langan, 
1994; Kruttschnitt, 1995), but most female-perpetrated homicides take place within the 
family, primarily with spouses or children as the victims. In the United States in 1988, 
women perpetrated about one third of family homicides and over one half of the murders 
of offspring (Dawson &amp; Langan, 1994; see also Reiss &amp; Roth, 1994, p. 234). Since spou-
sal and other family homicides constitute only a small minority of all homicides in the 
United States, homicide is primarily a male affair, but the institution of the family puts 
women at risk of victimization and also provokes some women to murderous behaviors 
that they do not exhibit outside the family. 
</p>
<p>2.2. Suicide 
</p>
<p>Relatively little research has been done on the relationship between gender and suicide, 
but it is the ninth leading cause of death in the Unites States, exceeding the number of 
homicides every year since 1981 (Kachur, Potter, James, &amp; Powell, 1995). More than 
30,000 Americans took their own lives in 1992 (Kachur et al., 1995), compared with 
about 22,500 homicides (FBI UCR, 1993). As with violence directed at others, males are 
the main perpetrators. The age-adjusted suicide rate for white males in the United States 
in 1992 was 19.4 per 100,000, about four times higher than the rate of 4.6 for white 
females. African-American males have a lower suicide rate than white males (12.3 per 
100,000), but still six times higher than the suicide rate of 2.0 for African-American 
females (Kachur et al., 1995). These differences in suicide rates by gender and race in the 
United States have been remarkably stable over the course of the twentieth century 
(Holinger, 1987). </p>

<p>2.3. Assault 
</p>
<p>Because of the daunting difficulties that beset the observation and measurement of do-
mestic violence and the unknown degree of reporting bias for various forms of assault, 
researchers have yet to generate confident estimates of the relative incidence of domestic 
assault for men and women. Estimates of the relative perpetration by and victimization of 
men and women vary widely, according to the methods of observation and measurement, 
type of sample, and political agenda of the analyst. Most analyses of gender and assault 
focus on only one element of the problem, most often wife abuse and assault, making it 
difficult to address broader issues about the way in which gender conditions the likeli-
hood of committing or suffering assault over the gamut of life situations. 
</p>
<p>Overall, as with homicide, men are the main perpetrators and victims of assault 
(Reiss &amp; Roth, 1993, pp. 69, 74), but women's victimization increases sharply in family 
and sexual relationships (Bachman &amp; Saltzman, 1995; Browne, 1993; Pagan &amp; Browne, 
1994; Kruttschnitt, 1994; Reiss &amp; Roth, 1993, 1994). Data from the NCS for 1992-1993 
indicate that assaults by intimates (that is, spouses, ex-spouses, or ex- or current boy/ 
girlfriends) account for only a tiny fraction of all male victimizations from simple and 
aggravated assault (3% and 5%, respectively), whereas almost one third of the female 
victims of both kinds of assault have been assaulted by intimates (Bachman &amp; Saltzman, 
1995). Men are about three times more likely than women to become victims of simple or 
aggravated assault from a stranger, but victimization by intimates is over seven times 
more likely for women for simple assault and about three times more likely for aggra-
vated assault (Bachman &amp; Saltzman, 1995). Further, women's intimate victimizations 
are more likely to be repeated and to become chronic (Browne, 1993; Frieze &amp; Browne, 
1989; Langan &amp; Innes, 1986). 
</p>
<p>The injuries experienced by battered wives have been the subject of considerable 
research. A recent study of patients visiting 24-hour emergency rooms at a nationwide, 
American sample of 31 hospitals estimates that in 1994 at least 200,000 women required 
emergency medical attention for injuries inflicted by intimates, compared with about 
39,000 men (Rand &amp; Strom, 1997, p. 5; Satel, 1997). Female victims are most likely to 
sustain injuries in the face or breasts, unless they are pregnant, in which case they are 
more likely to be struck in the abdomen (Schroedel &amp; Peretz, 1994, p. 344). Pregnant 
victims not only sustain physical injuries to themselves but also have higher rates of 
miscarriage, stillbirths, and low birthweight babies, and there has been some documenta-
tion of direct injuries to the baby in utero (Schroedel &amp; Peretz, 1994, pp. 345-346). 
Analysts of partner assaults have also taken the lead in highlighting the often chronic 
psychological injuries that affect victims: anxiety, depression, attempted suicide, alcohol-
ism, low self-esteem, sense of violation, and the inability to function independently (see, 
e.g., Browne, 1993; Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1979; Frieze &amp; Browne, 1989; Reiss &amp; Roth, 
1993, pp. 237-239; Stark &amp; Flitcraft, 1988, 1991; Tolman, 1989; Walker, 1979). The 
medicalized concept, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (or PTSD), which was originally 
developed to denote a range of negative psychological symptoms resulting from trau-
matic events such as wars, concentration camps, and airplane hijackings, has now been 
applied to the victims of partner abuse (see, e.g., Astin, Lawrence, &amp; Foy, 1993; Browne, 
1993; Frieze &amp; Browne, 1989, p. 196). 
</p>
<p>Exact estimates of spousal assault in the United States vary dramatically, depending 
on the type of sample and methodology employed. The most commonly cited estimate 
comes from the National Family Violence Surveys from the 1970s and 1980s: responses </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 285 
</p>
<p>to items in the Conflict Tactics Scale suggest that at least 1.8 million women (or 34 out of 
every 1000 wives) are assaulted by male partners each year in the United States (Browne, 
1993; Frieze &amp; Browne, 1989; Straus &amp; Gelles, 1990b; Straus, Gelles, &amp; Steinmetz, 1980). 
This estimate is substantially higher than those obtained from the NCS, but it is nonetheless 
widely assumed that it is still an underestimate. Quite apart from the probable 
underreporting of spousal assaults, the NFVS samples did not include divorced couples 
or nonfamilial intimate relationships such as boy/girlfriends, and women in both of these 
categories are known to experience higher assault victimization from their ex- or current 
partners than do married women who cohabit with their husbands (Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988, 
p. 219; Pagan &amp; Browne, 1994, p. 155-156; Stark, Flitcraft, &amp; Frazier, 1979). If one could 
correct for these factors, the incidence of partner assault of women could be twice as high 
(Browne, 1993). As with other forms of interpersonal, physical violence, spousal assault is 
inversely related to age (see, e.g., Straus &amp; Gelles, 1990a). Data from the NFVS also indi-
cate that wife battering is two or three times as common among African-Americans as among 
white Americans (Stark &amp; Flitcraft, 1991; Straus et al., 1980), but as with racial differences in 
spousal homicide, this difference has not been explained; studies consistently show only a 
small inverse relation between income and spousal assault (Stark &amp; Flitcraft, 1991). 
</p>
<p>A more controversial claim from the NFVS has been that women use physically 
violent behaviors against their spouses at least as much as do men (Steinmetz, 1977-
1978; Straus &amp; Gelles, 1990b). This claim has sparked substantial criticism, and a num-
ber of studies have pointed to factors that appear to undermine its veracity, most notably, 
that men's assaultive behaviors are more frequent and severe and result in more serious 
injuries (see, e.g.. Berk, Berk, Loseke, &amp; Rauma, 1983; Browne, 1993; Brush, 1993; 
Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1979, 1983; Fagan &amp; Browne, 1994, pp. 169-171; Kurz, 1993; Stark 
&amp; Flitcraft, 1991). Similar male-female patterns of violence (that is, reciprocity of vio-
lence but male dominance in severe violence) have been reported for dating couples 
(Sugarman &amp; Hotaling, 1989, pp. 8-11). In-depth interviews with chronically abused 
women in Scottish shelters (Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1979) indicated that such women had 
learned not to attempt resistance when their husbands were assaultive as that only re-
sulted in more serious injuries (see also Pagelow, 1984, pp. 316-319). However, in the 
general population (which would include many relatively minor incidents), there may be 
a higher incidence of mutual combat between marital partners, even though women (usu-
ally the weaker of the two parties) are more likely to come out the losers from such 
encounters. There is also some evidence that women are strategic in their use of marital 
violence. Jones (1980, pp. 286-295) reports that in many cases of lethal retaliation against 
chronically abusive husbands, women wait until their husbands have temporarily dis-
armed themselves through heavy intoxication or sleep (see also Pagelow, 1984, p. 317). 
Detailed data from the items comprising the Conflict Tactics Scale in the NFVS show 
that men and women tend to employ different kinds of violent behaviors: for example, 
wives are about twice as likely to "throw something" at their spouses (a more efficacious 
strategy if your opponent is stronger or bigger than you) while husbands are about twice 
as likely to "beat up" their spouses (Gelles &amp; Straus, 1988, pp. 250-251). Some have also 
argued that wives' assaultive behaviors are more likely to be in self-defense, but Straus 
and Gelles (1990b, pp. 104-105) reported that there was no difference between husbands 
and wives in the likelihood of initiating physically assaultive encounters. Another con-
troversial finding from the NFVS is that women are at least as likely as men to abuse their 
children (Gelles, 1979): critics have charged that since mothers spend more time with 
children and are saddled with more responsibility for them, uncorrected comparisons of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>286 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>mothers' and fathers' use of violence toward children are invalid (Kruttschnitt, 1994, p. 
311; Pagelow, 1984, pp. 184-198). The NFVS data also suggest that fathers' use of vio-
lence against children is more likely to be severe (Gelles, 1979), but recall that children 
are murdered by their mothers somewhat more frequently than by their fathers. 
</p>
<p>Unlike homicide, assaults by other (nonspousal) family members also appear to be 
directed disproportionately at female victims, at least for simple assaults, but data may 
suffer from reporting bias. Data from the NCS indicate that both men and women report 
victimization by other family members at a rate of 0.4 per 1000 for aggravated assault, 
but women's victimization rate for simple assault by other family members is 2.2 com-
pared with 0.7 for men (Bachman &amp; Saltzman, 1995). There is some evidence, however, 
that men's assault victimization by family members is more frequent than these data 
would indicate (Kruttschnitt, 1994, pp. 307-308). American men are only about half as 
likely as women to report simple assaults to police, and their self-reports in surveys may 
also be lower because they are less likely to recognize male-to-male family incidents as 
assault victimizations unless they sustain a serious injury. Several factors may contribute 
to the lower recognition of male-to-male family incidents as assaults: such incidents may 
seem less counternormative than those between males and females; they may involve 
more mutuality of both combat and injury infliction, especially for less serious assaults; 
and men may have more of a problem in depicting themselves as the losers/victims in 
physical encounters with brothers, sons, and fathers. If one could correct for these factors, 
the observed gender differences in assault victimization by parents, children, and siblings 
may well diminish, disappear, or reverse themselves&mdash;in which case the incidence of 
family assaults for men and women would be more consistent with the pattern for family 
homicides. Data from the National Incidence Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect indi-
cate that male and female children suffer very similar rates of physical abuse in the United 
States (Sedlack &amp; Broadhurst, 1996; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 
1988), although male children may be somewhat more likely to be seriously injured 
(Sedlack &amp; Broadhurst, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Data from the NCS indicate that relationships with friends and other associates pose 
a significant source of assault risk for both men and women: this risk is somewhat higher 
for men than for women, but it is still the highest source of assaults on women, with 
women being somewhat more likely to be assaulted by a friend or associate than by an 
intimate (Bachman &amp; Saltzman, 1995, p. 3). The relative significance of friends and associ-
ates may be overstated because of greater underreporting bias with intimate assaults, but 
friends and associates do appear to be a significant source of physical violence in women's 
lives that has not been given analytic attention. For men, the primary risk of assault 
comes from friends or associates and from strangers, and their risk of assault exceeds 
women's in both of those categories but especially the latter (Bachman &amp; Saltzman, 1995). 
</p>
<p>2.4. Rape, Sexual Assault, and Coercive Sex 
</p>
<p>This category of violent crime is the only one in which women are the prime victims: all 
</p>
<p>but a minuscule proportion of rapes and sexual assaults have male offenders and female 
</p>
<p>victims (Bachman &amp; Saltzman, 1995, p. 3; Greenfeld, 1996, p. 10). In addition, female 
</p>
<p>children are about three to four times more likely than male children to be sexually abused 
</p>
<p>(Reiss &amp; Roth, 1993, p. 69; Sedlack &amp; Broadhurst, 1996; U.S. Department of Health and 
</p>
<p>Human Services, 1988). The widespread incidence of rape was publicized by Brownmiller </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 287 
</p>
<p>in her important book (1975). Brownmiller argued compellingly that the then-common 
portrayal of rape as a rare and anomalous crime was inaccurate: whenever women be-
come a subject population through war, slavery, riots, pogroms, revolutions, imprison-
ment, police custody or other circumstances, rape and other forms of sexual exploitation 
are a routine accompaniment. Since the 1970s, scholars have struggled to develop precise 
estimates of the incidence of rape, a goal made elusive by both chronic underreporting 
and widespread confusion about what constitutes a rape. Estimates of the number of 
women in the United States who have been raped at least once in their lifetimes range 
from 3,750,000 to 16,500,000 (Von et al., 1991, p. 97). Forcible rapes, defined restric-
tively as "the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will," that is, forced 
vaginal penetration (FBI, 1989, p. 15; Greenfeld, 1997, p. 31), have comprised about 6% 
to 7% of all violent crimes reported to law enforcement agencies in the United States in 
recent years (Greenfeld, 1997; Koss, 1992, p. 63; Von et al , 1991, p. 100). 
</p>
<p>The Uniform Crime Reports (FBI, 1977-1996) for the years 1976-1995 report an 
annual victimization rate in the United States of about 52 forcible rapes per 100,000 
females in 1976, rising steadily to a rate of about 84 in 1992 (a total of 109,060 forcible 
rapes), and then dropping slightly in each of the subsequent years to a rate of about 72 in 
1995 (Greenfeld, 1997). Whatever the meaning of the variation in the rate of forcible 
rape over the past 20 years (that is, the extent to which it results from changes in willing-
ness to report rape victimization to police or changes in the actual incidence of rape), it is 
widely acknowledged that rape is "one of the most underreported of all index crimes" 
(FBI, 1982, p. 14; Koss, 1992; Von et al., 1991). Government estimates indicate that for 
every rape reported to police, three to ten rapes remain unreported, and some estimates 
place the percentage unreported even higher (Von et al., 1991, p. 101). Data from the 
NCS for 1992-1993 suggest annual victimization rates for rape or sexual assault of about 
400 per 100,000 for women and 50 for men, about five times the rates reported by law 
enforcement agencies (Bachman &amp; Saltzman, 1995, p. 3). The NCS figures are them-
selves considered an underestimate by many scholars, because of the extreme sensitivity 
of the questions, the lack of confidentiality of the household interview, the failure to 
match many interviewers to respondents by gender and ethnicity, the framing of the ques-
tionnaire in terms of crime victimization (many respondents may not recognize their 
victimization as a crime, especially if it was committed by an acquaintance, boyfriend, or 
spouse), popular confusion about what constitutes a rape or sexual assault, and the exclu-
sion of series victimizations from the calculation of rates (Koss, 1992). A national survey 
on sexuality conducted by the General Social Survey in 1992 employed a broader defini-
tion of forced sex: those data indicate that about 23% of women and 4% of men have been 
victims of forced sex at least once in their lives, and virtually all the women's cases but 
only one half of the men's involved a perpetrator of the opposite sex (Laumann et al., 
1994, pp. 335-336; see Russell, 1984, p. 35, for similar figures for women from an ear-
lier probability sample of women in San Francisco). 
</p>
<p>As with wife battering, the injuries sustained by rape victims are not only bodily but 
also psychological: analysts have emphasized that coerced sex is a traumatic event with 
long-term psychological consequences such as fear, anxiety, loss of control, betrayal of 
trust, self-blame, low self-esteem, embarrassment, humiliation, shame, depression, alco-
holism, and attempted suicide (Darke, 1990; Finkelhor &amp; Yllo, 1983; Laumann et al., 
1994, pp. 338-339; Russell, 1982; Stanko, 1985, pp. 70-82; Von et al., 1991). There is 
also evidence that a significant proportion of rapes (about one quarter) include acts that 
appear to be specifically intended to humiliate the victim, such as victim stimulation of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>288 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>the offender, offender masturbation, or oral or anal penetration (Darke, 1990, pp. 62-65). 
Unfortunately, victims who avoid physically resisting their sexual assailant to minimize 
physical injuries may become more vulnerable to psychological injuries such as loss of 
control, self-blame, and low self-esteem. 
</p>
<p>Data from both victimization surveys (the NCS) and convicted, imprisoned rapists 
indicate that the probability of being raped or sexually assaulted is highest for women 
who are younger (ages 16 to 24), from low-income households, and city dwellers (Greenfeld, 
1997; Perkins &amp; Klaus, 1996; Taylor, 1997; Von et al., 1991, p. 101). As with assaults 
and homicides, African-American women have a higher rate of victimization than white 
women (Katz &amp; Mazur, 1979, pp. 39-40; Perkins &amp; Klaus, 1996; Reiss and Roth, 1994, 
pp. 69-70; Von et al., 1991, p. 101), although the racial difference may have declined in 
recent years, and data from the 1995 NCS show no racial difference (Taylor, 1997). 
</p>
<p>One of the most important&mdash;and provocative&mdash;facts to surface about the incidence 
of rape in the past 20 years is the high proportion of rapes and sexual assaults in which 
the offender is someone known to the victim. Only about 30% of the victims of rape offenders 
in State prisons were strangers: 1.5% were spouses or ex-spouses, 9% were girlfriends, 14% 
were children or stepchildren, 5% were other relatives, and 41 % were acquaintances (Greenfeld, 
1997, p. 24). Russell's landmark study of marital rape (1982) reported that in her probability 
sample of San Francisco women, 14% of women who had ever been married said they 
had been raped by a husband or ex-husband (see Finkelhor &amp; Yllo, 1983, for similar 
results from a survey in Boston): Russell considers this figure an underestimate, because 
of underdisclosure by her respondents, confusion of many respondents about the concept 
of forced sex within marriage, and the conservative definition of rape used in the study 
(1982, pp. 58-59). Several scholars also report that marital rape often co-occurs with 
other forms of marital violence (see, e.g.. Pagan &amp; Browne, 1994, pp. 164-166; Frieze, 
1983; Frieze &amp; Browne, 1989, pp. 186-190; Pagelow, 1984; Walker, 1979). Of the forced 
sex victimizations reported by a nationally representative sample of adults, only about 
4% were perpetrated by a stranger, whereas 55% were perpetrated by a spouse or some-
one with whom the respondent had a romantic relationship, 22% by someone else the 
respondent knew well, and 19% by an acquaintance (Laumann et al., 1994, p. 338). 
</p>
<p>Analysis of the prevalence of rape cross-culturally is a difficult venture, since mea-
surement problems are exacerbated when one factors in different constructions of sexual 
behaviors across cultures and observers. However, Sanday (1981) conducted a careful 
analysis of the prevalence of rape in a sample of 156 cultures representing the six major 
regions of the world, dating from 1750 B.C. (Babylonians) to the late 1960s. Her coding 
of data from the HRAF and other ethnographic sources counted all forms of rape, includ-
ing rape of enemy women, rape as a ceremonial act, and use of rape as a threat. She found 
wide variation in the prevalence of rape across cultures: about 18% were classified as 
"rape prone" (indicating rape was an accepted practice), another 35% as having a moder-
ate propensity for rape, and in 47% of the cultures rape was reported as rare or absent. 
Higher rape prevalence was found in societies with high base rates of interpersonal and 
intergroup violence, pronounced male dominance, and sex-segregated structures or places. 
</p>
<p>2.5. Sexual Harassment 
</p>
<p>Until 1976 there was not a precise, shared social definition of sexual harassment 
</p>
<p>(MacKinnon, 1979). Since then, there has been increasing awareness about unwanted </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 289 
</p>
<p>physical and verbal behaviors of a sexual nature that interfere with the conduct of profes-
sional or work relations, and the inception of research on the incidence of sexual harass-
ment. That research suggests that sexual harassment primarily, but not exclusively, in-
volves female victims. Mail surveys of large, probability samples of American Federal 
workers conducted by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (U.S. MSPB) in 1980, 
1987, and 1994 found that more than 40% of female employees and 15% to 19% of male 
employees reported at least one form of sexual harassment victimization during the pre-
vious 2 years; younger women were especially likely to have been harassed (U.S. MSPB, 
1995). Respondents were asked specifically about victimizations by fellow workers in-
volving actual or attempted rape or assault; pressure for sexual favors; deliberate touch-
ing, leaning over, cornering, or pinching; sexual looks or gestures, letters, telephone 
calls, or materials of a sexual nature; pressure for dates; sexual teasing, jokes, remarks, or 
questions; and, in the 1994 survey only, unwanted following or intrusion into the 
respondent's personal life. Milder forms of sexual harassment were mentioned much 
more frequently, with 37% of the women and 14% of the men mentioning sexual teasing, 
jokes or remarks, and 4% of the women and 2% of the men mentioning actual or at-
tempted rape or assault (see also Schneider, 1993, for comparable results from a cross-
sectional sample drawn from street and telephone directories). In 1994, a co-worker was 
named as the perpetrator by almost 80% of both male and female victims of sexual ha-
rassment, but female victims were about twice as likely as male victims to have been 
harassed by a supervisor (28% vs. 14%), whereas male victims were more likely to have 
been harassed by a subordinate (11% vs. 3%) (some victims were harassed from more 
than one source). These gender differences probably reflect the disproportionate repre-
sentation of males in supervisory positions. Sexual harassment is also a pervasive feature 
of student life. Victimization surveys of university students suggest that anywhere from 
17% to 30% of female and about 2% of male students report having been sexually ha-
rassed by their teachers (Benson &amp; Thomson, 1982; McCormack, 1985). Again, the dis-
proportionate representation of males on college faculties in itself puts female students at 
greater risk of sexual harassment from their teachers. 
</p>
<p>Sexual harassment profoundly affects the quality of the victim's work or school life. 
Several studies indicate that about one in ten women leave their jobs as a result of sexual 
harassment, and university students who have been harassed may drop courses or change 
majors: all of these effects may derail careers or lower earnings (Gutek &amp; Koss, 1997, pp. 
153-154). Harassment can also cause a deterioration in interpersonal relationships at 
work or school, feelings of loss of control, and decreases in job satisfaction, self-esteem, 
feelings of competence, and work productivity (Gutek &amp; Koss, 1997, pp. 153-154; Stanko, 
1985; U.S. MSPB, 1995, pp. 26-27). 
</p>
<p>The media have been giving increasing attention to the issue of sexual harassment 
in the military, and it seems plausible that an organization that relies so heavily on physi-
cal harassment as an intrinsic part of the training of all recruits might be especially prone 
to sexual harassment. Comparative data for civilian employees in various U.S. govern-
ment agencies, including the Air Force, Army, and Navy, suggest that, among civilian 
employees, the armed forces are at the high end of the range in levels of sexual harass-
ment but not exceptional (U.S. MSPB, 1995, p. 15). A probability survey of enlisted 
personnel and officers in the Navy conducted in 1989 reported that more than 60% of the 
women and over 30% of the men said sexual harassment is a problem in the Navy 
(Culbertson, Rosenfeld, Booth-Kewley, &amp; Magnusson, 1992, cited in Gutek &amp; Koss, 1997). 
A study of 30,000 personnel in the U.S. Army reported that about 22% of the women and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>290 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>7% of the men had experienced some kind of sexual harassment within the past year: the 
report concluded that "soldiers seem to accept such behaviors as a normal part of Army 
life" (Priest, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Across the gamut of public settings, the lower status of women and the pervasive, 
proprietary interest in their bodies has made them more vulnerable than men to a variety 
of forms of sexual harassment. Studies based on ethnographic, experimental, and survey 
data have documented the many forms of intrusive harassment to which women are dis-
proportionately vulnerable on the street and in other public places. Catcalls, wolf whistles, 
staring, touching, pinching, body-grabbing, suggestive or evaluative personal comments, 
and verbal slurs are commonly reported (Gardner, 1995; Henley, 1977; Henley &amp; Free-
man, 1979; Henley &amp; Harmon, 1985). The ready availability and public display of porno-
graphic materials reinforces the sense of sexual vulnerability of women in general, as 
well as highlighting their self-conscious awareness of cultural demands about their per-
sonal appearance and sexual commodification (Dworkin, 1981; Flowers, 1994, pp. 179-
185; MacKinnon, 1993; O'Toole &amp; Schiffman, 1997, pp. 365-423; Reiss &amp; Roth, 1993, 
pp. 111-112). Some forms of harassment, such as obscene phone calls ore-mail messages 
and stalking, pursue women when they retreat into their homes (Flowers, 1994, pp. 186-
192; Sheffield, 1993; Smith &amp; Morra, 1997; Spitzberg &amp; Cupach, 1996). Criminal jus-
tice authorities have become increasingly aware of the potential for physically violent and 
even lethal outcomes from stalking. Data from a telephone survey of a national probabil-
ity sample of 8000 women and 8000 men indicate that 8% of adult women have been 
stalked at some time in their lives (compared with 2% of adult men), that most stalking 
victims are young, and that almost one half of stalking victims are overtly threatened by 
their assailant (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 1997). When women are stalked by former intimate 
partners (the majority of cases), about one third of the victims are eventually sexually 
assaulted by the stalker and over 80% are physically assaulted (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 
1997). 
</p>
<p>2.6. Bodily modiflcations 
</p>
<p>Women's bodies have been especially vulnerable to physical modification through a vari-
</p>
<p>ety of invasive, painful, and often debilitating "beauty practices" and genital mutilations 
</p>
<p>(Brownmiller, 1984; Wolf, 1992). These widespread practices are usually depicted as 
</p>
<p>symptoms of misogyny, aimed at maiming, crippling, and weakening women. However, 
</p>
<p>it is also possible that the high value placed on women's sexual and reproductive at-
</p>
<p>tributes is a powerful motivator to both men and women to commodify and package 
</p>
<p>women's bodies in ways that exaggerate their biological distinctiveness and highlight 
</p>
<p>women's contract with men to exchange exclusive sexual access rights for longterm eco-
</p>
<p>nomic support of women and their offspring (Engels, [1884] 1972). 
</p>
<p>Throughout history, women have subscribed to a variety of facial and bodily alter-
</p>
<p>ations that have adversely affected their physical and psychological functioning. The 
</p>
<p>injuries sustained by women in the pursuit of beauty range from minor to severe: restric-
</p>
<p>tion of physical mobiUty, endurance of physical pain or discomfort, relentless lifetime 
</p>
<p>effort, and constant self-criticism and sometimes humiliation before an unattainable beauty 
</p>
<p>standard. Perhaps the most infamous beauty practice on record is the Chinese custom of 
</p>
<p>footbinding, which survived for about 1000 years (until the early years of the twentieth 
</p>
<p>century) as a rudimentary beauty standard and requirement for marriageability. Young </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 291 
</p>
<p>girls (usually beginning at about 5 to 8 years of age), under their mothers' coercive super-
vision, had their feet bound increasingly tightly, with a 3-inch foot being the ideal (Blake, 
1994; Dworkin, 1994; Levy, [1966] 1992; Mackie, 1996; Mann, Sledzik, Owsley, &amp; 
Droulette, 1990). As with many beauty ideals, few women attained it, but upper-class 
women (or aspirants) were held to the most rigorous standard, and thus the physically 
dysfunctional, crippled woman became the emblem of upper-class membership (Dworkin, 
1994; Levy, [1966] 1992). The practice achieved an irreversible alteration to the girl's 
feet that drastically reduced her physical mobility; upper-class women could not walk 
unassisted and were able only to hobble over short distances. Their feet were in constant 
pain for at least the first 6 to 10 years of formative treatment, and complications included 
ulceration, paralysis, gangrene, and mortification of the lower limbs; it is estimated that 
footbinding injuries caused the deaths of perhaps 10% of girls (Mackie, 1996). The femi-
nine struggle for small feet has not been exclusive to footbinding: women in the industri-
alized nations continue to force their feet into shoes that are too small and that have high 
heels, thus restricting their mobility and causing a variety of foot injuries over the life 
span to which men are not subject (Jackson, 1990). 
</p>
<p>Several Western beauty practices have been the focus of research because of their 
injurious outcomes. The common use of tight corsets to produce an exaggerated hour-
glass torso in the nineteenth century and earlier restricted breathing, induced fainting, 
broke ribs, and sometimes caused prolapse of the uterus (Brownmiller, 1984; Wolf, 1992). 
When women threw away their corsets in the twentieth century, "dieting" became a wide-
spread female practice, whereby girls and women rely on restricted calorie intake rather 
than mechanical devices to decrease their body sizes. Most women in the industrialized 
nations impair their physical and psychological well-being through constant or sporadic 
dieting regimens and relentless self-criticism, and, in extreme cases, women succumb to 
life-threatening eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia (new diseases undocu-
mented before the demise of the corset) (Brownell &amp; Rodin, 1994; Brownmiller, 1984; 
Rodin, Silberstein, &amp; Striegel-Moore, 1985; Wolf, 1992). The recent advent of advanced 
surgical techniques has also encouraged an unknown number of women to submit to 
painful and sometimes hazardous surgeries such as face lifts, breast implants, liposuction, 
and laser removal of wrinkles (Siebert, 1996). An increasing number of young women in 
the industrialized nations resort to painful body modifications, such as body piercing 
(including nipple and genital piercing) and tattooing, which were formerly associated 
with premodern cultures. Men have not been entirely immune from the painful pursuit of 
modifications in physical appearance. Men in premodern societies and working-class 
men in industrial societies have long subjected themselves to tattoos on their arms, torsos, 
or faces as a way of displaying group identification as well as their ability to endure pain. 
In the contemporary United States, increasing numbers of men are modifying their per-
sonal appearance with hair transplants and other types of cosmetic surgery (Siebert, 1996). 
</p>
<p>The urge to commodify and control women's sexual capacity perhaps finds its most 
explicit expression in female genital mutilation, which has been receiving increasing 
publicity in recent years. It is practiced in about two dozen African countries, where it is 
a requirement for marriageability and ethnic identification, affecting the health and well-
being of an estimated 132 million women (World Health Organization, 1996). The prac-
tice ranges from the relatively mild clitoridectomy (removal of the clitoris) to genital 
infibulation (removal of the entire outer portion of the genitals and the stitching up of 
what is left with just a pencil-sized aperture left for urination and menstruation). The 
majority of people who practice some form of female genital mutilation are poor and have </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>292 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>no access to sterile instruments or anesthetic. Girls between early childhood and adoles-
cence (the age varies across cultures) are subjected by their older female relatives to this 
excruciatingly painful operation. There are a wide range of adverse medical outcomes, 
both immediate and permanent, such as pain, hemorrhage, shock, psychological trauma, 
acute urinary retention, urinary infection, blood poisoning, fever, tetanus, or death after 
the procedure, and subsequently diminished sexual responsiveness (with the least inva-
sive forms of mutilation), painful intercourse (with infibulation), infertility, hazardous 
childbirth, difficulty urinating and menstruating, and recurrent infections (Dorkenoo &amp; 
Elworthy, 1992; El Career, 1982; Harvard Law Review, 1993; Inborn &amp; Buss, 1993; 
Lightfoot-Klein, 1989; Mackie, 1996). 
</p>
<p>The desire to control sexuality, to use sexuality as a fundamental ethnic marker, and 
to restrict who has sexual access to privileged women, have led primarily to a concentra-
tion of effort on the female body, but they have also impelled numerous examples of male 
genital mutilation. The emblem of Jewish male identity is the circumcised penis, and 
many premodern cultures include circumcision (without anesthetic) as part of adolescent 
initiation ceremonies. Several Aboriginal tribes in central Australia subject their adoles-
cent men to genital subincision during initiation, in which an incision of about 1 inch 
length is cut on the underside of the penis, and the wound is ceremonially reopened at 
periodic intervals throughout the man's life (Berndt &amp; Berndt, 1964; Montagu, [1937] 
1974). Castration was a requirement for male employment as a household servant in the 
imperial courts in the Ming dynasty in China, and thousands of young men underwent 
this dangerous, painful, and humiUating operation in the hope of gaining such employ-
ment (Tong, 1988, p. 113). Indeed, until the late nineteenth to early twentieth century, the 
eunuch occupied a venerable place in the administration of secular and religious rule in a 
wide range of locations, including Rome, China, Byzantium, Egypt, and (until 1878) the 
Papal Choir of the Sistine Chapel (Tannahill, 1992, pp. 248-254). Eunuchs were viewed 
as sexually nonthreatening guards for harems and upper-class women and as incorrupt-
ible administrators because of their inability to father offspring. Castration was also em-
ployed as a punishment throughout history and across cultures until the early twentieth 
century. In the United States, it was part of the repertoire of punishment used against 
slaves and it was sometimes (with increasing rarity in the twentieth century) inflicted on 
black men who were lynched or institutionalized (Elkins, 1968; Hall, 1983; Kolchin, 
1993; Stampp, [1956] 1989; Wright, 1994; Wyatt-Brown, 1982). 
</p>
<p>The reproductive ability of both men and women has been recurrently subject to 
attack in the cause of class or racial domination or eugenics. With the advent of more 
advanced surgical techniques in the late nineteenth century, women's reproductive ability 
became more vulnerable to control. For example, recent revelations indicate that more 
than 70,000 women and a much smaller number of men were sterilized in Scandanavia 
between 1929 and 1976 for a variety of reasons relating to their presumed reproductive 
fitness {The Economist, 1997). Some policymakers continue to view poor welfare moth-
ers in the United States as a target for sterilization policy. 
</p>
<p>2.7. Infanticide, progenicide, femicide 
</p>
<p>In resource-poor societies, especially preindustrial ones, there is evidence that infanticide 
</p>
<p>is widely practiced as a makeshift means of birth control. Minturn and Shashak (1982, 
</p>
<p>cited in Ember &amp; Ember, 1995, p. 28) report that infanticide occurs in 53% of their </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 293 
</p>
<p>mostly preindustrial sample societies. It appears to be used primarily to eliminate illegiti-
mate children with no male to support them or to achieve a spacing of children that will 
not strain material or social resources (see also Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988; Skinner, 1993). 
Such infanticide appears to be motivated by pragmatic concerns about resource allocation 
in societies that do not have access to safe birth control or abortion, and it almost always 
occurs before the ceremony that socially marks or announces a birth (Minturn &amp; Shashak, 
1982). Scheper-Hughes' ethnographic study of poverty-stricken mothers in urban Brazil 
(1992) reveals that they sometimes choose to abandon or neglect weaker or sickly chil-
dren in order to reallocate their meager resources to stronger children with better survival 
odds. Such infanticide and progenicide appears to be gender neutral in terms of its vic-
tims, but it is women&mdash;by virtue of their biological link to the child&mdash;who are generally 
saddled with the perpetration of the destructive behavior. 
</p>
<p>It has also come to light in recent years that in a number of economically less devel-
oped societies, female children and women are being systematically neglected, aban-
doned, or murdered (or female fetuses selectively aborted where technology permits), so 
that the ratio of females to males in the population is artificially low. There have been 
scattered reports of selective infanticide of female newborns, and consistent and system-
atic observations of the selective withholding of food and medical support from female 
children and women in India, China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh (Coale, 1991; Sen, 1990, 
1992; Venkatramani, 1992). Symptomatic of the problem are the widespread reports of 
"accidental" sari burnings in many parts of India, in which young brides are allegedly 
burned to death or driven to suicide by their in-laws after they have procured their dow-
ries (Kelkar, 1992). Serious shortfalls have been estimated in the proportion female in the 
populations of India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, West Asia, Egypt, and some 
other North African countries (Coale, 1991; Sen, 1990, 1992). Sen (1990) originally 
estimated that more than 100 million women are missing worldwide (half of them in 
China), using the ratio of females to males in Europe, the United States, and Japan as the 
benchmark to evaluate the relative shortfall of women in selected Asian and African 
countries. However, this estimate was inflated, primarily because of the artificially low 
proportion of males in the "benchmark" countries caused by battle deaths in World Wars 
I and II (see War Casualties below), and also because it did not make appropriate adjust-
ments for the fertility and mortality rates and population age structure of the affected 
countries. Coale's reanalysis yields a "rough approximation" of the number of "missing 
females" worldwide as about 60 million, still an enormous number. The two most popu-
lous nations in the world contribute disproportionately to this number, with 29 million 
missing females in China and 23 million missing in India (Coale, 1991, pp. 521-522). 
When expressed as a percentage of a nation's female population, it is Pakistan that is the 
worst offender, with just under 8% of its females missing. The comparable figure for 
China is 5.3%; for India 5.6%; and for Bangladesh, Nepal, West Asia, and Egypt about 
2% to 4% (Coale, 1991, p. 522). 
</p>
<p>Sen argues convincingly that this rudimentary discrimination against women is ex-
plained primarily as a resource-management strategy of families in systems in which 
inheritance rules favor sons and make daughters costly. Whereas sons are the parents' 
ticket to economic security in their old age, daughters are an economic liability for the 
household, and thus their welfare is sacrificed to the economic interests of the remaining 
family members (Sen, 1990). "Surplus" daughters are especially problematic. One study 
in Khanna, India, found that the death rate before age 5 for daughters with no older 
sisters was little different from the male death rate, but for females with an older sister it </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>294 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>was about 50% higher than for males (Das Gupta, 1987, cited in Coale, 1991, p. 521). In 
China, the introduction of the one-child-per-family rule in 1979 made even firstborn 
daughters a threat to the long-term economic prospects of the parents: that, combined 
with changes in economic policy that dismantled the commune system and made families 
more economically self-reliant, resulted in a deterioration in the relative life expectancy 
of women and a dramatic increase in the rate of female infant mortality from 37.7 per 
1000 in 1978 to 67.2 in 1984 (Sen, 1990, p. 65). Sen insists that the selective neglect or 
abandonment of females in some cultures cannot be explained satisfactorily in terms of 
prejudice against women, but is instead explicable in terms of sons' versus daughters' 
economic value to the family, along with the lack of governmentally ensured old-age 
benefits. He suggests that in those poorer countries in which women have increased their 
labor force participation (even in menial jobs), women's risk of selective neglect has 
declined because of their enhanced economic value to their families. There is also some 
evidence that provision of communal social security and health programs diminishes the 
material bias against girls and women (Sen, 1990). 
</p>
<p>2.8. War casualties 
</p>
<p>Nations have long expected their young men to be ready to sacrifice their lives as soldiers 
for the security of the remaining citizenry or to protect the "national interest." The num-
ber of men whose lives have thus been squandered in international and civil wars (includ-
ing only those wars with at least 1000 battle deaths) is estimated to have totalled about 
5,000,000 between 1816 and 1900, while the twentieth century had, by 1980, swallowed 
up the lives of about 36,000,000 men in battle deaths (Small &amp; Singer, 1982, pp. 78-99, 
221-233). World War I alone took the lives of 9,000,000 soldiers in battle, and another 
15,000,000 soldiers were killed in World War II. Germany sacrificed about 5% of its male 
population in WWI and then another 10% a few years later in WWII. By the time the 
USSR pulled out of WWI in December 1917, it had already lost about 2% of its males in 
battle, and in WWII the USSR sacrificed about another 9% of its males (Small &amp; Singer 
1982, pp. 89, 91). The most devastating recorded battle casualties were sustained by 
Paraguay in the Lopez War (1864-1870), in which an estimated 90% of Paraguay's male 
population was killed in battle (Small &amp; Singer, 1982, p. 84). Further, for every soldier 
killed in action, approximately four or five soldiers are wounded in action, and at least 
half of those wounded suffer casualties that leave them physically or emotionally debili-
tated for the rest of their lives (Dunnigan, 1993). Men who have given their lives in war 
are typically glorified with public monuments and displays of reverence such as public 
holidays, speeches, and parades&mdash;but the objects of veneration are of course dead. War 
veterans often do not meet with the same veneration from the government or citizenry on 
whose behalf they fought. 
</p>
<p>The embroilment of civilians in war had been steadily declining since the 17th cen-
tury, but beginning with WWII, civilian casualties have become an increasing component 
of war (Wright, 1965): these casualties affect noncombatant men, women, and children 
indiscriminately. In recent history, women have also begun to join men in the ranks as 
soldiers or assistants in warmaking (although women are still barred from the infantry, 
artillery, and armor in the U.S. Army (Richter, 1997) and most other armed services). 
Both of these factors have increased women's share of wartime casualties, but it is over-
whelmingly males who have been selected as the cannon fodder of nations. Indeed, the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 295 
</p>
<p>proportion of many postwar nations' males that is "missing" because of battlefield deaths 
is roughly equivalent to the proportion of females that is missing in some less developed 
nations in the 1990s because of institutionally induced selective neglect or murder. The 
common incidence of wartime rape of women and girls (Brownmiller, 1975) should be 
placed in context: the men committing those rapes (usually in their most sexually active 
years) have themselves been transformed into a dehumanized status by the nations that 
deploy them in battle. 
</p>
<p>2.9. Lynching 
</p>
<p>Little work has been done on the effect of gender on participation in and victimization 
from mob violence, but studies of lynching in the United States are revealing. Between 
1882 and the early 1950s, it is estimated that 5000 to 6000 persons were killed by lynch 
mobs, 82% of them in the South (Hair, 1989; White, [1929]1969). The chivalrous protec-
tion and control of white women's sexuality appears to have been a central motivating senti-
ment behind the violence of the Ku Klux Klan, and in that spirit, most of the victims of 
lynching were black men. Indeed, men constituted an even higher proportion of lynching 
victims (more than 95% both nationally and regionally) than did African-Americans (who 
were 72% of lynching victims nationally and 84% of Southern lynchings) (Hair, 1989). 
The sexual protection of white women was the most frequently cited justification offered 
in defence of lynch law, and rape or alleged rape of a white woman was the second leading 
cause of lynchings (closely behind murder), accounting for about one third of the lynchings of 
both black and white victims (Hair, 1989; see also Brundage, 1993, pp. 263-264). 
</p>
<p>Women apparently did not leave their protection entirely in the hands of their menfolk. 
The participants in lynch mobs appear to have been primarily&mdash;but not exclusively&mdash; 
male. In those lynchings carried out by mass mobs, women and even children partici-
pated prominently, by "inciting the crowd with cheers, providing fuel for the execution 
pyre and scavenging for souvenirs after the lynchings" (Brundage, 1993, pp. 37-38: see 
also Cameron, 1982). Women also provided auxiliary support through their participation 
in the Women of the Ku Klux Klan when the Klan went through its revival in the 1920s, 
and Blee argues that "the idea of 'white womanhood' was a crucial rallying point for 
postbellum Klan violence" (Blee, 1991, p. 13).

<p>2.10. Workplace injuries, diseases, and fatalities 
</p>
<p>The cruel exploitation of women and children in the industrializing nations during the 
</p>
<p>nineteenth century is well known. The shocking engravings in British parliamentary 
</p>
<p>reports depicting the inhuman working conditions of women and children in the mines in 
</p>
<p>the early 1840s (British Parliamentary Papers, [1842] 1968) graphically illustrate the 
</p>
<p>raw fact that women and children were not exempted from the terrible suffering of the 
</p>
<p>working class in the early days of industrial development. At the same time, reformist 
</p>
<p>governmental agents chose to highlight the plight of women and children workers be-
</p>
<p>cause their misery was more offensive and shocking to public morality than the suffering 
</p>
<p>of male workers (Perot, 1990, pp. 85-87; Brandeis &amp; Goldmark, [1907] 1969). Working 
</p>
<p>conditions have steadily improved in industrialized nations in the past 150 years, and 
</p>
<p>there has been a consequent decline in the incidence of work-related injuries and deaths. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>296 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>For example, the number of work-related deaths in the United States (excluding work 
place homicides) has dropped from about 16,000 annually in the 1930s and 1940s to 
about 5000 annually in the 1990s (National Safety Council, 1995). Women's exposure to 
work hazards has been especially reduced. 
</p>
<p>Even with improvements in working conditions, serious hazards still confront many 
workers, especially blue-collar workers, and the issue remains sharply contested in la-
bor-management relations (McGarity &amp; Shapiro, 1993). The 5000 people killed by work-
related injuries in the United States in 1995 do not include the 1262 workplace homicides 
or the estimated 47,000 to 100,000 who die annually of occupationally induced diseases 
(Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 1996; National Safe Workplace Institute, 1990; Office 
of Technology Assessment, 1985; Pollack &amp; Keimig, 1987). About three quarters of the 
5000 enumerated deaths from work-related injuries in 1995 were in blue-collar jobs, and 
only about 5% were women (BLS, 1996). Thus, one benefit for women of sex-role segre-
gation in the labor force has been to shield them from many of the highest risk, blue-
collar occupations. Almost one half of the women killed at work are victims of homicide; 
even if one includes work place homicides, however, only about 9% of workplace deaths 
involve female victims (BLS, 1996; see also U.S. Department of Labor, 1994). There is 
one female-typed occupation that is very hazardous&mdash;prostitution&mdash;but its illegitimate 
status leaves it outside the net of BLS statistics. Prostitutes have always been vulnerable 
to physical assault, sexually transmitted diseases, and murder: a recent study by the Cen-
ters for Disease Control indicates that prostitutes have a much higher prevalence of AIDS 
than the general population, and a study of street prostitutes in Miami found 41 % of those 
tested were HIV-positive (Flowers, 1994, p. 178). 
</p>
<p>Women's general protection from nonfatal work injuries and illnesses in the United 
States is not as pronounced, but still substantial. Men account for about two thirds of the 
2.3 million annual work injuries and illnesses (well in excess of their 55% share of all 
private wage and salary workers) (BLS, 1994, p. 3). Women injured on the job usually 
work for health care providers, food stores, restaurants, lodging places, or other service-
producing industries (BLS, 1994, p. 3). The one type of work-related injury (other than 
workplace assaults) from which women suffer more than men is repetitive-motion inju-
ries and illnesses (most commonly carpal tunnel syndrome): women account for about 
two thirds of the 90,000 cases annually (BLS, 1994, p. 6; see also BLS, 1995). 
</p>
<p>The gradual improvement in working conditions that has marked the more highly 
industrialized nations is not shared by the newly industrializing countries of the world 
today. There is some evidence that women workers of these countries are subjected to 
especially gruelling work conditions and exploitative wages (Bradshaw &amp; Wallace, 1996, 
pp. 4-5, 104-106). Unfortunately for such women, the same jobs whose income helps to 
protect them from the worst excesses of family abuse and neglect (Sen, 1990) also expose 
them to new work-based hazards. A number of developing countries also employ an un-
counted number of women in sexually exploitative jobs (such as the thriving sex tourism 
industries in the Philippines and Thailand) that expose these women (and their children 
and subsequent sex partners) to sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS. 
</p>
<p>2.11. Deaths and Injuries from Hazardous Consumer Products 
</p>
<p>There are no systematic data on the total injuries and fatalities that are attributable to the 
</p>
<p>marketing of hazardous consumer products, and thus the overall relative risk borne by </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 297 
</p>
<p>women and men in the consumer marketplace is unknown. Women's interest in control-
ling their fertility has made them prey to hazardous birth control products, such as the 
Dalkon Shield (Finley, 1996; Szockyi &amp; Frank, 1996), and their culturally mandated 
preoccupation with personal appearance has led many women to use questionable or 
hazardous beauty products ranging from hair dyes and weight-loss products to breast 
implants (Claybrook, 1996; Szockyi &amp; Frank, 1996). The female-targeted marketing of 
hazardous reproductive and beauty products has received sporadic publicity in the media 
and has been the subject of some research on corporate violence against women. How-
ever, the two most hazardous consumer products in the United States are guns and ciga-
rettes (although the Consumer Product Safety Commission does not classify guns as con-
sumer products; Combs &amp; Donoghue, 1994): these two lethally dangerous products have 
done more damage to males' than to females' health and life expectancy. 
</p>
<p>The United States leads the industrialized world in the incidence of deaths from 
firearms, and the ready availability of firearms in the American consumer marketplace is 
more responsible than any other single factor for the unusually high homicide rate in the 
United States (Lynch, 1995). In the past decade in the United States, about 32,000 to 
38,000 people have been killed annually by firearm injuries, which includes both homi-
cides (60% to 70% of which are committed with firearms annually) and accidents (FBI, 
1981-1995; U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1993, p. 101). Guns are the play-
things of men more than of women, and about 85% of the victims of firearm deaths are 
male (U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1993, p. 101). African-American males 
have an especially high death rate from firearms&mdash;more than 64 per 100,000 (age-ad-
justed rate), compared with about 20 for white males, 8 for black females, and 4 for white 
females (U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1993, p. 101). This gender difference in 
the incidence of deaths from firearm injuries begins to appear in the 5 to 9 year-old age 
bracket (especially among blacks) and becomes particularly pronounced in the violence-
prone teen and young-adult years (U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1993, p. 100). 
</p>
<p>The leading cause of premature death in industrialized nations is tobacco, and men 
are again disproportionately the victims. In industrialized countries in the 1990s, smok-
ing accounts for an estimated 39% of all deaths in men between 35 and 69 years of age, 
compared with 15% of all deaths in women in that age bracket; over age 69, 23% of all 
male deaths and 8% of all female deaths are attributable to smoking (Peto, Lopez, Boreham, 
Thun, &amp; Heath, 1992). In the United States alone, the total number of deaths caused by 
tobacco is conservatively estimated to be 390,000 to 400,000 annually (Peto et al., 1992). 
The prevalence of smoking in the United States has decreased from 40% of adults in 1965 
to 29% in 1987, but women's use of tobacco has declined at a substantially slower rate 
than men's; in addition, the age of initiation to smoking has fallen over time, especially 
among females (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1989, p. 11). As gender 
differences in cigarette use have been declining in the United States, the gender gap in 
deaths from smoking has been steadily narrowing from the 1960s to the 1990s (Peto et 
al , 1992). 
</p>
<p>2.12. State-Mandated Punishments 
</p>
<p>Women are less likely than men to commit crimes, especially violent crimes, but there is 
fairly consistent evidence that convicted female criminals receive more lenient sentences 
than their male counterparts (Nagel &amp; Hagen, 1983). The relationship between gender </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>298 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>and the criminal justice system is discussed more fully in Chapter 26 of this volume. 
Here, I confine myself to two crimes that have been highlighted by some scholars as 
exemplifying the legal harassment or control of women: spousal murder and witchcraft. 
</p>
<p>Some analysts have claimed that our legal system, whether from misogyny or male-
biased myopia, has shown sympathy for husbands who murder their adulterous wives or 
wives' lovers, while being unsympathetic to the plight of battered wives who desperately 
kill their husbands after suffering years of escalating abuse (e.g.. Pagan &amp; Browne, 1994). 
Daly and Wilson (1988, pp. 193-196) review legal statutes cross-culturally and over time 
and argue that most legal systems have shown at least some degree of leniency to cuck-
olded husbands who turn murderous. Other scholars have emphasized that any compa-
rable sympathy for wives is lacking. They have argued that wives are only rarely moti-
vated by sexual jealousy to murder their husbands, but when battered wives murder their 
husbands at strategic moments when they are temporarily incapacitated (asleep or heavily 
intoxicated), their actions are not construed as self-defense in the narrow legal sense, and 
they are therefore subject to imprisonment for murder. Even in some cases of victim-
precipitated murder of husbands (that is, in which the victim is the first to show a weapon 
or strike a blow), defendants may be unsympathetically imprisoned for manslaughter 
(Browne, 1987; Campbell, 1992; Pagan &amp; Browne, 1994; Jones, 1980; Totman, 1978). 
However, a recent study of 540 spousal murder cases in the 75 largest counties of the 
United States (Langan &amp; Dawson, 1995) offers no support for these arguments. The study 
found that wives charged with killing their husbands (41% of the cases) were somewhat 
less likely to be convicted than husband defendants (70% vs. 87%), more likely to be 
acquitted (31% vs. 6%), if convicted were slightly less likely to receive prison sentences 
(81% vs. 94%), and if sentenced to prison received sentences on average about 10 years 
shorter (6 years vs. 16.5 years). Of course, substantially more wife defendants (44%) than 
husband defendants (10%) had been assaulted by their spouse at or around the time of the 
murder. The element of victim provocation appears to explain the gender difference in 
conviction rates, but not in the length of prison sentences (unprovoked defendants' aver-
age prison sentences were 7 years for wives and 17 years for husbands). This study thus 
suggests, at a minimum, that the contemporary legal system in the United States gener-
ally is sympathetic to the mitigating circumstances that more often provoke wives to turn 
murderous, and there is also some evidence that wife defendants are punished more le-
niently, regardless of mitigating circumstances. These results are consistent with those 
found for other crimes and with the chivalry/paternalism thesis long entertained by crimi-
nologists (Nagel &amp; Hagen, 1983; Wilson &amp; Herrnstein, 1985, pp. 112-115). 
</p>
<p>The gruesome torture and punishments inflicted by state and ecclesiastical authori-
ties on an estimated 200,000 accused witches in early modern Europe and America are 
well known (Barstow, 1995; Hester, 1992; Levack, 1995; Russell, 1972). Some feminist 
scholars have argued that the witchcraze was a classic example of femicide, in which 
unconventional women were targeted for severe punishment and death as a means of 
terrorizing and controlling all women (Barstow, 1995; Hester, 1992). That impression is 
certainly encouraged by a singular focus on the sadistic and often sexually oriented pun-
ishments and the bizarre, superstitious beliefs that surrounded accused witches. However, 
it is important to situate the witch hunts appropriately. First, they were part of a general 
preoccupation in the European states throughout this period with maintaining the pri-
macy of received Christian dogma, and freedom of speech was still a long way from being 
invented as a human-rights principle (Levack, 1995; Manchester, 1992; Peters, 1988). 
Witchcraft was a popular heretical tradition that stood as a challenge to the authority of </p>

</p>
<p>the Church (Russell, 1972), and suspected witches received treatment comparable to other 
accused heretics. Second, witchcraft was practiced predominantly by women, and thus it 
is hardly surprising that it was primarily women who fell under suspicion during state 
attempts to suppress it. Women constituted about 75% of accused witches in most locali-
ties in Europe and New England between 1509 and 1777, although the percentage female 
ranged fairly widely from lows of 32% in Russia, 42% in Estonia, and about 50% in the 
Scandinavian countries, to 90% or more in Basel, Belgium, and England (Levack, 1995, 
p. 133-134). Third, the sadistic and superstitious rules of evidence for determining witch-
hood were quite normal for their historical context (Manchester, 1992; Peters, 1988; 
Russell, 1972). Recall that the Inquisition and other state-authorized religious persecu-
tions throughout Europe during this period had equally brutal methods for dealing with 
suspected religious nonconformists, and both sorcerers and scientists suffered for their 
wayward thoughts, as did religious practitioners who strayed from received Christian 
dogma (Manchester, 1992; Peters, 1988; Russell, 1972). In short, state authorities threw 
their suspicious and punishing gaze not only on women but on all citizens. 
</p>
<p>2.13. Summary 
</p>
<p>Perhaps because violence against women, especially that taking place in intimate rela-
tionships, was overlooked by scholars for so long, much of the literature on gender and 
violence in the past 20 years has focused exclusively on violence against women: wife 
battering, rape, and sexual harassment (e.g., Brownmiller, 1975; Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1979; 
Dutton, 1988, 1995; Flowers, 1994; Stanko, 1985; Walker, 1979). This work has per-
formed an invaluable service in identifying and highlighting an important&mdash;and previ-
ously hidden&mdash;social issue, but the singularity of focus has also fostered the perspective 
that women are the special targets of male violence. This, in turn, has nourished the 
inference that it is misogyny that drives violence against women. What has disappeared 
from view are two important patterns that mark the overall relationship between gender 
and physical violence. First, men's greater proclivity for physical violence is more likely 
to be directed at other men, except in the context of intimate or sexual relationships. 
Second, women apparently do not shrink from committing violence themselves in those 
circumstances where their deficits in height, weight, and muscle mass are suspended or 
mitigated. Within the context of male-female interactions, women have been the victims 
of violence more often than men, but in those contexts where their physical deficits do not 
make them vulnerable (as in violence against young offspring and in mob violence against 
overpowered victims), women have not shown a disavowal of violence. Indeed, a meta-
analysis of research on gender and aggression concluded that differences between males 
and females are small and variable across contexts (Eagly &amp; Steffen, 1986; see also 
Bjorkqvist &amp; Niemela, 1992; Kruttschnitt, 1994, p. 328); the main systematic difference 
is for women to have a greater proclivity for verbal aggression and men for physical 
aggression. 
</p>
<p>The relationship between gender and violence thus appears to be molded by two 
primary factors: widespread social preoccupation with the proprietary protection and con-
trol of women's sexuality, and the respective physical strength of men and women. Men 
are the main perpetrators and victims of nonsexual, interpersonal violence (homicides 
and assaults), lethal violence against oneself (suicide), and various forms of nonsexual, 
corporate violence (in war, the workplace, the consumer marketplace, mob violence, and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>300 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>state-mandated punishments). It is only sexual violence that men direct primarily at women. 
Sexual access to women is generally regulated by institutional arrangements without the 
use of physical force, and concern with controlling sexual access to women on the basis of 
class or group membership has sometimes prompted surgical assaults on men's bodies 
(e.g., castration, circumcision, subincision). However, women are the primary victims of 
rape and sexual assault, and their bodies have been chronically subjected to intense pro-
prietary control, inducing rigorous beauty standards that can be painful or hazardous, a 
variety of surgical assaults, persistent and invasive public evaluation of women's physical 
appearance, and disproportionate sexual harassment of women. By the same token, women 
have been kept relatively secluded from interpersonal violence emanating from non-sexual 
relations, as well as from the hazards of the battlefield, workplace, consumer market-
place, mob violence, and state-mandated punishments. 
</p>
<p>3. CULTURAL SUPPORTS FOR VIOLENCE 
</p>
<p>A repeated refrain has been that violence against women is condoned, justified, or ex-
cused by an infrastructure of cultural beliefs and legal statutes that are misogynist. Ana-
lysts point to a long history of laws that curtail women's rights relative to their husbands 
and to popular beliefs that encourage or excuse physical and sexual violence against 
women. I reserve until the next section a separate discussion of the issue of victim blame, 
which has played such a prominent role in excusing violence against women. In this 
section, I begin by briefly reviewing the legal record of intervention in acts of violence 
against women. I then address the cultural values surrounding wife beating, rape, and 
sexual harassment, and the belief systems that mandate painful or harmful beauty prac-
tices, as well as the values surrounding male-targeted violence. In the light of this evi-
dence, it is difficult to sustain the view that violence against women is unequivocally or 
uniquely endorsed. Further, scholars have confounded violence with malice and the de-
sire to control women with a hatred for women. 
</p>
<p>To illustrate the misogynous underpinnings of our society, a number of analysts have 
referred to the infamous "rule of thumb" by which English and American law as recently 
as the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries reputedly upheld the right of a man to beat his 
wife with a rod, provided it was no thicker than his thumb. However, closer examination 
of the legal trajectory of the rule of thumb does not support the misogyny interpretation. 
The rule was originally asserted in England by Judge Buller in 1783&mdash;but English legal 
authorities challenged him and writers and cartoonists lampooned him (May, 1978; Pleck, 
1989). Some scholars have asserted that the rule of thumb became incorporated into 
American law as established precedent, and a ruling by the State Supreme Court of North 
Carolina in 1868 is a critical case cited to support this assertion (e.g.. Pagan &amp; Browne 
1994, p. 123; Jones, 1980, p. 284). However, closer inspection of that ruling reveals that 
the North Carolina State Supreme Court repudiated both the right of a husband to beat 
his wife and specifically the rule of thumb, even ridiculing the latter: 
</p>
<p>It is not true . . . that a husband has the right to whip his wife. And if he had, it is not easily seen how 
</p>
<p>the thumb is the standard of size for the instrument which he may use, as some of the old authorities 
</p>
<p>have said. . . . Thestandardis the ej&sect;^&laquo;rtprodMced, and not the manner of producing it, or the instru-
</p>
<p>ment used. (State v. Rhodes, 61 N.C. 459 [1868]) 
</p>
<p>Although the North Carolina Supreme Court did uphold the lower court's ruling that the 
</p>
<p>husband who had struck his wife with "three licks" from a "switch about the size of one of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 301 
</p>
<p>his fingers" had not violated the law, the judges emphasized that "The ground upon 
which we have put this decision is not that the husband has the right to whip his wife 
much or little; but that we will not interfere with family government in trifling cases" 
(State V. Rhodes, 61 N.C. 459 [1868]). The unusually long ruling (more than four pages) 
displays a cognizance of the sensitivity and contentiousness of the issue and a view of 
gender relations that is steeped, not in misogyny, but in paternalism. The wording betrays 
a complex set of values that includes an exalted respect for the stability and privacy of the 
nuclear family unit and the authority of its male head, denial of the seriousness of the 
specific incident, and the earnest belief that spousal love both permits and heals "impul-
sive violence." The language also reveals a disgust for the male defendant, albeit offset by 
a reticence to undermine his paternal authority. Note, too, that the case was originally 
brought by the State on behalf of the aggrieved wife, and was appealed to the State Su-
preme Court when the lower court ruled in favor of the husband&mdash;hardly evidence of 
callous neglect of the wife's grievances by State authorities. 
</p>
<p>Fleck's careful analysis of the historical record of legal intervention in domestic 
abuse cases in the United States indicates a conflicted legal approach that reflects the 
paternalistic impetus both to protect and control women (Pleck, 1987; 1989). Thus, the 
legal system has reverted back and forth between a prevailing reticence about interfering 
in family relations and sporadic attempts to stop wife abuse. The Puritans of New En-
gland passed the first laws against domestic violence in the 1640s, and scattered legisla-
tive acts, court rulings, and pohce interventions in the nineteenth century affirmed the 
right of battered wives to the full protection of the law and punished abusive husbands 
with beatings, public floggings, fines, or imprisonment (Pleck, 1987, 1989). In recent 
history, the criminal justice system has taken more initiative in the protection of battered 
women, from more vigorous prosecution of cases to the provision of temporary restrain-
ing order (TRO) workshops for women who are being harassed by assaultive partners or 
ex-partners (Ferraro, 1993; Pleck, 1987, 1989). Moreover, although some analysts have 
argued that the criminal justice system is lenient toward wife batterers, careful compari-
son of the legal treatment of intimate and nonintimate violent offenses found no system-
atic differences between them (Ferraro, 1993). Without painting too rosy a picture of the 
level of commitment or the efficacy of legal interventions on behalf of battered women, 
the recurrence of such attempts contradicts the argument that the driving force has been 
callous misogyny. 
</p>
<p>Popular attitudes about violence toward women betray the same ambivalent admix-
ture as has been found in the criminal justice system. It is not difficult to find evidence of 
popular moral repudiation of wife beaters: May (1978, p. 141) reports that in nineteenth 
century England, such customs as "noisy music," the "badger's band," and "riding the 
stang" were employed by villagers to publicly humiliate and ridicule wife beaters; Blee 
(1991, pp. 80-84) reports that in the Ku Klux Klan's revival in the 1920s in Indiana, wife 
beaters and husbands who deserted their wives and families were included among the 
long list of moral reprobates who required corrective action; countless magazine articles 
in our contemporary era decry the moral blight of wife beating; and survey data indicate 
strong, widespread disapproval of husbands hitting wives, and more so than wives hitting 
husbands (Greenblat, 1983). Similarly, rape has long been popularly viewed as one of the 
most heinous of crimes. In a large, probability survey of Americans, rape was rated one of 
the most serious of all crimes; indeed, rape requiring hospitalization was ranked as some-
what more serious than a woman stabbing her husband to death (and both were rated as 
less serious than a man stabbing his wife to death) (Warr, 1994, pp. 38-45). At the same </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>time, victims of spousal abuse, rape, and sexual harassment often meet with disbelief 
when they attempt to disclose their victimization, especially if the perpetrators are re-
spected or well liked in the community; alternatively, they find that the shame is heaped 
upon them as well. A number of studies have documented the vulgar sexual values and 
aggressive sexual depictions of women that permeate fraternities and military settings 
(e.g., Burke, 1992; Martin &amp; Hummer, 1993) (although these young male subcultures are 
marked by high base rates of male-to-male physical violence and abuse, and age has a 
strong inverse relationship to rape offending, Reiss &amp; Roth, 1993, p. 73). iStudies of male 
college students have found that 30% to 35% indicate some likelihood (and about 20% a 
somewhat stronger likelihood) that they would rape if they were assured of not getting 
caught (Malamuth, 1981; Stermac, Segal, &amp; Gillis, 1990). Public-opinion studies have 
documented a variety of myths about rape that excuse or deny it (e.g., Burt, 1980; 
Malamuth, 1981). In addition, popular attitudes about sexual harassment indicate con-
siderable confusion about appropriate norms of social and sexual interaction between 
men and women, with a large "gray area" in which many sexually aggressive behaviors 
are not readily recognized as transgressions (U.S. MSPB, 1981, 1995). Clearly, sexual 
access to women is highly prized and continually contested, even as societal norms try to 
specify the terms of such access. 
</p>
<p>Beauty practices and genital modifications that confine or mutilate women's bodies 
are supported by widespread belief systems to which both men and women subscribe. 
Despite the injurious effects of such practices, their symbolic representation in popular 
culture betrays no animosity toward women. Footbinding was revered as a sensual art 
form by both men and women in China (Levy [1966] 1992): little girls may have cried 
when they began the painful treatments that crippled them, but they no doubt learned to 
thank their mothers when their tiny feet earned them social admiration and desirable 
marriages. Genital mutilation in many African countries today is viewed by men and 
women alike as a rite of passage to womanhood that marks a woman's ethnic identity and 
enhances her physical appearance, sexual attractiveness, and reproductive ability 
(Dorkenoo &amp; Elworthy, 1992; Lightfoot-Klein, 1989). It is a basic maxim that "you have 
to suffer to be beautiful," and countless generations of women have accepted that maxim 
as a guiding principle in their lives as they have contorted and mutilated their bodies in 
the quest to become more desirable social and sexual objects. The ideology is so internal-
ized that women as well as men admire those women who excel in meeting the beauty 
standards of their day, thus adding further to the social and economic benefits that accrue 
to these behaviors. These beauty practices work to control women's behavior and sexual-
ity, but the individuals who endorse such practices are not generally driven by misogyny; 
indeed, it is the value placed on women's bodies that impels men to seek control of them. 
</p>
<p>When we take a broader view of violence, it becomes apparent that women are not 
alone in enduring violence that is sustained by popular belief systems. Men in some 
Aboriginal cultures in Australia have been goaded to undergo painful genital subincision 
in the belief that it will enhance their sexual performance, purify their bodies, and give 
them a clear ethnic marker. Many cultures have circumcised their sons in the belief that 
it is in their long-term social and health interests. Countless young men have marched off 
to war at their communities' behest amid high fanfare and incitements to glory, bravery, 
honor, and courage. Violence does not require hostility toward its victims to propel it, and 
the human record indicates an elastic capacity for violence that expands and contracts 
according to the instrumental goals of the relevant actors (Jackman, in preparation). The 
intricate networks of beliefs that bolster or repudiate specific forms of violence are shaped </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 303 
</p>
<p>by the political efforts of the contending parties, with stronger parties having a dispropor-
tionate impact. 
</p>
<p>The potency of such belief systems preempts the need for control through more overt 
means. Although some men do hate women, they are relatively rare: more commonly, as 
in other intergroup relations, dominant group members try to keep hostility out of their 
relations with subordinates in the interests of the long-term stability of the unequal ex-
change relations from which they benefit (Jackman, 1994). The goal of controlling subor-
dinates is neither facilitated by, nor does it promote, hostility toward them. The infamous 
case of Francine Hughes, who in 1977 burned her abusive husband to death when he lay 
sleeping in his bed (Jones, 1980, p. 281), demonstrates the bedrock principle that domi-
nant groups have either respected or learned the hard way; if you choose to rule by force, 
violence, and intimidation, you had better stay awake and alert at all times. As men have 
sought to control women's bodies and especially their sexuality, the coercive properties of 
conditional love have made paternalism the weapon of choice, not misogyny (Jackman, 
1994). 
</p>
<p>4. VICTIM COMPLICITY 
</p>
<p>The issue of victim complicity has been troubling and contentious in the analysis of 
violence against women. It has come up at two different levels. First, at the individual 
level, to what extent are women responsible for precipitating interpersonal violence against 
themselves in the form of partner assaults and homicides, rapes, and sexual harassment? 
For example, why do many, if not most, battered wives stay with their abusive husbands? 
To what extent do they engage in behaviors that precipitate the violence against them? 
Do some women invite rape or sexual harassment by their behaviors? Second, at a group 
level, why do women participate actively in the perpetuation of customs that mutilate 
women's bodies (either their own or their daughters') and accede to self-destructive beauty 
ideals? 
</p>
<p>Like other scholars of violence, analysts of violence against women have assumed 
that for injurious behaviors to qualify as violence, the victims must be noncompliant. 
Concern about this issue has been exacerbated by the inaccessibility of direct observation 
of most forms of violence against women, making inferences about the victim's resis-
tance or compliance especially susceptible to interpretation as people are reduced to a "he 
said, she said" scenario. A full treatment of this complex and booby-trapped issue is 
beyond the scope of this chapter, but 1 briefly outline some of the generic problems in-
volved in the assessment of victim compliance and review the main ways that these prob-
lems apply to research on violence against women. 
</p>
<p>The issue of victim compliance is confounded on two counts (Jackman, in prepara-
tion). To begin, as the extensive literature on power has amply demonstrated, the compli-
ance/noncompliance distinction is inherently ambiguous because people rarely act as free 
agents, but instead usually must make choices from a constrained set that has been prede-
termined by organizational or situational factors beyond their control (Bachrach &amp; Baratz, 
1970; Genovese, 1974, pp. 597-598; M. Jackman, 1994; R. Jackman, 1993; Lukes, 1974). 
Given a constrained set of choices, the victim's alternatives to compliance may be risky or 
futile. Depending on the agent's and victim's relative control over resources, compliance 
may be the victim's best survival strategy. Of course, individuals vary in how they re-
spond to constraints, and situations vary in the extent to which they constrict individuals' </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>304 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>options. However, we do not need to deny the existence of individual agency to recognize 
that free choices are rarer than hen's teeth. 
</p>
<p>To compound this conceptual difficulty, the compliance/noncompliance distinction 
is also difficult to observe empirically. People's revealed behaviors do not always reflect 
their preferences, especially when they are in threatening situations. Added to this, people's 
observation and recollection of events, especially volatile ones, are highly subject to bias 
and confusion. The perpetrator has self-interested reasons for portraying the victim as an 
instigator or confederate. The victim may lack either the self-confidence or the social 
credibility to counter the agent's claims effectively or she may be too shaken or humili-
ated by the event to formulate allegations with fortitude. Even outside witnesses are rarely 
unbiased, in the sense of having no personal stake in the interpretation of the event. An 
especially common bias among both bystanders and participants (including victims them-
selves) is the tendency to "blame the victim" (Bulman &amp; Wortman, 1977; Lerner &amp; 
Simmons, 1966; Miller &amp; Porter, 1983; Stark &amp; Flitcraft, 1988). In their interpretation of 
specific events, people tend to take structural risk factors as a given. Organizational ar-
rangements are a longstanding, integral part of their social environment, and they are not 
subject to individual alteration. People focus instead on individual strategies for negotiat-
ing around the risk factors that have become a normal and unquestioned part of their 
environment. For those individuals who are themselves at risk, this has the psychological 
benefit of making them feel more in control of their fate, while for others it has the benefit 
of deflecting social responsibility on to the victim. 
</p>
<p>The intricate compounding of individual agency and situational constraints is 
poignantly captured in the recollections of a foot-bound woman, recorded in China in the 
1930s (Levy [1966] 1992, pp. 237-238): 
</p>
<p>When I was just six years old, mother started my footbinding. . . . By eleven, my feet were 4.5 
</p>
<p>inches long, and bowed. On grandmother's birthday, I went with mother to visit her. My cousins had 
</p>
<p>tiny feet, and my uncle laughed at me for having such big and fat feet by comparison, saying "Who 
</p>
<p>would be willing to be your match-maker?" Everyone who heard this remark laughed, making me 
</p>
<p>so ashamed that I determined to bind my feet to the utmost in order to wipe out the disgrace. That 
</p>
<p>night, when everyone was asleep, I rebound so tightly that I had to clench my teeth because of the 
</p>
<p>pain. 
</p>
<p>My sleep that night was filled with dreams of tiny three-inch feet. The next morning, though the 
</p>
<p>pain had lessened, I had to cling to the walls for walking support. After ten days of treatment my feet 
</p>
<p>measured only 3.8 inches.. . . Three or five days later, my toes became swollen and filled with pus. 
</p>
<p>After one month, they had become nine-tenths of an inch smaller, or 2.9 inches. My feet had become 
</p>
<p>the best of the surrounding villages! 
</p>
<p>When confronted with a choice between the threat of stigmatization and material impov-
</p>
<p>erishment, on the one hand, and the promise of social admiration and economic security 
</p>
<p>on the other, most women sought the latter, even though it entailed the endurance of 
</p>
<p>physical pain and functional impairment. In the early years of the twentieth century, the 
</p>
<p>Nationalist government introduced a brutal reversal of incentives by fining families who 
</p>
<p>bound their daughters' feet and by organizing antifootbinding societies in which parents 
</p>
<p>pledged to forbid their sons to marry footbound women: a striking change was achieved 
</p>
<p>in women's behaviors (Levy, [1966] 1992; Mackie, 1996). Equally compelling constraints 
</p>
<p>apply to the practice of female genital mutilation: in many cultures, it is not only a re-
</p>
<p>quirement for marriageability but also an essential component of ethnic identity, making 
</p>
<p>the social and economic price of nonparticipation exorbitant (Dorkenoo &amp; Elworthy, 1992; 
</p>
<p>El Dareer, 1982; Harvard Law Review, 1993; Lightfoot-Klein, 1989; Mackie, 1996). The 
</p>
<p>threat of economic hardship alone was sufficiently compelling for thousands of Chinese </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 305 
</p>
<p>men in the Ming dynasty to have themselves castrated in the hope of gaining employment 
in the imperial courts (Tong, 1988), even though this involved a searing physical impair-
ment and drastic loss of social status. 
</p>
<p>For women, there has been unremitting pressure to participate in the packaging and 
commodification of their physical and sexual identity. In a male-dominated institutional 
nexus in which control over women's bodies and reproductive capacity is a highly valued 
goal, these are the precious resources within a woman's sphere of action that can make 
the difference between social success or failure. Thus, women are driven to subject their 
bodies to various forms and degrees of abuse in an attempt to excel in the beauty stan-
dards of their day and enhance their life prospects. Interestingly, in the United States, 
men have begun to get sucked into the beauty vortex themselves, with an increasing 
number of men undergoing the rigors of hair transplants and other types of cosmetic 
surgery in an attempt to promote an image of virility and success (Siebert, 1996). 
</p>
<p>The apparent complicity of women in their own victimization from forms of vio-
lence that are not culturally mandated is equally deceptive. In discussion of sexual ha-
rassment cases, the victims are sometimes accused of "playing the game" ("an A for a 
lay," Taylor, 1981), or at least of failing to express noncompliance by filing a grievance or 
quitting their jobs. Rape victims are frequently accused by both perpetrators and third 
parties of precipitating the act through their social behaviors or physical appearance or of 
actively inviting the behavior (Burt, 1980; LaFree, Reskin, &amp; Visher, 1985; Scully, 1990; 
Von et al., 1991). Battered wives are sometimes dismissed as having a pathological desire 
for abuse or of being insufficiently resolute in pressing charges against or leaving their 
abusive husbands (Browne, 1993; Jones, 1980, pp. 295-296). All of these allegations 
about the victim's responsibility for her fate fail to recognize the constraints that sharply 
curtail her options. 
</p>
<p>Workers who continue to work in settings where they are subject to sexual harass-
ment do so because they are either unaware of alternative employment opportunities or 
they fear substantial economic or career losses if they move to a new job. Once they 
decide that their best course of action is to stay on the job, they may well surmise that 
their best survival strategy is to tolerate the harassment rather than to file a grievance: the 
same factors that make the victim vulnerable to sexual harassment (her lower institu-
tional status and the lack of witnesses) also make it difficult for her to press charges 
effectively, making this a risky strategy. A few enterprising women may indeed exploit 
their sexual assets to promote their careers in an organizational setting that offers few 
other avenues of recognition. The compliance dilemma is revealed especially sharply in 
rape victimization. Police advise women that if they are sexually assaulted, their best 
survival strategy is to offer no resistance, since resistance may result in more serious 
injuries&mdash;but if the woman offers no evidence of physical resistance, she instantly under-
mines her claim to victimhood. 
</p>
<p>The options facing battered wives are also tightly constrained. They learn that at-
tempts to resist assaults by their husbands only result in worse injuries (Dobash &amp; Dobash, 
1979), but their ensuing behavioral passivity is likely to be misinterpreted as compliance. 
Battered wives who fail to leave their husbands may have little reason to believe that 
"leaving" their husbands will actually free them from physical threat. A woman with a 
possessive, bullying husband may calculate (if her husband does not spell it out himself) 
that any attempt to leave him will only incite him to further violence, and given that she 
can neither physically disappear nor go into protective custody, her choices become sharply 
foreshortened (Browne, 1987; Fagan &amp; Browne, 1994). Indeed, data indicate that women </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>306 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>who have attempted to leave their partners are especially at risk of spousal homicide 
victimization (Campbell, 1992; Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988, p. 219; Wilson &amp; Daly, 1992a, b, 
1993). Within the institution of marriage, the privacy that it affords (and the consequent 
lack of credible outside witnesses) makes it difficult to press convincing claims of 
victimhood. The victim is then confronted with the frustrating inconsistency of a society 
that expresses moral outrage about the category of behaviors but skepticism about her 
particular case. The battered wife's choices are constricted further by institutionalized 
practices that give her lower earning potential than her husband, thus reinforcing her 
economic dependence on him (Ferraro, 1993; Pleck, 1989). Women's vulnerability to 
harassment in public settings, such as the street and the workplace (Gardner, 1995; U.S. 
MSPB, 1995), reinforces their wariness of the outside world and drives them to settle for 
a partner-bodyguard, even if he poses a known physical risk himself (Jackman, 1994). In 
all but the most extreme cases of wife abuse, wives are also caught in the love trap that 
envelops paternalistic gender relations. This condones violent outbursts within intimate 
love relations and mandates forgiveness as the appropriate feminine response: with 
women's access to love and protection channelled through the institution of marriage, the 
social and emotional costs of exiting the marriage are escalated (Jackman, 1994, pp. 82-
84). Finally, women are trapped in a general "Catch-22," in which they are exhorted to 
commodify their sexual attributes and to meet a feminine behavioral ideal of deference 
and compliance, but they are then faulted when their efforts are judged to be responsible 
for luring men into sexual aggression or inviting physical assault. 
</p>
<p>In short, the apparent compliance of victims is a booby-trap. Women's lack of resis-
tance to violence against them is no more mysterious than the decision of countless armies 
of young men to march off to war, with reluctance or enthusiasm, on behalf of causes they 
may barely understand, or the recurrent decision of workers to submit to hazardous work-
ing conditions to support themselves and their families. Tobacco companies may depict 
cigarette smoking as a matter of individual choice, but it is hardly surprising that the 
unrestricted marketing of an addictive drug results in immense populations who are un-
able to quit, despite its known hazards. With any kind of violence, compliance and resis-
tance are difficult to isolate conceptually and are not easily susceptible to empirical obser-
vation or measurement. The place of individual agency in submitting to violence is variable, 
complex, and subject to bias or confusion in its observation. 
</p>
<p>5. EXPLANATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP 
</p>
<p>BETWEEN GENDER AND VIOLENCE 
</p>
<p>Theoretical explanations of the relationship between gender and violence have fallen into 
</p>
<p>two fairly discrete sets, either focusing singly on violence against women, or on gender 
</p>
<p>differences in the perpetration of violence. There has been little attempt to develop a 
</p>
<p>broad theoretical account of how gender influences both victimization from and the per-
</p>
<p>petration of various violent actions. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to appraise fully 
</p>
<p>the theoretical accounts that have been offered, but I briefly outline and comment on 
</p>
<p>them. I then sketch out an explanatory approach that addresses the broad range of violent 
</p>
<p>behaviors that are practiced and endured by men and women. 
</p>
<p>Explanations of the marked gender difference in the propensity to commit violent 
</p>
<p>crimes have centered on whether the difference is due to biological or social factors. Early 
</p>
<p>work suggestedlhat men may be biologically predisposed to aggressive behaviors (Maccoby </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 307 
</p>
<p>&amp; Jacklin, 1974, 1980), but this thesis has since been discredited, on the grounds both 
that aggression is not linked clearly to hormones and that aggressive behaviors do not 
differ systematically by gender (Bjorkqvist &amp; Niemela, 1992; Eagly &amp; Steffen, 1986; 
Kruttschnitt, 1994). Since men and women differ in their rates of physically violent be-
haviors more than in aggression per se, analysts have turned to socialization factors that 
are gender specific, citing gender differences in closeness of parental supervision and 
reinforcement of physically aggressive behaviors (Kruttschnitt, 1994). As with other ar-
eas of intense debate over nature versus nurture (e.g., the IQ debate), analysts have come 
increasingly to recognize the point that geneticists have long emphasized&mdash;that nature 
and nurture are not mutually exclusive choices but instead work interactively. Biological 
proclivities allow a broad range of behavioral expressions, depending on the presence of 
nourishing or inhibiting environmental factors (e.g., Hirsch, 1973). 
</p>
<p>Most analysts who have focused on the explanation of violence against women have 
pursued one or more of the following avenues; (1) individual-level factors, relating to the 
offender and/or the victim, such as childhood socialization into violence, substance abuse, 
or emotional/psychiatric disturbances that produce either anomalous tendencies toward 
the commission of violent behaviors, or an attraction toward violent men on the part of 
battered wives and victims of rape or sexual harassment (e.g., Amir, 1971; Overholser &amp; 
Beck, 1986; Rada, 1978; Segal &amp; Marshall, 1985; Straus et al., 1980; Taylor, 1981); (2) 
social-interaction issues, relating to strains, tensions, and opportunities for violence in-
herent in family life or in male-female interaction patterns, or ambiguities in courtship 
or sexual norms (e.g., Gelles, 1983; Gelles &amp; Straus, 1988; Gillen &amp; Muncer, 1995; 
Lundberg-Love &amp; Geffner, 1989; Muehlenhard, 1989; Straus et al., 1980); and (3) gen-
der-politics issues, such as patriarchal social arrangements and male dominance, whereby 
men use physical and sexual violence to control and intimidate women (e.g., Brownmiller, 
1975; Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1979; Ferraro, 1993; Millett, 1970; Scully, 1990; Scully &amp; 
Marolla, 1993; Stark &amp; Flitcraft, 1988). All of these theoretical approaches are discussed 
in more detail elsewhere (e.g., Browne, 1993; Pagan &amp; Browne, 1994; Stark &amp; Flitcraft, 
1991; Von et al., 1991): I limit myself here to two brief comments. First, these approaches 
differ in their expectations about the generality of male-to-female intimate violence: the 
first treats it as aberrant, while the second and third approaches assume (either implicitly 
or explicitly) that violence is a normal part of male-female relations. Perhaps for this 
reason, the first line of explanation has been steadily losing ground to the second and 
especially the third: the view that social relations are driven by misogyny favors the 
depiction of violence against women as normal rather than aberrant, and the gender-
politics approach is especially consistent with this view. Second, the narrow focus on 
male-to-female violence of all these explanatory approaches has sharply limited their 
power. For example, if male violence against women is explained in terms of patriarchal 
social arrangements or special problems inherent in the institution of the family or in 
male-female interaction patterns, we are left with no explanation for the more prevalent 
male-to-male violence. 
</p>
<p>A more general theoretical explanation of violence against women has been offered 
by evolutionary psychologists, namely that evolutionary selection has favored a human 
male with strong sexual proprietariness toward women. Because the successful reproduc-
tion of humans requires a major investment from both parents, and because paternity is 
intrinsically less presumptive than maternity, the human male has evolved with a strong 
tendency toward sexual jealousy, as men wish to ensure that their parental investment is 
not squandered on someone else's offspring. This theory posits that most incidents of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>308 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>male-to-female violence involve some element of sexual jealousy (such as suspected sexual 
philandering by one's partner, fear of loss of control of or loss of loyalty by one's partner, 
or presence of stepchildren). This theory has been expounded elegantly and rigorously in 
a voluminous stream of research (e.g.. Burgess &amp; Draper, 1989; Daly &amp; Wilson, 1982, 
1988; Wilson &amp; Daly, 1992a, b, 1993; Wilson, Daly, &amp; Daniele, 1995; Wilson et al., 
1993, 1995, 1997; Wilson &amp; Mesnick, 1997), although few review essays on violence 
against women include this theory, presumably on grounds of intellectual taste. Many 
social researchers find it repugnant to address theories of human behavior that have a 
biological component: they erroneously believe that the introduction of biological factors 
rules out the influence of culture and the possibility of socially induced variation around 
genetic proclivities. This theory is alone among theories of violence against women in its 
ability to incorporate male-to-male violence as well: Daly and Wilson hold that such 
violence is spawned by men's rivalrous competition for the economic and status resources 
that will assist them in gaining control of women and enhancing their reproductive fit-
ness. 
</p>
<p>Despite its explanatory breadth and power, this theory has two shortcomings. First, 
in the attempt to subjugate all forms of violence to the drive for reproductive fitness, the 
latter is elevated to a motivational preeminence that at times seems stretched, especially 
when trying to address some of the violent behaviors manifested by women (e.g., mater-
nal infanticide). Second, the theory cannot account satisfactorily for the relative lack of 
violence perpetration among women. Women have every reason to be as jealous as men 
(and empirical observation confirms this), since evolution should have favored a woman 
who works to prevent her partner from diverting his resources to other women. However, 
women's jealousy is less likely to be expressed in violence toward their partners. 
</p>
<p>A much simpler explanation of the relationship between gender and violence is 
possible. Violent actions represent one type of behavioral strategy as people negotiate 
their way through life, attempting to maximize their control over the social, economic, 
and political resources that will enable them to make the most of their lot and provide for 
their offspring. People's use of physically violent actions depends on the presumed effi-
cacy of such actions in delivering those resources: when conditions are auspicious, most 
people apparently do not shrink from employing violent strategies. That, in turn, depends 
on the attributes of the perpetrator and the victim (their relative size and strength, and 
their relative ability to protect themselves with social, economic, or political resources), 
as well as on a number of other facilitating or obstructing factors, such as the presence or 
absence of sanctions or credible witnesses. Men, on average, commit more physical vio-
lence than women because their greater size and strength and their superior command 
over societal resources makes this a more opportune strategy for them. Most of their 
violence, however, is directed toward other men: since it is men who disproportionately 
control societal resources, most contests over resources precipitate encounters with other 
men, and violence-prone men incite each other into combat. Women&mdash;who constitute one 
of the resources over which men struggle&mdash;are less likely to rely on physical violence 
because they generaly lack the physical or institutional means to employ it successfully. 
However, women do employ violence strategically when it is physically or institutionally 
opportune: in the confinement or mutilation of their own bodies for social or economic 
purposes, and in their dealings with those physically or institutionally weaker than them-
selves (e.g., young children, lower status adults, and men who are weaker or temporarily 
incapacitated). 
</p>
<p>The longstanding unequal relationship between men and women has at its core the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Violence, and Harassment 309 
</p>
<p>contested issue of who shall control sexual access and sexual reproduction. In this con-
test, men have the biological advantage of greater size and strength, but that initial ad-
vantage has long since been converted into the establishment of social, economic, and 
political institutions that favor men (Jackman, 1994). Those institutions make the con-
stant use of physical force unnecessary to secure male control over women's bodies, and, 
indeed, stable rule is served better by less clumsy methods as men seek the amicable 
cooperation of women in their continued subordination (Jackman, 1994). Theorists who 
attribute violence against women to either patriarchal institutions or the male drive for 
reproductive fitness erroneously assume that the desire to control women drives men to 
use violent methods. On the contrary, the quest to control women's bodies has led to the 
evolution of paternalistic relations between men and women, by which men secure women's 
subordination through a system of coercive love: women are praised and rewarded for 
compliant behaviors and stigmatized for noncooperation (Jackman, 1994). Most of the 
time, this system achieves control without resorting to physical force, although some men 
do occasionally or habitually use violence to assert their authority. According to this 
approach, habitual reliance on physical violence is, indeed, an anomaly deriving from 
counternormative socialization or personality deficiencies, rather than being the central 
tendency. There is individual variability in the proclivity for physical violence, and some 
men are sadists, misogynists, psychologically disturbed, or unable to cope with the de-
mands of family life or interpersonal relationships. Other men may employ physical vio-
lence on a trial-and-error basis, testing its efficacy against alternative methods of control. 
Younger men's greater reliance on physical violence may reflect their superior physical 
strength or their lesser experience with or command of institutionalized gender arrange-
ments. 
</p>
<p>The high value placed on the resource that lies within women's bodies&mdash;sexual ac-
cess and sexual reproduction&mdash;has encouraged the proprietary protection and control of 
women more than the physical assault of women. Men assume the role of paternalistic 
bodyguards to their women, and women are exhorted to become the submissive objects of 
that protection. Thus, most men eschew physical violence in their ongoing interactions 
with women, and women are generally sheltered from the worst rigors of the battlefield, 
workplace, consumer marketplace, mob violence, and state-mandated punishments. By 
the same token, women are socially rewarded for pursuing physical weakness and emo-
tional compliance as their feminine ideals, and stigmatized for deviating from those ide-
als. In response to these pressures, most women develop deferential behavior patterns in 
their relations with men of the same class and ethnic status as themselves (but not with 
children, other women or lower status men), and they are moved, as necessary, to subject 
their bodies to physical confinement or mutilation to gain acceptance or, better yet, win 
social admiration. Individual men who use physical violence against women violate the 
basic operating principles of this system of social control, and are thus a source of pro-
found political embarrassment, triggering both moral condemnation and denial of their 
actions as other men scramble to distance themselves from these occurrences, minimize 
them, or cover them up. 
</p>
<p>According to the routine activities theory of crime (Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979; Cohen, 
Kluegel, &amp; Land, 1981), our everyday activities prime us to become either accessible or 
inaccessible as victims of specific criminal or violent behaviors. If we apply this logic, it 
might seem that the social organization of gender relations throws women in harm's way, 
since their routine activities bring them into daily, intimate contact with men, who are 
known to be more prone to physical violence. Gender relations throw women into life-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>310 Mary R. Jackman 
</p>
<p>long, intimate contact with men in an institutional setting that is emotionally saturated 
and legally sanctioned as an autonomous economic unit screened from public view. When 
one considers, further, that men generally have greater size and strength than women, it 
would seem that both physical and institutional factors prime women to become the per-
fect targets for interpersonal violence. On this basis, we should expect a high incidence of 
physical violence by men against women. Some men do indeed exploit the opportunities 
for violence against women that are thus provided them, but, in general, men are more 
likely to inflict violence on other men than on women. The answer to this apparent enigma 
lies precisely in men's long-standing concern with maintaining control over women's 
bodies. Although skirmishes and violent outbursts remain a part of the overall pattern of 
domination and subjugation, stable control is generally served more effectively by institu-

<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>Gender shapes the work opportunities, experiences, and rewards of women and men in 
industrial societies. Many sociologists agree that women's and men's participation in 
paid work, and the nature and social valuation of the work they perform, are key determi-
nants of their overall status in society. In fact, women's labor force participation rates 
have been used widely in cross-national research as a measure of women's status (Clark, 
Ramsbey, &amp; Adler, 1991; Ward, 1984; Young, Fort, &amp; Danner, 1996). When women are 
judged to be performing valued work, especially work for pay outside the home on a 
comparable basis with men, then gender inequality is minimized (Chafetz, 1984; Nielsen, 
1990). Given this, it is not surprising that gender is the most prevalent single subtopic in 
the recent sociology of work and occupations literature (Abbott, 1993; Hall, 1983). Abbott 
(1993) finds that about 20% of all work and occupations articles published in 1990 and 
1991 focus on gender issues. 
</p>
<p>The rapid influx of women into the paid labor market during this century is a dra-
matic social change warranting much attention from sociologists. Women working for 
pay is no longer the exception to the rule. In most advanced industrial nations today, the 
average worker is as likely to be female as male (Bakker, 1996). While women have

<p>always worked, the division of labor in many early industrial societies was such that 
married women often performed uncompensated work in or around the home to support 
family members. With industrialization, some groups of women, namely racial/ethnic 
minority women and working-class women, began to work outside the home for pay in 
highly gender-segregated occupations. Over the course of the century, other groups of 
women joined the ranks of paid workers, causing women's labor force participation rates 
to increase rather steadily in industrial nations. In the United States, for example, women 
accounted for 46% of the labor force in 1994 (Herz &amp; Wootton, 1996), up from 18% at the 
turn of the century (Kemp, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Traditionally, the study of work addressed primarily male workers (Acker, 1989). 
With women now representing almost one half of the labor force in industrial nations, 
sociologists have recognized the importance of supplying missing information about 
employed women. Attention has turned to issues such as: (1) What motivates women to 
be productive workers (Bielby &amp; Bielby, 1984; Lorence, 1987b; Mannheim, 1983, 1993; 
Mortimer &amp; Lorence, 1979; Neil &amp; Snizek, 1987; Rowe &amp; Snizek, 1995)? (2) What 
causes women to be satisfied with their work (Hodson, 1989; Loscocco, 1990; Loscocco 
&amp; Spitze, 1991; Martin &amp; Shehan, 1989; Neil &amp; Snizek, 1989)? (3) Do women's work 
and management styles differ from those of men, and if so, how (Colwill, 1993; Johnson, 
1976; Maile, 1995)? 
</p>
<p>Another reason sociologists have begun to focus attention on employed women is 
related to the increasingly important role they play as economic providers for families/ 
households. Whereas the majority of women who work for pay today do so out of per-
ceived economic need (Baca Zinn &amp; Eitzen, 1993), only a few decades ago discussion of 
women's labor force participation presented women's employment as secondary and supple-
mental to men's&mdash;an expendable means of improving the family's standard of living 
(Dubeck &amp; Borman, 1996). As Acker (1992, p. 54) states, "the family wage sufficient for 
a single worker to support dependents is fast disappearing; women's paid work is becom-
ing necessary for family survival." The high incidence of single adult, mostly female 
households in modern society also points to the importance of women's paid work. The 
fact that, on average, women earn less than men for the work they perform contributes to 
disproportionately high rates of poverty in female-headed households, a serious social 
problem that has come to be known as the feminization of poverty (Dunn &amp; Waller, 
1996). 
</p>
<p>The emphasis in sociology on women's increased involvement in paid work is also 
due to the fact that women's employment has broad social consequences that extend well 
beyond the economy. Families, in particular, are affected by increases in women's labor 
force participation. Traditionally, women have borne the primary responsibility for do-
mestic work. As they begin to spend significant numbers of hours working outside the 
home for pay, their ability to perform domestic work, and potentially, the quality of life of 
their families is affected. Families need to adapt to women's changing work roles by 
making other provisions for the performance of domestic work (Chafetz, 1997). Research 
suggests that this adaptation is slow in coming, in that many women today work a "double 
shift"&mdash;they still perform a disproportionate share of domestic tasks in addition to their 
paid work (Berk, 1985; Ferree, 1991; Hochschild, 1989; Schor, 1991; Steil, 1995). The 
United Nations (1995b) estimates that two thirds to three quarters of the household work 
in industrial countries is still performed by women. This inequity has resulted in much 
sociological attention to what has come to be referred to as work/family conflict (Abbott, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Paid Work in Industrial Nations 323 
</p>
<p>1993). Schools and the nonprofit sector of the economy provide other examples of social 
institutions/organizations profoundly affected by increases in women's labor force par-
ticipation in that women today seldom have time to perform volunteer work in these 
settings. More research is needed to better understand the far-reaching impact of in-
creases in women's employment. 
</p>
<p>The extensive sociological study of gender and employment results from both the 
importance of paid work in modern society and the dramatic changes in gendered pat-
terns of work participation. Because women are disproportionately affected by these 
changes, this chapter will reflect the emphasis on employed women (as opposed to men) 
found in the sociological literature. The vast literature that has emerged over the last two 
decades on gender and work makes it impossible to provide an in-depth review of all 
relevant subtopics. For this reason, we provide an overview of several major topical areas 
in this literature, highlighting representative research and significant findings in the 
following areas: patterns and rates of labor force participation, worker inputs, and worker 
outcomes. 
</p>
<p>Before turning attention to an examination of gender and participation in the labor 
force, it is important to distinguish between two distinct approaches to examining issues 
of gender and employment. An important characteristic that differentiates among socio-
logical theories and the empirical studies they generate is whether women's and men's 
labor force experiences and opportunities are viewed as affected primarily by characteris-
tics of individual workers or by structural features of society (Coverman, 1988; Kemp, 
1994). Functionalism and neoclassical economics are the best examples of the former 
types of theories; Marxism, Marxist feminism, and other materialist theories provide 
examples of the latter (Kemp, 1994; Nielsen, 1990). Because much sociological research 
is devoted to sorting out these two influences on gendered work patterns and experiences, 
the individualist versus structural theme is a recurring one in this chapter. 
</p>
<p>2. LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION AND 
</p>
<p>GENDERED PATTERNS IN THE WORKPLACE 
</p>
<p>From 1960 to 1990, women's share of the labor force increased significantly in all indus-
</p>
<p>trialized nations. Recent estimates show that women now constitute an average of at least 
</p>
<p>40% of their labor forces (United Nations Development Programme, 1992, 1995; World 
</p>
<p>Bank, 1996). Increases in female labor force participation have been particularly marked 
</p>
<p>in the Netherlands and New Zealand. Steep increases have also occurred in Australia, 
</p>
<p>Canada, Greece, Norway, and the United States. A few countries, for example, France, 
</p>
<p>Ireland, and Portugal, have experienced more moderate increases (OECD, 1994). The 
</p>
<p>rise in women's labor force activity has been accompanied by a decrease in men's rates of 
</p>
<p>labor force participation (OECD; 1985, Kemp, 1994). For this reason, gender differen-
</p>
<p>tials in some countries are diminishing while in others they remain pronounced. In 1991, 
</p>
<p>for example, the gap between male and female rates in Sweden had been reduced to 4.2 
</p>
<p>percentage points, while in Ireland it was still 42 percentage points (OECD, 1994). Table 
</p>
<p>15-1 provides an overview of changes in women's share of the labor force in 20 industrial 
</p>
<p>nations from 1980 to 1994. 
</p>
<p>The following sections provide a brief sketch of changes in women's employment 
</p>
<p>over two time periods&mdash;the 1960s through the 1970s, and the 1980s to the present. </p>

<p>2.1. Labor Force Participation Rates and Patterns in the 1960s and 1970s 
</p>
<p>The influx of women, especially married women, into paid employment in industrial 
</p>
<p>nations accelerated in the 1960s and 1970s. Structural changes in the economy that led to 
</p>
<p>a disproportionate rate of job growth in the service sector and an increased demand for 
</p>
<p>part-time labor had a strong impact on women's rates of employment (Janjic, 1985; OECD, 
</p>
<p>1993c). In the United States, for example, 79% of the new jobs created between 1973 and 
</p>
<p>1987 were in the service sector (Acker, 1992). Chaftetz (1990) argues that demand fac-
</p>
<p>tors resulting from economic expansion are a far more important determinant of women's 
</p>
<p>employment than labor supply factors. This view is supported by comparative research 
</p>
<p>that shows a strong relationship between economic growth and increases in women's 
</p>
<p>labor force participation (Clark et al., 1991; Semyonov, 1980). 
</p>
<p>While demand factors may be most important in determining women's rates of labor 
</p>
<p>force participation, numerous factors affecting the supply of women workers have also 
</p>
<p>contributed to increases in their share of the labor force. In the United States and some 
</p>
<p>other Western European nations, increasing divorce rates and rising numbers of impov-
</p>
<p>erished displaced homemakers began to cause full-time homemakers to consider the risks 
</p>
<p>of complete economic dependence on a male provider (Amott &amp; Matthaei, 1982; Dunn, 
</p>
<p>1997). In many countries, the women's movement also played a role in making paid work 
</p>
<p>appear more desirable to married women (Herz &amp; Wootton, 1996). In addition, women's 
</p>
<p>educational attainment was becoming more similar to men's and this opened doors to 
</p>
<p>more interesting and lucrative employment (OECD, 1985; United Nations, 1995a). In-
</p>
<p>creased employment opportunities led to a decline in the birth rate, which meant that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Paid Work in Industrial Nations 325 
</p>
<p>women spent less of their adult years with preschool-aged children, and thus had more 
years available to spend in paid employment (Herz &amp; Wootton, 1996; Semyonov, 1980). 
</p>
<p>Changes in occupational opportunity occurring in the 1960s and 1970s had a differ-
ential impact across groups of women (Almquist, 1995; Andersen, 1988). Age and race/ 
ethnicity, in particular, patterned the new employment opportunities available to women 
in industrial nations (OECD, 1985; Ortiz, 1994). Younger women were more likely to 
remain out of the labor force in order to extend their education and older women were 
less likely to possess the skills and educational credentials required for emerging employ-
ment opportunities (United Nations, 1985). Economic discrimination resulted in limited 
access to new jobs for minority women in many nations, but economic disadvantage 
made paid work a necessity. Table 15-2 provides labor force participation rates for women 
in the United States by race/ethnicity for 1960 and 1970. Among the groups listed, only 
Mexican, Puerto Rican, and American Indian women had lower rates of labor force par-
ticipation than white women. African-Americans, Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino women 
were all employed at higher rates than white women; however, they worked primarily in 
lower tier, personal service occupations (e.g., domestic, seamstress) and as factory opera-
tives (Ortiz, 1994). More recently, improved educational opportunities for women of color, 
combined with legal changes, have created new job opportunities for African-American 
women in the United States, especially in female-dominated, semiprofessional occupa-
tions (Higginbotham, 1994; Sokoloff, 1987). 
</p>
<p>2.2. Labor Force Participation Rates and Patterns in the 1980s and 1990s 
</p>
<p>Women's labor force participation rates in industrial nations began to level off by the late 
1980s and early 1990s. By 1992, female labor force participation rates ranged from a low 
of 46% in Italy to a high of 79% in Sweden (Baden, 1993). Economic recession in the 
early 1990s resulted in job loss in heavily male-dominated manufacturing and construc-
tion industries, causing men's labor force participation rates to decline. Concentrated in 
service sector jobs, women remained rather insulated from this recession. In most ad-
vanced industrial nations today, at least 70% of all employed women work in the service 
sector (United Nations Development Programme, 1992). 
</p>
<p>The high growth phenomenon of part-time employment also fueled demand for women

<p>laborers in industrial nations while men's employment rates were declining (Bakker, 
1996). It is important to note, however, that part-time workers in many nations earn 
lower hourly wages than full-time workers, receive fewer fringe benefits, and have fewer 
chances for career progression (OECD, 1994). Nordic countries are an exception to this 
pattern; part-time employment in these nations is fully regulated, resulting in higher 
compensation and increased access to fringe benefits. Baden (1993) reports that an in-
creasing amount of part-time work is involuntary in that the women who perform it 
would prefer full-time jobs but are unable to find them. Table 15-3 presents information 
on the size and gender composition of the part-time labor force for 21 industrial nations. 
These data show that while women make up the vast majority of part-time workers in all 
industrial nations, the proportion employed part-time varies considerably from country to 
country (OECD, 1994). 
</p>
<p>A sizable share of part-time jobs are temporary. Women's share of temporary em-
ployment is greater than men's in all industrial nations except Greece, Spain, Portugal, 
and Turkey, where higher levels of agricultural activity create many seasonal jobs for 
men (Baden, 1993). In most industrial nations, the proportion of men in temporary em-
ployment has fallen since the early 1980s while that of women has increased in all coun-
tries except the Netherlands and Germany (OECD, 1993a, b). Evidence suggests that 
much temporary employment, like part-time work, is involuntary&mdash;the majority of tem-
porary workers indicate they could not find permanent jobs (Baden, 1993). The disadvan-
tages of part-time work appear to extend to temporary workers. Not only do they typically 
earn less and have fewer benefits, Rogers (1995) finds that temporary workers in the 
United States have higher levels of workplace alienation than permanent workers. 
</p>
<p>Women's participation in paid work continues to be affected by variations in age.

<p>race/ethnicity, marital status, the presence of children, and educational level (Bakker, 
1996; OECD, 1985, 1993b). These characteristics affect women's participation in the 
labor force for two primary reasons. First, they are related to domestic/family demands on 
women's time that detract from the opportunity to work (marital status and the presence 
of children). Second, they are related to employment and earnings opportunity and to the 
opportunity costs of not working (age, race/ethnicity, and education level). Table 15-4 
presents selected population characteristics that illustrate their effects on labor force par-
ticipation rates among women in the United States in 1994. Today, women in their late 
30s and early 40s have the highest participation level, with more than 77% in the labor 
force (Herz &amp; Wootton, 1996). This represents a change from the earlier part of the 
century when rates were highest for young, unmarried women (England &amp; Farkas, 1986).

<p>Through the middle part of the century, women exited the labor force in significant num-
bers upon marriage and especially upon the birth of children, causing a dip in labor force 
participation rates for those under the age of 35. As these women reentered the labor 
force when their children reached school age, rates climbed once again, although not to 
the level for young unmarried women. Women today are far more likely to work continu-
ously (Rexroat, 1992), causing their labor force participation rates to appear similar to 
men's; increasing through the middle years, leveling off, and then declining around re-
tirement (Herz &amp; Wootton, 1996). The most dramatic increases in women's labor force 
participation in the United States in recent decades have occurred for married women 
with preschool age children. 
</p>
<p>The general patterns described for the United States and presented in Table 15-4 are 
also found in most other advanced industrial nations. One key exception is Scandanavian 
countries, Sweden in particular, whose labor market policies are highly facilitative of 
women's employment (Rosenfeld &amp; Kalleberg, 1990; Ruggie, 1984). Swedish labor mar-
ket policies provide daycare and other forms of assistance to the mothers of young chil-
dren, making it easier for them to be employed continuously. Italy and Belgium also fail 
to show a downturn in women's employment in the early childbearing years (Baden, 
1993). Increases in women's level of education relative to men have also spurred more 
continuous participation in the paid labor force. Today, in most industrial nations, women 
receive nearly the same overall level of education as men, and the most educated groups 
of women are those with the highest labor force participation rates (United Nations, 1995a). 
</p>
<p>In recent years, variation in women's labor force participation by race/ethnicity has 
also diminished in some industrial nations. For example, increases in white women's 
levels of employment in the United States have served to close the gap between white and 
African-American women (Ortiz, 1994). Rates of participation for Hispanic women in 
the United States represent marked increases over previous decades, but are still about 6 
percentage points lower than those for African-American and white women. The lower 
labor force participation rates of Hispanic women have often been attributed to cultural 
patterns that emphasize traditional roles in the family for women. The rapid increases in 
participation in paid work for women in this group suggest that such traditions are erod-
ing, or perhaps that increased employment opportunities and economic need compel women 
to deviate from tradition (Ortiz, 1994; Zavella, 1987). It is important to note that while 
labor force participation rates vary little across racial/ethnic groups, unemployment rates 
are about two times higher for racial/ethnic minority women compared to white women 
in the United States (except Asian/Pacific Islanders) (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1990). 
</p>
<p>2.3. Employment Concentration and Segregation by Sex 
</p>
<p>Despite dramatic increases in women's labor force activity this century, women continue 
</p>
<p>to be employed in a far more narrow range of occupations and industries than their male 
</p>
<p>counterparts (Roos, 1985). For example, in the Netherlands, 66.8% of women are em-
</p>
<p>ployed in 8 of the 99 professional categories, in contrast to men who are spread across 76 
</p>
<p>professional employment categories (OECD, 1993c). In G-7 countries, 60% to 75% of all 
</p>
<p>women workers are concentrated in service sector industries (Bakker, 1996). Table 15-5 
</p>
<p>presents women's share of four broad occupational categories for 13 industrial nations. 
</p>
<p>Variation across nations is marked, but in general women are most likely to be employed 
</p>
<p>as clerical, sales, and service workers. While women's rates of employment in the more </p>

<p>lucrative administrative, managerial and professional, and technical job categories are 
lower, in most countries there has been an upward trend in the last decade or so in their 
representation in these job categories (Bakker, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Women are also heavily concentrated in public sector employment in most industrial 
nations (OECD, 1994). The public sector has expanded dramatically in many OECD 
countries during the last few decades, resulting in an increased demand for women work-
ers. Sweden has experienced the greatest increase in public sector employment, with 
almost one third of all workers now employed in the public sector (Nermo, 1996). In 
contrast, the government's share of total employment in the United States has held con-
stant in recent decades, suggesting that the bulk of new jobs created for women have been 
in the private sector. Women in the public sector in Sweden are advantaged relative to 
those in the private sector in terms of both wages and access to higher tier occupations. 
The reverse is true in the United States, where many black women are concentrated in 
lower tier positions in the public sector (Higginbotham, 1994; OECD, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Most studies of occupational sex segregation, the concentration of workers in pre-
dominantly same sex occupations, have been conducted at the national level and limited 
research exists on patterns of cross-national variation (Charles, 1992; Jacobs &amp; Lim, 
1992; Nermo, 1996). Interestingly, levels of segregation are generally lower in some 
relatively traditional countries, such as Japan and Italy, and higher in the more progres-
sive Scandanavian countries. Charles (1992) argues that this pattern results primarily 
from the large service sector in modern economies that is associated with higher rates of 
female labor force participation but greater female concentration in the highly gender 
segregated clerical, sales, and service occupations. Other studies (Jacobs &amp; Lim, 1992; 
Lorence, 1992; Nermo, 1996; OECD, 1994) shed doubt on this relationship in recent 
decades because they show that sex segregation has decreased somewhat in many indus-</p>

<p>trial countries with large service sectors, especially the United States, Canada, and the 
United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p>Occupational integration occurs for differing reasons across industrial nations. Haavio-
Mannila (1989), for example, found that in Eastern Europe occupational integration re-
sults primarily from women's work in traditional men's occupations in industry whereas 
in Southern Europe it results from men's work in traditional women's occupations of 
sales and private service work. Jacobs and Lim (1992) argue that it is more common for 
occupational integration to occur by men gaining access to women's occupations than 
vice versa. They found that during the period 1960-1980, with the exceptions of Austria 
and Greece, men experienced an increased chance of sharing an occupation with women 
in industrial countries, while women were more likely to experience a decline in the 
chances of sharing an occupation with men in all industrial nations but Greece. 
</p>
<p>In the United States, segregated employment patterns are of interest to sociologists 
primarily due to their association with the gender gap in wages. Studies examining the 
segregation-wage gap relationship across countries, however, often fail to provide sup-
port for the relationship. Rosenfeld and Kalleberg (1990) find no relationship in their 
study of four countries and Blau and Ferber (1986) find only a weak negative effect of 
segregation on the gender gap in wages in their study of 10 countries. Nermo (1992) also 
finds no straightforward relationship between segregation and the male-female wage gap 
in a study of Sweden. 
</p>
<p>2.4. Unemployment 
</p>
<p>The gap between the unemployment rates of women and men is a commonly used 
indicator of gender inequality in the labor market (OECD, 1994). It is important to note, 
however, that variations in unemployment data may in some cases reflect varying na-
tional policies that create incentives or disincentives for women to register as unem-
ployed (Evers &amp; Wintersberger, 1990; Grahl &amp; Teague, 1989). Differential rates of long-
term unemployment also make the interpretation of unemployment data across nations 
problematic, in that some nations have larger pools of discouraged workers who no longer 
seek work and are thus not counted in official unemployment statistics. 
</p>
<p>While there is considerable variation among countries in both levels of unemploy-
ment and relative levels of male and female unemployment (Baden, 1993), most nations 
experienced increases in unemployment for both sexes over the period 1979 to 1989 
(OECD, 1994). Unemployment data from the 1970s and 1980s suggest that female un-
employment is less sensitive to economic cycles than male unemployment, particularly in 
European nations (OECD, 1984). This is due largely to the sectoral distribution of em-
ployment by gender, specifically to women's concentration in service sector, public sec-
tor, and part-time employment. These forms of employment are less responsive to busi-
ness fluctuations than other employment categories dominated by men (De Boer &amp; Seeborg, 
1989; OECD, 1984). 
</p>
<p>Women in the following countries had higher rates of unemployment than men in 
1990-1991: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Nether-
lands, and Spain. The largest unemployment gaps favoring men were in Mediterranean 
countries&mdash;Spain (11.5%), Italy (9.8%), and Greece (7.4%). In all other industrial na-
tions where women have higher rates of unemployment than men, the gap is around five 
percentage points or smaller (ILO, 1992). A gender difference exists in the distribution of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Paid Work in Industrial Nations 331 
</p>
<p>the unemployed between the categories, "job search after non- participation" and "job 
search after loss of employment." Women are overrepresented in the first category and 
underrepresented in the second (OECD, 1994), suggesting that women have difficulty 
reentering the labor force in many nations after taking time out for family responsibili-
ties. 
</p>
<p>3. GENDER AND WORK INPUTS 
</p>
<p>A major theme in the literature on gender and employment involves the comparison of 
women and men in terms of worker inputs&mdash;for example, education, hours worked, ab-
senteeism, work values, and commitment (Abbott, 1993). This focus reflects the influ-
ence of the neoclassical economic paradigm and related human capital perspectives, which 
link work outcomes (e.g., earnings, occupational attainment) to the productivity-related 
characteristics of individual workers (Acker, 1992). These theories deemphasize the role 
of structural factors, such as characteristics of firms and markets, in the determination of 
work outcomes. However, the empirical literature assessing the importance of gender 
patterning in worker inputs explains a relatively small amount, and never more than 
50%, of the variation in earnings and occupational attainment (see, e.g., Corcoran, Duncan, 
&amp; Ponza, 1984; Polachek, 1981). Finding limited support for the importance of produc-
tivity-related differences between the sexes, these studies commonly attribute the unex-
plained variation to structural variables, including characteristics of firms and markets, 
and to discriminatory forces (Coverman, 1988). 
</p>
<p>Because empirical evidence suggests the somewhat limited importance of gender 
differences in quantifiable worker inputs for determining work outcomes, recent atten-
tion has turned to the examination of hypothesized gender differences in worker inputs 
that are less quantifiable, such as differences in work values and commitment (Agassi, 
1982; Elizur, 1993; Lorence, 1987a; Mannheim, 1993; Rowe &amp; Snizek, 1995; Siegfried, 
MacFarlane, Graham, Moore, &amp; Young, 1981); work styles including communication 
(Booth, 1991; Fairhurst, 1985; Lakoff, 1975; Noble, 1995; Reardon, 1997; Tannen, 1995); 
and leadership/management styles (Colwill, 1993; Court, 1997; Dobbins &amp; Platz, 1986; 
Rosener, 1990). This change in focus is also due to the fact that the sexes have begun to 
converge with respect to a number of more quanitifiable productivity-related characteris-
tics. Education provides one example in that women's overall educational attainment 
equals or surpasses men's in many industrial nations today (OECD, 1994). Patterned 
differences, however, still do exist between men and women workers in terms of type of 
education, and empirical evidence suggests that these differences impact work outcomes. 
For example, sex differences in college major have been shown to have a significant 
impact on earnings and occupational attainment (Eide, 1994; Fuller &amp; Schoenberger, 
1991; Gerhart, 1990; Jacobs, 1996). The following sections provide a brief overview of 
recent literature addressing gender differences in worker inputs in the two areas listed 
previously. 
</p>
<p>3.1. Gender, Work Commitment, and Work Values 
</p>
<p>Two distinct sources of gender differences in both work commitment and work values are 
posited in the literature. The gender socialization approach suggests that women are less </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>332 Dana Dunn AND Sheryl Skaggs 
</p>
<p>committed than men to paid work and that they bring different values to the workplace 
because of their earlier gender training (Giele, 1988). This perspective also often empha-
sizes women's needs to allocate time and energy to both job and family roles, and the 
impact of gender roles on such choices (Moen &amp; Smith, 1986). The second perspective 
views women's and men's differential status in the job market as responsible for commit-
ment and value differences. Sex differences in opportunities for mobility and rewards, in 
particular, are seen as fostering differing values and levels of commitment for women and 
men (Lincoln &amp; Kalleberg, 1990; Marsden, Kalleberg, &amp; Cook, 1993). Empirical evi-
dence suggests that both gender socialization and job characteristics contribute to gender 
differences in work values and commitment (Mannheim, 1993), but that characteristics 
of work may be more important in that women are less likely than men to hold jobs 
with commitment-enhancing features (e.g., opportunities for advancement and higher 
levels of other rewards) (Kanter, 1977; Lorence, 1987b; Loscocco, 1990; Marsden et al., 
1993). 
</p>
<p>Research on gender differences in work values typically distinguishes between in-
trinsic and extrinsic aspects of jobs. This distinction involves valuing work in terms of its 
interest level and the opportunities it provides for growth and actualization versus valu-
ing it because of material rewards, security, social relationships, or recognition. Studies 
show that women value the former aspects of work more than men, and that the sexes 
value different aspects of the latter&mdash;men emphasize material rewards and recognition 
and women emphasize interpersonal factors (Lueptow, 1980; Neil &amp; Snizek, 1987). Re-
cent studies show some convergence between the sexes in work values, but the differences 
that do emerge are still consistent with this pattern (Betz &amp; O'Connell, 1989; Lueptow, 
1996; Neil &amp; Snizek, 1987). 
</p>
<p>The majority of studies addressing gender differences in work values and commit-
ment are conducted with data from only one nation, the United States. One exception, a 
study by Elizur (1993), compares gender differences in work values for Hungary, Israel, 
and the Netherlands. Some values were ranked higher by men in one sample and by 
women in another. Personal growth, for example was ranked higher by Hungarian men 
than women, and higher by Dutch and Israeli women than men. Findings also indicated 
that gender differences in values among workers within a given nation were relatively 
small compared to differences across nations, suggesting that work values are culturally 
bound. Gender variation in work values and commitment across nations may be due to 
either differential gender socialization across nations or to differing work experiences 
and opportunities for women and men across nations. In a study of workers in Israel, 
Mannheim (1993) finds support for the socialization model, in that country of origin 
affected women worker's levels of work commitment. 
</p>
<p>3.2. Gender Differences in Management and Communication Styles 
</p>
<p>In the late 1980s and 1990s, sociologists joined in the debate over the existence of gender 
</p>
<p>differences in "styles" of managing and communicating (Noble, 1995). Two popular books. 
</p>
<p>The Female Advantage by Helgesen (1990) and Talking 9 to 5 by Tannen (1995), spurred 
</p>
<p>sociological inquiry into the existence, causes, and consequences of possible gender dif-
</p>
<p>ferences. As is the case with research on gender differences in work commitment and 
</p>
<p>values, both individualistic and structural explanations have been offered for sex-linked 
</p>
<p>differences in workplace communication and leadership. Individualistic explanations fo-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Paid Work in Industrial Nations 333 
</p>
<p>cus on the role of gender socialization in creating differences between women and men 
(e.g., men are taught to be assertive; women are taught to be conciliatory); structural 
explanations claim that the structure of work organizations and the location of the sexes 
within them (e.g., the proportion of women in the work position, hierarchical manage-
ment structures) result in different work "styles" for women and men (Dunn, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Structural explanations receive the most attention from sociologists, following the 
influential work of Kanter (1977), who focused attention on the impact of organizational 
structure on women's work experiences. According to the structural perspective, the fact 
that women managers are disproportionately located in lower level positions lacking in 
authority causes them to rely on more cooperative approaches to leadership. Put simply, 
women with limited organizational resources to back up their power cannot successfully 
issue directives and orders (what some call a male-oriented management style); instead, 
they must enlist the cooperation and support of subordinates in order to gain their com-
pliance (Colwill, 1993). 
</p>
<p>The primary gender difference in management style posited by those scholars who 
advocate difference involves women's emphasis on collaboration, teamwork, and partici-
pation (Marshall, 1984; Shakeshaft, 1989). Rosenser's (1990) study of 456 women ex-
ecutives, for example, found that women preferred to manage interactively, sharing power 
and information and empowering subordinates. Some scholars (Epstein, 1991; Powell, 
1990; Sonnenfeld, 1991) caution that a range of leadership styles exist for both sexes, and 
suggest that within-group variation may be as great as between-group variation. These 
two distinct views are captured in the equity and complementary contribution models of 
women in management (Adler &amp; Israeli, 1988). The former model, most pervasive in the 
United States, assumes similarity between the sexes and views difference as problematic; 
the latter, more visible in Europe and Scandanavia, assumes and values difference. The 
two models measure women's progress in management in quite different ways. The eq-
uity model focuses on quantitative measures of women's movement into management, 
arguing that as women's numerical representation increases, any structurally induced 
differences between the sexes in management styles will erode. The complementary con-
tribution model views progress in terms of qualitative assessments of organizations' ac-
ceptance of female styles of managing, suggesting a need for changes in organizational 
culture and values (Adler &amp; Israeli, 1988). 
</p>
<p>Somewhat less visible than the literature on gender differences in management, the 
literature on workplace communication differences between the sexes is less divided about 
the existence of difference. Conversational analyses provide much evidence of gendered 
patterns, including men interrupting women more often, the greater use by women of tag 
questions and other linguistic conventions conveying reluctance to make assertions, and 
more attempts by women to involve the listener (Reardon, 1997; Tannen, 1995). Studies 
exploring these gendered patterns often acknowledge that male-female interaction in the 
workplace negatively impacts women by causing them to be ignored, excluded, and/or 
patronized (Reardon, 1997). 
</p>
<p>In our opinion, while a range of work styles, including those characterized as both 
masculine and feminine, have the potential to enrich work organizations, the values that 
currently infuse the cultures of organizations do not often tolerate, much less value the 
female styles. Changing those values and the associated structures of opportunity is a 
difficult task. Similar issues are present in the literature on sex-based earnings differ-
ences and the value of jobs disproportionately held by women. These issues are addressed 
in the discussion of the wage gap and comparable worth. </p>

<p>4. GENDER AND WORK OUTCOMES 
</p>
<p>Sociological theory and research has addressed the relationship between gender and a 
number of work outcomes, including earnings (Marini, 1989; Rosenfeld &amp; Kalleberg, 
1990; Treiman &amp; Roos, 1983), prestige (Tyree &amp; Hicks, 1988; Xu &amp; Leffler, 1992), au-
thority (Mcguire &amp; Reskin, 1993; Reskin and Ross 1992; Wright, Baxter, and Birkelund 
1995), work satisfaction (Martin &amp; Sheehan, 1989; Neil &amp; Snizek, 1988), and mental 
and physical health (Stellman, 1977; Roxburgh, 1996). Of these workplace correlates of 
gender, earnings have received the most attention (Abbott, 1993). This emphasis reflects 
the ideas of early social theorists, such as Karl Marx (1967), who acknowledged the 
translatability of earnings into other valuable social rewards such as prestige and power. 
Space limitations prohibit thorough coverage in this chapter of all relevant gender-linked 
work outcomes. Because earnings differences between the sexes are also addressed in a 
later chapter, they receive only brief attention here. 
</p>
<p>4.1. Gender and Earnings 
</p>
<p>Women's nonagricultural wages in industrialized nations range between 63% and 
89&amp; of men's (see Table 15-6). Earnings ratios closer to equality are found in Nordic 
countries, nations classified by Rosenfeld and Kalleberg (1990) as "corporatist" because 
they have institutionalized centralized bargaining between the government, employers 
and labor. The gender gap in wages narrowed somewhat in many nations during the 
1960s and 1970s, although rates of change were variable between countries. In the 1980s, 
progress toward the equalization of earnings slowed in most countries, and actually re-

</p>
<p>versed in a few cases. Out of 15 industrial nations, the wage gap narrowed during the 
1980s in 5, increased in 9, and remained constant in 1 (ILO, 1994). In some countries the 
decline in women's earnings relative to men's resulted from changes in governmental 
wage policies, including wage hike ceilings, the decentralization of wage determination, 
and the privatization of state-owned companies (Bakker, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Until recent years, most research on the male-female wage gap was restricted to the 
United States, making it difficult to assess the impact on the wage gap of culturally dis-
tinct means of organizing work, family, and the state, and of coordinating these institu-
tions. Several explanations for the earnings gap have been posited in the sociological 
literature focused on the United States, including a human capital explanation (women 
do not compare favorably to men in terms of productivity-related characteristics such as 
education and experience); an explanation centered on women's coordination of work 
and family roles which suggests they tailor their work behavior to meet their family 
obligations; and an explanation focused on occupational segregation and the concentra-
tion of women in low-level and/or undervalued occupations (for a thorough review of 
these explanations and empirical tests of each see Marini, 1989). Each of these explana-
tions receives some support in the empirical literature on gender disparity in wages in the 
United States. Cross-national studies, however, find only limited support for these expla-
nations (Rosenfeld &amp; Kalleberg, 1990; Treiman &amp; Roos, 1983), pointing to the need for 
more comparative research. 
</p>
<p>One subtopic in the literature on gender and wages has received disproportionate 
attention in the United States: comparable worth (Abbott, 1993). Arguing that wage hier-
archies are not objectively determined on the basis of skill level, experience, and other 
relevant factors, but rather that the gender of the average incumbent of an occupation 
affects wages, writers on comparable worth both document this phenomenon and pre-
scribe remedies (England &amp; Dunn, 1988). Numerous studies show that a wage penalty 
exists for workers in female-dominated occupations, even after controlling for human 
capital and structural variables (Anderson &amp; Thomaskovic-Devey, 1995; England, 1992; 
Figart &amp; Lapidus, 1996; Reskin, 1993; Sorensen, 1994). Other studies examine systems 
of job evaluation and assess their effectiveness for eliminating the systematic undervalu-
ing of female-dominated jobs (Steinberg, 1990, 1992; Wajcman, 1991). Several book-
length case studies assess the intricacies of implementing pay equity policies designed to 
remedy gender-biased wage structures, exploring the political dynamics of various groups 
involved in the process&mdash;comparable worth advocates, employers, and unions (Acker, 
1989; Blum, 1991, Evans &amp; Nelson, 1989). 
</p>
<p>4.2. Gender, Occupational Prestige, and Workplace Authority 
</p>
<p>Occupational prestige and workplace authority are worker outcomes also shown to be 
</p>
<p>related to the gender composition of jobs. Occupational prestige, a subjective assessment 
</p>
<p>of the "status" of an occupation, is rather constant across nations (Treiman, 1977), yet 
</p>
<p>most studies linking prestige to gender are focused on the United States. One exception is 
</p>
<p>the work of Roos (1985), which examines the effects of gender, family background, edu-
</p>
<p>cation, and marital status on occupational mobility in 12 industrial nations, using occu-
</p>
<p>pational prestige as one of four measures of occupational attainment. She finds that edu-
</p>
<p>cation is a particularly important determinant of occupational prestige for women; in 7 of 
</p>
<p>12 countries examined it is the only significant influence for women whereas age, social </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>336 Dana Dunn AND Sheryl Skaggs 
</p>
<p>origins, and marital status are also important in determining occupational prestige levels 
for men. Studies focused on the United States typically consider the effects of both gender 
and race on the prestige of occupations, and find that while female-dominated occupa-
tions receive less prestige than male-dominated occupations, race has a more powerful 
impact than gender on occupational prestige (Bose &amp; Rossi, 1983; Tyree &amp; Hicks, 1988; 
Xu &amp; Leffler, 1992). 
</p>
<p>Wright et al. (1995) document considerable variability in the gender gap in author-
ity across seven nations, with English-speaking nations exhibiting a smaller gap, 
Scandanavian countries a larger one, and Japan the largest. The researchers control for 
compositional differences among women and men workers, and find that a gender gap in 
authority still remains in all seven nations; thus, they attribute a significant proportion of 
the gender differences in authority to direct discrimination. Studies focused on the United 
(1992), for example, found that net of human capital variables, type of employer, and 
organizational level, women have less workplace authority than men. 
</p>
<p>4.3. Gender and Worker Satisfaction 
</p>
<p>Despite the inferior work conditions women experience (e.g., lower pay, prestige, and 
authority), they often report greater levels of job satisfaction than men (Hodson, 1989, 
Murray &amp; Atkinson, 1981). This counterintuitive finding is thought to result primarily 
from women's lower expectations about work rewards and the reference groups to which 
they compare themselves (Hodson, 1989). Gender socialization and a lowering of expec-
tations based on knowledge of gender inequity in work rewards may explain why women 
have lower expectations than men about the rewards they derive from work. Classic theo-
ries of job satisfaction suggest that it is the matching of a workers' expectations to what 
the job offers that determines levels of job satisfaction (Gruneberg, 1979); thus, women's 
lower expectations make it easier for them to be satisfied with their work. 
</p>
<p>Expectations are also derived from comparisons with reference groups. To the extent 
that workers are more likely to conduct same than other-sex comparisons when apprais-
ing their jobs, gender inequities that might otherwise compel women to be dissatisfied 
are obscured. Andrisani (1978) suggests that one result of women's movement activity 
may be to encourage cross-sex comparisons between workers, which will likely generate 
lower overall levels of job satisfaction for women. Gender socialization has also been 
posited as inhibiting women workers' expression of discontent, suggesting that actual 
levels of dissatisfaction for employed women may be higher than survey findings indicate 
(Glenn &amp; Feldberg, 1977). 
</p>
<p>4.4. Gender, Work and Health 
</p>
<p>The early literature on women, work, and health focused primarily on pregnancy and 
</p>
<p>reproductive hazards for women in the workplace and generally neglected the broader 
</p>
<p>health concerns of women workers (Stellman, 1977). More recent sociological examina-
</p>
<p>tion of the topic has emphasized gender differences in distress among paid workers, ac-
</p>
<p>knowledging the linkage between stress and mental and physical health. A number of 
</p>
<p>studies show higher rates of distress for women workers than men (Menaghan, 1989; </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Paid Work in Industrial Nations 337 
</p>
<p>Roxburgh, 1996), despite findings that employed women enjoy better mental health than 
nonemployed women (Cleary &amp; Mechanic, 1983). 
</p>
<p>Two competing explanations for gender differences in distress have emerged&mdash;the 
differential vulnerability model and the differential exposure model (Roxburgh, 1996). 
The former model suggests that gender socialization causes women to experience the 
same workplace events as more stressful than do men. The latter argues that women are 
exposed to more stress producing circumstances in the workplace (e.g., a combination of 
high responsibility and low authority) (Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990), and that these stres-
sors may be exacerbated by conflicts between work and family roles (Ulbrich, 1989). 
Empirical research provides mixed support for both models. For example. Turner, Wheaton, 
and Lloyd (1995) find that while gender differences in exposure to stress account for a 
considerable proportion of the variance in men's and women's distress levels, vulnerabil-
ity differences account for more than 50% of the differences. One factor complicating 
research on gender differences in distress is the fact that women who are vulnerable to job 
stressors are more likely than men to select themselves out of the labor market or out of 
full-time employment (Roxburgh, 1996). 
</p>
<p>5. CONCLUSION 
</p>
<p>This chapter provides an overview of the major sociological literature on gender and 
work in industrial nations for three broad topical areas: patterns and rates of labor force 
participation, worker inputs, and worker outcomes. The recent proliferation of scholar-
ship on these and other topics related to gender and work made it necessary to circum-
scribe coverage; thus, many relevant topics are not addressed. For example, a sizable 
literature on gender and particular occupations exists, both comparing women and men 
in the same occupations and examining differences among women in specific jobs. The 
range of studies is as broad as the spectrum of occupations, running the gamut from high-
status professions such as medicine and law to clerical and lower-tier service sector occu-
pations. Employing a mix of both qualitative and quantitative research methods, these 
studies both enrich our understanding of particular occupations and provide insight into 
the variable impact of gender on work experiences. Other topics also not addressed in this 
chapter include gender and technology in the workplace; gender, unions, and labor rela-
tions; and workplace harassment. 
</p>
<p>Despite the breadth of topics and the extensive scholarship on gender and work, 
comparative research on many topics is still quite limited. Recent years have seen an 
increase in cross-national research on gender and work, but more scholarship is needed 
to reconcile the varied findings of country-specific studies. Many characteristics of na-
tions influence the relationship between gender and work&mdash;governmental structures, laws, 
social policies, cultural belief systems, location in the global economy, and history. Com-
parative research is required to understand better their role in shaping women's and 
men's work experiences and opportunities. Data comparability problems have tradition-
ally limited researchers' ability to generate cross-national studies; fortunately, coordi-
nated data collection efforts across nations and improvements in data collection and reporting 
techniques are occurring. This, combined with increased attention by sociologists to com-
parative research, bodes well for the future development of this important scholarship.

<p>dustrial nations, fueling the need for continued research on gender and work (Acker, 
1992). As increased international competition slows economic growth, economic reform 
is undertaken to enhance private sector profitability and competitiveness. These reforms 
include policies focused on lowering inflation, increasing labor market flexibility, de-
regulation, and industrial restructuring. These trends need to be assessed and continually 
monitored to determine whether women and men workers are differentially affected by 
them. For example, there has been little research examining whether women have been 
more negatively affected than men by privatization and the contracting out of public 
sector services in many industrial nations (United Nations, 1995a). 
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the proliferating scholarship on gender and work is justified for the 
many reasons described in the beginning of this chapter and should continue into the 
future. Much has been learned about gender and work over the last several decades; much 
remains to be learned. Documenting gendered patterns in the workplace and exploring 
the causes of gender inequities are necessary steps toward providing remedies.

<p>CHAPTER 16

<p>Sex, Race, and Ethnic Inequality 
</p>
<p>in United States Workplaces 
</p>
<p>BARBARA F. RESKIN 
</p>
<p>IRENE PADAVIC 
</p>
<p>The last third of twentieth century witnessed revolutionary reductions in sex and race 
inequality in the workplace. At the beginning of the 1960s, employers legally could refuse 
to hire people, assign them to jobs, and set their pay on the basis of their sex and race. The 
first signs of change were already present: married women had begun to catch up with 
their single sisters in their participation in the labor force, and African-Americans with 
their migration North were also pursuing different kinds of work from when they were in 
the South, especially women who were abandoning domestic work as other opportunities 
opened to them. But it took the Civil Rights Movement of the early 1960s, the Women's 
Liberation Movement of the late 1960s, and a series of federal and state laws to challenge 
the race and sex discrimination that were customary in the United States. 
</p>
<p>As we will see in this chapter, sex, race, and ethnic inequality persist in the kinds of 
paid work that people do, their advancement opportunities, and their earnings. We shall 
also see, however, indications of the erosion of these forms of inequality since 1970. We 
focus on two forms of employment inequality: the differential distribution of workers 
across occupations and jobs based on their sex, race, and ethnicity, and pay disparities 
associated with these characteristics. In a departure from most research, we consider 
three important bases of inequality: sex, race, and ethnicity. Although workers' sex, race, 
and ethnicity jointly affect their work experiences, few quantitative studies have simulta-
neously considered both sex and race, and only a handful of studies have examined the

</p>
<p>joint effects of sex, race, and ethnicity (see Reskin &amp; Charles, 1997).' Within the con-
straints of the available research, we discuss the extent and causes of sex, race, and ethnic 
inequality in the workplace. 
</p>
<p>1. JOB SEGREGATION BY SEX, RACE, AND ETHNICITY 
</p>
<p>Workers are not distributed across jobs based solely on their qualifications and interests; 
their sex, race, and ethnicity exert strong effects on the industries and occupations in 
which they work and thus the jobs they hold.^ Job segregation is the linchpin in work-
place inequality because the relegation of different groups to different kinds of work both 
facilitates and legitimates unequal treatment. Segregation facilitates unequal treatment 
in part because the jobs to which women and people of color are assigned are inherently 
less desirable than those open to white Anglo men. In addition, jobs that are filled pre-
dominantly by women and perhaps by minorities are devalued because society devalues 
women and minorities. Segregation legitimates unequal treatment because both U.S. val-
ues and the law permit unequal pay for different work. For these reasons, segregation 
generates pay and status disparities between persons of different sexes and races. 
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, Asians, African-Americans, and white 
women were confined to a limited number of occupations. A straightforward indicator of 
the degree to which workers are segregated based on some characteristic is the index of 
segregation (Duncan &amp; Duncan, 1955). The value of this index, which ranges from 0 to 
100, indicates the proportion of one of two groups that would have to change to an occu-
pation in which that group is underrepresented for the two groups to be identically dis-
tributed across occupations. As Fig. 16-1 shows, between 1900 and 1970, the index of 
occupational segregation hovered around 70 for women and men (Gross, 1968). In fact, 
the sexes and races were so segregated that until 1940 the U.S. Census Bureau treated 
census returns with atypical worker-occupation combinations, such as female train engi-
neer, as errors (Conk, 1981, p. 69).^ Sex and race discrimination gave white men a 
semimonopoly over most technical, managerial, and professional jobs until the middle 
19608." Race discrimination confined most blacks to menial agricultural and service jobs, 
and custom and law closed all but a handful of occupations to women.^ 
</p>
<p>After 1940, however, the occupational race segregation index declined among both 
sexes, from 44 to 24 for men and from 65 to 22 for women. Race segregation began 
declining at this time because the labor shortage brought on by World War II forced 
factories to hire blacks. The effect of these new opportunities was revolutionary for black 
</p>
<p>' Space limitations and limitations in available research preclude our considering other factors that influence workplace 
</p>
<p>outcomes, such as social class, sexual orientation, or disability. 
</p>
<p>^ An occupation is a collection of jobs involving similar activities within or across establishments (Bielby &amp; Baron, 
</p>
<p>1986, p. 764). The 1990 census distinguished 503 detailed occupations. In contrast, ajob is a specified position in 
</p>
<p>an establishment in which workers perform particular activities (Bielby &amp; Baron, 1986, p. 764). The Dictionary 
</p>
<p>of Occupational Titles (U.S. Department of Labor, 1977) distinguishes more than 20,000 jobs. 
</p>
<p>' The Census Bureau instructed its coders in 1930, for example, to "look up any occupations which involve 
</p>
<p>responsibility and high standing in the community, if the person is colored, Chinese, Japanese, or other" (quoted in 
</p>
<p>Conk, 1981, p. 68). 
</p>
<p>'' Exceptions were teaching, nursing, and social work for white women, and professsional jobs serving black clientele 
</p>
<p>for blacks. 
</p>
<p>' Among the occupations that some state laws closed to women were bartending and street car conductor. </p>

<p>the 1970s, sex segregation also began declining. About one quarter of the drop in the

<p>ters resulted as women began integrating customarily male occupations, such as manager 
</p>
<p>(Spain &amp; Bianchi, 1996, Table 4.6). As a result, between 1970 and 1990 the index of 
</p>
<p>occupational sex segregation fell from 67 to 53 (50.5 for blacks, 53.6 for whites, and 52.7 
</p>
<p>for Hispanics; Jacobs, 1989a; Reskin, 1994; additional computations from U.S. Bureau of 
</p>
<p>the Census, 1992a). In 1990, to fully sex-integrate occupations would have required that 
</p>
<p>53% of all female workers&mdash;more than 32 million persons&mdash;shift to mostly male occupa-
</p>

<p>tions. Eliminating segregation among whites would have required that 25% of Asians 
(29% of men and 21% of women), 26.5% of African-Americans (28% of men and 25% of 
women), and 27% of Hispanics (29% of men and 24% of women) change occupations 
(Reskin, 1994; additional computations from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992a). To elimi-
nate both sex and race segregation across occupations in 1990 would have required 60% 
of black women, 58% of Hispanic women, 53% of white women, and 30% of black and 
Hispanic men to shift to occupations in which white men predominated. Asians tend to be 
less segregated from same-sex whites than are blacks (Reskin, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Interpreting segregation indices as the proportion of members of a sex/race group 
that would have to change occupations is a convenient way of summarizing the extent of 
occupational segregation, but in reality such shifts would take generations under the best 
of conditions. In 1990, for example, almost 14 million black and white women&mdash;about 
one fifth of these women&mdash;held administrative-support occupations (in other words, they 
did clerical work) compared to 8% of black men and 5% of white men, while almost 19% 
of white men and 14% of black men held skilled blue-collar jobs, compared to 2% of both 
white and black women (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1997, Table 10). To bring women's 
representation in administrative-support and skilled blue-collar occupations in line with 
that of white men would have meant the transfer of more than 10 million female clerical 
workers to skilled blue-collar occupations. 
</p>
<p>Regardless of their race, most women work in predominantly female occupations. 
Of the 57 million women in the labor force in 1990, one third worked in just 10 of the 503 
detailed occupations (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1996a),' and only one woman in 
nine pursued an occupation that was at least 75% male (Kraut &amp; Luna, 1992, p. 3). Men 
likewise remain concentrated in predominately male occupations: one quarter of the 69 
million men in the labor force worked in just 10 occupations in 1990. Only two occupa-
tions appeared on both sex's top 10 list: "manager or administrator, not elsewhere classi-
fied" and "sales supervisor or proprietor" (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1996a), and 
these two heterogeneous categories conceal substantial job-level sex segregation. The 
large number of women working as managers, administrators, sales supervisors, and 
proprietors are disproportionately white. Neither manager or administrator (not elsewhere 
classified), nor sales supervisor or proprietor was among the five largest occupations for 
black women or Latinas (or Latinos) in 1995 (see Table 16-1). Except for black female 
nurses, none of the occupations that employed large numbers of Hispanic or black women 
or men were professional or managerial.* Black women were overrepresented in just a 
few professional occupations&mdash;dietitian, educational or vocational counselor, and social 
worker in 1995 (computed from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1996a). Hispanic men 
and women were underrepresented in all professions (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1996b, 
Table 637). Most of the top five occupations for black and Hispanic women and men 
involved cleaning or personal service (maid, private household servant, janitor, cook, 
gardener, nursing aide); a few involved unskilled labor (farm worker, laborer; see Table 
16-1). 
</p>
<p>Ethnicity also affects workers' occupational outcomes. For example, Filipina, Ameri-
</p>
<p>' The most common lines of work for women in 1990 are all but identical to those that employed the most women 
</p>
<p>in 1940. The only recent addition to women's top 10 occupations is the census category "miscellaneous salaried 
</p>
<p>managers." 
</p>
<p>* African-American female professionals were concentrated in two customarily female professions&mdash;nursing and 
</p>
<p>elementary school teaching (computed from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1995), Asian-American women were 
</p>
<p>concentrated in only one profession&mdash;accounting. </p>

</p>
<p>The top three occupations for Mexican and Central American women and for Puerto

<p>Rican, Mexican, and Southeast Asian men included janitor (the second largest occupa-

<p>tion for black men). Cook was among the top three occupations for Japanese, Chinese, 
</p>
<p>Filipino, Southeast Asian, and Central American men, as it was for black women (com-
</p>
<p>puted from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1996a).' All recent data on race and sex 
</p>
<p>workplace segregation are for occupations&mdash;a category that combines jobs involving similar 
</p>
<p>activities in the same and in different estabUshments (Bielby &amp; Baron, 1986, p. 764). 
</p>
<p>Thus, most nominally sex or racially integrated occupations include predominantly fe-
</p>
<p>male and male specialties (Bielby &amp; Baron, 1984). For example, although the occupation 
</p>
<p>of real estate sales has become sex integrated, women are concentrated in residential 
</p>
<p>sales, while men dominate the more lucrative commercial sales (Reskin &amp; Rocs, 1990). 
</p>
<p>Occupational specialties may be differentiated as well by workers' race and ethnicity. For 
</p>
<p>example, black workers tend to hold jobs in which they are more intensely supervised 
</p>
<p>than are white workers in the same occupation (Tomaskovic-Devey, 1993, p. 148). Often

<p>merits or even different parts of the country (Reskin, 1997c). Although declining occupa-
tional sex and race segregation signals some job-level integration, the extent of job segre-
gation far exceeds measured levels of occupational segregation (Peterson &amp; Morgan, 1995). 
In general, women and people of color&mdash;regardless of their sex&mdash;are underrepresented in 
desirable and lucrative jobs and disproportionately concentrated in low-status, low-pay-
ing service jobs. 
</p>
<p>1.1. Hierarchical Segregation 
</p>
<p>Because the desirability of the jobs in which group members are concentrated is posi-
tively correlated with the social status of the race/sex group, job segregation is often 
expressed hierarchically, with women and people of color concentrated in the lower ranks 
within occupations and organizations and white men dominating the top positions. Hier-
archical segregation&mdash;by which we mean the segregation of workers across different ranks 
in the same job (e.g., assistant manager versus manager)&mdash;consigns members of favored 
groups to jobs that are higher in occupational or organizational hierarchies and hence 
confer more status, authority, and pay. Thus, hierarchical segregation further exacerbates 
the earnings and authority gaps (McGuire &amp; Reskin, 1993; Reskin &amp; Ross, 1992).'&deg; Hier-
archical segregation&mdash;as expressed in the differential distribution of the races and sexes 
across vertical levels within organizations or occupations&mdash;includes both "glass ceilings" 
that exclude minorities and women from the top jobs in organizations and "sticky floors" 
that confine women and minorities&mdash;especially women of color&mdash;to low-ranking jobs 
(Berheide, 1992). A mere handful of minorities and women have reached the top of cor-
porate hierarchies. In 1990, only five of the 1000 CEOs listed in the Business Week 1000 
were nonwhite, and only 2.6% of senior managers in nine Fortune 500 companies that 
the U.S. Department of Labor studied were not white (Bell &amp; Nkomo, 1994). In 1995, 
only 57 (2.4%) of the 2430 top officers in Fortune 500 companies were women (Catalyst, 
1996). Other work settings show variations on this theme. In 1990, one in 11 partners in 
large law firms was female, compared to one in three associates (Epstein, 1993). Al-
though corporate sales offer a fast track to management, only one in seven saleswomen 
get beyond the level of district manager (Catalyst, 1996). While women held half of all 
federal government jobs in 1992, only one quarter of supervisors and only 10% of senior 
executives were women, and fewer than 2% of senior executives were minority women 
(U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, 1992, p. 33). Even in traditionally female occupa-
tions such as librarian or social worker, men advance more rapidly than women (Will-
iams, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Minorities' and women's representation in managerial jobs offers a summary indi-
cator of hierarchical segregation. Women and people of color remain underrepresented in 
management compared to white men, although the disparities have been shrinking since 
1970. In 1990, almost 13.1% of non-Hispanic white workers held managerial jobs (14.1% 
of men, 11.8% of women), compared to 12.3 percent of Asians and Pacific Islanders 
(13.4% of men, 11.1% of women), 7.9% of Native American groups (7.2% of men, 8.7% 
</p>
<p>" Even women in high-level positions seldom have as much authority as men at the same level (Reskin &amp; Ross, 
</p>
<p>1992). For example, McGuire and Reskin (1993) found that if black and female workers had received the same 
</p>
<p>authority returns to their experience and other credentials as white men, the authority gap with white men would 
</p>
<p>have shrunk by 62% for white women, 71 % for black women, and 93% for black men. </p>
<p/>

<p>of women), 7.3% of African-American workers (6.6% of men, 7.4% of women), and 
6.5% of Hispanics (6.2% of men, 7.0% of women; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992b, 
Table 2). Although the representation of African Americans has been increasing, as Fig. 
16-2 shows, African-American men's progress stalled during the 1980s, and by 1990 
African-American women were more likely to work in managerial occupations than Af-
rican-American men. 
</p>
<p>While the trends depicted in Fig. 16-2 show marked progress, we must remember 
that women and minorities tend to be low- rather than high-level managers. It is white 
male managers who usually have the final say in important decisions such as hiring, 
firing, promotions, raises, and issues that affect other units. A study comparing the sexes' 
roles in decision-making found that female mangers' input was more often to provide 
information or make recommendations while male managers more often made final deci-
sions (Reskin &amp; Ross, 1992). Indeed, other evidence indicates that women and minorities 
are ghettoized into less desirable managerial jobs that white men eschew (Collins, 1989, 
p. 329; Reskin &amp; McBrier, 1998). In addition, these and other findings suggest that some 
of women's and minorities' gains in managerial occupations represent "job-title infla-
tion"&mdash;managerial titles without managerial authority&mdash;in response to increased federal 
scrutiny (Smith &amp; Welch, 1984). 
</p>
<p>The patterns by sex and race in Fig. 16.2 depart from the tendency for the effect of 
sex to exceed that of race that holds for occupational segregation and therefore for earn-
ings. This departure probably reflects employers' practice of selecting managers of the 
same or a more highly esteemed sex and race than the workers who will be their subordi-
nates. 
</p>
<p>Group differences in promotion rates also indicate hierarchical segregation. In the 
early 1990s, whites were twice as likely as blacks to have been promoted and men were 
almost twice as likely as women to have been promoted, after taking into account educa-
tion, training, experience, and type of firm (Baldi &amp; McBrier, 1997; see also Kalleberg &amp; 
Reskin, 1995). In eight New York law firms, male associates were three times as likely as 
female associates to be promoted to partner (American Bar Association, 1996). In 1995, 
minority women were less likely to be promoted than white women with equivalent expe-
rience, although minority men in the federal government were promoted at the same rate 
as white men (U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, 1996). 
</p>
<p>1.2. Explaining Sex and Race Segregation 
</p>
<p>Workers' sex and race are linked to the kinds of jobs they do because of employers' and 
</p>
<p>workers' characteristics, preferences, and actions. However, some explanations for the 
</p>
<p>relationship between workers' ascriptive characteristics and their jobs differ for race and 
</p>
<p>sex. Explanations for segregation in general, and hierarchical segregation in particular, 
</p>
<p>emphasize workers' characteristics and preferences&mdash;"supply-side" explanations&mdash;by as-
</p>
<p>suming a two-step process: (1) people decide the kind of work they want to do, and (2) 
</p>
<p>they obtain the necessary credentials. These explanations treat getting a job in one's 
</p>
<p>preferred line of work as nonproblematic. Supply-side explanations for sex segregation 
</p>
<p>tend to stress the first step in this process&mdash;work preferences, whereas supply-side ex-
</p>
<p>planations for race segregation emphasize the second step&mdash;obtaining qualifications. We re-
</p>
<p>view supply-side explanations first for sex segregation and then for race segregation. We then 
</p>
<p>review explanations that emphasize employers' characteristics, preferences, and actions. </p>

</p>
<p>1.2.1. WORKERS' CHARACTERISTICS AND PREFERENCES. The sexes are concentrated 
</p>
<p>in different kinds of work, according to supply-side approaches, because women and men 
</p>
<p>prefer different kinds of jobs. Social scientists have proposed two reasons the sexes' pref-
</p>
<p>erences differ. According to a socialization perspective, men and women pursue different 
</p>
<p>kinds of jobs because gender-role socialization induces in them different life goals; in-
</p>
<p>stills in them different values regarding the importance of occupational success, autonomy, 
</p>
<p>or high earnings; teaches them different skills; fosters different personality traits; and 
</p>
<p>induces a distaste for sex-atypical activities and for working with members of the other 
</p>
<p>sex (Marini &amp; Brinton, 1984; see Chafetz, Chapter 1, this volume). To the extent that 
</p>
<p>gender-role socialization has these effects, the kinds of jobs that attract men should disin-
</p>
<p>terest women and vice versa. 
</p>
<p>Although gender-role socialization may incline young people toward jobs that soci-
</p>
<p>ety labels as appropriate for their sex (Subich, Barrett, Doverspike, &amp; Alexander, 1989), 
</p>
<p>young people's occupational aspirations are both quite unstable and unrelated to the oc-
</p>
<p>cupations they hold as adults (Jacobs, 1989b). Moreover, adults&mdash;especially women&mdash; 
</p>
<p>move between predominantly female and predominantly male occupations (Jacobs, 1989b). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Inequality in United States Workplaces 351 
</p>
<p>Despite gender-role socialization&mdash;and readers must bear in mind that no systematic data 
compare the socialization of contemporary women and men&mdash;the sexes tend to value the 
same job rewards: good pay, autonomy, and prestige (Jencks, Perman, &amp; Rainwater, 1988; 
Marini, Fan, Finley, &amp; Beutel, 1996). With respect to vertical segregation, women are as 
likely as men to value promotions (Markham, Harlan, &amp; Hackett, 1987, p. 227). These 
and other findings suggest that early gender-role socialization is not an important cause 
of job segregation. Far more influential are the opportunities, social pressures, and social 
rewards workers face as adults (Reskin &amp; Hartmann,1986). 
</p>
<p>The neoclassical economic perspective, another supply-side approach, assumes that 
occupational preferences are sex differentiated as a result of women's and men's con-
scious decisions to maximize household well-being. Hypothetically, in response to their 
different roles in the sexual division of labor, men and women pursue different employ-
ment strategies. Men's role as primary breadwinner induces them to maximize their earn-
ings by pursuing jobs that pay well and reward experience and by maximizing the amount 
of time they spend doing paid work. Women's primary responsibility for homemaking 
and child-rearing and their recognition that their husbands will earn enough to adequately 
support the family hypothetically lead women to select jobs that are compatible with 
domestic duties, both in scheduling and ease of reentry after time out of the labor force 
(see, e.g., Polachek, 1981). If women can rely on economic support by their husbands, 
they can eschew lucrative jobs that require overtime, continuous labor force participa-
tion, and the exertion of considerable effort, thereby reducing conflict between paid and 
family work. In anticipation of their differential involvement in labor-market and family 
work, this approach also assumes that men invest in more education and training than 
women, making them more qualified for jobs that require skills. 
</p>
<p>Most research evidence is inconsistent with the neoclassical explanation of sex seg-
regation. First, researchers have found that single women are as likely as married women 
to work in predominantly female occupations (Reskin &amp; Hartmann, 1986, p.71-72). In 
any event, women who plan to leave the labor force to have children earn more in custom-
arily male than female jobs. Second, predominantly male and female occupations require 
similar levels of education and skills (England, Chassie, &amp; McCormack, 1982), and most 
workers acquire their skills on the job. Contrary to the neoclassical theory, women are 
more likely than men to obtain training before employment (Amirault, 1992). Thus, there 
is little evidence that men's and women's concentration in different jobs results from 
their responses to their anticipated or actual family roles. The human-capital account of 
occupational sex segregation is problematic on other counts as well. If women place 
family responsibilities ahead of their careers, they should evidence less job commitment 
than men; yet women's commitment does not differ from men's (Marsden, Kalleberg, &amp; 
Cook, 1993). Women also expend as much energy on their jobs as men do (in fact, net of 
family responsibilities, women expend more effort on the job than men; Bielby &amp; Bielby, 
1988). Both sexes aspire to advance at work and will work hard for a promotion (Markham 
et al., 1987; Reskin &amp; Cassirer, 1996). Compared to 74% of male federal employees, 78% 
of women (and 86% of minority women) were willing to devote as much time as neces-
sary to advance in their career (U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, 1992)." Finally, the 
characteristics of predominantly female jobs are not especially compatible with stereo-
typical female domestic roles: jobs in predominantly female occupations are no more 
flexible, easier, or cleaner than those in predominantly male occupations (Glass, 1990, p. 
</p>
<p>'' The publication did not report the proportion of minority men who were willing to work hard for a promotion. </p>

cal explanation of sex segregation. First, women are more likely than men to work part-
time (in 1990, 22.4% of women and 7.6% of men worked part-time; computed from U.S. 
Bureau of the Census, 1992a), and part-time employment is associated with higher levels 
of occupational sex segregation. Second, sex differences in college majors are consistent 
with the neoclassical explanation (Jacobs, 1995). For example, women earned 47% of the 
bachelor's degrees in business administration in 1992, but only 34% of the master's de-
grees. Also, the greater workers' education, the less segregated the sexes are. In 1990, the 
index of sex segregation was considerably lower for college graduates than for high school 
graduates: 16.5 points lower for blacks and 18.5 points lower for whites (computed from 
U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992a; see also Jacobsen, 1997, p. 235). Nonetheless, we 
must be careful not to overstate the effect of education on sex segregation. Even among 
college graduates, the sex segregation index is 38 for blacks and 44 for whites. 
</p>
<p>The occupational preferences of men and women might differ for a reason unrelated 
to their domestic roles: people pursue jobs that they believe are available to them (Reskin 
&amp; Hartmann, 1986; Schultz, 1991, p. 141). Prospective workers do not apply for jobs 
unless they have reason to expect that they might be hired. Just as the sex-segregated 
help-wanted ads, common before the enactment of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 
steered workers into sex-typical lines of work, the sex and race composition of jobs signal 
would-be employees whether they have a reasonable chance of being hired and being 
accepted by co-workers. Minorities and women who are pioneers in occupations typically 
reserved for white men often encounter resistance&mdash;heckling, sabotage, and worse&mdash;by 
supervisors, co-workers, or customers (Bergmann &amp; Darity, 1981, Padavic, 1991a; 
Schroedel, 1985; Swerdlow, 1989; U.S. Department of Labor, 1996), contributing to the 
"revolving door" that returns women to sex-typical occupations (Jacobs, 1989b). When 
employers make customarily male jobs genuinely accessible to women and mostly white 
occupations accessible to minorities, the attractiveness of these jobs draws plenty of women 
and minorities (Reskin &amp; Hartmann, 1986; Reskin &amp; Roos, 1990). 
</p>
<p>The neoclassical approach to race segregation emphasizes workers' qualifications 
rather than their preferences. Blacks and Latinos/as have less education and job experi-
ence than whites (England, Christopher, &amp; Reid, 1997; Kilbourne, England, &amp; Heron, 
1994a, Table 1). Increasing parity in educational quality and quantity appear to have 
contributed to the occupational integration of black and white women between 1940 and 
1990 (King, 1992). For example, in 1990 the segregation index for black and white women 
was 10 points lower for college graduates than for high school graduates (King, 1992; 
additional computations from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992a). However, men's educa-
tional attainment had little effect on the extent of race segregation&mdash;the index of race 
segregation for male high school graduates was 28.2; for college graduates it was 25.4 
(computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992a). Also, 1990 census data indicate that 
race and ethnic differences in educational attainment&mdash;as well as nativity and English 
fluency&mdash;played only minor roles in occupational segregation by race and ethnicity (Reskin, 
1997a). 
</p>
<p>In sum, the neoclassical approach is consistent with white males' concentration in 
customarily male occupations and their underrepresentation in predominantly female 
occupations: white men&mdash;whose options are not limited by discrimination&mdash;pursue the 
most desirable jobs and eschew predominantly female jobs because they pay less and offer 
fewer opportunities for advancement. However, the value of neoclassical approach for 
explaining women's and minorities' concentration in some occupations and </p>

</p>
<p>underrepresentation in others is limited and largely inconsistent with our understanding 
of how workers get jobs.'^ 
</p>
<p>1.2.2. EMPLOYERS' PREFERENCES AND PRACTICES. A major reason women and mi-
norities are concentrated in different jobs than white men is because employers prefer 
persons of different sexes and races for different jobs. They do so because of their stereo-
types and biases and out of deference to their customers' or employees' biases. Employers 
also segregate workers as a result of superficially neutral employment practices. 
</p>
<p>One reason employers consider sex and race in filling jobs is out of loyalty to their 
own group&mdash;usually white men. Although little research has focused explicitly on the 
segregative effects of in-group preference, several studies suggest its importance for the 
degree of segregation in organizations. First, the sex and race of decision-makers affect 
their responses to members of their own group and other groups. For example, having a 
female agency head was associated with progress toward sex integration in California 
state agencies (Baron, Mittman, &amp; Newman, 1991). In addition, a review of more than 70 
studies found that evaluators rated same-race persons higher than other-race persons 
(Kraiger &amp; Ford, 1985). Second, the nepotism characteristic of small firms and some 
industries such as construction is, of course, for one's own group (Waldinger &amp; Bailey, 
1991), and its effect is segregative. Third, a shortage of white male workers is a major 
reason firms employ female and minority workers in customarily white-male occupations 
(Padavic &amp; Reskin, 1990; Reskin &amp; Roos, 1990). Fourth, by restricting cronyism&mdash;that 
is, in-group favoritism&mdash;formalized personnel practices appear to have reduced job seg-
regation (Dobbin, Sutton, Meyer, &amp; Scott, 1993). 
</p>
<p>According to several recent studies, race and sex stereotyping and bias contribute to 
sex segregation. For example, comparisons of the job-search outcomes of white-minority 
pairs in "audit" studies in four cities revealed that white men were substantially more 
likely to receive job offers than their minority matches (Fix &amp; Struyk, 1992).'^ Qualitative 
studies in several cities reveal the reasons for the patterns from the audit studies. Employ-
ers, most of whom are white men, frankly admit their reluctance to hire black workers 
based on their stereotypes of blacks as lazy, unintelligent, insubordinate, and prone to 
criminal acts (Bobo, 1996; Holzer, 1996; Kasinitz &amp; Rosenberg, 1996; Moss &amp; Tilly, 
1996; Neckerman &amp; Kirschenman, 1991; Smith, 1990; Wilson, 1996, Chapter 5). The 
refusal of some employers to hire minorities or their willingness to hire them for only 
menial jobs inevitably segregates the races. Stereotypes also restrict women's employ-
ment opportunities. Stereotyped as unable to do physically demanding jobs, lacking ca-
reer commitment, and disinterested in advancement (Bielby &amp; Baron, 1986; Fiske, Bersoff, 
Bogida, Deaux, &amp; Heilman, 1991; Reskin &amp; Padavic, 1988; Segura, 1992, p. 173; Will-
iams &amp; Best, 1986), women are excluded from rewarding white-collar and blue-collar 
jobs. 
</p>
<p>Sex and race stereotypes affect hiring and promotion decisions through statistical 
discrimination, a process in which employers impute to individuals stereotyped or actual 
attributes of the group to which the individual belongs to avoid the cost of screening 
applicants' qualifications (Bielby &amp; Baron, 1986; Braddock &amp; McPartland, 1987; Holzer, 
</p>
<p>^ Few job seekers have their choice of jobs; most receive only one or two offers and accept the first offer that meets 
</p>
<p>their minimum acceptable pay (Gera &amp; Hasan, 1982; Kahn, 1978). 
</p>
<p>' An audit of sex discrimination found that more expensive restaurants favored males as server, whereas cheaper 
</p>
<p>ones favored women (Newmark, Bank, &amp; Van Nort, 1995). </p>

</p>
<p>1996, pp. 83, 103; Messick &amp; Mackie, 1989; Williams &amp; Best, 1986). Employers' and 
supervisors' stereotypes also bias their evaluations of women and minorities, thus reduc-
ing their chances for promotion (Baron &amp; Bielby, 1985, p. 243; Eagly, Makhijani, &amp; 
Klonsky, 1992, p. 14; Fiske et al., 1991, p. 1050). Evaluation bias leads supervisors to 
evaluate whites and men more positively than equally qualified blacks and women 
(Greenhaus &amp; Parasuraman, 1993; Greenhaus, Parasuraman, &amp; Wormley, 1990, Table 1; 
Pulakos, White, Oppler, &amp; Borman, 1989; Sackett, Dubois, &amp; Noe, 1991, p. 265;), in part 
because they hold the latter groups to higher standards (Cox &amp; Nkomo, 1986).''* Hiring 
and promotion practices that rely on informal networks are highly subjective, and the 
more subjective the evaluation, the greater the risk of bias (Braddock &amp; McPartland, 
1987, p. 22; Deaux, 1984; Deaux, 1985; Eagly &amp; Wood, 1982; Pettigrew &amp; Martin 1987, 
pp. 55-58). Queuing models provide a theoretical approach to the effect of employers' 
race and sex preferences for workers&mdash;as expressed in their ordering of the labor queue 
(Lieberson, 1980, p. 296; Reskin &amp; Roos, 1990; Thurow, 1969, p. 48). According to a 
queuing approach to occupational segregation, the higher workers stand in labor queues, 
the greater their access to jobs near the top of job queues. As low-ranked groups, women 
and minorities obtain access to jobs usually filled with white men when those jobs be-
come less attractive to white men compared to their alternatives. This approach makes 
sense of the different distributions of the sexes and races across different industries and 
occupations. For example, white men are overrepresented in the private sector, the high-
est-paying sector, leaving public-sector and government jobs for women and minorities 
(historically the only place outside the black community where African-Americans could 
find work as managers and professionals; Higginbotham, 1987; U.S. Merit Systems Pro-
tection Board, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Regardless of their source&mdash;in-group preference, out-group antipathy, stereotypes, 
or biases&mdash;race and sex discrimination significantly restrict workers' options. The large 
number of formal complaints to antidiscrimination agencies, in combination with em-
ployers' candid reports of their stereotypes, suggest that discrimination is widespread: 
The federal government received more than 91,000 such complaints in 1994 (Leonard, 
1994, p. 24; U.S. Department of Labor, 1996)." When enforced, antidiscrimination laws, 
such as Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (which banned employment discrimination 
based on race, national origin, or sex) and affirmative action requirements for federal 
contractors, opened thousands of semiskilled and skilled blue- and white-collar jobs to 
black men and women (Burstein, 1979, 1985; Donohue &amp; Heckman, 1991; Heckman &amp; 
Payner, 1989; for a review, see Badgett &amp; Hartmann, 1995). Federal scrutiny helps to 
reduce sex and race segregation. The requirement by the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC; the agency charged with enforcing Title VII) that firms with at 
least 50 employees annually report employees' distribution across broad occupational 
categories by race and sex has been an incentive for employers to place more women and 
minorities in managerial and administrative jobs. Thus, in 1960, 2% of black women, 4% 
of black men, and 5.5% of white women worked in the broad occupation of managers; by 
1996, 9.6% of black women, 8.3% of black men, and 14% of white women were manag-
ers (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1961, 1997, Table 10). 
</p>
<p>Recent history shows that when the government enforces antidiscrimination and 
</p>
<p>''' Employers in the suburbs, who hire mostly white workers, have lower standards than those in the central city, who 
</p>
<p>draw more heavily on minorities (Holzer, 1996). 
</p>
<p>" Approximately 3% charged "reverse discrimination" (Bendick, 1996; Blumrosen, 1995). </p>

</p>
<p>affirmative-action regulations, minorities' and women's representation in sex- and race-
atypical occupations increases (Ashenfelter &amp; Heckman, 1976; Leonard, 1984a, b). More 
generally, sanctioning discriminating employers reduces job segregation (Badgett &amp; 
Hartmann, 1995; Martin, 1991; Leonard, 1994, p. 21; Reskin &amp; Roos, 1990). The un-
even enforcement of the affirmative action required of federal contractors by Presidential 
Executive Order 11246 (11374) provided a natural experiment. During the 1980s, when 
there was no presidential mandate to enforce the executive order, minorities were more 
poorly represented at federal contractors than at noncontractors (Leonard, 1994), sug-
gesting that federal contractors had reverted to the discriminatory practices that had 
prompted President Nixon to issue the executive order in the first place. Without the 
threat of governmental intervention, most employers do business as usual, which means 
making hiring and promotion decisions that are influenced by sex and race biases (Kern, 
1996; Leonard, 1994). 
</p>
<p>1.2.3. STRUCTURAL DISCRIMINATION. Employers' personnel practices&mdash;even those that 
seem to be race and gender neutral&mdash;nonetheless affect race and sex segregation in firms. 
The clearest example is filling jobs through referrals by current workers. This common 
recruiting practice perpetuates segregation because workers' social networks tend to be 
sex and race segregated (Marsden, 1994, p. 983). In contrast, open-recruitment tech-
niques, such as posting all job openings, can reduce segregation by allowing everyone to 
learn of sex- and race-atypical jobs. 
</p>
<p>Requiring credentials that are more common among white men than women and 
minorities also contributes to segregation. Sometimes segregation itself prevents women 
and minorities from acquiring qualifications. For example, the military's past exclusion 
of women from combat positions has blocked their advancement in military careers (Wil-
liams, 1989, p. 51). Analogously, blacks' exclusion from apprenticeship programs has 
kept them out of well-paying unionized craft jobs. Required credentials also can dispro-
portionately affect women and minorities because employers more frequently exempt white 
men than others from formal requirements (Baron &amp; Bielby, 1985, p. 243). 
</p>
<p>Pervasive sex segregation has prompted employers to organize work schedules and 
the labor process on the assumption that men will do some jobs and women will do 
others. The result can be barriers to women performing some customarily male jobs. For 
example, most machinery is designed to accommodate white, Anglo men. As a result, 
people who are shorter than the average white, Anglo man&mdash;including many women and 
some Latino and Asian men&mdash;cannot operate it safely or efficiently. Some companies 
design plant jobs so that workers rotate across different shifts&mdash;day, evening, and grave-
yard&mdash;which can discourage women from these jobs by making childcare arrangements 
difficult (Padavic, 1991b). 
</p>
<p>Segregated entry-level jobs maintain hierarchical segregation by disproportionately 
concentrating women and minorities in jobs with limited opportunity for mobility be-
cause they are on short ladders, restrict workers' opportunity to acquire skills, and lack 
visibility (Marsden, 1994, p. 983).'* Firms tend to employ female and minority managers 
in staff positions, such as personnel or pubUc relations, while male managers are concen-
</p>
<p>' Many employers adhere to what Bermann (1986, pp. 114-116) called an "informal segregation code" that prohibits 
</p>
<p>women from supervising men and reserves the training slots leading to higher-level jobs for men. Men rule over 
</p>
<p>women and junior men, women rule over women, but women rarely if ever rule over men. This code applies to 
</p>
<p>minorities as well: minorities may give orders to other minorities, but not to whites. </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>356 Barbara F. Reskin AND Irene Padavic 
</p>
<p>trated in organizationally central line positions, such as sales, finance, and production, 
from which senior managers are selected. Employers often assign African-Americans to 
positions that deal with other minorities, such as community relations or affirmative 
action, regardless of their areas of expertise (Collins, 1989, p. 329, 1997). While staff 
positions provide few opportunities for workers to display their abilities, complex and 
challenging line jobs give incumbents a chance to develop and display their skills, such 
as exercising authority, supervising subordinates, or dealing with difficult situations (Bell 
&amp; Nkomo, 1994, p. 39; Tomaskovic-Devey, 1994). Thus the segregation of minorities 
and women into nonchallenging jobs reduces their chances of being promoted by restrict-
ing their chances to acquire or demonstrate skills (Erdreich, Slavet, &amp; Amador, 1996, p. 
xiii). 
</p>
<p>Minorities' and women's relegation to dead-end or short-ladder jobs is critical for 
hierarchical segregation (Bell &amp; Nkomo, 1994, pp. 32, 39; Colhns, 1989, 1997). To im-
prove advancement opportunities for clerical and service workers, some companies have 
created "bridge" positions that help workers to switch job ladders&mdash;for example, move 
from a clerical job ladder to a production or administrative one&mdash;without risk or penalty 
(Kanter, 1976; Northrup &amp; Larson, 1979; Roos &amp; Reskin, 1984). Seniority systems can 
also affect the amount of hierarchical segregation in an organization (Kelley, 1984). For 
instance, USX (formerly U.S. Steel) helped to integrate customarily male production jobs 
by altering its seniority rules to allow workers to transfer to plant jobs without losing their 
seniority (Reskin &amp; Hartmann, 1986, p. 93; Ullman &amp; Deaux, 1981). Other case studies 
also demonstrate that organizations can eliminate structural barriers that exclude women 
and minorities from jobs (Badgett, 1995; Deaux &amp; Ullman, 1983; DiTomaso, 1993; 
Northrup &amp; Larson, 1979). 
</p>
<p>The segregation of women and men into different kinds of establishments also con-
tributes to hierarchical segregation. The sheer size of large organizations lets them create 
more opportunities to promote workers, and they are more likely to have job ladders 
(Kalleberg, Marsden, Knoke, &amp; Spaeth, 1996). Therefore, women's concentration in small, 
entrepreneurial firms and nonprofit organizations and men's concentration in large cor-
porations and for-profit companies reduce women's odds of promotion relative to men 
(Kalleberg &amp; Reskin, 1995). Some industries are better than others in promoting women. 
In female-intensive industries such as apparel, banking, retail trade, and insurance, women 
are more likely to be high-level managers (Shaeffer &amp; Lynton, 1979). For instance, in 
1990 women were only 2.2% of the officers in the chemicals industry, but 10% of the 
officers in the apparel industry. Although only five percent of the directors in the elec-
tronics industry were women in the late 1980s, almost 17% of the directors in the cosmet-
ics and soap industries were (Von Glinow, 1988). Why do women have greater access to 
high-level jobs in female-dominated industries? Jobs in female-intensive industries pay 
less and are thus less desirable to men. Furthermore, firms' experience with female work-
ers makes them less likely to stereotype women. 
</p>
<p>In sum, workplace segregation is largely due to employers' use of workers' sex, race, 
and ethnicity in assigning workers to jobs because of stereotypes and outright bias. Pres-
sure from regulatory agencies, internal constituencies, and the public has prompted some 
employers to reduce stereotyping and bias by replacing informal personnel practices, 
such as word-of-mouth hiring, with formal ones, such as advertising and posting all 
openings, reassessing the qualifications jobs require, and using objective criteria for hir-
ing and promotion (Roos &amp; Reskin 1984; Szafran, 1982). </p>

<p>357 
</p>
<p>White men outearn men of color and women from all racial and ethnic groups. In 1995, 
for example, Hispanic women employed full-time year round earned just 53% of what 
white men earned, Hispanic men earned 61%, black women earned 63%, white women 
earned 72%, and black men earned 74%. These disparities translate into a $14,994 pay 
gap with white men for the average Hispanic woman and a $7,744 gap for the average 
black man (Institute for Women's Policy Research [IWPR], 1996, Table 3). In general, 
the disparities between the earnings of white men and those of other groups have closed 
since 1970, as Fig. 16-3 shows. Black women show the most progress relative to white 
men. However, some reversals of some slopes from positive to negative indicate that 
gains are not necessarily permanent. Closest to earnings parity with white men were

</p>
<p>Asian men employed full-time year round; their median earnings were almost 98% of 
white men's in 1970 and 1990 (computed from Harrison &amp; Bennett, 1995, Table 4A.1). 
No other group achieved even three quarters of white men's 1990 earnings. 
</p>
<p>The trends in racial differences in earnings summarized above are disconcerting. 
Although the black-white earnings gap shrank between 1965 and 1975, black men's 
earnings relative to white men deteriorated between 1975 and the late 1980s (Bound &amp; 
Freeman, 1992), and by 1995 black men still had not regained their 1975 earnings rela-
tive to whites (see Fig. 16-3). Figure 16-3 also displays the substantial shortfall of female 
and male Hispanics' earnings relative to white men. The pay difference between Hispanic 
and white men widened by 15 percentage points between 1970 and 1995. Young black 
women's position relative to white women has been deteriorating since the early 1970s, 
especially among college graduates (Bound &amp; Dresser, 1997, Fig. 1). Although Hispanic 
women narrowed the gap with white men between 1975 and 1990, they have not contin-
ued to do so at the same rate. American Indian women, who earned a little more than half 
of what men made in 1990, have closed their earnings gap with white men by less than 
one percentage point per decade since 1970, and American Indian men, who earned three 
quarters of what white men made in 1990, were relatively worse off in 1990 than in 1970. 
</p>
<p>Sex differences dominate earnings inequality. In every racial group, men outearn 
women. The pay gap between women and men who worked full-time, year round did not 
start to close until 1975 when women earned 58.8% of what men made, the largest dis-
parity since 1920. Although the gap in the median earnings of men and women who 
worked full-time year round narrowed by more than 11 percentage points between 1975 
and 1995, in 1995 men who worked full-time year round still earned $1.40 for every 
dollar a woman earned (computed from IWPR, 1996, Table 1). Within broad race catego-
ries, the sex difference in annual earnings is greatest for whites ($9261) and Asians 
($8740; computation based on median income from Table 4A.1 in Harrison &amp; Bennett, 
1995), reflecting white and Asian men's high median earnings, and smallest for Hispan-
ics ($3201) and blacks ($3763), reflecting the low average earnings of Hispanic and 
black men (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1996a). American Indian women's 
shortfall relative to same-ethnicity men was intermediate: $5400 (computation based on 
median income from Table 4A.1 in Harrison &amp; Bennett, 1995). 
</p>
<p>2.1. Explaining Sex and Race Differences in Earnings 
</p>
<p>Explanations for sex and race disparities in earnings emphasize group differences in 
workers' education, experience, and jobs, as well as the earnings payoff for these factors. 
They include differences in (1) group characteristics that hypothetically affect workers' 
productivity; (2) group rewards for productivity-enhancing characteristics; (3) group dis-
tributions across occupations, industries, firms, and jobs; and (4) group payoffs for the 
same kind of work. A fifth explanation attributes part of the sex gap to sex differences in 
orientations toward monetary versus nonmonetary rewards. In the following sections we 
review the evidence for each of these explanations. 
</p>
<p>2.1.1. PRODUCTIVITY DIFFERENCES. To the extent that employers reward productivity, 
</p>
<p>differences by race and sex in productivity will give rise to pay differences across groups. 
</p>
<p>The difficulty of measuring productivity has led researchers to use as proxies for produc-</p>

</p>
<p>tivity the amount of time and effort workers spend at work and characteristics that hypo-
thetically increase workers' productivity, such as education and experience. 
</p>
<p>In general, men are employed more hours per year than women, because they work 
more hours per week and more weeks per year." Even among workers employed full-time 
year round, men averaged 3 hours more per week than women in the same broad racial 
group (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992a). Whites tend to work more 
hours per week than people of color, although this does not hold for Asian compared to 
white women and is a reversal from the past for African-American compared to white 
women (Farley, 1984, Table A.2).'* Whites work more weeks per year than same-sex 
Asians, Hispanics, or African-Americans (computed from U.S. Bureau of the Census, 
1992a)." Although the proportion of women employed full-time year round has been 
increasing since 1970 (Spain &amp; Bianchi, 1996, Table 84) and has helped to reduce the 
pay gap between the sexes, men's greater average number of hours of paid work per week 
explains a little of the sex gap in pay: the sexes' earnings ratio tends to be 2 to 4 percent-
age points closer to equity for hourly earnings than weekly earnings (Bianchi, 1995, p. 
129; IWPR, 1996, Table 1; Mishel &amp; Bernstein, 1994, p. 125). As Fig. 16-4 shows, in 
1995 the sex gap among full-time workers was smallest for hourly pay, slightly larger for 
weekly earnings, and slightly larger for annual earnings. The pattern in Fig. 16-4 for all 
workers varies by race. Although the sex gap in median earnings in 1995 was 12.6% 
larger for annual earnings than weekly earnings, the difference in weekly and annual 
earnings explained just 2.4% of the gap between Hispanic women and white men and 9% 
of the gap between white women and men. Black women's, black men's, and Hispanic 
men's gaps in weekly pay compared to white men are larger than their annual earnings 
gaps because white men average more hours (IWPR, 1996, Table 3; U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, 1996b, Table 37). 
</p>
<p>Differences in the extent of employment across groups are not solely a consequence 
of workers' preferences. Although some people deliberately limit their paid work in re-
sponse to other demands on their time, such as education and family, others cannot obtain 
as many hours of paid work as they want or need (Carnoy, 1994, p. 82). In 1995, for 
example, one in five part-timers (17.5% of women and 27.7% of men) could not find a 
full-time job (computed from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1996a). Thus, variation in 
the earnings gaps explained by group differences in extent of employment may not reflect 
group differences in preference for paid work time.

<p>" In 1990, all employed men averaged 6 hours more per week than all women (42.3 compared to 36.3 hours), and 
</p>
<p>they worked, on average, 2 more week per year (46.4 compared to 44.5), according to unpublished analyses of 
</p>
<p>the 1990 census data (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992a). The sex differences in hours was smallest among 
</p>
<p>African-Americans (2.8 hours per week) and largest among whites (6.6 hours). Hispanic and Asian men averaged 
</p>
<p>3.5 to 4 more hours per week than did same-race women. In terms of weeks per year, black men worked only .4 
</p>
<p>more weeks than black women, Hispanic and Asian men worked about 1.5 weeks more than same-race women, 
</p>
<p>and white men averaged 2.1 more weeks than white women,

<p>Inequality in United States Workplaces 361 
</p>
<p>Although group differences in effort could give rise to unequal pay, there is no evi-
dence that differences in work effort explain white men's higher pay. In fact, the few 
studies that compared the sexes suggest that women work at least as hard as do men 
(Bielby &amp; Bielby, 1988; Major, McFarlin, &amp; Gagnon, 1984); we found no similar studies 
by race. 
</p>
<p>Neoclassical economists assume that workers' education, training, and experience 
affect&mdash;and are thus proxies for&mdash;their productivity. If so, then sex and race differences 
in education or experience could explain part of the earnings gaps. Overall, women workers 
have one month less schooling than men, although the difference varies by race, with 
whites averaging the same number of years of schooling (13.3), Asian men averaging 
about a half a year more than Asian women (14.0 compared to 13.4), and African-Ameri-
can and Hispanic women averaging slightly more years schooling than their male coun-
terparts (black women average 12.7 years, black men 12.2, Hispanic women 11.3, and 
Hispanic men 10.5). On average, men are less likely than women to have completed high 
school and more likely than women to have postgraduate education (Bianchi, 1995). The 
sexes and races also tend to major in different subjects, but over the past 20 years, college 
majors have become more similar across sex and race categories (Jacobs, 1995), and 
women have been catching up with men in the likelihood of postgraduate education. 
According to O'Neill and Polachek (1993, p. 221), 17% of the dechning sex gap in pay 
between 1976 and 1989 resulted from the convergence in women's and men's years of 
schooling. However, by 1990, educational differences played a minor role at most in the 
earnings gap between young-to-middle-aged women and men (England, Reid, &amp; Kilbourne, 
1996: England et al., 1997, Table 7). 
</p>
<p>Race differences in education contribute to racial disparities in earnings, because 
blacks and Hispanics average less schooling than whites (Mare, 1995, p. 158).^' During 
the 1980s, whites pulled further ahead of blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians in 
college graduation (Harrison &amp; Bennett, 1995, Fig. 4.5). This difference&mdash;a consequence 
of past discrimination and an indicator of ongoing residential and economic disadvan-
tages of people of color&mdash;may contribute to whites' higher earnings, either by making 
whites more productive or because employers require degree completion for well-paying 
jobs. One way to assess the importance of race and sex differences in education on the 
earnings gap is to compare how much minorities' earnings would increase if they aver-
aged the same amount of education as white men. (Equalizing education with white men 
would not reduce the gap between white women and men because white females workers 
had as many years of education as white males in 1989.) Having white men's years of 
schooling would have raised black females'1989 earnings by 7 percentage points, black 
males' by 9 points, Latinas' by 13 points, and Latinos' by 19 points (Carnoy, 1994, Table 
4.6). Among workers who were 28 to 35 years old in 1993, schooling differences ex-
plained about one sixth of the race gap between black and white men, one eighth to one 
fifth of the gap between black and white women, three eighths to two thirds of the gap 
between white men and Latinos, and four fifths to 100% of the gap between white women 
and Latinas (England et al., 1997, Table 3). 
</p>
<p>Because college graduation strongly affects earnings, the growing black-white dis-
parity in college completion works against reducing race differences in earnings. Dis-
crimination in apprenticeship programs further inhibits minorities' representation in high-
</p>
<p>'̂ In 1990, blacks averaged 12.5 years of education and Hispanics averaged 10.8 years, compared to 13.3 years for 
</p>
<p>whites and 13.7 years for Asians (unpublished analysis, U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992a). </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>paying jobs (Waldinger &amp; Bailey, 1991). Minorities also tend to be underrepresented in 
occupations that allow them to acquire skills on the job. For example, people of color in 
contingent work are disproportionately concentrated in occupations that involve tasks 
that are less complex than those in which white men work; such jobs are less likely to 
provide the opportunity to acquire job skills that could lead to regular jobs (Reskin, 1997b). 
</p>
<p>Men average more job experience than women, although the difference has been 
declining. This convergence has contributed to the narrowing of the sex gap in pay (Mishel 
&amp; Bernstein, 1994, p. 119; O'Neill &amp; Polachek, 1993). The declining sex difference in 
work experience produces a positive association between workers' age and the size of the 
pay gap. In 1995, for example, the median weekly earnings of 25- to 29-year-old women 
employed full time was 80% of what same-age men earned, while 40- to 44-year-old 
women earned just 62% of male age peers' wages (IWPR, 1996, Table 6; see also O'Neill 
&amp; Polachek, 1993, Table 2)." Among mature workers surveyed between 1966 and 1988, 
experience accounted for one fourth to one third of the sex gap in earnings among Afri-
can-Americans and one third to one half of the sex gap for whites (Kilbourne et al., 
1994a). In contrast, among workers who were ages 14 to 22 in 1979, sex differences in 
experience explained just 1% of the gap among whites and 9% among blacks (England et 
al., 1996; see also England et al., 1997, Table 4 for race-specific results). 
</p>
<p>Race differences in experience&mdash;although small (Farley, 1984, Table A2)&mdash;contrib-
ute to the earnings gap among men. Among mature workers, race differences in experi-
ence explained two fifths of the gap between black and white men (England et al., 1996, 
Table 1). In the past, black women had more job experience, on average, than white 
women, but young white women are now more experienced than young black women 
(England et al., 1996, Table 1). Black women's declining years of experience relative to 
white women contributed to the increasing earnings gap with white women during the 
1980s (Blau &amp; Seller, 1992). Experience differences explain 6% to 30% of the pay gap 
between young Latinas and white women, and 13% to 17% of the gap between young 
Latinos and white men (England et al., 1997, Table 7). Experience explains between 7% 
and 20% of the pay gap between black and white women and men (Anderson &amp; Shapiro 
1996, p. 277; England et al., 1997, Table 7; Kilbourne et al., 1994a). 
</p>
<p>In sum, race and sex groups have become more similar in their education and expe-
rience (with the exception of black men's falling rates of college participation in the early 
1990s), and these changes have contributed to shrinking earnings disparities between 
groups. Importantly, the extent to which these differences affect workers' productivity 
depends in part on employers' decisions regarding the organization of work and the use 
of technology, as well as race and sex segregation in job assignments. The disappearance 
of educational and experience differences across groups cannot produce earnings equality 
unless employers assign workers to jobs without regard to their race and sex and compen-
sate workers at the same rate for their education and experience. In the following section, 
we assess the importance of the last factor for race- and sex-based earnings disparities. 
</p>
<p>2.1.2. UNEQUAL RATES OF RETURN TO EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE. Pay disparities 
</p>
<p>between groups stem partly from employers rewarding workers from different race-sex 
</p>
<p>groups unequally for the same credentials. Schooling, for example, has a smaller payoff 
</p>
<p>for women than men and for nonwhites than whites (Farley, 1984, p. 68). In 1995, white 
</p>
<p>^̂  The low pay that young workers of both sexes command necessarily restricts the size of the pay gap among 
</p>
<p>younger workers. The larger gap among older workers also reflects the positive association between the extent of 
</p>
<p>sex segregation and workers' age and men's greater returns to experience (reported below). </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>female college graduates who worked full-time year round earned $500 less, on average, 
than white male high school graduates who worked full-time year round, and white male 
college graduates outearned white women with postgraduate degrees by almost $12,000 
(computed from IWPR, 1996, Table 4). Black and Hispanic women with high school and 
college diplomas earned 70% to 75% of what same-race men with the same education 
earned, and Hispanic and black women with postgraduate degrees earned around 85% of 
what similar men earned (IWPR, 1996, Table 4). 
</p>
<p>Blacks have been falling behind whites in returns to education&mdash;especially for col-
lege graduates&mdash;offsetting their increasing parity in schooling. The earnings of young 
blacks have been lagging behind whites with the same amount of education (Carnoy, 
1994, pp. 121, 123). For example, in 1985, young black male college graduates earned 
89% of the earnings of white male college graduates, but by 1991 the ratio had fallen to 
76%. Young black female college graduates slightly outearned white female graduates in 
1976, but earned 13% less in 1991. During this period. Latinos/as also lost ground rela-
tive to Anglos with equal years of schooling, although the amount varies across Hispanic 
groups (Carnoy &amp; Rothstein, 1996; Corcoran, Heflin, &amp; Reyes, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Young Asians with at least some college were the only racial group who enjoyed 
higher returns to education than comparably educated, same-sex whites (Mare, 1995). At 
the other extreme are American Indian women, who were furthest from parity, followed 
by African-American and Hispanic women. American Indian college graduates who were 
16 to 34 years old, for example, earned 86% of the earnings similar white women, black 
women earned 92%, Hispanic women earned 99%, and Asian American women earned 
105% (see Carnoy, 1994, Table 6.2). Among men, blacks received the lowest rewards for 
their education relative to whites, followed by American Indians, and then Hispanics 
(Mare, 1995, p. 207; see also Harrison &amp; Bennett, 1995, pp. 174-176). In 1995, men of 
color earned two thirds to three quarters of what white men with the same degrees earned, 
while women of color earned between 90% and 100% of what white women earned (com-
puted from IWPR, 1996, Table 4). White male high school graduates without any addi-
tional schooling were particularly overrewarded for their schooling compared to minority 
men (Harrison &amp; Bennett, 1995, pp. 174-175). The same patterns hold after controlling 
for experience and region: in 1973 blacks at all educational levels earned 10.3% less than 
whites with the same education, experience, and region, compared to 16% less in 1989 
(Mishel &amp; Bernstein, 1994, Table 3.9). These trends mean that additional education will 
not be sufficient for minorities to catch up with whites in earnings (Harrison &amp; Bennett, 
1995, p. 175). 
</p>
<p>Group differences in payoff for hours worked and years of work experience also 
contribute to the pay disparities that we have been examining. Net of other factors that 
affect earnings, men received higher returns to both hours and weeks worked in 1990 
than did women (Harrison &amp; Bennett, 1995, Table 4.5), and a year's experience was 
worth considerably more to men than women (Farley, 1984, Table A.3). Men's greater 
returns to experience mean that the sex-linked pay disparity increases as workers age. 
Workers' payoff for experience also differs by race. Although this difference shrank dur-
ing the 1960s and 1970s&mdash;contributing to the declining earnings gap between blacks and 
whites&mdash;in 1980 whites still received about twice the payoff to experience that blacks did 
(Farley, 1984, pp. 68, 78, Table A.3), and this difference held for young to middle-aged 
workers (England et al., 1996, Table 2). 
</p>
<p>These race and sex differences in how employers reward workers' education and 
experience almost certainly result partly from discrimination. Of course, unequal rewards </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>364 Barbara F. Reskin AND Irene Padavic 
</p>
<p>for the same levels of schooling or experience may reflect unmeasured differences in the 
quality of education or experience, but sex differences in the returns to experience prob-
ably derive largely from job segregation. Whether discrimination stems from segregated 
jobs that do not provide incumbents with equally valuable experience or from employers' 
failure to reward education and experience equally for persons regardless of their race or 
sex, actions by employers perpetuate earnings disparities. 
</p>
<p>2.1.3. JOB SEGREGATION BY SEX AND RACE. The sex and race composition of jobs is 
associated with incumbents' average pay for two reasons. First, segregation dispropor-
tionately relegates women and minorities to the kinds of jobs that employers compensate 
poorly. Second, employers devalue workers' achievements in jobs filled primarily by women 
and minorities. Although each of these mechanisms reduces the pay of women and mi-
norities relative to white men, each affects the earnings of white men as well. 
</p>
<p>Employers' allocation of workers into higher- and lower-paying jobs based on their 
sex or race guarantees unequal pay across sex/race groups (England, 1992; Hirsch &amp; 
Schumacher, 1992; Sorensen, 1989).̂ ^ For example, if a retail store employs minority 
women as janitors, minority men as stock clerks, white women as cashiers, and white 
men as managers, white men will outearn the other three groups and minority women 
will earn the least. The relationship between the proportion of women in an occupation 
and its earnings particularly disadvantages women for two reasons. First, women are 
more likely than men to work in heavily female occupations, and second, the penalty for 
holding a mostly female job is stronger for women&mdash;especially women of color&mdash;than for 
men (England et al., 1996, Table 3; Kilbourne et al., 1994a). If young women had been 
distributed across more and less female occupations in the same way as young men in the 
1980s, the disparity in the sexes' starting pay on a job would have been at least one fifth 
smaller among both blacks and whites (England et al., 1996, p. 519). 
</p>
<p>Comparing the median weekly earnings of female and male workers employed full 
time all year in the same occupations illustrates the more negative effect of a female-
dominated job on women than men. For example, in the mid-1990s, the median weekly 
pay of female sewing-machine operators was about 86% of men's earnings of $280, and 
female cashiers averaged 87% of men's $265 (computed from U.S. Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics 1995, 1996b, 1997, Table 39). The larger penalty of working in a female occupa-
tion for women than men can have two sources: (1) employers pay men more than women 
who do identical tasks, and (2) employers segregate men and women in the same occupa-
tion into different jobs. The first alternative is illegal under the 1963 Equal Pay Act. In 
the second instance, although taking into account sex and race in assigning jobs is illegal 
under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, it is legal under the Equal Pay Act, and high 
levels of segregation are common.The more workers earn, the larger the sex pay gap 
tends to be. According to a 1993 survey of corporate executives, women at the vice presi-
dential level and higher earned 70% of what their male counterparts earned (Brooks, 
1993). Women who sold securities and financial services, for example, earned 55% of 
men's $951, and female financial managers averaged two thirds of men's earnings of 
$937 (computed from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1995, 1996b, 1997, Table 39). 
</p>
<p>Women's concentration in low-paying service jobs has insulated them from the big 
pay cuts that some men experienced as the United States lost well-paying manufacturing 
</p>
<p>^' Although neoclassical economists and sociologists disagree regarding the causes of occupational sex segregation, 
</p>
<p>they agree that it is an important mechanism in the pay gap between the sexes. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Inequality in United States Workplaces 365 
</p>
<p>jobs. Almost three fourths of the decline in the wage gap between the sexes between 1979 
and 1993 resulted from the decline in men's wages stemming from the loss of tradition-
ally male blue-collar jobs and from falling pay in surviving male blue-collar jobs (Mishel 
&amp; Bernstein, 1994, pp. 124-125). In response, many men entered service work that was 
overwhelmingly female. Therefore, although women's likelihood of employment in a job 
with poverty-level wages is 10 percentage points higher than men's, their likelihood of 
holding such a job has been declining since 1973, while men's likelihood has been grow-
ing since 1979 (Mishel &amp; Bernstein, 1994, p. 127). 
</p>
<p>Racial segregation increases racial differences in earnings: the more black workers 
in a job, the lower the pay for black and white women and men. Given the size of esti-
mated effects, working in all-black jobs would lower the pay of white women by 15%, 
that of black women by 24%, that of black men by 39%, and that of white men by 52% 
(Hirsch &amp; Schumacher, 1992). Moreover, the narrowing of the earnings gap between 
black and white women between 1940 and 1980 was due largely to declining race segre-
gation by occupation and industry (Cunningham &amp; Zalokar, 1992, p. 548). Minority 
workers' concentration in unskilled labor and service occupations and in low-paying 
specialties within more skilled occupations lowers their pay. For example, more than half 
of black, American Indian, and Hispanic male college-educated professionals worked as 
elementary or secondary teachers, social or religious workers, writers, artists, or enter-
tainers&mdash;all low-paying professions (Harrison &amp; Bennett, 1995, p. 181). Blacks'&mdash;and 
presumably Hispanics'&mdash;concentration in low-paying, nonunionized industries and in 
occupations and cities with low wage growth has exacerbated the black-white wage dis-
parity (Mishel &amp; Bernstein, 1994, pp. 188-189). The loss of manufacturing jobs that 
reduced men's average earnings in the late 1980s and early 1990s also adversely affected 
women of color, who were disproportionately concentrated in these industries (Bound &amp; 
Dresser, 1997; Mishel &amp; Bernstein, 1994, pp. 124-125). 
</p>
<p>2.1.4. THE DEVALUATION OF FEMALE- AND MINORITY-DOMINATED JOBS. Given the 
societal devaluation of women and minorities, employers may devalue and hence under-
pay jobs that are performed primarily by women or minorities. Sociologists have argued 
that predominantly female jobs are underpaid relative to the skills and responsibilities 
they involve because the devaluation of women leads to the undervaluation of stereotypically 
female work (Acker, 1989, 1990; England, 1992; Reskin, 1988). Although the same logic 
holds for people of color, their small numbers may prevent occupations from being la-
beled minority and hence devalued. In sum, although all workers in a devalued job earn 
less than their job warrants as reflected in its qualifications and duties, the predominance 
of women or minority men in devalued jobs means that the effect of any devaluation will 
fall disproportionately on women and minorities and hence contribute to earnings dis-
parities. This tendency to underpay jobs solely because of their sex or race composition 
has been termed "comparable-worth discrimination." 
</p>
<p>Comparable-worth discrimination is apparent when an occupation's sex composi-
tion affects incumbents' pay, net of measures of workers' education, experience, and job 
complexity (England, 1992; England et al., 1996; Kilbourne et al., 1994a; Kilbourne, 
England, Farkas, Heron, &amp; Weir, 1994b; Treiman &amp; Hartmann, 1981). For example, 
among middle-aged workers, performing nurturing tasks customarily sex-typed as fe-
male&mdash;such as nursing or childcare&mdash;is associated with pay losses for all workers, but 
especially women (Kilbourne et al., 1994b). In other segments of the population, occupa-
tions' sex composition explains up to 30% of the pay gap between the sexes (England, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>366 Barbara F. Reskin AND Irene Padavic 
</p>
<p>1992, p. 181; Sorensen, 1989). Among workers in their late 20s and early 30s in 1993, 
sex composition explained between 10% and 42 percent of the sex difference in hourly 
wages among whites, 45% to 73% among blacks, and 3% to 21% among Latinas/os 
(England et al., 1997, Table 6).^" Whether the race composition of occupations or jobs 
contributes to the racial gap in earnings because predominantly minority jobs are deval-
ued has not been established, because the few studies of the earnings effect of race compo-
sition have not controlled for occupational skills. Controlled studies have found no effect 
of minority composition on earnings, net of job characteristics (England, 1992), presum-
ably because minorities make up too small a proportion of the labor force to comprise a 
majority in any occupation. (Even in occupations in which minorities are concentrated, 
such as nursing aide, janitor, or cook, the majority of workers are white.) According to 
appellate and Supreme Court decisions, the 1963 Equal Pay Act does not prohibit em-
ployers from paying workers in predominantly female jobs less than workers in equally 
demanding but different jobs dominated by men. For instance, the U.S. Court of Appeals 
allowed the city of Denver to pay nurses, 97% of whom were female, less than tree trim-
mers and sign painters, male-dominated jobs (Lemons v. City and County of Denver, 
1978). These rulings have led to pressure for laws that require employers to provide equal 
pay to workers in different jobs that involve similar amounts of skill, effort, and respon-
sibility. Such laws could reduce the pay gap between the sexes by one third (IWPR, 1993, 
p. 1). Indeed, a Minnesota pay-equity law for state workers reduced a 28-point pay gap to 
18% in 4 years (IWPR, 1993). However, bureaucratic inertia and political resistance have 
set limits on the effectiveness of pay equity as a widespread solution to the pay gap (Bridges 
&amp; Nelson, 1989; Steinberg, 1987). 
</p>
<p>2.1.5. COMPENSATING DIFFERENTIALS. Some neoclassical economists suggest that the 
pay gap between the sexes may stem partly from different job values held by male and 
female workers. They argue that men seek jobs that will maximize their earnings, even 
when they involve physically difficult, dirty, or dangerous work; women, in contrast, 
trade off pay for job characteristics that facilitate combining work and family or for desir-
able working conditions. There is almost no support for this explanation of the pay gap, 
however (but see Filer, 1989). Researchers have found that female occupations pay less, 
net of working conditions (England et al., 1996; Glass &amp; Camarigg, 1992), and that 
undesirable working conditions are associated with lower, not higher wages (Jacobs &amp; 
Steinberg, 1990). 
</p>
<p>3. CONCLUSIONS 
</p>
<p>Workplace inequality by sex, race, and ethnicity is linked to inequality in all social insti-
</p>
<p>tutions because people's jobs distribute so many social and economic rewards. Jobs are 
</p>
<p>mechanisms that govern workers' access to earnings, authority, status, and mobility op-
</p>
<p>portunities as well as their exposure to pleasant or unpleasant working conditions. Job 
</p>
<p>segregation is a key mechanism in workplace inequality. Although few data exist on the 
</p>
<p>extent of job segregation, occupations&mdash;which aggregate similar jobs&mdash;are substantially 
</p>
<p>segregated by workers' sex and somewhat less so by their race and ethnicity. A variety of 
</p>
<p>" The racial disparities in earnings in this sample did not stem from comparable-worth discrimination (England et 
</p>
<p>al., 1997, Table 5). </p>

</p>
<p>factors affect the extent of segregation. Workers' education and experience play a limited 
role in sex segregation and a slightly larger one in race/ethnic segregation. Although 
workers' preferences matter, most workers "choose" between options that are constrained 
by employers' preferences and employment practices. Indeed, employers' personnel prac-
tices shape workers' preferences (Schultz, 1991, p. 141), as do antidiscrimination and 
affirmative action regulations that open sex- and race-atypical jobs to minorities and 
women. 
</p>
<p>The importance of segregation is seen in its effect on earnings disparities between 
sex, race, and ethnic groups. The concentration of men and women of different races in 
different occupations, industries, and jobs is the foremost cause of the earnings gap be-
tween the sexes and races. Race segregation contributes to the earnings gap between 
whites and minorities by disproportionately relegating people of color to lower-paying 
jobs that prevent incumbents from acquiring and using skills that employers compensate. 
Sex segregation contributes to the pay gap between the sexes both by concentrating women 
in jobs that do not reward or enhance their productive capacity and because of the devalu-
ation of predominantly female jobs. Anything that fosters job integration helps to reduce 
the pay gap between the sexes and races. Thus, the enforcement of antidiscrimination and 
affirmative action regulations has induced employers to integrate jobs, thereby making a 
dent in the pay gaps between sex/race groups. Eliminating all of the barriers to women's 
and minorities' employment in the full range of jobs would go far toward reducing the 
pay gap. However, job segregation by sex is still the rule, and race segregation&mdash;while 
less extensive&mdash;is prevalent. Job segregation means that equalizing human capital will 
not remedy the earnings disparities across race/sex groups. Pay-equity laws that cover 
public employees in some states have had a modest effect in reducing the sex gap in 
earnings. 
</p>
<p>Sex and race differences in productivity play a minor role in the pay disparities 
across race/sex groups. Although white men outperform other groups on one or another 
measure of productivity, the differences are small and have minor effects on earnings 
differences. However, women and minority men receive lower payoffs than white men for 
some of the factors that researchers treat as proxies for productivity, and these differences 
contribute to earnings disparities. 
</p>
<p>Discrimination is an important source of the earnings disparities between race-sex 
groups (Anderson &amp; Shapiro, 1996, p. 286; Cunningham &amp; Zalokar, 1992, p. 554; Farley, 
1984, p. 68; Gill, 1994; Mishel &amp; Bernstein, 1994, p. 189). First, some group differences 
in indicators of productivity, such as job experience, result from earlier discrimination by 
employers, and their contribution to earnings disparities between groups must be chalked 
up to discrimination. Discrimination also occurs when women and minorities are com-
pensated at a lower rate than white men for the same inputs.^' Sex and race segregated job 
assignments also contribute to pay discrimination by denying female and minority work-
ers access to well-paying jobs or jobs in which they can acquire skills that will enhance 
their future earnings. These discriminatory effects are seen in the association between 
occupations' sex and race composition and incumbents' pay. When the sex composition 
of a job is associated with incumbents' pay, net of job demands, discrimination results 
from the devaluation of female-dominated tasks. Legal prohibitions against most of these 
forms of discrimination have contributed to the declining rate of wage inequality, but the 
</p>
<p>^' To the extent that different returns to productivity reflect unmeasured differences in productivity, treating these 
</p>
<p>differences as indicative of discrimination will overestimate the amount of discrimination. </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>effectiveness of laws depends on good faith efforts by enforcing agencies and the ability 
of victims to detect their discriminatory treatment (which is impaired by social psycho-
logical processes; Clayton &amp; Crosby, 1992, pp. 72-79) and to challenge it. 
</p>
<p>In the 35 years since the 1963 Equal Pay Act outlawed unequal pay for equal work, 
women have been catching up with men in earnings at a rate of one third of a percent a 
year, and the pay gap between the sexes has declined by about 13 cents on the dollar. If 
this rate of progress continues (and it appears to have slowed in the early 1990s), the 
sexes would not achieve earnings parity until almost the end of the twenty-first century. 
Achieving earnings equality more quickly will require women to accumulate work expe-
rience more in line with that of men, employers to integrate customarily male jobs, and 
the spread of pay-equity principles that compensate workers for the worth of their job and 
not the sex of their co-workers. Racial disparities in earnings also declined in the 1970s 
and early 1980s. Although minorities are closer to earnings parity with same-sex whites 
than women are to same-race men, the trend toward declining inequality changed direc-
tion in the late 1980s, making it impossible to predict when racial equality in earnings 
might cease to exist. 
</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that progress depends in part on the evidence that researchers 
bring to bear on the extent of inequality in work opportunities and rewards by sex, race, 
and ethnicity. As we noted at the outset, little research examines the joint effects of race, 
sex, and ethnicity. Race is typically treated as black/white or minority/white. Available 
data indicate that the economic situation of groups that are neither white nor black differs 
from the situations of both blacks and whites. Variation exists, too, among different Asian 
and different Latin national groups. We encourage researchers to compare the situations 
of as many groups as their data allow. Such comparisons are essential for identifying the 
greatest needs for policy intervention and for recommending policies that can reduce 
workplace inequality.

<p>CHAPTER 17 
</p>
<p>Gender and Unpaid Work 
</p>
<p>BETH ANNE SHELTON 
</p>
<p>Most commonly, research on gender and unpaid work focuses on housework, although 
there are at least two other types of unpaid labor that warrant attention. In this chapter I 
consider not only housework time, but also childcare time and time spent doing volunteer 
work. I consider housework and childcare separately because some aspects of child care 
are not included in most estimates of housework, but nonetheless constitute significant 
investments of time. For example, while a measure of housework normally would include 
estimates of time spent preparing meals for children (under a general estimate of time 
spent preparing meals), it would not necessarily include time spent working with chil-
dren on homework or helping children get dressed for school. These latter activities are 
time consuming and involve work, and gender is associated with how much time indi-
viduals spend doing them (Coverman &amp; Sheley, 1986). Thus, I evaluate research on 
gendered patterns of child care time separately from a consideration of housework time. 
</p>
<p>In addition, the summary of research on gender and unpaid work includes a review 
of the research on volunteer work. Since the 1970s sociologists have recognized that the 
activities of maintaining a home and children constitute work, even when unwaged, but 
we have been slower to incorporate measures of volunteer time into our analyses of gendered 
patterns of unpaid work time. Indeed, in measures of women's and men's total "work" 
time, volunteer work time is not included (Marini &amp; Shelton, 1993), although much of 
the work associated with children, for example, is volunteer work that would be unmea-
sured in either housework or child care measures (e.g., PTO activities, soccer coach). 
Thus, the gender "equity" in total work time noted by some authors is based on an ac-
counting that excludes an important category of unpaid work (Ferree, 1991). In addition

</p>
<p>to summarizing gendered patterns of unpaid work, I review explanations of these pat-
terns and assess their success in accounting for gender differences in unpaid work. 
</p>
<p>1. HOUSEWORK TIME 
</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways that housework time and the division of household labor have 
been measured. The highest quality estimates are based on time diaries typically com-
pleted for a 24-hour period (Marini &amp; Sheiton, 1993). This method results in the most 
detail, as well as in the most accurate estimates. Nevertheless, studies comparing the 
variety of ways that housework time has been measured indicate that direct questions 
about typical time expenditures result in some overestimation, but that measures of women's 
and men's shares of housework are similar no matter what the measurement method. 
This is especially true when the measures ask individuals to estimate their time spent on 
a variety of housework tasks (e.g., doing dishes, preparing meals, doing laundry, clean-
ing house) rather than on a generic category called "housework." Since time diary esti-
mates are expensive, most studies rely on some sort of direct question. 
</p>
<p>No matter how housework time is measured, it is clear that gender is related to the 
distribution of housework. Women continue to spend significantly more time on house-
work than do men and this pattern is true whether or not women are employed (Berardo, 
Shehan, Leslie, 1987; Marini &amp; Sheiton, 1993; Presser, 1994). In the United States, most 
estimates are that women do between 65% and 80% of household labor (Greenstein, 
1996). Studies done in other countries also consistently show that women do the majority 
of household labor, although the magnitude of the gender gap varies (Gershuny &amp; 
Robinson, 1988). 
</p>
<p>Most of the studies of housework are based on samples of married women and men, 
a restriction that obscures the impact of marital status on the gender gap in housework 
time. In comparisons of married, single, and unmarried cohabiting women and men, 
researchers report that the gap between women's and men's housework time is greater 
among married couples than among either single women and men or cohabiting couples 
(McAllister, 1990; Stafford, Backman, &amp; Dibona, 1977). Most the differences in the 
gender gap in housework time by marital status are due to variation in women's house-
work Time (Sheiton &amp; John. 1993a; South &amp; Spitze, 1994). Married women spend more 
time on housework than either cohabiting or single women. 
</p>
<p>Interestingly, remarried men appear to spend more time on housework than men in 
first marriages, although the reverse is true for women (Demo &amp; Acock. 1993; Ishii-
Kuntz &amp; Coltrane, 1992), This pattern suggests that there may be some reevaluation of 
family roles for both women and men after divorce and that the result is a slightly more 
equal division of housework in second than in first marriages. 
</p>
<p>Recent time diary estimates of women's and men's housework time indicate that 
women spend 19.5 hours per week on housework compared to 9.8 hours per week for men 
(see Table 17-1). Estimates based on direct questions about housework time are higher 
than time diary estimates for both women and men but the pattern is similar. Data from 
the National Survey of Families and Households indicate that women spend approxi-
mately 37 hours per week on housework while men spend 18 hours per week (Greenstein, 
1996; see also Kamo, 1991; Marini &amp; Sheiton, 1993). 
</p>
<p>Measures of task segregation indicate that household tasks are highly segregated as 
well (Blair &amp; Lichter, 1991). Thus, in addition to men spending less time on housework </p>

<p>than women, they spend their time on different household tasks than women (Berk, 1985). 
Berk and Berk (1979) find, in addition, that men are less likely than women to do more 
than one task at a time and that men's tasks are more likely to be discretionary than are 
women's (see also Meissner, Humphries, Meis, &amp; Scheu, 1975). That is, men are more 
likely to spend time on tasks that can be scheduled for convenience than are women (e.g., 
yard care versus meal preparation). One reflection of the gender differences in household 
tasks may be the greater proportion of men who view their housework tasks as leisure or 
semileisure (Horna &amp; Lupri, 1987). A final difference in housework time is related to the 
simultaneity of tasks. With respect to doing more than one task at a time, women are 
more likely than men to prepare a meal, make lunches for school and do laundry more or 
less at the same time (Berk &amp; Berk, 1979). Moreover, a greater proportion of men's 
housework tasks are done with someone else, whereas women are more likely to do tasks 
alone (Horna &amp; Lupri, 1987; Sullivan, 1996). 
</p>
<p>1.1. Housework in Other Countries 
</p>
<p>Possibly because of Sweden's reputation for governmental encouragement of gender eq-
uity at home, there are a relatively large number of studies of the gender division of 
unpaid labor in Sweden. Swedish women spend significantly less time cooking and gro-
cery shopping than U.S. women and Swedish men spend more time cooking and cleaning 
house than their American counterparts, although there are no significant gaps in Swed-
ish and American women's and men's time spent washing dishes or doing laundry 
(Calasanti &amp; Bailey, 1991). Moreover, there is still a gap between Swedish women's and 
men's total housework time (Juster &amp; Stafford, 1991; Wright, Shire, Hwang, Dolan, &amp; 
Baxter, 1992). Gustafsson and Kjulin (1994) report that Swedish men do approximately 
35% of the housework and childcare and their time estimates are similar to figures for the 
United States (see also Juster &amp; Stafford, 1991). 
</p>
<p>While Swedish couples have been studied to determine the impact of state efforts to 
encourage gender equity at home, Japanese couples often are of interest because of their 
supposed traditionalism (Moringa, Sakata, &amp; Koshi, 1992). In fact, studies of Japanese 
couples help illustrate the relatively minor differences among industrialized countries. 
Researchers' reports of Japanese men's and women's housework time vary widely. Kamo 
(1994) finds that Japanese men do about 25% of the housework, whereas Juster and 
Stafford (1991) report that Japanese men spend only 10% as much time as women on 
housework. Moreover, Juster and Stafford's (1991) estimates of Japanese men's time are 
significantly lower than estimates for men in other industrialized countries. They report 
that Japanese men spend only 3.5 hours per week on housework compared to almost 14 
hours for men in the United States and more than 18 hours per week for men in Sweden. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>378 Beth Anne Shelton 
</p>
<p>Interestingly, they report less variation in women's housework time across industrialized 
countries than in men's. 
</p>
<p>Sanchez (1994a) has studied men's participation in household labor in Java, Sudanese 
Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, South Korea, and the United States. Although she 
does not have time estimates, she does find differences in the percentage of men who 
regularly participate in household labor (as reported by their wives). The range is from 
60% for Korea to 17% for Sudanese Indonesia. It is not, however, clear that all wives are 
referring to the same type of "help." Juster and Stafford (1991), using time estimates, 
report that women in rural Botswana and Nepal spend significantly more time and men 
less time on housework than in industrialized countries. 
</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of variation in women's and men's housework time across soci-
eties, but in no instance do men and women spend an equal or near equal amount of time 
on housework. Moreover, variations in the amount of time spent on housework do not 
vary systematically with the availability of labor saving household technology, suggest-
ing that it does not always operate to reduce household demands (Robinson, 1980). 
</p>
<p>1.2. Historical Trends in Housework Time 
</p>
<p>There are a number of studies documenting the impact of technological innovations on 
both the character of housework and how it is divided. Some emphasize the labor saving 
aspects of new technologies (Bose, 1979; Bose, Bereano, &amp; Malloy, 1984; Day, 1992; 
Jackson, 1992), while others focus on the way innovations affect women's and men's 
housework differently (Cowan, 1983). Cowan (1983), in particular, details how new house-
hold technologies not only made some tasks easier, but created new tasks. An example 
she provides is the invention of the stove, which raised expectations regarding an appro-
priate meal and involved additional work to clean and maintain the stove. She recognizes 
that the stove improved the standard of living for most households, but also that it in-
creased the workload for women. In addition, she details how the stove decreased the 
need for large quantities of wood, and thereby reduced some of men's housework. 
</p>
<p>As technological innovations made housework easier, they also justified reducing 
middle-class women's reliance on servants. This trend not only left work for middle-class 
women to do, it also led to a greater homogenization of the standard of living. As poor 
women were not hired as domestic servants they were able to work to maintain their 
households at a middle-class standard, thereby reducing class differences in the quality of 
home life (Jackson, 1992; Strasser, 1982). Bose (1979) argues that as women were drawn 
into paid labor they were increasingly able to maintain their housework standards be-
cause of technological innovations that made housework less time consuming and less 
physically demanding (see also Bose et al., 1984; Day, 1992). 
</p>
<p>Oakley (1974) focuses on the extent to which industrialization and men's movement 
into the paid labor force made "housework" increasingly invisible (see also Cowan, 1983). 
Men's absence from the home during the day and their participation in paid work encour-
aged housework activities to be viewed as something other than work. In addition, the 
work of maintaining a household was visible only to those who were home during the 
day&mdash;women and young children. 
</p>
<p>That housework was invisible to many members of the family does not mean that it 
was not time consuming. New technologies that encouraged higher standards of living 
(e.g., better and/or more complicated meals because of the stove, cleaner bathrooms be-</p>
<p/>

<p>Gender and Unpaid Work 379 
</p>
<p>cause of indoor plumbing) meant that although housework became somewhat easier dur-
ing the nineteenth and the first half of twentieth centuries, women did not spend signifi-
cantly less time on it (Cowan, 1983; Robinson, 1985). Oakley (1974) reports that women 
in the United States were spending more time on housework in 1945 than in 1929. Later 
studies indicating that women's household labor has decreased over time also show that 
their total work time (including paid work time) has not declined (Robinson, 1985). 
</p>
<p>More recent investigations of the impact of technology on household labor time 
suggest that even modern conveniences, such as the microwave oven, do not significantly 
reduce women's housework time. Robinson and Milkie (1997) report that women who 
own microwave ovens spend only 4 minutes less per day cooking than women without 
microwave ovens and those with automatic dishwashers spend only 1 minute less per day 
cleaning up after meals than those without dishwashers. Thus, "labor-saving" devices 
save less than is commonly assumed. This may reflect the higher standards associated 
with owning labor-saving appliances (e.g., washing clothes more often if you own a washing 
machine), or simply inefficiencies of the appliances (e.g., rinsing dishes before loading 
them in the dishwasher). 
</p>
<p>A number of studies evaluate relatively recent shifts in men's housework time or in 
their proportional share of housework time. Researchers vary in the extent to which they 
report significant change in the division of housework. Some argue that the division of 
household labor has become more equal over time (Robinson, 1988), while others report 
little shift in the division of household labor (Goldscheider &amp; Waite, 1991). Much of the 
disagreement reflects differences in how shifts in housework time are interpreted. Those 
studies that document men's increased responsibility for housework often measure men's 
relative share, obscuring the fact that men's share most often increases because of a de-
crease in women's housework time, rather than an increase in men's (Coltrane &amp; Ishii-
Kuntz, 1992b; Goldscheider &amp; Waite, 1991; Hiller &amp; Philliber, 1986; Spitze, 1986). 
Coverman and Sheley (1986) report that men's housework time was stable from 1965 to 
1975, although they estimate that their relative share went from 28% to 34% during the 
same period because women reduced their housework time by almost an hour per day. 
</p>
<p>One explanation for how households are maintained, given women's decreased house-
work time and men's modest increases, suggests that couples are relying more on pur-
chased services, such as lawn care, dry cleaning, and grocery delivery (Brines, 1993). 
However, operationalizing such rates of "commodity substitution" has proven difficult 
(for an attempt see Brines, 1993). 
</p>
<p>Gershuny and Robinson (1988) report that from the 1960s to the 1980s, women's 
housework time decreased, even after paid work time and number of children were taken 
into account (see also Coverman &amp; Sheley, 1986; Robinson, 1988). Women in the 1960s 
spent about 8 more hours per week cooking meals, cleaning up after meals, cleaning house, 
and doing laundry than women in the 1980s, whereas men spent about 2 hours more on these 
tasks in the 1980s than in the 1960s (Robinson, 1988). In spite of the convergence, a 
large gap between women's and men's housework time remains (see Table 17.1). 
</p>
<p>Trends in men's and women's housework time in a variety of other countries gener-
ally are similar to U.S. trends (Gershuny &amp; Robinson, 1988). From the 1970s to the 
1980s, when men's proportional share of housework in the United States increased mod-
estly, men's share of housework in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Norway also in-
creased, although there was no shift in Holland (Gershuny &amp; Robinson, 1988) (see Table 
17.2). Nonetheless, in every nation women do at least 80% of the housework. </p>

</p>
<p>1.3. Race and Housework Time 
</p>
<p>The gendered pattern of housework time varies somewhat by race as well, although the 
studies are not completely consistent. Researchers either report that black couples divide 
housework similarly to white couples (Broman, 1988, 1991; Cronkite, 1977; Hossain &amp; 
Roopnarine, 1993; Wilson, Tolson, Hinton &amp; Kiernan, 1990) or that the division of house-
work among black couples is more equal than among white couples (Beckett &amp; Smith, 
1981; Ross, 1987; Shelton &amp; John, 1993b). In spite of the inconsistency in research 
findings, it is clear that although black women and men are more likely than their white 
counterparts to think that housework is women's responsibility (Cronkite, 1977), they do 
not divide it less equally. One of the more interesting patterns with respect to race is the 
relationship between men's paid work time and their housework time. Among black men, 
the more time they spend on paid work the more time they spend on housework, while the 
reverse is true for white men (Shelton &amp; John, 1993b). This patterns suggests that the 
way black men interpret family responsibilities may be different than the way white men 
interpret them. 
</p>
<p>The gender gap in housework time differs between Mexican-Americans and Anglos, 
although most research suggests that the image of the patriarchal Mexican-American 
family is exaggerated. Golding (1990) reports that although Mexican-American men do 
less housework than Anglo men, the difference is due to differences in educational level. 
Similarly, Shelton and John (1993b) find that there is no difference in the housework 
time of Mexican-American and Anglo men once sociodemographic characteristics are 
taken into account. 
</p>
<p>2. CHILD CARE 
</p>
<p>Most research suggests that men have increased their time spent on childcare more than 
is the case for housework (Darling-Fisher &amp; Tiedje, 1990; Pleck, 1985; Presser, 1988). 
This, however, usually means interaction with children rather than care of infants and 
toddlers (Goldscheider &amp; Waite, 1991; Pleck, 1985). Similarly, men are more hkely to be </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Unpaid Work 381 
</p>
<p>childcare "helpers," leaving women responsible for the care of children (Ehrensaft, 1987; 
Brannen &amp; Moss, 1987). Researchers consistently report that women, in general, con-
tinue to spend more time on childcare than men (Barnett &amp; Baruch, 1987; Deutsch, 
Lussier, &amp; Servis, 1993; Wilson, Tolson, Hinton, &amp; Kiernan, 1990). Leslie, Anderson, 
and Branson (1991) report than among employed women and men, men spend an average 
of 36 minutes per day caring for their children compared to 1 hour and 12 minutes for 
women. Coverman and Sheley's (1986) examination of the changes in men's childcare 
time from 1965 to 1975 found that despite wives' increasing labor force participation, 
men's childcare contributions did not change significantly. 
</p>
<p>In other research, Barnett and Baruch (1987) show that the gap between the amount 
of time parents and children are home together and awake and the amount time spent in 
solo interaction with children is greater for men than for women. Men are at home and 
awake when their children are there an average of 29.4 hours per week compared to 44.45 
hours for women; men spend only 5.48 hours per week in solo interaction with their 
children compared to 19.56 hours per week far women, regardless of the wife's employ-
ment status. This significantly larger gap between time available and time spent in solo 
interaction is consistent with other researchers' reports that women are more likely to be 
responsible for the care of children than men (Gerson, 1993). 
</p>
<p>Research on Sweden reveals that child care patterns are similar to those in the United 
States, although men do proportionally more in Sweden than in the United States. 
Gustafsson and Kjulin (1994) report that men spend approximately 5.0 hours per week 
on "active child care" compared to 9.7 hours for women (see also Lamb, Hwang, Broberg, 
Bookstein, Hult, &amp; Frodi, 1988). These estimates are similar to those for the United 
States (see Leslie, Anderson &amp; Branson, 1991). As is the case for the United States, Lamb 
et al. (1988) find that men spend more time playing with children than caring for them. 
In other words, more of men's childcare time is discretionary than is the case for women, 
and men spend more time on relatively pleasurable aspects of childcare than do women 
(e.g., playing with children versus changing diapers). Unlike other researchers, Hannah 
and Quarter (1992) report that Canadian men and women spend similar amounts of time 
on childcare but that women spend significantly more time on housework than do men, 
although they do not report on the nature of men's and women's childcare activities. This 
is in contrast to Homa and Lupri's (1987) findings that although Canadian fathers have a 
relatively high degree of participation in childcare, mothers still are responsible for the 
greatest proportion of childcare tasks. 
</p>
<p>3. UNDERSTANDING THE DISTRIBUTION 
OF HOUSEWORK AND CHILDCARE 
</p>
<p>The variety of perspectives that have been developed to account for the division of house-
</p>
<p>hold labor can, in most cases, be applied to understanding childcare time as well. In the 
</p>
<p>majority of cases, however, childcare is considered only to the extent that care of children 
</p>
<p>is measured in housework items (e.g., meal preparation, indoor cleaning), rather than in 
</p>
<p>a separate measure of childcare. 
</p>
<p>There is a large body of literature that focuses on accounting for the division of 
</p>
<p>household labor. At least three dominant explanations for the division of household labor 
</p>
<p>have emerged from this research tradition, although none of them alone or in combina-
</p>
<p>tion can fully account for the pattern of the division of housework. The most common </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>382 Beth Anne Shelton 
</p>
<p>explanations for the division of household labor identify time constraints, ideology, and 
relative resources as possibly accounting for it (Ross, 1987; Shelton, 1992). 
</p>
<p>The time constraints approach, also known as the demand/response capability 
(Coverman, 1985) or situational view (England &amp; Farkas, 1986), conceptualizes the divi-
sion of household labor as a consequence of other demands on individuals' time. This 
explanation identifies women's greater household labor time as a consequence of their 
fewer hours spent in paid labor and number and ages of children (Greenstein, 1996; 
Silver &amp; Goldscheider, 1994). 
</p>
<p>The majority of studies evaluating the impact of women's and men's paid work time 
on their housework time find that the more time individuals spend in paid labor the less 
time they spend on housework (Acock &amp; Demo, 1994; Brines, 1993; Demo &amp; Acock, 
1993) and childcare (Coverman &amp; Sheley, 1986; McHale &amp; Huston, 1984). However, 
most studies also note that the association is stronger for women than it is for men (McHale 
&amp; Huston, 1984) and that women continue to do more housework and childcare than men 
no matter how much time they spend in paid labor (Beckett &amp; Smith, 1981; Kamo, 1991; 
Newell, 1993). Thus, although, paid work time is associated with housework time, it 
cannot account for all of the gender gap in housework time. 
</p>
<p>A number of studies investigate the relationship between women's paid work time 
and their husbands' housework time. These studies report inconsistent findings, with 
some indicating that husband's housework time is responsive to their wives' paid work 
time (Blair &amp; Lichter, 1991; Brines, 1993; Nickels &amp; Metzen, 1982), although many 
report a weak or nonexistent association (Levant, Slattery, &amp; Loiselle, 1987). Particularly 
problematic are studies that evaluate the effect of wives' paid work time on men's relative 
share of housework (Coltrane &amp; Ishii-Kuntz, 1992a; Kamo, 1988; Ross, 1987). Measur-
ing relative share of housework makes it impossible to identify the source of any variation 
in men's share. It may be due to shifts in women's and/or men's actual housework time. 
Since it is clear that women reduce their housework time in response to paid work de-
mands, at least some portion of the association between women's paid work time and 
men's relative share of housework will be due to changes in wives' housework time. 
</p>
<p>Among those who have evaluated the impact of wives' paid work time on husbands' 
housework and childcare time, some find a weak association (Blair &amp; Lichter, 1991) and 
some find no statistically significant relationship at all (Brayfield, 1992). Beckett and 
Smith (1981) report that paid labor time affects white women's child care time more than 
it affects their husbands' time and Tuttle (1994) finds that wives' work hours are nega-
tively associated with husbands' childcare participation (see also Barnett &amp; Baruch, 1987; 
John, 1996). Similarly, Leshe et al. (1991) find that women's paid work time is associ-
ated with the amount of time they are responsible for their children, but that it has no 
effect on the time husbands are responsible. 
</p>
<p>Men's housework tasks also may be affected by their wives' or their own paid work 
time. Atkinson and Huston (1984) report that men do more female-typed tasks in re-
sponse to their wives' greater paid work time while Blair and Lichter (1991) find that 
household tasks are more segregated the more time men spend in paid labor. These stud-
ies point to an important aspect of the division of household labor&mdash;the gendered nature 
of the housework tasks that women and men undertake. 
</p>
<p>Rather than simply evaluating husbands' and wives' paid work time, Kingston and 
Nock (1985) examined the impact of work schedule on the division of household labor 
(see also Blair &amp; Lichter, 1991; Brayfield, 1995; Presser, 1994; Wharton, 1994), while 
Presser (1988) evaluated the impact of shift work on child care time. These studies find </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Unpaid Work 383 
</p>
<p>that off-scheduling (husbands and wives working somewhat different hours) is associated 
with men spending more time on housework (Kingston &amp; Nock, 1985) and childcare 
(Presser, 1988). That is, when men have time at home when their wives are at work they 
do more housework than when they work the same hours as their wives. A few studies 
also have documented a similar positive effect of off-scheduling on women's housework 
time (Pleck &amp; Staines, 1985). 
</p>
<p>Although a wife's paid work time is not clearly associated with her husband's house-
work time, her employment may be associated with it. That is, it may be wife's employ-
ment per se, rather than hours spent in paid labor that affects husband's household labor 
time. In addition, employment may be even more strongly associated with housework 
time than paid work time for women. Studies comparing dual-earner and single-earner 
households indicate that women do most of the housework no matter what their employ-
ment status (Berardo et al., 1987; Bergmann, 1986; Mederer, 1993; Pleck &amp; Staines, 
1985), but that women in dual-earner households share more of the responsibility for 
household tasks than women in single-earner households (Maret &amp; Finlay, 1984). The 
sex typing of household tasks is similar in single-earner and dual-earner households 
(Coltrane, 1990; Mederer, 1993). 
</p>
<p>Just as paid work time has a greater effect on women's than on men's household 
labor, children also affect women's housework time more than men's (Gershuny &amp; 
Robinson, 1988; Shelton, 1992). Berk (1985) found that the presence of a single infant 
increased the total monthly household tasks by more than 400 hours, adding more than 
105 minutes to each household work day. Studies using representative samples report 
that the more children and the younger the children in a household the more time women, 
and to a much smaller extent, men, spend on housework (Brines. 1993; Presser, 1994). 
</p>
<p>The greater effect of both children and paid work on women's than on men's house-
work poses some problems for the time constraints explanation of the division of house-
hold labor. The perspective provides no rationale for the different effects of time con-
straints (e.g., paid work and children) on women's and men's housework time. In addition, 
it is difficult to determine the extent to which there is a simple, unidirectional effect of 
paid work time on housework, or whether there are reciprocal effects (but see Kalleberg 
&amp; Rosenfeld, 1990). Thus, both the nature of the empirical association between paid 
work time and housework time and the explanation itself have serious limitations with 
respect to helping us understand the gendered division of household labor. 
</p>
<p>A second approach to explaining the division of household labor focuses on ideology 
or gender role attitudes to account for women's greater housework time (Huber &amp; Spitze, 
1983; Spitze, 1988). According to this explanation, women's greater household labor 
time can be explained by reference to their own and their husband's attitudes about who 
should do the housework. Thus, the hypothesis is that the more egalitarian women's and 
men's sex role attitudes, the less housework women will do and the more housework men 
will do. In general, studies support this explanation, although the strength of the associa-
tion varies by gender and men's attitudes have more impact on their wives' household 
labor than wives' attitudes have on their husbands' housework time. 
</p>
<p>The majority of studies indicate that the more egalitarian men's gender role atti-
tudes, the more equal the division of household labor (Coltrane &amp; Ishii-Kuntz, 1992b; 
Kamo, 1988; Ross, 1987), although some report that this effect is due mostly to the im-
pact of men's attitudes on women's housework time, rather than to the effect of men's 
attitudes on their own housework time (Presser, 1994; Sanchez, 1994b). This pattern is 
consistent with a number of qualitative studies that illustrate the extent to which women's </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>384 Beth Anne Shelton 
</p>
<p>housework time is a function of their husbands' expectations (DeVault, 1991). Wives' 
responsiveness to their husbands is also supported by studies indicating that women's 
gender role attitudes are less strongly associated with their housework time than are their 
husbands' gender role attitudes (Presser, 1994), although Greenstein (1996) reports an 
interaction effect between wives' and husbands' gender role ideologies. 
</p>
<p>With the exception of a few studies that have poor measures of either gender role 
attitudes (Brayfield, 1992) or housework time (Ross, 1987), the findings regarding the 
impact of gender role attitudes on housework time are consistent. Nevertheless, when 
considering the entire gender gap in housework time, gender role attitudes can account 
for only a small part of it. In addition, although attitudes are associated with housework 
time, the variation is around a very unequal base, so that, in general, even those couples 
with egalitarian attitudes have an unequal division of household labor, one that is only 
somewhat less unequal than other couples'. Men with traditional gender role attitudes 
are not any less likely to participate in childcare than men with more egalitarian attitudes 
(Barnett &amp; Baruch, 1987; McHale &amp; Huston, 1984) and some find that men with more 
traditional childcare attitudes spend more time on child care (Tuttle, 1994). 
</p>
<p>One of the oldest approaches to understanding the division of household labor is 
based on Blood and Wolfe's (1960) study of relative resources and their impact on deci-
sion-making. This approach is based on the view that individuals will seek to minimize 
their time spent on housework (because it is unpleasant) and that they will use any re-
source advantage to do so. Thus, the spouse with the most resources will use them to 
negotiate his or her way out of housework (Brines, 1993) or childcare (Coverman &amp; 
Sheley, 1986; Deutsch et al., 1993; John, 1996). Resources most often are conceptualized 
and measured as education, occupational prestige, and earnings. 
</p>
<p>An alternative explanation for the expected relationship between relative resources 
and housework time is offered by neoclassical economists who argue that relative re-
sources will be associated with household labor time because of households' attempts to 
most efficiently allocate effort (Becker, 1981,1985). According to the neoclassical model, 
the person with the most resources will maximize utilities for the household by concen-
trating his or her effort in paid labor while household utilities will be similarly maxi-
mized if the individual with fewer resources devotes him- or herself to household labor. 
The important distinction between the relative resource and neoclassical models involves 
the conceptualization of the family. In the relative resource model individuals seek to 
maximize utilities whereas in the neoclassical model families seek to maximize utilities. 
Since women's earnings are generally lower than men's, both models are consistent with 
women doing more housework than men, although for different reasons. 
</p>
<p>With important exceptions, the empirical evaluations of the relative resource model 
support it. The smaller the earnings gap between husbands and wives the more equal the 
division of household labor (Blair &amp; Lichter, 1991; Presser, 1994) and child care (Deutsch 
et al., 1993). However, Leslie et al., (1991) find no significant effect of the mother's 
relative earnings on the division of childcare work. In addition, although the greater the 
woman's earnings relative to her husband's the less time she spends on housework, the 
size of the effect is small (Goldscheider &amp; Waite, 1991). Moreover, the fact that the 
majority of wives earn less than their husbands creates problems for interpreting the 
effect. The relative resource model predicts that not only should an individual's relative 
earnings be associated with the division of household labor when the wife earns less than 
the husband (as is true in the majority of households), but that this association should 
hold for those households where the wife earns more than the husband. Somewhat prob-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Unpaid Work 385 
</p>
<p>lematically for the relative resource explanation, Brines (1994) reports that men who are 
economically dependent on their wives compensate by not increasing their housework 
time, a pattern that she interprets as supporting a "gender display" interpretation for the 
division of household labor. Whether the gender display interpretation works or not, the 
unequal association between women's and men's earnings and housework time, as well 
as the pattern for couples where the wife earns more than the husband, pose problems for 
the relative resource/neoclassical explanation for the division of household labor. 
</p>
<p>Educational attainment is often used as a supplemental measure of resources, but is 
more problematic than earnings because education is associated with gender role ideol-
ogy, thus making interpretation of any association between education and housework 
difficult. In fact, men's level of education is typically positively associated with their own 
and negatively associated with their wives' housework time, suggesting that education 
may be a better measure of ideology than of resources (Haddad, 1994; Presser, 1994; 
South &amp; Spitze, 1994). Women's educational level is negatively associated with their 
housework time (Bergen, 1991; Brines, 1993; South &amp; Spitze, 1994), supporting both the 
relative resource and ideology explanations. Women with more education have more re-
sources and may be able to negotiate or buy their way out of housework, but those with 
more education also typically have more egalitarian attitudes and may spend less time on 
housework in response to attitudes rather than resources (Huber &amp; Spitze, 1983). 
</p>
<p>Studies investigating the impact of occupational prestige on household labor are 
even less consistent. Some find that men's occupational prestige is negatively associated 
with their housework time (McAllister, 1990), while others find that it is positively asso-
ciated with housework time (Berk &amp; Berk, 1978; Deutsch et al., 1993). It is not clear that 
it is the resources associated with occupational prestige that account for the association. 
Aytac (1990) finds that the husbands of wives who are decision-makers on the job spend 
more time on housework than men whose wives are not decision-makers. Men's deci-
sion-making authority on the job also may account for some of the association between 
occupational prestige and housework time. Further undermining the usefulness of the 
relative resource explanation is the finding that women's occupational prestige is not 
associated with their housework time (McAllister, 1990). 
</p>
<p>As a consequence of the failure of the time constraint, ideology, and relative resource 
explanations to adequately account for the gender gap in housework time or for variables 
measuring time constraints, ideology, or resources to be associated in expected ways with 
housework time, some researchers have proposed a social construction of gender (Berk, 
1985; Potuchek, 1992; West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987) or gender display (Brines, 1993,1994) 
explanation for the gendered division of household labor (De Vault, 1991). A basic premise 
of the gender display explanation is a reconceptualization of housework; within this ap-
proach, housework may be a resource for the production of gender or a way to display 
gender, rather than simply something that women and men seek to minimize (Berk, 
1985; West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1993). As such, this approach potentially may account for 
economically dependent men's low involvement in housework (Brines, 1994), economi-
cally successful women's involvement in housework (Silberstein, 1992), as well as for the 
anomalous findings with respect to measures of time constraints, ideology and resources. 
</p>
<p>For example, the gender differences in the way paid work time and children are 
associated with housework time may be partially accounted for by the gender display 
model. Women may respond to children differently than men because, through their re-
sponse, they attend not only to the needs of children but also produce themselves appro-
priately as women. In addition, the meaning attached to employment may be different for </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>386 Beth Anne Shelton 
</p>
<p>men and women. For men, employment may help them construct themselves as men, 
thus freeing them to participate in housework, whereas men who are not able to construct 
themselves as men through employment may resort to other forms of "gender display" 
(Brines, 1994). Silberstein (1992) argues that a similar dynamic may account for eco-
nomically successful women's participation in some forms of housework; through their 
employment they fail to construct themselves as women, so they too resort to other forms 
of gender display (in this case participation in household labor) that may appear irratio-
nal if housework is conceptualized only as a means of producing a meal or a clean house 
rather than also gender itself 
</p>
<p>4. VOLUNTEER WORK 
</p>
<p>An important but often neglected type of unpaid work is volunteer work. Those studies 
that consider it generally seek to understand women's and men's participation in volun-
teer activities and only incidentally make a connection between household work and vol-
unteer activities. The best known studies of women's volunteer work focus on its status 
production (Daniels, 1988) or class maintenance (Ostrander, 1984) effects. Mueller (1975) 
argues that women also may participate in volunteer work because it enhances their human 
capital (see also Schram &amp; Dunsing, 1981), although there is no indication that volunteer 
work enhances human capital in a way that translates into employment (Blau, 1976). 
</p>
<p>Blau (1976) asserts that women participate in volunteer work because of the con-
straints placed on them by their families, especially children. That is, they volunteer 
because time constraints make paid work impossible. An alternative interpretation is that 
participating in volunteer activities is an extension of childcare and housework responsi-
bilities. McPherson and Smith-Lovin (1982) and Booth (1972) document women's greater 
participation in "domestic" or "expressive" voluntary associations compared to men's 
greater participation in job-related volunteer associations. Domestic associations include 
youth and neighborhood associations, both of which involve activities closely related to 
what is typically defined as housework and childcare. In spite of this, research on women's 
unpaid work has focused almost exclusively on housework and childcare done in the 
home (Daniels, 1988 is an exception). 
</p>
<p>Hayghe (1991) reported that 18.8% of women performed unpaid volunteer work for 
school or other educational institutions, compared to 10.5% of men. In addition, women 
were more likely to participate in religious organizations. Of those who did volunteer 
work, women typically worked more weeks per year than men, although their hours spent 
per week on volunteer activities were similar. The majority of both women and men spent 
less than 5 hours per week on volunteer activities, around 20% spent from 5 to 9 hours, 
and the remainder spent 10 hours or more per week on volunteer activities. 
</p>
<p>If women's participation includes parent-teacher organizations, organizing children's 
recreational activities, or other activities related to children it can be counted as additional 
childcare. Their neighborhood and community activities are an extension of the status 
production aspects of their housework (Daniels 1988; Ostrander, 1984) and some of these 
activities may be communal versions of housework (neighborhood cleanup campaigns). 
</p>
<p>5. CONCLUSIONS 
</p>
<p>Gender remains strongly associated with women's and men's patterns of unpaid work. 
</p>
<p>The amount of time invested in unpaid work as opposed to paid work, the distribution of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Unpaid Work 387 
</p>
<p>unpaid work time among specific tasks, and the patterns of care and responsibility are all 
determined to a large degree by one's gender. Women continue to spend more time than 
men on housework, whether they are employed or not; they continue to do more of the 
work involved in caring for children and to take more responsibility for that work; and 
finally, women's volunteer activities are more likely to be related to family than are men's. 
</p>
<p>There have been numerous attempts to explain the gendered patterns of time spent 
on housework and childcare and, although there is support for each of them, none can 
fully account for the gendered patterns of unpaid work time. The gender display approach 
offers some hope for better understanding the relationship between gender and unpaid 
work time, but efforts to evaluate its usefulness are necessarily indirect. That is, there is 
no simple way to determine the extent to which unpaid work time is an expression of 
gender; we can only determine whether a particular pattern is consistent with the gender 
display model. 
</p>
<p>It remains clear that the nature of women's and men's participation in housework, 
childcare and volunteer work are different and that changes in women's labor force par-
ticipation are not sufficient to eliminate gender differences in unpaid work activities.

<p>Gender and Family Relations 
</p>
<p>DENISE D . BIELBY* 
</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>Among the institutional transformations witnessed by industrial societies over the past 
century, one of the most profound is the emergence of the private, nuclear family. Accord-
ing to historians, the nuclear family has been around since the seventeenth century (see 
Cherlin, 1983), but the existence of the private nuclear family, organized around the 
husband as breadwinner and wife as homemaker, was not ascendant until the 1920s. 
With industrialization, production moved out of the household, the family became the 
primary locus for emotional satisfaction, and the private nuclear form took on normative 
expectations that were institutionalized and idealized by the 1950s as the "traditional" 
family. Families "are the places of sexuality, eating, sleeping, and of the thick and close 
forms of relatedness imaged by biological ('blood') ties of kinship" (Thome, 1992, p. 
10), although the social arrangements that constitute them are both numerous and vari-
able. However, as feminists and others have observed for more than a decade, the mono-
lithic notion of the traditional, nuclear family is difficult to dispel because it seems to be 
the most natural and biological, the most timeless and unchanging of all social institu-
tions. 
</p>
<p>Although the family is a central, enduring, and taken-for-granted social institution, 
it is also one of the most variable, contested, debated, and analyzed by scholars, 
policymakers, special interest groups, and family members alike. Feminist scholars argue 
that the family is an ideological concept as much as it is an institution, and that even its

<p>boundedness as a private institution unto itself that can be wholly separated from the 
public sphere needs reconsideration (Ferree, 1990; Osmond, 1987). Embodied in cultural 
assumptions and gender relations are the practical, material, and ideological notions that 
construct the family. According to Coontz and Parson (1997, p. 446), the emerging no-
tion of the private nuclear family was "an emotional and ethical substitute for more po-
litical and social ways of conceptualizing interpersonal and intergenerational obligations. 
The new ideology also reframed socioeconomic and racial inequalities as differences in 
family organization and maternal roles, paving the way for today's debate over 'family 
values.' " It is within this context of variation, transformation, and debate that I review 
theory and research on gender and family relations, and in particular, the ways in which 
their intersection constitutes what is defined as "family." While the focus of this chapter 
is to examine gender and family relations, I also address gender in family relations as a 
pivotal issue. 
</p>
<p>Neo-institutional theory is used to organize my analysis of gender and family rela-
tions. According to the neo-institutionalist perspective, "institutions do not merely reflect 
the preferences and power of the units constituting them; the institutions themselves 
shape those preferences" (DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1991, p. 7). Institutionalization itself is 
seen as a process by which certain social relationships and actions gradually come to be 
taken for granted. In addition, institutions such as the family are built upon shared cogni-
tions that define "what has meaning and what actions are possible" (DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 
1991, p. 9). Thus, the notion of the private, nuclear family has become entrenched as 
"monolithic," and is itself a resource that can be appropriated by politicians and others 
concerned with delineating the moral boundaries of society. 
</p>
<p>Institutional theory tends to deemphasize actors' deliberate construction of social 
arrangements to achieve desired outcomes. However, individuals do act purposively, dem-
onstrating agency based upon understandings, shared or otherwise, of their social context 
as the basis for action (Sewell, 1992). Thus, individual agency, manifested as choices and 
preferences, must be considered in cultural and historical contexts. Choices and prefer-
ences themselves are not universal and unchanging, although once a set of social prac-
tices are "institutionalized" they become self sustaining. This occurs because "institu-
tions do not just constrain options: they establish the very criteria by which people discover 
their preferences" (DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1991, p. 11). Thus, people choose actions be-
cause they offer socially constructed and legitimate paths for solving certain social and 
individual needs. For example, same-sex couples might participate in a "commitment 
ceremony" to demonstrate their dedication to a relationship that is not legally sanctioned 
by the state. By doing so, they are drawing upon and transforming institutionalized scripts 
about marriage and family. Institutionalization constrains choices, but the sources of con-
straint come from unspoken understandings shared among actors (DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 
1991, p. 12). 
</p>
<p>Institutional analysis draws attention to the ideological and symbolic significance of 
gendered social arrangements within the family as they relate to the organization and 
enactment of familial relationships themselves. Members' social scripts and cognitive 
schemas are guides to action within family relationships. Consequently, attributions (such 
as assumptions about fathers as providers), habit (such as division of labor in household tasks 
or in caretaking of kin), and practical action (such as who organizes family dinners or holiday 
events) are central to ongoing participation within the family and inform this analysis. 
</p>
<p>In this chapter, I first address gender and emotion work, focusing on how emotion 
labor genders the social scripts of caring relations within the family. Then I review re-</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>search on parenting, attending to variability in the gendered enactment of mothering and 
fathering. The summary of research on kinship focuses on intergenerational caregiving 
and women's pivotal role in the allocation of care to others. I then go on to address how 
gender interacts with waged labor to affect power in domestic relationships. I conclude 
with a discussion of conceptualizations of the family and the gendered nature of the range 
of practices that can be subsumed under the concept of family. 
</p>
<p>2. GENDER AND EMOTION WORK 
</p>
<p>Theories and research on family structure that were influential in the 1950s and 1960s 
have been reevaluated by feminist scholars who have emphasized the genderedness of 
family relations (see, e.g., Beneria &amp; Stimpson, 1987; Thorne &amp; Yalom, 1992). Evelyn 
Nakano Glenn (1987) provided a comprehensive discussion of the paradigm shift that 
occurred within family sociology in the 1980s, including the inadequacies of then-pre-
vailing structural-functionalist, exchange, and interactionist theoretical approaches, and 
the then-emerging "feminist rethinking" about family life. Glenn gave special emphasis 
to three emerging issues of central importance to a gendered understanding of the family: 
motherhood and mothering, power and inequality, and households and the political 
economy. In particular, Glenn's analysis deconstructed the family, addressed the impor-
tance of separating mothering from motherhood as a social construction, explained how 
exposing hierarchical divisions within the family illuminates conflicting interests among 
family members, and invited a more adequate understanding of the family's complex 
relationship to the economy and the state, including how that relationship varies by race 
and class. 
</p>
<p>The social constructs of masculinity and femininity are integral to every aspect of 
the social organization of biological sex, and the symbolic display of gender in domestic 
settings is one of the most deep-seated of cultural expectations (Goffman, 1977). In a 
study of households comprised of married couples. Brines (1993) found that economi-
cally dependent husbands contribute less to household labor than do husbands with better 
labor market prospects. She reasoned that economic insecurity causes men to become 
more concerned with their roles as "providers," which would be threatened by taking on 
a greater share of household responsibilities. Thus, gender does more than organize the 
labor associated with sleeping, child-raising, eating, and other basic human activities. 
The enactment of gender, both symbolically and practically, also defines the extent to 
which individuals are considered to be fulfilling their sex- and gender-linked rights, 
responsibilities, duties, and obligations within the family (see also Kane, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Emotion work occurs in both work and household settings. In each, women are 
expected to assume the tasks of attending carefully to how a setting affects others in it, 
creating comfortable ambiance through expressions of gaiety, warmth, and sympathy; 
conveying cheerful, affectionate concern for and interest in others; and attending to the 
behavior of group members so that no one is left out or ill at ease (Hochschild, 1983; 
Luxton, 1980). Women are the primary providers of emotional support in families, just as 
they are of the physical activities of running a household, but that emotional labor is 
largely unrecognized. As Erickson notes, "The invisibility of emotion work persists de-
spite clear indications that providing emotional support is as much embedded within 
women's daily family routine as is the performance of housework and childcare duties" 
(1993, p. 890). Emotion work is invisible in two ways. First, it is unacknowledged and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>394 Denise D. Bielby 
</p>
<p>undervalued, as are many of the skills and contributions women bring to paid work. 
Second, it is literally invisible; others are not even aware of the effort, time, and energy 
that goes into such activities, and women themselves often see this work as "natural" and 
simply part of getting things done (see also Daniels, 1987). Thus, the family division of 
labor in emotion work and its management is another manifestation of the symbolic sig-
nificance of the most basic activities that take place in the household. In sum, gender 
defines the normative expectations for and of those who comprise the domestic unit and 
the activities within it, and emotion labor, including its type, degree, and management, 
are central to the gendered social construction and enactment of the family. 
</p>
<p>2.1. Emotion Work and the Gendered Division of Labor 
</p>
<p>Wharton and Erickson's (1993) analysis of emotion management at home and on the job 
identified three categories of emotions that are particularly relevant to family: those that 
integrate, such as love, loyalty, and pride, which bind groups together; ones that differen-
tiate, such as fear, anger, and contempt, causing groups to splinter; and those that mask 
affect, which encompass displays of neutrality and restraint. Although each of these cat-
egories has received attention by scholars, feminist research has tended to focus upon the 
integrative ones, such as nurturance and caregiving, because they entail the gendered 
labor that binds members together along culturally prescribed notions of what a "family" 
ought to be. Wharton and Erickson (1993) observed that the effort associated with this 
labor involves not only creating the substance or content of emotions, but also their man-
agement, including their allocation and coordination. "Family roles are thus character-
ized by an 'emotional division of labor,' whereby women and men are expected to per-
form different kinds and amounts of emotion management" (1993, p. 471). 
</p>
<p>The emotion work that is done in family contexts has a unique relationship to re-
sponsibility and obligation. Heimer (1996) observed that this connection is especially 
strong when responsibilities are "fates," such as responsibilities for children or relatives, 
where there is little to no opportunity to undo the relationship, rather than "opportuni-
ties," such as workplace assignments or educational decisions, where an individual's 
decision to "take responsibility" involves more personal choice. Conformity to normative 
expectations that obligate women to become invested in the familial realm leads to fur-
ther gender specialization. Over time, "the gender differences in distributions of caring 
work encumber women with responsibilities that are far less easily shifted to others, 
leaving men freer to invest in responsibilities that are both more likely to lead to rewards 
and easier to escape should they become burdensome" (Heimer, 1996, p. 243). 
</p>
<p>Not only is caring work less easily shifted to others, as England and Kilbourne 
(1990) noted, but it also requires one to invest in developing skills that are not easily 
transferred to other intimate relationships. Examples they provide include forming at-
tachments with in-laws, learning a partner's sexual preferences, or learning how to re-
solve disagreements with a partner. Thus, not only is emotion work typically an obliga-
tion rather than a choice, but upon dissolution of a relationship the partner who has 
specialized in such tasks has made investments that have little value in a new relation-
ship. In contrast, the payoff for skills that have value in the paid labor market is un-
changed by dissolution of a relationship. Thus, as England and Kilbourne pointed out, a 
traditional household division of labor doubly disadvantages women. First, compared to 
their partners, they have less invested in skills that are valued in the market for paid </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Family Relations 395 
</p>
<p>labor. Second, while their partner's labor market skills retain their value regardless of 
whether the intimate relationship is dissolved, the woman's investment in the unique, 
relationship-specific skills required to manage the emotional requirements of a relation-
ship are of little or no value in a new relationship. The consequences of this asymmetry 
for power in relationships are discussed in the following paragraphs. 
</p>
<p>In Western culture, dyadic love relationships between adults create the basis for 
family units. In such relationships, the provision of care and caregiving is a central com-
ponent of intimacy and commitment (Cancian, 1987). Caregiving is the activity of at-
tending and responding to another's suffering, desires, and needs, and of striving to pre-
vent harm and protect and promote another's welfare (Thompson, 1993). Gilligan's (1982) 
study of gender differences in relationships found that the nonhierarchical ordering that 
tends to characterize women's relationships with others, regardless of status or position, 
fosters a belief in the ethic of care and caregiving. This ethic defines the self and other as 
interdependent, thus forming the basis for the "ideal of responsibility" and "equality of 
rights" in intimate relationships (1982, pp. 74, 149, 166). These gendered differences 
are, in turn, associated with differences in how men and women conduct themselves 
within domestic relationships. For example, women, on average, are more likely than 
men to define the anticipation of another's needs as care (Dressel &amp; Clark, 1990). 
</p>
<p>The impact of gender and gender ideology on the domestic distribution and enact-
ment of emotion work is not limited to the study of heterosexual couples. Burgeoning 
research on gay and lesbian partners shows how same-sex couples are also affected by the 
normative ideologies of both gender and the family. Blumstein and Schwartz's pioneer-
ing 1983 study of the domestic practices of same-sex and heterosexual couples found that 
household responsibilities, including emotion work, are more equally shared among gays 
and lesbians, regardless of employment status. However, compared to lesbians, gays tend 
to have a more traditional division of labor in the household (McWhirter &amp; Mattison, 
1984; Peplau &amp; Cochran, 1990). In a study of lesbian coparents, Sullivan (1996) found 
that in many couples, partners allocated their paid work and family responsibilities so 
that neither parent assumed an unequal share of the labor, and so that neither partner was 
economically dependent on the other. However, achieving such equity required a con-
scious and deliberate effort to countervene social scripts that otherwise prescribe role 
relationships. 
</p>
<p>2.2. Parenting, Mothering, and Fathering 
</p>
<p>With the emergence of the private, nuclear family, family relations shifted from those 
</p>
<p>marked by patriarchal authority, distance, and deference to ones fostering individual au-
</p>
<p>tonomy, more intense affective bonds, and the pursuit of personal happiness (Laslett, 
</p>
<p>1973; Stone, 1977). Chodorow's (1978) analysis of the reproduction of mothering cap-
</p>
<p>tures the consequences of this shift for parenting in the private, nuclear family. In par-
</p>
<p>ticular, her work reveals the unique way in which mothering is reproduced by hetero-
</p>

<p>family, women are predisposed to mothering practices that reproduce this pattern. As 
Chodorow describes, "Women's mothering, then, produces psychological self-definition 
and capacities appropriate to mothering in women, and curtails and inhibits these capaci-
ties and this self-definition in men" (1978, p. 208). In addition, a gender ideology that 
obligates women to maternal roles reinforces and sustains the identity processes described 
by Chodorow (Glenn, 1987). 
</p>
<p>Men are not subject to comparable cultural scripts or identity processes regarding 
parenthood (Belsky &amp; Volling, 1987; Cowan &amp; Cowan, 1987, 1988; Cowan et al., 1985). 
While the concept of "paternity" defines a father's position relative to child and mother, 
it does not prescribe the activities that constitute "fathering." Fathering as caretaking and 
caregiving is far less scripted than mothering as ideology or action (Amato, 1989; Phares, 
1993, 1996; Ruddick, 1989; Silverstein, 1996). In a relatively early study of men's self-
definitions of the fathering role, Heath (1976) found that both men and women report 
being invested in expressive involvement (e.g., demonstrating love, affection, and enjoy-
ment of one's children, and spending time with them), but fewer men than women feel 
the need to fulfill their responsibility to their children's socialization in this way. Simi-
larly, fathers and mothers have different involvements in activities that facilitate children's 
growth; fathers are less inclined to see sharing in child-rearing decisions and activities, 
possessing knowledge of children and child-rearing techniques, or developing specific 
character traits in their children as essential for competent fathering (see also Simons &amp; 
Beaman, 1996). Other research finds that the strength of this role specialization is stron-
ger among married men who are more ideologically traditional; men who believe that 
their primary role in the family is one of provider define their subjective distribution of 
commitments to work and family accordingly (Bielby &amp; Bielby, 1989, 1992). While gen-
der ideology shapes men's orientation toward parenting, even egalitarian couples who 
self-consciously share the parenting role still divide involvements with childcare along 
fairly traditional lines (Coltrane, 1996). 
</p>
<p>If belief in the provider role prescribes how married men contribute to parenting, 
divorce has little effect in expanding their notions of fathering (Furstenberg &amp; Nord, 
1985). Although it is presumed that children of divorced parents are less likely to experi-
ence emotional and behavioral problems when nonresidential fathers remain involved in 
their children's upbringing, research by psychologists who measured child adjustment 
following marital disruption found limited support for this hypothesis (Amato, 1993). 
Instead, rather than seeing expanded possibilities as caregivers, divorced fathers tended 
to define their responsibilities around notions of entertainment and play, interacting with 
their children as if they were adult friends or relatives (Arendell, 1986; Furstenberg &amp; 
Nord, 1985). In contrast, some research suggests that men who remarry and form blended 
families tend to assume greater responsibility for household labor, including stereotypical 
"feminine" chores. It is uncertain how remarriage affects men's contributions to father-
ing, but the challenges posed by blended families may broaden both expectations and 
practices. As Coltrane (1996, pp. 171-172) observed, blended families "lack normative 
prescriptions for role performance, institutionalized procedures to handle problems, and 
easily accessible social support." Thus, remarriage has the potential to liberate men and 
women from traditional expectations about household roles, allowing more opportunities 
for experimentation and change in gendered familial responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>Scholarship on gender ideology, and parenting has been criticized for its portrayals 
of homogeneous cultural prescriptions and uniform parenting practices (Baber &amp; Allen, 
1992; Joseph &amp; Lewis, 1981; Lorber, 1981; Thorne &amp; Yalom, 1992). For example, the </p>
<p/>

<p>Gender and Family Relations 397 
</p>
<p>analysis of working class Chicana/o parenting by Segura and Pierce (1993) demonstrates 
how the identity processes described by Chodorow take on a very different form in a 
community with strong norms about familism and collective responsibility for the task of 
mothering. However, while practices such as multiple female caretakers demonstrate the 
stability of alternatives to the "traditional" nuclear family in different social contexts, the 
research by Segura and Pierce also shows how those alternatives are similarly shaped and 
gender inequality is sustained by patriarchal institutions. 
</p>
<p>In an analysis of African American mothering. Hill Collins (1992) showed that 
parenting accomplished through women's reliance upon networks of female kith and kin 
provides a physical and psychic base for their children and creates strong and devoted, 
although less demonstratively affectionate, mother-daughter bonds. A daughter's "grow-
ing up means developing a better understanding that even though she may desire more 
affection and greater freedom, her mother's physical care and protection are acts of ma-
ternal love" (Hill Collins, 1992, p. 228). Hill Collins suggests that daughters' eventual 
recognition of the differences between traditional, popular notions of maternal love and 
acceptance of the reasons for stern female disciplinarians in their lives was essential to 
the development of their own identity as women and their capacity to mother. In a com-
munity where mothers are both providers and caregivers, and patriarchal norms are sec-
ondary, daughters ultimately understand that mothering brings rewards, but at a high 
personal cost. This complexity makes mothering a contradictory institution for some Af-
rican-American women, one that overtly includes ambivalence in its reproduction. 
</p>
<p>Research on parenting by gays and lesbians also provides an important comparative 
context for studying the intersection of gender ideology and practice (Patterson, 1995). 
For example, recent research explored whether deliberate efforts to avoid patriarchically 
based gender inequality in lesbian households makes a difference in the instrumental and 
affective division of labor in lesbian co-parenting practices. Sullivan (1996) found that 
when partners explicitly and self-consciously commit to gender-equitable parenting, nei-
ther parent assumed a disproportionate share of household tasks relative to the primary 
wage earner of the couple. However, when lesbian couples decided to adhere to a tradi-
tionally gendered breadwinner/primary caregiver arrangement, the stay-at-home partner 
was rendered economically vulnerable by foregoing ties to paid employment. In particu-
lar, this arrangement resulted in a noticeable decline in the stay-at-home partner's capac-
ity to influence family decisions and negotiate for her own needs associated with childcare 
and other domestic practices. The intrusion of economic dependency reaffirms, once again, 
the importance of gender and income for power and other aspects of family relations. 
</p>
<p>3. KINSHIP AND THE FAMILY UNIT 
</p>
<p>Family units are organized around marital unions or other partnering arrangements-, sib-
</p>
<p>ling relationships, and intergenerational bonds, all of which exist on the basis of blood, 
</p>
<p>legal, or fictive ties. These ties can extend beyond the immediate household to encompass 
</p>
<p>the community and beyond as kith. Taking anthropological evidence of the family's vari-
</p>
<p>ability across cultures and social groups as a point of departure (e.g., Morgan, 1870; 
</p>
<p>Stack, 1974; Weston, 1991), some of the earliest work by sociologists focused on the 
</p>
<p>boundaries of the family, particularly along intergenerational lines (Bengtson &amp; Black, 
</p>
<p>1973; Hagestad, 1981; Shanas, Townsend, Wedderburn, Friis, Milhoj, &amp; Stehouwer, 1968), 
</p>
<p>for example, by exploring the extendedness of the middle class nuclear family (Litwak, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>398 Denise D. Bielby 
</p>
<p>1960). Research on the normative and affective bases of family solidarity (Aldous &amp; Hill, 
1965; Atkinson, Kivett, &amp; Campbell, 1986; CicirelU, 1983; Di Leonardo, 1992; Roberts, 
Richards, &amp; Bengtson, 1991) clarified the unique role of women in the kin matrix. Rossi 
and Rossi's comprehensive Of Human Bonding (1990) emphasized how the mother-daugh-
ter relationship contributed "to the structure of the ties that hold families together in a 
socially embedded way" (Rossi, 1995, p. 275). 
</p>
<p>Women play a distinctive role across a range of kinship ties (Waite &amp; Harrison, 
1992), with much of the research focusing on intergenerational relations. Declining mor-
tality and fertility increase the length of time individuals spend in multigenerational 
kinship networks (Farkas &amp; Hogan, 1995). In an analysis of cross-national data collected 
in Australia, West Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Austria, Hungary, and the United States 
in the late 1980s, Farkas and Hogan affirm earlier work (Shanas et al., 1968) showing 
that residents of the United States have more frequent contact with kin after controlling 
for proximity. They also find that in all of the countries studied, women contact kin more 
frequently than men. This tendency persists after statistically controlling for availability 
of adult kin, lineage position, generational structure, and age. Farkas and Hogan also 
found that women expect to solicit help from kin more frequently than do men, regardless 
of marital status and generational composition, and that Americans expect to rely on kin 
assistance less frequently than do their counterparts in other countries. 
</p>
<p>Families are the primary providers of caregiving to elderly parents, and the respon-
sibility is gendered in its provision, type, and management (Abel, 1991). Controlling for 
the composition of the family network, sons and daughters are not interchangeable re-
sources for parent care (Coward &amp; Dwyer, 1990; Spitze &amp; Logan, 1990), and it is daugh-
ters, particularly unmarried daughters, who have a substantially higher probability of 
fulfilling the primary caregiver role (Abel, 1991; Dwyer &amp; Coward, 1991; Soldo, Wolf, &amp; 
Agree, 1990; Wolfe, Freedman, &amp; Soldo, 1997). Analysis of data from a 1982 govern-
ment survey reveals that women represent more than 70% of all caregivers to the elderly 
and over three quarters of all adult children providing care (Stone, Cafferata, &amp; Sangl, 
1987). Moreover, adult daughters constitute almost one-third of caregivers to frail eld-
erly, the most demanding type of responsibility for care to older persons because of its 
intensively emotional and physical labor (Stone et al., 1987). According to research cited 
by Abel (1991, p. 5; also see Pavalko &amp; Artis, 1997), the strategies for incorporating 
caregiving for elders into other work and family responsibilities is gendered (that is, 
daughters relinquish paid employment, rearrange their schedules, and take time off with-
out pay, while sons reduced the number of hours devoted to parental care), and daughters 
who provide support to elders receive less assistance themselves from other family mem-
bers than sons who assist elderly parents. Because of increased life expectancy, contem-
porary women can expect to spend more years caring for elderly parents than they do 
rearing children (Watkins, Menken, &amp; Bongaarts, 1987). 
</p>
<p>Family assistance norms and their implementation vary depending on the type of 
family ethos organizing kin networks. Pyke and Bengtson (1996) place family belief 
systems on a continuum ranging from individualistic to collectivistic. "Individualistic" 
families view caregiving as burdensome labor, and are more likely to rely on formal 
institutional supports. "Collectivistic" families are more likely to view caregiving as a 
joint familial responsibility and avoid formal sources of assistance. Although not volumi-
nous, some studies address the degree to which caregiving strategies are gendered and 
the extent to which they differ by race, ethnicity, and social class. For example, a small </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>body of research on support resources in African-American families shows that adult 
daughters, in particular, are most often selected as an informal helper to older parents 
(see e.g.. Chatters &amp; Jayakody, 1995; Chatters, Taylor, &amp; Jackson, 1986), but little is 
known about how these practices are affected by socioeconomic status, or the occupa-
tional mobility of African-American daughters (Wharton &amp; Thome, 1997). The often-
assumed dysfunctionality of embedded family ties that characterize Hispanic families has 
been challenged by Tienda, who has shown how the presence of extended kin encourages 
creative income strategies to cope with economic hardship. In particular, extended kin 
facilitate the labor force participation of women by assuming caregiving responsibilities 
and relieving other domestic burdens (Tienda &amp; Angel, 1982; Tienda &amp; Glass, 1985; see 
also Hurtado, 1995). The norm of patrilineally organized filial piety underlying families 
of Asian origin and descent is well documented (Sung, 1990), but there is evidence that 
daughters are the preferred caregivers, even in the face of strong patrilineal family ideals 
(Rindfuss, Liao, &amp; Tsuya, 1994). 
</p>
<p>These findings affirm Rossi's claim that as child-rearers, caregivers, and kin keep-
ers, "women are the unsung heroines of social integration" (Rossi, 1995, p. 275). They 
also illustrate the bind in which women find themselves as, on the one hand, they per-
form the duties and obligations that provide for, protect, and maintain the dignity of 
vulnerable family members, while on the other hand, they encumber themselves in ways 
many find stressful (Brody, 1981) or oppressive (Aronson, 1992). The matter of care for 
family elders is just one component of an emerging feminist debate about the sharing of 
rights and responsibility of care between men and women (see Aronson, 1992). 
</p>
<p>4. GENDER, POWER, AND FAMILY RELATIONS 
</p>
<p>In any domestic relationship, an unequal division of labor in household and paid work 
shapes the relative power each partner has to pursue her or his interests. Social exchange 
theory (Emerson, 1976), applied to couples' decision-making (Blood &amp; Wolfe, 1960) and 
marital conflict (Scanzoni, 1970), reveals how financial resources provide leverage in 
bargaining between spouses; the partner with the greater earning capacity is consistently 
better able to pursue his or her self-interest (Blumstein &amp; Schwartz, 1983; Duncan &amp; 
Duncan, 1978). 
</p>
<p>Exchange theory is gender neutral in its treatment of power in domestic relation-
ships. Gender differences in the distribution of resources and in alternative opportunities 
are exogenous; whichever partner happens to have greater resources and better alterna-
tives brings more power to the relationship. Research motivated by feminist concerns 
shows how gender ideology and gendered institutions shape exchange within domestic 
relationships (Pyke, 1996). For example, as noted previously, England suggested that 
women are more likely to invest in relationship-specific skills, placing them at a disad-
vantage relative to partners whose skills and resources are unaffected by the dissolution 
of an intimate relationship (England &amp; Kilbourne, 1990). England also emphasized the 
effects of a cultural ideology that devalues traditionally female work and encourages women 
to altruistically pursue joint familial interests rather than personal self-interest [what 
Heimer (1996) refers to more appropriately as a normatively prescribed obligation rather 
than altruism]. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, Bielby and Bielby (1992) showed that gender ideology introduces asym-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>400 Denise D. Bielby 
</p>
<p>metry in husbands' and wives' decisions about relocating for a better job. That research 
tested the neoclassical economic model of family migration decisions among dual-earner 
couples (Mincer, 1978). The neoclassical model is also gender neutral: both husbands 
and wives should be unwilling to relocate if doing so disrupts a spouse's career and fails 
to improve the economic well-being of the family. Accordingly, the model predicts that 
all else constant, one's willingness to move for a better job will be negatively related to 
the spouse's current income. In fact, contrary to the predictions of the neoclassical model, 
willingness to relocate for a better job was highly contingent on both gender and gender-
role beliefs. Women behaved as predicted by the model: the higher their husband's earn-
ings, the less willing they were to relocate for a better job for themselves. In contrast, 
traditional males&mdash;those who believed in the primacy of a husband's role as provider and 
who disapproved of employed mothers&mdash;were not influenced at all by their wives' earn-
ings. Instead, they gave primacy to their own careers or overall family well-being. How-
ever, not all placed their own career interests ahead of those of other family members. 
Men who rejected traditional gender-role ideology were deterred from relocating if their 
spouses were in well-paid jobs, although even these men were less sensitive to disruption 
of their spouses' careers than were employed wives under comparable circumstances. 
These findings suggest the extent to which the household division of labor is negotiated 
around symbols of masculinity and femininity (see Brines, 1993; Goffman, 1977) and is 
contingent on the degree to which spouses hold themselves accountable to cultural defini-
tions of gender (see also Blumstein &amp; Schwartz, 1983; Bolak, 1997; Pyke &amp; Coltrane, 
1996; Thompson, 1991). 
</p>
<p>One promising way of disentangling the effect of gendered institutions and, specifi-
cally, notions of masculinity, upon family relations is to compare decision-making and 
power among heterosexual, lesbian, and gay couples (Kurdek, 1993). Blumstein and 
Schwartz (1983) find that the relationship between earnings capacity and power was 
greatest among gay couples and lowest among lesbians, suggesting that culturally de-
fined notions of masculinity shape power dynamics. Sullivan (1996) finds some circum-
stances under which lesbian couples have a seemingly traditional division of labor, but 
she claims these arrangements are truly the result of rational calculations, uncontami-
nated by gender ideology or cultural notions of provider roles. While the findings of these 
different studies are not fully consistent with one another, they offer insights about gendered 
institutions not found in studies limited to heterosexual relationships. 
</p>
<p>Gender, relative power, and perceived inequity are central to the duration of mar-
riage and other domestic partnerships. In an analysis of heterosexual marriage, England 
and Farkas (1986) conceptualize marriage as an implicit contract. Exogenous social, 
cultural, and economic factors, including gender role socialization and labor market dis-
crimination, create a domestic division of labor in which men have greater bargaining 
power relative to women. Specifically, men's tendency to avoid relationship-specific in-
vestments not only frees them to accumulate resources, primarily in the form of earning 
power, that they may transfer to another partner, it also buys them greater bargaining 
power regarding their own interests within the relationship itself. Women's dependent 
ties on men explain their greater acceptance of gender inequality, especially in the home. 
Men's gendered interests, and privilege, and the relative power that assures them domi-
nance, encourages them to accept domestic inequality. 
</p>
<p>However, the power imbalance within marriage has changed for two reasons. First, 
men's bargaining advantage decreases with women's earnings capacity outside the home. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Family Relations 401 
</p>
<p>Second, if the emphasis on love and emotion in marriage is increasing, then women's 
bargaining power is enhanced precisely because women are seen as uniquely qualified to 
bring those qualities to a marriage (England &amp; Farkas, 1986). If the balance of power 
within marriage is becoming less unequal, then women should be becoming better posi-
tioned both to leave relationships that are not fully satisfying and to voice their concerns 
about inequities within marital relationships. In short, the dynamics of family life have 
been altered by women's increased standing in the labor force, creating options for women 
that have always existed for men: "exit" (i.e., divorce), and "voice" (i.e., bargaining or 
demands for change in the marital relationship), in addition to "loyalty" to traditional 
domestic arrangements (England &amp; Kilbourne, 1990). 
</p>
<p>The relationship between women's labor force participation, earnings, and marital 
dissolution is well documented (Martin &amp; Bumpass, 1989; Goldscheider &amp; Waite, 1991). 
Recent research also suggests that women's increased power within marriage has indeed 
contributed to a greater tendency to voice concerns about inequities within relationships. 
For example, research shows that perceived equity in the division of household labor and 
childcare, particularly among dual-earner couples, is an important determinant of mari-
tal satisfaction (White, 1983; Yogev &amp; Brett, 1985), and disagreements on these issues 
lead to dissatisfaction and marital instability (Booth, Johnson, White, &amp; Edwards, 1984). 
In addition, the more housework the husband does, the lower the chances are that the 
wife has considered divorce (Huber &amp; Spitze, 1983). Goldscheider and Waite (1991) 
found that husbands use their earnings to "buy" out of sharing household tasks, while 
wives use their earnings to "buy" increased participation by their husbands.' Gender-
linked solutions such as these are so deep seated that when domestic confrontations occur 
over inequities, spouses even disagree on the extent of their disagreements (Benis &amp; 
Agostinelli, 1988). Criticism of perceived gender inequality at home and at work is higher, 
on average, among women than among men, but at the same time, consistent with 
England's analysis, married women are less critical than single women of men's propen-
sity not to share more equally in household responsibilities (Kane &amp; Sanchez, 1994; see 
also Kane, 1994). Thus, from an institutionalist perspective, cultural scripts about mar-
riage appear to be in a state of flux (Barich &amp; Bielby, 1996), and both discourse and 
practice are shaping new understandings about marriage and domestic relationships. 
</p>
<p>5. AGENCY, GENDER IDEOLOGY, AND FAMILY RELATIONS 
</p>
<p>To this point, my analysis of gender and family relations has emphasized the ways in 
which practices within the social institution of the family are shaped by gender norms 
and ideologies. I observed how those practices, centered on the provision of care and 
caregiving, are affected by prevailing beliefs about masculinity and femininity and by 
other exogenous factors such as waged labor, and how they vary by differences in cultural 
contexts. An institutionalist lens has allowed consideration of how both prevailing social 
scripts that prescribe family life, and symbolic displays and enactments of gender, so-
cially construct the family (Barich &amp; Bielby, 1996). 
</p>
<p>In particular, institutionalist analysis focuses attention on the taken-for-granted na-
</p>
<p>' Goldscheider and Waite (1991, p. 277) clarify that absolute levels of earnings, as well as education, have a greater 
</p>
<p>effect on the division of household labor than do relative earnings. </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>ture of gender as an organizing feature of family relations. Taken-for-grantedness is the 
practical knowledge comprising shared understandings of social reality (Zucker, 1991), 
and taken-for-granted notions of action within the family fundamentally organize the 
gendered enactment of roles, behaviors, and expectations of household members. The 
practical knowledge that systematizes individuals' shared understandings of men's and 
women's place within the family also organizes expectations of what constitutes the fam-
ily and how it is accomplished. One of the most fundamental notions of domestic ar-
rangements is that they must be gendered to be enacted; many analyses go no further than 
considering how they are gendered. 
</p>
<p>Institutionalist analysis also recognizes the reality of members' agency. Causality 
does not operate in just one direction; practices and institutions are reciprocally related. 
Family members' practices modify the institutionalized scripts of gendered domestic life, 
sometimes by default, when there are no "legitimate" scripts for unconventional lifestyle 
choices. However, scholars are just beginning to appreciate the importance of developing 
theory and research to examine how agency operates as a causal force in institutional 
change. From its inception, feminist scholarship on the family has made note of the 
reality of multiple discourses and varied practices, but has lacked a conceptual frame-
work for specifying how this diversity modifies family as an institution and ideology (see 
Glenn, 1987). We know that although constrained by dominant institutions and ideolo-
gies, family members experiment with and invent new strategies for dealing with the 
everyday challenges of domestic life. In doing so, they open up a space for new discourse 
about what constitutes legitimate practice within families, and even what constitutes a 
family. One recent treatment of this issue includes Weston's (1991) study of how lesbian 
and gay domestic arrangements redefine kinship networks. This work challenges the 
"opposite gender model" of parenthood and kinship relations, which views kinship rela-
tions as determined solely on the basis of blood (consanguinity) or marriage (affinity). 
</p>
<p>Another is Gubrium and Holstein's (1990, 1993; Holstein &amp; Gubrium, 1995) analy-
sis of the family that responds to scholars who decry the "disappearance" of the family 
(Popenoe, 1993; Smelser, 1980). In conceptualizing "family," they shift emphasis away 
from defining it as a specific set of social relationships that take place only within house-
holds. They argue that it should also include relationships that take place in settings 
where family activity routinely extends, such as nursing homes, daycare centers, and 
residential treatment facilities.^ On the one hand, Gubrium and Holstein acknowledge 
the power of the notion of "family" as it relates to the sentiments associated with the 
private space of house and home. On the other hand, they place in the foreground mem-
bers' sentiments, in particular feelings, values, and commitments, as well as their activi-
ties and the meanings those actions create (Gubrium &amp; Holstein, 1990). The enactment 
of family relations as a set of practices becomes the primary focus. 
</p>
<p>While this expanded conceptualization allows a more diverse range of practices to 
be subsumed under the concepts of "family" and "family relations," it is important to 
recognize that gender is still enacted, even in domestic arrangements that depart from the 
traditional heterosexual nuclear family. Gender ideologies still legitimate relations of 
power and the division of emotional and physical labor, however differently those rela-
tions are configured. 
</p>
<p>' Going a step further, Hochschild (1997) has suggested that family-like relationships and bonds extend into the 
</p>
<p>workplace and may indeed supplant those that take place in domestic units. </p>

<p>Gender and Education

<p>in Global Perspective

</p>
<p>Education is a key institution for understanding gender in society because it mirrors 
</p>
<p>social relationships in societies as well as being a fulcrum for struggles and changes 
</p>
<p>occurring within them. Is education a source of liberation, empowerment, and advance-
</p>
<p>ment for women, as liberal feminists tend to assume, or does education tend to reproduce 
</p>
<p>gender inequalities in society, as some gender-centered theorists argue? Our thesis is that 
</p>
<p>education both empowers women and reproduces gender inequalities. The question is. In 
</p>
<p>what ways and in what situations is education liberating and when is it more likely to 
</p>
<p>reproduce unequal power relations between men and women? This more general concern 
</p>
<p>with gender and education raises two distinct but interrelated questions: (1) What is the 
</p>
<p>relationship between gender and educational access, experiences, achievement, and at-
</p>
<p>tainment? and (2) Does education affect gender equity in society, and if so, how? We 
</p>
<p>address the first question in Sections 1 and 2 of this chapter, and the third in Section 3. 
</p>
<p>Historically, women's limited social roles were reflected in their highly restricted 
</p>
<p>access to education. As societies changed and as women and cross-national influences 
</p>
<p>shaped conceptions of the state and citizenship, the education of women began to change

<p>as well. Early efforts focused on gaining literacy and access to education, issues that 
remain alive in many countries. Universal access to education, at least through primary 
schooling, is an official goal of most states in the world today, and the vast majority of 
educational institutions are state supported and run. Thus, education represents the one 
universal experience of official political and social philosophy for large numbers of citi-
zens. As a vehicle of intentional public policy, it reflects the state of gender relations in a 
society as well as providing a potential pressure point for change. 
</p>
<p>It may not be surprising that the relationship between education and gender is com-
plex, paradoxical, and interacts with other factors. Perhaps more than any other social 
institution, education operates simultaneously to privilege and constrain individuals in a 
society by both producing and maintaining, as well as challenging and changing gender 
inequality at all levels of social life (see, e.g., Collins, 1990). Education does not operate 
the same way for all individuals in a society, but depends on their social locations in the 
matrix of gender, class, ethnic, and other axes of stratification in a society, as well as on 
the global location of a particular society with respect to economic, political, and military 
power and resources. Education offers opportunities for exposure to new knowledge and 
resources and the possibility of obtaining passkeys to new statuses, but it may also repro-
duce gender (and other) stratified values, attitudes, and behaviors. 
</p>
<p>In reviewing the research on gender and education we have been struck by several 
points. First, much of the early research on education ignored gender both in the United 
States (Grant, Horan, &amp; Watts-Warren, 1994) and in Great Britain (Acker &amp; David, 
1994; Delamont, 1996). Second, where gender is included, it is often simply as another 
variable, rather than as a central theoretical focus, although publications by Mickelson 
(1989) and Wrigley (1992) are important exceptions to this statement. Differences in the 
way gender is conceptualized are reflected in the theoretical perspectives that guide re-
search, as we explicate in each section. 
</p>
<p>1. GENDER PARITY IN EDUCATIONAL ACCESS AND ATTAINMENT 
</p>
<p>In the United States, studies of educational access and attainment have tended to be 
framed by human capital, status attainment, or class reproduction approaches. The hu-
man capital perspective begins with the microeconomic assumption that social and eco-
nomic events result from the individual decisions of rational actors (Becker, 1964, 1967). 
Individual decisions, such as obtaining more education, are the key shapers of labor mar-
ket positions and pay and hence of social and economic inequality. While demographic 
factors such as gender, race, and urban/rural location are acknowledged as affecting rates 
of return to education, they are seen as outside the social processes of interest rather than 
as central features. Yet even recent research suggests that the higher the college wage 
premium, the more likely men are to attend college, while women's decisions are less 
affected by higher wage premiums (Averett &amp; Burton, 1996). Human capital theory fails 
to consider that the "rational choices" of parents and students are heavily constrained by 
the social fields in which they are embedded, and that gender is a defining element of 
those situations. 
</p>
<p>Human capital theory has been incorporated sociologically in functionalist techno-
cratic-meritocratic theories of status attainment, which model how individuals attain 
occupations of different status (Sewell &amp; Hauser, 1975). Many early studies in this tradi-
tion excluded women from analysis. Later studies that included women (e.g., Alexander </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Education in Global Perspective 409 
</p>
<p>&amp; Eckland, 1974 and Marini, 1980) found that the model had less predictive power for 
women and African-Americans than it did for men or whites. Like human capital theory, 
the status attainment model assumes that differential outcomes are due to deficits on the 
part of individuals or members of certain groups, rather than to any systemic deficits. 
Moreover, this model overlooks the ways that societal and family differences affect the 
types and levels of education people attain. The assumption is that men and women have 
similar experiences in schools, and the perspective fails to consider that gender inequali-
ties may produce educational inequalities. 
</p>
<p>Among feminist theories, liberal feminism bears some resemblance to the human 
capital and status attainment perspectives. Liberal feminism tends to assume a just social 
system, with deviations from equality due to incorrect socialization, lack of information, 
and/or the absence of corrective legislation. The state is considered a benevolent institu-
tion that can design and implement legislation to ensure gender equity. Like functional-
ists, liberal feminists find it difficult to explain the source of discrimination toward women 
and their unequal socialization, except to say that discrimination is a residue of an earlier 
era that has not yet been overcome by the state. Much of the research on access to educa-
tion has been conducted within a liberal feminist framework, for example, quantitative 
studies of literacy, educational access, enrollment and graduation rates, programs of study, 
and achievement. The liberal feminist framework has been criticized by Stromquist (1989), 
who suggests that a "symbiotic relationship may emerge between family and state to 
preserve the unequal social and educational chances of women" (1989, p. 171). For ex-
ample, historically colonial educational authorities in Africa cooperated with conserva-
tive and patriarchal indigenous leaders in Senegal (Barthel, 1985), Congo (Yates, 1982), 
and Kenya (Kay, 1979). 
</p>
<p>A common question shared by all perspectives is whether gender is a barrier to equal 
educational access. Historically, the ideal of equal access to education for men and women 
is relatively new. In the United States, for example, as recently as the 1830s, women's 
education was severely restricted and vastly inferior to that of men (Curti, 1935/1968, p. 
53). Oberlin College was founded in 1833 and was the first institution of higher educa-
tion to admit both men and women. However, women studied in the "Ladies Course," a 
subcollege program, under close supervision, and they were segregated from men (Sadker 
&amp; Sadker, 1994, p. 21). U.S. women comprised 21% of undergraduates in 1870, 40% in 
1910, and 47% in 1920, before their numbers declined in the 1950s (Graham, 1978). 
</p>
<p>Worldwide there is currently a trend toward increasing numerical gender parity in 
educational access at all levels of education, from basic literacy to higher education, with 
only a few notable exceptions. Despite this trend, however, women have achieved nu-
merical parity in only a few regions of the world. Women today face a different educa-
tional reality than their mothers and grandmothers, but in many parts of the world even 
numerical gender parity in educational access has not been fully achieved. While access 
is measured different ways, here we use literacy and enrollment rates in secondary and 
higher education. 
</p>
<p>1.1. Literacy 
</p>
<p>In every region of the world, a smaller percentage of women compared to men are liter-
ate. Nearly three quarters of women aged 25 and older in sub-Saharan Africa are illiter-
ate, nearly 60% in the Middle East, 37% in Asia, 21% in South America and the Carribean, 
7% in Europe, and 3% in the United States (Fig. 19-1).' Although male illiteracy is </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>410 Caroline Hodges Persell ET AL. 
</p>
<p>similarly distributed in these regions, illiteracy among women is consistently higher (Fig. 
19-1). The gender gap in literacy has been shrinking over time, however, and is smaller 
among younger cohorts (those aged 15 to 24) than among those 25 and over. Among 
women aged 15 to 24, illiteracy drops to 46% in sub-Saharan Africa, 24% in the Middle 
East, 21% in Asia, 8% in South America and the Carribean (about the same as men's), 
and about 1% in Europe and the United States (Fig. 19-1). Thus, literacy rates are rising 
for both men and women and the gender gap in literacy is declining, but gender parity 
even in basic literacy has not yet been achieved. 
</p>
<p>1.2. Secondary Education 
</p>
<p>In some regions and countries, namely sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Eu-
rope, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, women are underrepresented in secondary 
education compared to men (Fig. 19-2, darker bar). In South America, the Carribean, and 
the United States, however, the proportions of women are equal to or greater than those of 
men in secondary education. 
</p>
<p>1.3. Higher (Tertiary) Education 
</p>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Asia women are underrepresented in higher 
education compared to men (Fig. 19-2, lighter bar). However, in South America, the 
Carribean, Europe, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada the propor-
tions of women are equal to or greater than those of men in higher education. The United 
States has the highest female-male enrollment ratio in higher education (115), although 
Latin America and the Caribbean are a close second at 112 (Fig. 19-2). What these gen-
eralized ratios hide is that some individual countries in Latin America and the Caribbean 
have substantially higher ratios, some of which are among the highest in the world; for 
example, Bahamas (216), Jamaica (149), and St. Vincent (209). Several countries in the 
Middle East, for example, Saudi Arabia, also have high female-to-male ratios in higher 
education. Consistent with illiteracy rates and secondary female-male enrollment ratios, 
sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest ratio (36). 
</p>
<p>A possible explanation for the extremely high ratios in the Caribbean is that very 
different job opportunities exist for men and women. Men can earn relatively high wages 
in jobs not needing secondary education, including cab driving, construction, or other 
blue-collar work. Women need more education to enter somewhat higher paying office 
and governmental jobs, the main alternative to low-paying female jobs such as house-
keeping. [For more on the school adaptations of West Indian young men and women see 
Gibson on St. Croix (1991), Foner (1973) on Jamaica, and Brown (1978, cited in Gibson, 
1991) on the Bahamas.] In the Middle East, possible explanations may be that males are 
sent abroad for schooling or are likely to inherit the family business and thus do not need 
higher education, while education is socially acceptable for women until they marry. In 
</p>
<p>' These results should be interpreted with caution. All data come from United Nations sources. Behrman and 
</p>
<p>Rosenzweig find that studies using time series of cross-country data to look at the impact of education, "make little 
</p>
<p>or no effort to evaluate the quality of the data" (1994, p. 148). Information provided by individual countries is 
</p>
<p>subject to many intertemporal and inter-country comparability problems. Data quality concerns come from many 
</p>
<p>sources, including countries using different definitions and data collecting instruments, estimating instead of actu-
</p>
<p>ally calculating figures, and using flawed instruments to collect data. In addition, gaps in data are not handled in 
</p>
<p>consistent ways by countries. For a complete discussion, see Behrman and Rosenzweig (1994). </p>

</p>
<p>1.4. Explanations for the Gender Gap and Trends in Educational Access 
</p>
<p>Can we explain why gender disparities in educational access are greater in some coun- 
</p>
<p>tries compared to others, why they favor women in a few countries, why gender differ- 
</p>
<p>ences are declining almost everywhere, and where and why they are increasing? Both 
</p>
<p>structural and cultural factors are important. Structurally, the percentage of a population 
</p>
<p>in agriculture is the single biggest factor correlated with gender disparities in access. 
</p>
<p>This is highly related to the resources a country possesses and can spend on education, to 
</p>
<p>urbanization, and to the availability of labor markets requiring educational credentials. 
</p>
<p>Structural factors are related (although not perfectly) to cultural conditions as well. Re- 
</p>
<p>ceptivity to Western cultural ideals of citizenship and individualism and openess to so- 
</p>
<p>called modern rather than traditional values and norms seems to foster greater gender 
</p>
<p>equity in educational access, which may explain the shrinking gender gap in educational 
</p>
<p>access even in some agricultural countries. Islam and other patriarchal ideologies and 
</p>
<p>practices such as female genital mutilation may be related to low rates of educational </p>

<p>parity, although it is difficult to obtain systematic data on such practices. The one country 
where gender inequities in access are increasing is Afghanistan, where a tenuous revolu-
tionary fundamentalist Islamic government has decreed that women should not work or 
attend school outside the home. 
</p>
<p>The few countries where women's rates of educational access exceed those of men 
suggest two different explanations. In the United States and some Caribbean and Latin 
American countries, growing opportunities in the labor market for women appear to be 
related to their avid pursuit of education. There is also little resistance in those countries 
to Western ideologies. Those Middle Eastern countries where women outnumber men in 
secondary or higher education suggest the anomalous possibility that while access may be 
equal, the content or consequences of education are not necessarily equal. While such 
countries have expanded access, they have done so by developing gender-segregated school-
ing and courses of study. They have rejected many Western ideologies and forms, while 
reaffirming traditional, heavily patriarchal ideologies and practices. 
</p>
<p>These broad structural and cultural conditions interact with features of educational 
design that may also affect numerical gender parity. For instance, is there universal, 
compulsory, and free education? If so, through what ages? How stringently is attendance 
enforced? World agencies such as UNESCO acknowledge that reliance on literacy and 
enrollment rates ignores potentially pertinent issues such as rates of absenteeism and </p>

</p>
<p>dropout (United Nations, 1995a). Stromquist (1989) and Finn, Dulberg, and Reis (1979) 
review studies suggesting that women worldwide are often more likely than men to be 
absent from and drop out of school. 
</p>
<p>In the absence of strong state support for universal attendance, families may press 
girls into household work (Kelly, 1987). For lower-income families especially, sending 
girls to school is likely to be seen as an economic strain, especially when education is not 
free. Families may sacrifice to send boys to school but may succumb to cultural norms 
about a woman's place in society and the limited economic opportunities for women after 
completing formal education. The sexual division of labor in many countries may lead to 
girls being kept at home disproportionately for housekeeping, child-minding, and even 
income-earning activities (Kelly, 1987). 
</p>
<p>In 1990 in all countries, the percentage of the population in agriculture is strongly 
and positively related to the percent of younger females (ages 15 to 24) who are illiterate 
(Table 19-1, column 1). This finding is consistent with reports that girls living in urban 
areas are more likely to attend school and be literate than girls living in rural areas. 
Urban young women are two to three times more likely to be literate than young women 
in rural areas, and sometimes more (United Nations, 1995a). Stromquist suggests that 
one reason for this may be the "social norms controlling the sexuality of women" (1989, 
p. 160). Throughout the world women's sexuality is repressed and channeled toward 
motherhood (Stromquist, 1992). The desire to control women's sexuality is clearly evi-
dent in the practice of female genital mutilation, which is more likely in rural areas. 
Negative attitudes toward the education of women suggest that their education may be 
perceived as a threat to male dominance. In rural areas, schools are also likely to be 
further from children's homes than in urban areas, thus increasing the chances that girls 
will be out of range of parental supervision. Research in Bangladesh, Cameroon, India, 
Sierra Leone, Vanuatu, and Jamaica found that rural location was associated with nega-
tive attitudes about females going to school (Cammish, 1993). Niles (1989) found that 
rural parents in Nigeria also have unfavorable attitudes toward female education and the 
long distance girls have to travel to school was a deterrent in Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea, 
Kenya, Mali, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe (Brock &amp; Cammish, 1997; Hon, 
1992; Kane, 1995; and Odaga &amp; Ward, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Among women over 25, the percentage of women in the labor force is also nega-
tively and significantly related to illiteracy rates (Table 19-1, column 2), suggesting that 
countries where women experience greater opportunity to participate in the paid labor 
force provide reasons for them to become literate. 
</p>
<p>The percentage of the population in agriculture is the largest and only significant 
variable related to the ratio of women to men in both secondary and higher education 
(Table 19-1, columns 3 and 4). A case study of women who achieved higher education in 
Malawi, one of the 25 least-developed countries in the Third World, revealed that a strong 
motivating factor was the women's desire to obtain professional wage-earning careers (Pow-
ers, 1995). Another factor was the important role of single-sex secondary schools in fostering 
the academic achievement and educational attainment of the women (Powers, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Bradley and Ramirez (1996) analyzed the social correlates of the expansion of 
women's share of higher education from 1965 to 1985. In a multivariate analysis of 90 
nations, they found several factors that are significantly related to gains in women's share, 
including the size of the gender gap in 1965. Countries with bigger gender gaps in 1965 
made larger gains by 1985, perhaps, they suggest, because of the increasing prevalence of 
a strong, transnational norm of relative gender parity. They also found that countries with </p>

<p>systems of higher education founded since 1965 had greater increases in women's share 
of higher education than countries with older systems. Level of economic development in 
1965 had a strong positive effect on growth in women's share of higher education in 
economically developing countries, but not in more developed countries. The authority of 
the state had positive and significant effects on the growth in women's share of higher 
education in economically developing countries, but not in more developed ones. Finally, 
having a population that was 80% or more Islamic was negatively related to increasing 
women's share of higher education in economically developing countries. Their models 
explain more than half the variance in developing countries and just under half the vari-
ance in more economically developed countries. 
</p>
<p>The negative effect of large Islamic populations is consistent with some feminist 
theories that suggest that women's subordination arises from unequal power relations 
based on different reproductive roles, around which an ideological system of patriarchy is 
constructed that infuses the family and education. The state is a "key agent" in perpetuat-
ing women's subordination, by defending mothers and families, while relegating them to 
a private sphere separate from the public sphere. Schools also transmit patriarchal ide-
ologies in the way they construct and control sexuality. In countries where the state is 
unwilling to challenge the tradition of female genital mutilation, the state institution of 
education may be less willing to challenge women's subordinate position in society more 
generally. The traditional Islamic country, Saudi Arabia, has a dual system of male and </p>

<p>Gender and Education in Global Perspective 415 
</p>
<p>female education and gender-segregated schools and colleges with gender-specific cur-
ricula emphasizing women's domestic functions (El-Sanabary, 1994). 
</p>
<p>1.5. Summary 
</p>
<p>In terms of literacy and numerical enrollment, gender parity has not yet been achieved in 
all areas of the world, but there is a general tendency toward greater numerical parity, 
particularly among younger women. 
</p>
<p>A notable feature of cross-national research on gender and education is that it shifts 
the unit of analysis from individuals to countries, thus breaking somewhat from the indi-
vidualistic focus of human capital and status attainment approaches. Some efforts, nota-
bly that by Bradley and Ramirez (1996), have begun to analyze how political, economic, 
and cultural features of societies are related to increasing gender parity in access to higher 
education. 
</p>
<p>The focus on equal access assumes that education is a gender-neutral institution, a 
condition that seems unlikely in gender-stratified societies. Numerical parity alone is an 
incomplete measure of gender equity because numerical presence is only a threshold 
condition in the complicated mosaic of potential opportunities and constraints. The next 
question is, What happens inside the schoolroom door? This question goes beyond the 
point of numerical parity, into what might be called experiential gender equity in educa-
tion. Therefore, we need to consider whether and how educational systems may reflect or 
resist the inequalities in society and/or participate in the construction of gender norms, 
thereby helping to create and reproduce gender inequalities or to reduce them. 
</p>
<p>2. GENDER AND EXPERIENCES WITHIN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS 
</p>
<p>The experiences that girls and boys have in schools are seen as important by various 
theorists, although for somewhat different reasons. Liberal feminists, with their focus on 
the individual level of analysis and action, see gender as one of many statuses that indi-
viduals occupy, but by no means their master status. Hence, they seek to know whether 
women receive equal treatment within schools, just as they may consider similar ques-
tions with regard to race and social class. They ask whether boys and girls receive equal 
encouragement from peers and teachers and whether they participate equally in all school 
and extracurricular activities, such as class discussions, sports, school governance, and 
curriculum. They also focus attention on the availability of male and female role models, 
equal representation in educational materials, equal access to educational resources, equal 
social relationships, classroom practices, and equal protection from sexual harassment. 
The assumption within the liberal feminist paradigm is that educational institutions have 
the potential to be gender-neutral institutions, if only they can function fairly. Research 
in this tradition tends to rely most heavily on survey or other forms of quantitative re-
search, which depict the large contours of the educational landscape and the distributions 
of young men and women within it. 
</p>
<p>In contrast, more gender-centered theories begin with the assumption that all social 
institutions are organized around gender relations (Acker, 1992; Grant et al., 1994) and 
hence it is unlikely that schools will operate in a gender-neutral way. Such theories not 
only conceive of gender as a master, or dominant, status but they go beyond an individu-</p>

</p>
<p>alistic, trait-like conception of gender, to focus on gender as a system of deeply rooted and 
unequal social relations that affects all aspects of social life. At least two versions of 
gender-centered theories can be identified (Anderson, 1993; Grant et al., 1994), namely 
gender difference theories, called cultural feminism by Hansot (1993), and gender pro-
cess theories. Concerning education. Grant et al. note, "Gender difference theorists some-
times argue that educational institutions&mdash;and the content and form of knowledge it-
self&mdash;is masculine, with women having at best marginal status in universities and the 
knowledge-production enterprise. To achieve success within such domains, women have 
to distort their 'feminine' approaches to conform to masculine curriculums, pedagogical 
forms, substantive interests, and interaction styles" (1994, p. 91). Research conducted 
within this framework relies primarily on critical ethnographies, narratives, and other 
tools that seek to analyze women's lives on their own terms (see, e.g., Reinharz, 1992). 
</p>
<p>From this perspective, the liberal feminist ideal of equal educational opportunities 
with men would not meet the needs of women. Cultural feminists argue that women's 
distinctive gender attributes should be encouraged by appropriately different educational 
experiences. For them, equitable gender relations in education might require periods of 
single-sex education, different curricular content, and other gender-specific experiences. 
</p>
<p>Like gender difference theorists, gender process theorists also put gender at the cen-
ter of sociological analysis but they see gender as more mutable and variable in different 
contexts and for members of different classes, races, and ages. They direct attention to 
educational institutions as arenas within which gender is constructed, and stress that 
much of this engendering activity occurs within peer relations and activities that lie largely 
beyond the control of school authorities. Drawing on resistance theory in educational 
research more broadly, this approach focuses on cultural creation by young people, some-
times in opposition to formal school ideologies. 
</p>
<p>Social reproduction and resistance theories do not accept gender and other social 
categories as "given," but rather seek to explain how such statuses and inequalities are 
produced and reproduced over time (Holland &amp; Eisenhart, 1990). In so doing, they bridge 
the gap between macro-level theories of gendered social systems and gender process theory 
that highlights the agency of individual actors. In Holland and Eisenhart's Educated in 
Romance (1990), social reproduction and resistance theories are used to explain the ways 
women in universities participate in the construction of gender norms. 
</p>
<p>Gender theorists agree widely that education is an important socializing institution 
and a key gate-keeping or credentialing institution. Hence they agree that it is worth 
examining what happens within schools and how gender interacts with educational expe-
riences. Here we consider seven features of the within-school experience, namely: peer 
interactions, teacher-student interactions, staffing patterns, curricula, Women's Studies 
programs, single-sex and coeducational schooling, and achievement. Cross-national re-
search on educational experiences within schools is much more difficult to find than 
research within the United States. Therefore, we refer to research conducted in other 
countries when we have found it, while noting the difficulty of achieving a truly global 
perspective on these issues. 
</p>
<p>2.1. Informal and Peer Interactions 
</p>
<p>Peer interactions are important sites where gender roles are constructed and reinforced. 
Even among 4- and 5-year-olds, research suggests that boys bring different styles of play </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Education in Global Perspective 417 
</p>
<p>and different mythic elements into schools than do girls. Jordan and Cowan (1995) find 
that Australian kindergarten boys learn about masculinity from warrior narratives about 
knights, superheros, and other "good guys" who can use violence legitimately when in-
volved in a struggle between good and evil. The authors trace the struggle enacted in peer 
play between the warrior narrative and the school's conception of masculinity as rational-
ity, responsibility, and commitment to civil society and the social contract. Given this 
conflict, the warrior narrative must be disguised, go underground, or get expressed within 
the realm of sports, since violence, shouting, and running are banned within the class-
room. Girls, on the other hand, face no such conflict between the conceptions of feminin-
ity with which they enter and what is acceptable within the school. The authors suggest 
that the conflict between larger societal narratives and school rules compels boys to trans-
form their warrior urges, with social dominance over girls being one possible compensa-
tion. Studies such as this illustrate how social reproduction theory sees schools and their 
students as active negotiators of gender identities that prevail in the larger society. 
</p>
<p>Other studies underscore how gender may become more sharply differentiated in 
peer-mediated play than in classrooms, although adults may contribute to the formation 
of gender relationships, for example, with the forms of address they use ("boys and girls") 
and in their sorting of children for various activities (Thome, 1993). Studying 9- to 11-
year-old children in the United States, Thome and Luria (1986) analyze how gender 
relationships form. Sex-segregated arrangements in middle childhood play time serve as 
contexts for learning gender roles and boundaries. Boys interact in larger and more vis-
ible groups, play outside more, and use more space. They show more aggressive behavior 
and develop more hierarchical and competitive relations. Girls play in smaller groups or 
pairs, and stress cooperation. Boys are more likely than girls to challenge school mles, 
for example, regarding the use of dirty words. Partly because they play in larger groups, 
teachers are less likely to interrupt such rule violations. Thome and Luria suggest that 
these activities result in the solidification of distinctive male and female subcultures that 
intensify as adolescence approaches (1986, p. 55). 
</p>
<p>In extracurricular activities, Murtaugh (1988) found that boys in the United States 
were significantly more likely than girls to be involved in extracurricular activities (80% 
compared to 50%). For average academic achievers outside activities provide an impor-
tant alternative source of achievement and self-esteem (Murtaugh, 1988). This may be 
why extracurricular activities have been found by other researchers, such as McNeal (1995), 
to be related to school retention. If girls are less likely to participate in school activities, 
they are less likely to receive the benefits of such participation. 
</p>
<p>Eder and Parker (1987) examined the effect of athletic activities on the peer-group 
culture of students at a predominantly working-class middle school in the United States. 
They found that popular activities, such as male athletic contests, construct messages 
about socially sanctioned gender roles, and they note, "Since male athletic events are the 
main social events of the school, both male athletes and female cheerleaders have consid-
erable visibility and are likely to be members of the elite group.. . . Male athletes are 
encouraged to be achievement oriented and competitive, and cheerleaders are reminded 
of the importance of appearance and emotion management" (1987, p. 200). Others have 
analyzed sports as arenas for learning conceptions of masculinity and femininity (e.g., 
Bryson, 1987; Curry, 1991; Fine, 1987; Graydon, 1983; Hargreaves, 1986; Kidd, 1987; 
Kimmel, 1990; Messner, 1989,1990; Sabo &amp; Panepinto, 1990; Theberge, 1981). Through 
competitive sports, boys learn to equate masculinity with aggressiveness and they carry 
aggression into their relationships with girls through insults, sexual comments, and the </p>

</p>
<p>objectification of girls (Eder, 1997). In addition, schools generally provide a hostile envi-
ronment for gay or lesbian students who are given little official protection against harass-
ment from peers. In San Francisco and Los Angeles, for example, a disproportionate 
number of school dropouts are gay or lesbian (Dennis &amp; Harlow, 1986, cited in Grayson, 
1992). Homophobia discourages both men and women from deviating from traditional 
male and female roles out of fear of being labeled gay (Grayson, 1992). 
</p>
<p>Higher education is another arena in which gender roles are constructed, particu-
larly in informal interactions. For example, the U.S. report. Out of the Classroom: A 
Chilly Campus Climate for Women? discusses unequal participation and recognition for 
men and women in athletics and student government and notes how a "male locker room 
atmosphere" in co-ed dorms may create hostile environments for women, as may frater-
nity activities such as wet T-shirt contests (Hall &amp; Sandler, 1987). There are also prob-
lems reported of sexual harassment and assault on campuses. Martin and Hummer (1996), 
for instance, analyze the social norms and rituals of male fraternities that contribute to 
violence against women, including gang rapes, on many college campuses. 
</p>
<p>Since the 1980s awareness of sexual harassment has been elevated in the college 
environment, as a result of the establishment of policies and procedures for filing com-
plaints, as well as the development of preventative programs, conferences, and symposia 
focusing on the issue (Riggs et al., 1993). However, as Riggs, Murrell, and Cutting (1993, 
p. 1) note, the number of reported sexual harassment complaints at college and university 
campuses has increased, which may or may not be attributed to awareness programs. 
Dziech and Weiner (1984) report that 20% to'30% of undergraduate female students 
experience some form of sexual harassment from at least one professor and Boyer (1990) 
notes that more than 60% of college presidents indicated sexual harassment is a problem. 
When young women complained of acts of harassment, one study found that no action 
was taken in 45% of the cases (Stein, Marshall, &amp; Troop, 1993, cited in Bailey, 1993). 
</p>
<p>Holland and Eisenhart (1990) studied U.S. college women at a predominantly white 
and an historically black college in the South and found that for women the peer culture 
elevated the culture of romance and popularity above the value of educational attainment, 
while men could obtain status through popularity, governance activities, or sports. Ap-
plying social reproduction theory, the authors examine the active role that women play in 
constructing gender identity, frequently reinforcing mainstream roles, but sometimes re-
sisting such conceptions. Gender construction is continually occurring in formal and 
informal educational situations. Whether such construction reproduces gender inequities 
or reduces them depends on the nature of the work being done. 
</p>
<p>2.2. Classroom Interactions 
</p>
<p>Considerable gender reproduction appears to occur in the informal social relationships 
</p>
<p>occurring outside educational classrooms. What happens within formal educational set-
</p>
<p>tings? In terms of teacher attention, one frequent finding at all educational levels in the 
</p>
<p>United States is that boys receive more attention than girls (Kelly, 1988; Krupnick, 1985, 
</p>
<p>cited in Bailey; Long, Sadker, &amp; Sadker, 1986; Sadker &amp; Sadker, 1994; Swann &amp; Graddol, 
</p>
<p>1988). This attention is both positive (Hamilton, Blumfeld, Akoh, &amp; Miura, 1991) as 
</p>
<p>well as negative or disciplinary in nature (e.g., Eccles &amp; Blumenfeld, 1985). 
</p>
<p>In their observations of British youth, Hendry, Shucksmith, Love, and Glendinning 
</p>
<p>(1993) suggested that teachers perceive boys to be more rebellious and hence pay them </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Education in Global Perspective 419 
</p>
<p>more attention to avert academic failure. However, as a Scottish study (Macintosh, 1990) 
indicates, the content of the attention matters less than the fact that teachers spend more 
time with their male students. Students of both sexes perceive this extra attention as an 
indication that boys and their activities are more worthwhile. 
</p>
<p>Although many studies report more teacher attention to boys than to girls, some do 
not. Studies done in American, Japanese, and Chinese elementary schools (Lee, Ichikawa, 
&amp; Stevenson, 1987; Stevenson, Lee, &amp; Stilger, 1986) find little evidence that teachers 
communicate differently with boys and girls. Merrett and Wheldall's (1992) research in 
Britain also finds virtually no difference in teachers' use of praise and reprimand with 
elementary school boys and girls, although they do observe that both male and female 
teachers pay more attention to boys in their secondary school sample. Evidence from 
Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Malawi, Guinea, and Rwanda indicates that both male and 
female teachers believe boys are academically superior to girls (Anderson-Levitt, Bloch, 
&amp; Soumare, 1994; Brock &amp; Cammish, 1997). These mixed results highlight some of the 
problems noted by Foster, Gomm, and Hammersly (1996), such as overgeneralized anec-
dotal accounts, failure to show that examples are representative, absence of probability 
samples, lack of explicit evaluative standards, decontextualized reporting of interactions, 
and the failure to consider alternative explanations. 
</p>
<p>Differential teacher attention seems to be more common above elementary school, 
and more evident in certain subjects, such as science (Baker, 1986; Dart, &amp; Clarke, 1988; 
Jones &amp; Wheatley, 1990; Lee, Marks, &amp; Knowles, 1991). Morse and Handley (1985) 
suggest that student behavior may in part account for differential teacher attention. Dur-
ing their 2-year study, they found a striking change in the behavior of girls in science 
class from the seventh to the eighth grades. Girls became less assertive in class while 
boys became more vocal and involved in class affairs. Increased male initiation of inter-
actions swung teacher attention in their direction. Teaching teachers to give equal atten-
tion to boys and girls may be necessary if schools are to avoid contributing to gender 
inequities. 
</p>
<p>In higher education, differential treatment varies in extent, as the Association of 
American Colleges report illustrates (Hall &amp; Sandler, 1982). Examples include overt 
sexism, such as faculty making disparaging comments about women as a group, showing 
slides of women in bikinis, sexual overtures by professors toward women students, and 
more subtle forms, such as offering to help women in a way that stresses their incompe-
tence (for example, "I know women have trouble with spatial concepts, but I'll be happy 
to give you extra help."). Faculty also often encouraged female invisibility in class dis-
cussions by ignoring women and recognizing men students even when women clearly 
volunteered to participate in class, interrupting women students more than men, responding 
more extensively to men's than to women's comments, and crediting men's comments to 
their "author" but not giving authorship to women's comments (Hall &amp; Sandler, 1982, p. 
8-9). While the report raised a number of important issues, it is not always clear when its 
conclusions are based on research, anecdotal evidence, or conjecture. Subsequent research 
suggests variability in the nature, extent, and sources of bias in college classrooms (Brady 
&amp; Eisler, 1995; Constantinople, Cornelius, &amp; Gray, 1988) and has introduced additional 
variables, such as class size (Crawford &amp; MacLeod, 1990) or gender composition of the 
classroom. Brady and Eisler call for more empirical research on this subject (1995). 
</p>
<p>Although it is likely that male and female students may frequently obtain different 
treatment from their teachers in one form or another, it is less clear what the effects of 
such behavior are on the students and their learning. For example, Eccles and Blumenfeld's </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>420 Caroline Hodges Persell ET AL. 
</p>
<p>(1985) study of attitudes toward math among 275 students in fifth to ninth grades found 
that teacher's behavior mattered less than the student's self-perception of ability. 
</p>
<p>In graduate school in the social sciences, however, students are "negatively affected 
when they experience or witness unfair gender behavior in the classroom" and women 
are more negatively affected than men (Myers &amp; Dugan, 1996, p. 339). Being affected 
does not have a significant effect on student grades or participation levels, but sexist 
behaviors by professors are related to lower student perceptions of professors' expertness, 
attractiveness, and trustworthiness (Myers &amp; Dugan, 1996). 
</p>
<p>2.3. Staffing Patterns 
</p>
<p>As an institution, education is not gender neutral in its staffing patterns. In the United 
States, women comprise the vast majority of elementary teachers, a majority of secondary 
school teachers (72% of all classroom teachers are women in the United States), a minor-
ity (20%) of college and university teachers, and a very small minority of school princi-
pals (28%) and superintendents (5%) (American Association of School Administrators, 
cited in Bailey, 1993). Women are underrepresented in administrative positions, and when 
they earn them they are more likely to be in undesirable schools (either large urban or 
small rural schools) where funding and resources are problems (Tallerico, 1997). A na-
tional study of nearly 9000 U.S. teachers found that female high school teachers feel 
empowered when they have women principals but male teachers feel less powerful in 
such a situation, suggesting one reason for the persistent underrepresentation of women 
as school principals (Lee, Smith, &amp; Cioci, 1993). There are gender patterns by subject as 
well, with men more likely to teach math, science, and shop courses, women more likely 
to teach English, other languages, social studies, history, typing, and home economics 
courses. 
</p>
<p>In higher education, those women who teach in colleges and universities are more 
likely to teach in 2-year or 4-year colleges and less likely to teach in research universities. 
Moreover, 42% of women faculty are employed as part-time adjunct instructors com-
pared to 29% of men (National Education Association, 1995). In a study of all coeduca-
tional 4-year institutions offering baccalaureate degrees in 1985 in the United States, 
Tolbert and Oberfield (1991) found that women comprised 20% of the faculty overall. 
The percentage of women students in a college was positively related to the percentage of 
women faculty, but the percentage of research expenditures was not. Institutions with 
higher levels of slack resources had smaller proportions of women faculty. They theorize 
that schools with more resources have greater means to discriminate in hiring practices 
and are more able to hire more sought after, higher-priced faculty who are often male. 
Women are also considerably less likely than men to be department chairs, deans, vice 
presidents, or presidents of institutions of higher education, especially coeducational ones. 
The boards of directors of institutions of higher learning are also disproportionately com-
prised of men. 
</p>
<p>In developing nations, most teachers at all levels are men. In Mexico, women have 
gained increased access to educational careers since the 1960s, but they have not received 
equal pay and they work primarily in the lower levels of education (Cortina, 1995). As 
secondary and higher education expand, men move up to better-paid positions of greater 
prestige at secondary and higher levels. While women predominate in many teaching 
areas, the overwhelming majority of professors at the highest level in all fields are still </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Education in Global Perspective 421 
</p>
<p>men, even when the majority of their students are women (United Nations, 1995a, pp. 
94-95). 
</p>
<p>These gendered patterns of staffing in educational institutions may create and pre-
serve patterns of gender inequality in society in several ways. The presence of women 
teachers and educational leaders provides role models for women students. This has been 
frequently mentioned as one of the benefits of single-sex education (see later). Visible 
career opportunities at all levels of education motivate some young people to pursue fur-
ther learning. If men and women are unequally placed in education by level, field, pres-
tige, and pay, the message conveyed is that certain fields are gendered and thus "appro-
priate" only for members of that gender. Finally, there is growing awareness that curricula 
are not gender neutral. 
</p>
<p>2.4. Curricula 
</p>
<p>Curricula have both socializing and gatekeeping implications. This requires that we fo-
cus, as do liberal feminists, on whether men and women are studying the same subjects 
and obtaining the same knowledge, but also pay attention, as gender-focused theories do, 
to the gendered nature of curricula. 
</p>
<p>2.4.1. MATH AND SCIENCE. The answer to the liberal feminists' concerns varies, de-
pending on what aspect of the curriculum is scrutinized. For example, in the United 
States, gender differences in math course enrollments are small. The National Science 
Board of the National Science Foundation reported that from 1982 to 1987 the average 
number of math credits that male high school students received increased from 2.61 to 
3.04, while for females the average number of math credits increased from 2.46 to 2.93. 
About the same percentages of boys and girls took math courses up to calculus, which 
was taken by 7.6% of the boys but only 4.7% of the girls (AAUW, 1992, p. 26). In 1982 
and 1987, males received .12 more science credits than did females (AAUW, 1992, p. 
27). 
</p>
<p>2.4.2. TRACKING. If the focus is on tracking, however, we find that in the United States, 
high school girls are more likely to be tracked into clerical and domestic vocational courses, 
while boys are more likely to be tracked into industrial and technical courses (Gaskell, 
1985; Simpson, 1974). This sex-segregated trend has not changed in the past decade 
(Wirt, Murasicin, Goodwin, &amp; Meyer, 1989, cited in AAUW, 1992, p. 42 and Tuma &amp; 
Burns, 1996). This finding is supported by Burge and Stenstrom's (1995) comparison of 
Finnish and U.S. secondary vocational students, which found that in both countries fe-
males are more likely to enter programs in service/caring while males are more likely to 
enter production/industry-related areas of study. 
</p>
<p>2.4.3. COLLEGE MAJORS. At the tertiary level in the United States, even though more 
</p>
<p>women than men have earned college degrees since 1982, they continue to study different 
</p>
<p>subjects. However, there have been variations in this trend. From the late 1960s to the 
</p>
<p>early 1980s, the segregation of men and women in fields of study dropped precipitously. 
</p>
<p>For example, in 1964, 51.4% of women college students would have had to change ma-
</p>
<p>jors to match men's distribution, but by 1984 this figure had dropped to 31% (Jacobs, 
</p>
<p>1995, p. 81). However, the late 1980s witnessed a dramatic slowdown in the trend toward </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>422 Caroline Hodges Persell ET AL. 
</p>
<p>gender integration which Jacobs suggests is explained by a decline in support for new 
opportunities for women and the absence of societal support for men entering predomi-
nantly female fields. To the degree that college major is related to occupational place-
ment, significant gender differences in what is studied may affect the availability of par-
ticular careers. For example, in computer science, only 4% of full professors are women 
(Feigenbaum, Hargittai, &amp; O'Rourke, 1994). 
</p>
<p>2.4.4. TEXTBOOKS AND READERS. Early research by U.S. social scientists documented 
the unequal representation and treatment of girls and women in reading textbooks (Frasher 
&amp; Walker, 1972; Women on Words and Images, 1972), elementary school textbooks 
(Weitzman &amp; Rizzo, 1976), high school history textbooks (Treckler, 1973), and testing 
(Saario, Jacklin, &amp; Tittle, 1973). The assumption underlying such research is that the 
language and images of a dominant group can affect the self-images and belief systems of 
members of another group, and that equitable language and imagery can contribute to 
gender equity (O'Rourke, 1995). 
</p>
<p>There is recent evidence that the frequency of depicting males and females has be-
come more evenly distributed in children's picture books. However, girls continue to be 
shown as passive and dependent as was the case earlier (Kortenhaus &amp; Demarest, 1993). 
Gonzalez-Suarez and Ekstrom (1989) found in their content analysis of seven representa-
tive elementary school textbooks that males represent 64% of the text examples and 61% 
of the illustrations. Males were likely to be presented in occupational roles or as historical 
figures whereas females were shown in ways that emphasized their personality character-
istics. They did, however, indicate that when compared with a study done a decade be-
fore, they found some evidence of efforts to reduce sex bias. 
</p>
<p>Several international studies of gender bias in textbooks in the Caribbean and Brit-
ain (Whiteley, 1996), Australia (Connell, 1989), and Singapore (Sunderland, 1992) have 
found imbalances in the representation of women in physics texts, general textbooks, and 
English texts, suggesting that unequal gender representation is not confined to the United 
States. In his study on Kenya, Obura (1991) points out that in book-scarce nations text-
books are crucial in shaping self perception. The fact that women are largely absent in 
textbooks, even in agricultural countries where they contribute most of the productive 
labor, is extremely telling. 
</p>
<p>In college-level sex-education textbooks, sexual dimorphism and heterosexuality are 
assumed to be normal, and women's sexuality is defined in terms of male pleasure 
(Myerson, 1992). 
</p>
<p>2.4.5. COMPUTER USAGE. In the United States, numerous studies have documented 
</p>
<p>that girls gain less access than boys to personal computers in school (e.g., Collis, 1985; 
</p>
<p>Lockheed, 1985; Miura &amp; Hess, 1983; Sanders &amp; Stone, 1986), even at eUte preparatory 
</p>
<p>schools (Persell &amp; Cookson, 1987). Similar results were reported in Australia (Kinnear, 
</p>
<p>1995). In many schools, the computer room is perceived as boys' space, and girls feel 
</p>
<p>they don't belong. "But when parents and teachers make special efforts to involve female 
</p>
<p>students, they find converts. 'Subtlety does not work,' says Jo Sanders, coauthor of The 
</p>
<p>Neuter Computer. 'You have to transmit the message loud and clear that girls and com-
</p>
<p>puters belong together.'" (cited in Sadker &amp; Sadker, 1994, p. 123). 
</p>
<p>Several studies have begun to document ways of achieving greater gender'equity in 
</p>
<p>computer usage. For example, Linn (1985) and Lockheed and Frakt (1984) suggest that 
</p>
<p>when girls have more opportunities to use computers, their attitudes toward using them </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Education in Global Perspective 423 
</p>
<p>improve and their usage increases (Fish, Gross, &amp; Sanders, 1986). Kramer and Lehman 
(1990) stress the importance of taking into consideration the variety of contexts and con-
tents of computing, as well as the cultural norms and values that surround it. 
</p>
<p>Given the extensive incorporation of computers into many workplaces and the fact 
that one of the fastest growing areas of well-paid jobs lies in the broad field of computers, 
the incomplete inclusion of girls in this field has potentially significant negative conse-
quences for their futures. It may also affect the majors they select in college. The two most 
evident challenges to existing educational practices appear in the curricular development 
of Women's Studies programs and in single-sex schooling, although neither are mono-
lithic with respect to where they stand on the issue of equal access to "mainstream" 
knowledge compared to the creation and transmission of alternative knowledges. 
</p>
<p>2.5. Women's Studies Programs 
</p>
<p>The first Women's Studies program was approved in 1970 at San Diego State University. 
Today, more than 621 Women's Studies programs and departments exist throughout the 
country and more than 1 million students annually take more than 30,000 Women's Stud-
ies courses (Antler, 1995; Chamberlain, 1988; Musil, 1992). In 1990 the National Women's 
Studies Association (NWSA) reported there were 102 graduate level programs (Musil, 
1992, p. 2). 
</p>
<p>Women's Studies programs affect the individuals involved, the school environment, 
and the larger society. Curricula outside the Women's Studies offerings on campuses have 
been influenced by the interdisciplinary nature of Women's Studies. Women's Studies 
draws on the faculty and resources of other departments and is thereby integrated into 
other, more traditional departments, such as sociology, biology, economics, history, and 
English. While this may lead to tensions, such as faculty having primary allegiances to 
more powerful, established departments (Butler &amp; Schmitz, 1992) or Women's Studies 
programs not having the prestige of a full-fledged department, the Women's Studies in-
terdisciplinary approach has been able to influence the curricular offerings throughout 
colleges. Other attempts to transform curricula include mainstreaming, that is, "efforts to 
integrate the subject of women and the substance of Women's Studies into curriculum" 
(Stimpson &amp; Cobb, 1986). 
</p>
<p>Students within these classes are touched as well. After conducting in-depth case 
studies of seven Women's Studies programs, Musil (1992) concluded that most notably 
the female students of these programs often found self-empowerment and their own voice. 
According to Musil, Women's Studies classes are more inclusive and participatory. Women 
who felt stifled and invisible in male-dominated class discussions find a place where they 
can express their thoughts concerning course material that is deeply connected to their 
own lives. Through finding their own voice students feel empowered not only personally, 
but this empowerment translates into social responsibility. Luebke and Reilly's somewhat 
broader study (1995) of 89 graduates from 43 programs across the United States notes 
outcomes similar to Musil's. They found that graduates who majored inWomen's Studies 
report feelings of "being empowered; developing self-confidence; learning to think criti-
cally; understanding differences; discovering the intersections among . . . [various] forms 
of oppression; and experiencing community" (1995, p. 199). 
</p>
<p>Women's Studies flourished in a time of political activism. Although critics of such 
programs charge they are too political, advocates see examining the experiences of women </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>424 Caroline Hodges Persell ET AL. 
</p>
<p>as no less political than excluding the voices of diverse groups. The increased social 
responsibility and empowerment of students, as described by Musil (1992), and the dedi-
cation of politically minded faculty offer a picture of women's scholarship as closely and 
actively linked to social change. Stimpson and Cobb, however, caution that the influence 
of Women's Studies may impact academic scholarship more than its institutional setting, 
"Scholars outside women's studies are far more likely to include an article on the history 
of child care in their research than to support a child-care center at their colleges. A 
professional association would rather endorse women's studies than affirmative action or 
paid parental leave" (1986, p. 18). 
</p>
<p>Women's Studies programs and classes exist throughout the world, in both indus-
trial and developing nations, including Sweden, Australia, Canada, Bangladesh, Japan, 
Mexico, and Brazil (Chamberlain, 1988; Kelly, 1989; Stimpson &amp; Cobb, 1986), although 
the degree of institutionalization varies widely (Jacobs, 1996; Kelly, 1989). Just as Musil 
(1992) concludes that U.S. programs reflect their unique environments. Women's Studies 
programs internationally reflect their particular social and political contexts (Stimpson 
&amp; Cobb, 1986). For example, developing countries may have more need to be concerned 
with literacy issues than do developed nations. Women's Studies programs internation-
ally sometimes suffer from censorship, limited funding opportunities, politics that divide 
potential women allies, and criticisms that they are a Western fad (Stimpson &amp; Cobb, 
1986). Women's Studies programs in other countries tend to be peripheral to mainstream 
higher education, with programs located in special training programs or within research 
institutes (Fiol-Matta &amp; Chamberlain, 1994). 
</p>
<p>2.6. Single-Sex versus Coeducational Schools 
</p>
<p>In U.S. higher education, the relative benefits of single-sex versus coeducational colleges 
have been much discussed. Originally founded because women were denied admission to 
most institutions of higher education, there remained about 300 women-only colleges in 
the United States as recently as the 1960s. By 1992, the figure had dropped, however, to 
about 71 four-year colleges and 13 junior colleges, or about 6.5% of all U.S. colleges and 
universities (Kim &amp; Alverez, 1995; Riordan, 1994). In an extensive literature review, 
Canada and Pringle (1995) suggest that compared to women who attend mixed-sex col-
leges, women who attend women's colleges have greater self-esteem at graduation (Astin, 
1977; Miller-Bernal, 1993; Riordan, 1990; Smith, 1990), have career aspirations that are 
less gender stereotypical (Bressler &amp; Wendell, 1980; Carnegie Commission, 1973), be-
come more engaged in college activities (Miller-Bernal, 1993; Smith, 1990), are more 
likely to enter traditionally male professions such as medicine and the natural sciences 
(Tidball, 1985, 1986; Tidball &amp; Kistiakowsky, 1976), are likely to earn higher salaries 
(Conaty, Alsalam, James, &amp; To, 1989; Riordan, 1994), and likely to reach higher levels 
of career achievement (Gates &amp; Williamson, 1978; Rice &amp; Hemmings, 1988; Tidball, 
1973, p. 1980). In addition. Smith (1990) reported that students in women's colleges 
evaluated their academic programs as stronger than did their mixed-sex college counter-
parts; Rice and Hemmings (1988) found that women in women's colleges have lower 
dropout rates than women in mixed-sex colleges; and Ledman, Miller, and Brown (1995) 
suggest that graduate education may be a factor intervening in the career success of women's 
college graduates. 
</p>
<p>Internationally, the effects of single-sex education appear to vary. In England, one </p>

<p>Gender and Education in Global Perspective 425 
</p>
<p>team of researchers found evidence for less gender stereotyping of school subjects in 
single sex schools among pupils aged 11 to 12, but not among older students (CoUey, 
Comber, &amp; Hargreaves, 1994). In Australia, private single-sex schools were better for 
girls' achievement (Jones, 1990), although no advantages for participation or attainment 
in science were found in single-sex schools in Northern Ireland (Daly, 1995). In Kenya, 
girls in an all-girls school found it easier to use scarce science resources, such as micro-
scopes and lab equipment, than did girls in coeducational schools who deferred to the 
boys (Ndunda &amp; Munby, 1991), although social class may have been a confounding fac-
tor there. In Islamic countries single-sex education is prescribed by religion and custom 
(purdah) and seems designed to keep women in their proper roles in society (Abul-Husn, 
1995; El-Sanabary, 1994; King &amp; Al-Musalam, 1989). 
</p>
<p>The problem with much of the research in the United States is that the women who 
attend single-sex and mixed-sex colleges are not comparable in terms of their social 
backgrounds and possibly other factors as well. Studies that try to control statistically for 
preexisting differences have reported more mixed results or the absence of positive effects 
for single-sex education (e.g., Lee &amp; Bryk, 1986, 1989; Marsh, 1989a, b; Marsh, Owens, 
Meyers, &amp; Smith, 1989; Riordan, 1992, 1994; Stoecker &amp; Pascarella, 1991). As a result, 
some authors remain skeptical about various alleged advantages (e.g., Giele, 1987; Kim 
&amp; Alverez, 1995; Oates &amp; Williamson, 1981). 
</p>
<p>Several studies use national samples with extensive statistical controls on back-
ground characteristics (e.g., Kim &amp; Alvarez, 1995; Riordan, 1990, 1994; Stoecker &amp; 
Pascarella, 1991). Stoecker and Pascarella (1991) found that after controUing for stu-
dents' background characteristics, institutional selectivity, achievement in college, and 
subsequent educational attainment, attending women-only colleges had only a trivial net 
impact on graduates' early career earnings. Riordan (1994) used the National Longitudi-
nal Study of the High School Class of 1972 and found that women's college attendance 
was not related to educational attainment but was related to occupational attainment and 
indirectly related to personal income via occupation, when controlling for parental socio-
economic status, SAT scores, marital status, work hours, geographic region, and years 
attending a women's college (Riordan, 1994). He explains these results by theorizing that 
women-only colleges provide more social capital for women students, meaning that they 
provide more encouragement, attention, security, comfort, trust, and sense of identity, 
although this interpretation needs to be tested empirically in future research. In a similar 
vein, the greater social and academic integration of students within their institutions has 
been used to explain the higher rates of college persistence in women's and historically 
black colleges (Baker &amp; Velez, 1996). These conclusions are consistent with Tidball's 
finding (1989) that the critical mass of role models, valuation of women, and unparal-
leled opportunities for women contribute to all-women's colleges' ability to confer ad-
vantages on their students. 
</p>
<p>Canada and Pringle (1995) caution that it is difficult to assess, once and for all, 
which is better: single-sex or mixed-sex education because such comparisons inevitably 
rely on central tendencies, which not only obscure variability within categories but over-
look the possibilities for change. Thus, single-sex schools may sometimes be as sexist, or 
even more so, as mixed-sex schools, as Lee, Marks, and Byrd (1994) found, perhaps 
because many variables besides sex composition affect the kinds and frequency of sexism 
in classrooms, including the gender mix and the institution's policy stance. They studied 
all-girls, all-boys, and coed private secondary schools and found forms of sexism in all 
three types, although both the form and severity varied. "The most problematic forms of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>426 Caroline Hodges Persell ET AL. 
</p>
<p>sexism in single-sex environments&mdash;explicit sexuality in boys' schools and encourage-
ment of dependence in girls' schools&mdash;were rarer in mixed-sex classrooms. Sexism in 
coeducational schools commonly took the form of either gender domination or active 
discrimination and was most common in one curricular area (chemistry)" (Lee et al., 
1994, p. 114). Three factors were strongly related to sexism: subject matter (chemistry), 
balanced numbers (compounded with chemistry), and school policies. 
</p>
<p>Given evidence that sexism ocurs in both mixed-sex and single-sex schools, many 
educational researchers seeking ways to ensure gender equity have turned their attention 
to policies. Lee et al. argue that "...sexism in the classroom is not inevitable. In fact, 
schools and classrooms are exactly the locations from which change should spring. Aware 
of continuing societal sexism, the school community should recognize its responsibility 
to set a proactive tone on gender issues" (Lee et al., 1994, pp. 115-116). School policy 
can foster positive engenderment, that is, consciously strive "to provide equitable educa-
tion for both sexes, including attempts to counter sexism and its residual effects" (Lee et 
al., 1994, p. 98). 
</p>
<p>2.7. Achievement 
</p>
<p>In the United States, girls get somewhat higher grades than boys throughout their school 
careers and national test score differences between boys and girls have been shrinking in 
recent years. A national study of eighth-grade U.S. students showed females did not lag 
their male classmates in science achievement tests, grades, and course enrollments, al-
though they had less positive attitudes toward science, participated in fewer relevant 
extracurricular activities, and aspired less often to science careers than did males 
(Catsambis, 1995). 
</p>
<p>International data on gender and educational achievement reveal mixed results. 
Among students in grades 8 and 9 in Botswana, math achievement scores were roughly 
equal, and girls scored higher than boys in literacy and reading skills (Fuller, Hua, &amp; 
Snyder, 1994). In France, among students ages 11 to 12, girls surpass boys in school 
achievement (Felouzis, 1993). However, in Nigeria (Badejo, 1990), Bangladesh (Mohsin, 
Nath, &amp; Chowdhury, 1996), Pakistan (Warwick &amp; Jatoi, 1994), and Malawi (Davison &amp; 
Kanyuka, 1992) boys achieve at higher levels than girls, because of active sex discrimina-
tion in Nigeria and lower educational expectations for females in Malawi. In Pakistan, 
many students live in rural areas, but rural areas are inhospitable to good female teachers. 
Female students, especially, do better in math when taught by female teachers with uni-
versity degrees. Therefore, the gender gap in math achievement appears to be due to the 
interaction of teacher gender and rural education (Warwick &amp; Jatoi, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Using comparative international data on 19 countries concerning gender differ-
ences in math achievement. Baker and Jones (1993) found that girls perform better in 
math than boys in some countries (French-speaking Belgium, Finland, Hungary, and 
Thailand), the same in some countries (British Columbia, England-Wales, Hong Kong, 
Japan, Nigeria, Scotland, Sweden, and the United States), and not as well in others (France, 
Israel, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Ontario, Canada, and Swaziland). Overall 
gender differences in math achievement appear to be decreasing over time. Gender differ-
ences in achievement appear to be related to differences in women's labor market oppor-
tunities in various countries, since where females have more access to advanced training 
and to the workplace, sex differences in mathematical performance decrease (Baker &amp; </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Education in Global Perspective 427 
</p>
<p>Jones, 1993, p. 96). In countries where opportunities are less gender stratified, boys and 
girls are more likely to study the same mathematics curricula and parents are more likely 
to encourage them equally to learn mathematics (Baker &amp; Jones, 1993, p. 99). 
</p>
<p>2.8. Summary 
</p>
<p>Liberal feminist concerns highlight gender inequities in educational experiences, while 
gender-focused and especially gender-difference perspectives offer a fundamental cri-
tique of "schools, curricula, pedagogical styles, academic disciplines, methodological 
conventions, and predominant theoretical frames as constructed more in accordance with 
men's than women's ways of knowing, with the result that women are disadvantaged 
both as learners and as producers of knowledge" (Grant et al., 1994, p. 93). Gender-
difference theorists are concerned less with seeing that women achieve equal treatment 
and exposure within existing structures and more with constructing alternative educa-
tional structures that respect and foster women's presumably unique ways of knowing. 
Patricia Hill Collins and Dorothy Smith "believe that all sociological theory is written 
from a 'standpoint' " which affects what one studies, the methods used, and the interpre-
tations one makes, suggest Grant et al. (1994, pp. 88-89). Hence the question of whose 
knowledge is being developed, recognized, taught, established, and whose voices are 
being heard requires consideration. 
</p>
<p>Within educational institutions there is evidence that informal social relations some-
times reproduce gendered identities and inequalities. At the same time, there is trend 
evidence suggesting that the formal curricula of schools is moving toward challenging 
and changing traditional gender identities and inequities, although counterexamples con-
tinue to exist. There is evidence for decreasing gender differences in educational achieve-
ment in the United States and other countries. There are also numerous examples of 
curricula and programs that are challenging the content and processes of conventional 
education, in Women's Studies programs and all-women's schools and colleges. These 
suggest some of the complex ways that education may operate to reproduce but also to 
challenge existing gender stratification. Whether the emphasis on the distinctiveness of 
feminine experience and knowledge will reinforce dimorphism and gender distinctions 
in society and thereby increase the chances that invidious gender distinctions will persist 
is an interesting potential paradox to consider. 
</p>
<p>Mary WoUstoncraft (1759-1799) argued in the eighteenth century for educational 
parity between men and women so that both genders could develop their full human 
potential. However, as Tong (1989, p. 17) notes, "unless society also provides the equally 
educated woman with the same civil liberties and economic opportunities a man has, she 
will be able to exercise her hard won autonomy only within the private, or domestic, 
realm." Thus it becomes essential to consider not only issues of access to education and 
equity within education, but also the question of whether men and women enjoy the same 
consequences of education. 
</p>
<p>3. INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF EDUCATION

<p>The major theoretical perspectives tend to focus on different consequences of education 
</p>
<p>and offer varied explanations for those different outcomes. Not surprisingly, liberal femi-</p>

</p>
<p>nists tend to stress the occupational and income effects of education, to see if education 
pays off equally for individual men and women, while gender-focused perspectives may 
consider how education affects health, fertility, economic development, and social atti-
tudes. When faced with the unequal benefits of education for women compared to men, 
liberal feminists tend to hope that antidiscriminatory policies by the state will level the 
playing field. Gender-focused theorists help to highlight other formal and informal struc-
tural conditions necessary for relatively equal benefits to occur. In this section we con-
sider briefly the effects of education on health and fertility, economic development, politi-
cal participation and social attitudes, and occupational status and income. 
</p>
<p>3.1. Health and Fertility 
</p>
<p>In the United States, higher levels of education are related to greater knowledge of nutri-
tion and health (Hyman, Wright, &amp; Reed, 1975), to better health for both men and women 
(Ross &amp; Wu, 1995), and to increasing life expectancy for both men and women (Elo &amp; 
Preston, 1996), although educational differentials in mortality appear to have narrowed 
for white women since 1960 (Preston and Elo, 1995). Major cross-national research on 
26 developing countries shows conclusively that more educated women have consider-
ably lower fertility rates than uneducated women in all the societies studied (Martin, 
1995, p. 189). For example, in North Africa more educated women have between two and 
three fewer children on average than less educated women, and the negative effect of 
education on fertility is relatively linear. Education is also related to age at marriage in all 
26 countries, to women's family-size preferences, and to contraceptive use, especially 
modern forms of contraception (Martin, 1995, pp. 193-195). Others find that more edu-
cated women are more likely to use contraceptives effectively (Rosenzweig, 1996), and to 
have lower rates of discontinuation and failure, at least in the United States (Grady, Hirsch, 
Keen, &amp; Vaughn, 1981). In Egypt, ElSaadawi (1980, cited in Taylor et al., 1985) found 
that more educated families were somewhat less likely than less educated families to 
practice some form of female genital mutilation (66% compared to 98% of uneducated 
families), a practice that may cause extreme pain, infection, and sometimes death. The 
education of the families was not, however, related to the girls' lack of knowledge about 
the physical, psychological, and sexual effects of the procedure. The girls interviewed by 
El Saadawi were equally ignorant often not knowing what had been done to them, re-
gardless of their own educational level or that of their families. 
</p>
<p>3.2. Economic Development 
</p>
<p>Cross-national data on 96 countries from 1960 to 1985 "found clear evidence that in less-
</p>
<p>developed countries, especially some of the poorest, educational expansion among school-
</p>
<p>age girls at the primary level has a stronger effect on long-term economic prosperity than 
</p>
<p>does educational expansion among school-age boys" (Benavot, 1989, p. 25). Moreover, 
</p>
<p>the primary education of females has a strong effect on economic growth, "even after the 
</p>
<p>rates of fertility and participation in the labor force are controlled" (Benavot, 1989, p. 
</p>
<p>41). Secondary and tertiary education of both males and females has a relatively weak 
</p>
<p>impact on economic growth in less developed countries, perhaps because the graduates 
</p>
<p>work in management positions for foreign enterprises or in the public sector and because </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Education in Global Perspective 429 
</p>
<p>they may be more oriented to the centers of world cuhure and may even emigrate there 
(Benavot, 1989, p. 42). In heavily agricultural countries, literate farmers obtain higher 
crop yields than do illiterate farmers (Lockheed, Jamison, &amp; Lau, 1980; Rosenzweig, 
1996, pp. 27, 28), another way education contributes to productivity. 
</p>
<p>Because the education of women contributes significantly to the economic develop-
ment of developing countries, major world agencies, such as the United Nations and the 
World Bank, strongly support educational equity for females. However, such support is 
not universally applauded in all societies. There has been resistance to the goal of gender 
equity in education, especially in heavily Islamic nations. For example, in Afganistan, 
the fundamentalist Taliban has at least temporarily barred most women from working 
outside the home or going to school (Crossette, 1996). The Secretary General of the 
United Nations warned the new Islamic rulers that the United Nations objects to the 
extreme discrimination they practice against women and warned of "serious repercus-
sions" for the foreign aid program there (Crossette, 1996, p. Al). The results of such 
conflict between international cultural norms and local Islamic mores is yet to be seen. 
</p>
<p>3.3. Political Participation and Social Attitudes 
</p>
<p>Educational attainment is related to the act of voting in the United States (Hyman, Wright, 
&amp; Reed, 1975; Persell, Green, Gurevich, &amp; Seidel, 1997). Even as early as the 1960s, 
education increased the politization of U.S. women (Lansing, 1972). The education of 
women in the United States may be related to the growing gender gap in voting, with 
educated women more likely to vote Democratic than similarly educated men, although 
ideology may be an intervening factor (Gotsch &amp; Campbell, 1987). Education is related 
to greater political participation among men and women in Norway (Petterson &amp; Rose, 
1996), the Netherlands (Smeenk, 1994), and Greece (Dobratz, 1992). In the United States, 
post-secondary education enhances participation in political activities of all kinds (vot-
ing, political discussions, campaign activity), community activities (volunteer work, so-
cial action, and neighborhood groups, youth organizations, church-related activities), 
and espousal of civic life goals (working for social justice, being a leader in the commu-
nity) (Lindsay, Knox, &amp; Kolb, 1991). Moreover, in the United States educated women 
were at the forefront of both waves of the feminist movement (Ferree &amp; Hess, 1985) and 
colleges and universities continue to be fertile sites for the development of feminist activ-
ism (Tyack &amp; Hansot, 1992). 
</p>
<p>However, Stromquist (1997) found that other factors interfered with the emancipatory 
potential of education. In her study of women's participation in a literacy program in 
Brazil, she found that length of previous schooling, family support for literacy, distance 
to class, domestic work, responsibility for children, health problems, and poverty all af-
fected the capacity of education to increase political participation and change women's 
daily lives. Thus the material conditions of women's lives seem to interact with education 
and affect its outcomes. 
</p>
<p>At least in the United States, higher levels of education are related to more egalitar-
ian attitudes toward gender roles and to greater espoused racial and gay tolerance (Persell 
et al., 1997). Among Muslim men in India, however, more educated men are no more likely 
than less educated men to favor advancing women's status, in education, employment, poli-
tics, or the family (Indukumari, 1978). In Matlab, Bangladesh, a poor, traditional society 
with low status for women, schooling alone is not enough to motivate women to abandon </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>430 Caroline Hodges Persell ET AL. 
</p>
<p>their strong preference for sons (Chowdhury, 1994). These resuhs suggest that the effects 
of education are contingent upon cultural factors as well as upon material conditions. 
</p>
<p>3.4. Occupational Advancement and Earnings 
</p>
<p>In developed countries, women are entering the labor market in increasing numbers. As 
more occupations professionalize, they require ever more advanced educational creden-
tials, at least in societies in which some significant proportion of the population works in 
occupations other than agriculture (Collins,1979; Ishida, MuUer, &amp; Ridge, 1995). World-
wide, higher levels of educational attainment are related to the performance of higher 
status occupations (Treiman, 1977). In Japan, however, more educated women are more 
likely to leave the labor force when they marry than are less educated women (Hirao, 
1996), a pattern that was more prevalent in the United States in the 1950s than it is today. 
</p>
<p>To obtain occupational equity it is necessary for women to enter the full range of 
male occupations, which they have not yet done (Reskin &amp; Roos, 1992). "To do this, we 
need sex equity in educational institutions and job training programs to ensure that women 
are well represented in the labor queues for nontraditional jobs" (Reskin &amp; Roos, 1992, p. 
318). The process is somewhat circular, since women are less likely to major in fields, 
such as engineering, where women are greatly underrepresented which in turn makes 
them less likely to enter such fields. Occupational gender stratification was noted in the 
25 industrial countries studied by Charles (1992), although the extent varied by size of 
the service sector, fertility rates, gender ideologies, and forms of political decision-mak-
ing. Bradley (1997) reflects on how educational structures may be linked to occupational 
gender stratification cross-nationally. Reskin and Roos point out that even when women 
enter historically male fields, including high-status professional occupations, they are 
likely to be ghettoized within those fields into a few specialties which are often lower paid 
(Reskin &amp; Roos, 1992, p. 318). Thus women and men still do not receive equal occupa-
tional outcomes from their education even in the United States. Within certain sectors, how-
ever, such as the U.S. federal civil service, gender integration of occupations proceeded more 
rapidly and steadily from 1976 to 1992 than in the general economy (Lewis, 1996). 
</p>
<p>For individual women in the United States, employed women with more education 
earn more than those with less education, even though they do not, on average, earn as 
much as men with comparable educational backgrounds (Reskin &amp; Padavic, 1994). The 
gender gap in wages at first job is bigger among those with only a high school education 
(20%) than for those with more education (13%) (Marini &amp; Fan, 1996). In Turkey, edu-
cational level is related to both participation in the labor force and returns to education, 
but the returns to women are somewhat smaller compared to those for men (Tansel, 1994). 
In Brazil, education had a powerful effect on income for both men and women, even 
though men earned more than women on average (Haller &amp; Saraiva, 1992). Reporting on 
returns to education in 78 nations, Psacharopoulos (1994) notes that at the societal level, 
the highest rates of return to education accrue to investments in the secondary schooling 
of females. 
</p>
<p>3.5. Summary 
</p>
<p>The various effects of education on gender equity interact with economic, political, and 
</p>
<p>cultural conditions, and the nature of that interaction shapes how education can affect </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Education in Global Perspective 431 
</p>
<p>gender equity. Education has various kinds of value, including use value, exchange value, 
social value, and symbolic value. Its use value includes the value of literacy and numeracy 
for gaining some measure of knowledge and control over many environments, the stimu-
lation of cognitive development, the gains in actual knowledge obtained, competence in 
gaining further information about an issue, reasoning ability, rational planning, and in-
creasing awareness of alternative possibilities. Exposure to new ideas and lifestyles may 
increase a person's tendency to question traditional norms and practices. Schools also 
serve as important agents of socialization, shaping attitudes, opinions, and values. The 
use value of education may have been what prompted the nineteenth century Scotch-
American feminist, Frances Wright, to advocate the educational emancipation of women 
in the broadest sense of the word. She believed that uneducated women were at the mercy 
of all who would prey on their ignorance and credulity (Curti, 1935/1968, p. 180). To some 
degree, the use value of education for women operates independendy of their social, political, 
and economic power in society, although it may be limited in scope. For individuals and 
societies, education can enhance economic productivity, health, fertility, life expectancy, 
as well as their children's health, life expectancy, and educational success (Adetunji, 
1995; Chowdhury, 1994; Hill &amp; King, 1995; Kalmijn, 1994; Mwamwenda, 1994). 
</p>
<p>The exchange value of education in an economic market depends on the existence of 
labor market opportunities for women (Carnoy &amp; Gong, 1996; King, 1996). Similarly, 
education cannot provide political gains for women in the absence of opportunities for 
political participation. Moreover, education is unlikely to alter gender and power rela-
tions in a society if education is structured so as to reproduce gender divisions and in-
equalities, for example as El-Sanabary (1994) suggests is the case in Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p>The social value of education includes the forging of networks of relationships with 
others who have knowledge, who control key resources, and with whom one can produc-
tively interact as a relative social equal. Thus, for individuals education may provide 
important mentors and role models for women seeking entrance into graduate school and 
certain occupations and for a society education contains the potential for transnational 
communication. 
</p>
<p>Finally, education has symbolic value in that higher levels of education are assumed 
to confer certain cultural and social status. As such, education is a resource for individual 
women that may offset the expectations for superior performance by males in goal-ori-
ented groups (Webster, 1996). Countries seeking respect in the wider world increasingly 
see the importance of education for their citizens, both male and female. 
</p>
<p>4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
</p>
<p>Gender equity in access to education is not yet fully achieved worldwide, nor is equal 
treatment fully available in schools. There is, however, evidence for progress toward 
greater gender equity in access and experience, as well as a continuing need to push for 
full equality. Governments can be antithetical to gender equity, as in Afghanistan and 
Saudi Arabia, or supportive, as in countries where the state mandates and pays for equal 
education for males and females. The presence of transnational organizations, such as 
the United Nations and World Bank, which challenge blatently sexist practices and have 
resources they can threaten to withhold may provide some support for gender equity, at 
least with respect to educational access. The strong presence of national and transnational 
commitments to gender equity may help women in negotiating with educational institu-</p>

<p>tions, as liberal feminists suggest. However, when there are state-sanctioned differences 
in the education provided to men and women, education is more likely to contribute to the 
reproduction of gender inequalities in society, as critical feminists suggest. 
</p>
<p>Even when there is equal access, educational institutions can be sexist, neutral, or 
proactive in fostering gender equity. Education is an important arena within which dis-
tinctively gendered identities are constructed. As such, as long as gender is a salient 
distinction in society, education contributes to the potential for inequities based on that 
distinction. Within the institution of education. Women's Studies programs, gay and les-
bian studies programs, and all-women's colleges may challenge existing structures, prac-
tices, and knowledge by providing an independent power base and support for the devel-
opment of new knowledge. Paradoxically, such programs also risk intellectual ghettoization 
and intensified dimorphism. Coeducational as well as single-sex schools can sustain posi-
tive engenderment policies. In these and other ways, education may provide pressure 
points for change. Paradoxically, education can also reproduce gendered identities and 
inequalities, for example in informal social relations within schools or in Saudi Arabia 
today. Informal peer cultures emerge as a central site for constructing the gendered iden-
tities and ideologies of the larger society. While sometimes constrained by the gender 
equity ideologies of a school, such identities and beliefs may survive underground or on 
the fringes of official school culture. 
</p>
<p>Even the development of separate but unequal educational systems, while clearly not 
preferable, may provide a pressure point for future change. This was certainly the case 
historically in the United States. Single-sex schools appear to promote gender equity 
under some conditions while undermining it in others. 
</p>
<p>The benefits of education, while not fully available to women compared to men, are 
becoming increasingly accessible. Education can empower individual women by improv-
ing their health, fertility control, and life expectancy, and in the public sphere of politics 
and economics. These gains for individual women also benefit their societies, perhaps 
making it harder for individual men to oppose the education of women. Some of education's 
benefits for individual women depend upon economic options, legal rights, and political 
opportunities within a society. The exchange value of education is contingent upon the 
level of economic and technical development in a society that influences the degree to 
which occupations and positions rely upon educational credentials rather than character-
istics of an individual's family background, land ownership, gender, race, religion, and 
so forth. Education appears to encourage people to be more involved politically in many 
countries, although such effects seem contingent upon other conditions as well. Educa-
tion appears to be liberating for women when it takes a proactive stance toward gender 
equity and when it operates in a society that provides economic, political, legal, and 
social opportunities for women. Even within substantially inequitable societies, however, 
education can begin to provide some personal and societal benefits, such as gains in 
fertility control, health, and economic development. It may also provide resources for 
women as they seek to push for greater gender equity in the political and economic realms. 
In short, in various ways education can empower women even while it may also construct 
gender inequalities.

<p>CHAPTER 20 
</p>
<p>Gender, Hierarchy, and Science 
</p>
<p>MARY FRANK FOX 
</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>In the study of gender and society, science is a strategic analytical research site&mdash;because 
of the hierarchical character of gendered relations, generally, and of science, particularly. 
Gendered relations are hierarchical inasmuch as women and men are not simply social 
groups neutrally distinguished from each other, but rather, are differentially ranked and 
evaluated according to a standard of masculine norms and behavior. Science, in turn, is 
fundamentally hierarchical. It is an institutional medium of power, marked by immense 
inequality in status and rewards, with the valued attributes of science being those more 
ascribed to men compared to women. 
</p>
<p>In the classifications of the National Research Council and National Science Foun-
dation, the eight science fields are physical, mathematical, computer, environmental, life 
sciences, and engineering, as well as psychology and social sciences. In this chapter, 
science refers primarily to these fields, excluding psychology and social sciences&mdash;except 
in the national data or specific samples on career-attainments, where data are both aggre-
gated across and disaggregated by the eight fields and are specified as such. 
</p>
<p>My aims are to analyze the hierarchical gendered relations&mdash;or stratification by gen-
der&mdash;operating in: (1) attainments within and constraints upon participation, performance, 
and rewards in scientific careers; and (2) arguments about the construction of scientific 
knowledge. We shall see that science both exemplifies and expands gender stratification 
within society.

</p>
<p>1.1. Science as a Focal Case 
</p>
<p>What warrants the focus upon science? In the sociology of gender, science is a focal case 
because science is an agent of power, with consequences for the present and future human 
condition (see also Cockburn, 1985; Wajcman, 1991). Grounded in abstract and system-
atic theory and rationality, science is a prototype of professional claim to "authoritative 
knowledge" (Fox &amp; Braxton, 1994, p. 374). Science defines what is "taken for granted" 
in daily lives and activities by literally billions of people (Cozzens &amp; Woodhouse, 1995, 
p. 551). To be in control of science is to be involved in directing the future, and this is 
highly valued (Wajcman, 1991, p. 144). Tellingly, other occupations (from law to 
librarianship) have tried to mimic scientific authority and practice in their strategies for 
professional dominance and control (Derber, Schwartz, &amp; Magress, 1990, p. 33). 
</p>
<p>1.1.1. SCIENCE, POWER, AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AS a agent of power, science re-
flects and connects with central social institutions, especially education and the state. 
Mathematics and its integral relationship to science operate as critical filter subjects in 
progression through educational levels. In higher education, science has been central to 
the development of the modern, complex university. Further, science and the political 
order sustain each other&mdash;with the "scientific ethos" of merit and equity operating as part 
of the belief system that underlies public support of science. The institutional connections 
between science, education, and the state, and the belief systems underlying them, point 
to the importance of science as an agent of power, and as a critical case in the study of 
gender and society. In understanding the relationship between gender and science, we 
need to apprehend the connections between science, power, and social institutions, ad-
dressed in the following sections. 
</p>
<p>1.1.1.1. Science and Education. When the church controlled education, Latin was the 
"filter," the foundational subject that needed to be mastered, and that operated as a sieve 
in successive filtering of students through educational levels. By the eighteenth century, 
the church had lost its dominance over education. The rising bourgeoisie gained influ-
ence, and Latin began to give way, initially to philosophy and logic, and then to science 
and mathematics as prominent subjects. Science and mathematics began to function as 
"proofs of competence" and a means of upward social and occupational mobility, based upon 
meritocratic performance (see Artz, 1966, pp. 66-67; Hacker, 1989, pp. 60-66; Noble, 1977, 
pp. 20-32; Schneider, 1981). In the process, mathematics tests came to serve as determinants 
of educational success or failure (Hacker, 1990, p. 141). Proficiency in math and science 
came to be used as indicators&mdash;both cultural and technical&mdash;of rationality (Hodgkin, 
1981), and of self-discipline and "habits of industry" (Cardwell, 1957). 
</p>
<p>The ascendance of math and science as prominent features and filters in the educa-
tional system has gendered significance. Technical, particularly engineering, education 
in the United States became situated, directly and indirectly, within a masculine, military 
model. In direct modeling, engineering education was founded in the United States at the 
Military Academy at West Point (1821), patterned on the French Ecole Polytechnic' 
</p>
<p>' The term "engineering" had its origins in the fifteenth century, and denoted the design of devices for warfare. In 
</p>
<p>1747, the first formal school of engineering, the Ecole Nationale des Fonts et Chausses (National School of Bridges 
</p>
<p>and Roads), was established in France. At the end of the eighteenth century, engineering began to acquire standing 
</p>
<p>as a discipline, and the qualifier "civil" engineering was applied to indicate its extramilitary applications (for an 
</p>
<p>overview of "the birth of engineering," see Ambrose, Dunkle, Lazarus, Nair, &amp; Harkus, 1997, pp. 13-14). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Hierarchy, and Science 443 
</p>
<p>Indirectly, the military institutions constructed technical "competition, merit, and espe-
cially discipline and control [that] defined both masculinity and success" (Hacker, 1989, 
p. 66). More currently, engineering faculty interviewed about the importance of calculus 
and other forms of mathematics in the curriculum believed that it had "little relevance for 
job performance," but stressed it as important "to show that you can do it" and "to de-
velop a proper frame of mind" (Hacker, 1990, p. 149). 
</p>
<p>Science also structured higher education more broadly. In the United States, science 
and higher education have evolved, in fact, as "reciprocal developments" (see Fox, 1996, 
pp. 266-268). First, from the nineteenth century onward, science acted to break up the 
generalist curriculum that trained graduates for ministry, law, or government service. 
Science helped introduce to the curriculum lectures, seminars, and independent work 
that largely replaced classical pedagogy emphasizing drill and recitation. Second, sci-
ence paved the way for graduate education across fields, and in like manner, led the way 
in securing federal support for research and training. Third, with specialization, federal 
support for research, and winning of autonomy in research&mdash;forces largely related to 
developments in science&mdash;the university became decentralized. Power in making appoint-
ments and in controlling research funds moved from central administration to academic 
departments. Such decentralization has come to define the complex university, which 
continues to dominate higher education in the United States. Within academia&mdash;and for 
the public support and funding essential to it&mdash;science became a model (albeit fre-
quently faltering) of research expertise and a standard for research training and ap-
prenticeship. 
</p>
<p>1.1.1.2. Science and the State. As with education, a strong institutional connection 
between science and the state points to science as an operant of power&mdash;and grasping this 
connection is important to understanding science as a focal case in the sociology of gender. 
</p>
<p>The connection between science and the larger political order is such that science 
and the larger political order are created and re-created, reciprocally&mdash;so that they sus-
tain each other (see Cozzens &amp; Woodhouse, 1995; Jasanoff et al., 1995, pp. 527-531). 
The root is this: science costs, and the government finances. The state, in turn, has a 
strong stake in science. 
</p>
<p>Science is supported largely through public funds, distributed through federal agen-
cies. In 1989, 20 U.S. federal agencies each spent more than 50 million dollars on re-
search, with six agencies&mdash;National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration, Department of Energy, National Science 
Foundation, and Department of Agriculture-accounting for 90% of all federal support 
for research (Morin, 1993, Table 4-1). 
</p>
<p>Under the "social contract for science"-an arrangement originally outlined by 
Vannevar Bush (1945/1990)&mdash;the federal government provides funds for basic research 
and scientific training, and agrees not to interfere with scientific decision-making, in 
exchange for unspecified benefits to the public good expected to result ultimately from 
science. In practice, however, scientific research and resulting knowledge are infused 
with the assumptions and interests of both scientists and their federal sponsors (Cozzens 
&amp; Woodhouse, 1995). The shaping of scientific research by sponsors and their public and 
congressional constituencies is manifest in areas such as oceanography, funded by the 
Office of Naval Research, "the war on cancer," and research attention to AIDS and to 
Alzheimer's disease, funded by National Institutes of Health. Scientific products and 
attainments have been taken as gauges of national resourcefulness, power, and prestige. </p>

</p>
<p>1.1.1.3. The Ethos of Science. Underlying the public support of science is an ethos that 
helps justify the federal investment and also makes science a strategic case for analysis of 
gendered hierarchies. As articulated over 50 years ago by Robert Merton (1942/1973), 
the normative structure of science has an ethos of "universalism," which prescribes that 
social relations be governed by "uniform terms." This is contrasted with "particularism," 
relations governed by "particular properties" of people. Universalism entails two con-
nected requirements: (1) When a scientist offers a contribution to scientific knowledge, 
the scientific community's assessment of the validity of that claim should not be influ-
enced by the scientist's personal or social attributes (such as race or gender). (2) Relatedly, 
a scientist should be rewarded for contributions, with "careers open to talent" and with 
characteristics such as race and gender irrelevant for making claims and gaining rewards.^ 
</p>
<p>Science has been characterized both as a universalistic institution and as one in which 
universalistic standards fall short (see Cole, 1992, pp. 157-176; Mitroff, 1974; and Mulkay, 
1976 for a review of this debate). At the same time, however, it is well established that 
science is an institution with immense inequality in career attainments and rewards 
(Zuckerman, 1988, pp. 526-527). Whether the inequality is "equitable" or "inequitable" 
depends upon the extent to which it can be explained by normatively justifiable&mdash;largely 
merit or achievement-based&mdash;criteria (see, e.g., Fox, 1981). For the purposes here, the 
"scientific ethos," with its belief-system of race-, gender-, and ethnic-neutrality, height-
ens the strategic value of science as a focal case for analysis of gender stratification in 
career attainments, and in arguments about the construction of scientific knowledge. 
</p>
<p>2. GENDER, HIERARCHY, AND CAREER 
</p>
<p>ATTAINMENTS IN SCIENCE' 
</p>
<p>Gender shapes participation, location, rank, performance, and rewards in science. Women 
have long been "in science," but not central to science, in significant or influential roles 
(see accounts in Rossiter, 1982; Zuckerman, Cole, &amp; Bruer, 1991). Before World War II, 
in the United States, women with doctoral degrees* in science were often unemployed, 
and if employed, had prospects limited to either working in a dependent position as a 
research associate in a laboratory controlled by the principal investigator, or teaching in 
a women's college where human and material resources for research were modest to 
negligible (Rossiter, 1982). 
</p>
<p>2.1. Participation 
</p>
<p>Over the century, levels of women's and men's participation in science are difficult to 
track precisely, because data on employment levels by gender are not available systemati-
cally over time. However, data on doctoral degrees awarded are, and they indicate the 
proportions of women compared to men who were professionally trained, and thus quali-
fied for participation. 
</p>
<p>These proportions do not represent a simple, linear trend of increasing improvement 
</p>
<p>^ See Long and Fox (1995) for a current assessment of the meaning, measurement, conditions for, and problems of 
</p>
<p>"universalism and particularism" in scientific careers. 
</p>
<p>-' Data and discussion on gender and career attainments draw from Fox (1995, 1996) and Long and Fox (1995). 
</p>
<p>'' This chapter focuses upon doctoral-level scientists, because it is for this group that issues of research and research 
</p>
<p>productivity and impact are most pertinent. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Hierarchy, and Science 445 
</p>
<p>in degrees attained by women. The proportions of doctoral degrees awarded to women 
compared to men in the United States' in the 1920s (12.3%) and the 1930s (11%) are 
higher than the proportions in the 1940s (8.9%), the 1950s (6.7%), or even the 1960s 
(7.9%).* It was the 1970s before the proportions of doctoral degrees awarded to women 
(14.9%) equaled or surpassed the pre-1940 proportions. Continuing gains were made in 
the 1980s, and for the period 1980-1988, women earned 26% of all doctoral degrees in 
science (Fox, 1995, p. 206). 
</p>
<p>In 1993, women were 20% of the employed doctoral level scientists in the United 
States compared with 14% a decade earlier (CPST, 1997, Table 4-16). Employment of 
women is disproportionately low in the scientific workforce of most industrialized na-
tions. Although less is known about participation by gender in developing countries of 
Africa, Latin America, and Asia, the trends show women's proportional participation to 
be as low or lower than in industrialized nations (Rathgeber, 1995). 
</p>
<p>With the exception of Asians, participation of U.S. ethnic and racial minorities is 
disproportionately low in science. In 1993, 2.1% of doctoral level scientists and engi-
neers were African-American, 11% were Asian, 0.37% were Native American, and 2% 
were Hispanic (CPST, 1997, Table 4-16). Beyond their low rates of participation, rela-
tively little is known about the conditions and experiences of racial/ethnic minorities in 
science. Racial and ethnic minorities have been regarded by researchers as a "statistical 
rarity" (Bechtel, 1989), groups for whom detailed, reliable data have been difficult to 
obtain and for whom inferences have been difficult to make (Cole &amp; Cole, 1973, pp. 152-
153). Few studies include racially comparative groups, and much remains to be known 
about the status and attainments of racial and ethnic groups in science. What we know 
about women as an aggregate, which of course, includes both white and nonwhite women, 
is much broader (Long &amp; Fox, 1995, pp. 48-49). 
</p>
<p>As to why so few women "choose" science compared to other areas such as arts, 
humanities, and social services, the answer lies in a complex set of factors that are diffi-
cult to untangle. Given limitations of space and focus, these factors can only be briefly 
addressed. They include: (1) social constructions of what is regarded as appropriate work 
for women, and thus issues of social and gender identity; (2) an educational "pipeline" 
for science fields that starts early in life and forms a tracked and ordered sequence of 
study; (3) perceived barriers for women in science compared to other fields; and (4) 
inequitable resources and opportunities offered to women compared to men in both edu-
cation for, and professional attainment in, science (Evetts, 1996; Hanson, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Beyond their rates of participation, women and men employed in science are differ-
entiated in the fields they occupy, the places they work, and the ranks they hold, as well as 
their levels of research productivity, addressed in the following sections. 
</p>
<p>2.2. Fields 
</p>
<p>Between fields, the distributions of women and men are highly uneven (Table 20-1). In 
</p>
<p>1993, the vast majority (82%) of women were in three fields&mdash;Ufe sciences, psychology, 
</p>
<p>' National data on scientific personnel are compiled by the National Research Council (Survey of Earned Doctor-
</p>
<p>ates, and Survey of Doctoral Recipients) and National Science Foundation (Survey of Graduate Students and 
</p>
<p>Postdoctprates in Science and Engineering), In this chapter, data referred to are for U.S. scientists, unless other-
</p>
<p>wise indicated. 
</p>
<p>' Although the number of degrees awarded to women increased in post-1920 decades, the point is that the women's 
</p>
<p>proportion of total degrees awarded decreased. </p>

</p>
<p>and social sciences. In contrast, only half of men were employed in these fields. Men were 
twice as likely as women to be in physical, computer, and environmental sciences, and six 
times more likely to be in engineering. 
</p>
<p>These distributions of women and men by field suggest nonuniform processes of 
selection by field (both self-selection and selection by institutions). However, the factors 
governing employment by field, particularly the higher proportions of women in life 
sciences and men in physical sciences, are not well understood (Zuckerman, 1987, p. 
128). Even less is known about gender distributions by research subfield, such as new 
compared to established, high-growth compared to low-growth, and more theoretical (basic) 
compared to less theoretical (applied) areas, and the consequences of such distributions 
for resources acquired and impact made in science (Fox, 1995, p. 209). 
</p>
<p>2.3. Locations 
</p>
<p>Within science, women and men are employed in different sectors. As of 1993, doctoral-
level women in science were more likely than men to be located in educational institu-
tions (52% vs. 47%), and less hkely to be in industry (21% vs. 33%). The higher propor-
tion of women compared to men in educational institutions and the lower proportion in 
industry reflect the disparate proportions of doctoral level women and men in engineer-
ing, in particular. Compared to other fields, engineering is more likely to be practiced in 
the industrial sector. 
</p>
<p>Education is the predominate sector for doctoral&mdash;level scientists&mdash;and the vast pre-
ponderance (over 90%) of those in education are in higher education. Stratification in 
science is linked to stratification in higher education. Key here is that the activities and 
resources of science departments&mdash;their research projects, graduate training programs, 
and external funding&mdash;contribute heavily to the prestige-, revenue-, and ranking-levels 
of academic institutions. Universities with active research programs, strong graduate edu-
cation, and external funding have the highest ranking. Those with undergraduate only 
programs have lower ranking, although these vary with the selectivity of admissions and 
credentials of the faculty. Comprehensive colleges, which evolved from teacher's col-
leges, have vaguer identity and lower distinction (Clark, 1987). 
</p>
<p>The data on women's and men's location within types of academic institutions are </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Hierarchy, and Science 447 
</p>
<p>for broad classifications: universities, 4-year colleges, medical schools, and 2-year col-
leges. The university category, for example, is aggregated across type of institutions, 
except medical schools. What the data show (Table 20-2) is that in 1987 (the most recent 
year for which these data are available), 70% of the men were concentrated in universi-
ties (excluding medical colleges); in contrast, 57% of the women worked in these loca-
tions. Women were more apt than men to be in medical schools&mdash;21% of the women 
compared to 13% of the men were employed in these settings. This may reflect the con-
centration of women in life sciences and the fact that microbiology programs are often 
located in medical schools; it may also reflect the large number of low-ranking, off-track 
positions (instructorships, lectureships) in those settings. Few scientists were in precollege 
settings, but women were three times more likely than men (4% vs. 1.3%) to work in 
these lower-prestige institutions (Fox, 1996, pp. 269-270). 
</p>
<p>The difference in the proportion of women and men scientists working in universi-
ties, which must be considered in combination with their ranks within them, is notable 
because it is in universities that time, equipment, and facilities for research, and graduate 
students' involvement in research projects, are concentrated. These resources provide the 
ways and means for research performance, to be discussed subsequently.

<p>In academia, ranks are clearly, and in most cases uniformly, specified as professorial 
levels and thus revealing of career attainments by gender. Because of the variable, non-
uniform titles for scientists across nonacademic locations, it is difficult to determine pat-
terns of gender and rank for these locations. 
</p>
<p>In considering academic rank, we need to look at distributions of women and men by 
rank&mdash;that is, the proportion of women and of men who hold levels of professorial posi-
tions in science. It is also important to consider women as a proportion of faculty at each 
rank. This proportion reflects women's participation or nonparticipation relative to men 
by rank, and the availability of women at higher ranks for matters of influence in teach-
ing and research. Thus, while a given department may have three women, and the distri-
bution is one woman at each rank, what is equally, or more, important as an indicator of 
status by gender is the proportion of faculty that women represent at each rank. 
</p>
<p>Considering first the distributions of women and men by rank, we find gender in-
equalities at the upper and lower ranks. Most notably, in 1993,44% of the men compared

<p>to 17% of the women were full professors; 35% of the women were at the level of assis-
tant professor or lower, compared to 15% of the men (CPST, 1997: calculated from Table 
5-1). 
</p>
<p>Second, examining the proportion of women compared to men at each rank, the 
pattern is one of marked disparity by gender (Table 20-3). Across science and engineer-
ing fields, the higher the rank, the lower the proportion of women. As of 1993, women 
were 32% of the assistant professors, 22% of the associate professors, and 10% of the full 
professors. While this pattern prevails across fields, certain fields have stronger gender 
disparity by rank. Just as women are concentrated in three fields&mdash;life science, psychol-
ogy, and social science&mdash;so correspondingly, in these fields we find higher proportions of 
women at each rank. In life sciences, psychology, and social sciences, women were 38%, 
47%, and 32%, respectively, of assistant professors; and 28%, 33%, and 26%, respec-
tively, of the associate professors. 
</p>
<p>However, for each field except psychology, the proportions of women at the rank of 
full professor are meager. In half of the field-categories&mdash;that is, in physical, mathemati-
cal, and environmental sciences and engineering&mdash;women are 6% or fewer of full profes-
sors. Only in psychology are women more than 13% of the full professors. 
</p>
<p>Despite the number of women with doctorates earned in the 1970s and 1980s and 
the passage of years for these women to have matured in professional terms, the propor-
tion of women who are full professors has not kept pace with the growth of women with 
doctorates. In 1973, women were 4% of the full professors in science and engineering

<p>fields, in 1987, that proportion was 7%, and in 1993, still just 10%; and these figures are 
inflated by the numbers of women in psychology (also see Gibbons, 1992). 
</p>
<p>Even allowing up to 15 years from doctorate to full professor, women's degrees are 
not translating into expected rank over time. Such discrepancies are documented in chem-
istry, in mathematics, indeed across fields in higher education (American Statistical As-
sociation, 1993, p. 4; University of Wisconsin, 1991, p. ix; Vetter, 1992, pp. 37-38). In 
chemistry, for example, at doctoral-granting institutions between 1985 and 1990, women 
went from 11 % to 18% of assistant professors; from 9% to 13% of associate professors; 
but only from 3% to 4% of full professors (Roscher, 1990, pp. 72-73). These proportions 
are to be considered against the growth in women's share of doctoral degrees awarded in 
chemistry: 7.7% in 1970, 11% in 1975, 17% in 1980, 20% in 1985, and 25% in 1990 
(National Center for Education Statistics, 1993, Table 240; Roscher, 1990, Table 11)&mdash; 
and the maturation of the cohorts over the period. 
</p>
<p>These data on gender and rank and those on discrepancy between the availability of 
women with doctorates and rank over time do not control for research productivity. Stud-
ies that do, however, indicate that academic rank may be the area of greatest gender 
disparity in scientific career attainments. Accordingly, Cole (1979) found that for scien-
tists at each productivity level considered, men had higher average rank than women. 
This held for scientists in institutions at varying levels of prestige. Further, with a sample 
of biochemists who received Ph.D.s between 1956 and 1967, Long, Allison, and McGinnis 
(1993) found that rates of promotion from assistant to associate to full professor were 
lower and slower for women than for men. Being in a prestigious department delays 
promotion for both genders, but the effect is stronger for women. In addition, in their 
study of recipients of prestigious postdoctoral fellowships between 1955 and 1986, Sonnert 
and Holton (1995a) found that women's lower rank cannot be explained by their lower 
productivity, because women's rank is lower at each level of productivity. The disadvan-
tage in rank for women was concentrated in fields outside of biology, that is, in physical 
sciences, mathematics, and engineering. This highlights again the issue of gender pat-
terns by field in science. 
</p>
<p>2.5. Research Productivity 
</p>
<p>Research productivity refers to actual outcomes of research&mdash;in basic science&mdash;publica-
tions. Publication productivity is not strictly equivalent to research productivity, but the 
one (publication) is an indicator of the other (research). No guarantee exists that a big 
producer of publications makes a significant contribution or that a given nonpublisher 
makes no contribution. However, in the aggregate, the correlation is high between quan-
tity of publications and impact, assessed through awards and recognition in science (see 
Blume &amp; Sinclair, 1973; Cole &amp; Cole, 1973; Gaston, 1978). 
</p>
<p>In the analysis of gender and career attainments in science, publication productivity 
is important for three reasons. First, publication is an important social process of science, 
because it is through publication that research findings are communicated and verified, 
and that priority of work is established (see Fox, 1983). Second, and accordingly, until we 
understand productivity differences, we cannot adequately assess other gender differ-
ences in location, rank, and rewards, because they are related to&mdash;although not wholly 
explained by&mdash;^productivity (Fox, 1991). Third, as discussed in the Introduction, the "ethos 
of science" is that "merit governs rewards in science," and that factors such as gender and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>450 Mary Frank Fox 
</p>
<p>race are illegitimate determinants. Because publication is a indicator of merit in and 
contributions to science, it is important in assessing whether science abides by or abro-
gates its manifest value-system. The extent to which science is "universalistic," with 
contributions to knowledge governing rewards, or "particularistic," with personal fac-
tors, such as race and gender, accounting for rewards, has probably been the most widely 
debated issue in the sociology of science (Cole, 1992: Long &amp; Fox, 1995; Zuckerman, 
1988). 
</p>
<p>What do we know about the publication productivity of women and men? First, as 
described in Fox (1995), numbers of studies indicate that women publish less than men. 
Across fields, women publish about half as much as men in a given period. Over a 12-
year period, across the fields of chemistry, biology, psychology, and sociology. Cole (1979) 
reports that the median number of papers published was eight for men and three for 
women. In a sample of women and men scientists matched by field and year of Ph.D., as 
well as doctoral department. Cole and Zuckerman (1984) found that women published 
6.4 papers, compared to 11.2 for men. Although particular levels of gender difference 
vary by field, women are found to publish significantly fewer papers than men in chemis-
try (Reskin, 1978), biochemistry (Long et al., 1993), ecology (Primack &amp; O'Leary, 1989), 
and psychology (Helmreich, Spence, Beane, Lucker, &amp; Matthews, 1980), as well as four 
social science fields (Fox, 1995). For biological and social sciences, the gap between 
women's and men's number of publications has been narrowing more recently (Sonnert 
&amp; Holton, 1995a; Ward &amp; Grant, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Second, while women and men publish at different rates, the distribution for both is 
strongly skewed: low, even null, performance is most frequent, and high, or even moder-
ate, performance is rare (Fox, 1995). To put it differently, the distribution of productivity 
is such that most work is produced by a few, while the majority publish little (Cole &amp; 
Zuckerman, 1984). This pattern of highly variable and strongly skewed productivity, 
documented nearly 75 years ago in Lotka's (1926) analysis of physics journals, is charac-
teristic of both men and women in science. 
</p>
<p>Publication productivity is both cause and effect of gender disparity in career attain-
ments. That is, it both reflects women's depressed rank and prestige of institutional loca-
tions, and it partially accounts for that status (Fox, 1991). "Partially" is the key term: 
holding constant levels of publication productivity, women's attainments in science, es-
pecially rank, remain lower than men's, as discussed previously. Although understanding 
is incomplete of the processes leading to gender disparity in career attainments, the evi-
dence is that "universalism falters in science" and that "women are less able to translate 
their productivity into resources and recognition" (Long &amp; Fox, 1995, p. 68). 
</p>
<p>3. GENDER, HIERARCHY, AND KNOWLEDGE IN SCIENCE 
</p>
<p>In positivist' tradition, the scientist is depicted as a "model of impartiality, a passive 
</p>
<p>observer, collector and collator of natural facts, someone whose activities [are] unsullied 
</p>
<p>by personal bias or emotion, unscarred by political and religious standing, or by cultural 
</p>
<p>values . . . " (Benjamin, 1991, p. 6). In such representations, science is "other-worldly"&mdash; 
</p>
<p>disembodied, extrasocial, culturally neutral, governed by it own internal logic and coher-
</p>
<p>ence. 
</p>
<p>' The essence of positivism is its tenet tliat the content of science is determined by "reality" or "facts." </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Hierarchy, and Science 451 
</p>
<p>In the 1970s, a sociology of scientific knowledge, developed in Europe, countered 
the positivist view that science merely reveals nature, with scientists acting as neutral 
agents or mediators. The work of Barnes (1974), Bloor (1976), and Mulkay (1979), for 
example, emphasizes ways in which social, political, and economic interests of particular 
groups construct scientific findings and generalizations. Sociologists of scientific knowl-
edge have been slower to point to ways in which science and technology reflect and 
reinforce the interests of&mdash;and systems based upon dominance by&mdash;gender (Harding, 
1983). 
</p>
<p>A feminist analysis, which asserts that "evidence is a question of interpretation, and 
theories are accounts of and for specific kinds of lives," including those of women and of 
men (Harraway, 1989, p. 8), has popular roots in the women's health movement of the 
late 1960s and early 1970s, and classic volumes associated with it (Boston Women's 
Health Collective, 1971/1976; Ehrenreich &amp; English, 1973). The women's health move-
ment has challenged scientific medical knowledge, as produced by men and applied to 
women; knowledge that has been thought to define women in ways that supported female 
subordination and inferiority. More specifically, the movement has challenged a "sexual 
politics of sickness and health," that constructed women as "weak, dependent, and dis-
eased," female functions of menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth as "pathologies," 
and menopause as "terminal illness," "the death of the woman in the woman" (Ehrenreich 
&amp; English, 1978, pp. 92-100). Parallel critiques have posed correspondence between 
women's subordination and the domination of "nature," that is, land and earth as femi-
nine entities, subject to exploitation and control by men (Kolodny, 1975; Merchant, 1980; 
Ortner, 1972). 
</p>
<p>With this feminist analysis of medicine in particular, critical "floodgates" opened: 
</p>
<p>If medical knowledge&mdash;as one form of scientific knowledge&mdash;was patriarchal, then what about the 
</p>
<p>rest of science, in which men were similarly dominant? What about other forms of systemic knowl-
</p>
<p>edge? Was the whole intellectual realm gender-biased? Was there more than one kind of rationality? 
</p>
<p>Was there a 'male' and a 'female' rationality? Or was 'rationality' itself a tainted concept denoting 
</p>
<p>a blinkered and limited approach to understanding the human condition? (McNeil, 1987, pp. 29-
</p>
<p>30) 
</p>
<p>The critique of medicine has encouraged resistance to other knowledge and exper-
tise as power relations between men and women. This has included challenge to dogmas 
of psychiatry: theories and concepts such as "female masochism," female achievement as 
"castrating" and "unwomanly drives to power," and of periodic maternal absence as "dep-
rivation of children." Further, speculation has arisen about the ways in which gender may 
shape the meaning of scientific knowledge more broadly&mdash;the ways in which scientific 
questions are framed, data interpreted, and applications made. 
</p>
<p>These considerations of mind, nature, and masculinity (Fox, 1986) are represented 
especially in the work of Evelyn Fox Keller (1985, 1995, and elsewhere), who maintains 
that science is inherently masculine in character, not just male dominated in numbers. 
The consequence, Keller argues, is not simply an exclusion of women, but a schism be-
tween masculine and feminine, subjective and objective, understanding and control. She 
argues, for example, that the tension between scientific explanations that stress hierar-
chies and unidirectional causal paths and those that stress multiple interactions and mul-
tidirectional pathways stem from different and gendered views of nature, domination, 
and control (Keller, 1985). 
</p>
<p>Analyses of gender and scientific knowledge have flourished at a philosophical level 
(although not at an empirical level), and have been the basis for theorizing about the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>452 Mary Frank Fox 
</p>
<p>possibility of a more diverse&mdash;including a feminist&mdash;science. What might such science 
look like, and how would it be practiced? Would a different agenda of problems or meth-
ods be pursued? What values might prevail? 
</p>
<p>Keller's (1983) biography of geneticist, Barbara McClintock, portrays a struggle 
between ideology and practice in the production and interpretation of science. In doing 
so, it depicts the science of a woman who was a theoretical and methodological maverick 
in genetics. McClintock challenged the "master molecule theory" of genetic control within 
a hierarchical organization. She integrated (rather than divided) subject and self in scien-
tific investigation, and respected "difference" in the organism (maize) rather than aiming 
for a cosmic unity of control. McClintock offered a different view of nature, a view of 
subject and object that were outside the mainstream and, Keller argues, outside of gen-
der-defined definitions and boundaries. After being largely underappreciated, McClintock 
was awarded a Nobel Prize in her 80s for work she had began 40 years earlier. 
</p>
<p>In interviews with women and men scientists, few report that they believe a "male" 
or "female" scientific method or orientation operates (as in profiles in Sonnert &amp; Holton, 
1995b and Zuckerman et al., 1991). However, in systematic case studies, a pattern of 
gendered behavioral practice is perceived by the scientists interviewed and observed by 
the investigators, Sonnert and Holton (1995b): "women are more cautious and careful in 
their methods and pay more attention to detail" (p. 152). This tendency is a response to 
the conditions experienced, with women reporting the need to "prove themselves," "avoid 
failure and criticism," "be meticulous," "do more comprehensive work" (pp. 152-153). 
This suggests that women have&mdash;and take&mdash;less latitude with error or mistakes in their 
work. Such practices are consistent with women's lower rate of publication productivity, 
and also with women's citation rates, which, per article, are as high or higher than men's 
(Sonnert &amp; Holton, 1995b; p. 153; see also Long, 1992). Compared to men, the pattern 
for women may be "lower quantity and higher quality." 
</p>
<p>Critiques of medicine and biology have maintained that in studying certain subjects, 
particularly bodies, health, and sickness, male scientists reveal themselves as much as 
"men" as "scientists" (McNeil, 1987, p. 31). Meanings of gender and gender hierarchies 
are reflected in this knowledge, and in turn, the scientific knowledge reifies patterns of 
male superordination and female subordination. It is less clear how such meanings may 
operate outside of life sciences, in areas of chemistry and physics, for example. Further, 
although speculation has flourished about the possibilities of diverse, including feminist, 
science, the inquiry has been at a philosophical level, and empirical studies have been 
few. Case studies, such as Sonnert's and Holton's, are useful is disclosing how gender 
influences modes of scientific behavior. As to whether gender influences theories of the 
natural and physical world and patterns and approaches of inquiry remains an ongoing 
question. 
</p>
<p>4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
</p>
<p>Science is an institutional medium of power that connects with central social institutions, 
</p>
<p>particularly education and the state, and is marked by immense inequality in status and 
</p>
<p>rewards. It is a fundamentally hierarchical institution, and its valued attributes of ratio-
</p>
<p>nality and control have been more ascribed to men than to women. Science represents a 
</p>
<p>strategic site for study of gender in hierarchical context&mdash;and in summary, it reflects and 
</p>
<p>supports gender stratification in these ways: </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Hierarchy, and Science 453 
</p>
<p>1. Science is disproportionately done by men, and moreover, controlled by men. 
Compared to women, men are more likely to be located in universities than in 
four year colleges; to be in more powerful fields&mdash;physical, mathematical, envi-
ronmental, and computer sciences and engineering*; to hold high rank; and to 
experience higher levels of research productivity, as both cause and effect of their 
status. Thus, gender shapes participation, location, rank, and performance in 
science. 
</p>
<p>2. Because science is a source of power and is characterized by such gender divi-
sions and hierarchies in participation, location, rank, and productivity, it exem-
plifies gendered relations. Owing to its powerful domains, science not only re-
flects, but also serves to expand gender stratification in society. 
</p>
<p>3. Historically, in areas of medicine and biology, especially, science has defined 
women in ways that have supported female subordination and inferiority and 
male superordination&mdash;and has done so from a position of "authoritative knowl-
edge." In this way, science has been an agent in constructing and supporting 
hierarchical definitions of gender. 
</p>
<p>4. The extent to which gender shapes the content and methods of science, including 
the ways in which questions are framed, approaches are taken, and interpreta-
tions are formed, remains open to inquiry. If the authority of a dominant scien-
tific culture defines the cognitive content of science, and if that authority is gen-
der-specific, then the connection between gender and science will prove to be yet 
more profound than analyzed here. 
</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is notable that research, policy, and practice on issues of women 
and men in science have focused frequently upon "increasing the numbers of women in 
science" (Fox, 1998). Gender disparity in participation is a complex issue, and a justifi-
able concern for reasons of utilization of underrepresented groups as human resources, 
and for social equity. However, increasing numbers of women will not necessarily change 
patterns of gender and hierarchy in science. 
</p>
<p>Women have long been present in science, although not in valued, highly rewarded, 
or even visible roles. Accounts have documented how the contributions of both outstand-
ing and little-known women scientists have been marginalized, misunderstood, or 
miscredited to others (see, particularly, Rossiter, 1982; Sayre, 1975). Further and relatedly, 
for science as for other professions, the relationship between gender, education, and sta-
tus is complex&mdash;not a simple matter of increasing education and increasing social and 
economic status. We have seen that the proportion of women who are full professors has 
not kept pace with the growth in the number of women with doctorates in science, and 
that women's educational attainments do not translate into career attainments, especially 
advancement in rank, on a par with men's. The idea of education, by itself, as emblematic 
of progress for women in science is questionable (Fox, 1996, p. 278). 
</p>
<p>In addition, to the extent that increasing numbers of women are present in science 
but hide their "difference," gender neutrality, and, in turn, a hidden "male norm," are 
likely to prevail (Cockburn &amp; Furst-Dilic, 1994). For example, if women attempt to con-
ceal, obscure, and "overcome" certain observed (Sonnert &amp; Holton, 1995b) behavioral 
styles, such as tendencies to confirm and integrate research findings before releasing

<p>decades. </p>

<p>them for publication, tiie pattern of proliferation of fragmented pieces of published work 
may continue to constitute an unchallenged standard for scientific productivity.' It is not 
the mere "difference" in any style that is critical, or that men and women in science differ 
widely in their practices. Rather, what is important is the power to determine and main-
tain what is a valued standard and what is not, and the adherence of groups to such 
designated standards. 
</p>
<p>In science, as in any other institution, some groups benefit from existing arrange-
ments, and others do not. Men in science have been more likely than women to benefit in 
institutional locations, rank, promotion, and access to human and material resources, as 
well as a culture and climate that reflects their understandings and interests. Because 
there are beneficiaries, strong incentives exist to preserve current arrangements. These 
include arrangements such as autonomy of the advisor in relationships with students; 
relatively nonsystematic criteria in hiring, promotion, and allocation of rewards; and 
limited accountability in evaluation of students and faculty (see Fox, 1998). Such organi-
zational arrangements have advantages for the institution: they enable flexible and rapid 
response to problems by individual groups, for example (Harrison, 1994). However, the 
same factors (individual autonomy, nonsystematic processes, limited accountability) have 
also been found to activate "particularistic considerations"&mdash;bias in the allocation of re-
wards on the basis of "social similarity" (including race and gender) to those who cur-
rently dominate'" (see Fox, 1991; Long &amp; Fox, 1995, pp. 62-64). 
</p>
<p>The prevailing focus and attention upon "increasing numbers of women in science" 
are understandable. Increasing the presence of women, and other underrepresented groups 
such as African-Americans and Hispanics, can occur without changing the conditions of 
work or the current distribution of power in science. The challenge ahead is not simply an 
attempt to increase the flow of women through the proverbial "scientific pipeline" and fit 
them to existing structures. Rather, it is to better understand&mdash;and possibly be so bold as 
to modify&mdash;gendered hierarchy, practices, and processes, and their consequences for sci-
entific organizations, occupations, and institutions.

<p>CHAPTER 21 
</p>
<p>Gender and Health Status 
</p>
<p>JENNIE JACOBS KRONENFELD 
</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>Compared to other areas of gender sociology, health is one in which issues of gender as a 
social construct and sex as a physiological construct intersect to the largest extent. Clearly, 
physiological differences between men and women play a role in health status. Moreover, 
some of the major life events that also relate to health have a physiological basis (child-
bearing, menstruation, menopause). Thus, variation in health status between men and 
women, and in the importance of various types of diseases and health problems, is a 
complex mixture of both gender as a sociocultural factor and physiological variations 
between men and women, as well as individual-level variation among men and women. 
The last 20 years have seen an increased importance placed on genetics and genetic 
factors in health status, resulting in heightened emphasis on biology and physiology in 
explaining variation in health status. In fact, genetics as an explanatory factor for differ-
ences in health status is now viewed by epidemiologists as more important than at any 
other time in the history of medicine. 
</p>
<p>In an era of growing emphasis on genetics and heredity in health status, the role of 
social factors must still be addressed. The importance of gender (as one among several 
major social factors) in health care use and in variation in how people respond to illness 
continues to receive a great deal of attention by social scientists and growing interest 
within the health services research community as well. This topic is addressed in the next 
chapter, however, in terms of the topic of this chapter, health status and gender, current 
research has focused less attention on social factors. Nonetheless, one important debate 
in recent studies concerns the role of factors such as income and racial/ethnic classifica-

<p>tion as social categories rather than as physiologically based comparisons (Cooper &amp; 
David, 1986; Krieger &amp; Fee, 1994a). Some of these studies focus on gender and sexism as 
well as race/ethnicity and racism as interactional processes and their implications for 
health status (Krieger, 1990; Krieger, Rowley, Herman, Avery, &amp; Phillips, 1993). When 
gender constitutes the specific focus, one issue is often the interplay between social as-
sumptions about men and women and physiological and genetic differences. 
</p>
<p>Psychosocial factors are likely to affect the health of men and women differentially 
because they often engage in social roles that differ in quality if not in quantity. At present 
in U.S. society, as well as in most others, differences in role expectations; role burdens 
related to domains of paid work and family; and imbalances in power, equality, and con-
trol are all factors likely to create differentiation in health status between men and women 
(Rodin &amp; Ickovics, 1990). These psychosocial factors go far beyond genetics, although 
genetic differences will underlie health status variations. 
</p>
<p>A recent book on women's health has argued that models of women's health need to 
be reconceptualized (Ruzek, Olesen, &amp; Clarke, 1997). The editors argue that models of 
health need to emerge that reflect the social, not just the biological, dimensions of health 
and illness. For the most complete models, psychological and spiritual dimensions could 
also be added. In addition, they suggest that if women's health is conceptualized as em-
bedded in communities, not just in women's individual bodies, this would help to expand 
the definition of health away from a more narrow disease-focused model and into a social 
model. 
</p>
<p>Interest in women's health in the United States by governmental agencies has in-
creased in recent years. In 1986, a National Conference on Women's Health Status jointly 
sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration and the Public Health Service Coordi-
nating Committee on Women's Health was held in Bethesda, Maryland (Proceedings of 
the National Conference on Women's Health, 1987). The New York Academy of Sciences 
and its section on Women in Science (the newest section in that organization) held a 
special symposium entitled "Forging A Women's Health Research Agenda" in October, 
1992 (Sechzer, Griffin, &amp; Pfafflin, 1994). One of the goals of this conference was to 
frame an agenda for future research on women's health. Based on these and other efforts, 
the National Institutes of Health have clarified policies concerning the inclusion of women 
as research subjects within almost all funded research and have funded a special Women's 
Health Study to examine issues of breast cancer, use of estrogen supplements after meno-
pause, and other health problems specific to women. Given the growing interest in the 
overall topic of women's health, no one chapter can include all the material. This chapter 
focuses most heavily on physical health status, but also includes a discussion of mental 
health issues. I also focus most heavily on gender and health status within the United 
States, although some international comparisons are briefly discussed. In the first sec-
tion, I discuss views of women held by the medical profession in an historical context, 
including placing the increasing attention to women's health within the context of the 
women's movement generally and the women's health movement specifically. The sec-
ond section deals with physical health concerns, examining overall mortality and mor-
bidity rates. The third section focuses on life cycle concerns specific to women. The last 
section before the conclusion deals with mental health issues. Some material is presented 
in several sections about specific diseases and important health behaviors, because there 
are important linkages between these topics and health status and gender, although health 
behavior and health care are addressed in more detail in Chapter 22. </p>

<p>2. HISTORICAL VIEWS HELD BY THE MEDICAL

<p>PROFESSION OF WOMEN AS PATIENTS 
</p>
<p>2.1. Views of Women Held by the Medical Profession in the Past 
</p>
<p>The history of medicine and the manner in which the field has dealt with women and 
health status has not incorporated complicated views of gender, or even complicated views 
of biological factors and health status. The introductory chapter of this volume discussed 
the biological approach used by several founders of sociology to the study of men and 
women and their assumption that males and females are innately different and unequal in 
their intellectual, emotional, and moral capacities. This negative view of women found in 
much early sociological theory is also found in medical models of women and health 
status from the 1800s. Feminist writers have amply documented how early beliefs and 
practices concerning women by the medical profession viewed many of their everyday 
physiological functions as abnormal and as the reason for viewing all women as "sick" 
most of the time (Ehrenreich &amp; English, 1972, 1973). Women were expected to be "indis-
posed" by monthly periods and pregnancy; to rest in bed and limit their social roles, 
which thus condemned women to a public image as sickly and weak. In the early writings 
of physicians in the United States, females were portrayed as weak, hypochondriacal, 
hysterical, and chronic invalids. While the worst of these stereotypes are now totally 
discredited, some of the damage remains, as in controversies about premenstrual syn-
drome (PMS) and whether this disqualifies women from certain important positions in 
society. Medical training emphasizes a distrust of natural processes and a focus on pa-
thology, so that even natural events such as pregnancy and menopause become viewed as 
situations requiring medical intervention (Klass, 1987). Given the focus on specific symp-
toms and signs in medical training, if a woman has no other pathology and does not 
demonstrate emotional problems thought common in women, reproductive functions still 
may become the foci of the greatest concern by physicians (Klass, 1987; Wilkinson &amp; 
Kitzinger, 1994).

<p>2.2. The Women's Movement and Its Impact on Views and Studies 
of Gender and Health 
</p>
<p>The gender bias of biomedicine discussed in the preceding section continued until the 
</p>
<p>1970s. Up to that point, women were omitted from much medical research on conditions 
</p>
<p>such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, unless the cancer affected specifically female 
</p>
<p>organs. Moreover, the care for women's reproductive organs was relegated to one subfield 
</p>
<p>of medicine, obstetrics-gynecology (Martin, 1987; Turshen, 1993). The resurgence of the 
</p>
<p>women's movement in the 1960s and 1970s led to the development of a new epistemol-
</p>
<p>ogy in academia that eventually influenced medicine also. One well-publicized merging 
</p>
<p>of these concerns was the publication of Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women 
</p>
<p>by the Boston Women's Health Collective (1973). The growth of a separate women's 
</p>
<p>health movement has helped increase public awareness of special problems concerning 
</p>
<p>gender and health (Geary, 1995; Ruzek, 1978). This effort to include more women in 
</p>
<p>health-related research has been led by the National Women's Health Network (Narragan, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>462 Jennie Jacobs Kronenfeld 
</p>
<p>Zones, Worcester, &amp; Grad, 1997). Over time, health problems for women began to be 
viewed more inclusively, and the medical community grew more respectful of treating 
women as mature adults, not childlike creatures who needed extra help. 
</p>
<p>Some of these trends were national and others had an international dimension as 
well. The 1980s saw the growth of the woman's movement beyond the United States and 
developed countries and the emergence of nongovernmental women's organizations. Some 
of these organizations in other countries focused on the fact that the only access many 
women had to biomedicine was through contraceptive services (Muecke, 1996). The 1994 
International Conference on Populations and Development in Cairo, Egypt, helped to 
shift the focus away from population control to a broader focus on reproductive health 
and the empowerment of women (Crane &amp; Issacs, 1995). 
</p>
<p>In the United States, one initiative, which has a long-term potential to improve the 
health of women, is the effort to include women more extensively in medical research as 
subjects. The establishment of the Office of Women's Health in the National Institutes of 
Health in 1990 helped to lead to policies requiring that women be included as subjects in 
medical research (LaRosa, 1997; Mastroianni, Faden, &amp; Federman, 1994). This broad-
ened focus is now also part of official U.N. pronouncements that stress gender equity in 
health and provide worldwide standards that governments can implement (Muecke, 1996). 
The Women's Health Initiative of NIH is one example of a major, federally funded study 
with this broadened focus. This study is examining many issues of health status specific 
to women, including the effects for menopause, the consequences of hormone replace-
ment therapy, dietary modifications and nutritional supplements on menopause, and breast 
cancer, among other problems (Cotton, 1992; Finn, 1992b). Improved knowledge about 
health conditions specific to women, as well as greater inclusion of women in studies of 
major diseases that affect both men and women, have the long-term potential to improve 
the health status of women. Despite some large, new studies that focus on women as 
research subjects, a recent review of AIDS studies found that of the 14,799 participants 
enrolled in such trials as of January, 1992, only 1151 were women (Stapleton, 1997). 
Because of such low numbers of women in studies, the Food and Drug Administration 
proposed a rule in September, 1997 that would no longer allow researchers to exclude 
women from potentially life-saving clinical trials purely on the grounds of reproductive 
toxicity concerns. The women's movement in general, as well as the women's health 
movement, have been important in leading the medical research establishment to recog-
nize previous systematic biases in the exclusion of women from much biomedical re-
search (Clancy &amp; Massion, 1992). 
</p>
<p>3. LIFE EXPECTANCY AND MORTALITY DIFFERENCES 
</p>
<p>BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN 
</p>
<p>Gender differences in life expectancy and mortality are very different in the United States 
</p>
<p>and most other nations today than they were in past centuries or even at the beginning of 
</p>
<p>the twentieth century. Until the post-Civil War period in the United States, and this cen-
</p>
<p>tury in much of the world, women had a shorter life span than men, resulting mostly from 
</p>
<p>complications of childbirth as well as from problems of chronic malnutrition in many 
</p>
<p>regions of the world (Finn, 1992a). Chronic malnutrition has often been worse for women 
</p>
<p>in many societies, because men may be fed first and take more of the available calories, 
</p>
<p>and because in situations of limited food availability, women often will limit their own </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Health Status 463 
</p>
<p>intake to provide for their children. Overall, progress in improving life expectancy for 
both sexes is one of the important achievements in U.S. health status in the twentieth 
century, with almost a 30-year improvement in life expectancy from the beginning of the 
twentieth century to the present (National Center for Health Statistics, 1992). Although 
women were already outliving men in this country by 1900, the difference then was less 
than 2 years (Phillips, Sexton, &amp; Blackman, 1997). Between 1940 and 1970, the differ-
ences in life expectancy at birth between men and women increased from 4.4 years in 
1940 to 7.6 years in 1970. The gap remained stable throughout the 1970s and then began 
to shift slightly, as male life expectancy began improving from better management of 
major chronic diseases. One important aspect of the improvement in female life expect-
ancy from 1950 to 1989 was a 90% decline in maternal mortality during that time period. 
By 1993, life expectancy at birth was 6.6 years longer for women than for men, or 78.8 
years for women versus 72.2 for men (NCHS, 1996). Projections indicate that life expect-
ancies will continue to increase for both sexes (Phillips, Sexton, &amp; Blackman, 1997). The 
advantages in health status of women are true at every life stage (Strickland, 1988). More 
male fetuses are conceived (125 male for every 100 female fetuses) but 27% more boys 
than girls die in the first year of life. By the time people reach 100, only one man is alive 
for every five women (Rodin &amp; Ickovics, 1990). In every age category, more men than 
women die. 
</p>
<p>Gender and race are both important as factors in life expectancy, although gender is 
more important than race in predicting life expectancy. Both white and African-Ameri-
can women have a longer life expectancy than men and, despite the racial gap in life 
expectancy, African-American women born in 1989 are expected to outlive white men by 
0.8 years (NCHS, 1992). While life expectancy consistently has been lower among Afri-
can-American women than among white women in the United States, trends have shifted 
back and forth over the past 30 years. Between 1970 and 1984, the difference in life 
expectEincy between African-American and white women narrowed from 7.3 to 5.1 years 
because increases in African-American women's life expectancy were outpacing those of 
white women. During the mid-1980s, however, life expectancy for African-American 
women declined somewhat and resulted in an increase in the differential (NCHS, 1996). 
The life expectancy gap between African-American and white women narrows after age 
65 to only 2 years. 
</p>
<p>While causes of death vary some by gender, changes in causes of death are occur-
ring, especially for women. Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death among 
all women, as it is among men (NCHS, 1996). If the figures are looked at separately by 
age groups, there are some differences. Heart disease is the second leading cause of death 
among women 45 to 74 years of age, following cancer. The types of cancer that are most 
important as causes of death for women are also changing. While breast cancer is still a 
very important cause of death for women, and indeed one of the causes of death most 
feared by women, lung cancer has now surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of 
cancer death among women (Strickland, 1988). For women 75 and over, heart disease is 
the leading cause of death. For men, heart disease is the leading cause of death for all 
those 45 and over, with cancer in second place. Other leading causes of death for women 
45 to 74 years of age are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, and diabetes. 
Taken together, heart disease, cancer, and stroke account for 67% of American women's 
deaths (WHO, 1992). Some racial differences occur among women. Heart disease has 
been overtaken by cancer as the leading cause of death for white women, but remains the 
leading cause of death for African-American women. Stroke and diabetes are also more </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>464 Jennie Jacobs Kronenfeld 
</p>
<p>common causes of death for African-American women; their rates of mortality from dia-
betes are twice as high as those of white women and nearly twice as high for stroke 
(Collins, Rowland, Salganicoff, &amp; Chait, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Even though the United States has seen great improvements in life expectancy, it is 
not the world leader in this statistic. For women, life expectancy at birth for women is 
highest in Japan (82.5 years for those born in 1990), followed by France with 81.5, Canada 
with 80.6, and Sweden with 80.1 years. American and British women have a similar life 
expectancy of 78.6 and 78.7, respectively (WHO, 1992). One thing that is true through-
out most of the world (with the possible exception of South Asia) is that women live 
longer than men, even in developing countries in which the average life expectancy is 
low (Kane, 1991). 
</p>
<p>An easy, but incorrect, conclusion to draw from the data presented so far is that 
because women live longer than men they enjoy a higher quality of life in terms of health 
status or that they are healthier in general than men. Why women now live longer than 
men is still a matter of debate and research, but many experts believe that females may 
have more biological protection than males in some respects, although both are at risk for 
many of the same health problems. While many of the gains in the past century in life 
expectancy for women came from reductions in maternal mortality, this area is unlikely 
to lead to further improvements in life expectancies for women except in South Asia. 
Most of the recent gains have come from reductions in mortality for people 45 years and 
older. Men have benefitted from this less than women. Men often die from a health prob-
lem while women live on but with a serious disability, so that it is much less clear that 
women achieve a higher quality of life as regards overall health status than it is that they 
live more years than do men (Collins et al., 1994). Whether this is a biological difference 
alone or a biological difference aided by social considerations (such as that women may 
monitor their health more closely than men and be more willing to visit a health provider 
quickly at signs of health problems) is not yet clear (Collins et al., 1994; Kane, 1991). 
</p>
<p>While data on specific diseases and issues for women are discussed in more detail in 
the next section as part of a discussion of changes across the life cycle, some differences 
in morbidity (sickness) need to be reviewed before considering some of the explanations 
for gender variations in health. Although men are at higher risk than women for many 
fatal diseases, women have a higher risk of incurring many nonfatal chronic conditions, 
such as some mental health problems discussed in a later section of the chapter, as well as 
such physical health problems as arthritis and osteoporosis. Arthritis is the most common 
condition for women over 45 and affected one half of all women over 65 years of age in 
1993-1994. Hypertension is less common for women under 50 than for men in the same 
age group. By age 70 to 79, however, the prevalence of hypertension is 12% higher among 
women than men (NCHS, 1996). Because so many of the conditions that are more preva-
lent among women are disabling, women tend to have higher rates of activity limitation 
and disability than do men. For example, the proportion of women 45 to 64 years of age 
with activity limitation due to arthritis was 2.7 times that of men. In 1991, the proportion 
of middle-aged and older persons reporting difficulty performing home management ac-
tivities and/or physical care activities was more than 75% higher among women than 
men (NCHS, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Differences between men and women are also noted for acute diseases and condi-
tions. Women over the age of 45 have higher rates than men of infective/parasitic dis-
eases, respiratory conditions, digestive system conditions, and injuries. Health statistics 
are better at capturing serious health problems than minor ones. Many experts believe </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Health Status 465 
</p>
<p>that health problems that women experience more often than men, such as the bother-
some symptoms of nonfatal chronic conditions and acute conditions, are less well cap-
tured by the major national and international data sets that have provided most of the 
statistics discussed so far in this chapter (Macintyre, Hunt, &amp; Sweeting, 1996; Verbrugge, 
1985). The issue of better collection of data for serious problems as compared to more 
minor problems has often been conceptualized as the "iceberg of morbidity," in which 
only a small part of total morbidity is visible through most available health statistics. 
Even though only a small part of the total "iceberg of morbidity" may be visible in health 
statistics, the gender hue of the iceberg probably varies from deeply feminine at the bot-
tom, to gradually fading, to more heavily masculine at the top, but the bulk of the iceberg 
is probably a feminine shade (Verbrugge, 1985). 
</p>
<p>One recent British review of gender differences in health concluded that the pattern 
of sex differences in morbidity is more complicated than conventional wisdom would 
assume (Macintyre et al., 1996). This article reviewed two recent British data sets and 
argued that the direction and magnitude of sex differences in health vary according to the 
particular symptom or condition and according to the life cycle phase. They found that 
only six of seventeen conditions (depression or nervous disorder, varicose veins, high 
blood pressure, migraine, piles or hemorrhoids and cancer) show a female preponderance 
at all or most ages and the differences are significant mostly for cancer. Another six 
conditions (bronchitis, other chest problems, diabetes, liver problems, epilepsy, and stroke) 
show no significant sex differences for any age group. 
</p>
<p>Two different types of explanations are discussed in the literature to account for the 
mortality and morbidity differences between men and women. One is biological and the 
second is social (Gove &amp; Hughes, 1979; Krieger &amp; Fee, 1994a; Rodin &amp; Ickovics, 1990; 
Strickland, 1988; Verbrugge, 1983, 1985, 1989; Wingard, 1982). The most important 
social explanation concerns variation by gender in patterns of health services use, expla-
nations linked to health reporting behavior and prior use of health care (mostly topics of 
the next chapter in this book). In this chapter, I focus on the contrast between biological 
explanations and social defined primarily as acquired risks. The biological explanation 
argues that women have more biological protections against early death than men. Ge-
netics are one part of a biological explanation, focusing partially on the idea that redun-
dant genetic material in the second X chromosome of females is protective. Another part 
of the biological explanation focuses upon hormonal differences between men and women, 
especially across the life cycle. The best known of these is hormonal protection from 
cardiovascular disease prior to menopause (Rodin &amp; Ickovics, 1990). Data indicate that 
estrogen may serve to keep the levels of high-density lipoproteins elevated and those of 
low-density lipoproteins lower and thus decrease the risk for heart disease (Bush et al., 
1987). Some contradictory evidence, however, is that estrogen from oral contraceptives 
appears to increase the risk of coronary heart disease in women who smoke (Mathews, 
1989). 
</p>
<p>While the biological factors are important, the social factors should not be discounted. 
The leading causes of death in the United States today are linked to dysfunctional lifestyles 
and behavior. It is estimated that as much as 50% of mortality from the leading causes of 
death overall in the population can be traced to such aspects of lifestyle as cigarette 
smoking, excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages, use of illicit drugs, harmful di-
etary practices, reckless driving, nonadherence to medication regimens, and maladaptive 
responses to social pressures (Rodin &amp; Ickovics, 1990). Moreover, some of these factors 
are interactive with each other and perhaps also with biological factors. For example. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>466 Jennie Jacobs Kronenfeld 
</p>
<p>women (especially African-American women) are more likely than men to live in poverty 
and may experience greater stress due to this difficult situation, which in turn may in-
crease the rates of many health problems. This may be one reason for the finding in some 
studies of a declining sex mortality ratio for people over 45. Social roles for women are 
undergoing major changes in many countries, and two important lifestyle changes are 
women's increased substance use and much higher rates of labor-force participation (Rodin 
&amp; Ickovics, 1990; Verbrugge, 1989). The impact of these types of social changes on 
aggregate health statistics will become much clearer in the next few decades. 
</p>
<p>4. SPECIAL LIFE CYCLE CONCERNS 
</p>
<p>As the previous section pointed out, many patterns of health status vary depending on 
age. Primary health concerns of women of reproductive age often differ from those of 
postmenopausal women. This section discusses first the special health concerns of younger 
women and then those of older women, especially postmenopausal women who are gen-
erally 50 years of age or older. The first section for each stage of the life cycle focuses on 
reproductive-related concerns that are mostly unique to women. The other sections exam-
ine major diseases or health conditions that occur at the specific stage of life. 
</p>
<p>4.1. Health Concerns of Younger Women 
</p>
<p>Some of the special health concerns of younger women are linked with sexuality and 
reproductive roles. These include sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS, and pelvic in-
flammatory disease. Other problems are related to mental health concerns such as eating 
disorders which often start from a psychological concern, but become one of the more 
serious mortality risks for young women. Finally, autoimmune diseases will be discussed. 
</p>
<p>4.1.1. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. One special focus for women compared to men, espe-
</p>
<p>cially younger women, is the link between health status and reproductive functions. Cer-
</p>
<p>tainly fertility control is not a concern only for women nor should it be a responsibility 
</p>
<p>only for women, even though it is usually seen as such because women usually bear the 
</p>
<p>major burden of the consequences of the lack of fertility control. An interesting trend in 
</p>
<p>the United States is that the ratio of abortions to live births has been decreasing in the 
</p>
<p>past decade, while the proportion of births resulting from unintended pregnancies has 
</p>
<p>remained fairly stable (NCHS, 1996). Young women (under 20) have both higher abor-
</p>
<p>tion rates and higher proportions of unintended pregnancies. In 1992, the abortion rate 
</p>
<p>for women 15 to 19 years of age was 52% higher than for women 25 to 34 years of age. 
</p>
<p>During the late 1980s, 72% of all live births to women 15 to 19 resulted from unintended 
</p>
<p>pregnancies, a figure 136% higher than among women in the 25 to 34 year age group. 
</p>
<p>Thus, unintended pregnancies are an important concern for a segment of very young 
</p>
<p>women. They are especially likely to lead to live births for poor women who have less 
</p>
<p>access to abortion and may be members of a racial/ethnic or religious group (such as in some 
</p>
<p>Latina populations) that discourages abortion as a solution to unintended pregnancy. 
</p>
<p>These statistics should not lead to the conclusion that fertility is increasing among 
</p>
<p>U.S. women. Fertility rates have decUned from those of the 1950s and 1960s. There were 
</p>
<p>about 69 births per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 years in 1992 compared to 123 in 1957. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Health Status 467 
</p>
<p>Overall fertility rates were stable during the 1980s. Between 1990 and 1993, the fertility 
rate in the United States declined by 5%. The rate of decline for African-American women 
was nearly twice that for white women. Even for teenagers 15 to 17 and 18 to 19 years of 
age, the ages that have received the most public attention and condemnation for child-
bearing, birth rates have declined on average about 1% per year since 1991 (although 
increases did occur from 1986 to 1991) (NCHS, 1996). Levels of childbearing are closely 
related to social and economic factors. During times of economic and social distress such 
as the Great Depression in the 1930s and World War II in the 1940s, one in five women 
remained childless (Taeuber, 1996). This dropped in the 1950s, but changing social roles 
for women that have increased their opportunities for careers and to engage in many 
activities outside of the home (perhaps along with higher divorce rates) are leading to 
more women remaining childless in the United States. Currently, based on what childless 
women in their 30s report as their expectations, as well as current first-childbearing 
patterns, some 15% to 20% of women will remain childless throughout their lifetimes. 
Many other women are delaying childbearing in the United States and other industrial-
ized nations. In 1993, 44% of women 25 to 29 had not had one live birth, compared with 
only 20% in 1960 (NCHS, 1996). The interaction of class, gender, and ethnicity plays an 
important role in these types of statistics within the Unted States. 
</p>
<p>Issues of fertility rates and reproductive health, while important in the United States, 
are even more important elsewhere in the world, especially in developing countries, which 
traditionally have much higher fertility rates. Increasingly in the policy arena, shifts are 
underway to switch from discussions of fertility control to reproductive health (Lane, 
1994), reflecting experts' frustration with the fragmentation of issues that touch on women's 
health into disparate programs, such as family planning, sexually transmitted diseases 
(STDs), maternal mortality, and child survival. The linkages between reproductive health 
and the topic of STDs and AIDS are quite close. A recent United Nations Conference, the 
decennial International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), concluded 
that the UN needs to focus on six of the most pressing reproductive health concerns: 
gender inequalities, access to contraceptive services, sexually transmitted diseases (in-
cluding HIV infection), maternal mortality, unsafe abortion, and adolescent pregnancy 
(Miller &amp; Rosenfeld, 1996). Several recent articles review these topics in greater detail 
than possible in this chapter, but it is important to recognize the strong links between 
health status and reproductive health, especially for younger women (Lane, 1994; Miller 
&amp; Rosenfeld, 1996). 
</p>
<p>4.1.2. STDs, AIDS. A range of serious health problems for women occur as the result 
</p>
<p>of sexually transmitted diseases. The incidence of the traditional STDs of chlamydia, 
</p>
<p>gonorrhea, and syphilis has been increasing, as has that of pelvic inflammatory disease 
</p>
<p>(FID), although none of these is life threatening. AIDS is the opposite, a disease that at 
</p>
<p>this point is incurable with high death rates. One complication in prevention and treat-
</p>
<p>ment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), as well as AIDS, is moral judgments about 
</p>
<p>those who suffer from these diseases, and this has been true throughout the nineteenth 
</p>
<p>and twentieth centuries (Brandt, 1985). Past campaigns against STDs, and even some 
</p>
<p>current ones, often contain the notion that STDs are a problem only for women of "loose" 
</p>
<p>morals, and that "good" women need protection from the taint of these diseases (Leonardo 
</p>
<p>&amp; Chrisler, 1992). As with AIDS today, stigmatization of the person with the disease 
</p>
<p>often occurs, and reporting by physicians may be less than accurate, especially for pri-
</p>
<p>vate, upper-class patients. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>468 Jennie Jacobs Kronenfeld 
</p>
<p>The United States has been experiencing a resurgence of STDs, partially because of 
the growth of penicillin-resistant strains of the bacterium that causes gonorrhea as well 
as some increases in the rates of teenage sexual activity. Infection rates are higher among 
adolescent girls than boys, perhaps because of contact between adolescent girls and older 
men (Leonardo &amp; Chrisler, 1992). Among African-American women, the incidence of 
gonorrhea is four to five times the national rate (Collins et al., 1994). Also, STDs are 
more easily transferred from males to females than the reverse, and infection in women is 
often asymptomatic and less likely to be identified and treated early. This places women 
at greater risk than men of long-term consequences for these problems. Untreated, STDs 
can impair reproductive capacity. Most seriously in this decade, a person with a history of 
STDs is at greater risk of contracting AIDS through skin irritated by infection (Collins et 
al., 1994). PID is an acute infection of a woman's upper reproductive tract. This infection 
can be transmitted sexually or may result from an overgrowth of normal bacteria. The 
risk of PID is highest for young women, and is sometimes first detected by the presence of 
an ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy growing outside of the uterus) which is life threaten-
ing if not treated promptly (Althaus, 1991). 
</p>
<p>The most serious sexually transmitted disease today is AIDS (acquired immunodefi-
ciency syndrome). While AIDS is a potential threat to all women, large racial and ethnic 
differences occur at present in the United States. In the 12 months ending June 1995, 
non-Hispanic African-American women had nearly 17 times the rate of AIDS as non-
Hispanic white women. Rates were also higher for Hispanic women and American Indian 
women (NCHS, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Despite the general sense in the media that AIDS is a more heavily male problem 
(especially for gay males and those using injected drugs), the gender differential in the 
prevalence of AIDS is decreasing. In 1985, the incidence of AIDS was 13 times higher in 
men than in women, but by the second half of 1994, the number for men was just under 
five times that for women (NCHS, 1996). AIDS now represents the fourth leading cause 
of death for women ages 25 to 44. Younger women (ages 15 to 24) account for most 
(84%) of the cases, with three fourths of the cases occurring among Hispanic and Afri-
can-American women (Update, 1995). The most common suspected modes of transmis-
sion of the disease for women are use of injected drugs and heterosexual contact with an 
infected partner. For women, heterosexual contact is the most rapidly increasing trans-
mission category (Update, 1995). 
</p>
<p>As with other STDs, the stigmatization of those with AIDS is high, both in the 
United States and in developing countries in which AIDS is becoming a more serious 
problem. Many women experience shame and isolation, and this is even truer for those in 
the sex industry where rates of infection are quite high (Abercrombie, 1996). In Third 
World countries, rates of infection are very high in the sex industries and are a major 
health problem for this group of women in countries such as Thailand. In many countries 
in Africa, AIDS is as frequent in women as in men, and has had a major, population level 
impact so that many children are now being raised by grandparents because the parents 
have died from AIDS. In contrast in the United States, AIDS, while a major health prob-
lem, is still more concentrated in certain subgroups of the population. Women with AIDS 
in the United States often face the triple burden of racism, classism, and sexism as AIDS 
is so much more common among poorer and minority women. Many of the preventive 
techniques have not focused on women, and many experts argue that preventive interven-
tions targeted toward women need to become a public health priority (Wingood &amp; 
DiClemente, 1996). </p>

<p>4.1.3. EATING DISORDERS. The eating disorders of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa 
are disproportionately problems of women, and especially of young women. Females are 
at a 10 times greater risk than males, and most at risk are young, white adolescents. A 
distorted body image may lead an adolescent to believe she is seriously overweight when 
she is not. These problems are complicated, and while their origins are behavioral and 
often linked to difficulties in adolescent adjustment, they are exacerbated by the extreme 
emphasis American society places on thinness in women. While the outward manifesta-
tions may seem to be only a more extreme version of the focus on weight control and 
dieting found among many American women, about 9% of anorexic individuals actually 
die from the problem, either from suicide or starvation (Horton, 1992). 
</p>
<p>Bulimia (binge eating followed by vomiting) is more common than anorexia. It of-
ten occurs in late adolescence and a national survey of students estimates that as many as 
4% of eighth and tenth graders are bulimic (Horton, 1992). Physical complications that 
occur include constant sore throat and problems with the stomach and teeth. Even women 
athletes may be bulimic, believing that lowering body fat will increase their athletic per-
formance, especially in sports such as figure skating and gymnastics with more subjective 
judging, in which a slim appearance is an asset (Jacobs, 1994). Fortunately, bulimia has 
a better recovery rate than does anorexia. Both these health problems arise from a 
confluence of concern over gender roles and social pressures of adolescence and the de-
sire to be popular (and thin), but can cause long-lasting and serious health consequences. 
</p>
<p>4.1.4. AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. Autoimmune diseases are much more common among 
women than men. These health problems are conditions in which the body makes anti-
bodies against some of its own parts. Systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheuma-
toid arthritis (RA) are two of the better known examples of these kinds of diseases. Women 
are nine times more likely to develop lupus, and three times more likely to develop RA 
(Horton, 1992). SLE is mostly a disease of younger women, developing often in the 20s 
although sometimes as late as the sixth decade of life. In SLE, parts of the body become 
inflamed, including skin, joints, kidneys, and nervous system. In contrast, RA generally 
develops at a later age, between 35 and 45, and affects joints, especially those of the hand 
(Collins et al., 1994). 
</p>
<p>One serious complication of SLE occurs if a woman is pregnant. The condition can 
be transferred to the fetus, and miscarriage is more common. Often symptoms are exacer-
bated in late pregnancy or after delivery. Treatment of the pregnant woman is also more 
difficult, and this problem is a major source of disability among young women. While the 
multiple roles of a young woman may exacerbate the disease (such as being pregnant and 
trying to work and raise a family), its origins are probably genetic, perhaps exacerbated 
by hormonal factors, which may account for the increased severity following pregnancy. 
</p>
<p>4.2. Health Concerns of Older Women 
</p>
<p>Some of the health concerns of older woman are linked with biological differences be-
</p>
<p>tween men and women and reproductive concerns. This is certainly true for menopause, 
</p>
<p>a biological event with different levels of significance depending upon sociocultural fac-
</p>
<p>tors. The other portions of this section focus upon specific diseases (which menopause is 
</p>
<p>not), many of which are chronic conditions associated with aging and how it differen-
</p>
<p>tially impacts women. The diseases and conditions reviewed are: heart disease and car-</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>diovascular disease (CVD), cancer of various types, diabetes, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's 
</p>
<p>disease. 
</p>
<p>4.2.1. MENOPAUSE. Menopause is one of the more controversial subjects in the area of 
gender and health today. Until this century in the United States, and later in countries 
with worse health status statistics, menopause was not a major concern because most 
women did not spend much of their life postmenopausal. Not until after 1900 did U.S. 
women's life expectancy exceed 50 (Clarke, 1990). To the extent that physicians paid 
much attention to menopause before 1950, it was viewed as a physiological crisis but 
received little specific attention. Negative images of women as they aged existed in the 
general culture as well as among health care professionals. 
</p>
<p>From 1960 forward, the availability of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), also 
called hormone replacement therapy (HRT), has led to fierce debate over its necessity 
(Col et al., 1997; McCrae, 1983). Some feminist researchers employed a medicalization 
framework to argue that, especially within the United States, menopause has been so-
cially constructed by the medical care community as a deficiency disease that can be 
"cured" by medication (McCrae, 1983; McCrae, &amp; Markle, 1984). Medical researchers 
have argued that HRT may increase life expectancy for nearly all postmenopausal women 
and improve the comfort of the transition to menopause for many women (Col et al., 
1997). 
</p>
<p>During the last 10 years, the debate within the medical literature has continued. For 
example, a recent meta-analysis of 31 observational studies found a 50% reduction in 
coronary heart disease risk among current users of estrogen replacement therapy (Stampfer 
&amp; Colditz, 1991), while other studies have reported less clear benefits. Similarly, contro-
versy abounds over the protective effects of estrogen against osteoporosis and the role of 
ERT in increasing the risk of breast cancer, especially for women who already possess 
several other risk factors (Harlow &amp; Ephross, 1995). A 20-year review of the effect of 
estrogen therapy on health status concludes that it decreases risk for coronary artery 
disease and hip fracture, but that long-term therapy increases the risk for endometrial 
cancer and might be associated with a small increase in the risk for breast cancer (Grady 
et al., 1992). A recent article presented a series of decision trees that women and their 
physicians could employ to help make the decision about ERT (Col et al, 1997). This 
article, using a modeling approach that includes incidence rates for diseases such as 
breast cancer, endometrial cancer, heart disease, and hip fracture; as well as assumptions 
about risk factors such as smoking, relatives with diseases, and blood pressure and cho-
lesterol, argues that hormone replacement therapy should increase the life expectancy of 
most postmenopausal women, except those at the greatest risk for breast cancer (Col et 
al., 1977). Clear answers await the completion of ongoing clinical trials, and part of the 
recent debate about the need to include women in more medical studies and to conduct 
studies focusing on special health problems of women have arisen because of the debate 
over ERT. 
</p>
<p>4.2.2. HEART DISEASE AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. This section discusses both 
</p>
<p>coronary heart disease (angina or intermittent heart pains, and heart failure), which ac-
</p>
<p>counts for more than 30% of female deaths, and cerebrovascular disease or CVD (stoke, 
</p>
<p>multiinfarct dementia), which accounts for about 9% of deaths among women. Heart 
</p>
<p>disease in women is largely a postmenopausal phenomenon, with women typically devel-
</p>
<p>oping symptoms 10 or more years later than men do. Illness and death rates from heart </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Health Status 471 
</p>
<p>disease rise rapidly in women after the age of 55 (Lerner &amp; Kannel, 1986). Risk factors 
are similar for men and women, but the first sign of coronary heart disease for men is 
generally a heart attack, whereas for women it is often angina. Women are also more 
likely to die from heart attacks when they do occur (Hendel, 1990). One important issue 
in the literature concerns the fact that women do not appear to respond as well to many of 
the current therapies (Clyne, 1990). Since most of these therapies were initially tested on 
men alone, this finding may be less than surprising. Moreover, there is increasing evi-
dence that women undergo intensive or invasive evaluations and treatments for heart 
disease less frequently than do men with symptoms of similar or lesser severity (Wenger, 
Speroff, &amp; Packard, 1993). 
</p>
<p>Mortality for women from CVD is lower than for men; however important racial 
differences exist. The rate of CVD for African-American women is 80% higher than the 
rate for white women (NCHS, 1996). In addition to being a major cause of death, CVD is 
a major cause of physical and mental disability for women. CVD is very much a disease 
of the old, with almost 90% of the deaths and three quarters of the hospitalizations occur-
ring for those 65 and over. 
</p>
<p>Growing numbers of studies indicate that psychosocial stress and psychosocial fac-
tors are important in coronary heart disease for women. Low social class, low educational 
attainment, the double loads of work and family that women often carry, and lack of 
social support all emerge as risk factors for women in recent reviews (Brezinka &amp; Kittel, 
1995; Elliott, 1995). Psychosocial adjustment in women after a heart attack appears to be 
worse than in men, and return to work rates are also lower. Overall rehabilitation out-
comes are not as good for women, making heart disease quite important in lowering the 
health status of older women. 
</p>
<p>4.2.3. CANCER. Cancer is a name for cells that divide inappropriately, and can occur in 
many different parts of the body. The risk factors for the disease and the complications 
vary by site. Breast cancer and lung cancer are the most commonly occurring cancers in 
women, together responsible for almost half of all cancer deaths in women. Another 
major category of cancers for women are the gynecological ones (cancer of the cervix, 
uterus, and ovaries). Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, accounting for 
32% of all newly diagnosed cases (Kelsey &amp; Bernstein, 1996). Cancer was the leading 
cause of death for women 45 to 64 years of age in 1993 (NCHS, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Lung cancer has been growing in importance as a cause of death for women. Al-
though twice as many men still die of lung cancer as do women, the death rate for men is 
stabilizing, while the death rate for women continues to climb (American Cancer Society, 
1992). Between the early 1970s and the early 1990s, the age-adjusted incidence rate for 
lung cancer for women more than doubled and the age-adjusted death rate rose 182%. 
These increases substantially exceeded those for men in the same time period (NCHS, 
1996). Beginning in 1987, more women died from lung cancer than from breast cancer. 
Proportionate to their numbers in the population, African-American women are more 
likely to have lung cancer. However, because they are even more likely to have breast 
cancer, lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death among white women but 
second among African-American women. 
</p>
<p>The major explanation for the trend of increasing lung cancer deaths among women 
and the time period in which it is now beginning to show up is the length of time it takes 
for lung cancers to develop and the time period during which women began smoking in 
large numbers. Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for lung cancer, accounting for </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>472 Jennie Jacobs Kronenfeld 
</p>
<p>about 85% of all cases (CDC, 1990). Between 1965 and 1990, cigarette smoking de-
creased more among men. In 1965, the age-adjusted prevalence of cigarette smoking for 
people 18 years of age and over was 52% for men and 34% for women. By 1990, the 
comparable figures were 28% for men and 23% for women (NCHS, 1996). Smoking is 
now one of the major preventable health risks of women (Kendrick &amp; Merritt, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Breast cancer rates have been increasing in recent decades, leading to growing fears 
and concern about the disease. It has long been one of the more feared cancers among 
women because of the disfigurement entailed by treatment and the association of breasts 
with sexuality, especially in American culture. In publicity about the disease, the Ameri-
can Cancer Society has used figures of aggregate risk, and these statements of risk have 
increased from 1 in 12 in the 1980s to 1 in 9 women currently who can expect to be 
diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes (American Cancer Society, 1992). Close to 
50,000 U.S. women now die of breast cancer each year. 
</p>
<p>Risk factors include having relatives with the disease, increasing age, never having 
been married, high socioeconomic status, and, for breast cancer diagnosed after age 45, 
being white (Kelsey &amp; Bernstein, 1996; Wooster, Neuhausen, Mangion, et al., 1994). The 
pattern of breast cancer incidence and mortality differs by race. Between 1973 and 1991, 
the number of new cases (incidence) was between 15% and 25% higher for white women 
than for African-American women. Beginning in the 1970s, the age-adjusted death rate 
from breast cancer for African-American women began to exceed that for white women 
and the gap is continuing to widen. Breast cancer mortality was 28% higher for African-
American women in 1993 than it was for white women (NCHS, 1996). The major expla-
nation for this is that earlier detection at a more curable stage is more common for white 
women, who have better access to healthcare. In addition, there is some evidence that 
African-American women develop the disease at an earlier age, and many experts believe 
that the disease in younger women is of a different nature and more difficult to treat 
successfully (Kelsey &amp; Bernstein, 1996). 
</p>
<p>One important controversy is about the use of mammography as an early detection 
method for breast cancer. A related debate is about the usefulness of preventive tech-
niques, such as dietary change and medication. Evidence from randomized trials indi-
cates that screening for breast cancer by mammography reduces mortality in women over 
50. What is much less clear is its usefulness for women under 50. Because of this, the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) has not recommended screening for women 40 to 49, 
although other organizations, such as the American College of Radiology and the Ameri-
can Cancer Society, have (Kelsey &amp; Bernstein, 1996). Because of the growing public 
concern over conflicting recommendations, the NCI changed its recommendations in 
1997, primarily in response to political concerns rather than new scientific evidence. 
</p>
<p>Two large randomized trials are now underway concerning breast cancer, partially 
as a response to the criticism by feminists and the resurgent women's health movement 
that research into diseases that predominantly affect women have been underfunded. The 
Women's Health Initiative is designed to test strategies to reduce the risk for cardiovascu-
lar disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures. It is very large, 
including 63,000 women in one of its studies, mainly because of the large sample needed 
to test the hypothesis that dietary modifications can reduce the incidence of breast cancer. 
The trial of this hypothesis has received criticism, since the evidence is fairly weak that a 
diet high in fat increases the risk for breast cancer (Institute of Medicine, 1993; Kelsey &amp; 
Bernstein, 1996). The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial tests whether tamoxifen, a syn-
thetic, nonsteroidal antiestrogen to breast tissue, is effective in the prevention of breast </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Health Status 473 
</p>
<p>cancer. One controversy surrounding this trial is whether large numbers of healthy women 
should be treated with a potentially toxic drug to prevent a relatively rare event (Kelsey &amp; 
Bernstein, 1996). Results from these two trials will not be available for some while, 
leaving women with difficult decisions to reach about whether to undertake lifestyle changes 
that might have a minor effect on breast cancer risk as well as at what age to undergo 
regular mammography. 
</p>
<p>Of the gynecological cancers, cervical cancer is one of the most detectable and treat-
able, with 5-year survival rates as high as 90% to 100% if the cancer is detected ejirly 
(American Cancer Society, 1992). Because of the advent of the Pap smear test to detect 
cervical cancer, mortality rates have steadily declined in the past 40 years. The number of 
new cases of cervical cancer is still higher for African-American women by one third, 
and the mortality rate is three times as high, owing primarily to problems of obtaining 
adequate healthcare, including regular Pap smears. In contrast, ovarian cancer is more 
common among white women. Ovarian cancer is much harder to detect, and therefore is 
diagnosed at a later stage. Survival rates for this disease are the lowest among the gyne-
cologic cancers, with fewer than 40% surviving 5 years after diagnosis (American Can-
cer Society, 1992). Risk factors are poorly understood, although some evidence suggests 
that oral contraceptives that suppress ovulation may help protect against ovarian cancer 
(Hankinson, Vital-Herne, &amp; Goldstein, 1992). Rates for endometrial cancer (cancer of 
the uterus) have remained stable over the past decade. This disease generally occurs in 
women over 50, with a relatively positive prognosis of 85% survival 5 years after diagno-
sis (American Cancer Society, 1992). Besides age, a history of infertility, failure to ovulate, 
obesity, and use of estrogen therapy are the best known risk factors for endometrial cancer. 
</p>
<p>4.2.4. DIABETES. Diabetes is a serious disease that often leads to disability and can 
even lead to death if not treated or if poorly managed. It is a major cause of death for 
women, ranking seventh recently for white women and fourth for African-American women 
(McBarnette, 1996). The rates are also higher for Mexican-American and American In-
dian women than for white women. Sixty percent of new cases of diabetes are diagnosed 
in women (Tinker, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Although some forms of diabetes begin at a younger age, especially gestational dia-
betes linked with pregnancy, diabetes disproportionately affects older age groups, and 
death is four times more likely for women 65 to 74 than for women 45 to 64 (NCHS, 
1991). It is associated with increased risk for many other chronic health problems and 
complicates the management of many diseases. Diabetes can contribute to kidney dis-
ease, eye disease leading eventually to blindness, peripheral vascular disease that can 
lead to amputation of limbs, and increased risk of death from coronary heart disease and 
stroke (Lerner &amp; Kannel, 1986). Diabetes contributes to the mortality of more than 80,000 
women in the United States, either directly (as an underlying cause of death) or indirectly 
(contributing to another cause of death), a number nearly twice as high as the number of 
women who die from breast cancer even though that disease has received more public and 
media attention recently (Tinker, 1994). 
</p>
<p>A complication for women in successful management of this problem is that lifestyle 
changes are generally required, especially dietary changes. In some cultural groups, women 
may place their own health behind, keeping the family content by continuing to cook 
ethnically accepted foods even if they are not those recommended for control of diabetes 
(Anderson, Blue, &amp; Lau, 1991). Thus gender roles may interact with successful control of 
diabetes, leading to the high rates of deaths from the disease and its complications. </p>

</p>
<p>4.2.5. OSTEOPOROSIS. Osteoporosis has already been discussed briefly as part of the 
debate about whether women should take ERT after menopause. One of the clearest find-
ings of the studies of ERT and menopause is that ERT does help hinder the development 
of osteoporosis, but to do this it must be taken for a long period of time, with recent 
evidence that maximum protection does not occur until after 10 years of therapy (Col et 
al., 1997; Kiel, Felson, Anderson, Wilson, &amp; Moskowitz, 1987). Osteoporosis is a condi-
tion in which the bone density is reduced. If serious enough, fractures can result from 
minor accidents or even normal physical activity in the most severe cases. Osteoporosis is 
more common in women than in men because women are smaller, on average, and have 
less bone mass to begin with. In addition, the loss of bone is accelerated in women by 
menopause and the decline in estrogen levels linked to that event (Collins et al., 1994). 
Some decline in bone mass occurs in much of the population. Current estimates are that 
more than 50% of women over age 45 and 90% of women over 70 have some osteoporo-
sis, making it one of the most common health problems of women as they age. 
</p>
<p>Fractures of the hip, wrist, and vertebrae are among the most common clinical mani-
festations of osteoporosis, but hip fractures are more important for overall health status 
because of their linkage to severe impairment and death (Col et al., 1997; Horton, 1992). 
In one study, 25% of hip fractures required institutionalization and 20% resulted in death 
(Resnick &amp; Greenspan, 1989). From 75% to 80% of hip fractures occur to women. Less 
severe in their overall consequences are vertebral fractures, which often lead to spinal 
deformity, chronic back pain, and the loss of height often noted in elderly women. 
</p>
<p>Risk factors for osteoporosis include being white, being thin, a history of smoking, 
past family history of the disease, and having experienced amenorrhea. More recent stud-
ies support the role of continued physical activity in limiting the impact of osteoporosis 
(Lappe, 1993; Marcus et al., 1992). Some sociocultural factors may exacerbate osteoporosis 
in women, making the gender differences appear larger than they are due to genetics 
alone. Women are more likely to diet to keep weight down to low levels throughout their 
lives and to limit intake of foods rich in calcium as a means of weight control. For the 
current generation of elderly women, exercise was often viewed as unimportant. One 
debate about osteoporosis is whether future generations of women will be at as high a risk 
as their grandmothers, given their greater involvement in sports and exercise both at a 
younger age and throughout their lifetimes, and whether the heightened risk of breast 
cancer and other health problems outweighs the protective effects of ERT for women. 
Another challenge to the medical approach to osteoporosis is raised by some feminists 
who question whether lifelong drug regimens for healthy women are appropriate (Ray, 
1996). 
</p>
<p>4.2.6. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. A health problem of aging women that is less open to 
</p>
<p>debate in terms of medicalization and the need for a feminist and critical examination is 
</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is an illness characterized by a gradual loss of memory 
</p>
<p>and cognitive abilities. By the most advanced stages of the disease, people do not even 
</p>
<p>recognize their own relatives and are unable to live safely by themselves without constant 
</p>
<p>attention. AD has become one of the common reasons why people, especially women, are 
</p>
<p>sent to nursing homes and long-term care facilities. 
</p>
<p>AD increases rapidly in both men and women after the age of 70, but since women 
</p>
<p>live longer than men, many more women develop it. Some studies argue that women have 
</p>
<p>a higher incidence, even taking into account the higher proportion of females among the 
</p>
<p>aged (Schoenberg, Anderson, &amp; Haerer, 1985; Schoenberg, Kokman, &amp; Okazaki, 1987), </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Health Status 475 
</p>
<p>although whether women are at greater risk is not yet resolved. Why people develop AD 
is also not yet clearly known, and therefore attempts at preventive measures to control 
risk factors are not available. History of head trauma, association with heart attacks and 
stroke, and family history are among the risk factors currently discussed by researchers 
(Advisory Panel on Alzheimer's Disease, 1991; Aronson, Ooi, &amp; Morganstern, 1990). 
</p>
<p>5. MENTAL HEALTH STATUS 
</p>
<p>The research on mental health and gender encompasses a huge literature that is quite 
difficult to review in a brief space. This section therefore focuses on only a few issues 
linked to gender and mental health, specifically, variation in rates of mental illness and a 
more detailed examination of depression, one of the most important categories of mental 
illness, especially for women. 
</p>
<p>5.1. RATES OF MENTAL ILLNESS. Important gender differences have been noted in the 
rates of specific mental disorders. Disorders that are predominant in women include clinical 
depression, seasonal affective disorder, the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, eating 
disorders (as already discussed previously under life cycle concerns of younger women), 
panic disorder, phobias, disassociative disorders, borderline personality disorders, and 
suicide attempts. Males predominate in completed suicide, substance abuse, intermittent 
explosive disorder, antisocial personalities, early-onset schizophrenia, autism, learning 
disabilities, and conduct disabilities. A few major categories of mental illness have simi-
lar rates in both men and women including obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophre-
nia, and bipolar disorder (Blumenthal, 1996; Robins, Locke, &amp; Regier, 1992). 
</p>
<p>Depression is the most important of the mental illnesses, especially for women. About 
7% of women in the United States suffer from major depression during their lifetimes, in 
contrast to 2.6% of men (Weissman &amp; Klerman, 1992). Depression is discussed in more 
detail in the next section. 
</p>
<p>Lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders is actually fairly similar for men and 
women; it is the types of mental health problem that vary between them (NCHS, 1996). 
Looking at people aged 15 to 54 years of age, 47% of women and 49% of men had 
experienced a symptom of a psychiatric disorder at some point during their lives. Women 
who report a symptom, however, are more likely to have received some form of mental 
health services for it (55% vs. 42%), reflecting the well-established greater propensity of 
women than men to seek help for problems, especially mental health problems (Gove, 
1984; NCHS, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Many mental disorders are linked with specific stages of life. Eating disorders, for 
example, have been discussed under problems of young women both because they are the 
mental health disorder most likely to lead to death and because that mental health prob-
lem is so strongly associated with one stage of life. Other problems that are strongly 
linked with life stage, at least in their onset, are alcoholism and substance abuse. While 
alcoholism has traditionally been viewed as a problem of men, the rates are increasing 
among women, although across the lifetime this problem affects about 24% of the male 
population versus only 5% of women. Drug abuse is also linked with youth and with men, 
although recent data indicate problems at some point in their lifetime for 41% of men 
versus 32% of women, a much smaller gender difference than is the case for alcoholism </p>
<p/>

<p>476 Jennie Jacobs Kronenfeld 
</p>
<p>(Blumenthal, 1996). Alzheimer's is a disease of the old, and one form of schizophrenia 
typically starts in the early 20s. 
</p>
<p>Many researchers have pointed out that the gender differences in mental illness 
seem to parallel differences in gender roles, especially in American society (Gove, 1984; 
Radloff, 1975). Men display higher rates of disorders linked to violence, such as paranoid 
schizophrenia and antisocial personality disorders. Some researchers have hypothesized 
that these disorders may occur when men become oversocialized to their gender role, and 
see antisocial behavior as a way to display their position in society. This is one reason 
why men are more successful at accomplishing suicide, even though men and women 
attempt it at fairly similar rates. One recent medical sociology text notes that the symp-
toms of antisocial personality disorder parallel expectations within lower class communi-
ties for male behavior (Weitz, 1996). Similar role based explanations exist for the gender-
based differences in depression and are discussed next. 
</p>
<p>5.2. Depression and Gender 
</p>
<p>Some researchers have hypothesized that depression can result from oversocialization to 
a female role (Gove, 1984; Radloff, 1975). One explanation is learned helplessness theory, 
which argues that depression develops when individuals learn that they cannot control 
their lives (Seligman, 1975). Women are socialized differently from men, and perhaps 
especially so beginning with adolescence and differential social reinforcement at that 
stage from parents, friends, and other adults. As women mature, they are more likely to 
believe that their failures and problems in life come from personal deficiencies, resulting 
in feelings of depression. Moreover, women experience more situations in which they are 
unable to control their own fates, especially in the past when women were limited in the 
careers to which they aspired, and this lack of ability to control one's own destiny is also 
linked to the development of depression. 
</p>
<p>Gove (1984) argued that adult roles of men are often more structured or fixed than 
those of women, and that more structured roles lead to better mental health. Also, he 
argues that women are more often placed in nurturant roles, especially within family 
systems, and this imposes a strain on them and leads to poorer mental health. 
</p>
<p>Evidence is also growing that suggests an interaction between biological and psy-
chosocial factors (Blumenthal, 1996). Some gender differences have been observed in 
brain structure and function and in the physiological reaction to stress. Because sex dif-
ferences in depression occur after puberty, this may lend credence to an explanation that 
includes biological as well as social influences. Certain specialized depressions of women 
(e.g., postpartum depression) are linked to hormonal changes connected with pregnancy. 
These biological factors do not work alone, but are combined with the greater role stress 
and nurturing properties expected by women in many different settings. 
</p>
<p>Women in every racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic group have a higher rate of de-
pression than men in the same group. Despite this, overall rates of depression are lower 
for African-American and Hispanic women than for white women. Depression is most 
common among women from 25 to 44, but increasing rates are being reported among 
young women and the elderly. Rates of depression in elderly women have recently been 
estimated to be as high as 20% of the population over 60 (Collins et al., 1994; Horton, 
1992; Kizialy, 1992). Marital separation or divorce is another major risk factor for de-
pression among women (Anthony &amp; Petronis, 1991). </p>

<p>Gender and Health Status 477 
</p>
<p>A last piece of evidence that lends credence to an explanation that intertwines bio-
logical and social factors is information on sex differences in rates of depression cross-
nationally. One study carefully employed similar sampling and diagnostic criteria to col-
lect information about rates of mental illness in the United States, Canada, Germany, and 
New Zealand (Weissman, Bland, Joyce, Newman, Wells, &amp; Wittchen, 1993). Rates of 
major depression were higher in females than in males, whereas rates for bipolar disor-
ders were similar by gender, for all four countries. The mean age at onset by gender also 
did not vary across the nations. One interesting trend noted is that rates of major depres-
sion for males seem to be rising, while rates for females are stabilizing for birth cohorts 
after 1945. Further research will need to follow trends over time to see if these can help to 
untangle the complex interaction between social and biological causes. 
</p>
<p>6. CONCLUDING COMMENTS 
</p>
<p>What can be concluded about gender and health status from the various topics and ar-
ticles reviewed in this chapter? Perhaps the most important point, discussed both at the 
end of the section on life expectancy and mortality and also at the end of the section on 
mental health, is the complex interplay between gender, biology, and other social factors. 
One growing area of interest within medical sociology includes an examination of not 
only gender and its linkages to health status, but also other factors such as ethnicity 
(Anderson et al., 1991; marital status (Preston, 1995), employment status (Stronks, Van 
de Mheen, Van den Bos, &amp; MacKenback, 1995), and social class (Koskinen &amp; Martelin, 
1994; Krieger &amp; Fee, 1994a; Payne, 1991). 
</p>
<p>One area of growing research interest that underscores the complex interactions 
between gender and health in many European countries, as well as in the United States 
arises from the finding that socioeconomic mortality differentials are more pronounced 
among men than women (Koskinen &amp; Martelin, 1994). Traditional health studies of 
socioeconomic mortality differentials have generally focused on men and measured so-
cioeconomic status (SES) in terms of the male head of the household (Haan, Kaplan, &amp; 
Camacho, 1987; Lahelma &amp; Valkonen, 1990; Navarro, 1990). One recent European study 
concluded that, after paying attention to how SES is measured, the major explanation for 
the lower impact of SES on women's mortality combines gender differences in the rela-
tive share of causes of death and the influence of marital status (Koskinen &amp; Martelin, 
1994). This one study of the complexity of linkages between gender and health, and the 
need to consider such other social variables as SES and marital status, illustrates a prom-
ising direction for future research on gender and health. 
</p>
<p>In a recent article critiquing the use of sex and race in studies of health in the United 
States, Krieger and Fee (1994a) pointed out that we need to recognize that many vari-
ables we often think about as biological are actually social (e.g., they argue that race is a 
spurious biological concept) or a mixture of social and biological. Krieger and Fee (1994a, 
1994b) argued that to know a person's sex is to know very little about his or her health 
status or social status. Women, as they note, are a very mixed lot, with gender roles and 
options shaped by history, culture, and deep divisions across class and color lines. While 
recognizing, as do all health studies, the importance and biological nature of reproduc-
tive differences, their article reminds us of the need to realize that gender as a social 
reality often transforms and interacts with biology. </p>

<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 
</p>

</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>Healthcare in society emerges from a system of institutional arrangements and relation-
ships, both formal and informal, that shape and are shaped by socially defined notions 
about women and men. Our analysis examines healthcare organizations, actors, and is-
sues from a perspective in which gender is posited as a central analytic category and, 
more generally, as a fundamental means of social differentiation. While we incorporate 
research on gender differences in health behaviors, we do not intend to present gender as 
primarily a characteristic of individuals. Rather, we strive to locate gender as a socially 
constructed element of social relationships and institutions. Explained or justified on the 
basis of perceived male and female characteristics, gender is an often unequal way of 
distributing social power. Gender is best seen as an organizing principle of culture and a 
basic structural element of society. 
</p>
<p>We conceptualize healthcare organization as gendered in five basic ways following 
Acker (1990): (1) possessing a division of labor based on gender, (2) incorporating sym-
bols and images to support these divisions, (3) hosting interactions that reinforce male 
dominance-female submission patterns, (4) producing gendered identities through orga-
nizational presentations of self (e.g., language and task orientation), and (5) providing 
assumptions and an organizational logic for rules and procedures. Rather than focus on 
these mechanisms sequentially, we weave them throughout our analysis. In healthcare.

<p>gender is perhaps most evident through a highly segregated, clinical division of labor, an 
equally segregated administrative structure, and a formidably complex body of knowl-
edge in which gender-based assumptions, images, and categories are deeply embedded. 
The technical economy of medical care reflects these highly gendered divisions, contrib-
uting to the production of gendered selves and identities, and promoting gender inequali-
ties. Further, the U.S. market economy of healthcare and related state policies reinforce 
gender divisions. In the following analysis, we also aim to reveal how gender intersects 
with race and social class inequalities in healthcare. Defining healthcare broadly to in-
clude the provision of both formal and informal services, we concentrate on the United 
States, although where possible we place our discussion in a comparative context. We 
begin with the rise of the modern era in healthcare in the United States in the latter part 
of the nineteenth century and end with the more ambiguous, postmodern period that 
characterizes the present. 
</p>
<p>2. GENDER AND THE EMERGENCE OF MODERN MEDICINE 
</p>
<p>Healthcare organizations, practices, and policies in advanced industrial nations have de-
veloped in close relationship with the rise of professional medicine (Starr, 1982). Ameri-
can healthcare is a hybrid of medicine and capitalism, both of which have arisen as 
highly gendered activities. Modern medicine in the United States evolved in the mid to 
late 1800s, during a period when the industrial economy was rapidly emerging and cul-
tural ideologies were being transformed by technology, science, mass production, and the 
rise of professional experts. This massive restructuring of the economy triggered the sepa-
ration of production from the home and radically redefined gender roles. The doctrine of 
separate spheres, an ideology that defined public economic, political, and professional 
life as the appropriate arena for men and the private world of home and domestic life as 
the proper place for women, took hold, creating a powerful public-private dichotomy in 
social life (Cott, 1977). With a legacy that is still evident, the concept of separate spheres 
had a profound influence on the healthcare work of men and women as well as on the 
overall organization of healthcare services. 
</p>
<p>2.1. Gender and the Provision of Healthcare 
</p>
<p>The delivery of healthcare is accomplished through a gendered division of labor and 
</p>
<p>stratification system rooted in nineteenth century views of male and female. Physicians, 
</p>
<p>from the time they arrived in America from Europe more than 300 years ago until the 
</p>
<p>past two decades, have been predominantly white and male. They achieved professional 
</p>
<p>dominance within the context of a newly industrialized economy, in which production 
</p>
<p>was separated on the basis of gender and women's activities were confined to the private 
</p>
<p>arena of home, family, and community. Although white men dominated the ranks of 
</p>
<p>those then known as "regular" or allopathic physicians, healthcare in early America was 
</p>
<p>supplied by an array of competing practitioners from all walks of life, including women 
</p>
<p>(Ehrenreich &amp; English, 1973). This variety of healers was integral to frontier survival, 
</p>
<p>where both ideological and structural factors mitigated the dominance of any one group 
</p>
<p>(Starr, 1982). Not only did early American physicians lack scientific medical knowledge, 
</p>
<p>but their potential clients believed strongly in free competition and the self-sufficiency of 
</p>
<p>families in caring for the sick. Moreover, rural isolation and the lack of rapid transporta-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 485 
</p>
<p>transportation and communication made physician consultations difficult to obtain. Do-
mestic medicine was popular and practical, and women were integrally involved in pro-
viding medical therapies and tending to sick family members (Cassady, 1991). Female 
practitioners prevailed in childbirth where midwives attended deliveries and provided 
other forms of basic primary care in many communities. By the 1920s, however, most 
women had been excluded from standard medical practice. 
</p>
<p>The rise to dominance of allopathic physicians conceals a history of gender struggle 
(Morantz-Sanchez, 1985; Walsh, 1977). Evidence dating back to the Middle Ages shows 
that women wanted to study medicine; yet medical education remained primarily a male 
institution. Early American healthcare providers varied greatly in their training and healing 
strategies, with allopathic physicians more likely than others to have been trained abroad 
and to use heroic, interventionist strategies (Starr, 1982). Medical apprenticeship pro-
grams began to mushroom in the United States during the middle and late 1700s. As 
early as the 1830s, there were some American women who apprenticed as physicians 
and, by 1845, women had applied to enter medical school (Walsh, 1977). Some were 
admitted, mostly to the women's medical schools that began to proliferate toward the turn 
of the century, but, for the most part, women were strongly discouraged and systemati-
cally denied entry. Those who managed to become doctors were often barred from prac-
tice opportunities and otherwise marginalized. Periodically, women mounted campaigns 
to change this situation; however, it was not until 1945 that the last of the elite U.S. 
medical schools opened its doors to women, 100 years after the first woman had applied 
there (Walsh, 1977). 
</p>
<p>Physician dominance was achieved at a time when there was firmly embedded sup-
port for racial segregation in American society. This meant that not only women but also, 
for the most part, people of color were excluded from becoming physicians (Hulston, 
1996). In 1910, publication of the Flexner Report, commissioned by the Carnegie Foun-
dation at the request of the American Medical Association, evaluated the quality of medi-
cal education in the United States and recommended the closing of a large number of 
small, inadequate, and poorly funded medical schools, including most of those educating 
women and racial minorities (Starr, 1982; Weitz, 1996). Part of a campaign between 
1905 and 1920 to reform medical education, this report secured and protected the posi-
tion of allopathic physicians, guaranteeing that medicine would remain white and male 
for the next half-century. Disparities in the health status of blacks and whites were docu-
mented by medical researchers during the 19th century, and were used to support the 
notion that blacks were more susceptible to illnesses and thus biologically inferior to 
whites (Williams, 1998). In addition, by the early 1900s, blacks had been barred from 
most medical school training and from internships and residencies in hospitals, except 
for the few with designated "colored wards" (Hart-Brothers, 1994). This situation did not 
change significantly until well into the second half of the 20th century. 
</p>
<p>The creation of the first hospital and the first formal medical school accelerated 
efforts among various groups of doctors to gain control over medical practice. Primarily 
through the discovery of scientific medicine (i.e., the germ theory of disease) and ad-
vances in surgical techniques, the predominantly male allopathic physicians prevailed 
among a host of competing medical practitioners. During the late nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries, allopaths successfully pushed for legal statutes that defined the pa-
rameters of medicine and medical licensure in terms of their own interests (Freidson, 
1988). By the early 1900s, modern medicine had emerged. As the influence and public 
trust associated with physicians increased, the prominence of women in the community </p>
<p/>

<p>486 Mary K. Zimmerman AND Shirley A. Hill 
</p>
<p>as informal healers attenuated to informal caregiving and the gendered division of labor 
in healthcare solidified. 
</p>
<p>Similar patterns of gender exclusion and segregation in medicine have occurred 
throughout the world, with women being barred entrance to medical school, especially to 
elite settings within medicine. There are no examples yet of countries that have achieved 
gender equity in medicine. In extremely sex-segregated societies, women have been al-
lowed to become physicians solely to treat women and children. There is ample evidence 
that the gender-based division of labor in healthcare is an international phenomenon 
(Riska &amp; Wegar, 1993). 
</p>
<p>2.2. Medical Dominance and Gender 
</p>
<p>The term "medical dominance" refers to the power and influence of physicians within the 
healthcare system. It encompasses medicine's attempts to control the conditions of its 
own work, and also the conditions of supporting and competing occupations (Freidson, 
1988; Wolinsky, 1993). While physicians have dominated the medical division of labor, 
they also have been able to control the power relations and influence the professional 
activities of other healthcare occupations. Implicit in these arrangements is the fact that 
medical dominance has also been gender dominance. The divisions and power struggles 
in healthcare typically are discussed as conflicts over resource and professional turf is-
sues with little, if any, attention to the underlying gender dynamics (Riska &amp; Wegar, 
1993). We contend, in contrast, that gender is an essential ingredient of dominance in the 
medical division of labor. 
</p>
<p>Gender has been a fault line in healthcare much as it has been throughout society 
(Doyal, 1995). The dominance of physicians, 80% of whom are male (Barzansky, Jonas, 
&amp; Etzel, 1997), over nurses, midwives, therapists, and technicians is central to the under-
standing of healthcare as a gendered institution. Medicine has circumscribed the au-
tonomy and scope of practice of nursing (Donovan, 1983), midwifery (Weitz &amp; Sullivan, 
1986), and physical therapy, as well as chiropractic (Coulehan, 1985) and other healthcare 
occupations (Wardwell, 1994). The American Medical Association's Committee on Al-
lied Health Education and Accreditation oversees accrediting for some 28 allied health 
occupations, which together are approximately 75% female (Fauser, 1992). Nursing, in 
particular, has been described in terms of the traditional, patriarchal relationship be-
tween husband and wife (Ashley, 1976; Campbell-Heider &amp; Pollock, 1987). The origins 
of this pattern can be traced back to Florence Nightingale's struggle to get nursing legiti-
mated as a respectable and useful occupation in the nineteenth century. Physician en-
dorsement was essential, but she could obtain it only by promising that nurses would 
serve and act only on physicians' orders. Nursing thus was defined as a subordinate part 
of the division of labor surrounding medicine (Freidson, 1988). The growth of non-phy-
sician clinicians (such as physician assistants, nurse midwives, chiropractors, acupunc-
turists, naturopaths, optometrists, podiatrists, nurse anesthetists, and clinical nurse spe-
cialists) is likely to alter physician dominance and, as a result, the gendered division of 
labor in medicine. Non-physician clinician graduates doubled between 1992 and 1997, 
and growth in their supply into the early 21st century will double compared to that of 
physicians (Cooper, Laud, &amp; Dietrich, 1998). At the same time, there is evidence that the 
ability to practice autonomously is increasing for these same practioner groups (Cooper, 
Henderson, &amp; Dietrich, 1998). </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 487 
</p>
<p>2.3. Male Doctors and Female Patients 
</p>
<p>Medical dominance also is linked to gender inequality through the historical significance 
of women as patients and research subjects. In pre-Flexner America, when practitioners 
were competing for prominence, solving women's health problems helped establish allo-
pathic physicians' therapeutic value. With so many types of healers competing, allopaths 
needed to impress the public with positive medical outcomes. They required patients with 
troublesome problems that could be solved effectively enough to enhance medical cred-
ibility. To a large extent, women patients served this function. It is ironic that, although 
elite medical schools at that time barred entrance to most women and persons of color, 
physicians' scientific and technical expertise expanded in large part because of clinical 
access to these very populations (Zimmerman, 1987). 
</p>
<p>Then, as now, sexual and reproductive-related problems yielded eager and poten-
tially enthusiastic patients. Both men and women were targeted as potential patients, 
sometimes by questionable physicians. Medical advice regarding appropriate sexual func-
tioning abounded, for example, warnings about the presumed dire physical and social 
consequences of men's masturbation (Barker-Benfield, 1976). Dr. John Brinkley, a Kan-
sas "physician," offered a cure for male impotence in the 1920s through a procedure in 
which he transplanted goat testicles into hundreds of adult men (Hudson, 1985). 
</p>
<p>Women, however, provided even greater opportunities for physicians to demonstrate 
their professional worth. In the late 1880s, Dr. Marion Sims developed a surgical proce-
dure to repair uterine prolapse, offering relief to hundreds of mostly affluent women. A 
widely respected physician, Sims was able to perfect his procedure by conducting numer-
ous experimental surgeries on slaves and indigent white women (Ehrenreich &amp; English, 
1978). Physicians of this period were sought after to treat another common disorder af-
fecting primarily middle- and upper-class women, a complex of chronic fatigue, depres-
sion, and anxiety symptoms known as neurasthenia or hysteria (Smith-Rosenberg, 1972). 
It was thought that when women's delicate reproductive systems were "overly stimu-
lated" by education or sexuality, both physical and mental health would suffer. Physicians 
treated this disorder with a range of therapies, from total bed rest in semidarkness to 
surgical removal of the clitoris and/or ovaries to complete hysterectomies. Sigmund Freud, 
another well-known physician, also relied mostly on women patients in the development 
of his revolutionary theories of the mind, which served to elevate and legitimate the field 
of psychiatry. It is interesting that physicians and their theories of female frailty over-
looked the contradictory experience of emigrant and working-class women, who were 
able to labor strenuously as factory, field, or domestic workers during the day and again 
as wives and mothers in the evening. 
</p>
<p>Numerous explanations have been offered for the physical and emotional problems 
that appeared to increasingly afflict women in the newly and rapidly industrializing soci-
ety. These include the bodily damage produced by tight corseting and other physical 
restrictions, the effects of drugs and alcohol stemming from unrestricted access to narcot-
ics and patent "medicines," as well as the socioemotional consequences of the upheaval 
in gender roles (Ehrenreich &amp; English, 1978; Smith-Rosenberg &amp; Rosenberg, 1973). 
Whatever the cause, women's health problems clearly were medicine's gain. In turn, the 
new authority of modern medicine served in many ways to reinforce women's depen-
dency and subservient social position. </p>

</p>
<p>2.4. Healthcare as a System of Social Control: The Concept of Medicalization 
</p>
<p>The advice and treatments given to the men and women of the late 1800s and early 1900s 
can be viewed sociologically as mechanisms of social control, complementing and vali-
dating narrowly defined and, for women, repressive social roles. Both medicine as a 
system of knowledge and medical care as a system of social relationships and institutions 
have been studied in terms of their coercive effects (Foucault, 1973, 1975; Zola, 1972). 
These effects include shaping behavior (e.g. sexual practices), identity (e.g. normal or 
abnormal), and self-worth of individuals (e.g. self-confident versus self-conscious). The 
notion of medicine as an institution of social control reinforces Acker's (1990) discussion 
of the impact of gendered organizations on individuals' behavior and life chances. Viewed 
in this way, medicine is an influential social institution, maintaining and perpetuating 
gendered assumptions and patterns of gender difference and inequality in social life. 
</p>
<p>In affluent nations, medical governance over key aspects of individuals' lives is 
expanding (Freidson, 1988). Growth in the scope of medicine, known as "medicalization," 
refers not to scientific discoveries, but rather to the process of defining nonmedical or 
behavioral events as healthcare problems (Conrad, 1992). Women's experiences seem 
particularly prone to medicalization (Riessman, 1983); however, uniquely male prob-
lems, such as impotency and baldness, also have been medicalized in recent years. When 
social phenomena are redefined as medical, medicine responds as it does to any medical 
problem, viewing it as pathological (deviant) or potentially pathological. Applying the 
usual clinical stance, medicine assumes responsibility for eradicating the problem or at 
least bringing it "under control." While the professional entrepreneurship of physicians 
(Freidson, 1988) offers one explanation for medicalization, the economic rewards of new 
treatment markets, in the context of for-profit medicine, provides another. 
</p>
<p>Feminist theorists have written about the medicalization of women's lives, begin-
ning with the displacement of midwives by physicians (Riessman, 1983). They have pointed 
out that whereas midwives assisted women in the delivery of their child, physicians now 
take charge of labor and delivery. The medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth 
(Rothman, 1982) has roots, as we have seen, in the professional jurisdictional disputes of 
the latter 1800s, as does medical authority over menstruation and menopause (Bell, 1987). 
Another struggle over medicalization was the controversy surrounding the official desig-
nation, in 1986, of certain premenstrual symptoms as a mental illness, known since 1994 
as premenstrual dysphoric disorder or PMDD (Figert, 1996). Many women's groups fought 
this decision because it stigmatized a normal characteristic of women. Others welcomed 
it because it legitimated their symptoms as a "real illness" for which they could claim 
access to treatment and insurance benefits. During recent years, yet other aspects of 
women's experience (and in some cases men's) have been medicalized: cosmetic surgery 
and body shaping (Sullivan, 1993), eating problems and exercise (Hesse-Biber, 1996; 
Wolf, 1991) and domestic and other forms of violence. As in the life-threatening prob-
lems created by the diet medication fenfluramine-phentermine (fen-phen) in the mid-
1990s, these seemingly benign procedures may yet prove harmful. 
</p>
<p>Medicalization solidifies medical authority over events and behavior: physician ad-
vice is either required or advised, and physicians are granted authority to determine whether 
the parameters of the event or behavior are "normal" or "pathological." If pathological, 
then physician control extends into treatment&mdash;through drugs, surgery, or some other 
form of technological management&mdash;so that significant aspects of individuals' lives are 
brought under the scope of physician authority. To the extent that women have greater </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 489 
</p>
<p>portions of their lives under medical supervision than men, they are subject to loss of 
autonomy over decisions that may have substantial consequences for them. In seeking to 
improve the quality of their lives, women seeking medical help may end up with lower 
quality instead (Rothman, 1986, 1989). 
</p>
<p>It is difficult to avoid interpreting these developments in the United States from an 
economic perspective. Financial pressures on hospitals and medical practices in an in-
creasingly competitive environment have encouraged newly medicalized areas of 
healthcare. Services such as surgical or pharmaceutical weight control, cosmetic surgery, 
and fitness have become lucrative ventures in many Western countries. Americans re-
portedly spend more than $30 billion in pursuit of weight loss, $43 billion on fitness, and 
millions more on plastic surgery and infertility (Hesse-Biber, 1996). In these areas, women 
in particular stand vulnerable to fraud and overtreatment by medicine. In 1990, for ex-
ample, the Federal Trade Commission settled out-of-court at least four times with infer-
tility clinics that claimed their success rates were substantially higher than they in fact 
were {Modern Healthcare, 1991). 
</p>
<p>Childbirth in the United States is the prototypical example of medicalization and 
marketing. Prospective parents with insurance are enticed by hospitals offering sophisti-
cated technology and extra amenities for what is typically a nonmedical event with an 
increasingly short length of stay. Hospitals want high-volume maternity services to "bond" 
with their customers, especially women, and establish ties that may bring them future 
business. In the 1970s, when insurance payments for complicated surgeries were gener-
ous and the use of technology unrestrained, medicalization of childbirth was manifest in 
an escalating Cesarean delivery rate that rose from 5% in 1970 to 25% of all births in the 
late 1980s (Public Citizen Research Group, 1994). In the 1990s, financial incentives 
shifted under managed care, and Cesarean rates began to decline. In 1992, state rates 
varied between 16% (Colorado) and 28% (Arkansas). Moreover, rates within health systems 
varied to an even greater extent between for-profit systems, on the one hand, and not-for-
profit and public systems, on the other. In one study, Cesarean rates ranged from 12.8% 
in a public system to 28.1% in a for-profit system (Public Citizen Research Group, 1994). 
</p>
<p>The situation in affluent countries, such as the United States, where childbirth is 
relatively safe&mdash;despite issues of medicalization and loss of women's control&mdash;stands in 
sharp contrast to childbirth experiences in developing, less affluent countries where sur-
vival is a key issue (Doyal, 1995). It is important to keep in perspective that the developed 
world's average maternal mortality rate of 26 deaths per 100,000 live births is only a 
fraction of the average rate of 420 in developing nations, or 630 in Africa (Lorber, 1997). 
In the next section, we explore further the implications of capitalism for a gendered 
healthcare system. 
</p>
<p>3. HEALTHCARE IN THE CONTEXT OF CAPITALISM 
AND PATRIARCHY 
</p>
<p>Healthcare itself is embedded in larger processes, socially shaped by government policies 
as well as by broader social forces. Healthcare services, and their implications for men 
and women, differ from country to country; they are defined variably within the appara-
tus of state governments as part of national and international market economies, and also 
by the nature of civil society within households and communities. In the United States 
perhaps more than in any other country, healthcare reflects the combined forces of capi-
talism and patriarchy. </p>

</p>
<p>3.1. Gendered Healthcare and the State 
</p>
<p>Governments can have a profound impact in organizing gender relations as part of how 
they adjudicate the delivery of healthcare services. The relationship between individual 
and state is a fundamental and central issue, specifically the role of the state in providing 
for the basic welfare of citizens. Welfare, in this sense, refers to healthcare as well as to 
education and basic sustenance. Esping-Anderson (1990) has suggested comparing na-
tions based on how well individual citizens are able to obtain basic welfare services out-
side the market&mdash;that is, on their "decommodification" or to what extent welfare will be 
provided if citizens cannot buy the resources they need. His model posits a state-market-
family nexus to differentiate types of national systems wherein each of these three social 
institutions is defined as a potential welfare provider. In the case of healthcare, if the 
market fails and citizens are unable to purchase healthcare, then the state or family has to 
take over. If neither the market nor state can provide, then the individual family is left as 
the sole source of care. A fully decommodified worker presumably would be one for 
whom the state would provide the full scope of welfare support. This scheme has been 
criticized for ignoring gender, the gendered nature of care provision, and for building its 
concept of state-market-family on the experience of male workers rather than on both 
males and females (Hobson, 1990; Orloff, 1993). In the traditional family configuration 
of breadwinner husband-homemaker wife, a male workers' ability to purchase welfare 
services or to be decommodified by the state does not automatically signal that his wife is 
equally well taken care of. The question of how independent women are outside the mar-
ket (their decommodification) remains. Feminist social scientists also have pointed out 
that much standard research on welfare (including healthcare) and the state obscures and 
undervalues the considerable unpaid work, largely done by women, that exists as a key 
element in all healthcare systems (Glazer, 1990; Orloff, 1993). 
</p>
<p>Healthcare services in the United States are commodities, offered either on a fee-for-
service or prepaid (capitated) basis. In Canada and Western Europe, the state plays a 
stronger role than in the United States, which relies primarily on the market and family 
as the means of access to healthcare (Graig, 1993). Since it is the responsibility of indi-
viduals and families to purchase these services, healthcare has become a privilege for 
those who can afford to pay. Unlike many other market commodities, however, in healthcare 
those with the least ability to pay&mdash;women, children, and disabled persons&mdash;are often 
those who need the goods and services most. The United States stands alone among 
industrial and postindustrial, democratic nations in having failed to enact a national 
health insurance plan (Evans, 1997; Steinmo &amp; Watts, 1995). As a result, the existing 
patchwork system mixes public and private services in a way that leaves more than 17% 
of the population, 40.3 million individuals, with no way to pay for healthcare except from 
their own pocket (Fronstin, 1997), and millions more with coverage inadequate to protect 
them against financial ruin in the event of a major illness (Himmelstein &amp; Woolhandler, 
1994). In contrast, most advanced nations consider healthcare as a right of citizenship 
and provide access for the entire society (Anderson, 1997). Despite being by far the most 
expensive healthcare system in the world, fragmentation of healthcare services, ineffi-
ciency, bureaucratic top-heaviness, as well as inequities in quality and access to care have 
become the hallmarks of healthcare in the United States (Evans, 1997). The effects of this 
system are compounded for women both because of their location in the economy and 
because of the gendered nature of medical care. As we shall see, much of the gendering of 
medicine, including the ownership and financing of healthcare facilities, access to health </p>

<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 491 
</p>
<p>insurance, and the use of health services, reflect both the profit-driven economy and the 
gendered, public-private dichotomy that emerged during the nineteenth century. 
</p>
<p>3.2. The Contradictions of Public and Private 
</p>
<p>Healthcare in the United States, for the most part, maintains the ownership and financing 
structure of the white, patriarchal, capitalist world in which early healthcare organiza-
tions and professional relationships developed (Starr, 1982; Stevens, 1989; Steinmo &amp; 
Watts, 1995). Both hospitals and physician practices originated and have functioned pre-
dominantly as privately owned entities, hospitals tending to be not-for-profit and physi-
cians mostly practicing in for-profit arrangements. Accordingly, the healthcare system in 
the United States reflects the same inequalities in gender relations that exist in other 
types of private, corporate settings (Spence, 1994; Wiggins, 1994). The board room and 
highest administrative and clinical positions are occupied overwhelmingly by men, while 
lower-level occupations, such as nursing assistants, clerks, and cleaning staff, are com-
posed mostly of women (Butter, 1985). Men predominate as physicians and women pro-
vide the majority of other types of healthcare, both formal and informal. 
</p>
<p>The gendering of healthcare systems is organized structurally around two types of 
public-private dichotomies. On the one hand, there is the economic distinction between 
public and private, reflecting healthcare ownership and financing accomplished through 
public taxation as opposed to private capital. Publicly financed and private healthcare are 
differentially populated by men and women. Women are more likely than men to be 
employed in the public sector (including publicly funded healthcare), and women are also 
more plentiful than men among those who seek care from public institutions. Public 
versus private can also refer to spheres of activity, corresponding in healthcare to the 
distinction between formal and informal care. In this sense, private means unpaid care 
delivered usually by family or friends in the personal environment of home or commu-
nity. From the standpoint of informal caregiving, the gendered nature of healthcare be-
comes particularly pronounced because of the huge proportion of such services delivered 
by women (Glazer, 1990; Olesen, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Public financing of healthcare and related public administrative and regulatory agen-
cies has grown steadily over the last several decades in the United States, mostly owing to 
the commitment made by the federal government in the 1960s through the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs, extensions of the Social Security system. Because women live longer 
and are poorer than men, the major beneficiaries in both programs are women. Sixty 
percent of U.S. citizens 65 and older are women; 70% of those are 85 and older (U.S. 
Department of Commerce, 1977). Furthermore, the poorest groups in America are women 
over 65 living alone, and women raising children alone, together comprising 70% of all 
people in the United States (Allen &amp; Pifer, 1993). Medicare provides comprehensive 
health insurance benefits and nearly universal coverage to workers and their spouses over 
65. Of the 5% of elderly persons not eligible for Medicare, most are women. Medicaid, on 
a more limited basis, provides healthcare to those with extremely low incomes, with the 
vast majority of benefits going to mothers and children as well as to frail, elderly women 
in long-term care. Twelve and a half percent of the U.S. population received benefits from 
Medicaid in 1995 (U.S. General Accounting Office, July, 1997). Still, since states deter-
mine their own eligibility guidelines, as many as 50% of the poor are not covered by 
Medicaid (DeLew, Greenberg, &amp; Kinchen, 1992). </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>492 Mary K. Zimmerman AND Shirley A. Hill 
</p>
<p>There are other public programs as well that are providing healthcare benefits for 
women, including federal family planning legislation that opened family planning cen-
ters throughout the United States in the 1970s and the WIC (Women, Infants and Chil-
dren) program which stresses proper nutrition during the prenatal period and early child-
hood. In addition, public sector employment typically provides opportunities for minorities 
and women (Higginbotham, 1997) with the prospect of greater gender and racial equity 
than in the private sector. Women are increasingly being covered by public healthcare 
services; however, in the United States, the proportion of the healthcare system that is 
public, approximately 43%, is the lowest among major industrialized nations. Compar-
ing the United States to Europe reveals that countries with a higher proportion of public 
spending for healthcare, in most cases, appear to have better life expectancies for males 
and females and lower maternal mortality rates (Table 22-1). 
</p>
<p>3.3. Gender Differences in Public and Private Health Insurance Coverage 
</p>
<p>Health insurance, whether private or public, must be considered another significantly 
gendered aspect of the healthcare system in the United States. As we have seen, public 
health insurance and related health programs focusing on women are generally increas-
ing. For the majority of Americans, however, employment-based health insurance is the 
primary way of paying for healthcare in the face of rising healthcare costs. During the 
late 1930s, labor unions successfully negotiated with employers for health benefits and an 
employment-based health insurance system emerged. Employment-based health insur-
ance was an especially attractive option for business, as state laws were passed making 
contributions to employee health insurance plans tax deductible for employers (Starr, 
1982; Staples, 1989). Because women had hmited participation in the labor market until 
recent decades, their access to formal healthcare services was often possible only through 
the resources of male family members: 40% of privately insured women were covered as 
dependents even in 1995 (U.S. General Accounting Office, February 1997). As Meyer &amp;

<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 493 
</p>
<p>Pavalko (1996) point out, employment-based health insurance assumes more stability in 
family life and employment than currently exists in America, especially given the eco-
nomic restructuring and the growing number of people who are single, divorced, or wid-
owed (Fronstin &amp; Snider, 1996/97). Moreover, healthcare policies are often devised ei-
ther for women of childrearing age or for the elderly, thus disadvantaging middle-aged 
women who are more often unemployed or single than their younger counterparts (Doress-
Worters, 1996; Keith, 1987; Tallon &amp; Block, 1987). Today, even though more women are 
employed, labor market inequalities still affect healthcare access for many women, as 
well as for minorities. Employment-based health insurance provides men and women 
with differential healthcare access and services, and women's coverage remains inadequate 
compared to men's. 
</p>
<p>Recent erosion in employee benefits means that differential placement in the labor 
market is increasingly important in determining healthcare access for women, as well as 
for minorities. The percentage of the U.S. population with private health insurance dropped 
from 80% to 70% between 1980 and 1995 (U.S. General Accounting Office, July, 1997). 
Escalating healthcare costs in recent decades have caused many employers to reduce the 
healthcare benefits they offer to workers or to increase premiums and out-of-pocket costs, 
pricing lower income workers out of coverage even when it is offered (Cooper &amp; Schone, 
1997). This is a particular problem in lower level jobs and, therefore, disproportionately 
affects women and minority workers who tend to be in such jobs. In addition to declining 
coverage levels and rising out-of-pocket costs, the adequacy of coverage for the depen-
dents of workers has also deteriorated (Fronstin, 1997). Although women's labor force 
participation has increased, compared to men they tend to work in lower positions, for 
less hourly pay, in smaller firms with fewer benefits, with less union representation, and 
more frequently in part-time jobs&mdash;all factors that work against favorable insurance cov-
erage (Lindsey, 1997). Even among full-time employees, men are more likely to have 
employer-paid insurance (68.3% vs. 60.5%). The same discrepancies are found for those 
working part-time (26% of men and 17% of women) and among discontinuous workers 
(Miles &amp; Parker, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Gender differences in insurance coverage are important to explore as yet another 
part of the gendered healthcare system. On the surface, gender statistics on private health 
insurance coverage in the United States suggest only small differences. For example, in 
1993, 73% of women and 74% of men reportedly were covered by private insurance in 
the U.S. (Table 22-2). Recent in-depth analyses, however, suggest that aggregate percent-
ages mask significant discrepancies in how healthcare insurance serves the healthcare 
needs of men and women. Miles &amp; Parker (1997) conclude that in all forms of insur-
ance&mdash;in Medicare and Medicaid as well as in private coverage&mdash;men are served better 
than women in relation to their needs. Men and women have different life spans and

</p>
<p>illness patterns, making their healthcare needs substantially different and requiring ac-
cessibility to different types of healthcare services. For example, a 1998 survey of health 
insurance plans found that 93% excluded infertility treatment while only 15% excluded 
impotency or sterilization on services (Medical Benefits, 1998). Nine percent of privately 
insured women have policies that exclude maternity coverage (Braveman, 1988) while 
27% and 36% of insurance plans do not cover induced abortion (Horton, 1995). All but 
16% of health maintenance organizations cover oral contraceptives, but no more than 31% to 
60% of other plans provide such coverage. 
</p>
<p>Gendered insurance coverage is also important to explore because these biases may 
lower the quality of healthcare for women (Burstin, Lipsitz, &amp; Brennan, 1992). For ex-
ample, women are more likely to move in and out of jobs due to childbirth, making them 
vulnerable to loss of services or higher premiums to cover medical conditions that de-
velop while they are between jobs. Women require preventive screening that is not always 
provided, such as mammograms and Pap tests, as well as birth control and abortion 
services. Because women live longer than men, they are more likely to require nursing 
home services. Associated with living longer, older women have chronic illnesses and 
disability and are, therefore, more likely than men to require adaptive aids, home health 
and community-based services, and out-patient prescriptions. Medicare covers most hos-
pital costs, but provides less adequate coverage for nonhospital care, including the very 
services women need most, such as home healthcare, out-patient medicines, and adaptive 
aids. Among poor elderly in 1986, Medicaid paid 49% of the healthcare expenses of 
unmarried men compared to 33% of the expenses of unmarried women (Allen &amp; Pifer, 
1993). 
</p>
<p>Data on the specifics of healthcare coverage are difficult to find; however, it appears 
that the most generous and unrestrictive healthcare benefits are unevenly distributed by 
both gender and race. Those with the most abundant insurance coverage and the freedom 
to choose nearly any provider tend to be white men in upper-level jobs. Women workers, 
on the other hand, particularly women of color, are likely to be in lower level-jobs that 
provide poor health coverage or none at all. As indicated previously, coverage varies 
greatly with the type of employment. In 1996, only 42.7% of workers in jobs paying $7.00 
or less per hour were offered health insurance compared to 93.4% of workers making 
more than $15.00 (Cooper &amp; Schone, 1997). Clearly, gender differences in the quality of 
insurance coverage is a key aspect of the gendered healthcare system. 
</p>
<p>4. THE GENDERED PROFESSION OF MEDICINE 
</p>
<p>The demands of illness have brought men and women together around the delivery of 
healthcare across both the public and private spheres. This has not, however, accom-
plished or even in most cases promoted gender equality in medical practice. Despite some 
significant changes that have occurred in the past two decades, medicine and medical 
care continue to reproduce aspects of society's gendered and racist past (Abraham, 1993; 
Morantz-Sanchez, 1985; Walsh, 1977). Medical education has been the site of perhaps 
the most dramatic gender changes in medicine. In the world of medical practice, both the 
gender of the physician and the gender of the patient make differences in the dynamics of 
the doctor-patient relationship. The length of medical education prolongs the time it 
takes for changes in gender composition to filter through and have noticeable impact 
among practicing physicians. As the proportion of women physicians increases, however, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 495 
</p>
<p>it is of great interest whether or not their practice styles differ from men's. In the follow-
ing section, we touch upon these issues. 
</p>
<p>4.1. Medical Education 
</p>
<p>For much of last century, medical schools were restricted primarily to white men. As we 
have discussed, strict standards imposed on U.S. medical schools in the early 1900s forced 
many women's medical colleges to close and the remaining elite institutions admitted 
few, if any, women. Admissions of women rarely exceeded 5% until the 1960s. Then, by 
the 1970s, applications began to increase substantially (see Table 22-3), fueled by federal 
civil rights legislation and the enthusiasm created by student activism and the women's 
movement. In 1997, women constituted 43.5% of the entering class of U.S. medical schools 
(Barzansky, Jonas, &amp; Etzel, 1998). Increasing numbers of women medical students brought 
a new gender consciousness which resulted in complaints about gender-based discrimi-
nation and stereotyping among physicians (Boston Women's Health Book Collective, 
1992; Campbell, 1974; Scully &amp; Bart, 1973). Over the same period, medical students 
became more racially and ethnically diverse. One third of the 1997-1998 entering class 
of U.S. medical students came from either African-American, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, or 
Native American backgrounds, with greater numbers of women among the African Ameri-
can students and more men among the Hispanic/Latino and Asian students (see Table 22-
4). Data from 1997-1998 also reveal a decrease in underrepresented minority students 
(African American and Hispanics), a matter of some concern given attacks on affirmative 
action programs (Barzansky, Jonas, &amp; Etzel, 1998). Similar declines occurred for both 
men and women. 
</p>
<p>Gender issues in medical education appear in three major areas: the gender distribu-
tion of students and faculty, the treatment of gender in the curriculum, and the gender 
climate in medical schools and institutions (Zimmerman, 1996). The gender balance of 
students admitted and graduating has improved in recent years, yet imbalance persists in 
residency programs and among faculty as they progress through the professorial ranks 
(Bickel, 1995; Bickel &amp; Ruffin, 1995). About one fourth of U.S. medical school faculties 
are women, with proportionately more women among junior faculty than senior faculty. Full 
professors and top administrators are overwhelmingly men. In 1997, only 7 of the 125 ac-
credited U.S. Medical Schools were headed by women (Barzansky, Jonas, &amp; Etzel, 1998). 
</p>
<p>Medical specialization also is gendered in that women and men are disproportion-

<p>ately represented in most fields of medicine. In 1997, for example, 62% of pediatrics 
residents and 60% of obstetrics-gynecology residents were women, as were 43% of the 
residents in both family practice and psychiatry. On the other hand, men dominated gen-
eral surgery (81%), particularly in specific areas such as orthopedic (93%) and thoracic 
(95%) surgery. Internal medicine had the largest number of residents, approximately one 
third of whom were women (Barzansky, Jonas, &amp; Etzel, 1998). 
</p>
<p>An even more fundamental aspect in the differential treatment of women and men in 
the medical curriculum reflects the way medical specialities are organized. Women's 
healthcare is partitioned between three different specialties: internal medicine, obstet-
rics-gynecology, and family medicine (Bartman &amp; Weiss, 1993; Zimmerman, 1996). In-
ternal medicine physicians, the most common provider of healthcare to adults, rarely 
provide gynecology services themselves. Instead, they typically refer women to an obste-
trician-gynecologist for reproductive-related care. Such fragmentation occurs less fre-
quently for men, whose routine care can be provided by a single, primary care specialist. 
</p>
<p>Medical school curricula have been criticized for focusing on the average white 
male to the neglect of adequate material covering women and men of color (Harrison, 
1990; Lillie-Blanton &amp; Laveist, 1996; Roberts, Kroboth, &amp; Bernier, 1995). In part, this 
reflects a longstanding gender bias in medical research (Kirschstein, 1991; Rosser, 1994) 
compounded&mdash;at least until recently&mdash;by a narrowly defined cultural perspective on gen-
der. Major, federally funded research studies on heart disease, cancer, and other common 
health problems in the United States routinely excluded women until the 1990s. Although 
women constituted a majority of the population over age 65, the Baltimore Longitudinal 
Study of Aging included no women (Weisman, 1998), raising questions about the appro-
priateness of the study report entitled Normal Human Aging (Weisman, 1998). In addi-
tion to bias in research, medical advice transmits clear gender assumptions. Brochures 
and other information on caring for sick children may be written to mothers, not to both 
fathers and mothers. Contraceptive education is often targeted to girls rather than to both 
boys and girls. Medical attitudes and advice frequently assume the traditional "male bread-
winner" family model for the position and roles of men and women, failing to address 
adequately the circumstances and health needs of dual-earner and single-parent families 
as well as gay men and lesbians (Doyal, 1995; Zimmerman, 1987). Biases such as these 
may be particularly difficult to alter because of the nature of medical education, and the 
way knowledge is transmitted. Much of the clinical teaching in medical schools is con-
ducted on a tutorial basis, meaning that faculty supervise and instruct students as they 
work. Standards, attitudes, and values are communicated daily, frequently without con-</p>

</p>
<p>scious attention. Faculty awareness and sensitivity to gender and race in these practice 
settings can have marked impact. 
</p>
<p>Gender and racial bias in medical education also has been associated with the cul-
ture of medical schools and institutions (Grant, 1988), with women and minorities re-
porting more discrimination and harassment than white males (Lorber, 1984; Baldwin, 
Daugherty, &amp; Rowley, 1994; Komaromy, Bindman, Haber, &amp; Sande, 1993). Hostler and 
Gressard (1993) developed a scale to measure gender fairness in the medical school envi-
ronment that they used to survey all University of Virginia Medical School faculty, resi-
dents, and students. They found marked gender differences among both faculty and stu-
dents: in both groups, women's scores indicated gender inequity and sexism while men's 
scores did not. In addition, gender climate is also defined by the policies and programs 
instituted by medical schools, such as maternity and parental leave policies and insurance 
coverage for reproductive care. A 1995 survey of teaching hospitals affiliated with medi-
cal schools found that only 41% offered medical residents paid maternity leave and 23% 
had no written maternity and parental leave policies at all (Philibert &amp; Bickel, 1995). 
</p>
<p>4.2. The Doctor-Patient Relationship 
</p>
<p>Despite dramatic shifts in the gender composition of medical school classes, more than 
three quarters of practicing physicians in the United States are men. This, in combination 
with the fact that women make more medical visits than men (Horton, 1995; Marcus &amp; 
Siegel, 1982; McCaig, 1994), means that the physician-patient relationship remains pre-
dominantly a gendered encounter: a male physician and a female or (slightly less often) a 
male patient. Of central concern is whether this gender skew makes a difference in the 
nature of the interaction between physician and patient and, ultimately, the quality of 
medical care. Women have claimed that male physicians strive to dominate medical en-
counters, failing to listen or to take their complaints seriously (Fisher, 1986; Zimmerman, 
1987). Both male and female patients express a preference for physicians of the same sex 
when discussing issues related to sexuality (Miles, 1991). Difficulties in the doctor-pa-
tient relationship are exacerbated for gay men and lesbians, who may delay seeking care 
as a result. Lesbians frequently do not reveal their sexual orientation to physicians, al-
though this information is considered vital for appropriate healthcare, and often when 
they do physicians are reported to respond negatively (White &amp; Dull, 1997). A recent 
study by Stevens (1996) analyzed several hundred healthcare encounters between a ra-
cially diverse group of lesbians and their physicians. She found that 77% of the encoun-
ters with male physicians were characterized as negative, for example, involved with-
holding information, sexist comments, etc., compared to 44% of the encounters with 
female physicians. While the evidence as a whole is complex and difficult to interpret, 
women primary care physicians appear to be better communicators then men, communi-
cating more emotions, more information, eliciting more patient disclosure, facilitating 
more patient participation and being better and more empathetic listeners (Weisman, 
1998). Women tend to provide more preventive measures and spend more time with 
patients (Lurie, Slater, McGovern, Estrum, Quam, &amp; Margolis, 1993). Women patients' 
encounters with women physicians may be particularly beneficial (Weisman, 1998). Franks 
and Clancy (1993) found the patients with female physicians were less likely than those 
with male physicians to be deficient in breast examinations. Pap tests, and mammograms. 
Lorber (1997) has considered the question of whether there are gender differences in </p>

</p>
<p>"humane" practice style and found mixed results, in part because patients also have 
gendered expectations. Women medical students were found to have stronger attitudes of 
responsibility toward disadvantaged patients (Crandall, Volk, &amp; Loemker, 1993); how-
ever, how these attitudes might translate into actual practice behavior was not investigated. 
</p>
<p>There is also evidence that medical encounters are different for women patients than 
for men. Healthcare researchers have found that men and women who appear to have 
similar health problems are sometimes treated differently. A number of studies indicate 
that women are likely to receive less than adequate care in cardiology (Ayanian &amp; Epstein, 
1991; McLaughlin, Soumerai, &amp; Wilson, 1996), although it is also possible that some 
cardiac procedures may be unnessarily high among men. Coronary heart disease is the 
leading cause of death for both men and women; in fact, since the 1950s the incidence 
has risen for women while declining for men. Still, it is treated less aggressively among 
women, who are less likely than men to undergo standard tests or bypass surgery when 
hospitalized for several different cardiac diagnoses (Ayanian &amp; Epstein, 1991; Maynard, 
1997) even when adjusting for age and severity of illness (lezzoni. Ash, Schwartz, &amp; 
Mackiernan, 1997). Giacomini (1996) found similar gender inequities for heart-related 
as well as for other high-technology procedures, and also fewer procedures for blacks. 
Latinos, and Asians compared to whites. Inadequacy in care may also exist for specifi-
cally female health problems. Citing data from the National Health Interview, Woods 
(1996) found that fewer than half of American women had a Pap smear or professional 
breast exam within the previous year. Black women have the highest rates of death from 
breast cancer, yet the use of mammography is lower for black women, regardless of their 
income, than it is for white women (Avery, 1992; Burack et al., 1983; Burnset et al&bdquo; 1996). 
</p>
<p>Most research on the doctor-patient relationship has focused on communication and 
decision-making with little attention to gender. Both British and U.S. researchers have 
looked indepth at the content of doctor-patient communication, documenting a pattern 
wherein women's complaints are selectively attended to in a context of physician domi-
nance. West (1984) found that women physicians tended to be interrupted more by male 
patients than the reverse in doctor-patient encounters. Phillips and Schneider (1993) 
have recently studied sexual harassment of female doctors and found that 77% reported 
having been sexually harassed at least once in their career. In the majority of these inci-
dents (92%) the perpetrator was male. With women's health activism in the 1970s, more 
public attention was placed on informed consent and an egalitarian relationship between 
a woman and her doctor (Zimmerman, 1987). Nelson (1981) studied these new, informed 
consumers in the context of childbirth experiences. She found that there was little differ-
ence between the well-informed, doctor shoppers among expectant mothers and their 
more traditional counterparts. Both groups had similar birth experiences, including simi-
lar rates of Cesarean sections, episiotomies, etc., even though the informed women had 
attempted to negotiate less intervention with doctors ahead of time.

<p>5. GENDER STRATIFICATION IN HEALTHCARE WORK 
</p>
<p>Healthcare involves the ongoing application of technology and knowledge. This process 
</p>
<p>is an organized effort among multiple practitioners and caregivers, including highly trained 
</p>
<p>professionals as well as family members and friends. It is important that healthcare work 
</p>
<p>refer to the activities of informal as well as formal caregivers. Across the occupational 
</p>
<p>spectrum, the healthcare division of labor is highly gendered (Riska &amp; Wegar, 1993). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 499 
</p>
<p>Gender differences abound among healthcare practitioners, including differences in power 
and autonomy, practice style, and behavior. Some of these differences reflect the different 
clinical roles men and women occupy (Anspach, 1987), and the organizational environ-
ments in which they work (Floge &amp; Merrill, 1986). Other differences have been attrib-
uted to ways in which the backgrounds and experiences of men and women differ (Lorber, 
1997). 
</p>
<p>5.1. Gender and Caregiving 
</p>
<p>Our analysis of the gendered healthcare system has revealed how the state interfaces with 
market and family in the delivery of healthcare services. The growth of the elderly popu-
lation, the development of life-extending medical technologies, and rising healthcare 
expenditures have all contributed to a growing demand for family members to provide 
unpaid caregiving work for chronically ill relatives. Caregivers for disabled persons over 
the age of 50 are fairly equally divided by gender, 56% women and 44% men, although 
women devote significantly more time performing caregiving work, an average of 14.2 
hours per week compared to 7.5 for men (Washington Post, 1994). Despite the seeming 
gender equity in providing healthcare to older persons, studies show that, overall, women 
perform as much as 75% of all caregiving work. Care for sick children, especially those 
with chronic illnesses, is largely the responsibility of women (Glazer, 1990; Hill, 1994; 
Hill &amp; Zimmerman, 1995; Zimmerman, 1993). This informal, unpaid work is required 
by patients and is an essential component of healthcare in all countries. Even so, it is 
often invisible, rarely acknowledged as "real" productive labor in terms of tax relief and 
other forms of compensatory benefits. Unlike social welfare states, such as Sweden, where 
caregivers may receive compensation, the United States recognizes informal caregiving 
as work only under very limited circumstances. Doress-Worters (1996) places the value 
of time spent caring for elderly parents alone at $7 billion annually. Noting that women 
spend about one third of their lives caring for dependents, Hooyman and Gonyea (1995) 
argue that female caregiving embodies (and perpetuates) the most basic cultural ideolo-
gies: that families are natural caregiving institutions and that women are available in the 
home to provide this work. The same cultural ideologies create barriers for men caregivers. 
</p>
<p>Increasingly, there are debates over caregiving and its social implications. Caregiving 
is a form of caring, an act of love and a family responsibility. Yet, it is also a duty, 
obligation, and a service to the public. Furthermore, when state support is limited, family 
caregiving can become a form of social coercion that pulls women (more frequently than 
men) out of paid labor, limiting their life chances and opportunities for social and eco-
nomic advancement. Glazer (1993) uses the term "work transfer" to describe the process 
by which paid medical labor is decommodified and then reassigned to women as unpaid, 
caregiving work. Women are doubly penalized by this work transfer, as it not only de-
creases the amount of paid work available to women (e.g., as nurses, nursing aides, etc.) 
in the healthcare sector, but also increases the amount of unpaid medical work they are 
expected to perform. The stress and burden associated with caregiving work often under-
mines the health of caregivers, increasing their own need for medical care, while increas-
ing the dependency status of women (Glazer, 1993; Hooyman &amp; Gonyea, 1995). As more 
healthcare moves outside institutional boundaries, this raises serious questions about gender 
equity, especially for women as major providers of these services. As discussed earlier, 
feminist theorists have argued that welfare state researchers too often avoid or gloss over </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>500 Mary K. Zimmerman AND Shirley A. Hill 
</p>
<p>the issue of gender stratification. When healthcare provision comes primarily from the 
family, "women/wives/mothers" can replace "family" with little loss in accuracy, and the 
subordinate status of women is reinforced. On the other hand, when the provision of 
these services comes from the state, which takes on the "social mothering tasks," women 
can claim more independence and empowerment. 
</p>
<p>5.2. Occupational Stratification in Healthcare 
</p>
<p>Gender and racial equality within the healthcare system can be viewed within a broad, 
structural context, particularly the advancement opportunities and decision-making au-
thority accorded to women and men of color, and in microbehavioral contexts where the 
focus is on interpersonal communication, cultural sensitivity, and behavioral inclusive-
ness (Floge &amp; Merrill, 1986). Structurally, the hierarchy of healthcare occupations re-
flects the gender and racial stratification systems found in the larger society: those with 
high-level, prestigious healthcareers are primarily white males, with women and racial 
minorities "overrepresented" in low-status, low-paying health occupations. Women now 
constitute 75% of all medical workers and 85% of all hospital workers (Doress-Worters, 
1996), yet they continue to be concentrated in low-paying, sex-segregated sectors of the 
healthcare system. In addition, given the dominance of physicians, female healthcare 
workers rarely have sufficient autonomy or prestige to be considered professionals. 
</p>
<p>The most notable example is nursing, the single largest group of healthcare workers. 
Nursing is highly stratified by both gender and race. More than 90% of practicing nurses 
are women, with white women most likely to be registered nurses or nurse practitioners 
and racial minorities most likely to be nursing aides, orderlies, or attendants (Hart-Broth-
ers, 1994). Manley (1995) notes that black women make up only 7% of RNs, but nearly 
31% of all nursing assistants. Men are increasingly entering the field of nursing: they 
now comprise nearly 10% of all nursing students. Interestingly, while women in nursing 
have struggled for decades to professionalize and upgrade the status of their occupation 
(Manley, 1995), male nurses have been able to gain status in nursing primarily on the 
basis on their gender. Williams (1992) points out that, unlike the "glass ceiling" that 
women encounter in traditionally male occupations, men in nursing often experience a 
"glass escalator:" they are viewed as more authoritative and capable of administrative 
and managerial work. Bias in this case works to the advantage of men. Underrepresented 
in a lower status, female occupation, men are privileged with selective promotion into 
administrative and other upper-level positions. 
</p>
<p>The historically gendered and frequently contentious division of labor between phy-
sicians and nurses (see, e.g., Donovan, 1983) is closely entwined with the struggle of 
women for greater gender equality. Women's battle for greater autonomy in marriage and 
as citizens parallels nursing's efforts to achieve greater professional autonomy. There has 
been a debate as to whether male dominance reflects men's hold on the powerful posi-
tions within organizations or whether it is a consequence of generic masculine character-
istics. The "doctor-nurse game" (Stein, 1967) was suggested as a gendered "script" for 
interaction between (male) doctors and (female) nurses whereby nurses conspired to have 
decision input while maintaining the illusion of physician dominance. The central norm 
was for nurses to fulfill a passive role, avoiding open disagreement with physicians at all 
costs. Nurses' recommendations for care, therefore, had to appear to be ideas initiated by 
physicians. There is disagreement over the degree to which this interaction pattern has </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 501 
</p>
<p>persisted into recent years (Pillitteri &amp; Ackerman, 1993; Stein, Watts, &amp; Howell, 1990). 
Building on the work of Kanter (1977), Floge and Merrill (1986) studied the interaction 
and dynamics in hospitals associated with situations of gender reversal, where there was 
a token female physician or a token male nurse. They found that gender was a more 
powerful predictor of behavior than occupational status. Hierarchical relations perpetuat-
ing racial inequality have also characterized the relations between physicians and lower-
level healthcare workers, where there are higher proportions of minorities. The paternal-
ism shown toward minorities in some medical institutions has given way to more 
bureaucratic policies, with increasing financial competition. 
</p>
<p>A positive, collaborative relationship between physicians and nurses is critical to 
successful healthcare outcomes (Aiken, 1995; Mitchell, Shannon, Cain, &amp; Hegyvary, 
1996). When these relationships are subject to conflicts produced by gender or racial 
inequities, quality of care can be seriously compromised. 
</p>
<p>6. THE USE OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES 
</p>
<p>Medical sociologists have developed several models to explain the use of healthcare ser-
vices. The health belief model, developed by Irwin Rosenstock in 1966, attempts to ex-
plain why people engage in preventive health behaviors or, once diagnosed with an ill-
ness, comply with medical regimens. He saw health behaviors as based on one's belief in 
susceptibility to a serious illness that could be prevented with medical care, and the lack 
of barriers to care. A more gender-focused analysis of the model would reveal how social 
norms and inequities operate to shape perceptions of health and access to care. For ex-
ample, women are typically socialized to be more attentive to bodily symptoms and more 
compliant to medical authority, and to embrace social roles (e.g., homemaking) that may 
facilitate access to physicians. The health belief model, however, has been criticized as 
oppressive to women and people of color because it focuses on the subjective states of 
individuals and embodies a patriarchal world view that centers on predicting and control-
ling behavior (Thomas, 1995). A second widely used model focuses specifically on three 
variables that predict the utilization of medical services: predisposing, enabling, and 
need variables (Andersen, 1995; Anderson &amp; Newman, 1973). Here again, each predic-
tive variable clearly includes sociodemographic factors, such as gender, social class, and 
race, as these factors affect health attitudes and beliefs, access to care, and health status. 
Research has found that the most salient factor in the use of healthcare services is actual 
or perceived need for medical care services, but health status and access to care also affect 
utilization (Rowland, Lyons, Salganicoff, &amp; Long, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Women have long been thought to use health services more frequently than men 
(Macintyre, Hunt, &amp; Sweeting, 1996; Verbrugge, 1985). They make approximately one 
third more physician visits, comprise one fourth more hospital discharges, and spend 
shghtly more time in the hospital than men (Friedman, 1994). Of the 10 most frequently 
performed surgeries, four are procedures limited to women (C-section delivery, total hys-
terectomy, repair of obstetric laceration, and low forceps delivery with episiotomy), while 
only one procedure (transurethral prostatectomy) is limited to men (Healthweek, 1991). 
Recent research indicates that women are more likely than men to have at least one 
mental disorder (43% vs. 33%), with the excess of female morbidity concentrated in 
mood and anxiety disorders (Linzer, Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, Hahn, Brody, &amp; deGruy, 
1996). A closer look reveals that women have higher rates of healthcare seeking than </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>502 Mary K. Zimmerman AND Shirley A. Hill 
</p>
<p>men only in certain age categories, for specific types of problems, and using certain mea-
sures, measured by physician consultations (Tables 22-5 and 22-6). Further, recent data 
indicate that when childbirth is excluded, men use more hospital services than women 
(see Table 22-7). Men also have higher rates of involuntary admission to state, county, 
and veteran psychiatric facilities than women, although the rates of admission to other 
mental healthcare settings are about the same for both sexes (Hurst, 1998). As indicated 
on Tables 22-5 through 22-7, the gender gap in the use of healthcare services tends to 
decline with age. However, because women live an average of 7 years longer than men, 
women represent a disproportionate share of the elderly population and of those residing 
in nursing homes. According to Woods (1996), women age 65 and older are nearly three 
times more likely than their male counterparts to reside in nursing and other personal-
care homes. These institutions in 1985 housed 334,000 men and 983,000 women. In 
many ways, the problems of the elderly are the problems of women, and both are reflected 
in the use of health services. 
</p>
<p>6.1. Explaining Gender Differences in the Use of Healthcare Services 
</p>
<p>Biological factors, socially constructed gender norms, acquired risks, and differential 
exposure to environmental stress all shape gender patterns of sickness and utilization of 
health services. Medicine's traditionally sexist notions about women's bodies, the 
medicalization of normal reproductive functions, and the impact of social factors on physi-
cal health all have made the role of biology in health status and the use of health services 
a highly contested political issue. Still, biological functions, such as pregnancy, child-
birth, menopause, and the longer life spans of women, have traditionally contributed to 
the greater use of medical care services by women than men. Males have higher rates of 
sickness and healthcare use than females from birth to middle childhood; however, as 
Sweeting (1995) has shown, gender reversal occurs around puberty or earlier. Using cross-
national data. Sweeting pointed out that an excess in female morbidity and healthcare use 
emerges between the ages of 7 and 15, as girls start to experience and report more physi-
cal and mental disorders than boys. This gender reversal in patterns of sickness and 
healthcare use. Sweet believes, is the result of children incorporating more gendered 
responses to illness during adolescence, a diminution of female self-esteem, and different 
social expectations and stresses for males and females. This suggests that by the age of

<p>puberty, social factors may start to play as important a role in perceptions of health as 
biology. 
</p>
<p>Gendered activities and patriarchal norms and values clearly shape patterns of 
healthcare utilization, as they help produce specific acquired health risks for men and 
women. Men acquire more health risks from factors such as substance abuse and hazard-
ous work and leisure activities, while the health of women is often impaired by socially 
prescribed gender roles and norms (Waldron, 1995). Being a full-time homemaker, for 
example, has consistently been linked to high rates of physical and mental illness and 
more doctor visits (Avis &amp; McKinlay, 1990; Verbrugge, 1985). While some have argued 
that the homemaking role may simply be more compatible with seeking healthcare (Marcus 
&amp; Siegel, 1982), it is also true that homemakers often experience more distress, isolation.

<p>and devaluation than employed women, and may be overwhelmed by the demands of 
nurturing and caring for others. Employment, however, does not equalize the health risks 
of men and women, as employed married women still perform most of the domestic work 
and frequently hold sex-segregated jobs with low pay and little autonomy, prestige, and 
career mobility. Gender norms in a state of transition lead women to experience strains as 
they renegotiate family work and move into new labor market roles. Charlotte Muller's 
(1986) study of employed men and women found that, overall, occupational quality did 
not affect the use of medical services, and other gender-related factors did. Women had 
more doctor visits than men, but women in occupations that were sex typed for men&mdash; 
perhaps because they were under more scrutiny and thus more stress&mdash;experienced even 
higher rates of utilization of medical services. Stress or role overload may also account 
for her finding that single parents had higher rates of hospitalization than did men and 
women who were married and/or childless. 
</p>
<p>Domestic violence, undergirded by norms supporting male dominance and aggres-
sion, also leads to a higher utilization of medical services by women (Candib, 1995). 
Domestic violence is now recognized as one of the most serious public health issues in 
America, with women of all ages more likely than men to be victimized. More than 4 
million women are assaulted by domestic partners each year, resulting in literally thou-
sands of physician visits and hospital days each year (Gerbert, Johnston, Caspters, Bleecker, 
Woods, &amp; Rosenbaum, 1996). The American Medical Association's Council on Ethical 
and Judicial Affairs (1992) reported that injury to women from battering and rape (most 
often committed by a current or former male partner) accounted for as much as 35% of all 
emergency room visits. Moreover, the rate of physical battering of women increases with 
pregnancy, thus jeopardizing the health of both the women and that of her unborn child. 
Medical professionals, however, rarely identify domestic violence as the cause of prob-
lems, even when the patient has repeatedly sought medical care for similar injuries (Ameri-
can Medical Association Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, 1992; AMA Council on 
Scientific Affairs, 1992). Thus, battered women, many of whom fear retaliation from 
their partners if they report their abuse, view physicians as disinterested or unsympa-
thetic toward their needs (Gerbert et al., 1996). 
</p>
<p>Social factors, especially those linked with gender inequality, contribute significantly 
to the excess in sickness and use of healthcare services by women. Still, women may not 
receive healthcare adequate to meet their needs. As noted earlier, preventive healthcare, 
such as Pap smears and breast exams, are often neglected, and potentially life-threaten-
ing illnesses, such as heart disease, may be treated less aggressively in women (Young &amp; 
Kahana, 1993). Some studies have found that having a regular source of medical care is 
the most important factor associated with receiving preventive health services (Bindman, 
Grumbach, Osmond, Vranizan, &amp; Stewart, 1996; Burns et al., 1996). For women, find-
ing a healthcare setting that is both accessible and equipped to offer a full range of ser-
vices can be difficult. Bartman (1996) found that the majority of women over the age of 
44 prefer a family or general practitioner to an obstetrician-gynecologist. Those who did 
not go to obstetrician-gynecologists received less screening for cervical and breast can-
cer. Similarly, a study of black women between the ages of 18 and 44 living in Chicago 
found that they often had to choose between going to a more geographically accessible, 
office-based physician who offered more limited care, or traveling to a less accessible 
clinic to receive more comprehensive care and better family planning services (Kelley, 
Perloff, Morris, &amp; Liu, 1992). 
</p>
<p>The lack of adequate healthcare and poverty also diminish the quality of healthcare </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 505 
</p>
<p>available to women. The lack of adequate insurance significantly diminishes the likeli-
hood of consulting a physician (Hafner-Eaton, 1993). Women with health insurance also 
experience more gaps in their coverage than do men. As noted in the concept of the 
feminization of poverty, women are overrepresented among the nearly 39 million Ameri-
cans who are poor (Beeghley, 1996). Older women, single mothers, and women of color 
are especially likely to be overrepresented among the poor and near-poor: women repre-
sent 58% of the aged, but 71% of the aged poor, while African-American women consti-
tute 5% of the elderly, but 16% of the elderly poor (Doress-Worters, 1996). Studies have 
consistently found those who are poor have the highest rates of sickness and the greatest 
need for healthcare services (Abraham, 1993; Button, 1986; Krieger &amp; Fee, 1996; Navarro, 
1991; Riessman, 1990). 
</p>
<p>7. CONCEPT OF WOMEN'S HEALTH 
</p>
<p>We have argued that medicine is an institution of social control, regulating gender as well 
as other social relations. Medical knowledge both reflects and reproduces gendered cul-
tural and social structures, and thus serves as a primary social control mechanism. Medi-
cal research and the clinical treatments and advice given to patients form this body of 
knowledge, which, although constructed largely from a male standpoint, is applied to 
both men and women. Women's health and health-related experiences, for the most part, 
have been understood&mdash;whether correctly or not&mdash;through this male perspective. The 
women's health movement was responsible for articulating a critique of these circum-
stances and stimulating social change to remedy them. 
</p>
<p>7.1. Women's Health: Social Movement to Market Segment 
</p>
<p>The concept of women's health as a distinct discipline or subdiscipline within medicine, 
with the potential to define a unique segment of the healthcare delivery system, has de-
veloped recently, roughly since the mid-1980s. The roots of this concept can be traced to 
the women's health movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, when the gendered nature of 
medical knowledge, the doctor-patient relationship, and the entire healthcare system 
came under critical scrutiny in the broader context of political protest and civil rights 
activism for minorities and women (Ruzek, 1978; Zimmerman, 1987). Weisman (1998) 
locates apsects of the women's health movement even earlier in the 19th and early 20th 
centuries. Women's control of their own health and healthcare was the central objective. 
The movement called into question the increasing medicalization of women's lives; the 
narrow, treatment-oriented focus of medical care, relying on intervention and technology 
rather than prevention and self-care; and the hierarchical inequality of medical power 
relations, including the doctor-patient relationship. The women's health movement was 
pivotal in drawing attention to what we now refer to as the gendering of healthcare. It 
created a coherent, consumer-driven critique with specific issues that have since been 
forged into a new agenda for research, for conceptualizing medical knowledge, and for 
organizing healthcare services (Rodwin, 1994). In many ways, the original women's cri-
tique of mainstream healthcare has been co-opted by the healthcare marketplace. While 
the social movement politics have been discarded, there is spreading recognition that 
many health problems of women are unique relative to those of men, and programs are </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>506 Mary K. Zimmerman AND Shirley A. Hill 
</p>
<p>being implemented to increase women's health research and to reform the medical cur-
riculum (Zimmerman, 1996). Out of this critique has come a framework for how women's 
distinctive healthcare needs can be better met. 
</p>
<p>Women's health as a concept was adopted by mainstream healthcare organizations 
in the United States in the 1980s, just at the time competition and market forces were 
becoming prominent. Hospitals were beginning to more aggressively market their ser-
vices in an attempt to secure market share, and to begin reclaiming the area of outpatient 
and ambulatory services that they gave up in the early part of this century. A healthcare 
consultant, based in Chicago, developed the concept of hospital-based Women's Health 
Centers in the mid-1980s (Thomas, forthcoming). While presented as improved quality 
of care for women, the centers frequently provided little more than a repackaging of 
existing obstetrics-gynecology and diagnostic screening services. The concept of arrang-
ing services in this way was sold to hospital boards using the idea that women make 
healthcare decisions for the entire family. If women preferred a specific hospital or clinic, 
it was thought that the entire family would become clients. According to estimates, in 
1993 some 3,600 women's health centers were in operation, the majority sponsored by 
hospitals (Weisman, 1998). 
</p>
<p>The initial Women's Health Center model incorporated movement principles, such 
as more decision-making control for the patient, more quality time in the doctor-patient 
relationship, and women physicians. Many centers, however, were unable to move be-
yond the library and health education programs they featured, and never provided actual 
medical services. Those that did had to secure established medical practices whose part-
nership with the hospital did not threaten previously established medical staff relations. 
The very medical practices that were needed to make the Women's Health Centers success-
ful&mdash;those that were financially stable with a sizable patient load&mdash;were the most Ukely to 
threaten existing physicians and generate conflict. Inevitably, for financial and internal po-
litical reasons, the innovative aspects of Women's Centers in many hospitals were phased 
out, leaving standard services, such as maternity and gynecology, renamed as women's 
healthcare. By the mid-1990s, the promise of a fundamental shift in the philosophy and 
organization of private sector healthcare for women had largely disappeared. 
</p>
<p>7.2. Women's Health as a National Initiative 
</p>
<p>While the private side of the healthcare system in the United States lost currency in the 
</p>
<p>change-oriented agenda of the women's health movement, the public sector did not. The 
</p>
<p>1990s saw the longstanding criticisms of the United States' biomedical research estab-
</p>
<p>lishment and its history of gender bias result in significant social change. After years of 
</p>
<p>pressure, culminating in several task forces and their reports, in 1990 the National Insti-
</p>
<p>tutes of Health established an Office of Research on Women's Health, and in 1991 a 
</p>
<p>federal Office of Women's Health was established within the U.S. Department of Health 
</p>
<p>and Human Services (Narrigan, Jones, Worcester, &amp; Grad, 1997). In addition, in 1991 
</p>
<p>the NIH launched a Women's Health Initiative to study three diseases that are leading 
</p>
<p>causes of death in women: cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. During this 
</p>
<p>same period, national medical organizations also mounted significant efforts to reform 
</p>
<p>curricula and develop medical school programs to enhance gender equity (Zimmerman, 
</p>
<p>1996). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 507 
</p>
<p>It is too early to evaluate the impact of these developments. Nonetheless, they repre-
sent a recognition by the U.S. government of the gender bias and inequities in medical 
research and practice (Auerbach &amp; Figert, 1995). It also is clear that they represent a 
federal mandate to address these problems. Women's health as a concept has begun to be 
integrated into standard practices of medical research and medical education, a process 
that will result in further changes and eventually alter the gendered nature of healthcare. 
</p>
<p>8. HEALTHCARE REFORM 
</p>
<p>Providing health services within the framework of the capitalist economy of the United 
States has led to escalating medical expenditures and an erosion of healthcare services to 
all but the most affluent. Dissatisfaction with the inefficiency, inequity, and cost of 
healthcare paved the way for healthcare reform, beginning with the gradual implementa-
tion of cost-cutting strategies in the 1980s. Prior to 1983, hospitals and physicians were 
reimbursed by insurance for the "reasonable and customary" costs of medical treatment. 
Owing to escalating costs, the government's Medicare program began to pay hospitals a 
preestablished sum based on the patient's diagnosis-related group, or DRG. These new 
arrangements placed more financial risk on healthcare providers, with the goal of elimi-
nating unnecessary treatment and encouraging efficient, cost-effective care. By the late 
1990s, a patchwork of regulations had evolved to regulate the excesses of the market-
place, and there was a pronounced social shift toward the notion of individuals being 
responsible for avoiding sickness through healthy lifestyles. In examining these trends, 
Clancy and Massion (1992) concluded that the pronounced capitalist and entrepreneurial 
activity in healthcare in the United States had resulted in significant gender inequities in 
healthcare quality to the particular disadvantage of women. 
</p>
<p>8.1. The Gender Implications of Managed Care 
</p>
<p>Managing healthcare resources efficiently in relation to the processes and outcomes of 
care has become a prominent idea in American healthcare policy and the focus of health 
reform. Notoriously difficult to define, managed care refers to a variety of organizational 
and financial arrangements designed to eliminate unnecessary and inappropriate 
healthcare, reduce costs, and increase efficiency (Congressional Budget Office, 1992). 
There is a broad array of managed care initiatives, such as DRG-based reimbursement, 
mandated second opinions, medical practice guidelines, and health maintenance organi-
zations (HMOs), which themselves vary widely from tightly structured group and staff 
models to looser, independent practice associations (IPAs). By the end of the 1990s, man-
aged care covered a large segment of Americans, both privately and publicly insured and 
including Medicare and Medicaid. Women were approximately 53% of all enrollees in 
1993 (Weisman, 1998). Publicly funded managed care particularly affected women, since 
they are disproportionately represented among the poor, disabled, and elderly. In 1997, 
Medicaid in nearly every state delivered services on a managed care model. Private insurance 
for middle- and lower-level employees also reUes heavily on managed care plans. Most 
women in the labor market are employed at these levels. 
</p>
<p>Managed care has significantly different implications for men and women </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>508 Mary K. Zimmerman AND Shirley A. Hill 
</p>
<p>(Zimmerman &amp; Hill, 1999). Four features of managed care provide insights into how 
men and women are affected differently. First, managed care, compared to other care 
arrangements, provides more prevention and early intervention services (Miller &amp; Luft, 
1994). A 1993 survey found that women in HMOs received more screening tests for early 
detection of disease, such as clinical breast examination, mammography, pelvic examina-
tions, and Pap tests, than insured women not in HMOs (Alan Guttmacher Institute, 1994; 
Louis Harris &amp; Associates, 1993; Makuc, Freid, &amp; Parsons, 1994). Further, HMOs are 
substantially more likely to cover all types of reversible contraception than other forms of 
health insurance (Alan Guttmacher Institute, 1994). For example, 81% of HMOs covered 
diaphragm fittings whereas only 21% of conventional plans did so. The increased access 
provided to women, combined with the long-established finding that women are more 
likely to engage in preventive health practices than are men (Miles, 1991), seem to sug-
gest that managed care will enhance preventive care among women. The effects for men 
are less clear. While research suggests that men are less oriented to prevention, much also 
depends on the extent to which HMOs and other managed care organizations emphasize 
screening and encourage prevention practices appropriate for men. 
</p>
<p>A second feature that may result in differential effects for men and women is that 
managed care commonly relies on primary care. Primary care typically is more compli-
cated for women than for men because women often have multiple physicians for their 
regular source of care while men require only one. Women often receive gynecological 
care from obstetrician-gynecologists and general care from internists or family practitio-
ners (Bartman, 1996). As of 1994, 70% of HMO plans in the United States allowed 
women to self-refer to an obstetrician-gynecologist other than their primary care pro-
vider, but half of these plans limited the visits to one per year (Bernstein, 1996). Managed 
care organizations that require women to choose a single primary care provider may, in 
so doing, be putting women at increased risk of inadequate prevention and monitoring 
for key women's health problems (Johns, 1994). Multiple providers are not consistent 
with the efficiency concepts of managed care, so over the long term, women's healthcare 
may need to be reorganized to be efficient. 
</p>
<p>The third issue in managed care concerns restrictions on services. Available data 
show that HMO members have lower hospital admission rates, shorter hospital length of 
stay, and less use of expensive procedures and tests (Bernstein, 1996). This becomes a 
gender issue because women are disproportionally more likely to use these services owing 
to childbirth and age. There is particular concern over whether managed care can suc-
cessfully manage the disabled and chronically ill, groups also disproportionally com-
posed of women. Mental health services and their coverage under managed care, espe-
cially depression, may also be a special problem for women. 
</p>
<p>The fourth feature with implications for gender is the managed care practice of 
restricting access to physicians and other providers. Consumer choice has become a cen-
tral issue in American healthcare reform. Moreover, being able to maintain continuity of 
care with the same physician, or physicians who work closely with each other, promotes 
positive health outcomes. Being able to choose one's physician or hospital is a particu-
larly prominent concern in managed care plans where choice can be severely limited. 
Because more women than men receive health coverage in heavily managed plans, hav-
ing access to the providers one chooses is another gendered issue that disadvantages 
women. The potential problems related to women's lack of choice are compounded be-
cause women need and use healthcare services more frequently than men, and because, as </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 509 
</p>
<p>has been discussed, their routine healthcare is divided among multiple providers. Indi-
viduals who have a usual source of care also have better healthcare access and a higher 
likelihood of receiving needed medical services. Between 1987 and 1992, the estimated 
proportion of adult Americans with no usual source of care rose from 17% to 21% (Moy, 
Bartman, Clancy, &amp; Cornelius, 1998). This raises additional concerns about the effects of 
managed care, which significantly expanded during the same time period. 
</p>
<p>8.2. Individual Responsibility for Siclcness and Health 
</p>
<p>A second force for change in the healthcare system is the focus on personal responsibility 
for health. Social theorists have analyzed this trend as part of a broader cultural shift 
from modernism to postmodernism. In healthcare, this transition signifies a move away 
from the positivism of biomedicine to a more eclectic model of health and illness with 
greater awareness of the body and personal responsibility for it (see Hall, 1998). Prior to 
the modern era, disease was feared, but accepted as outside humans' ability to govern or 
control. During the rise of medicine in the modern era, disease was seen as part of the 
human struggle against nature, a challenge to be conquered. Science was viewed optimis-
tically as the ultimate weapon in the war against disease. In the last half of the twentieth 
century, however, social awareness about the limits of scientific medicine and skepticism 
of the biomedical model of disease, along with the political-economic difficulties of dis-
tributing healthcare resources, encouraged yet another shift in cultural thinking about 
disease. As the role of individuals in the etiology of diseases began to reemerge, people 
began to be seen as contributing to&mdash;even responsible for&mdash;their own illness (Hall, 1998). 
Disease, within this framework, could more easily be viewed as a person's own fault. Lifestyles 
and behavioral risk factors in chronic diseases received increased attention, with government 
sponsorship in the 1970s and 1980s emphasizing the effects of diet, exercise, smoking, and 
stress on heart disease and cancer. The implications of this approach could be viewed 
alternatively as either heightened accountability or "blaming the victim." 
</p>
<p>The gender question in this shift to greater personal responsibility is whether its 
consequences differ for men and women. Miles (1991) argued that women are more eas-
ily placed in the sick role than men. As personal accountability increases, this suggests 
that women also will be more likely to be blamed for illness. The theory of the sick role 
(Parsons, 1951) holds that sick individuals are exempted from normal social roles and 
from responsibility for their illness, provided they demonstrate the desire to get well. For 
Parsons, the sick role allows society to differentiate the "sick" from the "bad," a distinc-
tion that is blurred when individuals are seen as causing their own illnesses by either 
engaging in risky behaviors or failing to engage in healthy ones. Holding individuals 
responsible for illness contradicts the Parsonian sick role, and opens the possibility that 
those who are blamed will be subjected to further negative sanctions. Parsons did not 
offer a gendered perspective on the sick role; however, if the sick role is more readily 
occupied by women, then they might, in turn, be more readily blamed for their illnesses 
than men. This is particularly ominous if punishment follows blame&mdash;for example, if 
health benefits were disproportionately denied to women because they are perceived to 
have contributed to or "caused" their own illness (for additional discussion, see Doyal, 
1995; Miles, 1991). 
</p>
<p>Taking personal responsibility for health can also be viewed from the standpoint of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>510 Mary K. Zimmerman AND Shirley A. Hill 
</p>
<p>participating in self-care. Men have been found to be more stoic in responding to symp-
toms and therefore less likely to take corrective actions, while women are thought to pay 
greater attention to their bodies and to monitoring health signs and symptoms (Mechanic, 
1968). To the extent that personal responsibility encourages more self-care, these gender 
differences may become more significant. Self-care is consistent with the principles of 
the women's health movement in that it represents individuals taking more control over 
their bodies and lives. Women, therefore, may be prone to adopt self-care while men 
would do so less, depending instead on women. Increasing self-care, on the other hand, 
focuses attention on health as a product of what men and women do as individuals, rather 
than on what their environment and society does to them sometimes without their knowl-
edge, that is, unsafe conditions and toxic exposures through food, water, air, job and 
travel safety, etc. Self-care can be a way to deflect attention away from the deficiencies of 
the healthcare system, including restricted access to care, and can lead to inadequate 
supervision of both men's and women's healthcare needs. 
</p>
<p>9. CONCLUSIONS: QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE 
</p>
<p>Analyzing healthcare as a gendered institution has revealed significant differences in 
healthcare systems on the basis of gender, and has suggested even more complex differ-
entiation when race, social class, and sexual orientation are taken into account. We have 
argued that gender is a fundamental way of organizing social life, deeply embedded within 
the social fabric of society. Consistent with this assertion, we have emphasized gender as 
a characteristic of organizations rather than solely an individual variable. Healthcare is 
gendered because men and women occupy different positions within the system, both as 
patients and providers. Moreover, these differences are such that, often, women are dis-
advantaged. Women, compared to men, have more illnesses and use more healthcare 
services, are more likely to have their behaviors medicalized, and are less likely to receive 
aggressive medical intervention for life-threatening illnesses. As workers, they are more 
likely to be concentrated in the lower echelons of the healthcare system or, in the case of 
unpaid workers, to have their labor ignored altogether. We have analyzed gender within 
the context of macro-level forces such as patriarchy, capitalism, industrialization, and the 
doctrine of separate spheres for men and women. These forces fostered the ability of 
white male physicians to achieve medical dominance and construct gender norms that 
stereotype women and marginalize their roles in medicine. The result has been a gendering 
of medical knowledge, access to medical education, the organization of healthcare work, 
and the doctor-patient relationship. Despite some notable gains by women since the 1970s, 
recent healthcare developments, masked as healthcare reforms, have often served to 
strengthen and perpetuate the gendering of healthcare. The relegation of unpaid caregiving 
work to women is a prime example. 
</p>
<p>Ultimately, healthcare quality is the central issue for both women and men. While 
the defects and excesses of American healthcare affect both men and women, the conse-
quences are not the same. Women and men occupy different places in social life, and are 
regarded differently in cultural attitudes and values. Furthermore, in the evolution of 
healthcare, male dominance has positioned women as "the other," adding to their vulner-
ability in this type of gendered healthcare system. We have argued that the quality of 
healthcare available to women has been and still is undermined by patriarchy and capital-
ism. Women have been primarily patients and (until recently) rarely physicians. The </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Health Care as a Gendered System 511 
</p>
<p>perspective of white men has been the basis for medical education which, until the last 
few years, has been rife with erroneous and stereotypically gendered information. More 
recently, this bias has served as a rallying point for consumers and groups within the 
women's health movement. The quality of healthcare given to women has been shaped by 
the gendering of the doctor-patient relationship, which has placed women in a subordi-
nate and dependent position. During and following industrialization, women became the 
primary clientele for physicians and the unwitting victims of allopathic medicine's ef-
forts to prove its efficacy; yet, in the modern era, women are often excluded from system-
atic medical research. 
</p>
<p>The medicalization of common female experiences, such as pregnancy, childbirth, 
and menopause, as well as the more recent emphasis on cosmetic surgery, eating disor-
ders, and fitness, has extended medical control over the lives of women. Yet, while women 
are often overtreated for problems that are only questionably medical in nature, there is 
growing evidence that they may be undertreated for serious health problems, such as 
coronary heart disease. Narrow views of gender roles, such as the well-documented ten-
dency in medicine to think of women's health problems first in relation to the reproduc-
tive system, may in part explain these inequities in medical practice. Stereotypes have 
been cited by minorities, as well as by gays and lesbians, as discouraging their use of 
medical care with the potential of compromising their health. Limited access to healthcare 
is also a quality of care issue of special concern to women. Health insurance historically 
been linked to employment at the same time socially prescribed roles for women pre-
cluded employment. Thus, women have been more likely than men to be insured as de-
pendent spouses and, with the recent entry of women into the labor market, to hold posi-
tions that lack health insurance. As we have shown, women are overrepresented among 
the poor and among those likely to receive their healthcare in the public sector of the 
healthcare system. 
</p>
<p>Despite continuing gender inequities in healthcare, our analysis has revealed sig-
nificant challenge to the patriarchal nature of medicine. Women have historically fought 
for the right to acquire a medical education and to practice medicine, a cause that now 
has support from both men and women within the medical leadership. In the past 25 
years, women have made notable gains in terms of entry into medical schools, challeng-
ing the sexism of the medical curricula and sexual harassment in medical schools. The 
evidence so far suggests that, as physicians, women add desirable and complementary 
attributes to the doctor-patient relationship. Perhaps most significantly, the women's 
health movement has provided a patient-oriented critique of healthcare, enhancing the 
gender consciousness of many women, creating a sense of consumer choice, and empow-
ering both men and women to seek a greater voice in healthcare decisions. If the goal for 
the future is continued improvement of healthcare, then consumers must continue to be 
vigilant lest new health reforms repeat and reinforce the inequities of the past.

<p>9.1. Future Research 
</p>
<p>There are important questions and issues for researchers to explore in each section of this 
chapter. After years of domination, the biomedical model's hold over medical thinking 
appears to be weakening and the positivistic notion of medicine's scientific objectivity 
can now be more easily challenged. There are vast, new opportunities to understand 
healthcare as a social system where attitudes, values, and ideologies play a role. Gender </p>

</p>
<p>study in relation to health and medicine has been particularly slow to develop; yet, look-
ing at gender as an organizational phenomenon holds particular promise as a new way to 
understand healthcare as well as to analyze processes of social inequality. 
</p>
<p>Three areas are especially important for future research. First, we need to better 
understand and untangle the way culturally based stereotypes about gender confound 
medical diagnoses and treatment decisions. This should help to establish the valid 
healthcare needs of men and women and to clarify issues of overtreatment and 
undertreatment. Next, more research is needed on the organization of healthcare&mdash;the 
policy arrangements set by insurance schemes (public as well as private) and the ways 
professional and institutional providers organize services around these policies&mdash;in terms 
of the differential social and health impacts for men and women. This includes studying 
informal caregiving in relation to broader institutional policies and practices, keeping in 
mind that both public and private organizational arrangements can structure the lives of 
men and women differently by influencing the need for family caregiving. Finally, it is essen-
tial for researchers to devote greater attention to the social conditions under which variation 
occurs in gendered healthcare. Male and female are master categories that, despite their 
analytic significance, dissolve into a multiplicity of subpatterns when additional factors 
are considered. While the feminist critique of the healthcare system has often focused too 
narrowly on middle-class white women, studies of racial inequities in healthcare and 
health status have tended to overlook the issues of gender entirely (see, for example, 
Williams, 1998). Specifically, future research should systematically consider class and race 
differences to more fully explore the complexities of healthcare as a gendered system.

<p>Gender and Politics 
</p>
<p>ELIZABETH M . ESTERCHILD 
</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>The trickle of research on gender and poHtics that existed prior to the emergence of the 
contemporary women's movement became a veritable flood in the last few decades. While 
much of the literature is published in dedicated journals such as Women's Political Quar-
terly or Journal of Women and Politics some has made inroads in general political sci-
ence journals, and pertinent articles occasionally appear in other social science venues as 
well. The issues and questions addressed cover a large terrain from political socialization 
in childhood, through gender differences in all types of political behavior and election to 
political office, to acceptance and behavior of women in public office. Especially in re-
gard to the "gender gap" in political attitudes and behavior, the research mainly ad-
dresses differences that stem from differential socialization and from the varied roles that 
women and men enact. There is little attempt to treat gender as more than a characteristic 
of individuals; instead it is little more than a demographic characteristic similar to age, 
education, and income. Rarely are women and men seen as engaged in sets of social 
relationships that are at least partly structured by differential access to power. In brief the 
authors do not use a distinction between '"gender as difference' (between men/masculin-
ity and women/femininity) and 'gender-as-power,' which promotes gender-differentiated 
categories based on power relations" (Peterson, 1995). 
</p>
<p>The same tendencies are apparent in the myriad studies of election processes and 
outcomes. Profiles of political candidates show how, historically, women differed appre-
ciably from their male counterparts: they were less often married, less likely to have 
young children still at home, and less often in the labor force. If they had been working

</p>
<p>for pay, they were highly likely to be employed in one of the traditional female 
semiprofessions such as nursing or teaching. Women candidates more often brought a 
history of involvement in voluntary and nonpolitical organizations to the campaigns while 
men more often brought a history of involvement in political parties and had more often 
held a lower level political office. Today, women resemble men candidates much more. 
Having gained labor force and political experience, more women now run for office and 
more women win. Again, gender is treated as traits or characteristics of people, not as an 
analytic category rooted in power relations. 
</p>
<p>Insightful as this massive literature is, it does not serve to predict future develop-
ments very well because it is not strongly grounded in a well-developed theory of either 
political structure or gender stratification. Nor is there much attempt to theorize the poli-
tics of gender differences, that is, little theory is developed in an effort to explain why 
women and men behave differently in the political arena. Men, and especially white men, 
are taken-for-granted actors in the political arena. Yet no one has taken on the task of 
discovering how this fact might affect the everyday behavior of men, or how expectations 
associated with men's roles in society might condition their behavior as politicians. In-
stead, men are "normal" in politics; studying gender often means studying women only 
or studying their differences from men. Finally, little concern is voiced over the represen-
tation of minority women in political office. While the Center for the American Woman 
and Politics (CAWP) faithfully reports the numbers of black women elected to Congress 
and state legislatures, evidently these are too few to merit much systematic attention. 
Some research (e.g., Wilcox, 1990) reports attitudes of women and men separately and 
attitudes of blacks and whites separately and a review (Githens, 1995) of appointments to 
the federal judiciary shows how women and blacks are viewed differently by members of 
selection committees. However, this work has not advanced to striving to understand the 
intersection of race and gender either in the political system or among individuals. 
</p>
<p>Despite the limitations, there is ample material to fuel the sociologist's interest in 
understanding the position of women, the relative power of women and men, and other 
aspects of gender stratification in the political arena. There is so much literature that this 
chapter covers only a few major topics: (1) the gender gap in political attitudes and voting 
behavior, (2) patterns of election of women and men to public office, and (3) gender 
differences in the behavior and acceptance of elected officials. Actual or potential changes 
in these patterns and behaviors are sketched wherever there is solid evidence. 
</p>
<p>Some substantive issues potentially interesting to sociologists are deliberately omit-
ted here, in part because there is limited research available on them and in part because 
they are covered elsewhere in this volume. These include discrimination against women 
in federal and state bureaucracies (cf.. Naff, 1995), issues surrounding women's repre-
sentation in the military (Segal, 1995, and Chapter 27 of this volume) and the character 
and progress of women's movements in societies outside the United States (e.g., Margolis, 
1993; Patton, 1992; and Chapter 8 in this volume). There is no attempt to portray the 
gendered political, social, and economic consequences of planned and unplanned changes 
in developing societies (Acosta-Belen &amp; Bose, 1990; Patton, 1992; and Chapter 5 of this 
volume). In addition, social scientists (Moghadam, 1995; Molyneux, 1995; Peterson, 1995) 
have surveyed the massive changes from Communist to Democratic governments in Cen-
tral and Eastern Europe; in most instances, these changes have been far from beneficial 
to women. The new regimes seem to be pushing women out of the labor force and into 
more narrowly defined roles. At the same time, men vent their frustrations by attacking 
women, and feminists are portrayed as overwhelmingly self-centered. These findings are </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Politics 521 
</p>
<p>in sharp contrast to the generally positive changes that political scientists find in Western 
democracies. Covering these substantive changes in women's political status would re-
quire far more space than is allocated here. Indeed, much is omitted from this chapter, 
most notably dozens of books. Only a few recent, key articles are covered in each topic 
area; each of these typically refers to quite a few additional research articles in the same 
topic area. Together, these items suggest the range of questions and answers in contempo-
rary work on gender and politics. 
</p>
<p>2. THE GENDER GAP IN ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR 
</p>
<p>Women acquired the right to vote in all states with the passage of the Nineteenth Amend-
ment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920. For several decades thereafter, only very small 
numbers of women became candidates for public office, and women's rates of voting in 
presidential and Congressional elections were much lower than men's. Over the years, 
the number of women who voted increased, and by the early 1970s women's voting rates 
were virtually identical with those of men. Part of the rapprochement in voting rates was 
due to men's steadily declining rate of voting; women's voter turnout rates did not have to 
increase very much to equal those of men. In the 1992 presidential election, 62.3% of 
voting age women, but only 60.2% of voting age men, reported voting. While this differ-
ence is not very large, there are more women in the voting age population, so that in 
1992, 60.6 million women, compared to only 53.3 million men, participated. This differ-
ence in participation rates is consistent across the major race/ethnic groups. The Center 
for the American Woman and Politics reported that in the three presidential elections of 
1984, 1988, and 1992, "the number of female voters in recent elections has exceeded the 
number of male voters... . (and) the difference in voter tumour rates between the sexes is 
greatest for Blacks" (CAWP, 1979a, see also Welch &amp; Sigelman, 1992). Women also vote 
more often in Congressional elections in the "off (nonpresidential election) years, but 
the differences are not so marked. 
</p>
<p>2.1. Styles of Political Participation 
</p>
<p>The finding that women vote more often than men is partly encouraging, because it sug-
gests that at least some women are beginning to pursue their interests more vigorously 
and to see themselves as more politically efficacious, and partly puzzling, because it 
seems to contradict some longstanding differences in styles of participation and voter 
interest. In the 1980s, for instance, women were significantly less interested in politics 
than men and the lower interest remained even after controls for age, education, marital 
status, employment status, and occupation were introduced in the analysis (Bennett &amp; 
Bennett, 1992, cited in Hayes &amp; Makkai, 1996). In Australian elections, where voters 
must vote or pay a fine, men paid much more attention than women to televised debates 
between candidates and used the information gleaned there to decide how to vote. To 
account for these findings, Hayes and Makkai (1996) review several complementary ex-
planations, summarizing a large array of research on styles of political involvement in 
the process.

</p>
<p>in contrast to their male colleagues, the nature of women's political involvement is highly personal-
</p>
<p>ized and intimate. . . . Sources of information are more often ad hoc and of a familial or personalized 
</p>
<p>nature than the abstract party launches and sterile intellectual televised debates of party leaders (p. 
</p>
<p>65). 
</p>
<p>Hayes and Makkai also introduce concepts of disillusionment with the policies and prac-
tices of the major parties and disinterest, as when the issue is welfare reform rather than 
the size of welfare payments, to account for women's lesser involvement in media cam-
paigns. Thus, "politics as usual" appeal much less to women than to men. 
</p>
<p>2.2. Party and Candidate Preference 
</p>
<p>For several decades after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, women tended to 
vote for the same candidates that their husbands did. By 1980, however, women had 
gained more independence, and a gender gap in voting choices emerged. Women were 
much less likely than men to vote for Republican presidential candidates Reagan and 
Bush, even though a majority of them did so. After the 1980 election, Susan Carroll 
(1991, cited in Rosenthal, 1994) found that women who were most economically and 
psychologically independent were least likely to favor Reagan, "more than 20 percentage 
points less than the least autonomous women and men who shared similar demographic 
characteristics" (Rosenthal, 1994). Throughout the 1980s, women were consistently less 
likely than men to approve of the way Reagan and Bush handled their job as president. In 
1992, women preferred the victorious Democratic presidential candidate Clinton more 
than men, but the differences were not large: 45% versus 41%. Equal percentages of 
women and men voted for George Bush, and men voted more often for Ross Perot, the 
third-party candidate (CAWP, 1997a). Although women's votes and the gender gap have 
not yet been decisive in determining the outcome of a presidential election, candidates 
increasingly target the women's vote in their campaigns, and the women's vote has been 
decisive in some recent statewide elections for governor and for U.S. senator. Throughout 
the 1980s and 1990s, women claimed membership in the Democratic party more often 
than men did. In those years, in nearly all of the U.S. Senate and state gubernatorial 
elections in which an appreciable gender gap in candidate preference was noted, women 
almost always favored the Democratic candidate more and the Republican candidate less 
than did men (CAWP, 1997a). 
</p>
<p>At century's end, it is clear that women register to vote, actually prefer Democratic 
candidates at all levels of office, and approve of the performance of Democratic presi-
dents in greater numbers than men. Yet it is unclear whether women will recognize their 
mutual interests and become a much more self conscious voting bloc in the future. In the 
meantime, other facets of the gender gap and their sources remain to be examined. 
</p>
<p>2.3. Support for Women Candidates 
</p>
<p>In addition to differences between women and men in party and candidate preferences 
</p>
<p>already noted, women may be more likely than men to support women candidates. While 
</p>
<p>attitude surveys typically show small differences in willingness to vote for a woman for 
</p>
<p>president, the finding of no substantial gender gap must be weighed against the hypo-
</p>
<p>thetical nature of the question and the way in which the question is typically phrased. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Politics 523 
</p>
<p>Both women and men say they would vote for a woman candidate for president if she 
represents the respondent's party and is equally qualified as a male candidate. However, 
women and men candidates are rarely perceived as equally qualified. 
</p>
<p>For instance, in a survey (Brown, Heighberger, &amp; Shocket, 1993) regarding percep-
tions of how gender affects candidate ability in carrying out the tasks of city council 
members, the majority of those surveyed saw no difference between women and men 
candidates in their ability to handle nearly all of 10 internal or office functions or in their 
ability to deal with 13 diverse service or policy areas. However, a substantial minority did 
see differences, and on specific functions and issues, women and men respondents some-
times exhibited sizable differences in their evaluations of candidate gender. Women were 
seen as better able to handle two internal office functions&mdash;working with neighborhoods 
and citizens&mdash;while men were seen as better able to handle six office functions&mdash;working 
with city council members, making decisions, managing the office, solving city prob-
lems, dealing with crises, and providing leadership. In the matter of service or policy 
issues, women candidates were perceived as better able to handle four areas&mdash;services 
and programs for youth, public health, race relations, and recreation&mdash;while men were 
perceived as better able to handle eight areas&mdash;economic development, downtown and 
neighborhood business development, garbage collection, police and fire department ser-
vices, traffic engineering, and street maintenance. In some, but not all, of these areas 
women respondents saw men candidates as much more qualified and able than did men 
respondents. 
</p>
<p>Traditional stereotypes influenced the respondents' perceptions of candidate quality, 
as it did in several other studies conducted throughout the 1980s (summarized in Kahn, 
1994). The researchers stressed that women are aware of these stereotypes, which serve 
as one more impediment to women choosing to run for public office; those who do choose 
to run must provide specific information about themselves to counteract the stereotypes. 
They conclude that perception of the quality of candidates is enough to sway election 
outcomes, although women and men are not unified in their perceptions of the quality of 
women and men candidates. 
</p>
<p>Information may not effectively counter gendered stereotypes. Kim Kahn (1994) 
performed a content analysis of newspaper articles on candidates for statewide electoral 
positions, reasoning that differential coverage and stereotyping may affect voting behav-
ior in these gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races even though previous research suggested 
that voters did not enact gender stereotyping in lower level contests, such as those for 
state legislative seats. Controlling for whether the articles concerned incumbents or chal-
lengers for the office, she found substantial differences in the press coverage of women 
and men, with the differences larger in U.S. Senate than in gubernatorial races. For women 
candidates, the newspapers emphasized the state of the contest, that is, "horserace" or 
who was likely to win; especially in Senate races, women were described as less viable 
candidates than men. Meanwhile, the issues stressed by men candidates received a great 
deal more coverage. Kahn used the actual coverage to produce prototype articles to be 
used in an experimental design. These prototype articles systematically varied the sex of 
the candidate and the type of coverage received, as well as whether the candidate was a 
challenger or an incumbent. Participants in the experiment read these articles and then 
rated the candidate on a variety of different characteristics. 
</p>
<p>Ironically, the stereotyping that occurred in the respondents' ratings all applied to 
women&mdash;men appeared not to be stereotyped&mdash;and the stereotyping was generally posi-
tive for women candidates. Women candidates were seen as better able to deal with health </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>524 Elizabeth M. Esterchild 
</p>
<p>and education issues, as well as more compassionate and honest than men candidates, 
even when the two hypothetical candidates were described in exactly the same prototypi-
cal article. Women consistently rated hypothetical women candidates more positively 
than did men. Unfortunately, the stereotyping of women would not benefit women in the 
long run, especially in Senate races, because other issues&mdash;such as military deployment&mdash; 
are much more salient in those races. The reasons for the lower level of stereotyping in 
gubernatorial races may be that issues of health and education are seen as more important 
there. 
</p>
<p>2.4. Voting for WomenA^oting for Issues 
</p>
<p>Much of the foregoing research on perceptions of men and women candidates dealt with 
gender differences in an abstract sense, not with evaluations of specific candidates or 
with actual political or voting behavior. When we examine the latter, we find a detectable 
tendency for women to actually vote for women candidates more often than men do. The 
support for women candidates may stem from a feminist orientation, because women 
have been known to cross party lines to support a woman candidate. However, in at least 
one case women's votes were responsible for electing an antifeminist woman (CAWP, 
1997a). What is needed, then, is research that not only compares women and men but 
also examines differences among women and among men. 
</p>
<p>In one carefully organized survey in Oklahoma City (Rosenthal, 1992), respondents 
were asked about their preference for "descriptive representation," that is, for having a 
man or woman represent them in four separate areas. They were asked whether they 
trusted women or men candidates more, whether they would rather deal with a man or a 
woman on a problem that required a governmental solution, whether a man or a woman 
in public office would be more likely to have the same concerns as they do about our 
country, and the likelihood of voting for a man or woman candidate if they had similar 
platforms and qualifications. Respondents were given five response categories: would 
prefer a man much more, would prefer a man somewhat more, would prefer a man or a 
woman about equally, would prefer a woman somewhat more, and would prefer a woman 
much more. Men were much more likely to give the equalitarian response (between 10% 
and 20% more men than women on the various items) while women were more likely to 
prefer a woman by 8% to 30%. Women and men were about equally likely to prefer a man 
to represent them. The authors then proceeded to explore the correlates of preferring 
representation by women, neglecting to highlight the majority who gave at least one 
gender-neutral response on the four items. All this suggests that men as potential allies 
for women's and feminists' concerns is an avenue of research that remains untraveled. 
</p>
<p>2.5. Interpreting Gender Differences 
</p>
<p>How might we interpret these findings, for instance that women appear less interested in 
</p>
<p>television coverage of candidates but vote more often? Or that women prefer women 
</p>
<p>candidates more often while men more often state that the sex of the candidate makes no 
</p>
<p>difference to them? Sometimes the findings from separate studies differ a good deal, but 
</p>
<p>that is partly because the various research projects concentrate on different levels and 
</p>
<p>types of political activity, and assess the issues for different offices (e.g., city council </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Politics 525 
</p>
<p>versus U.S. Senate). Moreover, in a time of rapid social change, behavioral and attitudi-
nal changes in one area or among one group may not correspond with changes in other 
areas or groups. Thus, for instance, while women in the contemporary U.S. have taken to 
voting with greater frequency, they may or may not be especially enthusiastic supporters 
of women candidates. Similarly, while some women may vote for candidates from the 
Democratic party and for liberal positions on issues, they may not specifically connect 
their viewpoints with a feminist agenda. Again, in much of the research women and men 
are treated as individuals who have experienced different socialization content and who 
play different roles in society. Rarely is there an attempt to go beyond these descriptive 
differences to distinguish among competing explanations of gendered political behavior. 
</p>
<p>However, Johnston and Sapiro (1993) noted the strong differences between women 
and men in support for the military and warfare, and explicitly tested alternative explana-
tions. They reasoned that women's more pacifist orientation could be rooted in sex and 
gender, in the mothering behavior of women, or in feminism. The sex and gender theme 
has various strands, some conveying the old-fashioned idea that men are biologically 
more aggressive (sex) while some suggest that boys and girls are socialized differently 
(gender). The mothering or maternalist reasoning suggests that not only are women more 
concerned about the safety and health of their children, but in addition that "many mater-
nal practices incorporate the essential ideals of nonviolent peacemaking: renunciation, 
resistance, reconciliation, and peacekeeping" (Conover &amp; Sapiro, 1993, p. 1081). In this 
view, to be effective, women would need to become much more conscious of the possibih-
ties for peacemaking that stem from their mothering behavior. Finally feminist theorists 
believe it is feminist thinking that motivates people to be peacemakers; because more 
women than men are feminists, a gender gap in attitudes remains. Measuring general 
views about militarism and war, as well as specific reactions to the Gulf War, Johnston 
and Sapiro found little support for the mothering hypothesis, but stress that their mea-
sures of mothering are weak and imperfect. They found no support for either the gender 
or the feminism explanations of general attitudes toward war. Instead, highly militaristic 
viewpoints were produced by having a strong sense of patriotism, a conservative ideol-
ogy, and a low educational level. Moreover, there was no gender gap in military ideology 
to begin with, but women and men apparently take slightly different routes to reach their 
views. Men are more influenced by identifying with a political party, women are more 
influenced by educational level (Conover &amp; Sapiro, 1993). 
</p>
<p>In regard to the Gulf War specifically, there were no gender differences in interest in 
the war, but other differences did appear. 
</p>
<p>. . . because oftheir heightened sensitivity to the use of violence, feminists might be expected to pay 
</p>
<p>greater attention to the war. And they did. Also as compared to men and nonfeminists, respectively, 
</p>
<p>women and feminists were expected to be less supportive of the war, more opposed to the bombing of 
</p>
<p>civilians, and more emotionally distressed by the war. . . . in every case, these expectations were 
</p>
<p>borne out. (Conover &amp; Sapiro, 1993, p. 1092) 
</p>
<p>Here, as well as in other contexts, gender differences stem from a number of sources. 
Women and men are pointed in different directions by variables of age, race, and party 
identification. The authors conclude that the origins and determinants of attitudes are 
extremely complex. 
</p>
<p>A gender gap appears in certain times and places and contexts and disappears in a 
haze of contradictory influences in others. As with nonpolitical behavior and attitudes, 
women and men are arguably more similar than different. However, in politics, the mar-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>526 Elizabeth M. Esterchild 
</p>
<p>ginal differences are often quite enough to affect outcomes. We turn now to a very impor-
tant outcome; tiie election of women to political office. 
</p>
<p>2.6. Women Gaining Political Office 
</p>
<p>The higher the level of political office, the fewer women who run and the fewer women 
who are elected. In 1997, women held 21% of state legislative seats but 11% of national 
congressional seats (CAWP, 1997a, b). Within state legislatures, women had a smaller 
share of the upper house than the lower house. Winning statewide elective offices has 
slightly different dimensions. While women held 81 of the 323 of the available positions 
(25%), they held only two (4%) of the governorships, but 18 (36 %) of the lieutenant 
governorships. The other 61 women in statewide elective offices were scattered among 
various state offices, such as treasurer, comptroller, heads of education departments, and 
so forth (CAWP, 1997b). Whether some states are more likely to elect women to these 
positions than others is an unanswered question. Overall, women are more likely to win 
gubernatorial elections than they are to win U.S. Senate seats. 
</p>
<p>Women have gained national attention in mayoral races; currently 12 of the hundred 
largest cities in the United States have women mayors. Women hold 21% of the mayoral 
slots in cities with populations over 30,000. Separate data are not given for smaller cities, 
but in 1994, in cities with over 10,000 in population, women comprised 21% of the 
combined mayors and city council members (CAWP, 1997c). 
</p>
<p>2.7. Women's National Officeholding 
</p>
<p>Women held only about 2% of the U.S. Congressional seats in 1970 compared to 11% 
now (CAWP, 1997e). This a fivefold gain, but at this rate of change, it will require 120 
years for women to reach parity with men. However, some acceleration of the increase 
began in the late 1980s, highlighted by the labeling of 1992 as "the year of the woman." 
Increases have continued since then; in 1970 there were only 11 women in Congress, in 
1980 there were 17, in 1990 31, and in 1998 there were 60 (CAWP 1997e). Over time, 
1992 has been more intensively studied than any other Congressional election year. In 
that year, women's representation jumped from four to seven seats in the Senate and from 
28 to 47 Seats in the House. That may have been an unusual year because substantial 
redistricting had been accomplished, and many incumbents had incentives to retire leav-
ing more seats open in the U.S. House of Representatives than had been available in a 
long time. Usually, turnover in the U.S. House is extremely slow, allowing few opportuni-
ties for newcomers to gain a toehold (Nixon &amp; Darcy, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Neil Berch (1996) studied the 1992 election, testing six alternative hypotheses con-
cerning the increase. Each of these hypotheses suggest changes that were beneficial to 
women's candidacy and that may be important for other levels of political offices as well. 
</p>
<p>1. Women were more willing to seek higher office, in part because they have secured 
lower level offices and want to proceed further. This reduces the gender gap in 
ambition, thereby enlarging the pool of women candidates. 
</p>
<p>2. Women were more likely to have the political experience and background, as well 
as the occupations that predict being successful candidates. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Politics 527 
</p>
<p>3. Women were less likely to be "sacrificial lambs," as they competed in more easily 
winnable election districts. 
</p>
<p>4. Owing in part to an increase in political action committees devoted to women's 
interests (National Women's Political Caucus, EMILY's List, etc.), the funding 
gap between women and men may have decreased. 
</p>
<p>5. The funds that women spent actually netted more votes per dollar than in previ-
ous elections. 
</p>
<p>6. There was a decrease in voter bias and perhaps in media bias as well. 
</p>
<p>Comparing 1992 with elections between 1986 and 1990 and with 1994, Berch found that 
1992 was a banner year because more women ran for open seats, especially among the 
Democrats, and because there appeared to be an increase in funding for women and a 
decrease in the "sacrificial lamb" phenomenon. He concluded that the increase in 1992 
was part of a general trend toward more women being elected, and was partly predictable 
and partly anomalous in terms of the effects of the variables that influence women to run 
and help them to succeed. 
</p>
<p>Support for the anomalous character of the 1992 elections comes from Susan Hansen's 
(1997) research. She focused on proselytizing activities&mdash;trying to persuade other people 
to vote for a given candidate&mdash;an area where men have traditionally been more active. 
She studied this phenomenon in races for the U.S. House, U.S. Senate, and for state 
governor positions, comparing those that had a woman candidate versus those that did 
not. She found that 
</p>
<p>In 1992, the presence of women candidates was associated with higher levels of political involve-
</p>
<p>ment, internal political efficacy, and media use by both sexes, butthe effects of candidate gender 
</p>
<p>were stronger for women. In the congressional elections of 1990 and 1994, however, candidate 
</p>
<p>gender had no such impact (Hansen, 1997, p. 73) 
</p>
<p>Research on congresses and parliaments in countries outside the United States is 
relatively scanty; comparative cross-national research is rarer still. Clearly, the same kinds 
of factors that affect women's election to the U.S. Congress often operate in other coun-
tries as well. Women are more likely to be elected in progressive Western style democra-
cies in Europe, and less likely to be elected in more traditional and non-Western societies, 
but the reasons are not completely clear (Oakes &amp; Almquist, 1994). In cross-national 
studies, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of modernization and women's increasing 
movement into the labor force from changing attitudes toward women in office and the 
nature of the party and electoral systems. There is too much overlap (colinearity) among 
some of these variables while other variables (such as political system) are nonlinear 
typologies so that multiple regression equations do not capture the significant differences 
among different societies. As a result, different researchers studying different societies 
and using different measures and data sources sometimes produce contradictory results. 
</p>
<p>An especially important issue outside the United States is that of why multimember 
districts with proportional systems of representation enhance opportunities for women to 
be elected. In 1993, in Western democracies with party list systems, 20% of the legisla-
tors were women, while women comprised only 9% of the legislators in countries with 
single-member districts (Matland &amp; Studlar, 1996). Studlar and Welch (1991) found that 
multimember districts aided women candidates in London local elections, but not very 
much. Multitmember districts with proportional systems and party lists (of candidates) 
may advantage women because voters are willing to vote for one woman among several 
candidates rather than cast their only vote for a woman. However, Karen Beckwith (1992) </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>528 Elizabeth M. Esterchild 
</p>
<p>argues that cross-national research obscures the real reasons why women may benefit 
from such systems. Studies of both France and Italy, countries where electoral systems 
changed repeatedly, revealed that women's chances for success are equally likely to be 
affected by the behavior of political parties and the degree of party competition within the 
systems, as well as by the development of a political climate that is increasingly favorable 
to women and by the growth and spread of feminist movements. Similarly, Matland and 
Studlar (1996), studying Canada and Norway, suggested that the salient effects of 
multimember districts occurred primarily because of political contagion: smaller leftist 
parties introduced women candidates first, and larger, more traditional parties then be-
gan fielding more women as a way of remaining competitive and appealing to the broad-
est possible spectrum of voters. Hickman (1997) advocates the use of multimember dis-
tricts in local, prefectural, and national elections in Japan, because women are so greatly 
underrepresented at all levels. Regardless of the precise mechanisms involved. Rule (1987) 
concludes that the use of multimember districts is the single most important factor affect-
ing women's representation in national legislatures. 
</p>
<p>Other researchers (cf. Studlar &amp; McAllister, 1991) argue that incumbency is the 
most important factor because it operates as a vicious circle. Incumbents are typically 
reelected and since women have difficulty being elected in the first place, they cannot 
become incumbents to be reelected! However, Nixon and Darcy (1996) argue that in the 
United States, a focus on incumbency as a deterrent to women's election ignores the 
impact of special elections in increasing the numbers of women in Congress. During the 
1980s and 1990s, fully one third of all women elected to Congress won their seats in 
special elections. Women won a large proportion of the special elections, even when there 
was a male opponent. Most of these women had already well-established political ca-
reers. In this way, vacancies due to death or illness create more opportunities for politi-
cally minded women to pursue higher level office. 
</p>
<p>2.8. State Legislatures in the United States 
</p>
<p>Both incumbency and multinember districts have been shown to affect women's repre-
sentation in the United States; incumbency and the subsequent lack of interparty compe-
tition diminishes women's success rates across many state legislatures but in the few 
states that have multimember districts, women have better chances to be elected. Explor-
ing the impact of multimember districts on electoral success, Darcy, Hadley, and Kirksey 
(1993) found that the underrepresentation of blacks at various levels of government is 
due almost exclusively to the underrepresentation of black women; black men seem to 
achieve an equitable share of political offices while black women do not. They suggest 
increasing, rather than decreasing as is currently the case, the number of multimember 
districts as a way of increasing the numbers of black women elected without in any way 
undermining the election of black men. 
</p>
<p>Women's election to public office is most often studied in state legislatures, which is 
an important location because women represent women's interests more often than even 
feminist-oriented men do and because the issues addressed there substantially affect 
women's lives. These include matters such as pay equity/comparable worth, aid to depen-
dent children, domestic violence, the rights of women in marriage and divorce, and the 
equal rights amendment (Darcy, Welch, &amp; Clark 1987). In addition, state legislative seats 
serve as springboards for seeking election to higher office. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Politics 529 
</p>
<p>Grounded in Irene Diamond's (1977) landmark study and fueled by continuing re-
ports from the Center for American Woman and Politics of Rutgers University, this re-
search paints a relatively detailed portrait of the conditions that can predict whether 
women hold a large, moderate, or small portion of state legislative seats and begins to 
assess the circumstances that help increase women's representation therein. However, 
some of these conditions and circumstances, especially those that relate to change in 
women's involvement in state legislatures, are too blurry to enable one to glean a clear 
image of future trends. 
</p>
<p>Diamond (1977) found that for the early 1970s, the size of the legislature relative to 
the state's population was the most important factor in women's election to office. In 
states with large legislatures and small populations, women were more successful. This 
occurred because women could compete for votes more effectively in small election dis-
tricts. They could more easily reach neighbors and community members in these small 
districts than they could persuade voters in large anonymous districts that required televi-
sion advertising to be successful. The small election districts, large legislatures were 
most prevalent in the Republican-dominated New England states. 
</p>
<p>Wilma Rule (1990) completed massive research on changes between 1974 and 1984 
in factors that improve women's selection for state legislative seats. Among the many 
structural factors she considered. Republican party dominance of legislatures and moral-
istic state political culture were continuing favorable factors; small legislatures in high-
population states and low average income were no longer unfavorable for women's elec-
tion; Democratic party dominance, especially in southern states, and traditional political 
culture continued to impede the election of women. In the meantime, some new condi-
tions emerged as aiding in women's recruitment to legislatures in 1984. These were indi-
vidualistic political culture, multimember legislative districts, high labor force participa-
tion rates among women, and women being strongly represented among professionals. 
Having more women in Congress and the presence of multiple chapters of the National 
Organization for Women were also positively correlated with women's share of state 
legislative seats, but these factors may simply accompany increases in women's share 
rather than causing such increases. Most of the structural and cultural variables that 
affect women's success changed very little over the decade between 1974 and 1984, but 
women were increasingly able to negotiate the structural barriers and increasingly will-
ing to try to surmount the cultural barriers. Rule (1990) was relatively optimistic that 
increases would continue because women had become increasingly able to amass the 
resources necessary to compete effectively and were spurred on by commitment to the 
feminist movement. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, Rule's predictions were borne out by later elections, but the fact that women's 
representation continued to increase is not an indicator of uniform success. When the 
upper and lower houses of the state legislature are considered separately (Dunn &amp; Almquist, 
1993), changes are very uneven within states and across the 50 states. Increasing repre-
sentation of women in the two houses has some similar determinants and some different 
ones. In both houses, the larger women's share of the total employed persons in the state, 
the larger the increase in women's share of the legislative seats. However, the more often 
women with preschool-aged children were employed, the smaller the increase. High lev-
els of interparty competition, which increases turnover and permits women and other 
underrepresented groups more opportunity to run and win, are also associated with greater 
increases in women's share of the seats in both houses. Women achieved substantial 
gains in representation in states where there are a large number of seats in the lower </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>530 Elizabeth M. Esterchild 
</p>
<p>house but not in the upper house. More importantly, in the upper house, women's share of 
seats in 1980 is negatively associated with gains that occurred by 1993, that is, the more 
state senate seats women held in 1980, the smaller were their gains. This might be inter-
preted as a glass ceiling effect in state senates, or the possibility that after a few women 
have been elected to the senate, voters are reluctant to elect still more (Dunn &amp; Almquist, 
1993). 
</p>
<p>Again, the preceding research suggests that structural and cultural changes have 
been relatively small, but that women have increasingly garnered more political resources 
and are increasingly willing to take the risks associated with entering state legislative 
campaigns. Another study of women as state legislators confirms this hunch. Dolan and 
Ford (1997) developed profiles of all women state legislators serving in 15 states in 1972, 
1982, and 1992, and compared them with a sample of men legislators in the same states. 
Contemporary (1992) women legislators were found to differ significantly from their pre-
decessors: they had more professional occupational experience; they were younger and 
more often married; they were more likely to belong to business and professional organi-
zations and less likely to come from a background of charity and volunteer work; they 
were more likely to come to the state legislature from a background of service on city 
council and less likely to have served in an appointed position in some type of service to 
the city or community; and finally they were somewhat less likely to be involved in state 
and national political parties. The researchers asked whether these changes are also char-
acteristic of men legislators so that they do not have special significance for the increased 
representation of women in these states. They found that men legislators were not appre-
ciably different in 1992 from their predecessors. Men had the same professional occupa-
tions and political backgrounds they had exhibited earlier, while their participation in 
both civic and business or professional groups had declined. Moreover, unlike women, 
contemporary men were more rather than less likely to be involved in traditional political 
parties. In summary, women legislators are becoming more like men legislators, who 
have mostly stayed in the same grooves from which their predecessors operated. 
</p>
<p>2.9. Campaigning and Campaign Financing 
</p>
<p>Political elections often pit women directly against men, and it is a truism that women 
cannot be elected if they do not run. Personal ambition appears to be the only major factor 
affecting male city council members' decision to run for higher level office, but it is not 
an important factor for women (Bledsoe &amp; Herring, 1990). Ambition is tempered by 
perceptions of having won a city council seat by a large or a small margin and by whether 
the council member was elected at-large or in a single-member district. Women may be 
socialized to not appear pushy and hence to disavow political ambition; they may require 
larger margins of victory in city council elections to induce them to pursue higher level 
offices; they may pursue higher office "out of a sense of service to the community rather 
than out of a desire to enhance their own careers" (Bledsoe &amp; Herring, 1990, p. 218). 
Overall, they are more likely to see themselves as amateurs committed to a principle than 
as professional politicians exercising competitive strategies. 
</p>
<p>Traditionally in the United States, women with families, especially with young chil-
dren, have been reluctant to run for political office. While this barrier may be declining in 
significance in the United States, it remains a major obstacle to women choosing to run in </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Politics 531 
</p>
<p>Australia (Studlar &amp; McAllister, 1991). The presence of families may hamper women's 
selection for appointive office as well. Panels who select new members of the judiciary 
have been known to comment "He has a wife and family. She has a husband. He needs 
this job, and she doesn't" (Githens, 1995). A spouse and children may be regarded as a 
stabilizing influence on men, but as a potential disruption for women serving in office. 
</p>
<p>Once women decide to run for office, there is the issue of deciding how to campaign. 
In recent times, negative ads are increasingly used because negative information carries 
more weight than positive information, is more memorable, and can sometimes be disas-
sociated from the candidate presenting it. Political challengers are more likely than in-
cumbents to attack with negative ads (Procter, Schenck-Hamlin, &amp; Haase, 1994). While 
advertising may be especially important for women because they can control the mes-
sages that are broadcast, political advisers frequently counsel women to avoid negative 
ads because an attack on the opponent may backfire and decrease their chances for elec-
tion. In a study of all statewide elections (governor and U.S. Senate races) that had candi-
dates of both sexes in 1990, women were found to be nearly as likely to use negative 
advertising as men, and to use substantially similar approaches and content in these ads 
(Procter, Schenck-Hamlin, &amp; Hasse, 1994). These recent findings imply that women and 
men campaign similarly and that women no longer stand out as using different approaches 
to the whole process. 
</p>
<p>In 1992 races for election to the U.S. House of Representatives, Dabelko and Hermson 
(1997) discovered a great deal of convergence in campaign styles. "Women and men 
(gave) similar reasons for running, assembled comparable campaign resources, and em-
ployed similar strategies and communications techniques" (p. 121). However, they cam-
paigned on different issues, with women more likely to campaign on social as well as 
economic issues. The convergence in campaign styles helped women to win office more 
often than in earlier years, and the divergence in issues did not significantly damage their 
chances for success. 
</p>
<p>Campaign financing is a very important issue for candidates. In Congressional elec-
tions in recent years, women candidates acquired as much funding on average as men 
candidates did. Brian Werner (1997) focused on state legislative campaigns in states 
where funding data were available, which also happened to be states that had more pro-
fessional (full-time and research oriented) legislatures with average or higher levels of 
campaign spending. Women raised as much money as men did across a large number of 
elections, but their equahty in fund raising may not result in net gains in winning elec-
tions, because the male opponents of women candidates raised more money than men 
who did not face women as opponents. Incumbent as well as challenger men exhibited 
this pattern. " . . . the pattern suggests that women challengers are taken more seriously 
than the average male challenger" (Werner, 1997, p. 91). This idea that women enter 
races with a "higher profile" and that they spur men to generate more campaign money is 
the only clear hint that women and men compete directly for office and for control and 
power in contested territory. 
</p>
<p>3. ACTIVITIES AND ACCEPTANCE OF WOMEN IN PUBLIC OFFICE 
</p>
<p>Over time, women have begun to participate in electoral politics more actively, especially 
</p>
<p>by increasing their rate of voting, supporting liberal Democratic and women candidates. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>532 Elizabeth M. Esterchild 
</p>
<p>and by choosing to run for office themselves. What do women do once they win office? 
How are they accepted into the seats of official power? The research evidence is inad-
equate to provide definitive answers to these questions, but a few studies imply that women 
are more successful in achieving their political goals now than they were formerly, that 
they actively pursue women's interests, and that they are gaining acceptance in U.S. state 
legislatures at least. 
</p>
<p>In three states&mdash;Washington, Minnesota, and Oregon&mdash;all states in which women 
have a larger than average share of state legislative seats (CAWP)&mdash;women legislators 
work actively to support women's interests. Once elected, they give money, help in cam-
paigns, and give advice to newer women candidates; these forms of support are crucial in 
assisting women to win in some races. Moreover, while women incumbents typically 
actively support only candidates from their own party, they are also substantially willing 
to support male candidates who are obviously sympathetic to women's issues (Gierzynski 
&amp; Budreck, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Historically, women representatives have been reluctant to push for women's spe-
cific interest because they feared being labeled as too "narrow" or as "only" interested in 
women's issues. Today they are more likely to agree with U.S. Representative Barbara 
Kelly, who remarked "My business is to get legislation through. My added business is to 
get legislation through to help women" (cited in Thomas &amp; Welch, 1991). In 12 state 
legislatures there were no significant differences between women and men in giving 
speeches in the legislature, meeting with lobbyists, and bargaining to secure votes. The 
small differences that did exist disappeared when controls for constituency and party 
variables were introduced. However, in terms of issues, women are "busier" than men. 
They are more likely to introduce and give priority to bills supporting children, women, 
and social welfare, while men are more active than women only in regard to bills that 
reflect business issues (Thomas &amp; Welch, 1991). Committee assignments in these 12 
legislatures also revealed that women had gained access to more diverse committees than 
formerly, but women were less likely than men to serve on business and economics com-
mittees and more likely to sit on health and welfare ones. These findings are consistent 
with their policy priorities. 
</p>
<p>Women state legislators are also more likely than men to give direct service to their 
constituencies. Women receive more casework requests, believe that they perform more 
casework than their male colleagues, and would perform even more services if more staff 
were available (Richardson &amp; Freeman, 1995). The authors explain these findings by 
saying that women are more likely than men to be socialized to care about interpersonal 
relations. 
</p>
<p>Finally, only one piece of recent research examines the impact of greater numbers of 
women; this research compares state legislators in Australia and the United States. 
Considine and Deutchman (1996) distinguish between social structure and culture. They 
find that sheer numbers of women make little difference in how women legislators are 
regarded. More women are elected and accepted on various committees than in the past, 
but this does not necessarily change legislative culture. Men are still regarded as typical 
politicians; women's differences from men are viewed as both assets (we get another 
point of view) and liabilities (they have too many things going on to be good legislators); 
and women and their activities are viewed as conspicuous and subject to different quali-
ties and demands from men's. Thus, while more women are incorporated into the legisla-
ture, they are still seen as atypical politicians and have little impact on legislative culture. </p>

<p>4. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS 
</p>
<p>The research shows a persistent and possibly increasing gender gap in attitudes and be-
havior, with women more likely than men to vote and more likely to support women and 
Democratic liberal candidates. It also reveals that women are increasingly likely to run 
for office themselves and to win the election contests that they enter. Still, there is persis-
tent evidence that women candidates (either hypothetical or real) suffer from stereotypes 
about their ability and interests. Even when the stereotypes are positive (e.g., women take 
more time with their constituents and are more interested in family and education than 
men), they are viewed as being competent in areas that are of less concern to the typical 
voter. Women candidates for office are becoming increasingly sophisticated in structur-
ing their campaigns, and are able to garner more resources, often from women, than in 
the past. 
</p>
<p>The research reveals a growing effort to map how political opportunity structures 
exert their deleterious impact on women's issues and women's electability. This is ac-
companied by a strong tendency to visualize political structure as a "given." Political 
organization is viewed as being fairly rigid but increasingly permeable so that women can 
sometimes climb over, around, or through the barriers to their campaigning and being 
elected. The characteristics of women candidates change, but political structure does not. 
While women now comprise a sizable minority of officials in some state legislatures and 
city councils, only a handful of publications ask how women and/or feminists might 
change the structure and culture of the political system. 
</p>
<p>Authors in this growing research literature appear to be reluctant to see gender as 
much more than a shorthand concept for showing that women and men are somewhat 
different as political participants. There are few, if any, attempts to see gender as power 
and/or as a relationship. Thus, explanations of why women and men differ in voting and 
political participation typically refer back to a socialization hypothesis: women and men 
were treated and raised differently as children; therefore they have learned to be different 
as adults. 
</p>
<p>The very limited theorizing about gender and politics means that there is a substan-
tial gap in the research literature, one that sociologists should and could attempt to fill. 
The findings about political structure and elections could easily be cast within the context 
of macrostructural theories of gender inequality (Blumberg, 1984; Chafetz, 1984, 1990). 
These perspectives explain patterns of gender inequality in different arenas, especially in 
work and family; they have less often been applied to understanding stratification in the 
political arena. Such an application would extend our understanding of both the gendered 
world of politics and gender stratification in general.

<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>A decade ago, the standard opening paragraph of a review chapter such as this would 
deplore the paucity of criminological research on females and the sexism inherent in 
theoretical accounts of female crime (and conformity). Owing primarily to the work of 
feminist criminologists, the field has happily moved beyond such obvious deficiencies. In 
this chapter, we review the criminological and criminal justice literature that examines 
the gendered organization of crime and social control. To do so, we briefly discuss the 
origins of the feminist critique in criminology and review patterns of criminal offending 
and justice interventions by gender. Specific issues that have arisen within feminist crimi-
nology (e.g., the implications of equal treatment for male and female offenders) are used 
to highlight more recent theoretical and empirical developments in the field. 
</p>
<p>Relative to other social science disciplines, criminology was a latecomer to feminist 
concerns. Second wave feminism was well-established when select criminologists noted 
the absence of females from major theories of criminal offending and/or the sexist treat-
ment of females within theories in which they were not ignored (Harris, 1977; Heidensohn, 
1968; Klein, 1973; Leonard, 1982; Rasche, 1974). The work of two female criminolo-
gists&mdash;Rita Simon (1975) and Freda Adler (1975)&mdash;sparked mainstream criminology's

<p>interest in the female offender (along with that of the popular press) by hypothesizing 
that the women's liberation movement had created a new type of female offender. Simon 
suggested that as employment opportunities opened up for women, so too had white-
collar offending opportunities. Adler predicted that female participation in all crimes 
(including violence) would converge with male rates as the women's movement changed 
perceptions of acceptable and unacceptable conduct among females. Criticisms of Simon's 
and Adler's work provided a springboard from which more explicitly feminist under-
standings of crime and justice were launched. 
</p>
<p>2. PATTERNS OF CRIMINAL OFFENDING BY GENDER 
</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, when Simon and Adler were writing, female rates of participation in 
most kinds of criminal offending&mdash;especially serious crime&mdash;were low. Their research 
raised several important questions regarding the gender and crime relationship that fu-
eled somewhat separate research agendas for mainstream and feminist scholars: (1) What 
can account for such low participation rates in serious crime by women vis a vis men? (2) 
Are these patterns changing over time (i.e., is a new female offender emerging)? (3) Are 
the factors that produce crime and conformity in males and females the same? Do the 
same forces drive changes in male and female rates? (4) How should feminists study 
crime? 
</p>
<p>The answers to some of these questions lie in the empirical record. In the Tables 24-
1 to 24-3, male and female rates of offending are compared over time using official arrest 
data (Uniform Crime Reports) and offender self -reports (Monitoring the Future Project). 
</p>
<p>In Table 24-1, male and female arrest rates per 100,000 are compared across 15-year 
intervals beginning in 1960 (columns 1 to 6). These statistics demonstrate several impor-
tant patterns. First, they show that most crimes are committed by males. This pattern is 
most notable in violent and serious property crime rates, but exists across the board ex-
cept for prostitution, in which female rates are higher than those for males. For the most 
part, increases and decreases in male and female rates over time parallel each other, 
suggesting that the rates of both "are influenced by similar social and legal forces, inde-
pendent of any condition unique to women or men" (Steffensmeier &amp; Allan, 1996, p. 
462). 
</p>
<p>Looking at the arrest profiles of males and females (i.e., the percentage of total male 
and female arrests within each crime category for 1960 and 1990) and comparing data 
from 1960 and 1990 (columns 7 to 10), it is clear that violent crime (excluding simple 
assault) is a rare offense for both sexes. Females are most apt to be arrested for larceny-
theft (20%), alcohol related offenses (i.e., drunkenness and DUI), and, more recently, 
forgery, frauds, and drug abuse. The greatest proportion of male arrests are for DUI (15% 
in 1990, up from 5% in 1960) and larceny-theft, followed by public drunkenness (drop-
ping from 36% of all male arrests in 1960 to 8% in 1990). 
</p>
<p>Overall, females exceed 50% of the total arrests in only one offense area&mdash;prostitu-
tion (columns 12 to 13). The next highest categories are minor property offenses (includ-
ing larceny-theft, fraud, forgery, and embezzlement in which female percentages range 
between 30% and 43% of total arrests). Males, on the other hand, clearly dominate the 
arrest statistics in more serious crime categories, such as crimes against persons, major 
property, and malicious mischief (which includes auto theft and arson). They also ac-
count for relatively large arrest percentages in some trivial crime categories (e.g., va-</p>

</p>
<p>the new breed of female offender (i.e., becoming more like her male counterpart) is, as 
</p>
<p>described by Steffensmeier (1978) almost 20 years ago, more myth than reality.

<p>In Table 24-2, we present raw arrest statistics for juvenile offenders by sex for the

<p>years 1984 and 1994 (Sourcebook of CriminalJustice Statistics, 1985; 1995). The fig-
</p>
<p>ures for juveniles tell a similar but somewhat more complex story. Again, we see that 
</p>
<p>males are arrested much more often than females for almost all types of crimes. For index 
</p>
<p>offenses (murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor ve-
</p>
<p>hicle theft, and arson), the ratio of male to female arrests was approximately 3:1 in 1994. </p>

<p>Source: Uniform Crime Report Data, taken from the Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, 1985, 1995. 
</p>
<p>The arrest ratio was much greater for violent than for property crime (e.g., in 1994, the 
male-to-female arrest ratio for violence was 6:1; for property, 2.9:1). Within the index, 
the most common offense for which both females and males are arrested is larceny-theft. 
Female arrests exceed those for males in two main categories: (1) running away from 
home and (2) prostitution and vice. 
</p>
<p>In 1984, the top five offenses for which males were arrested were larceny-theft, all 
other offenses, burglary, vandalism, and liquor laws, and for females during the same 
time period, larceny-theft, runaway, all other offenses, liquor laws, and curfew and loi-
tering offenses were the top five arrest categories. There were some changes in arrest </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Crime, and Criminal Justice 541 
</p>
<p>patterns by the next decade, although change did not occur at the top of either list. The 
data in Table 24-2 show that the most common offenses for juveniles are relatively minor. 
This is particularly true for females where status offenses (such as runaway and curfew 
and loitering) comprise a significant but declining proportion of female total arrests over 
time (approximately 24% of all female arrests in 1984 and 23% in 1994). 
</p>
<p>In Table 24-3, we report findings from a national survey of high school seniors 
(Bachman, Johnston, &amp; O'Malley, 1988 as reported in the Sourcebook of Criminal Sta-
tistics, 1995; Johnston, Bachman, and O'Malley, 1983, 1993) in which students report 
involvement in delinquent activities for the 12-month period prior to their participation 
in the survey. From these data, we can see that involvement in crime is atypical regardless 
of gender. As in the arrest statistics, the most common self -reported delinquent activity 
was theft. In 1983, 34% of the boys and 21% of the girls reported taking something from 
a store without paying for it on at least one occasion. These numbers increased slightly 
over the decade. Far fewer reported taking items worth $50.00 or more, offenses that 
signify involvement in more serious types of theft. Trespassing is the next most com-
monly reported act for both boys and girls, followed by vandalizing school property and 
getting into fights&mdash;at school or to support friends. Rarely do the latter result in serious 
injuries&mdash;especially when the combatants are female. It is important to note, however, 
that few of these respondents report frequent involvement in any of these delinquent acts. 
</p>
<p>3. MAKING SENSE OF THE EMPIRICAL RECORD 
</p>
<p>Mainstream scholars find little empirical evidence, either in the United States or cross-
nationally, to support Adler's or Simon's claims (Mukherjee &amp; Scott, 1981; Steffensmeier, 
1978; see Kruttschnitt 1996 and Simpson, 1989, for further discussion of these studies). 
The empirical record suggested that female crime rates have been remarkably stable over 
time, particularly in the more serious crime categories. When increases did occur, it was 
generally in areas in which female crime had been concentrated for decades (e.g., theft). 
Some increases were noted in nontraditional areas, such as embezzlement, forgery, and 
fraud (Simon, 1975, 1990), but disentangling occupational crimes from non-white-collar 
offenses (e.g., accounting from welfare fraud, stock forgeries from writing bad checks) in 
the statistical record is impossible without much more detailed investigation. Daly's (1989c) 
research on gender and white-collar crime demonstrated the fallacy of linking changing 
rates of female arrests for embezzlement, fraud, or forgery to increases in women's labor 
force participation. The so-called "white-collar" female offenders in Daly's sample were 
employed in "pink-collar" positions. Unlike most of the male offenders, but similar to 
conventional female offenders, presentence reports indicated that these women offended 
not because they were liberated, but because they were economically marginalized. Need, 
not greed, drove the "white"-collar offending of most women. 
</p>
<p>Feminist scholars were highly critical of the women's liberation thesis (Leonard, 
1982). First, it ran counter to what feminist criminologists had discovered about female 
criminals, that is, that criminality was concentrated among the economically disadvan-
taged and minorities. Prejudice and discrimination, unemployment, the economic segre-
gation of women into low-paying, nonunionized, and unstable jobs, and the feminization 
of poverty were more likely explanations for female offending than liberation (Giordano, 
Kerbel, &amp; Dudley, 1977; Klein, 1973; Simpson, 1991). Second, the idea that females 
were becoming more malelike in their offending patterns captured the imagination of the </p>

<p>popular press despite the paucity of empirical evidence supporting the claim. The media's 
emphasis on the dark side of women's liberation created a "moral panic" (Smart, 1976), 
giving ammunition to a conservative backlash that challenged the legitimacy of second -
wave feminist goals (equality between the sexes). Third, within criminology, the gender 
question was framed within the parameters of the liberation thesis (Howe, 1990), thereby 
marginalizing more critical challenges of criminological theories, especially those by 
feminists (Klein, 1973; Leonard, 1982; Smart, 1976). 
</p>
<p>4. ACCOUNTING FOR CRIMINAL OFFENDING PATTERNS 
</p>
<p>4.1. Dominant Paradigms 
</p>
<p>Mainstream explanations for criminal offending are drawn primarily from developmen-
tal, social learning, social (and self-) control, social strain, social ecology, and to a lesser 
extent labeling and rational choice perspectives.' Most of these approaches lay claim to 
general theory status. As such, each should be able to account for the criminality and/or 
conformity of both males and females. However, close examination reveals a lack of con-
sideration for females and their experiences. Indeed, most theorizing about crime is gen-
erated from the experiences of male subjects (whether criminals or conformists) and then 
generalized to females. Females are treated as "the other," excluded from theories except 
(perhaps) as a contrast point for males (Naffine, 1986). Few of the dominant explanations 
for crime explicitly confront the gender-ratio problem or recognize deficiencies in theory 
generalizability (Chesney-Lind &amp; Daly, 1988, p. 514; Kruttschnitt, 1996). 
</p>
<p>' Many feminist scholars have reviewed and critiqued early criminological writings about female offenders includ-
</p>
<p>ing Freud (1933), Glueck and Glueck (1934), Lombroso and Ferrero (1915), Pollack (1950), and Thomas (1907, 
</p>
<p>1923). Although it is clear that many current conceptions about female criminality may be traced to these theorists 
</p>
<p>(Chesney-Lind &amp; Shelden, 1992; Klein, 1973;Rasche, 1974;Smart, 1976), most contemporary criminological 
</p>
<p>perspectives tend to ignore females entirely while claiming to be general theories of criminality. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Crime, and Criminal Justice 545 
</p>
<p>We have too little space to devote much attention to each of these approaches (excel-
lent critiques are supplied by Chesney-Lind &amp; Sheldon, 1992; Leonard, 1982; 
Messerschmidt, 1993 and Naffine, 1986). However, a cursory review and brief feminist 
critique is warranted. 
</p>
<p>The basic premise of strain theories is that there is a disjuncture for some in society 
between positively valued goals (e.g., financial success, good jobs, social status) and the 
opportunity structures available to successfully achieve those goals. As stated by Merton 
(1938), Cohen (1955), and Cloward and Ohlin (1960), criminality is more likely to occur 
within the lower classes where legitimate opportunities are less available and illegal al-
ternatives (and criminal subcultures) are apt to arise. Theorists either failed to consider 
how their theory would account for female criminality (e.g., in Merton's theory, females 
should be more strained and hence have greater involvement in crime than males) or 
explicitly excluded females from the theoretical framework because they didn't fit. Cohen, 
for instance, suggested that females are concerned with a narrower set of issues than 
males, specifically, relations with the opposite sex. When frustrated in their goals, fe-
males resort to getting their man in immoral ways (i.e., promiscuity). Their delinquency 
was not "real delinquency" (i.e., aggressive and violent) but puny and pitiful&mdash;sexual 
and emotional (Naffine, 1986). Similarly, Cloward and Ohlin discounted females from 
engaging in "real" crime because of their domesticity&mdash;it was neither necessary nor im-
portant for females to seek either legitimate or illegitimate opportunities. The fact that 
working class and many minority women worked out of economic necessity, confronted 
employment bias on a regular basis, and still had crime rates lower than their male coun-
terparts neither illuminated nor challenged these theorists. 
</p>
<p>Social learning perspectives, including differential association (Akers, 1973; 
Sutherland, 1934) account for criminality as learned behavior. Criminality is acquired 
through a process of association and exposure to definitions favorable or unfavorable to 
the violation of law. Criminal behavior is reinforced or extinguished through the applica-
tion of rewards or punishments. While somewhat more inclusive of females than other 
theories (e.g., Sutherland suggests that gender differences in socialization and control 
account for gender differences in crime and Akers argues that sexual deviance is related 
to problems with gender identification and sex-role behavior), social learning perspec-
tives are not explicit about how gendered crime develops nor do they recognize that 
nonsexual kinds of crime, such as white-collar, are also gendered (see Chesney-Lind &amp; 
Shelden, 1992, p. 68). 
</p>
<p>Social control theory assumes that all are capable of crime. Hence, according to 
control theorists, the more interesting theoretical question to pose and answer is "Why do 
people conform?" (Hirschi, 1969, p. 10). Different versions of control theory emphasize 
different factors that produce conformity (i.e., a positive self-concept, high degree of self-
control, stakes in conformity, strong social bonds to society); yet, the fact that females are 
overwhelmingly more conforming than males has not produced theories that begin with 
this empirical truth. Instead, the delinquency of males is the empirical and conceptual 
starting point for these theories. Hirschi (1969, pp. 35-36) recognizes the duplicity in 
this approach when he drops girls from his empirical analysis and offers the following 
disclaimer: "Since girls have been neglected for far too long by students of delinquency, 
the exclusion of them is difficult to justify. I hope to return to them soon." 
</p>
<p>More recent control theory developments have a mixed record on the gender issue. 
Sampson and Laub's (1993) age-graded theory of informal control, for instance, is exclu-
sively based in the experiences of male offenders and a matched male control group of </p>
<p/>

<p>546 Sally S. Simpson AND Denise C. Herz 
</p>
<p>nonoffenders. Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990, p. 148), on the other hand, note the stabil-
ity of gender differences in rates of delinquency and suggest that such differences emerge 
early in life, "well before differences in opportunity are possible, and persist into adult-
hood, where differences in supervision by agents of social control are minimal." Conse-
quently, they theorize that the gender ratio problem is "largely the result of crime differ-
ences and differences in self-control that are not produced by direct external control" 
(Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990, p. 149, emphasis in original). Putatively, these differences 
are attributable to gender differences in children's susceptibility to socialization and pa-
rental initiative to recognize deviance and to discipline and control it. However, the au-
thors suggest that "it is beyond the scope of this work (and beyond the reach of any 
available set of empirical data) to attempt to identify all of the elements responsible for 
gender differences in crime" (149). 
</p>
<p>Developmental theories, such as those advanced by Wilson and Herrnstein (1985), 
Fishbein (1990), Moffitt (1994), and Patterson, DeBaryshe, &amp; Ramsey (1989), draw upon 
biological, psychosocial, and social factors to explain initiation and continued participa-
tion in criminal offending. Few of these authors focus exclusively on gender (an excep-
tion is Caspi, Lynam, Moffitt, &amp; Silva, 1993); yet, different rates of participation in vio-
lence between the sexes is an empirical consideration that all confront in some way. 
Moffitt (1994), for instance, proposed two distinct pathways to delinquency. The pathway 
for life-course persisters is caused by neuropsychological problems that are exacerbated 
by parental inabilities to cope with the child's special needs and subsequent problems 
with social adjustment (a developmental path similar to that proposed by Fishbein, 1990). 
Life-course persisters become serious chronic offenders, behavior that continues into adult-
hood. These offenders, Moffitt claims, are almost always male, but she offers little expla-
nation for why this is the case. The other pathway to delinquency emerges in adolescence 
and is the consequence of a maturity gap between biological maturation and the adoles-
cent desire for, but exclusion from, adult privileges. The delinquency of "adolescent-
limited" offenders is minor (e.g., status offenses such as drinking, truancy, smoking; 
minor property offending, getting into fights). The acts are a statement of defiance of, 
and "independence" from, adult authority and rules. Adolescent-limited offenders, both 
males and females, begin offending later than life-course persisters and cease offending 
in late adolescence as adult opportunities open up to them. Moreover, given the trivial 
nature of most of their delinquency, there has been no attenuation of the adolescents' 
bonds to conventional society. 
</p>
<p>While Moffitt's theory (and other developmental theories) acknowledge gender dif-
ferences in juvenile crime, there are several noteworthy problems. First, although there 
are relatively few serious offenders among female adolescents, a recent cohort study (Tracy, 
Wolfgang, &amp; Figlio, 1990) shows that black female violent crime rates are significantly 
higher than white female rates. For UCR violent offenses, black female rates are 5.5 
times those of white females. Black females are also more apt to be chronic offenders. 
Therefore, Moffitt's explanation for life-course persistent offenders is not sensitive to 
potentially important intra-gender differences in crime. Further, although data would 
support Moffitt's claims that both males and females engage in adolescent limited of-
fenses, it is not clear from her explanation how gender-specific differences would arise. 
Finally, if Moffitt's arguments are accurate, we would expect few adult females to engage 
in crime. Although gender differences in crime rates are greater in adulthood than they 
are during adolescence, adult females do engage in crime. Moffitt's theory offers little in </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Crime, and Criminal Justice 547 
</p>
<p>the way of understanding the situation of adult women and the offenses that they 
commit. 
</p>
<p>Labeling theory has generated two main arguments in criminology: deviance ampli-
fication and status characteristics. In the former, the deviant label is treated as an inde-
pendent variable such that its application influences future involvement in crime (Lemert, 
1951). In brief, the idea behind deviance amplification is that almost all engage in some 
acts of deviance (primary deviance) but, through the use of neutralizing techniques, man-
age to maintain a conformist self-image. However, when deviant acts are repetitive and 
highly visible, they are likely to come to the attention of authorities. This official reaction 
to deviance results in the application of a deviant label and the increased likelihood that 
the labeled person will incorporate that label into his or her conception of self and engage 
in further deviant acts (secondary deviance). From a feminist perspective, one of the key 
problems with these theoretical arguments rests in the presumption that primary devi-
ance is evenly distributed in society and tends to be nonserious. This prediction is chal-
lenged by the empirical reality of crime. Primary participation rates clearly vary by gen-
der (and race) and by crime seriousness. 
</p>
<p>Moving to the status characteristics argument, the theory predicts who will receive a 
deviant label (or more specifically, what category of persons are more likely be officially 
processed and hence officially labeled as a delinquent/criminal). According to Becker 
(1963), deviance is defined through the creation and application of rules (laws). Those 
who are more powerful in society create rules to control and manage the behavior of those 
less powerful. Thus, the lower class and minority members of society are more apt to have 
their behaviors criminalized and be officially labeled than upper-class and majority group 
members. Although equivocal, there is some empirical support for these predictions. 
However, the implications and failures of the theory regarding gender are clear: females 
are less powerful than males (Becker, 1963) and therefore should be labeled more often 
than are males. The empirical record fails to support this assertion. 
</p>
<p>Labeling theory has not been entirely rejected by feminists (see Chesney-Lind &amp; 
Sheldon, 1992; Leonard, 1982) because, with modification, the ideas may lead to a better 
understanding of how gender affects the patterning of crime and the juvenile/criminal 
processing of offenders (e.g., Harris's ideas about typescripting, 1977). Chesney-Lind 
and Sheldon (1992, p. 70), for instance, note that the theory has given some direction to 
those "critical of 'status offenses' and other attempts to label women as deviant." 
</p>
<p>Social ecology theories of crime, such as those of Shaw and McKay (1972), examine 
the symbiosis between the physical environment of urban areas and its human inhabit-
ants. Building on the work of Burgess (1928), who traces the development of the city 
from its core outward through a process of invasion, dominance, and succession, Shaw 
and McKay discovered that official delinquency rates followed similar developmental 
patterns. They were highest in areas near the core of the city (zones of transition) and 
successively lower in zones further from the core. Looking at the characteristics of the 
transition zones and the populations that lived there over time, Shaw and McKay theo-
rized that the physical deterioration of an area and social disorganization of the popula-
tion that lived there were linked. High rates of delinquency were symptomatic of the 
social disorganization of the area. 
</p>
<p>Although Shaw and McKay (1972) did make note of female delinquency rates in 
several cities and claimed that the female patterns, like those for males, were higher in 
the center city zones, the male rates were used throughout their works as "delinquency </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>548 Sally S. Simpson AND Denise C. Herz 
</p>
<p>rates" (Chesney-Lind &amp; Shelten, 1992, p. 63). The theory also does not address why male 
rates in some cities were generally higher and less concentrated than those for females. If 
the social ecology of a place determines offending levels, the theory has little to say about 
why rates would be different for boys and girls. 
</p>
<p>The last dominant paradigm to be discussed, rational choice, has been roundly criti-
cized by feminists in fields other than criminology (see, e.g., England &amp; Kilbourne, 1990). 
In criminology, rational choice perspectives have emerged from deterrence and economic 
explanations of crime (see, e.g., Becker, 1968; Paternoster, 1987). The general assump-
tions of the perspective include the following: (1) the criminal offender is reasoned (ratio-
nality is bounded); (2) the decision to engage in crime occurs after the offender has weighed 
the costs and benefits of his/her action; (3) the offending decision is constrained by situ-
ational conditions and individual preferences (Cornish and Clarke, 1986; Nagin &amp; Pater-
noster, 1993; Piliavin, Thornton, Gartner, &amp; Matsueda, 1986). Some models, but not all 
(see Piliavin et al., 1986), have incorporated law, norms, and values into the decision mix 
(Bachman, Paternoster, &amp; Ward, 1993; Grasmick &amp; Bursik, 1990; Paternoster and 
Simpson, 1993, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Feminists have criticized rational choice perspectives on two grounds. First, women 
are generally excluded from consideration in the theory. Second, if included, they gener-
ally fail to live up to the predictions of the theory (Friedman &amp; Diem, 1993, p. 92). In 
criminology, many of the studies that draw from a rational choice perspective either ex-
clude females from the analysis altogether (Bachman et al., 1993) or, treat gender as a 
control variable (Paternoster, 1989; Nagin &amp; Paternoster, 1993; Paternoster &amp; Simpson, 
1996) rather than pondering how the decision process may be gendered (an exception is 
Tibbetts &amp; Herz, 1996). Even in studies in which gender effects are hypothesized, they 
are viewed as secondary to "more important hypotheses" (Piliavin et al., 1986, p. 110). 
The importance of interpersonal comparisons of utility within the theory, that is, situa-
tions that occur "when an individual attempts to assess the utilities that other individuals 
would have derived from alternative social situations and tries to compare these utilities 
with the utilities that she herself will derive from these alternative social situations" 
(Friedman &amp; Diem, 1993, p. 112), which arguably are especially relevant for the way that 
women make decisions (England &amp; Kilbourne, 1990), are not considered in the models. 
</p>
<p>4.2. Feminist Challenges 
</p>
<p>From a feminist perspective, the dominant paradigms in criminology have generally failed 
the gender ratio and generalizability tests (Daly &amp; Chesney-Lind, 1988). Feminists have 
approached these failures in a number of ways. Some seek to modify the deficiencies of 
the dominant theories and/or rectify the male-centered research focus (Cernkovich &amp; 
Giordano, 1987; 1992; Giordano, Cernkovich, &amp; Pugh, 1986; Morash, 1986; Rosenbaum 
&amp; Lasley, 1990). Others have turned to liberalism and Marxism to confront the gender 
difference problem (see Messerschmidt, 1986; Moyer, 1992; Simpson &amp; Elis, 1996) or 
have looked outside of the discipline for answers&mdash;particularly to postmodern criticism 
(Cain, 1990b; Daly, 1997; Morris &amp; Gelsthorpe, 1991; Smart, 1995) and/or ethno-
methodology (Brod and Kaufman, 1994; Connell, 1987; Messerschmidt, 1993; Newburn 
&amp; Stanko, 1994; Simpson &amp; Elis, 1995; West and Fenstermaker, 1995).

</p>
<p>the knowledge gaps about female offenders and victims. Feminists accomplished a great 
deal in this first phase by (1) exposing the discipline as androcentric; (2) making female 
offenders visible; (3) uncovering institutional sexism in the way crime was studied and 
the ways in which offenders and victims were treated; and (4) problematizing female 
conformity as natural and self-evident (Gelsthorpe &amp; Morris, 1990, p. 3; Naffine, 1986; 
Young, 1996). By phase two, feminism had become more self-reflective. Problems with 
essentialism, the criticism, and in some cases rejection, of both feminist empiricism and 
standpoint feminism, and the abandonment of grand narratives (structures) shifted the 
intellectual arena for feminist criminologists. 
</p>
<p>. . . The major academic activities have been (1) to problematize the term woman as a unified cat-
</p>
<p>egory; (2) to acknowledge that women's experiences are, in part, constructed by legal and crimino-
</p>
<p>logical discourses; (3) to revisit the relationship between sex and gender; and (4) to reflect on the 
</p>
<p>strengths and limits of constructing feminist 'truths' and knowledge. (Daly and Maher, emphasis in 
</p>
<p>original, 1998). 
</p>
<p>Although feminist critiques of criminology and criminal justice have paralleled one 
another with regard to phase one research, postmodern (or phase two) challenges have 
been directed primarily toward analyses of the criminal justice sytem (especially law; see 
Smart, 1989, 1995). Conversely, phase two criminological research has adopted 
ethnomethodological explanations to account for gender differences in offending. In the 
next section, phase one and two feminist research in gender and justice is reviewed. We 
conclude this chapter with a feminist interpretation of how crime is accomplished as a 
consequence of "doing gender." 
</p>
<p>5. FEMINIST TRANSITIONS: GENDER AND JUSTICE 
</p>
<p>Reluctance to include female offenders within discussions of social control has largely been 
explained by the low representation of female offenders in the criminal justice system. In 
1995, for instance, adult female offenders composed only 9.7% of all state and federal 
prison admissions (Brown, Gilliard, Schnell, Stephan, &amp; Wilson, 1996), and in 1991, 
only 18% of juvenile offenders in all types of facilities were female (DeComo et al., 
1995). However, a closer examination of these statistics reveals at least two patterns. 
First, female offenders are institutionalized for less serious charges than male offenders 
(e.g., female status offenders were almost six times as likely as male status offenders to be 
placed in public facilities and twice as likely as male status offenders to be placed in a 
private facility in 1991; DeComo et al., 1995; Brenzel, 1983; Carlen, 1983; Dobash, 
Dobash, &amp; Gutteridge, 1986; Rafter, 1985 for historical and cross-cultural statistics). 
Second, research on women in prison and juvenile institutions indicates that these of-
fenders are disproportionately nonwhite and poor (Carlen, 1983; Dobash et al., 1986; 
Rafter, 1985). 
</p>
<p>In response to these patterns, feminist scholars have focused on several issues with 
regard to gender and social control, including (1) the relationship between informal and 
formal controls and gender (Hagan, Simpson, &amp; Gillis, 1979; Schur, 1983; Smart and 
Smart, 1978); (2) the differential sentencing of male and female offenders (Chesney-
Lind, 1973, 1986; Daly &amp; Bordt, 1995); (3) the determinants of institutionalization 
(Brenzel, 1983; Carlen, 1983; Dobash, et al., 1986; Eaton, 1986; Freedman, 1981; Worrall, 
1990); and (4) how the social control of women within the criminal justice system relates 
to their lives outside of the criminal justice system (Carlen, 1983; Eaton, 1986; Howe, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>550 Sally S. Simpson AND Denise C. Herz 
</p>
<p>1994). Research addressing these issues represents both the contributions as well as the 
limitations of feminist criminology to explain and theorize about gender and social con-
trol (Carrington, 1990, 1994; Daly, 1997; Smart, 1995). In the 1970s and early 1980s, 
feminist criminologists established a place for women in the social control literature by 
exposing the differential treatment that women received compared to men (Freedman, 
1981; Nagel &amp; Hagan, 1983; Rafter, 1985) and by analyzing how the type and amount of 
social control was determined by prevailing stereotypes or typescripts of femininity 
(Chesney-Lind, 1973,1986; Feinman, 1986; Merlo &amp; Pollack, 1995; Moyer, 1992). Femi-
nists in the late 1980s and 1990s, however, argue that these views of gender and social 
control are overly simplistic and fail to adequately address women as subjects of social 
control (Carringtom, 1994; Daly, 1997; Gelsthorpe &amp; Morris, 1990; Howe, 1994; Rafter, 
1985; Heidensohn, 1995). To fully explore more the research on females and social con-
trol, we turn next to a discussion of the prevailing themes found within this literature and 
the ways in which these themes have been affected by developments in feminist theory. 
</p>
<p>5.1. Sexualization, Domesticity, and Medicalization 
</p>
<p>Sexualization, the ideology of domesticity, and medicalization dominate discussions of 
female offenders and social control and serve as guiding posts to theorizing how the 
criminal justice system has defined and reacted to female offenders historically as well as 
currently. Each of these themes is linked to two fundamental elements found in feminist 
interpretations of social control: patriarchy and the ideology of separate spheres. Since 
the 1960s, feminists have argued that the subordination of women and the devaluation of 
femininity is rooted in a culture and social structure dominated by male power. Patriar-
chy, in turn, creates and perpetuates the ideology of separate spheres, which not only 
distinguishes the private (i.e., family) from the public sphere (i.e., employment) but also 
designates women as responsible for the former (e.g., wife and mother) and men for the 
latter (e.g., breadwinner). 
</p>
<p>Patriarchy and the ideology of separate spheres specifically lay the foundation for 
controlling women's sexuality and for viewing women in terms of domesticity by creat-
ing images of true womanhood (Feinman, 1986; Freedman, 1981; Moyer, 1992). Prior to 
the late nineteenth century, women were often regarded as evil and were closely con-
trolled by the church and the community for even the slightest acts of transgression (Dobash 
et al., 1986; Merlo &amp; Pollack, 1995). Following the rise of capitalism and the ideology of 
separate spheres, women were redefined in terms of femininity (i.e., true womanhood). 
Good women, or Madonnas, internalized Victorian standards of sexuality and were ex-
pected to be good mothers, submissive wives, and moral guardians of the home, whereas 
bad women, or whores, blatantly disregarded these roles and were considered evil (Feinman, 
1986; Moyer, 1992). 
</p>
<p>True womanhood became synonymous with the "nature" of women toward the end 
of the nineteenth century; consequently, explanations for female criminality switched 
from describing female offenders as "bad" to "mad" (Klein, 1973). Female offenders 
who, by definition, did not emulate the standards of good wives and mothers, were de-
clared sick and in need of rehabilitation.^ This pathological view of the female offender 
</p>
<p>^ Female offenders charged with more traditional, masculine offenses were still considered evil but beyond rehabili-
</p>
<p>tation (Rafter, 1985). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Crime, and Criminal Justice 551 
</p>
<p>continued throughout the twentieth century, firmly establishing the idea that female of-
fenders need medical (i.e., psychiatric) attention more than their male counterparts 
(Chesler, 1972; Dobash et al., 1986; Ehrenreich &amp; EngUsh, 1978; Klein, 1973; Phillips 
&amp; DeFleur, 1982; Rafter, 1985; Smart, 1976); however, the medicalization of female 
criminal behavior was often reserved for middle and upper-class women while their work-
ing-class counterparts faced criminalization more often (for a specific example of this 
class difference, see Abelson's historical analysis of shoplifting, 1989). 
</p>
<p>The application of these themes within research on gender and social control de-
pends largely on the theoretical framework and feminist perspective being used in a par-
ticular study. A review of both the processing and imprisonment literatures highlights the 
different ways in which these themes have contributed to feminist interpretations of gen-
der and social control within the criminal justice system. 
</p>
<p>5.2. Women and Sentencing 
</p>
<p>One of the more well-researched areas related to gender and social control is the process-
ing of adult and adolescent female offenders. This research indicates that female offend-
ers receive different treatment than their male counterparts in certain situations, but whether 
this treatment is harsher or more lenient seems dependent upon the age of the offender 
and the type and quality of the data used (Daly, 1987b). These factors also determine the 
extent to which sexualization, domesticity, and medicalization are related to social con-
trol decisions. Research on the arrest and processing of female adolescent offenders, for 
instance, attributes harsher penalties for female offenders to the control of sexual behav-
ior and a double standard of morality (Campbell, 1981;Chesney-Lind, 1973,1986; Mann, 
1984; Shacklady-Smith, 1976), whereas more lenient sentences for adult female offend-
ers is often explained by an offender's allegiance to the ideology of domesticity and her 
parental role (Carlen, 1983; Daly, 1987a; Eaton, 1986; Steffensmeier, Kramer, &amp; Streifel, 
1993). 
</p>
<p>Conclusions regarding the treatment of female offenders often depends on the meth-
odological rigor of these studies. Although early studies on the processing of status of-
fenders found harsh treatment for female offenders (see, e.g., Chesney -Lind, 1973), stud-
ies that controlled for relevant legal variables and that were conducted after the Juvenile 
Justice Delinquency Prevention Act in 1974 found less support for the differential treat-
ment of offenders by gender (Bishop &amp; Frazier, 1992; Johnson &amp; Scheuble, 1991; Teilmann 
&amp; Landry, 1981; for a discussion of subtle/indirect effects, see Bishop &amp; Frazier, 1992; 
Zatz, 1987). Conversely, sentencing research consistently indicates that adult female of-
fenders receive lighter sentences than male offenders (for reviews of this literature see 
Dale &amp; Bordt, 1995; Nagel &amp; Hagan, 1983; Steffensmeier et al., 1993) despite the changes 
in sentencing procedures (Nagel and Johnson, 1994; Steffenmeier et al., 1993) and the 
methodological limitations inherent in sentencing research (see Daly &amp; Bordt, 1995; 
Hagan &amp; Bumiller, 1983; Steffensmeier et al., 1993). 
</p>
<p>Several theoretical explanations have been offered to explain these findings. The 
chivalry/paternalism hypothesis is arguably the most longstanding explanation for the 
differential treatment of women and girls at all stages of the criminal justice process. 
Both chivalry and paternalism attribute lenient treatment to the attitudes and perceptions 
that male officials hold toward women. These officials view females as incapable of crimi-
nality owing to their feminine nature and attempt to shield or protect female offenders </p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>from the harshness of the criminal justice system (Anderson, 1976; Moulds, 1980). Yet, 
paternalism and the need to protect female offenders can also result in harsher treatment 
for female offenders (i.e., institutionalization) in an attempt to protect female offenders 
from themselves (Nagel &amp; Hagan, 1983), 
</p>
<p>Extensions of the chivalry/paternalism hypothesis include the evil woman hypoth-
esis and typescripting theory (Harris, 1977; Nagel &amp; Hagan, 1983). The evil woman 
hypothesis attempts to explain harsher treatment for female offenders compared to male 
offenders by proposing ". . . that women will be more harshly sanctioned because their 
criminal behavior violates sex stereotypical assumptions about the proper role of women" 
(p. 115). Typescripting theory expands the evil woman hypothesis by suggesting that 
females engaging in behavior consistent with stereotypes of female crime (e.g., shoplift-
ing) will receive equal or lesser amounts of formal social control compared to males. On 
the other hand, females engaging in behavior consistent with stereotypes of male crime 
(e.g., murder) will receive more social control and will be more likely to be viewed in 
pathological terms relative to males (Harris, 1977; Harris &amp; Hill, 1986; 1977; Philhps &amp; 
DeFleur, 1982; Visher, 1983). 
</p>
<p>Another theoretical framework used to explain the differential treatment of male 
and female offenders is Black's (1976) assumption that formal social controls vary indi-
rectly with informal controls. Based on this proposition, sentencing decisions depend on 
the number of individuals on whom an offender is dependent, since these relationships 
represent the amount and strength of informal controls. Kruttschnitt (1982, 1984) then 
integrated this proposition with the idea that informal controls play a more significant 
role in women's lives than on men's to support the contention that informal controls will 
be more influential in sentencing decisions for female offenders. Although she found 
support for the influence of informal controls for female offenders in her early research 
(1982, 1984), additional studies found few consistent patterns over time and no convinc-
ing gender effects related to the influence of informal controls (i.e., the influence of infor-
mal controls seems to affect both male and female pretrial and sentencing decisions; 
Kruttschnitt &amp; Green, 1984 and Kruttschnitt &amp; McCarthy, 1985). 
</p>
<p>Unsatisfied by the explanatory power of paternalism and informal controls, Daly 
(1987a) interviewed several criminal justice officials in an attempt to learn why gender 
differences may emerge in the course of 'doing justice' " (p. 267). Daly's interviews re-
vealed that leniency was not necessarily related to the dependency of the offender on 
others but rather the dependency of others on the offenders (e.g., children and/or a spouse). 
In other words, defendants who were "familied" were more likely to receive a more le-
nient sentence than those who were "nonfamilied" (see also Eaton, 1986). Further, offi-
cials felt that women in the familied category (as long as they were good mothers) de-
served greater leniency than familied men because their responsibilities were consistent 
with gender role expectations. Thus, Daly replaced paternalism with familial paternal-
ism, arguing that court officials are more concerned with preserving the family (espe-
cially from a social cost perspective) than with protecting women from the system (Daly, 
1987b, 1989a, 1989b). 
</p>
<p>Steffensmeier and associates (1993) then extended familial paternalism to the no-
tion of "blameworthiness" to explain disparate sentencing found within the sentencing 
guideline structure in Pennsylvania. "Blameworthiness" incorporates both the familied 
position of the female offender and her motivation for the crime. Stealing money to feed 
her children will result in less blameworthiness than a single woman stealing for greed. 
Daly (1994) also found that individual cases were scrutinized closely and that "women's </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Crime, and Criminal Justice 553 
</p>
<p>biographies were constructed more often than men's with a theme of 'blurred boundaries' 
between victimization and criminalization" (Daly, 1994, p 163). Such biographies often 
led to different interpretations of the female offender in relation to her blameworthiness. 
Less blameworthiness and greater optimism in the potential to reform a woman, in turn, 
often resulted in less serious sentences for female offenders. 
</p>
<p>Differences in the treatment of female offenders ultimately leads to a discussion of 
sentencing disparity as warranted or unwarranted. Different treatment may be appropri-
ate in light of the differences between men and women in offending patterns and in their 
societal responsibilities. Thus, uncritical acceptance of the equal treatment model is prob-
lematic. It assumes that the circumstances and actions that bring men and women to 
court are comparable, thereby perpetuating the notion that men represent the standard 
with which to compare women rather than viewing female offenders as subjects in and of 
themselves (Daly, 1994, 1995). It further assumes that harsher sentences are better for all 
offenders&mdash;a highly debated issue. Finally, the equal treatment model obscures gender 
interactions with race and class (Daly, 1989a; Gruhl, Welch, &amp; Spohn, 1984; Spohn, 
Welch, &amp; Gruhl, 1985), the severity of responses over time, jurisdiction variations, and 
discussion as to whether these sentences are just (see Daly, 1994, p. 163 and Nagel &amp; 
Johnson, 1994 for more discussion of these issues). 
</p>
<p>In the same light, gender cannot be discarded from these discussions since seem-
ingly neutral criteria, such as family and offender motivation, can still be gendered (see 
Daly, 1987a and Steffensmeier et al., 1993). Although family is heavily considered for 
both male and female defendants, children often have a greater impact on female defen-
dant decisions because (1) females appearing before the court tend to have children more 
often than do male defendants; (2) being responsible for children is more consistent with 
role expectations for women than it is for men (i.e., men are traditionally the breadwin-
ners of a family); and (3) such responsibilities signify greater reform potential. 
</p>
<p>Despite the contributions that this literature has made to understanding the relation-
ship between gender and social control, critics suggest that it is limited in at least two 
respects. First, this literature has been dominated by quantitative analysis, which, in turn, 
has discouraged the use of other analytical techniques such as discourse analysis and case 
study approaches (for critiques and exceptions, see Daly, 1994,1997; Eaton, 1986; Howe, 
1994; Worrall, 1990). Second, its focus on sentencing obscures the inseparable relation-
ship between processing decisions and the institutionalization of female offenders (Carlen, 
1983). To address the interrelated nature of sentencing and institutionalization, we turn 
next to a review of the literature on gender and institutionalization. 
</p>
<p>5.3. Gender and Institutionalization 
</p>
<p>Critical studies of gender and institutionalization arguably began in the 1970s when re-
searchers explored the treatment of female adolescent offenders relative to their male 
counterparts&mdash;especially status offenders. These studies consistently found that far more 
female than male offenders were charged with and institutionalized for these offenses 
(Brenzel, 1983; Odem, 1991 Rafter, 1985; Schlossman &amp; Wallach, 1978). Each of these 
studies attributed this differential treatment, in large part, to a double standard of moral-
ity for male and female offenders (i.e., the "sexualization thesis"). Carrington (1990), 
however, questions this longstanding reliance on paternalism and the sexualization the-
sis to explain such treatment. She points out that these explanations are essentialist. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>554 Sally S. Simpson AND Denise C. Herz 
</p>
<p>ignoring the influence of race and class on juvenile justice decisions, as well as discus-
sions of wider social welfare issues that justify juvenile justice control over female sexu-
ality (Carrington, 1990, 1994; see also Gelsthorpe, 1986 and Odem, 1991). Further, 
Carrington argues that the sexualization processes that operate within the juvenile justice 
system have been invoked primarily by mothers or female social workers rather than by a 
patriarchal family or male magistrate. Odem (1991), for example, discusses how poor 
single mothers in Los Angeles accessed the juvenile justice system to control their daugh-
ters' immoral and uncontrollable behavior. Gordon (1988) made a similar observation 
with regard to the regulation of child abuse and neglect in Boston at the turn of the 
century, and Chesney-Lind (1973, 1986; Chesney-Lind and Sheldon, 1992) noted the 
relationship between status offense referrals and a mothers' frustration with daughters 
whom they feel are uncontrollable (e.g., dating a boy of whom the mother does not ap-
prove). Thus, the sexualization thesis falls short of providing an accurate reading of the 
juvenile justice system's control of female delinquency. Such shortcomings require the 
"de-essentialization" of gender in feminist readings and the interpretation of sexualiza-
tion within a variety of relevant discourses (Carrington, 1990; Gelsthorpe, 1986; Odem, 
1991). 
</p>
<p>The ideology of domesticity and the sexualization of female offenses has also been 
used to explain the differential treatment of adult female offenders. In her history of 
women's imprisonment from 1870 to 1910, Estelle Freedman (1981) proposes that chang-
ing roles of women dramatically affected the ways in which female offenders were viewed 
and treated. Middle-class women became advocates for the redefinition of the female 
criminal, separate facilities for women offenders, and the rehabilitation of their working-
class "sisters" according to the middle-class notions of domesticity and true womanhood. 
As a result, women's reformatories became a place in which working-class women were 
trained to perform domestic tasks and to become the moral protectors of the home. Freed-
man suggests that the development of separate institutions benefitted women prisoners 
but concedes that the treatment of women inmates, compared to male inmates, perpetu-
ated the sexual inequalities found within a paternalistic society. Differential treatment, 
such as domestic rather than academic training, rehabilitation based on the internaliza-
tion of traditional moral standards expected of a woman, incarceration for moral rather 
than criminal behavior, and indeterminate sentencing serve as the basis for Freedman's 
call to abolish the double standard of morality and to acquire equal services for women in 
prison. 
</p>
<p>In Partial Justice (1985), Nicole Rafter expanded upon Freedman's work by pre-
senting a socialist feminist interpretation of the history of women's imprisonment. Spe-
cifically, she focused on the relationship between race, gender, and class and social con-
trol. Rafter stresses the widening divisions between social classes and the need to control 
a growing working class throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as criti-
cal factors in the establishment of women's reformatories. The goal of these reformato-
ries for women was to rehabilitate them by controlling their sexuality and providing them 
with domestic training. By controlling their sexuality, middle-class women reinforced 
changes in gender roles, maintained the interests of a patriarchal society, and reified their 
own values and standards of true womanhood. By controlling the vocational training of 
women inmates, middle-class reformers supplied a cheap work force to a growing class of 
middle- and upper-class women. 
</p>
<p>Not all women offenders were placed in reformatories. Rafter identifies the develop-
ment of a bifurcated system of social control: reformatories for white, minor offenders </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender, Crime, and Criminal Justice 555 
</p>
<p>and traditional, custodial prisons for women who committed more masculine types of 
crime and African-American women, who were classified as beyond reform. Based on 
her skin color, an African-American offender was perceived as the " . . . deceitful Dark 
Lady who, behind her apparent femininity, hid opposite traits: self-centeredness, the abil-
ity to scheme and use cunning, . . . and voracious sexuality" (p. 181). According to Rafter, 
both the differential treatment of female offenders and this bifurcated system of control 
obscure the issue of equal treatment for female and male offenders. 
</p>
<p>Dobash et al. (1986) built on Rafter's and Freedman's work by focusing on the de-
velopment of women's prisons in England and Scotland and by approaching this devel-
opment from a Foucauldian perspective. They argued that women prisoners were and are 
controlled, watched, and manipulated more than male prisoners via the therapeutic model 
and a network of institutions specifically created for female prisoners (e.g., refuges and 
reformatories). Dobash et al. addressed the widespread influence of the myth that female 
offenders are mentally ill on both penal ideologies and prison policies. Consequently, this 
myth creates the assumption that all female prisoners need psychiatric treatment and 
redefines the prison and prison staff in therapeutic terms. Ironically, however, Dobash et 
al. argued that despite the rhetoric of therapy contained within penal ideology, principles 
of discipline and punishment prevailed. 
</p>
<p>Following their therapeutic experience in prison, female inmates were often encour-
aged, and sometimes required to spend additional time in a refuge or reformatory (espe-
cially prostitutes and idle and neglectful women). Similar to the United States, these 
institutions were established in an effort to provide paternalistic guidance to prevent a 
woman from sliding back into a life of sin and crime. A comparable network of social 
control was not created for male prisoners, who were released upon the completion of 
their sentence. Thus, medicalizing the deviant behavior of women, defining it in sexual-
ized terms, and strict adherence to the ideology of domesticity seem to encourage the 
differential treatment of offenders by gender, which often translated into more far-reach-
ing control of women's lives than men's. 
</p>
<p>These historical accounts of women's imprisonment contribute significantly to our 
understanding of gender and social control but also serve as examples of the gaps still 
found in this area of research. Not only do these studies rely on traditional methodologies 
(e.g., comparative analysis) rather than questioning masculinist approaches and develop-
ing feminist methodologies (Howe, 1994), but they also illustrate how the social control 
of women is influenced by stereotypical images of femininity and traditional role expec-
tations without presenting theoretical ideas that would require a paradigm shift in the 
way we view the social control oflfemale offenders. Research on the contemporary use of 
social control responds, to some extent, to these limitations by using different approaches 
to theorize about gender and social control. 
</p>
<p>Carlen (1983), for example, takes a standpoint feminist approach to women's im-
prisonment. She interviewed 20 female inmates and several members of the prison staff 
at Cornton Vale in Scotland to uncover the relationships between the biographies of women 
prisoners and the discourses that constitute them, both in the courtroom as well as in 
prison. Carlen argued that discourses of family are used to evaluate the worthiness of 
women defendants. Regardless of the offense, good mothers and wives often receive com-
munity-based sanctions, whereas women who seemingly reject the ideology of the family 
receive imprisonment. Court and prison officials view these women as having the appro-
priate social control mechanisms in their lives but being beyond their control (i.e., 
"outwith"). Once imprisoned, they are defined in pathological terms and controlled via </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>556 Sally S. Simpson AND Denise C. Herz 
</p>
<p>notions of family and femininity; however, the contradictions inherent in prison dis-
course and action render these women failures at womanhood. Having been " . . . rejected 
in penal discourse as 'real prisoners', rejected by hospital alcoholic units as being with-
out motivation; rejected by social workers as being outwith reform and beyond help; and 
rejected by psychiatrists as being outwith treatment and beyond cured" (p. 155), these 
offenders represent the women that no one wants. 
</p>
<p>Worrall (1990) is specifically interested in how court officials and psychiatric ex-
perts construct and control women offenders who do not fit into stereotypes by 
deconstructing the ways in which those in power construct "knowledged" about these 
offenders. Worrall contended that officials and experts normalize the "female conditions 
of existence" through discourses of domesticity, sexuality, and pathology. Magistrates 
interpret atypical female defendants within these discourses, solicitors use these discourses 
to represent their clients as "normal" women, psychiatrists assess their mental health 
within these discourses, and probation officers describe and react to them within these 
discourses. Ironically, female offenders who feel powerless and confined within these 
discourses reject them by "doing contradictory things and exploiting the contradictions of 
the gender contract" (p. 161), thereby increasing the extent to which discourses of do-
mesticity, sexuality, and pathology are used to control and ultimately oppress them. 
</p>
<p>Both Carlen's and Worrall's studies problematize the model of equal treatment even 
further than the sentencing literature because they expose its contradictory meaning. This 
model presumes that equality in law and criminal justice treatment rectifies the dispari-
ties between male and female offenders; however, the model of equal treatment does not 
necessarily help women offenders because it neither acknowledges nor addresses gender-
based inequality inherent within the larger social structure. Rather, the current state of 
unequal treatment potentially serves to reinforce traditional roles and expectations of 
women, especially for poor women, by using ideologies of sexuality, domesticity, and 
pathology to determine the type and amount of social control a woman will receive and 
the type and amount of training women offenders will receive when imprisoned. 
</p>
<p>Taken together, research on gender and sentencing and gender and imprisonment 
illustrates a slow progression from describing social control in paternalistic terms to a 
deconstruction of the "knowledge" used to define and assess women offenders. This re-
search does not mark the end of the story, however. As Howe points out, "In sum, feminist 
analysts of the punishment of women still have a considerable way to go. They may have 
come to recognize that women's prisons are . . . of theoretical interest.... But they have 
not taken what might be called the project of theorisation very far" (p. 159). Specifically, 
they have yet to fully address feminist questions about research methodologies, to explain 
how women's criminal careers are circumscribed by gender, to explore wider issues re-
lated to the social control of women, and to explain the ways in which race and socioeco-
nomic status impact the use of social control. Feminists need to expand their analyses to 
include postmodern interpretations of law, penality, and social control (e.g.. Smart, 1995; 
Worrall, 1991) and also to expand the bounds within which we understand the social 
control of women. In other words, our challenge as feminists exploring the social control 
of women is to develop a methodological framework separate from traditional masculinist 
approaches from which we can deconstruct the social control of women from not only 
their experiences within the criminal justice system but also from the " . . . the private 
prisons of docile yet rebellious bodies, drugged and tranquillized bodies, famished self 
policing bodies in which many women live their lives, 'free' of penal control" (Howe, 
1994, p. 207). </p>

</p>
<p>6. GENDER, CRIME, AND JUSTICE: FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS 
</p>
<p>One promising direction for tlie study of gender, crime, and justice has emerged from 
work in ethnomethodology (Connell, 1987; West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1995; West &amp; 
Zimmerman, 1987). Linking social structures (e.g., division of labor, power relations, 
and sexuality) with individual experience and the situated accomplishment of gender, 
Messerschmidt (1993, p. 84) described the ways in which crime (which is overwhelm-
ingly enacted by males) is "simply one practice in which and through which power over 
women can be naturalized." Differently situated males share with other men a construc-
tion of masculinity that is unique to their structural position in society. Hence, "different 
types of masculinity exist in the school, the youth group, the street, the family, and the 
workplace" (Messerschmidt, 1993, p. 84). The accomplishment of masculinity within 
these venues will differ according to the types of resources that are available to the males 
within them. Crime is a means of accomplishing masculinity when other resources to do 
so are limited. 
</p>
<p>There are several benefits to theorizing about masculinities and crime: (1) it nor-
malizes the aggressive and violent behavior of men; (2) it situates male behavior in the 
context of unequal power relations with men; and (3) because gender is viewed as an 
accomplishment&mdash;as "a practice," masculinity and femininity are not essentialized 
(Newburn &amp; Stanko, 1994, pp. 3, 4). The convention in this body of work is to focus on 
masculinity; however, as more recent work by Messerschmidt (1995) and Simpson and 
Elis (1996) demonstrates, the accomplishment of gender and its relationship to crime is 
not an exclusively masculine process. Doing gender does not require crime and, in fact, 
"emphasized femininity" (Connell, 1987) may negate the practice of most kinds of crimes 
for females (Simpson &amp; Elis, 1996). However, accomplishing femininity through crime 
as, say, a "bad girl" in a gang, also draws on and affirms the ways in which gender 
relations are accomplished (Messerschmidt, 1995). Thus, the approach helps to untangle 
the sex-ratio problem while also accounting for female conformity and/or criminality. It 
can also accommodate race and class differences with the notion of hegemonic and subor-
dinated masculinities.-' 
</p>
<p>Other feminists are less enamoured with ethnomethodological approaches. They ei-
ther find the nonessential argument unconvincing (see, e.g., Collins, et al., 1995) or find 
the primary focus on masculinity disconcerting and ironic given the past exclusion of 
women from criminological theorizing (Chesney,Lind, 1995, pp. 85, 86). Others worry 
that the approach has been inappropriately theorized (i.e., using masculinity to theorize 
femininity) and quantified (Daly, 1997). 
</p>
<p>Based on some of these philosophical and epistemological divisions, it is unclear 
where feminist criminology is heading. Some critics suggest that the only way to trans-
form criminology is to abandon it completely. Howe (1990, p. 7), for instance, argues that 
criminology is "beyond reclamation." Morris and Gelsthorpe (1991, p. 5) believe that the 
discipline is impoverished and have "looked elsewhere . . . to where feminists rather than 
criminologists are working for help in understanding and making sense of our work." 
Smart (1995, p. 32) casts an even dimmer view by characterizing phase one research as 
</p>
<p>' Doing gender is employed by Martin and Jurik (1996) to account for the accomplishment of gender in the occupa-
</p>
<p>tion of justice (policing, law, and corrections). Maherand Daly (1996) highlight how notions of masculinity (and 
</p>
<p>ethnicity) permeate the illicit drug economy and contribute to the exclusion of women from lucrative opportunities 
</p>
<p>in drug selling and distribution networks. </p>

<p>"misdirected" and suggesting that "the core enterprise of criminology is problematic." 
These views emerge primarily from postmodern challenges (Smart, 1995; Young, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Others, however, are more optimistic about the discipline, in part because they rec-
ognize some of the limitations of postmodern analysis (see Schwartz &amp; Friedrichs, 1994 
for an excellent review and critique of postmodern thought and criminology) or because 
their version of postmodernism renders the discipline "limited" and therefore amenable 
to feminist viewpoints (Young, 1996, p. 49). Carlen (1990), for instance, suggested that 
deconstruction is a useful analytical tool but that the privileging of feminist discourses 
over earlier "Truths" is a potential threat. Moreover, she took as given empirical realities 
that must be confronted by feminist criminologists (see also, Cain, 1990a). [In this, she 
draws from Harding (1986, p. 301) who argues that the dualisms rejected by postmodernism 
may be empirically false but "we cannot afford to reject them as irrelevant as long as they 
structure our lives and our consciousness."] One reality is that women are involuntarily 
processed and held by the criminal justice system. Feminists need to "suggest principled 
ways in which the criminal justice and penal systems might become more women-wise" 
(Carlen, 1990, p. 109). Cain (1990b, p. 6) offers a threefold strategy to "transgress" 
criminology through reflexivity, deconstruction, and reconstruction. Reflexivity is a strategy 
in which feminists recognize the real concerns of girls and women and the discourses 
that shape those concerns. Once recognized, it is necessary to deconstruct the internal 
illogic of the discourse and the manner and sites in which it is deployed. Finally, feminist 
criminology must help girls and women to move beyond the painful experience of living 
the dominant discourse (reconstruction). All of this involves female-centered research 
(so that women will not be compared to men); stepping outside of the discourse of crimi-
nology to understand how females live their lives (because criminological discourses have 
lead nowhere and we need to connect offenders, victims, and the criminal justice system 
to a broader picture); and ultimately, to "reintroduce men" into the study of crime, law, 
and criminal justice institutions because gender is a relational concept and the failure to 
do so repeats the essentialism trap (Cain, 1990b, p. 11). 
</p>
<p>Our own views are somewhat mixed on the feminist criminological enterprise. As 
empirical realists (Cain, 1990) and structuralists, we are uncomfortable with the rejec-
tion of social scientific knowledge (see also, Daly, 1997) and social structure. While 
postmodernism has added a compelling set of ideas to the study of crime and justice, we 
do not see exactly where postmodern interpretations will lead us. At the risk of being 
labeled equivocators, we argue for a middle ground. The investigation of gender, crime, 
and justice can only benefit from varied and diverse epistemologies and theoretical frame-
works.

<p>Gender and the Military 
</p>
<p>MADY WECHSLER SEGAL 
</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>The military is an important social institution, with effects on other institutions and on 
people's lives, both directly and indirectly. Despite this, the military is a relatively ne-
glected area of study within sociology. Further, though the military has a gender-defming 
tradition and gender is endemic in the institution, central works on the sociology of 
gender usually omit analysis of gender in the military. This neglect of study on armed 
forces is partly due to anti-military views of many sociologists, especially feminists, and 
to lack of knowledge of military organization (the latter despite the role of the military in 
the development of organizational theories, including centrality in the work of Max We-
ber, 1968). This chapter may help to fill this gap and integrate the study of gender in the 
military into the larger field. 
</p>
<p>This chapter describes and analyzes the literature on gender in the military. Of spe-
cial interest from a macrosociological perspective are historical and current trends in 
women's participation in the armed forces of the United States and other nations and the 
factors that affect them. At the micro-level, the emphasis is on the integration of women 
in armed forces and the social construction of gender in interpersonal interactions. While 
the literature, and therefore this chapter, focus on women in the military, other related 
topics are considered. The central role of gender in the military&mdash;and the role of the 
military in defining gender in the larger society&mdash;have implications for men's behaviors 
and for men's and women's views regarding policies on women's military roles and on

<p>homosexuality in the armed forces. The construction of gender in military family issues 
is also discussed. One can study nearly every topic of previous chapters in this volume 
within the context of the military and in public discourse about the military. One can 
apply concepts from those areas to the study of gender and the military&mdash;as sociologists 
working on these issues in the military have done. 
</p>
<p>2. WOMEN IN THE MILITARY AS AN AREA OF STUDY 
</p>
<p>Until the 1970s, there was almost no scholarly work on women in the military (other than 
Treadwell, 1954). Research and public policy attention has increased dramatically over 
the past 20 years. Part of the reason for this increase has been an expansion of women's 
military roles in the United States and most European nations (as described later). 
</p>
<p>The literature and the "invisible college" tend to be interdisciplinary, with the major 
research and/or writing being done by political scientists (such as Enloe, 1983, 1993; 
Stiehm, 1981, 1989, 1996), historians (including Campbell, 1992, 1993; De Pauw, 1981), 
anthropologists (such as Rosen of Rosen, Durand, Bliese, Halverson, Rothberg, &amp; Harrison, 
1996), psychologists (including Thomas, 1986), journalists (e.g., Rogan, 1981) and mili-
tary personnel with various backgrounds and generally without social science training 
who write about their personal experiences (e.g., Barkalow, 1990; Earley, 1989). One of 
the most comprehensive works on women in the U.S. armed forces that provides a de-
tailed history of policy changes was written by Holm (1992), the first American woman to 
attain two-star flag rank (as a Major General in the Air Force). 
</p>
<p>The number of sociologists doing research on women in the military (and on gender 
in the armed forces more generally) has been increasing, to include Devilbiss (1985) on 
gender integration and group cohesion, Firestone and Harris (1994) on sexual harass-
ment. Miller (1997) on gender harassment, and Moore (1991, 1996, 1997) on African-
American and Japanese-American women in the military. Some of our knowledge comes 
from sociologists who have written dissertations on the military that they have later pub-
lished as books. Examples are Rustad's (1982) work on the integration of women into an 
Army signal unit in the late 1970s and Williams' (1989) book on women marines and 
male nurses. 
</p>
<p>There is increasing coverage in our journals and in book chapters of women in the 
armed forces of other nations (e.g., Cherpak, 1993; Chinchilla, 1990; Cock, 1994; Dandeker 
&amp; Segal, 1996; Seitz, Lobao, &amp; Treadway, 1993). However, this work tends to cover just 
one nation at a time and therefore not to be truly comparative. Theory building using a 
multinational perspective has just begun (Segal, 1995). (Except where indicated, analysis 
in this chapter refers to the United States.) 
</p>
<p>3. THE MILITARY AS A GENDER-DEFINING INSTITUTION 
</p>
<p>Current events have created a media frenzy of coverage and attention to problems of 
</p>
<p>gender integration, such as the recent sexual assault and harassment scandal at Aberdeen 
</p>
<p>Proving Ground or the earlier Tailhook scandal. Such coverage leads to the false impres-
</p>
<p>sion that the problems revealed (such as sexual harassment) are new or newly known. 
</p>
<p>Despite this impression, these issues have been present in daily interactions of military 
</p>
<p>personnel for some time; they have just now been brought to the public's attention by </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and the Military 565 
</p>
<p>intense media pressure. This pressure has also created organizational responses that ex-
ceed responses to previous indications of widespread sexual harassment (such as revealed 
by surveys conducted by the Department of Defense in 1988 and 1995). 
</p>
<p>To understand these dynamics, as well as women's past, current, and future military 
roles, requires an understanding of the role of gender in the military and of the role of the 
military in cultural constructions of gender. 
</p>
<p>Some literature analyzes the military as a gender-defining institution and socializ-
ing agent. The older literature in this tradition emphasizes the role of the military in 
creating or reifying masculinity among men through their processing by the organiza-
tion. Serving in the military historically has been a rite of passage from boyhood to man-
hood. The importance of "masculinity" in this transition is especially apparent in the 
culture of basic training, where new recruits are exhorted to try harder or be labeled 
"girls" or "sissies" (Arkin &amp; Dobrofsky, 1978; Paris, 1976; Williams, 1989). 
</p>
<p>This gender-defining function of military service has been undergoing change as the 
proportion of women in uniform has risen and as more jobs, including many combat and 
combat support specialties, have been opened to women. But strong resistance to inte-
grating women in the military institution can be seen in public policy discourse and in the 
everyday interactions of military personnel (as I explore in depth later in this chapter). 
One source of this resistance is the traditional role of the military in defining masculinity. 
Recognizing this role is important to analyzing the current situation for gender in armed 
forces. Recent works on the masculine military culture focus on the problematic nature of 
this culture for women's integration (e.g., Katzenstein &amp; Reppy, 1999). 
</p>
<p>Despite institutional resistance and the prototypical male nature of the institution, 
women have participated in the armed forces of the United States and many other nations 
through history and their roles have been expanding. I turn now to a cross-national analysis 
of women's military participation. Then I will look at women's military history and con-
temporary role in the United States. 
</p>
<p>4. WOMEN'S MILITARY PARTICIPATION CROSS-NATIONALLY 
</p>
<p>AND THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT IT 
</p>
<p>The cross-national study of women in the military is in its infancy. There are large gaps 
</p>
<p>in our knowledge. However, there are some generalizations that appear warranted by the 
</p>
<p>available literature, especially about the conditions under which women's military roles 
</p>
<p>expand or contract. Military variables affecting the nature and extent of women's partici-
</p>
<p>pation include characteristics of the nation's security situation and certain aspects of 
</p>
<p>military organization and activity. Social structural factors include aspects of women's 
</p>
<p>civilian roles and more general civilian social structural variables that affect women's 
</p>
<p>roles. Cultural processes, such as the social construction of gender and family roles, also 
</p>
<p>influence women's participation in armed forces. (For a thorough description of these 
</p>
<p>variables, see Segal, 1995.) 
</p>
<p>4.1. Military Situation 
</p>
<p>Of major importance in determining women's military roles in a society is the security 
situation of the society. When there are shortages of qualified men, especially during </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>566 Mady Wechsler Segal 
</p>
<p>times of national emergency, most nations have increased (and will increase) women's 
military roles. Under some conditions, women have participated in combat; more often, 
their noncombat military functions increase. Many nations currently conscript men, but 
few require women to serve in the military; furthermore, where women are drafted, the 
conditions of their obligation often differ from those of men. Women have been con-
scripted in the past during wartime&mdash;and are likely to be again in the future. Examples of 
conscription during the World War 11 era (including actual conscription and laws allow-
ing conscription) can be found in France, Greece, Norway, Germany, and the United 
Kingdom (Goldman, 1982; Stanley &amp; Segal, 1988; Treadwell, 1954). In the United States 
had the war in Europe not ended, civilian nurses would have been drafted (Holm, 1992; 
Treadwell, 1954). 
</p>
<p>Whether or not they conscripted women, nations have greatly increased their par-
ticipation (in terms of both numbers and roles) during wartime: marked examples of this 
in many nations were evident during World War II. Although women were still concen-
trated in a few job classifications, wartime necessity opened other jobs to them (e.g., 
Binkin &amp; Bach, 1977; Holm, 1992; Treadwell, 1954). 
</p>
<p>A common pattern is the active involvement of women in revolutionary movements. 
Women have been in partisan and guerilla operations, including as combatants, in, for 
example, Algeria, China, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Rhodesia, Russia, Vietnam, Yugosla-
via, and the U.S. Revolutionary War; however, after the guerrillas have overthrown the 
government and formed a new one with a more conventionally organized armed force, women 
return to more traditional social roles and leave the military&mdash;voluntarily or not (Cherpak, 
1993; De Pauw, 1981; Enloe, 1980; Goldman, 1982; Isaksson, 1988; Randall, 1981, 1994; 
Segal, Li, &amp; Segal, 1992; Seitz, Lobao, &amp; Treadway, 1993; Stanley &amp; Segal, 1992). 
</p>
<p>Similarly, the end of World War II saw a return to limitations on women's military 
jobs. In the United States, laws passed in 1948 placed restrictions on military women. 
When women are no longer needed, their military activity is reduced. Women have served 
as a reserve labor force, both civilian and military (Campbell, 1984; Enloe, 1980; Gluck, 
1987). 
</p>
<p>Women's military roles are socially constructed; public policy, norms, and women's 
behavior are shaped, at least in part, by public discourse. What has happened in the past 
in many nations is that when the armed forces need women, their prior military history is 
recalled to demonstrate that they can perform effectively in various positions. Subse-
quently, there is a process of cultural amnesia of the contributions women made during 
emergency situations. In the aftermath of war, women's military activities are recon-
structed as minor (or even nonexistent), allowing the culture to maintain the myth "of 
men in arms and women at home" (Cooke, 1993, p. 178). When a new emergency arises, 
history is rediscovered. 
</p>
<p>Women's involvement in armed forces (even as combatants) tends to be high when 
there is grave threat to the society, regardless of cultural values about gender. There are 
times when women's military involvement may be seen as an extension of women's roles 
as mothers protecting their children; such may be the case in partisan activities of women 
drawn from the ranks of the poor, especially during times of severe oppression (Chin-
chilla, 1990; Li, 1993, 1995; Montgomery, 1995; Randall, 1981). 
</p>
<p>In societies with low threats to national security but with cultural values supporting 
gender equality, women's military participation also increases. Contemporary examples 
include Canada and Sweden, which allow women to volunteer for combat jobs (Segal &amp; </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and the Military 567 
</p>
<p>Segal, 1989; Stanley &amp; Segal, 1992; Tornquist, 1982). In Canada, even ground combat 
positions are open to women. 
</p>
<p>The extent of women's participation in combat jobs seems to be minimized when 
there is a medium threat, that is, when the society is not threatened with imminent ex-
tinction or invasion by superior military forces, but there is a moderate to high probability 
of military action on its soil in the near future. This description has been applicable to 
Israel, where until recently women were excluded from serving in combat. 
</p>
<p>The nature of military missions also affects the degree of women's participation. 
The greater the relative importance of actual war fighting (especially ground combat), 
the less the participation of women. Women's participation is greater when military forces 
are engaged in peacekeeping operations or disaster relief activities, as well as in opera-
tions that resemble domestic police functions (such as drug interdiction and quelling civil 
disturbances). The recent rise in frequency of these types of operations may bring in-
creased representation of women in uniform. Women can also be expected to be increas-
ingly involved in military aviation&mdash;even in war fighting, as evidenced by the opening of 
fighter pilot positions to women in several nations (e.g., Canada, the Netherlands, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States) (Dandeker &amp; Segal, 1996; Dorn, 1994; Segal &amp; 
Segal, 1989; Stanley &amp; Segal, 1988). 
</p>
<p>In general, modern nations that have voluntary systems of recruitment of military 
personnel (notably Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States) have been in-
creasing women's military roles more rapidly than those with conscription. Demographic 
patterns also play a role here when combined with voluntary accession. Israel conscripts 
both men and women, but places strong limitations on women's military positions; con-
trary to popular mythology, Israeli women have not been allowed to participate in combat 
(Bloom, 1982; Gal, 1986) until very recently, and then only as the result of a lawsuit. 
</p>
<p>4.2. Social Structure 
</p>
<p>4.2.1. DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS. Demographic patterns shape women's roles in vari-
ous ways. They affect women's use as a reserve source of labor (Campbell, 1984; Gluck, 1987; 
Kessler-Harris, 1982). When the supply of men does not meet the demand for military labor, 
women are drawn into service. Thus, when small birth cohorts reach military age, unless 
there is a concomitant decrease in demand for military personnel, opportunities for women 
in the armed forces seem to increase. This impact has been evident in most of the NATO 
nations in the past 20 years, including the United States in the 1970s (Segal &amp; Segal, 1983) 
and the United Kingdom in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Dandeker &amp; Segal, 1996). 
</p>
<p>4.2.2. LABOR FORCE CHARACTERISTICS. Various labor force characteristics affect 
women's military roles. As the proportion of women employed has increased in many 
nations, their representation in the armed forces has also increased. This occurs partly 
because the same factors affect both activities (such as a shortage of male labor) and 
partly because women's greater involvement in the workplace brings structural and cultural 
changes in the society that make military service more compatible with women's roles&mdash;and 
makes excluding them from military service less justifiable. Such changes have been evident 
in, for example, the Scandinavian countries and the United States over the past 20 years 
(e.g., Stanley &amp; Segal, 1988; United Nations, 1991). Women's labor force participation </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>568 Mady Wechsler Segal 
</p>
<p>in France has also been increasing and so have movements toward increasing their repre-
sentation in the armed forces (Boulfegue, 1991; Hantrais, 1990). The percentage of women 
in the labor force in the United Kingdom has been relatively lower and their military 
roles have been limited; both are now increasing (Dandeker &amp; Segal, 1996). 
</p>
<p>The degree of gender segregation in the civilian occupational structure also affects 
women's military participation, although the relationship is not linear. When sex segre-
gation is extremely high, the military must rely on women to perform military functions 
that are dominated by women in the civilian workplace. This is why the United States 
recruited women civilian telephone operators in World War I (Holm, 1992; Schneider &amp; 
Schneider, 1991). Nursing is another job that tends to be sex typed as a woman's job, 
which has led the militaries in many countries to allow women to serve; indeed, nursing 
has often been the first military job to open to women in substantial numbers. In general, 
however, sex segregation in the civilian labor market is negatively related to women's 
military participation. A more gender integrated occupational structure is indicative of 
more gender equality in the culture, which in turn leads to greater acceptance of women 
in military roles. Further, if women's civilian occupations are similar to men's, then 
women are more likely to have skills required for military jobs. 
</p>
<p>4.2.3. ECONOMIC FACTORS. The state of the civilian economy affects women's civil-
ian and military employment. In periods of economic expansion, women are drawn into 
employment. In contracting economies, women tend to leave the workforce. High unem-
ployment rates (especially among young men) are associated with a ready supply of men 
to serve in the armed forces and relatively low opportunities for women in the military. 
Periods of low male unemployment, especially with volunteer militaries, sometimes lead 
to expanded military roles for women (and women more motivated to join, especially if 
they are relatively disadvantaged in the civilian economy). In the United States, major 
growth in the representation of women in the military occurred in the late 1970s, when 
unemployment declined. When unemployment rose in the early 1980s, the expansion 
stalled (Segal &amp; Segal, 1983). 
</p>
<p>4.2.4 FAMILY ROLES. Family roles affect women's military participation in two ways. First, 
there is a strong tendency in most cultures for women's roles generally to be intricately linked 
to family values and norms. Second, the nature of military activity is socially constructed in 
many cultures as negatively related to family roles (M. Segal, 1986, 1989). 
</p>
<p>There are several family structural variables that affect women's military roles. 
Women's participation in the military is positively associated with later age at first mar-
riage, later age at birth of first child, and fewer children. The average age at onset of 
family responsibilities is even more important for women's military roles than for civil-
ian employment because of the emphasis on youth for military personnel. In those na-
tions where there has been a delaying of family formation there has also been an increase 
in women's representation in the military (examples are Canada and the United States in 
the 1970s and 1980s) (Stanley &amp; Segal, 1988). 
</p>
<p>4.3. Culture 
</p>
<p>4.3.1. SOCIAL VALUES ABOUT GENDER. The meaning of gender is socially constructed. 
</p>
<p>The degree to which people are assigned to social roles on the basis of gender, and the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and the Military 569 
</p>
<p>particular roles that are seen as appropriate to each gender, are socially determined&mdash;far 
beyond the impact of biologically based determinants (Lorber, 1993). A division of labor 
based on sex may have been functional for the society in earlier times, but is clearly less 
so now (e.g., Marwell, 1975). To the extent that individual traits for which there are large 
average differences by sex are important for the organization of activities, a sex-based 
division of labor may be functional. Technology has diminished the importance of two 
types of physically based traits, namely physical strength and reproduction. 
</p>
<p>What is important for this chapter is the way in which the culture deals with gender 
differences. A culture can exaggerate or minimize the importance of sex differences (in 
physical or psychological traits) and thereby justify or reject a gender-based division of 
social roles. Thus, I am concerned not with what is "correct" in any objective or eviden-
tial sense. Rather, I look at the discourse about gender, the importance attached to gender 
differences, and the implications for women's roles (including in the armed forces) of the 
cultural interpretation of gender. Cultures can stress gender equality or differences be-
tween the genders and this has strong impacts on women's military roles. The greater the 
emphasis on ascription by gender (and therefore the less the emphasis on individual 
differences), the more limited women's military role. 
</p>
<p>Each society can go through cultural changes in gender roles and such changes are 
not always linear, but are often cyclical. The causal direction of the link between culture 
and structure is not always clear. Sometimes cultural change drives structural change. At 
other times, structural changes (such as women moving into predominantly male jobs) 
are caused by other factors (such as war) and then the culture changes to justify structural 
changes (Anderson, 1981; Campbell, 1984; Kessler-Harris, 1982). When the structure 
changes again, so can the culture (as happens after a war). 
</p>
<p>Analysis of women's military roles benefits from examination of this process of the 
social construction of gender&mdash;and the analysis of the social construction of women's 
military roles adds to our knowledge of the social construction of gender in general. For 
example, one can analyze the public discourse about women's military roles for the un-
derlying constructions of gender and rationales for policy positions (Segal &amp; Hansen, 
1992). (Similar analysis can be done on public discourse about the relationship to mili-
tary service of other characteristics, such as race or sexual orientation.) Chafetz points 
out in Chapter 1 of this volume that "virtually all macro-level feminist theories agree that 
cultural or ideological definitions of masculinity/femininity and of gender 'appropriate' 
behaviors, responsibilities and privileges, are fundamental components of systems of gender 
inequality." Such cultural definitions can be seen very clearly in policy discourse about 
gender in the military (as well as in gender interactions in military organizations, as we 
shall see later in this chapter). 
</p>
<p>There are some interesting examples from World War II of the social construction of 
women's military roles, including several of women performing functions that are con-
sidered military in other societies but are labeled civilian. Germany conscripted women 
into what were labeled as civilian jobs; although many women wore uniforms, were un-
der military authority, and performed functions considered military in other nations, they 
were called civilians (Tuten, 1982). In the United Kingdom, even uniformed women were 
defined as noncombatants. The definition of the line between combatant and noncomba-
tant involved the firing of weapons. Women performed all tasks associated with the firing 
of anti-aircraft weapons except the actual firing: they moved ammunition and even loaded 
the weapons, but, to continue to view them as noncombatants, they were not allowed to 
fire the weapons they had loaded (they had to get a man to do it!) (Campbell, 1993). In </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>570 Mady Wechsler Segal 
</p>
<p>the United States, the WASPs (Women's Airforce Service Pilots) ferried military planes&mdash; 
and 38 were killed in the line of duty&mdash;but were treated as civilians. Congress granted 
them military veterans benefits in 1977 (Holm, 1992), an example of reconstruction of 
social status. 
</p>
<p>The cultural contradictions and ideological ambivalence involved in women's mili-
tary participation can be seen in the reactions of both those who favor maintenance of 
patriarchal values and radical feminists (Chapkis, 1981; Elshtain, &amp; Tobias, 1990; Enloe, 
1980). Those at both ends of the ideological spectrum on gender roles oppose having 
women serve in armed forces. Having large numbers of military women causes public 
resistance because it challenges notions of masculinity and femininity (Enloe, 1993). 
</p>
<p>The more egalitarian the social values about gender, the greater women's represen-
tation in the military. On the other side, cultures that support traditional divisions of 
labor based on gender tend to exclude women from the military or limit their roles sub-
stantially. As social values have become more egalitarian in societies, women's military 
roles have expanded. The citizenship revolution has been expanding to previously disen-
franchised social groups. During this century, many nations have enfranchised women in 
the political system&mdash;and cultures increasingly have supported their participation in other 
social institutions (such as the economy). A driving force toward increasing women's 
representation in the military has been laws prohibiting discrimination based on gender 
(which sometimes apply to the military). For example, Canada's Human Rights Law has 
been directly responsible for breaking down some barriers to women's full participation 
in the armed forces (Park, 1986; Segal &amp; Segal, 1989; Stanley &amp; Segal, 1988). The 
European Community is undergoing some similar effects of gender discrimination laws 
(Dandeker &amp; Segal, 1996). 
</p>
<p>It is not yet clear how far social values will go toward full gender equality. Given the 
traditionally masculine nature of the military institution, it is one of the last bastions of 
male domination and there are forces resistant to gender integration. Substantial seg-
ments of many societies' populations remain more traditional. One force for traditional 
gender roles that limit women's representation in the military may be religious funda-
mentalism or conservatism, with tenets that place men and women in separate spheres of 
life (and confine women to the family) (Hawley, 1994). 
</p>
<p>4.3.2. SOCIAL VALUES ABOUT FAMILY. The social construction of family also needs to 
</p>
<p>be considered because women's social roles are affected by anything having to do with the 
</p>
<p>family. Women's historically primary societal function has been associated with repro-
</p>
<p>duction and child rearing. The extent to which a culture continues to assign women this 
</p>
<p>primary role affects women's military roles. Cultures often see the mothering role as 
</p>
<p>antithetical to the warrior role; giving life in childbirth is seen as the opposite of taking 
</p>
<p>life in war. In addition, the long dependence of young children on adult caretakers (tradi-
</p>
<p>tionally mothers) has precluded those caretakers from participating in activities that take 
</p>
<p>them away or require their uninterrupted attention (such as hunting or war). 
</p>
<p>As conceptions about family and the structures of families have changed, so have 
</p>
<p>cultural expectations about women's devotion to family&mdash;and their inclusion in wider 
</p>
<p>social roles increases. Social values about family in many societies have been supportive 
</p>
<p>of family forms that differ from traditional structures. The greater the cultural acceptance 
</p>
<p>of various family structures, the less everyone is expected to fit one pattern, and the less 
</p>
<p>gender determines social roles. 
</p>
<p>The greater the movement away from certain traditional family forms, especially </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and the Military 571 
</p>
<p>those based on the nuclear family, the greater the representation of women in the military. 
This does not mean the demise of family values, but a transformation in the structures 
that support such values. Indeed, included here can be government-sponsored parental 
leave and/or community supported child care that enables parents to be involved in their 
societies without neglecting children. Extended families of various kinds are also more 
compatible with women serving in the military (and in civilian employment separated 
from family) than are isolated nuclear families. To the extent that societies support di-
verse family forms, women are more likely to participate in the military. 
</p>
<p>4.3.3. INTERSECTIONS OF RACE AND GENDER. Connections between race or ethnicity 
and gender play a role in determining social policy with regard to the military in some 
countries (Enloe, 1980). For example, women gained representation in the white South 
African Defense Force owing to political aims of the white elite (Cock, 1994). In the 
United States, comparisons are often made between racial integration of the armed forces 
and gender integration (D. Segal, 1989); however, there are historical eras in which 
white women and African-Americans were alternative sources of military labor, such as 
when civilian nurses were about to be drafted because of a shortage of military nurses, 
while black nurses were subject to quotas and were prohibited from treating white service 
members (Hine, 1989). 
</p>
<p>The current percentage of military women who are African-American is extraordi-
narily high. While African-American men are overrepresented among enUsted personnel 
(compared to their percentage in the population), the overrepresentation of African-Ameri-
can women is even higher among enlisted women and among officers is almost double 
the percentage of male officers who are African-American. The percentage of enlisted 
women who are black is especially high in the Army: 47% (compared to 27% of enlisted 
men) (Department of the Army, 1997). This overrepresentation is due primarily to the 
relative advantages in pay and benefits of military service compared to opportunities in 
the civilian labor market. 
</p>
<p>5. WOMEN IN THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES: 
</p>
<p>PAST AND PRESENT 
</p>
<p>5.1. History 
</p>
<p>Women's involvement in American wars dates back to the revolution (De Pauw, 1981). In 
the twentieth century, in response to the demands of World War I, women were employed 
by military forces in both nursing and non-nursing capacities in unprecedented numbers. 
The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps estabhshed women's units in 1917 and 1918, respec-
tively. The uniformed women were granted military status and were assigned to jobs 
women normally held in civilian society, such as telephone operator and clerk; some were 
stationed overseas (Holm, 1992; Schneider &amp; Schneider, 1991). Since these units were 
established to meet specific personnel needs to free men for combat, the units were tem-
porary and the women were demobilized after the war. 
</p>
<p>In World War II a major shift occurred in the nature of women's military participa-
tion. Not only did they serve in large numbers, but their roles expanded. Large numbers 
of women were employed in civilian industry essential to the war effort, as well as in 
uniformed military service (Campbell, 1984; Gluck, 1987; Holm, 1982; Treadwell, 1954). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>572 Mady Wechsler Segal 
</p>
<p>Women's organizations were formed for all services, with their original designations 
implying their intended temporary nature (e.g., Women's Army Auxiliary Corps). Al-
though women were mainly assigned to traditional fields, as the war progressed women's 
activities expanded beyond the usual roles women play (health care, administration, and 
communications) to include technical and combat support jobs. Small numbers served in 
almost every specialty, excluding direct combat, including as airplane mechanics, para-
chute riggers, and weapons instructors. 
</p>
<p>American women were prohibited from serving as offensive combat personnel, but 
they were deployed to foreign theaters and were involved in espionage and sabotage ac-
tivities. They were thus exposed to danger. Nurses stationed in the Philippines and Guam 
were taken prisoner by the Japanese, and others were captured by the Germans. 
</p>
<p>Had the war not ended in 1945, civilian nurses in the United States would have been 
drafted. The bill to conscript nurses had been passed by the House and had cleared the 
Senate committee (in March 1945). The termination of the war in Europe in May 1945 
reversed the shortage of military nurses that had led to the need for conscription. 
</p>
<p>As in other nations after World War II and other wars, the end of the war saw a 
return to limitations on women's military roles. Legislation passed in 1947 and 1948 
provided for continuing women's armed services but severely limited military women's 
numbers and activities. As in other areas of social life in the United States following 
World War II, women were expected to return to more traditional statuses and roles 
(Campbell, 1984). Despite some modification of these laws in the 1960s and 1970s, 
American women's military roles were constrained by exclusions prescribed by this leg-
islation for more than 40 years. These laws prohibited women in the Air Force, Navy, and 
Marine Corps from being assigned to duty on aircraft or combat ships engaged in combat 
missions. There were exceptions to these exclusions for physicians, nurses, chaplains, 
and attorneys. The Army had no statutory prohibition against women in combat, but a 
policy was developed and modified over the years to prevent women from being assigned 
to units or jobs in which they would routinely be engaged in close combat. These exclu-
sions, however, did not protect women from the risk of exposure to combat. Women in the 
Air Force were prohibited from flying fighter planes but were permitted to fly tankers, 
which would be targets in the event of war. Navy women served on support vessels, such 
as supply ships, which are also likely targets. Women in the Army served in military 
police, mechanical repair, transportation, intelligence, signal, and other support special-
ties that would bring them into battle. 
</p>
<p>Despite the combat restrictions and the lack of wartime necessity, the representation 
of women in the military increased dramatically in the 1970s. At the start of the All 
Volunteer Force (AVE) in 1973, there were shortages of qualified men. Congress had 
passed the Equal Rights Amendment in 1972 and there was anticipation that it would be 
ratified by the states. The combined effect of these two occurrences was to open job spe-
cialties to women from which they had been excluded previously and to increase the 
number of women recruited into the armed forces. In 1971 there were approximately 
43,000 women in uniform (30,000 enhsted and 13,000 officers), constituting only 1.6% 
of total active-duty military personnel. By the end of 1980, 9 years later, there were about 
173,000 women, or about 8.5 % of total active duty forces. 
</p>
<p>The expansions in women's military roles have led to greater likelihood that women 
would be involved in military engagements and in roles that are not "traditional" for 
women. In December 1989, women participated in the U.S. invasion of Panama during 
"Operation Just Cause." Approximately 800 of the 18,400 soldiers involved in the opera-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and the Military 573 
</p>
<p>lion were women (Moskos, 1990). Their roles were varied and included piloting helicop-
ters to ferry troops&mdash;some while under enemy fire from the ground. 
</p>
<p>The missions and experiences of some of the women soldiers involved in the Pana-
manian operation fueled a renewed debate about women in combat. For example, there 
was controversy surrounding whether a military police captain was in combat when she 
led her unit in attempting to capture a military dog kennel believed to be occupied by 
armed and firing members of the Panamanian Defense Forces. 
</p>
<p>However, attention to the participation of women in Operation Just Cause pales by 
comparison with media coverage and potential policy impact of the roles played by women 
in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Approximately 41,000 women were de-
ployed to the Persian Gulf between August, 1990 and February, 1991 (Eitelberg, 1991). 
Women made up about 7% of all military personnel deployed (including all ranks and 
active duty and reserve personnel combined). The Army accounted for the vast majority 
of these women. 
</p>
<p>One of the interesting aspects of women's representation in the Persian Gulf opera-
tions was the difference between active duty and reserve forces, especially among offic-
ers. While women were 5.6% of active enlisted personnel in the theater of operations, 
they were 12.2% of reserve enlisted forces. The contrast is even more marked among 
officers: 7.3% of active duty officers were women, compared to 21.3% of reserve officers. 
</p>
<p>The experiences of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm demonstrate that the 
policy excluding women from offensive combat roles does not provide complete protec-
tion from death or capture: 13 American women were among the 375 U.S. service mem-
bers who died and two women were prisoners of war (Eitelberg, 1991). 
</p>
<p>The public attention to women's successful performance in their jobs in the Gulf 
War increased political pressure to remove barriers to women in combat. It clearly led 
directly to repeal by Congress (in 1992) of the 1948 law prohibiting women in combat 
aircraft and contributed to the opening of naval combat ships (in 1993). 
</p>
<p>5.2. Contemporary Representation 
</p>
<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, women's representation in the U.S. armed forces continued to 
rise, although at a slower rate than in the 1970s. Change was not linear: there were 
periodic reversals of policy, such as opening then closing of certain occupational special-
ties to women (see Stiehm, 1989 for a discussion of "backlash" in the early 1980s). By 
1997, the approximately 196,000 women in the Department of Defense military services 
(and about 3000 in the Coast Guard, which is part of the Department of Transportation) 
were about 14% of active duty forces. Their representation was highest in the Air Force 
(17.8% of enlisted personnel and 16.2% of officers) and lowest in the Marine Corps 
(5.4% of enlisted personnel and 4.4% of officers) (WREI, 1998, using data from Defense 
Manpower Data Center). 
</p>
<p>Differences among the services in the proportion of women are due primarily to the 
differential occupational distributions in the services. Since women are excluded from 
some combat positions, the larger the number of such positions there are in a service, the 
fewer the number of women the service can admit. The absence of medical personnel in 
the Marines (which gets its medical support from the Navy) contributes to the smaller 
percentage of women in the Corps than in the other services. 
</p>
<p>As of 1994, 99.7% of all positions in the Air Force are open to women; those that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>574 Mady Wechsler Segal 
</p>
<p>remain closed are those that collocate with direct ground combat positions that exclude 
women (Dorn, 1994; WREI, 1996, 1998). In the Navy, 94% of all positions (96% of 
occupations) are open to women; exclusions include submarines, SEAL (special forces) 
units, and support positions (such as medical and chaplain) that collocate with Marine 
Corps units from which women are barred. Women are permitted in 70% of Army posi-
tions (91% of occupations); they are barred from serving in the direct ground combat 
battalions and any support units that collocate with them; positions closed to women 
include infantry, armor, special forces, field artillery battalions, combat engineer compa-
nies, and forward area air defense artillery. Similarly, 62% of the positions in the Marine 
Corps (93% of occupations) are open to women; women are barred from positions in the 
infantry regiments and physically collocated support units and positions. (All positions 
in the Coast Guard are open to women.) 
</p>
<p>Although women do tend to serve in occupational areas that are traditional for women 
in the services, substantial numbers serve in other areas. About half of enlisted women 
serve in the two most traditional areas of support and administration (33.0%) and health 
care (15.6%); 46.5% of women officers serve in health care positions, while 14.9% are in 
administrative positions (WREI, 1998). 
</p>
<p>Examination of women's distribution among military ranks reveals that their repre-
sentation in the junior and middle pay grades is roughly proportional to their concentra-
tion in each service. Women are substantially underrepresented in the senior ranks, espe-
cially among officers (WREI, 1996), but their proportion in the senior ranks has been 
increasing (WREI, 1998). 
</p>
<p>5.3. Contemporary Process of Gender Integration 
</p>
<p>As can be seen from all of the information given earlier, we know a great deal at the 
macro-level about women's participation in armed forces, including laws, policies, the 
policy development process; the literature on women's military history has been growing, 
both in the United States and other nations. When we get to the micro-level of interper-
sonal relations, our knowledge is less systematic. While there are some works that de-
scribe women's personal experiences in the military (e.g., Barkalow, 1990; Barley, 1989) 
and social scientific studies that document problems in gender integration (e.g.. Miller, 
1997; Rustad, 1982), there has not been as much theory building and testing concerning 
the conditions under which gender integration is more or less successful. Research does 
provide the basis for such theory development and one can learn much about gender 
processes in general from this research. 
</p>
<p>As women's roles in the U.S. military increased over the past two decades, and as 
women entered previously all-male jobs and situations, interpersonal processes of funda-
mental social change were evident in the attitudes and behaviors of the men and in the 
experiences of the women. Organizational resistance and interpersonal adjustments are 
still prevalent, although acceptance of women has increased in many military situations 
and is in some settings more routine and even routinized. 
</p>
<p>There is substantial documentation of the initial process of gender integration at the 
service academies: the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air 
Force Academy, and the Coast Guard Academy (e.g., Adams, 1984; DeFleur &amp; Warner, 
1987; Durning, 1978; Priest, Vitters, &amp; Prince, 1978; Safilios-Rothschild, 1978; Stiehm, 
1981). Women first entered the academies in 1976 (with women first graduating in the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and the Military 575 
</p>
<p>class of 1980) as a result (except for the Coast Guard) of Congressional mandate. Male 
cadets and midshipmen, who tended to hold traditional rather than egalitarian sex role 
attitudes, were hostile to the admission of women&mdash;not unlike their contemporary coun-
terparts at The Citadel and Virginia Military Institute (VMI), which have just begun 
gender integration following a court battle waged to keep their schools all-male. Re-
search on West Point shows that upperclass cadets exerted a negative socialization influ-
ence on the attitudes of men in the first gender-integrated class (as well as in the previous 
year's class). Researchers at all the academies found that behavior toward the women was 
well described by Kanter's (1977) work on responses to "token" women. Such behavior is 
still a common experience for women at the academies, despite more than 20 years of 
integration and a rise in their representation (recent classes at West Point are approxi-
mately 16% women; at the Coast Academy, women are about one-third of recent entering 
classes). However, acceptance of women has improved and it now no longer makes the 
news when women hold top leadership positions. 
</p>
<p>In all military settings there is an active process of "doing gender" (West &amp; 
Zimmerman, 1987); social construction and role negotiation around gender is common. 
Indeed, because women in many of these settings violate men's conceptions of gender-
appropriate behavior (sometimes even by their mere presence), much attention is paid to 
gender. Women often constitute a small proportion of their work groups and experience 
the kind of behavior from the men that Kanter (1977) describes. 
</p>
<p>Despite the prevalence of reactions to the "token" women, not all research supports 
Kanter's notions about the effects of group proportions. Dunivin (1988), for example, 
studying Air Force officers, finds that while women's perceptions of the opportunity struc-
ture in their jobs are significantly different from men's, women's attitudes in the most 
skewed specialties (e.g., pilots and air traffic controllers) actually resembled their male 
peers' views more than did women in some specialties with relatively higher concentra-
tions of women (e.g., administrators). There are other indications that reactions to women 
become more seriously negative when their proportions rise, their opportunities within 
the organization improve, and they constitute more of a threat to men's career advance-
ment&mdash;in a manner similar to what Blalock (1967) described for acceptance of minority 
racial groups as a function of the size of the subgroup within the group. 
</p>
<p>5.3.1. GENDER HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT. Women in the military are 
particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment owing to the skewed gender ratios, the fact 
that military personnel often live in close quarters together, and the power involved in the 
rank hierarchy. While sexual assault is rare (though present) (Morris, 1996), certain 
kinds of sexual harassment are quite common, especially behaviors such as sexually ex-
plicit comments and jokes and suggestive looks and gestures (Department of Defense, 
1995; Firestone &amp; Harris, 1994; Martindale, 1990). 
</p>
<p>Researchers are starting to pay attention to gender harassment and to distinguish it 
from sexual harassment. Miller (1997) shows that forms of gender harassment in the 
Army include resisting women's authority, constant scrutiny of women and using any 
mistakes as evidence of military women's inferiority, gossip and rumors, sabotage of 
women's work (such as their equipment), and indirect threats. Also quite common are 
sexist remarks, including statements that women do not belong in the military. 
</p>
<p>An important component of gender relations in the military has to do with percep-
tions of inequity. It is not clear whether these perceptions are the cause or the result of 
sexist attitudes, but the consequences of the perceptions are significant regardless of their </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>576 Mady Wechsler Segal 
</p>
<p>cause or even their veracity. One source of such perception of inequity in the Army is the 
physical fitness test that all soldiers must pass and which has different standards by age 
and sex. Since a woman can pass the test with a performance for which a man would fail, 
many male soldiers believe that women are given an unfair advantage. Interestingly, such 
concerns are rarely voiced with regard to differential standards by age. 
</p>
<p>Perceptions (by both men and women, military and civilian) that women are inferior 
to men physically lie at the base of opposition to women being allowed in some military 
jobs, especially ground combat. This is evident in public and private discourse about the 
issue (Miller, 1997; Segal &amp; Hansen, 1992). But such opposition is also due to desires to 
maintain the gender-defining role of military service. 
</p>
<p>Perceptions of inequity and inequality in physical performance are reinforced by the 
nature of the physical fitness test and the application of standards by gender. The test was 
initially designed to measure men's physical fitness efficiently and with limited equip-
ment; it consists of pushups, situps, and a timed run. Physical traits on which women, on 
average, would outperform men (such as measures of flexibility) are not included in the 
test. Women are being judged by traits on which average men score higher than average 
women. Military women sometimes judge themselves by the male standards (just as men 
judge them) and therefore feel less worthy. 
</p>
<p>Military women generally do not consider themselves "feminist" even when their 
beliefs are quite feminist. This is partly because they have been socialized by a male-
dominated culture that views "feminism" as antithetical to military, just as "feminine" is 
antithetical to military. Some military women, especially enlisted women, want to main-
tain distinctions between men and women. For example, some Army enlisted women 
oppose opening ground combat roles to women because they want to be different from the 
men (that is, they do not want to be warriors) and they want to be seen as different from 
men; that is, they want to maintain their self-definitions as feminine despite being sol-
diers. Women officers are more likely to favor opening combat roles to women partly 
because they recognize that continued exclusion serves to maintain systematic gender 
inequality (Miller, 1995). 
</p>
<p>It seems that at the very time when the role of the military has been evolving, toward 
more operations other than war, such as peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, there 
are increasing pressures to reassert the masculinity of the service member. As the military 
changes in adaptation to its likely role in the twenty-first century, forces for tradition are 
resisting changes that they have defined as the "feminization" of the military." The pres-
sures and resistance can be seen not only in interpersonal relations (including gender and 
sexual harassment), but also in the political arena&mdash;as evidenced by attempts in Congress 
to force basic military training to be gender segregated (Maze, 1997). This reassertion of 
masculinity may also be seen in policies and public discourse regarding homosexuality. 
</p>
<p>6. HOMOSEXUALITY IN THE MILITARY 
</p>
<p>Exclusion of homosexuals is another way to maintain the military as a province of hetero-
</p>
<p>sexual males with gender-defining characteristics. There appears to be a relationship 
</p>
<p>between the degree to which a nation's policies allow homosexuals to serve in the mili-
</p>
<p>tary and the extent of gender integration in its armed forces (Segal, Segal, &amp; Booth, 
</p>
<p>1999). The United States is an outlier in that it has a relatively high degree of gender 
</p>
<p>integration, but excludes open homosexuals from serving. In 1993, newly elected Presi-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and the Military 577 
</p>
<p>dent Clinton attempted to lift the ban. Instead, after much public debate, Congress adopted 
a "Don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue" policy with regard to homosexuality . Since then, 
the number of discharges for homosexuality has actually risen and women are dispropor-
tionately affected. The policy has been challenged in the courts and some cases are still 
being heard, which may take the issue to the Supreme Court. (For social scientific analy-
ses of the issues involved, including comparisons with gender and racial integration, see 
Herek, Jobe, &amp; Carney, 1996; Scott &amp; Stanley, 1994.) 
</p>
<p>7. GENDER AND MILITARY FAMILY ISSUES 
</p>
<p>IN THE UNITED STATES 
</p>
<p>Family issues often arise in public debates about women in the military because women 
are seen as the primary caretakers of children. Most research on military families focusses 
on male service members and their wives. This is not surprising, given the predominantly 
male composition of armed forces and the historical exclusion of women with children. 
Women with children were first allowed to remain in service in the 1970s. It is important 
for sociologists to examine all the ways that gender plays a role in family issues in the 
military: for military men, for military women, and for civilian spouses of both genders. 
</p>
<p>The "greedy" nature of military life creates demands on service members and their 
families. Civilian wives of military men have traditionally been expected to accommo-
date their lives to these demands. Changes in gender norms in the wider society have 
been affecting military families and military family policy. (For a full analysis of these 
changes, see M. W. Segal, 1986, 1989; Stanley, Segal, &amp; Laughton, 1990.) Social defini-
tions of gender affect marital expectations, interactions, and role negotiations. The rise in 
military wives' labor force participation has altered military families' adjustments to 
military lifestyle characteristics, such as frequent moving. 
</p>
<p>Military family patterns are now more diverse. The number of single parents and 
dual-service couples has grown in the past two decades and they have received both 
research and policy attention. There tends to be negative attention in policy debates, such 
as assumptions that they have more trouble than other personnel in meeting their military 
and family obligations, an assumption that tends not be supported by research (e.g., Segal 
&amp; Harris, 1993). Civilian husbands of military women, although increasing in proportion 
of military spouses, have been neglected both in policy attention and in research. Bourg 
(1995) shows how their experiences reflect their token status. 
</p>
<p>8. GENDER AND THE MILITARY: THE FUTURE 
</p>
<p>There will be continued public debate and social change in the United States and other 
nations about gender in the military, including women's roles, policy with regard to ho-
mosexuality, and family issues. Public policy discourse still reflects pockets of resistance 
to change and a desire by some to go back to more limited military roles for women. This 
is evident, for example, in the recent attempt by some members of Congress to require the 
services to segregate the sexes in basic training. Although the attempt was not immedi-
ately successful, study groups were set up to examine the issue and report back. 
</p>
<p>Women's past military roles have not increased linearly, but rather have gone through 
cycles of expansion and contraction. Cultural ambivalence exists in the United States and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>578 Mady Wechsler Segal 
</p>
<p>other nations; the issues are likely to continue to be the focus of political conflict. As in 
the past, women's military roles will be affected both by social definitions of gender and 
military needs. With the end of the Cold War, the nations of North America and Western 
and Eastern Europe are making dramatic changes in their military missions and force 
structures&mdash;with implications for gender. Sociologists will find interesting processes at 
both the macro- and micro-levels to study, which could help to fill the gaps in our knowl-
edge about gender&mdash;both in the military and more generally.

<p>Gender and Sport 
</p>

</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION 
</p>
<p>Sport is a useful arena in which to study gender and society. Since ancient times, men 
have used sport to separate themselves from women by restricting women from partici-
pating in games and contests and by using those events to emphasize physical size and 
strength. In examining the ways men have used sport to exclude women, some scholars 
conceptualize sport as a mirror of society; sport structures reflect other institutions that 
benefit men, such as work and political structures (Sabo &amp; Runfola, 1980). Sport can also 
act as an archetype for masculinity. When sporting events turn into spectacle, as is true 
for most major competitions today, they transform masculine symbols and behaviors into 
public ritual. 
</p>
<p>Despite this masculine orientation toward sport, women and girls have also played 
recreational and competitive sport for centuries: Women have wrestled in Gambia, Nige-
ria, and the Congo, boxed in the South Pacific, played ball games in North America, and 
women ran and threw the javelin in ancient Greece. During the Renaissance, women 
hunted, golfed, raced, and played in ball games at festivals. Even Victorian women, dis-
couraged from participating in unladylike competition, engaged in light exercise designed 
to make them more fit for motherhood (Cahn, 1995; Guttman, 1991). During World War 
II, talented female athletes in the United States played in professional baseball leagues 
(Weiller &amp; Higgs, 1994). Nevertheless, while it is true that women played sports, they did 
so under the constraints of gendered domestic roles, ideas of femininity, and the primacy 
of men's sports. The World War II baseball players, for example, enjoyed enthusiastic

<p>support for their athletic endeavors&mdash;until the men returned from war, took up their bats 
again, and expected the women to return to prewar duties and roles. 
</p>
<p>Although the study of sport and gender encompasses a broad set of topics, the work 
of most scholars in the field falls into two branches: (1) sport as a means for constructing 
masculinity and femininity and (2) discrimination against and limited opportunities for 
women. These subfields tend to echo differences among the major branches of feminism, 
radical feminism and liberal feminism (Messner &amp; Sabo, 1990, p. 4). This chapter con-
siders the contributions, strengths, and weaknesses of these two approaches. I first ex-
plore the ways participants use sport to help define masculinity and femininity. Scholars 
interested in these issues look at how sport employs and supports a damaging form of 
aggressive, competitive masculinity, how lower-status men use sport to create new ways 
of being masculine, and how female athletes struggle with notions of femininity as they 
compete in a traditionally masculine world. The second branch examines women's access 
to sports, exploring the growth in women's opportunities to participate, the continued 
discrimination female athletes face, and legal challenges to sex-based exclusions. Fi-
nally, at the end of each section I assess the most prominent issues confronting research-
ers in each tradition. 
</p>
<p>2. MASCULINITY AND FEMININITY IN SPORT 
</p>
<p>Sport scholarship was, from its outset in the late 1950s until the early 1980s, focused on 
men (Messner &amp; Sabo, 1990, p. v). Even as researchers expanded sport scholarship to 
examine class and race (see Edwards, 1973 or Hoch, 1972), they largely ignored women. 
However, as the number of sportswomen increased, interest in a feminist scholarship of 
sport arose. In addition to empirical research on female athletes, feminist theorists also 
introduced new ways of understanding men, women, and gender in sport. 
</p>
<p>According to feminist scholars, sport is an arena in which men reproduce the domi-
nation over women that exists in other areas of society. Men construct sport so as to 
exclude women, suggesting that men enjoy essential physical superiority over women. By 
valuing sports in which size, strength, and speed are prized, men use the most extreme 
attributes of their sex to claim inherent biological superiority over women (Brown, 1986; 
Bryson, 1983; Theberge, 1986; Theberge &amp; Mineau, 1995). 
</p>
<p>In addition, men use sport to legitimate the segregation of men and women. The 
gendered division of space in sport&mdash;with men competing on the playing field and women 
allowed to cheer on the sidelines&mdash;resembles the gendered division of space in domestic 
and employment situations and in other spheres. In fact, the roles women play in other 
arenas limit their sport participation (Thomson, 1990). For example, Australian lawn 
bowling, a sport played by older men and women, provides an arena in which a woman's 
place as the second component of a heterosexual couple is highlighted. Playing their roles 
as wives, these women confirm their husbands' heterosexuality for viewers both on the 
field of play and on the sidelines. Further, they provide the domestic labor that frees their 
husbands to bowl; women, although competitive, can bowl only after other needs have 
been addressed (Boyle &amp; McKay, 1995). 
</p>
<p>Although American men have long voiced support for women's sport participation, 
national surveys suggest that they are less supportive when participation changes the 
balance of domestic roles and responsibilities, requiring men to share more household 
work (Richardson &amp; Hibbard, 1986). Women and men are separated into different sports. </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>and when in the same sports into different locker rooms and segregated competitions. 
Even in sports such as riflery or archery, in which physical differences between men and 
women have little or no impact, athletes are often separated by their sex. 
</p>
<p>2.1. Effects of Masculinity in Sport 
</p>
<p>Some scholars who study gender define masculinity as a set of characteristics and behav-
iors that define who men are and how they should act (Connell, 1990). These scholars 
note that many of these characteristics are chosen not to create definitions of masculinity 
for men, but to help men avoid activities sex-typed as feminine (Craib, 1987; Crosset, 
1990). Along with aggression, competitiveness, and a lack of visible emotion, a desire for 
and the power to obtain financial and occupational success are among the characteristics 
that combine to represent a desired and rewarded form of hegemonic masculinity for 
adult men. Although sport typically does not address financial and occupational behav-
iors and symbols, aggression, competitiveness, and impassivity are symbols of hegemonic 
masculinity that are highly prized in sport (Sabo &amp; Runfola 1980; Laitinen &amp; Tiihonen, 
1990). Male athletes and spectators alike use sport to access this type of hegemonic mas-
culinity. 
</p>
<p>Scholars viewing masculinity in this way suggest that masculinity, as practiced in 
sport, can be damaging to a wide variety of people. Most observers would expect that 
sport's brand of hegemonic masculinity can hurt both women and lower-status men, but 
fewer of those observers consider the ways sport masculinity can damage those who most 
successfully practice and internalize masculinity. Male athletes damage their own bodies, 
impair their relationships with others, and commit deviant acts in their pursuit of mascu-
linity. In addition, although it is possible that homosexual men, men of color, and lower-
class or -status men use sport to separate themselves from women, these men do not 
always have the same access to the characteristics, behaviors, and rewards of hegemonic 
masculinity. Men in these low-status situations may use sport to define an alternative 
form of masculinity or may shape their sports experiences to conform to their own defini-
tions of masculinity. Below, I review literature that claims that sporting masculinity harms 
all men; I then examine how lower-status men use sports to create alternative types of 
masculinity. 
</p>
<p>By rewarding size, strength, and speed and by requiring men and boys to prove their 
masculinity by denying pain and competing through injury, sport places masculinity 
squarely in the realm of the body (Whitson, 1990). Male athletes' bodies become "tools, 
weapons, and objects of the gaze" (Trujillo, 1995, p. 405). This unusual position for 
men&mdash;objects of the gaze&mdash;takes on further significance when we realize that most of the 
viewers doing the gazing are other men and that both the athletes and the gazers are 
participating in what they view as very masculine activities. Further, demonstrating mas-
culinity in sport requires athletes to use their bodies in a constant reification of status 
through victory. This cycle demands aggression of the participants&mdash;even the most suc-
cessful athletes are expected to defend their championships or take on new challengers. 
</p>
<p>Although accomplished male athletes may successfully defeat challengers to their 
status, they often experience serious injury; these injuries become symbols of masculinity 
as well. Sport requires violence to the athlete's own body and often toward other athletes, 
but rewards only the healthy, a kind of sporting survival of the fittest (McTear, 1994; 
Young, 1993). Even sports that do not require contact with other athletes, such as run-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>586 Mikaela J. Dufur 
</p>
<p>ning events, take a toll on athletes' bodies. Male teammates and coaches deride a reluc-
tance or inability to play though pain as a marker of weakness (Harvey, 1996). Unfortu-
nately, these injuries often persist after the athletic career has ended (Curry, 1993; Messner, 
1994; Young, 1993). 
</p>
<p>Violence and injury are not the only negative results of sport masculinity; adherence 
to the masculine ideal also damages relationships with others. Although many athletes 
describe close relationships with teammates, they do not characterize these relationships 
as intimate (Messner, 1994). Because masculinity, at least in part, is defined as that which 
is not feminine, male athletes' relationships with women can also be problematic. Men 
who play sports hold more traditional attitudes toward women than do nonathletes, re-
gardless of the type of sport the men play (Houseworth, Peplow, &amp; Thirer, 1989), and 
athletes from a variety of competitive levels describe a lack of intimacy with girlfriends 
and wives (Messner, 1994). Curry's (1991) study of locker room talk demonstrates that 
stories of sexual conquests, with women framed as sexual objects, are typical locker room 
discourse. Although this type of disregard for women is not limited to male athletes, the 
comparatively large number of athletes who are accused of sexual harassment and assault 
suggests that the hypermasculine ideals of sport encourage sexually aggressive behavior. 
The few studies available on this subject (e.g., Crossett, Benedict, &amp; MacDonald, 1995), 
however, are hampered by sample selection bias, poor response rates, and noncomparable 
populations and hence do not resolve this issue. Critics of these analyses (often coaches, 
athletic directors, or attorneys for the accused) claim that athletes are not, in fact, respon-
sible for a disproportionate number of sexual crimes, but that athletes' greater notoriety 
makes their crimes more public (Snyder, 1994). If it is true that male athletes commit a 
disproportionate number of deviant acts, this may be attributable to risk-taking norms 
common among male homosocial groups or to the need to impress those higher in the 
sport hierarchy (Snyder, 1994), but the small and nonrandom samples used to study this 
connection render any conclusions tenuous. 
</p>
<p>2.2. Ways of Creating Masculinity in Sport 
</p>
<p>Although the masculinity described in the previous section is widely embraced in sport, 
not all men construct masculinity in exactly the same way or have the same opportunities 
to enjoy high status. In proposing multiple ways of defining masculinity and femininity, 
Connell (1987) and others have suggested that men of color, lower-class or -status men, 
and gay men are excluded in many ways from practicing the dominant forms of mascu-
linity; the mechanisms by which these men might achieve high occupational status or 
acquire wealth are denied them. This exclusion exists in sport as well as in other social 
institutions, with the result that these men create alternative ways to gain access to the 
privilege and power associated with masculinity. 
</p>
<p>Although a large number of successful athletes in a few popular American sports&mdash; 
such as football, basketball, and baseball&mdash;are African-American, the vast majority of 
African-American athletes never reach the professional ranks where they might acquire 
the financial and occupational trappings of masculinity, and very few successful athletes 
in high-profile sports such as golf or tennis are from minority backgrounds (Leonard &amp; 
Reyman, 1988). Further, even the most successful professional African-American ath-
letes face discrimination when attempting to create sports careers after their playing days. 
Men of color, blocked from the occupational and economic mechanisms of masculinity. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Sport 587 
</p>
<p>have developed as a response "expressive and conspicuous styles of demeanor, speech, 
gesture, clothing, hairstyle, walk, stance, and handshake" that Richard Majors (1990, p. 
I l l ) has termed "cool pose." These athletes import cool poses into amateur and profes-
sional sport as touchdown dances, spiked footballs, and improvisational basketball (George, 
1992), allowing the athlete of color to "assert his visibility" (Majors, 1990, p. 111). Klein's 
(1995) excellent ethnography of Latin American baseball players demonstrates that these 
players, while exhibiting behavior typical of hypermasculine traditions, also display an 
alternative masculinity that includes physical affection among players and tender public 
affection for children. An intriguing idea, cool pose behaviors and the motivations be-
hind them remain understudied. 
</p>
<p>Since complex processes of socialization teach boys and men that homosexuality is a 
"negation of masculinity," (Connell, 1992, p. 736) gay athletes comprise another group 
who can find themselves blocked from symbols of hegemonic masculinity, although in 
this case the symbols are less likely to be occupational or financial. Male athletes use 
derogatory terms associated with homosexuality in attempts to label opponents&mdash;or team-
mates who do not meet the macho ideal&mdash;as less masculine and less powerful than them-
selves (Dundes &amp; Stein, 1985). As Klein's (1993) in-depth study of bodybuilding demon-
strates, the push to distance oneself from homosexuality is so powerful among the sport's 
practitioners that, although it is common for aspiring professional bodybuilders to act as 
prostitutes for gay men for supplementary income, these athletes cling to their perception 
of themselves as straight and claim that they exploit their clients. Gay male athletes may 
develop an "ironic sensibility" (Pronger, 1990, p. 144) that allows them to move through 
the homophobic world of masculine sport, working to blend in and appear heterosexual 
(Pronger, 1990, p. 148) while maintaining an understanding of their own sexualities. 
</p>
<p>More research is needed to address the ways age and class interact to affect men's 
perceptions of sport and masculinity. For example, boys are expected to play sports&mdash; 
indeed, sport is a crucial element in boys' peer- and status-systems (Messner, 1990; Thirer 
&amp; Wright, 1985)&mdash;but does the degree and type of sport participation change as boys 
become men or as men gain financial and occupational success? Do older, upper-class 
men use golf, yachting, and tennis as masculine symbols in the same ways Majors (1990) 
might argue that younger men of color might use football or basketball? Some scholars 
argue that spectatorship becomes the interface through which men access the symbols of 
sport masculinity (Nelson, 1994), especially if they are not (because of age or lack of 
ability) proficient athletes themselves. Such spectatorship becomes a masculine behavior 
in itself, where men identify with teams and players (Nelson, 1994), "bask in the re-
flected glory" of "their" team's success and identify with "their" player's manly acts, and 
use the language of sport to define their own masculinity even though they are not doing 
the masculine acts themselves (Wann &amp; Branscombe, 1990). If sport spectatorship is a 
way of creating masculinity for a large number of men and boys, a ritual of male culture, 
more research needs to be done to shed light on what sport spectatorship means to men and 
what their reactions are to the growing proportion of women who are sports spectators. 
</p>
<p>2.3. Creating and Defining Femininity in Sport 
</p>
<p>Since sport symbols are linked so intimately with masculinity, women's display of those 
symbols does not mesh well with the dominant femininity that defines women as physi-
cally attractive, petite, demure, weak, and supportive rather than aggressive. Scholars of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>588 Mikaela J. Dufur 
</p>
<p>sex role theory, such as Myers and Lips (1978) and Matteo (1988), seeking to explain 
how female athletes fit in a masculine structure such as sport, found that female athletes 
tend more toward androgyny than other women, especially when the athletes are in-
volved in traditionally masculine team sports such as basketball and volleyball. This 
approach, however, owes too much of its foundation to theories that limit gender to a few 
concrete categories, such as masculine, feminine, and androgynous. Further, the findings 
reflect only the attitudes and behaviors of samples of college students. Other scholars 
have conceptualized gender as a fluid continuum (Connell, 1987). Further, they have 
focused on the process of "doing gender" by creating and incorporating the behaviors and 
symbols associated with particular genders (West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987). This 
reconceptualization moves the study of female athletes away from sex role categories and 
toward a more nuanced understanding of the ways these athletes define and practice their 
own femininity. 
</p>
<p>Rather than creating an ironic awareness of themselves, as Pronger (1990) argues 
gay male athletes do, some female athletes counteract the mixed messages they receive 
about masculinity, femininity, and sport by engaging in impression management and 
marking themselves with obvious symbols of femininity. Such athletes become, accord-
ing to Felshin (1974), apologists who behave in especially feminine ways, both on and off 
the field, to assure onlookers&mdash;and themselves&mdash;of their status as women. For example, 
many of the growing number of female boxers in the United States wear pink trunks and 
trunks with skirts sewn on the back (Halbert, 1997), while some U.S. collegiate athletes 
wear jewelry, hair ribbons, and makeup during play (Blinde &amp; Taub, 1992). Interviews 
with both athletes and coaches suggest that coaches propagate this emphasis on hetero-
sexual standards of feminine beauty and encourage female athletes to "dress up," but 
avoid addressing the subject of sexuality with their athletes (Blinde &amp; Taub, 1992). Publicity 
campaigns associated with the inauguration of new professional women's basketball leagues 
in the United States demonstrate that this emphasis on feminine appearance persists. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps these strategies of "overfeminization" are a reaction to widespread assump-
tions that all female athletes are lesbians (Lenskyj, 1994). Cahn (1994) argues that such 
an image grows from the tension between athletic prowess and femininity. Certainly, 
many lesbians play sports, but, obviously, not all lesbians play sports and not all athletes 
are lesbians. Still, the negative image of the lesbian athlete persists; in the inaugural 
issue of Sports Illustrated''s spinoff magazine for women, WomenlSport, Olympic softball 
gold medalist Dot Richardson describes the dismay she initially felt when others assumed 
because of her sports participation that she was a lesbian, telling neighbors, "If you ever 
have a daughter, don't you ever let her compete in sports, because it's not worth it" 
(Richardson, 1997, p. 42). According to Blinde and Taub (1992), many female intercol-
legiate athletes internalize stereotypes concerning lesbians and athletes, leading to the 
kinds of "apologist" behaviors described previously. Such attitudes are damaging to both 
lesbian athletes, who are targeted as deviant, and to straight athletes, who find their 
athletic experiences affected by rumor and innuendo. 
</p>
<p>Since the form of femininity rewarding physically beauty, small bodies, and passiv-
ity that is so dominant in the United States, Canada, and many European countries does 
not mesh well with masculine sport stereotypes, it is not surprising that sports that some-
times highlight those feminine traits, such as figure skating and gymnastics, are ex-
tremely popular among both spectators and young athletes. Television ratings for both 
sports rival those of traditionally masculine sports such as football {Simmon's Market 
Research Bureau of Media and Markets, 1996). Rules for both of these sports differ for </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Sport 589 
</p>
<p>the sexes and emphasize different skills (Feder, 1995); for example, female gymnasts 
compete on different apparatuses than their male counterparts, and male gymnasts may 
not use music for their floor exercises. In addition, both sports require different uniforms 
for men and women; neither female gymnasts nor skaters may wear pants when compet-
ing. Unlike football or running, in which objective standards such as crossing a line or 
finishing before an opponent decide contests, judges determine the winners in both gym-
nastics and figure skating. Use of judges introduces the subjective component of the scor-
ing, and judges who are displeased with an athlete's choreography, costume, or music 
may lower that athlete's score. If a female gymnast or skater does not conform to the 
standards of dominant femininity, such as wearing sequined costumes or heavy makeup, 
the judges may give her low scores. 
</p>
<p>Gymnastics and figure skating are also sports that, because of the aerodynamics and 
the physics involved, reward petite, slender women (or, perhaps more accurately, girls; 
female Olympic and World Champions in these sports are very often in their teens, while 
their male counterparts are almost always in their mid-20s). The popularity of these sports 
reflects the popularity of a particular feminine body type that is prized in the United 
States and many other parts of the world. As women strive to acquire this body type, a 
type incompatible with most women's normal maturation, the focus of women's sport 
often becomes shaping a feminine body, where fitness equals heterosexual attractiveness 
(Duncan, 1994; Markula, 1995). Women in the United States, Germany, Finland, and 
Switzerland participate in recreational sport in numbers approaching those of men, but 
fewer women than men participate in sports that reward bulk, such as weightlifting. 
Women who participate tend to choose sports that shape traditionally feminine bodies 
and encourage weight loss, such as aerobic dance, ballet, and body sculpting (Firebaugh, 
1989; Gisler, 1995; Lamprecht &amp; Stamm, 1996; Marin, 1988). This emphasis on appear-
ance and the size requirements imposed by sports popular among women and girls may 
encourage eating disorders among young female athletes (Taub &amp; Blinde, 1992), although 
scholarly research into this question has so far been limited. Future research in this area 
should be especially concerned with the intersection of race and class with sports and 
body images; athletes in the sports that prize this especially "feminine" body type tend to 
be white and middle- to upper-class. Does this pattern indicate a tighter link between 
lookism and body image among middle- and upper-class girls? Certainly women and 
girls of color in team sports wear feminizing accessories such as hair decorations, jew-
elry, and makeup. Is their exclusion from sports emphasizing feminine body types merely 
an artifact of the relative class positions of most women of color and the relative expense 
of such sports? Do girls of color who participate in these sports experience the same body 
image issues their white counterparts face, and would such patterns increase among girls 
of color if they entered these sports in large numbers? 
</p>
<p>To summarize this section, the branch of sports studies that examines the ways mas-
culinity and femininity are played out in sport addresses the fluidity of gender and gender 
symbolism, extends understandings of the processes involved in creating masculinity and 
femininity, and increases knowledge about athletes who do not meet traditional norms. It 
is less proficient, however, in testing theory. The best examples of work in this tradition, 
such as Klein's studies of bodybuilders (1993) and Latin American baseball players (1995), 
Connell's interviews with gay surfers and ironmen (1990), and Curry's examination of 
locker room talk (1993) directly address this issue by outlining new theories of gender 
creation and relations and then providing detailed and nuanced data to support their 
theories. </p>

</p>
<p>In addition, although there is substantial discussion of how the norms of masculinity 
and femininity affect male and female athletes, there is little insight into how those norms 
are generated. Are they imported into sport from other institutions, making sport a mir-
ror of broader society? Or is sport a masculine archetype, creating symbols of a 
hypermasculinity that go beyond the norms found in other institutions? Finally, the ways 
women use sport to define their own gender must be further studied. If some female 
athletes are apologists (Felshin, 1974) who soften their athleticism by conspicuous use 
feminine symbols such as makeup and jewelry, what are we to make of women who do not 
use these symbols? This branch of sports studies can illuminate the border between soci-
etal expectations of gender norms and individual internalization and use of those norms 
if more and better data are tied to innovative ideas. 
</p>
<p>3. OPPORTUNITIES, BENEFITS, AND COSTS 
FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SPORT 
</p>
<p>Women have been involved in physical activity throughout history, even in the face of 
restricted opportunities and constricting notions of femininity; in the past 50 years, how-
ever, sport participation by women and girls has increased sharply. More women than 
ever before are playing sports in Western European countries (Guttman, 1991; Gratton &amp; 
Tice, 1994), current and former Communist countries (notably Cuba; see Bunck, 1990; 
Riordan, 1991), Japan (Kanezaki, 1991), and Nigeria (Anyanwu, 1980). 
</p>
<p>Participation in the United States has increased as well, as Table 26-1 demonstrates. 
The passage of Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amendment, legislation designed to 
ensure equal access to education-related resources and opportunities, spurred many of the 
new opportunities in the United States. Since the passage of Title IX, the number of 
women playing intercollegiate sports has increased fourfold (Staurowsky, 1996), and the 
average number of women's sports offered by U.S. colleges increased by 6% between 
1992 and 1996 alone (Haworth, 1997). I provide a more extensive discussion of the im-
pact of and challenges to Title IX later. 
</p>
<p>The growth in women's sport participation does not stem solely from greater female 
participation in traditionally female sports; instead, women are entering, in increasing

revenue" sports came in the early 1980s, when Title IX enforcement was a low priority for schools.

<p>numbers and with increasing publicity, sports that men dominated previously, such as 
sailing and surfing (Wenner, 1995), boxing (Halbert, 1997), and bodybuilding (Klein, 
1993). The marathon, which the Olympic Competition Committee long considered too 
grueling for female athletes, became a medal sport for women at the 1984 Summer Olym-
pics (Guttman, 1991). Few studies, however, examine the processes by which women 
enter these sports. Women also enjoy increasing opportunities to make careers as profes-
sional athletes; although women have played professional basketball in Europe and Asia 
for several years, two highly publicized leagues began play in the United States in 1996. 
In addition, prize moneys for women in some major tennis tournaments are now equal to 
the men's prizes (Kahn, 1991), and professional tours and competitions are growing 
rapidly in figure skating and gymnastics, providing career opportunities in sports in which 
female athletes are very visible and popular. 
</p>
<p>Numerous studies have documented significant benefits to female participation in 
sport. In sharp contrast to nineteenth-century beliefs that strenuous exercise would dam-
age a woman's reproductive capacity (Cahn, 1995; Guttman, 1991), modern studies show 
that heightened physical activity among women leads to greater fitness and health. Ac-
cording to studies medical researchers and physical educators have conducted on large 
and diverse samples, women who engage in physical activities have higher self-esteem 
and less depression and anxiety (Hall, Durborow &amp; Progen, 1986; Nelson, 1994, p. 33), 
osteoporosis is less likely among older women who exercise regularly, and pregnant ath-
letes experience fewer complications than nonathletes (Feyder, 1989). Using nationally 
representative data, Sabo, Melnick, and Vanfossen (1993) demonstrate that girls who 
participate in high school sports in the United States have better grades in high school, 
participate in more extracurricular activities, believe they are more popular than their 
nonathletic peers, are more likely to go to college, and are less likely to use drugs or get 
pregnant than are girls who do not play sports. Although some scholars have expressed 
concern that there are also costs to increased female participation in sports structures 
administered by men (Grant, 1984; Nelson, 1994), little empirical work has addressed 
this question; an exploration of whether women suffer in current sports structures would 
require better data and more detailed studies. 
</p>
<p>3.1. Continued Sex Discrimination 
</p>
<p>Although it is true that female participation in sport is growing, sex discrimination in 
</p>
<p>sport continues. Women still make up fewer than half of all professional and interscho-
</p>
<p>lastic athletes, receive fewer rewards for their athletic successes, and find access to par-
</p>
<p>ticular kinds of sports participation, employment, and administrative positions blocked. 
</p>
<p>Table 26-2 outlines some of these outcomes. 
</p>
<p>Women comprise fewer than half of intercollegiate varsity athletes and receive less 
</p>
<p>than half of the scholarship money schools provide for athletes. The contrast becomes 
</p>
<p>even sharper when looking at particular kinds of expenditures; women receive just over a 
</p>
<p>quarter of recruiting dollars and fewer than one fifth of the dollars spent on personnel. 
</p>
<p>Only 2% of head coaches of men's teams are women, while 45% of head coaches of 
</p>
<p>women's teams are men. Women are similarly underrepresented among administrators, 
</p>
<p>even if we examine only administrators of women's programs. 
</p>
<p>Continued discrimination against women finds its roots in youth sport, where chil-
</p>
<p>dren are taught competitiveness and gendered behavior early. In her excellent study of </p>

</p>
<p>"Two percent of all intercollegiate athletes play co-ed sports. 
''Personnel expenditures for all women's sports amount to less than half of the personnel expenditures for football ($890,330). 
</p>
<p>children's gender socialization, Thome (1993, p. 44) described a distinct geography of 
gender involved in children's play: boys dominate large spaces used for sports such as 
baseball, football, soccer, and basketball, relegating girls to smaller spaces closer to the 
school building. In addition, children ask for gender-typed play equipment that corre-
sponds to these spatial divisions, and playground aides sometimes prevent children from 
playing in areas "inappropriate" for their gender. As Landers and Fine (1996) observed, 
coaches of co-ed kindergarten tee ball teams treat prospective female athletes differently 
from their male counterparts, judging the girls' performance more harshly and transmit-
ting the message that boys have more right to play. 
</p>
<p>The sexism found in youth sport affects female athletes after they enter their chosen 
fields of play as well. Female athletes at many events, including the Olympics, must 
undergo gender verification tests to prove that they are women (Feder, 1995). In the past, 
these verifications consisted of visual inspection of genitalia; today, women must provide 
tissue (usually cheek scrapings) for chromosomal testing (Daniels, 1992; Nelson, 1994). 
Women's athletic teams are often given belittling or demeaning names; more than 50% 
of 4-year colleges in the United States use sexist names for women's teams, such as 
adding "Lady" to the mascot name (e.g.. Lady Rams or Lady Gamecocks), adding an 
"ette" suffix to the mascot name (Yellow Jackettes or Thorobrettes), or using a diminutive 
version of the mascot for women's teams (Kittens or Belles). These naming techniques 
trivialize women's sport, but students, coaches, journalists, boosters, and a substantial 
number of faculty react angrily to any suggestion that less sexist mascot names be adopted 
(Eitzen &amp; Zinn, 1993). 
</p>
<p>3.2. Title IX 
</p>
<p>As described previously, Title IX has been influential in increasing the number of oppor-
</p>
<p>tunities for women and girls in interscholastic sports, but as few as 10% of schools are in </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Sport 593 
</p>
<p>full compliance (Naughton, 1997a, b; Sabo, 1997). The Department of Education's defi-
nition of and the Office of Civil Rights' clarification of the scope of the law instituted 
three measures of compliance: "Substantial proportionality," where the percentage of 
female athletes at a school is within five percentage points of the undergraduate popula-
tion; "effective accommodation," for schools that can show that they have polled female 
students on their interest in sport and are providing, enough opportunities to fully meet 
that interest, even if those opportunities fall short of proportionality; and a "history of 
expanding opportunities," for schools that have made efforts to expand women's oppor-
tunities and file plans showing how they intend to progress toward proportionality. The 
courts view meeting any one of the three prongs as compliance with the law, yet many 
schools remain out of compliance, resulting in a surge of lawsuits brought by female 
athletes (Heckman, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Although courts have tended to rule in favor of female athletes in cases brought 
against schools (see, e.g., Cohen v. Brown 1997, also known as "Cohen III"), the burden 
of demanding compliance falls on athletes and coaches to initiate lawsuits. Representa-
tives of men's sports associations, such as the College Football Association and the Ameri-
can Football Coaches Association, have testified at Congressional oversight hearings on 
the Office of Civil Rights' enforcement of Title IX, alleging that male collegiate athletes 
are being victimized by aggressive female athletes and lawyers (Staurowsky, 1996). The 
result is that some members of Congress are discouraging federal oversight of Title IX 
compliance by proposing legislation that no money designated for the Office of Civil 
Rights be used to investigate athletic cases (Blum, 1995; Haworth, 1996). While lawmak-
ers debate this particular law, and interested parties debate the intent and interpretation 
of Title IX, scholarly examination of Title IX and its influence in encouraging female 
athleticism has gone largely ignored. 
</p>
<p>3.3. Women in Coaching and Administrative Positions 
</p>
<p>Women have even more difficulty finding sports opportunities off the field. Abbott and 
Smith's (1984) study of vacancy chains within the coaching labor market suggests that 
women have acquired many of the new jobs coaching women, despite the fact that their 
data predate the more vigorous enforcement of Title IX. Nonetheless, a 25-year study of 
the coaching labor market shows that women now fill only half of all positions available 
coaching women and only rarely coach men (Acosta &amp; Carpenter, 1996). In addition, 
female coaches have lower status, lower salaries, fewer promotion opportunities, and 
higher exit rates than do their male counterparts (Knoppers, Meyer, Ewing, &amp; Forrest, 
1989,1991). Female coaches' lower pay&mdash;coaches of women's U.S. collegiate teams make 
an average salary that is 44% lower than head coaches of men's teams&mdash;results in part 
from their exclusion from men's sports (Naughton, 1997b; Sabo, 1997). Female coaches 
in youth leagues more often fill administrative roles, such as record-keeping and trans-
portation, while male coaches more often perform on-field duties (Landers &amp; Fine, 1996), 
echoing the gendered space and role considerations Thome (1993) found among children 
and that occupational scholars have repeatedly demonstrated in the work sphere (Reskin 
&amp; Padavic, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Female coaches in the Unietd States, Britain, and Canada also have few opportuni-
ties to move into high-level sports administration. Men, who make up the vast majority of 
athletic directors and organization officials, tend to hire coaches and other staff members </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>594 Mikaela J. Dufur 
</p>
<p>who are most like themselves; they also claim that women's family responsibilities dampen 
female coaches' ambition (Knoppers, 1988; Stangl &amp; Kane, 1991; White &amp; Brackenridge, 
1985; Whitson &amp; Mcintosh, 1989). Although scholars who examine the trends in coach-
ing opportunities for women have begun to discuss the possible interrelations of human 
capital factors, structural constraints, and matching processes (Knoppers, 1992), no analysis 
has yet incorporated all three of these perspectives. 
</p>
<p>Finally, an interesting opportunity to study women's entrance into another kind of 
sports authority structure comes as the number of female referees, umpires, judges, and 
officials grows. The National Basketball Association's October 1997 announcement that 
two women will be among the referees who officiate men's professional games raises 
questions about how players, coaches, fans, and sports organizations will respond to women 
having direct control over the outcomes of both men's and women's events. These ques-
tions could also be addressed by examining gymnastics, tennis, and especially figure 
skating (in which female judges rate men, women, and pairs). 
</p>
<p>3.4. Female Athletes in the Media 
</p>
<p>Female athletes also experience discrimination in the sport media. In the United States, 
Canadian, West German, and Norwegian print media, female athletes are most notable 
for their invisibility; these women appear in fewer and shorter written articles, fewer 
photographs, and are described in stereotypically feminine ways (Alexander, 1994; 
Grossman, Hyslop, &amp; Guthrie, 1994; Fasting &amp; Tangen, 1983; Klein, 1988; Lumpkin &amp; 
Williams, 1991). In addition, the portrayals of women that appear on television are pre-
sented in a highly sex-typed manner. Content analyses demonstrate that television com-
mentators devalue female athletes; commentators more often refer to female than male 
athletes by their first names, minimize women's accomplishments, discuss female ath-
letes' looks, and describe character flaws that follow gender stereotypes. For example, 
commentators (who are, for the most part, male) distinguish between basketball and 
women's basketball, constructing the women's sport as marginal to the men's (Blinde, 
Greendorfer, &amp; Shanker, 1991); announcers working the Martina Navratilova-Jimmy 
Connors tennis match referred to Navratilova by her first name but to Connors by his last 
and praised Connors more frequently (Halbert &amp; Latimer, 1994; see also Messner, Duncan, 
&amp; Jensen, 1993). 
</p>
<p>One of the factors driving the gendered representation of women athletes in the 
media may be the difficulties facing female sportswriters and commentators. Women, 
while making some gains, still make up a very small proportion of the reporters covering 
sports. Although the number of female members of the media covering women's events is 
growing, the majority of these assignments still go to men. Continued growth in the 
number of female commentators may decrease the sexist coverage of events described 
previously. Very few women, however, cover men's events. In addition, it is difficult for 
the female sportswriters who do cover men's sports to gain access to their workplace, 
possibly because their entrance is seen as an intrusion on the imposed separation between 
men and women or because "nice" women are expected to avoid masculine bodies and 
territories. Female reporters continue to be removed from locker rooms and fields while 
trying to conduct interviews, and most report that they have been the target of sexist 
gestures and remarks from male athletes (Disch &amp; Kane, 1996; Nelson, 1994) 
</p>
<p>The strength of arguments concerning discrimination against female athletes&mdash;and 
the perception of sports studies other scholars hold&mdash;could be improved by a greater </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Sport 595 
</p>
<p>attention to tying findings about sport to broader social trends and theories. The branch 
of sports studies that looks at discrimination and opportunities would be strengthened by 
advancing theory or by framing empirical findings in an ongoing theoretical discussion. 
For example, although there are many descriptions of the kinds of sports into which 
women athletes and coaches are channeled, scholars have rarely used sex stratification 
theory, queuing theory, the interactions among political, legal, and economic structures, 
or weak- and strong-tie social networks to inform the research. Similarly, studies that 
describe the growth of female participation would benefit from drawing comparisons to 
the social movements literature. 
</p>
<p>4. INTERSECTIONS OF RACE, CLASS, GENDER, AND SPORT 
</p>
<p>Several scholars have called for more critical analyses of sport that consider how race and 
class work differently among male and female athletes (see, e.g., Birrell, 1989; Wenner, 
1994), but few studies have taken this step. Most work that examines both gender and 
race, while insightful, has focused on whether forms of racism that exist in men's sports 
are present in women's sports (e.g., Eitzen &amp; Furst, 1989). Scholars who study how men 
of color create alternative masculinities more fully approach the task of incorporating 
race and class into their analyses (Majors, 1990; Messner, 1994). Little work has been 
done on how female athletes of color interpret their sport identities or experiences. Simi-
larly, although there is ample evidence that women of color experience discrimination in 
the workplace based on both their race and their gender, little research has assessed 
similar issues among female athletes, coaches, or administrators. 
</p>
<p>5. CONCLUSION 
</p>
<p>Sport is an exciting field in which to study gender. Sport as an institution provides an 
arena in which to examine the dynamics of gender and gender relations, which are high-
lighted as the sport institution changes. However, the study of sport and gender cannot 
fulfill its promise until sports scholars address theoretical and methodological shortcom-
ings. One body of scholarship asserts that sport encourages and uses an aggressive, com-
petitive masculinity that damages both the men who practice it and others who consume 
it as spectators. The dominant form of masculinity has a negative effect on athletes' 
health and personal relationships and may encourage deviant behavior. In addition, this 
perspective examines the ways lower-status men, who may have their access to the re-
wards of hegemonic masculinity blocked, use sport to create alternative types of mascu-
linity, such as incorporating "cool pose" behaviors into sport through celebration dances 
and improvisational basketball. Finally, this perspective examines the ways female ath-
letes create and internalize ideals of femininity as they compete in a traditionally mascu-
line world, finding that many women use distinct outward symbols of femininity or seek 
arenas in which they may construct a new definition of sport. 
</p>
<p>The other body of scholarship, which examines the growth of women's opportuni-
ties in sport and continued discrimination toward women, is useful in describing trends, 
such as the growth of women's participation in sports, the continued exclusion of women 
from coaching and administrative positions, and the effects of legal strategies such as 
Title IX on women's access to athletics. Studies drawing on these ideas show that female 
athletes have made substantial progress in their rates of participation and that these ath-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>596 Mikaela J. Dufur 
</p>
<p>letes are competing in more sports than ever before. These studies also demonstrate, 
however, that women and girls still make up fewer than half of all interscholastic and 
intercollegiate athletes and that the athletes who play at these levels have access to fewer 
resources than their male counterparts. 
</p>
<p>The first perspective, while theoretically sophisticated, suffers from a lack of con-
nections between reliable data and analysis and impressive theoretical underpinnings; 
work in the second tradition more often uses nationally representative and generalizable 
data, but neglects to place findings into theoretical context. Much work is still to be done 
in both perspectives. For example, just as scholars have examined how lower-status men 
create alternative forms of masculinity in sport, it would be fruitful to explore how female 
athletes create alternative forms of femininity through sport participation. Scholars studying 
the participation of and opportunities for women in sport might frame the growth in 
participation rates as a social movement or might integrate human capital, structural, 
and matching perspectives to examine the relative dearth of female athletes, coaches, and 
administrators. Integrating the two perspectives' strengths will improve the field's work, 
and the perception of that work, as scholars generate new studies examining old ques-
tions and new ideas about the ways race and class affect gender within sport.

<p>Gender and Religion 
</p>
<p>ADAIR T. LUMMIS 
</p>
<p>1. OVERVIEW 
</p>
<p>The saga of gender and religion, as told in one faith tradition after another, traces a theme 
of founders' original texts placing equal value on women and men, texts that were later 
used selectively by male religious leaders to legitimate patriarchy (Holm, 1994). This is 
not the end of the story, however. External social forces and situational exigencies im-
pinge on any faith community and its members, leading them to change gendered roles 
temporarily or more permanently (Lindley, 1996; Wessinger, 1996). For such reasons, 
faith communities across religions, and within one religion in varying regions and times, 
are likely to exhibit differences in the degree to which women are perceived and treated 
as the spiritual and mental equals of men. For many decades women's participation in the 
leadership and development of religions was nearly invisible (Wallace, 1997). However, 
during the present decade, women and religion has become a major research focus, with 
many new books and articles in this area appearing annually. Recent publications make it 
possible to begin answering the question: Under what conditions and circumstances will 
women gain and retain parity with men in world religions? This chapter summarizes 
recent answers to this question, based primarily but not exclusively on research focusing 
on women in twentieth century American religion. 
</p>
<p>2. RELIGIOUS VALUES AND GENDER PARITY 
</p>
<p>IN RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP 
</p>
<p>Scholars generally concur that religious tenets are not the cause of women's lesser stand-
</p>
<p>ing in the liturgy and leadership of religious or secular communities and institutions.

</p>
<p>Rather, religious values are used to justify and "explain" practices arising from more 
worldly sources for curtailing the leadership role of women (Chafetz, 1989; Holm, 1994; 
Nason-Clark, 1987; Wessinger, 1996). Although the founders of major faiths may not 
have gone as far as championing complete parity in men's and women's potential for 
spiritual growth and fitness for religious leadership, they were unusual for their times in 
being advocates of greatly increasing the rights of women in society and in their faith 
communities. For example, Jesus, Muhammad, and Buddha are described in core reli-
gious texts as supporting women's assumption of active roles in the new faith communi-
ties, and they are cited for promoting more humane treatment of women than existed in 
their societies during their lifetimes (Holm, 1994). Original texts of major religions con-
tain passages that can be used to support equality between the genders in most, if not all 
life arenas, passages that were selectively ignored by later religious patriarchs in favor of 
passages justifying women's appropriate position in faith and family as clearly under 
male jurisdiction (Holm, 1994; Wessinger, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Confluence of emphasis on divine patriarchy and of men's domination of religious 
and secular leadership has long undergirded women's subordination and limitations in 
many faith traditions. However, in eras of rapid social change, myths are modified to fit 
the altered situations into which women and men are thrust. New situations that cause 
people from different traditions to live and work with one another can disrupt this patri-
archal peace. Advocates of new paradigms emphasizing women's divinely sanctioned 
leadership role in the formation and maintenance of a particular faith are able to gain 
more legitimacy and acceptance. For a contemporary illustration, women scholars and 
spiritual feminists of both genders are emphasizing the importance of women in the for-
mation and development of Judaism and Christianity, through retranslations of original 
texts and new exegesis, and through more thorough examination of women's actual roles 
in the history of these religions. 
</p>
<p>Religious and other cultural movements, abetted by industrialization, have brought 
women together outside their families and communities of faith. Women who gather 
away from the direct supervision of men, both now and earlier may, through sharing 
experiences and ideas, begin to question some of the religiously based notions about 
women's place with which they grew up. Beginning in the latter part of the eighteenth 
and continuing into the nineteenth centuries, the Second Great Awakening in the United 
States brought women together in mission activities, inspiring many to take, or attempt to 
take unprecedentedly active roles in their congregations as well (Lindley, 1996). The 
industrial and postindustrial revolutions increasingly created jobs for women, and the 
women's movement led to far greater acceptance of women's salaried employment, even 
in traditionally male-dominated occupations such as the clergy. These factors not only 
brought women together outside their religious and family groups, but also increased 
their motivation for acquiring access to higher education. In turn, increasing education 
expedited women's refusal to accept the idea that they are not as capable as men of serv-
ing as leaders in congregations and in regional and national organizations (Wessinger, 
1996). 
</p>
<p>Immigration or social mobility can also bring women into contact with others who 
may share some but seldom all of their values. Immigrants with traditional religious 
faiths who come to the United States may encounter a different set of social values and 
expectations than those in their country of origin. Younger immigrants, and especially 
their children, often depart from their familial religious beliefs and modes of gendered 
participation in worship settings and private life (Lindley, 1996). At least partly as a </p>
<p/>

<p>Gender and Religion 603 
</p>
<p>result of the "export" of American cultural values concerning gender, liberalization of 
social and religious attitudes pertaining to gender roles among members of traditional 
religions has also been occurring in other countries. This has resulted from the influence 
of Americans working abroad as missionaries, business entrepreneurs, and medical per-
sonnel; from visiting relatives or touring; and through the export of mass media and 
translations of English language films and books into the language of the native country 
( Young, 1994). Such comingling of people who share religious identities but not other 
social location characteristics ( or vice versa) can raise questions about why one's reli-
gious leaders, in comparison to those of others one meets, are interpreting texts in a 
particular way or are less eager to include women in religious organizations (Holm, 1994; 
Lindley, 1996; Reuther, 1994; Wessinger, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Migration, imperialism, international travel and communication, and ensuing mod-
ernization can contribute to valuing pluralism on a collective level. This pluralism can 
occasion dissonance for individuals between their core beliefs, changing perceptions of 
the world around them, and divergent values of others. Some find that such dissonances 
can be resolved fairly smoothly by altering slightly how they interpret or apply basic 
beliefs to their new situations; some find it easier to shut out incompatible views by 
denigrating and avoiding those who express them. However, the more persons interact 
with those of other faiths and practices, the greater their opportunity to adopt different 
outlooks. 
</p>
<p>Congregations, faith communities, denominations, or other divisions within reli-
gious traditions that have come to value being seen as "modern" are likely to voice com-
mitment to gender equity in religious participation and leadership (Chaves, 1997; Young, 
1994). Changes toward gender equity include: small increments in the number of women 
in some liturgical roles or supervisory positions; long-term "temporary" measures in which 
women fill interim positions without doctrinal change or promise of continuation; and 
more sweeping changes, such as ordaining women to full clergy status. Some apparent 
changes religious authorities make to better incorporate women are so minor or tentative 
that they can easily be reversed to the status quo ante, and may well be with a switch in 
top leadership of the religious body. Some of the changes will be seen as a good by sub-
stantial numbers of congregants, legitimated by canon and constitution, and become the 
new institutional paradigm. Other changes will be accepted by one division or faith com-
munity and rejected by others, causing schism and possibly resulting in the formation of 
new faith communities or larger divisions within the religious body. 
</p>
<p>The foregoing factors are not unique to any one major religion, but each religion 
exhibits a different pattern of change toward greater gender equality in religious values 
and leadership. This is illustrated in the following overview of how these factors combine 
and interact to affect the inclusion of women in religious leadership in four historic faiths. 
</p>
<p>3. GENDERED FAITH AND FUNCTION 
IN FOUR WORLD RELIGIONS 
</p>
<p>3.1. Judaism 
</p>
<p>Women heroines, teachers, and prophets appear in the Old Testament but more sparsely 
than recent scholarship indicates was their influence in biblical times (Elwell, 1996). 
Jewish law traditionally governed almost all aspects of daily living. The law was consid-</p>

</p>
<p>ered divinely inspired by most Jews until the nineteenth century and is still by many 
contemporary Orthodox Jews. Jewish law was the scaffolding of a "separate but equal" 
theory of gendered authority, in which men were to be the leaders in the external world of 
synagogue and society, and women were expected to be primarily responsible for seeing 
that the laws were followed faithfully within their households. In practice, women were 
clearly subordinate to the men in their homes. In the synagogues, women were expected 
to sit demurely apart from the men and never lead prayers for a mixed-sex group. Women 
were revered in the home only (Elwell, 1996; Wright, 1994). 
</p>
<p>In small, stable communities of preindustrial Europe, women had little choice but 
to accept their place if they wished to remain Jews. However, during the nineteenth cen-
tury, in response to the expanding opportunities for Jews to work and socialize with other 
Europeans in mixed religious and ethnic enclaves, a group of educated younger Jews 
developed a looser interpretation of Judaic law, more in keeping with the practices of 
non-Jews near whom they lived and worked. Women in wealthier Jewish families began 
to obtain education equal or superior to that of most Jewish men. These women and their 
families were among those who supported the development of Reform Judaism, which 
does not hold that the law was divinely dictated. Rather, the law could and should be 
adapted to bring the Jewish faith more in line with the modern world, particularly in 
equalizing the status of women to that of men in the family and in worship. Women in 
Reform Judaism were included with men both in prayers and synagogue seating arrange-
ments, but they were still unlikely to hold organizational positions within the synagogue. 
In keeping with middle-class German and American family life of the nineteenth century, 
the women's place remained the home and men's the rest of the world. Still, the fact that 
change was permissible and even desirable in applying religious laws to daily life laid the 
groundwork for future changes (Davidman, 1991; Lindley, 1996; Umansky, 1985). 
</p>
<p>Today in the United States, Reform Judaism is second in size to Conservative Juda-
ism. Conservative Judaism is a denomination that came into being in twentieth century 
America, combining elements of both Reform and Orthodox Judaism. Although it retains 
more strict adherence to dietary laws and religious observance set forth in Jewish law. 
Conservative Judaism resembles the Reform movement in its emphasis on the equitable 
treatment of women (Davidman, 1991). At the end of the twentieth century, women are 
still not allowed to be rabbis or lead prayer services within Orthodox synagogues in the 
United States. The Reform tradition, and the small but even more liberal Reconstructionist 
branch of Judaism, began ordaining women as rabbis in the early 1970s. Under pressure, 
the Conservative Jewish Seminary followed suit a decade later and in 1984 enrolled women 
in the program leading to ordination (Schulman, 1996; Umanksy, 1985). 
</p>
<p>Growing proportions of liberal synagogues not only have women as well as men 
leading prayers, but they are also using gender-inclusive language to refer to humans and 
to God in prayers (Elwell, 1996). Some feminist Jewish women want a great deal more 
change in the treatment of women theologically, including the use of a female image of 
God in rituals and reinterpreting the Torah to make it less patriarchal in language and 
application (Carmody, 1994). At the end of the twentieth century, non-Orthodox Jewish 
women have a far greater role in public worship and synagogue leadership than they did 
at the beginning of this century. Nonetheless, some Jewish faith communities (e.g., the 
Hasidim) are almost as restrictive of women's roles as was typical generations earlier 
(Davidman, 1991; Kaufman, 1991). </p>

<p>3.2. Islam 
</p>
<p>The Qu'ran is believed by Muslims the world over to be the last revelation of God given 
only to Muhammad. The Qu'ran was unique for its time in specifically delineating basic 
rights, as well as duties for women, and in stressing that women are the spiritual equals of 
men. In addition to the Qu'ran, further interpretation and guidance is given by the hadith, 
or sayings made by or about Muhammad and written down by his followers. The Qu'ran 
and hadith form the basis of Islamic law, guiding all aspects of life. Yet, no set of laws 
could fit all the changes that were occurring even in the time of Muhammad, not to 
mention subsequently. Muhammad himself changed practices he instituted but later found 
unworkable. 
</p>
<p>Muhammad may well have treated his wives and other women better than many 
other men of his time. However, toward the end of Muhammad's life, and especially after 
his death, women's freedom to participate in communal religious life was curtailed for 
"their protection" (Badawi, 1994; Smith, 1985). In past centuries as in the present, there 
have been differences among Muslim communities in the extent to which they believe 
Islamic law should be applied strictly or interpreted to meet the needs of Muslims in their 
particular social and cultural circumstances. Even "strictly interpreted" Islamic law is 
not unequivocal. Since the tenth century there have been four classical schools of law: 
HanbaU, Hanafi, Maliki, and Shafi'i. In Sunni Islam, to which 85% of the world's Mus-
lims belong, it is an accepted tenet that there will be some differences among schools in 
how to apply religious laws in particular situations (Badawi, 1994). This factor has al-
lowed, if not encouraged, Muslim communities in different areas and of diverse ethnic 
identities to develop their own variations in applying Islamic law. 
</p>
<p>Most of the increasing numbers of Muslims in the United States are immigrants or 
their descendants from Middle Eastern countries, although the number of "indigenous" 
or Black Muslims is also growing. Muslims of different national origins carried their 
varying interpretations of Islamic practices to the United States. Serial migration of ex-
tended families often resulted in enclaves of Muslims in large cities, each with its own 
mosque, religious practices, and set of expectations about how Muslim women were to 
dress and act in the home, in the mosque, and with non-Muslims (Haddad &amp; Lummis, 
1987). 
</p>
<p>Mosques became centers of religious and social life in America to a degree far greater 
than in their countries of origin. Although women seldom attend mosque prayers in Muslim 
countries, they are far more likely to do so in the United States, where Islam is not the 
predominant religion. Also unlike women in Muslim countries, Muslim women in America 
have taken a major role in developing educational programs for children and youth, and 
raising funds for missionary outreach in their mosques. One reason Muslim women in 
the United States are both more active in their mosques and more likely to have their 
husbands' approval for this involvement than would be true in Muslim countries is be-
cause mosques serve as centers of worship, education, and social activities that help fami-
lies teach their faith and keep their children in an otherwise non-Muslim environment 
(Haddad &amp; Lummis, 1987; Lindley, 1996) Modern American values that support women's 
religious and social involvement beyond their front doors also encourage Muslim women's 
greater involvement in their mosques. Muslim women can see Jewish and Christian women, 
other "people of the Book," expressing their faith through regular attendance at congre-</p>

<p>gational services and being active in its educational, social, and mission work. Are Mus-
lim women less religious? 
</p>
<p>Immigrant Muslims in America may have particular difficulty in remaining pious 
practitioners of Islamic laws if they do not have ongoing involvement with other Muslims 
in a mosque or Islamic community center. Muslim men and women immigrants who 
socialize with those of other faiths more readily adopt liberal attitudes toward women's 
role in the family, society, and religion than those who socialize little, if at all, with non-
Muslims. Also, gender egalitarian values in the surrounding culture are transmitted through 
the mass media and through non-Muslims with whom they work and go to school. The 
longer immigrant Muslim men and women live in America, the more apt they are to 
approve of women taking leadership positions in their mosques (Haddad &amp; Lummis, 
1987). Even in the most liberal mosques, however, women are still not allowed to be 
imams. 
</p>
<p>Women who wear "Islamic dress," or clothing that covers all parts of their bodies 
and veils that hide their hair, if not their faces as well, are most likely to be those who 
adhere to a traditional interpretation of women protected and directed by men. Funda-
mentalist movements in some countries have led to an insistence that, whatever their own 
inclinations, women wear Islamic dress or be severely punished. There are also, however, 
well-educated Muslim women, fairly outspoken leaders in this country and in the Muslim 
world, who wear Islamic dress as a symbol of their commitment to the Islam. They be-
lieve that creating needed social reforms to benefit women and children will be easier if 
by their dress they exemplify dignity and their pride in being Muslim women (Haddad &amp; 
Lummis, 1987; Lindley, 1996; Smith, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Smith (1994) predicts that expanding educational and occupational opportunities 
for Muslim women in more traditional Muslim countries will likely lead to new interpre-
tations of women's appropriate role there as well as in America. However, given the 
Islamic focus on the family, these interpretations are unlikely to be those that would 
appeal to most liberal women of other faiths. Further, in the United States as in other 
countries, some mosques and Islamic movements have taken a conservative, if not reac-
tionary turn, attracting men particularly but also women who prefer traditionally gendered 
roles in mosque and family. The likelihood is that although the core of Islam will remain 
stabilized by the Qu'ran, cultural differences in interpretation of Islamic laws will con-
tinually maintain Muslim communities that are quite diverse in what they expect and 
permit women to do in mosque, family, and in the larger society. 
</p>
<p>3.3. Buddhism 
</p>
<p>Buddhist central tenets apply equally to women and men. Both genders are capable of 
and exhorted to attain spiritual enlightenment through disciplined growth in self-knowl-
edge, not through pleasing a Divine Father-Judge. By establishing an order of nuns as 
well as monks, Buddha demonstrated that he believed that women could rise as high as 
men in spiritual attainment. However, because Buddhism, like the other major world 
religions, arose in a patriarchal era, from the outset there was an accompanying cultural 
expectation that Buddhist women would defer to the authority of men in all settings. 
Buddha, too, conformed to temporal mores in his lifetime (about 560-480 B.C.) by mak-
ing the order of nuns subservient to monks, a situation that has not altered in over 2000 
years (Gross, 1994). </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Religion 607 
</p>
<p>In the following centuries Buddhism spread from India to other Eastern countries, 
especially those areas now part of China, Japan, Korea, and Malaysia, changing in vari-
ous aspects to fit particular local cultures. In medieval Japan, there were eight distinct 
Buddhist sects and there are even more in contemporary Japan (Martinez, 1994), with 
varying conceptions of women's spiritual state. Traditional Buddhist sects in Japan held 
women to be more polluted spiritually than men. Hence, women needed more restrictions 
placed on their involvement in Buddhist ceremonies, as well as close oversight by men in 
their families. In newer forms of Buddhism, such as the Reiyukai sect, women are more 
often seen as spiritual counselors and may come to be regarded as living Buddahs (Barnes, 
1994). Yet despite some differences among Buddhist sects, and the prominence of indi-
vidual women as teachers, counselors, and nuns. Buddhism has remained clearly male 
dominated in practice throughout the Eastern world (Barnes, 1994; Gross, 1994a). 
</p>
<p>Buddhist immigrants to America, primarily Asians, brought both their particular 
versions of this faith and its varying degrees of patriarchal cultural packaging. Although 
there are Buddhist temples in the United States, most of the worship activities are per-
formed in the home, as they are in other countries. It was not until about the middle of the 
twentieth century, when Zen Buddhism and other sects began to attract non-Asian Ameri-
cans, that Buddhism changed in practice. The non-Asian converts were leaders in urging 
that women's status be improved and that temples more closely resemble American con-
gregations in offering regular prayer services, education, and outreach and other pro-
grams. This led to the formation of a new sect, the Buddhist Churches of America, that 
retain Buddhist core beliefs but also incorporate Western ways of "congregating," even to 
the extent of allowing some women to lead prayers and a rare few to be ordained (Lindley, 
1996). Many traditional Buddhist sects continue to operate in America as they had in 
their countries of origin, often in cultural enclaves of immigrant and first-generation 
families residing near one another and maintaining the same gendered division of au-
thority as had their ancestors. 
</p>
<p>3.4. Christianity 
</p>
<p>Jesus is portrayed in the New Testament as including women among his friends, follow-
ers, and co-workers. Further, it was to women, not men, that Jesus first appeared after 
death as the resurrected Christ. However, in the ensuing five centuries, men shaped and 
focused Christian doctrine mainly around those biblical passages that relegated women 
to positions under men's authority (Drury, 1994; Torjesen, 1993). Change arose in women's 
perceived theological and actual church status, from colleague to subordinate, as Chris-
tianity moved from its radical beginnings to being a well-established religion, a pattern 
that would be repeated over and over in Christian congregations and sects during the next 
2000 years. 
</p>
<p>In the life cycle of the vast majority of Christian sects and denominations, women 
who had been spiritual authorities and congregational leaders on a par with men lost 
their influence and position to men as the congregations grew. However, this trend has 
not been linear. In some eras, regions, and denominations, women appear to have re-
gained a measure of religious authority, which sometimes they can nourish and expand 
throughout denominational echelons, and which sometimes they lose again to those who 
uphold the preeminence of male religious leadership (Barfoot &amp; Sheppard, 1980; Brubaker, 
1985; Carroll et al., 1983; Lindley, 1996; Wessinger, 1996). </p>

<p>3.4.1. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. Roman Catholicism has been the largest and most 
stably patriarchal Christian denomination since its inception. From the early history of 
this denomination, both its organizational leadership and spiritual life have been directed 
by men. Women in the New Testament, and later most women saints, were acknowledged 
for their gentle piety, caring, and support of men and children. Not all Catholic women 
accepted this interpretation of women's ideal role in the Christian family and congrega-
tion. However, women had no sustained support in their families or social circles to 
successfully challenge the male hierarchy to reconceptualize women as strong leaders in 
church, home, and country. One partial escape for such women was to join a convent. 
</p>
<p>Catholic women's orders of nuns provided opportunities to live independently and 
fairly comfortably in spiritual community with other women. Not only did Catholic 
religious orders typically provide some education for nuns, but becoming a nun secured 
for Catholic women an enhanced social status, if not standard of living, and offered op-
portunities to become leaders in their orders and other Catholic organizations. Although 
nuns may have enjoyed more autonomy than other Catholic women in Europe from the 
close oversight of men, they still deferred to the authority of male clergy in most areas. 
Nuns who followed Catholics immigrants to nineteenth century America were more suc-
cessful in gaining independence. They pressed their claim with Rome and their local 
bishops that for their orders to survive and flourish in America, there had to be an alter-
native to the European cloistered way of existence. They successfully sought the opportu-
nity to actively serve the educational and material needs of the faithful poor. New duties 
required new training. By the first decades of the twentieth century, American nuns were 
better educated than not only most other Catholic women, but also most women of other 
faiths (Drury, 1994; Lindley, 1996; Neal, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Vatican II in 1965 instigated many reforms, thereby shaking conceptions of an un-
changing church and heightening anticipation for further liberalizing changes. Vatican 
II reforms appealed to many in the American communities of well-educated nuns. They 
stretched further, educationally and occupationally, taking positions of authority in schools, 
hospitals, social service organizations, colleges, and universities. Some of these more 
modern religious communities supported nuns who pressed the Catholic hierarchy for 
more operational autonomy and permission to organize across orders to more effectively 
engage in social justice work. These requests met with resistance from a good number of 
Catholic bishops, especially those who already disapproved of nuns who now wore secu-
larized dress and were actively involved in community, political, and social justice causes. 
The bishops' resistance made these nuns more determined to fight for even more exten-
sive changes. They began lobbying the hierarchy to involve women far more in the liturgy 
and leadership of the Catholic Church (Ebaugh, 1993; Quinonez &amp; Turner, 1992, Weaver, 
1985). 
</p>
<p>The decrease in the number of priests in the United States provided the opportunity 
for highly educated nuns and other Catholic women, who had earned graduate degrees in 
Catholic institutions, to become, in effect, "pastors" of priestless parishes in the more 
liberal dioceses (Wallace, 1993) or to work in parish leadership teams with priests (Finn, 
1996). However, in recent years the Pope, who does not look favorably on this practice, 
has appointed bishops in dioceses across the United States who have terminated the ap-
pointment of many women who worked as pastors and pastoral associates in team minis-
try. The question remains, will the Church be able to continue this practice, given the 
continuing and worsening shortage of priests? </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Religion 609 
</p>
<p>Nuns are still among the most highly educated women in the United States, but their 
numbers are decreasing, especially in more socially concerned and actively involved or-
ders. In part, this may be attributable to the fact these orders give their nuns the choice of 
whether to live in a convent or to reside in the outside community alone, or with one or 
two others. Because the latter has become the most popular choice, the sharp reduction in 
the number of convents may be a factor in the diminishing ability of orders to recruit and 
retain nuns (Wittberg, 1994). However, a recent cross-national study indicates that social 
structural factors in industrialized countries, which are beyond the control of the Catholic 
Church, are likely of more importance. Specifically, women in industrialized nations 
have greater ease in acquiring higher education and gaining employment in managerial 
and professional occupations outside of the Catholic Church. In developing countries 
where social mobility for women is blocked, recruiting women to religious orders is still 
fairly easy (Ebaugh, Lorence, &amp; Chafetz, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Another possible contributory reason for the decline of nuns is that lay (nonvowed) 
women are beginning to more closely resemble nuns in taking major roles in the mission 
and ministry work of parishes and dioceses. Through organizations such as the Grail and 
the Catholic Worker's Movement in the first part of the twentieth century. Catholic lay 
women became actively involved in social justice causes (Lindley, 1996). In recent de-
cades, vowed and nonvowed women have joined national organizations (e.g., the Women's 
Ordination Conference) and local groups that work for a greater role for women in the 
religious leadership of the Catholic Church (Farrell, 1996; Winter et al., 1994). In the 
United States, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of Catholic laity, 
especially women, advocating not only that women be ordained in the Catholic Church, 
but also that laity have a say in making this decision (D'Antonio, Davidson, Hoge, &amp; 
Wallace, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Parishes in the United States and other countries do make some changes in response 
to parishioners' demands. A recent study found that continual migrations of Catholics 
from one country to another, with frequent returns to their birth country, actually created 
reciprocal parishioner- and priest- led changes in procedures and worship practices of 
parishes in both countries (Leavitt, 1997). The large size and international spread of the 
Catholic Church gives every reason to assume that continual change will occur, some of 
it possibly in terms of women's participation, but mostly opening opportunities for women 
to take leadership roles nationally and internationally. 
</p>
<p>3.4.2. PROTESTANT CHURCHES. Unlike the Catholic Church, which is one denomina-
tion, Protestantism is composed of diverse denominations, each of which may have as 
many internal divisions and variations as the Catholic Church. Some of these broad de-
nominational divisions were created within the last half of the twentieth century. Others 
are several centuries old in identity, basic liturgy, and polity, although these may have 
subdivided and made some changes in name, worship, and organizational styles. Some of 
the Protestant faith groups that were strong in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
did not survive into the twentieth century. In contrast, some currently growing sects and 
denominations have resulted from schisms and recombinations of groups of congrega-
tions and jurisdictions within the last two decades. 
</p>
<p>In nineteenth century America, the British Empire, and Europe, the degree to which 
individual Protestant denominations encouraged women's speaking in worship, leading 
prayers, or taking other active roles in congregational ministries varied widely. These </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>610 Adair T. Lummis 
</p>
<p>denominational divergences in acceptance of women in leadership roles continued and 
multiplied during the twentieth century. In changing social times, organized women's 
groups in denominations rose in influence, fell to the control of men, and sometimes 
recovered their autonomy. In several denominations, lay women who had led their na-
tional women's board to a position of prestige and influence through successful fund-
raising efforts saw these boards taken over by men and effectively dismantled (Zikmund, 
1993). Theology and church history accounts were variously used by denominations as a 
means of enhancing the growing chasms between those denominations that ordained 
women to some but not all positions, those that ordained women to every position open to 
men, and those that steadfastly refused to ordain women at all. With a few individual 
exceptions of famous women evangelists who also became organizational leaders of their 
denominations (such as Evangeline Cory Booth of the Salvation Army; Mary Baker Eddy 
of the Church of Christ, Scientist; and Aimee Semple McPherson of the Foursquare Gos-
pel Church), women who were allowed to preach, teach, and counsel when their small 
autonomous congregation or movement began found themselves replaced in these roles 
by men when the congregation or movement expanded in size, wealth, or joined with a 
larger congregation or became denominationally affiliated (Brubaker, 1985; Chaves, 1997; 
Lehman, 1987, 1993, 1994, 1997; Lindley, 1996; Nesbitt, 1995, 1997a, b; Poloma, 1989; 
Schneider &amp; Schneider, 1997; Zikmund, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Protestant denominations have waxed and waned in how equitably they incorporate 
women into congregational, judicatory, and national church leadership. However, certain 
denominations have more consistently followed a path toward gender equity then others. 
The denominations that have progressed steadily, with fewer backslides, are the histori-
cally liberal Protestant denominations: American Baptist, Episcopal, Disciples of Christ, 
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (merged denomination of the former Ameri-
can Lutheran Church and the Lutheran Church in America), Presbyterian, United Meth-
odist, United Church of Christ, and Unitarian. These are the denominations that ordain 
the greatest proportion of clergy women to full ministerial standing. It is tempting to 
attribute the ascendancy of these denominations in promoting women's inclusion in church 
leadership primarily to their more liberal theology. However, convincing historical analysis 
by Chaves (1997) shows that it is the extent to which denominations are eager to adapt to 
the modern world, rather than their theological stance, that is the most important predic-
tor of whether and the extent to which they ordain women. Denominations and sects that 
maintain an identity of standing firm against cultural winds tend to see women's ordina-
tion as symbolic of pressure to conform to the surrounding society. Refusing to ordain 
women is, therefore, an indicator of how strongly the denomination can be a bulwark of 
faith against worldly forces (Chaves, 1997). 
</p>
<p>At the same time, denominations that do not grant full ordination status to women 
but still wish to flourish in industrialized nations cannot completely ignore the strong 
secular norms for gender equality. It has not escaped the notice of several scholars that 
the renewed emphasis placed by conservative denominations on the "separate but equal" 
argument in maintaining distinct gender roles in congregational and family life is simply 
a way of rationalizing and legitimating their continuing patriarchal practices (Chaves, 
1997; Lindley, 1996; Wessinger, 1996). The culture of the congregation or denomination 
affects the extent to which its lay and clergy members will accept "separate but equal" 
arguments and theological justifications for male dominance in formal religious leader-
ship. Congregations most likely to endorse "separate but equal" arguments for preserving 
gendered spheres of congregational activity are those denominations with an "other </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gender and Religion 611 
</p>
<p>worldly" orientation to life. However, these may also be congregations which have press-
ing realities of life other than sexism with that their membership or immediate commu-
nity must deal, such as racism, poverty, crime, and substance abuse. 
</p>
<p>In the conservative Holiness and Spirit-centered denominations, women may be 
very active as ordained or lay leaders in their churches, but are far less likely to be em-
ployed full-time in church work compared to women in the liberal Protestant denomina-
tions (Zikmund, Lummis, &amp; Chang, 1998). Studies of evangelical clergy women in Pente-
costal and "Spirit-Centered" denominations (e.g.. Assemblies of God, Church of God, 
Nazarene, Free Methodists, and Wesleyans) indicate that in comparison to men, far fewer 
women are being ordained and even fewer are receiving full-time paid pastoral positions. 
Nonetheless, these "Spirited" clergywomen seemed curiously content with this inequi-
table situation ( Kwilecki, 1987; Poloma, 1989; Stanley, 1996; Zikmund et al., 1998). 
Researchers studying these groups arrived at similar explanations: these clergywomen 
are primarily focused on heaven, not earth, so earthly leadership is of less importance. 
Further, among earthly rewards, protecting the traditional nuclear family life is of higher 
priority than career success. For such reasons, these clergywomen tend to reject feminist 
values of gender equity in church, family, and occupations. 
</p>
<p>Women in predominantly African-American/Caribbean congregations (both free-
standing and denominationally affiliated) take active roles in the work, worship, and 
ministry of the churches, but men retain most of the formal leadership roles and "titles," 
such as chair of church board and pastor (Briggs, 1987; Gilkes, 1986; Lincoln &amp; Mamiya, 
1990; Lindley, 1996). For example, in some black Pentecostal churches women are called 
"teachers" when they preach, and only men hold the title "preacher" (Briggs, 1987). In 
rural black Baptist churches, women may preach at revival meetings held several times a 
year, but not on a regular basis as "pastors" of churches (Lincoln &amp; Mamiya, 1990). Like 
white clergywomen in the evangelical denominations described previously, black 
clergywomen may also value the nuclear family and heavenly rewards over career suc-
cess. In addition, black women are also exhorted to support the church leadership of 
black men who are denied leadership in white society. Not all black churches are equally 
discouraging of women taking formal leadership positions. In the historic black denomi-
nations, African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E), African Methodist Episcopal Zion (A.M.E. 
Zion), and the Christian Methodist Episcopal (C.M.E.), where there has been a long 
history of female ordination, there is also more verbal support for clergywomen as preachers 
and pastors than in the black Baptist churches (Lincoln &amp; Mamiya, 1990). Like 
clergywomen in the white evangelical churches, until 1970 A.M.E. clergywomen were 
either not hired at all or hired for the lowest paying, least pleasant church positions. 
However, since the mid-1980s, in response to clergy-women's challenge (and probably 
denominational interest in being seen as modern), A.M.E. clergywomen have been far 
more likely to serve as church pastors and fill denominational supervisory positions 
(Dodson, 1996). 
</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, the trends within Protestant denominations show a very uneven 
rate of growth in the opportunties for women to take leadership roles. Some denomina-
tions continue to refuse to ordain women. Athough from 1977 to 1994 the numbers of 
clergywomen have stayed about the same or declined in the conservative, evangelical 
"Spirit-Centered" denominations, in the more liberal Protestant denominations the num-
bers of ordained women have at least quadrupled during this time period. At the same 
time, clergywomen are stll being paid $5000 less on the average than clergymen with the 
same amount of church experience (Zikmund et al., 1998). </p>

<p>3.5. Education, Attitudes, and Orientations Affecting Women's Role 
</p>
<p>in Christian Churclies 
</p>
<p>Clergy and laity in most religions have attitudes and orientations that will impact how 
well they fit within the leadership expectations of their worship communities. Most of the 
research to date, however, has been conducted only within Christian or Jewish faith groups. 
The following discussion is therefore applicable mainly to Christians and Jews, but is 
likely also applicable to the experiences of women in other religions. 
</p>
<p>Religious feminists differ in what they see as the major causes of sexism and patriar-
chy, as well as what solutions they prefer for ending systemic gender discrimination. 
These solutions vary all the way from including women more equitably with men within 
the present structures to completely discarding these and rebuilding in a manner more 
inclusive and less hierarchal (Reuther, 1994; Riley, 1989; Russell, 1993; Schneiders, 
1991). There are denominational variations in what feminists stress (Briggs, 1987), al-
though the use of inclusive language, ordination of women, and female preachers and 
pastors are important to most feminists. Religious feminists have overwhelmingly come 
from the educated middle class, rather than the working class, and are predominantly 
Anglo. Women of color and ethnic minority women tend to feel that their major concerns 
are not heard by Anglo women. Anglo-feminism does not sufficiently take into account 
the demonics of racism and classism in the opinion of Asian-American women (Southard 
&amp; Brock, 1987), Latina women (Isasi-Diaz, 1993), and African-American women (Grant, 
1989; Williams, 1986). Similarly, women in the middle East and Asia reject much of 
Western women's individualistic feminism because it is disjunctive with their cultural 
values (Holm, 1994). 
</p>
<p>The higher their level of formal education, the more likely American Anglo women 
are to have a feminist perspective on leadership roles in religious organizations and using 
inclusive language in worship services, and this is especially true of Catholic women 
(Winter, Lummis, &amp; Stokes, 1994). One reason clergywomen in the "Spirit-centered" 
denominations and in the black Baptist and independent congregations do not appear 
"feminist" is that they have not had their expectations for equality with male clergy raised 
through seminary education (Wessinger, 1996). For example. Southern Baptist 
clergywomen, clergywomen in the predominantly white "Spirit-centered" denominations, 
and in predominantly black denominations who have M.Div. degrees are considerably 
more likely to protest inequitable treatment of women clergy in their denominations than 
their sister clergy who have not obtained an M.Div. degree from an accredited seminary 
(Ammerman, 1990; Blevins, 1996; Carpenter, 1986; Zikmund et al., 1998). 
</p>
<p>What if the women who are active leaders in denominations with more traditional 
notions of gendered authority acquire graduate seminary degrees and accompanying con-
victions that women can be capable clergy, but find their denominations resistant to chang-
ing their patriarchal ways? This is the situation with the increasing numbers of Catholic 
and Southern Baptist women who are earning graduate seminary degrees. Some of these 
angry Catholic and Southern Baptist women, like women alienated from their churches 
in other denominations, may join another denomination that they find more compatible, 
or drop out of Christian churches altogether. They may turn to religious movements such 
as Wicca or New Age/Neo-Pagan "Goddess groups" which offer them a spiritual antidote 
to the patriarchy they experienced in their former churches (Griffin, 1995; Neitz, 1991). 
</p>
<p>Some religions that include goddesses have been just as patriarchal as present de-
nominations with a mother-god (e.g.. Church of the Latter Day Saints) and female saints </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>(e.g., the Roman Catholic Church). Nevertheless, strong, wise, independent female im-
ages of the Divine are cited by feminist women as essential to their spiritual growth and 
an important corrective to an exclusively male or subservient female deity (Gross, 1994b; 
Schneiders, 1991), and a support for their engaging in social justice actions (Lummis &amp; 
Stokes, 1994). This last statement remains true for feminist women even if they do not 
envision God only in female forms (Block, 1997; Porterfield, 1987) and even if they 
remain in traditional churches (Lindley, 1996; Winter et al., 1994). 
</p>
<p>Sexual orientation is also likely to impact church involvement. Both Catholic and 
Protestant gay and lesbian persons are painfully aware of the disjunction between most of 
what their denomination teaches about sexuality and their own lifestyles. Christian gay 
men may hold either traditional views on women's church involvement, or more activist 
beliefs stressing gender equality in liturgy and church leadership. Christian lesbians are 
more likely than gay men to concur that women should have a role in church liturgy and 
leadership equal to or greater than that of men, and that liturgy should always incorporate 
female images of the Divine. Like heterosexual men and women disenchanted with orga-
nized religion, gays and lesbians may also drop out of church altogether. However, many 
stay if they can find ways to integrate their personal faith with those church doctrines and 
practices that reinforce their spirituality, while trying to ignore the hurtful aspects of their 
church's teachings about or treatment of homosexuals (Kirkman, 1996; Mahaffy, 1996; 
Yip, 1997; Zikmund et al., 1998). Some denominations are taking a lead in advertising at 
least certain of their congregations as "open and affirming" of the membership of gays 
and lesbian members and hiring "out" gays and lesbians as pastors (Wessinger, 1996). 
</p>
<p>4. ENHANCING WOMEN'S ROLE IN RELIGIONS: 
</p>
<p>OBSTACLES AND SUPPORTS 
</p>
<p>It has been long observed that women, not men, are the mainstay and most frequent 
attenders of services offered by communities of faith in almost all religious traditions, 
almost regardless of where they are located (D'Antonio et al., 1996; Hertel, 1995; Hoge 
&amp; Roozen, 1979). In Christian churches, moreover, having a female pastor is not a sig-
nificant predictor of whether the church will grow or decline in membership, or even 
whether more women will attend services (Lehman, 1985, 1987, 1994; Nesbitt, 1997a; 
Wallace, 1992, Zikmund et al., 1998.). Such facts do not change the minds of those who 
direfully predict that the rapidly approaching "feminization" of the ministry produced by 
an increase in the number of women clergy accompanied by some diminuition in the 
number of male clergy, will also result in an exodus of men from the pews. This numbers-
based fear of "feminization" is a major cause of "backlash" against women clergy in those 
denominations that ordain women and, in those denominations that do not, is another 
reason for never starting, when added to theological objections to women's ordination 
(Nesbitt, 1997a; Wallace, 1992). 
</p>
<p>"Feminization of ministry" fears are also based on the issue of whether women will 
"heretically" alter biblical texts, prayers, and reference to God to make them feminine or 
gender neutral, especially after the 1993 "Re-Imagining" conference in Minneapolis 
(Schneider &amp; Schneider, 1997; Wessinger, 1996). A recent cross-denominational study 
found that clergywomen in liberal Protestant denominations are somewhat more likely 
than clergymen to endorse "inclusive language" in church services, and are much more 
likely than men to want to use female imagery and names for God in worship. In liberal </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>614 Adair T. Lummis 
</p>
<p>Protestant denominations, it is also true that lay leaders of congregations pastored by 
women are more likely to endorse inclusive language in church services than lay leaders 
of congregations pastored by men. However, clergy women in the more evangelical "Spirit-
centered" denominations are as ambivalent or opposed to using gender-inclusive lan-
guage for humans or the Divine as clergymen in these conservative denominations, and 
their lay leaders are in accord with their clergy (Zikmund et al., 1998). 
</p>
<p>This suggests that women clergy are more likely than clergymen to be the "avant-
garde" in heralding further increases in the "feminization" of liturgy and theology only 
in those denominations which are open to modernization, to extend the argument of 
Chaves (1997). The very autonomy religious organizations enjoy from state control makes 
it unlikely that the feminization of clergy or theology will become normative throughout 
Christian congregations or those of other faiths in the United States. At the same time, 
industrialization, modernization, pluralism, and relative tolerance for diverse religious 
beliefs in the Western world have created the conditions under which even the most 
sacredly masculine organizational structures have been subtly feminized. These develop-
ments have greatly expanded the variability among faiths and worship centers in their 
conceptions of women's place in theology, liturgy, and leadership (Chafetz, 1989; Chaves, 
1997; Lindley, 1996; Wessinger, 1996) and have contributed to freedom of religious choice 
in industrialized democratic countries. In developing countries with autocratic regimes, a 
new government can curtail any such religious freedom within months, if not overnight 
(Young, 1994). 
</p>
<p>Western feminists strongly affirm freedom of religious choice. However, it is dis-
maying to those who have struggled to ensure gender equality in their faith communities 
that some young women appear uninterested in using inclusive worship language or tak-
ing leadership roles in congregations. Worse, they see some women of their faith among 
the younger generation remaining in or even joining congregations and sects in which 
liturgy and leadership are male imaged and controlled (Azria, 1996; Davidman, 1991; 
Kaufman, 1991; Lindley, 1996; Wessinger, 1996). Among these contemporary women 
"traditionalists," some may be rejecting gender equality because they want to be taken 
care of by a man, rather than having to agonize over making choices and taking respon-
sibility for their decisions (Azria, 1996; Davidman, 1991). Other women may value per-
sonal autonomy and gender equality in their work and social lives, but attend services in 
their congregations (churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples) primarily in order to 
be spiritually uplifted and experience a caring community. As long as they derive this 
comfort, they do not care who plans liturgies, mission, and ministry programs or who 
makes financial and personnel decisions (Ozorak, 1996). Some feminist laywomen, nuns, 
and ordained women leave their congregations and denominations for other faiths or 
even life completely divorced from organized religion (Carpenter, 1986; Ebaugh, 1993; 
Lummis, 1996; Schneider &amp; Schneider, 1997; Zikmund et al., 1998). Other women stub-
bornly stay in their congregation/denomination despite its patriarchy, and try to change it 
toward more gender inclusion in its liturgy and leadership (Winter et al., 1994). Choices 
women make in a free society will impact how much equity they and their daughters 
experience in their religious traditions and in their particular communities of faith. 
</p>
<p>In the United States during the last two centuries, women in Buddhist, Christian, 
Jewish, Muslim, and other faiths have moved "two steps forward and one step back," 
toward gender equity in theology and religious leadership, as Lindley (1996) concludes. 
The degree to which such change continues to march, however slowly, in a " forward" 
direction nationally and internationally will depend significantly on the degree to which </p>

</p>
<p>proponents can convince opponents that more gender equity is inevitable or will produce 
other outcomes valued by the proponents, such as the expansion of the particular religion 
(Sered, 1997). This overview of religion and gender indicates that women's full and 
equal participation in religion will continue to spiral upward, but just to the point where 
women achieve, not dominance over, but parity with men.

<p>Epilogue 
</p>
<p>JANET SALTZMAN CHAFETZ 
</p>
<p>It is impossible to write a genuine concluding chapter to a handbook comprising 27 
chapters that, collectively, examine nearly every social process, structure, and institution 
of interest to sociologists, through a feminist lens that focuses on the gendered nature of 
all aspects of social life. Instead, this brief epilogue constitutes my reflections about the 
state of gender sociology at century's end after 30 years of concentrated scholarship on 
the topic. 
</p>
<p>The 30-year-old history of vigorous feminist scholarship overlaps entirely the period 
of my postdoctoral professional life. I emerged from graduate school in 1968, as a spe-
cialist in sociological theory, social stratification, and political sociology, just as femi-
nism awoke from an almost 40-year slumber in the "doldrums" (Rupp &amp; Taylor, 1987 ). 
The Women's Movement immediately and permanently altered my career direction, even-
tually converting my attention specifically to gender theory, gender stratification, and the 
examination of women's sociopolitical movements. In this conversion process I was very 
typical of my cohort of female sociologists. Later cohorts could begin to focus on gender 
during their graduate (even undergraduate) education, but for those of us educated before 
the early 1970s, our first tasks were to remove our own androcentric blinders, to legiti-
mate this new sociological specialty to our still overwhelmingly male colleagues, and to 
try to develop new lenses through which to examine social life as a thoroughly gendered 
phenomenon. The chapter authors in this book represent both the "pioneer" cohort which 
came of professional age before, or just about the same time as, the flowering of second 
wave feminism, and younger cohorts who have entered gender sociology after it was 
established as a (quasi-) legitimate field of inquiry. Indeed, several of the chapters are 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>620 Epilogue 
</p>
<p>coauthored by members of different professional cohorts, and some authors are still graduate 
students, which augers well for the future of feminist scholarship in sociology. 
</p>
<p>During the last 30 years, sociology as a general discipline has changed remarkably 
in ways that have influenced and been influenced by feminist/gender sociology. Trained 
in the heyday of Parsonian hegemony, many of the pioneer cohort began from a sex roles 
perspective, albeit one revised in ideological flavor from an emphasis on the "functional 
utility"&mdash;even "necessity"&mdash;of existing gender arrangements, to a thorough critique of 
the system. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, radical sociology students (and some 
faculty) were resurrecting a Marxist analysis of capitalism, a development paralleled by 
the development of a Marxist-feminist perspective among some gender sociologists (as 
discussed in Chapter 1). The 1970s also witnessed a resurgence of interest in the broader 
sociological community, one paralleled by other branches of feminist scholarship, in sym-
bolic interactionism and ethnomethodology, and in the use of qualitative research meth-
ods. This, and related theoretical developments in the United States and Europe, devel-
oped into an increasing attack on "positivism" by many sociologists, an attack whose 
feminist variant is represented most clearly by standpoint epistemology (cf. Chapter 2). 
More recently still, general sociological interest in cultural studies and knowledge pro-
duction has increased, again paralleled by feminist versions (cf. Chapter 10 ). The past 
three decades have also witnessed the burgeoning of new substantive specialty areas, in 
many of which feminist sociologists have played crucial developmental roles (e.g., the 
Sociologies of Emotion and of Childhood, Gay and Lesbian Studies, and the Intersection 
of Race, Class, and Gender). Alongside of these changes, "traditional" theories, topics, 
and quantitative methodologies continued to flourish in our discipline and among yet 
other groups of feminist sociologists. It has been, and still is the case that "mainstream" 
(i.e., male) versions of these various theoretical, topical, and epistemological develop-
ments too often ignore their feminist variants (Alway, 1995; Seidman, 1994, p. 304; 
Stacey &amp; Thorne, 1985; Ward &amp; Grant, 1991), a reality that is beginning to change in 
recent years, however (Chafetz, 1997, pp. 98-99). 
</p>
<p>At century's end, with women constituting nearly half of all professional sociolo-
gists, and the Sex and Gender Section of the American Sociological Association consti-
tuting the single largest specialty section, one cannot understand the state of our disci-
pline without understanding gender sociology, just as one cannot understand the evolution 
of our specialty without understanding that of our discipline. The days when half of all 
humans&mdash;females&mdash;were all but invisible to most sociologists are now gone, but the re-
verberations of their inclusion are still being assimilated into the discipline's many and 
varied subspecialties and perspectives. Considerable numbers of feminist sociologists now 
specialize in virtually every subfield of sociology, challenging traditional theories, re-
search traditions, and interpretations as they create new ones. This handbook demon-
strates that fact with regard to a wide array of different topics, although no one volume, 
including this rather lengthy one, can include all of the myriad ways in which feminist 
scholarship has contributed to a more robust understanding of social life. Indeed, as I 
write this, I can easily think of several chapter topics that could (some may say should) 
have been included. Textbooks for a wide variety of different sociology courses are begin-
ning to reflect gender issues and feminist scholarship. However, they vary widely in the 
extent to which they do so and, with some exceptions (e.g., many texts in the area of the 
Sociology of the Family), most still have a long way to go in incorporating both gender as 
a fundamental component in their analyses (as opposed to the now frequent practice of 
adding sex as a "control variable") and specifically feminist approaches to understanding </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Epilogue 621 
</p>
<p>the processes, structures, and institutions on which they focus. In short, the ghettoization 
within sociology of feminist scholarship and the topic of gender is breaking down, but 
only slowly. Hopefully, this volume can serve to expedite that process. 
</p>
<p>I see this volume as a celebration of a third of a century of energetic, insightful, and 
outstanding scholarship by an ever-expanding community of sociologists who share a 
primary focus on gender and a commitment to feminist values. It is also a celebration of 
the healthy diversity of methodological, theoretical, and substantive differences among 
us that contribute to making our field an exciting intellectual enterprise. I have learned 
an enormous amount from reading these chapters as I edited them. Hopefully, other gen-
der scholars will also broaden their understanding, and their appreciation for the breadth 
of our field and for the myriad of different ways by which feminist sociologists contribute 
to our collective enterprise.
