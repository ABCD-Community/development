<p>Preface
</p>
<p>This book is based on junior and senior level undergraduate courses that I have
</p>
<p>given at both New York University and the University of Michigan. You might ask,
</p>
<p>in heavens name, why anyone would want to write yet another introductory text
</p>
<p>on quantum mechanics. And you would not be far off base with this assessment.
</p>
<p>There are many excellent introductory quantum mechanics texts. Moreover, with the
</p>
<p>material available on the internet, you can access almost any topic of your choosing.
</p>
<p>Therefore, I must agree that there are probably no compelling reasons to publish this
</p>
<p>text. I have undertaken this task mainly at the urging of my students, who felt that it
</p>
<p>would be helpful to students studying quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>For the most part, the approach taken is a traditional one. I have tried to
</p>
<p>emphasize the relationship of the quantum results with those of classical mechanics
</p>
<p>and classical electromagnetism. In this manner, I hope that students will be able
</p>
<p>to gain physical insight into the nature of the quantum results. For example, in the
</p>
<p>study of angular momentum, you will see that the absolute squares of the spherical
</p>
<p>harmonics can be given a relatively simple physical interpretation. Moreover, by
</p>
<p>using the effective potential in solving problems with spherical symmetry, I am
</p>
<p>able to provide a physical interpretation of the probability distributions associated
</p>
<p>with the eigenfunctions of such problems and to interpret the structures seen in
</p>
<p>scattering cross sections. I also try to stress the time-dependent aspects of problems
</p>
<p>in quantum mechanics, rather than focus simply on the calculation of eigenvalues
</p>
<p>and eigenfunctions.
</p>
<p>The book is intended to be used in a year-long introductory course. Chapters 1&ndash;
</p>
<p>13 or 1&ndash;14 can serve as the basis for a one-semester course. I do not introduce
</p>
<p>Dirac notation until Chap. 11. I do this so students can try to master the wave
</p>
<p>function approach and its implications before engaging in the more abstract
</p>
<p>Dirac formalism. Dirac notation is developed in the context of a more general
</p>
<p>approach in which different representations, such as the position and momentum
</p>
<p>representations, appear on an equal footing. Most topics are treated at a level
</p>
<p>appropriate to an undergraduate course. Some topics, however, such as the hyperfine
</p>
<p>interactions described in the appendix of Chap. 21, are at a more advanced level.
</p>
<p>These are included for reference purposes, since they are not typically included in
</p>
<p>vii</p>

<p>viii Preface
</p>
<p>undergraduate (or graduate) texts. There is a web site for this book, http://www-
</p>
<p>personal.umich.edu/~pberman/qmbook.html, that contains an Errata, Mathematica
</p>
<p>subroutines, and some additional material.
</p>
<p>The problems form an integral part of the book. Many are standard problems, but
</p>
<p>there are a few that might be unique to this text. Quantum mechanics is a difficult
</p>
<p>subject for beginning students. I often tell them that falling behind in a course such
</p>
<p>as this is a disease from which it is difficult to recover. In writing this book, my
</p>
<p>foremost task has been to keep the students in mind. On the other hand, I know
</p>
<p>that no textbook is a substitute for a dedicated instructor who guides, excites, and
</p>
<p>motivates students to understand the material.
</p>
<p>I would like to thank Bill Ford, Aaron Leanhardt, Peter Milonni, Michael Revzen,
</p>
<p>Alberto Rojo, and Robin Shakeshaft for their insightful comments. I would also like
</p>
<p>to acknowledge the many discussions I had with Duncan Steel on topics contained
</p>
<p>in this book. Finally, I am indebted to my students for their encouragement and
</p>
<p>positive (as well as negative) feedback over the years. I am especially grateful to
</p>
<p>the Fulbright foundation for having provided the support that allowed me to offer a
</p>
<p>course in quantum mechanics to students at the College of Science and Technology
</p>
<p>at the University of Rwanda. My interactions with these students will always remain
</p>
<p>an indelible chapter of my life.

<p>Chapter 1
</p>
<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>As a science or engineering major, you are about to embark on what may be the
</p>
<p>most important course of your undergraduate career. Quantum mechanics is the
</p>
<p>foundation on which our current picture of the structure of matter is built. For stu-
</p>
<p>dents, an introductory course in quantum mechanics can be difficult and frustrating.
</p>
<p>When you studied Newtonian physics, it was easy to envision experiments involving
</p>
<p>the motion of particles moving under the influence of forces. Electromagnetism
</p>
<p>and optics were a bit more abstract once the concept of fields was introduced,
</p>
<p>but you are familiar with many optical effects such as colors of thin films, the
</p>
<p>rainbow, and diffraction from single or double slits. In quantum mechanics, it is
</p>
<p>more difficult conceptually to understand what is going on since you have very little
</p>
<p>day to day experience with the wave nature of matter. However, you can exploit your
</p>
<p>knowledge of both classical mechanics and optics to get a better feel for quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics.
</p>
<p>I often begin a course in quantum mechanics asking students &ldquo;Why and when is
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics needed to explain the dynamics of a particle moving in a poten-
</p>
<p>tial. In other words, when does a classical particle description fail?&rdquo; To understand
</p>
<p>and appreciate many aspects of quantum mechanics, you should always have this
</p>
<p>and a few other questions in the back of your mind. Question two might be &ldquo;How
</p>
<p>is the quantum mechanical solution of a given problem related to the corresponding
</p>
<p>problem in classical mechanics?&rdquo; Question three could be &ldquo;Is there a problem in
</p>
<p>optics with which I am familiar that can shed light on a given problem in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics?&rdquo; You can add other questions to this list, but these are a good start.
</p>
<p>Another key point in the study of quantum mechanics is not to lose track of
</p>
<p>the physics. There are many special functions, such as Hermite and Laguerre
</p>
<p>polynomials, that emerge from solutions of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, and the
</p>
<p>algebra can get a little complicated. As long as you remind yourself of the physical
</p>
<p>nature of the solution rather than the mathematical details, you will be in great

<p>shape. The reason for this is that most of the solutions share many common features.
</p>
<p>The specific form of the solutions may change, but the overall qualitative nature of
</p>
<p>the solutions is remarkably similar for many different problems. Moreover, with
</p>
<p>the availability of symbolic manipulation programs such as Mathematica, Maple,
</p>
<p>or Matlab, it is now easy to plot and evaluate any of these functions using a few
</p>
<p>keystrokes.
</p>
<p>To help introduce the subject matter, I will present a very broad, qualitative
</p>
<p>overview of the way in which quantum mechanics was born, a birth that took about
</p>
<p>25&ndash;30 years. I will not worry about historical accuracy here, but simply try to give
</p>
<p>you a reasonable picture of the manner in which it became appreciated that a wave
</p>
<p>description of matter was needed in certain limits.
</p>
<p>1.1 Electromagnetic Waves
</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics is a wave theory. Since the wave properties of matter have
</p>
<p>many similarities to the wave properties of electromagnetic radiation, it won&rsquo;t hurt
</p>
<p>to review some of the fundamental properties of the electromagnetic field. The
</p>
<p>possible existence of electromagnetic waves followed from Maxwell&rsquo;s equations.
</p>
<p>By combining the equations of electromagnetism, Maxwell arrived at a wave
</p>
<p>equation, in which the wave propagation speed in vacuum was equal to v D
1=
p
�0�0, where �0 is the permittivity and �0 the permeability of free space. Since
</p>
<p>these were known quantities in the nineteenth century, it was a simple matter to
</p>
<p>calculate v; which turned out to equal the speed of light. This result led Maxwell to
</p>
<p>conjecture that light was an electromagnetic phenomenon.
</p>
<p>All electromagnetic waves travel in vacuum with speed c D 2:99792458 �
108 m/s, now defined as the speed of light. What distinguishes one type of
</p>
<p>electromagnetic wave from another is its wavelength � or frequency f , which are
</p>
<p>related by
</p>
<p>c D f�: (1.1)
</p>
<p>Instead of characterizing a wave by its frequency (which has units of cycles per
</p>
<p>second or Hz) and wavelength, we can equally well specify the angular frequency,
</p>
<p>! D 2� f , (which has units of radians per second or s�1) and the magnitude of the
propagation vector (or wave vector), defined by k D 2�=�. With these definitions,
Eq. (1.1) can be replaced by
</p>
<p>! D ck; (1.2)
</p>
<p>which is known as a dispersion relation, relating frequency to wave vector. For
</p>
<p>electromagnetic radiation in vacuum the dispersion relation is linear.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.1 Electromagnetic Waves 3
</p>
<p>The source of electromagnetic waves is oscillating or accelerating charges, which
</p>
<p>give rise to propagating electric and magnetic fields. The wave equation for the
</p>
<p>electric field vector E.R; t/ at position R at time t in vacuum is
</p>
<p>r2E.R; t/ D 1
c2
</p>
<p>@2E.R; t/
</p>
<p>@t2
: (1.3)
</p>
<p>The simplest solution of this equation is also the most important, since it is a
</p>
<p>building block solution from which all other solutions can be constructed. The
</p>
<p>building block solution of the wave equation is the infinite, monochromatic, plane
</p>
<p>wave solution, having an electric field vector given by
</p>
<p>E.R; t/ D �E0 cos .k � R � !t/ ; (1.4)
</p>
<p>where E0 is the field amplitude and the polarization of the field is specified by a
</p>
<p>unit vector � that is perpendicular to the propagation vector k of the field. There are
</p>
<p>two independent field polarizations possible for each propagation vector. The fact
</p>
<p>that ��k D 0 follows from the requirement that r � E.R;t/ D 0 in vacuum. The
field (1.4) corresponds to a wave that is infinite in extent and propagates in the k
</p>
<p>direction. Of course, no such wave exists in nature since it would uniformly fill all
</p>
<p>space.
</p>
<p>As a consequence of the linearity of the wave equation, the sum of any two
</p>
<p>solutions of the wave equation is also a solution. This is known as a superposition
</p>
<p>principle. It is not difficult to visualize how waves add together. If, at the same time
</p>
<p>you are putting your finger in and out of water in a lake, someone else is also putting
</p>
<p>their finger in and out of the water, the resulting wave results from the actions of
</p>
<p>both your fingers. The important thing to remember is that it is the displacements
</p>
<p>or amplitudes of the waves that add, not their intensities. The intensity of a wave is
</p>
<p>proportional to the square of the wave amplitude.
</p>
<p>For the time being, let us consider two waves having the same frequency and the
</p>
<p>same amplitude. If the two waves propagate in opposite directions, the total electric
</p>
<p>field vector is
</p>
<p>E.R; t/ D �E0 Œcos .k � R � !t/C cos .�k � R � !t/&#141;
D 2�E0 cos .!t/ cos .k � R/ ; (1.5)
</p>
<p>a standing wave pattern. If you plot the wave amplitude at several different times
</p>
<p>as a function of position, you will find that there is an envelope for the wave that
</p>
<p>is fixed in space&mdash;the wave &ldquo;stands&rdquo; there and oscillates within the envelope. The
</p>
<p>points of zero amplitude are called nodes of the field and the maxima (or minima)
</p>
<p>are called antinodes of the field. For a standing wave field in the x direction that is
</p>
<p>confined between two parallel mirrors separated by a distance L; the standing wave
</p>
<p>pattern will &ldquo;fit in&rdquo; for wavelengths equal to 2L; L, 2L=3; L=2, etc., as shown in</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1 Resonance involving standing waves with clamped endpoints
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1. In this limit, the tangential component of the electric field vanishes at the
</p>
<p>mirrors, as required by the boundary conditions on the field. The condition
</p>
<p>�n D 2L=n; n D 1; 2; 3; : : : : (1.6)
</p>
<p>is known as a resonance condition.
</p>
<p>1.1.1 Radiation Pulses
</p>
<p>To get a pulse of radiation, it is necessary to add together monochromatic waves
</p>
<p>having a continuous distribution of frequencies. It is easy to create a pulse of
</p>
<p>radiation. Simply turn a laser or other light source on and off and you have created
</p>
<p>a pulse. Why worry about the frequencies contained in the pulse? It turns out that it
</p>
<p>is important, even central, to understand this concept if you are going to have some
</p>
<p>idea of what quantum mechanics is about.
</p>
<p>Let us assume the pulse is propagating in the x direction and has a duration &#129;t
</p>
<p>corresponding to a spatial width&#129;x D c&#129;t. Clearly this cannot be a monochromatic
wave since a monochromatic wave is not localized. Instead, the pulse must be a
</p>
<p>superposition of waves having a range of frequencies &#129;f centered around some
</p>

<p>&#129;f and &#129;t are related by

<p>The quantity &#129;f is known as the spectral width of the pulse. If the frequency

<p>of the pulse is known precisely, as in a monochromatic wave, there is no range
</p>
<p>of frequencies and &#129;f D 0: In general there is a central frequency f0 in a pulse
and a range of frequencies &#129;f about that central frequency as shown in Fig. 1.2.
</p>
<p>If &#129;f � f0, then the frequency is pretty well-defined and the field is said to be
quasi-monochromatic. The field associated with the light of a green laser pointer</p>

pulse broadens, the temporal pulse width narrows
</p>
<p>and most other laser fields are quasi-monochromatic, as are the fields from neon
</p>
<p>discharge tubes. Radio waves are also quasi-monochromatic, the central frequency
</p>
<p>is the frequency of the station (about 1000 kHz for AM and 100 MHz for FM)
</p>
<p>broadcasting the signal. On the other hand, if &#129;f is comparable with f0, as in a light
</p>
<p>bulb, the source is said to be incoherent or broadband.
</p>
<p>For example, consider a pulse of green laser light that has an ns (10�9 s) duration,
&#129;t D 1 ns. The spatial extent of this pulse is 3 � 108 m/s � 10�9 s = 30 cm. The
frequency range in the pulse is given by

D 1:6 � 108 Hz. (1.8)
</p>
<p>Since the light from the green laser pointer has a central wavelength of 532 nm, it
</p>
<p>has a central frequency of about f0 D 5:6 � 1014 Hz. As a consequence, &#129;f � f0
and this pulse is quasi-monochromatic. That is, a one nanosecond pulse of this light
</p>
<p>appears to have a single frequency or color if you look at it. On the other hand, if
</p>
<p>you try to make a one femtosecond (fs) pulse with this light (1 fs = 10�15 s) which
has a spatial extent of 300 nm, then
</p>
<p>&#129;f D 1=

D 1:6 � 1014 Hz, (1.9)

<p>which is comparable to the central frequency. As a result this is a broadband pulse
</p>
<p>which no longer appears green, but closer to white. Note that the spatial extent of the</p>

<p>pulse, 300 nm is comparable to the central wavelength. This is an equivalent test for
</p>
<p>broadband radiation. If the spatial extent is comparable to the central wavelength,
</p>
<p>the radiation is broadband; if it is much larger than the central wavelength, it is
</p>
<p>quasi-monochromatic.
</p>
<p>1.1.2 Wave Diffraction
</p>
<p>The final topic that we will need to know something about is wave diffraction.
</p>
<p>Diffraction is a purely wave phenomenon, but sometimes waves don&rsquo;t appear to
</p>
<p>diffract at all. If you shine a laser beam at a tree or a pencil, it will reflect off of
</p>
<p>these and not bend around them. Moreover, if you shine a laser beam through an
</p>
<p>open door, it will not bend around into the hallway. Diffraction is only important
</p>
<p>when waves meet obstacles (including apertures or openings) that are comparable
</p>
<p>to or smaller than the central wavelength of the waves. This is actually true for the
</p>
<p>laser beam itself!&mdash;it will stay a beam of approximately constant diameter only if its
</p>
<p>diameter is much greater than its wavelength, otherwise, it will spread significantly.
</p>
<p>I can make this somewhat quantitative. Imagine there is a circular opening in
</p>
<p>a screen having diameter a through which a laser beam passes, or that it passes
</p>
<p>through a slit having width a, or that a laser beam having diameter a propagates in
</p>
<p>vacuum with no apertures present. In each of these cases, there is diffraction that
</p>
<p>leads to a spreading of the beam by an amount
</p>
<p>sin � � �
a
; (1.10)
</p>
<p>where � is the angle with which the beam spreads. If �=a � 1, the spreading
angle is very small and diffraction is relatively unimportant. This is the limit where
</p>
<p>the wave acts as a particle, moving on straight lines. On the other hand, when a
</p>
<p>gets comparable to a wavelength, the spreading of the beam becomes significant. If
</p>
<p>�=a &gt; 1, the spreading is over all angles. For example, if a pinhole is illuminated
</p>
<p>with light, you can see the diffracted light at any angle on the other side of the
</p>
<p>pinhole.
</p>
<p>Even if the diffraction angle is small, the effects can get large over long distances.
</p>
<p>If a laser beam having diameter 1.0 cm and central wavelength 600 nm is sent to the
</p>
<p>moon, the diffraction angle is

</p>
<p>or comparable to its wavelength, it will diffract significantly.
</p>
<p>1.2 BlackBody Spectrum: Origin of the Quantum Theory
</p>
<p>Thermodynamics was developed in the nineteenth century and involves the study
</p>
<p>of the properties of vapors, liquids, and solids in terms of such parameters
</p>
<p>as temperature, pressure, volume, density, conductivity, etc. At the end of the
</p>
<p>nineteenth century, the theory of statistical mechanics was formulated in which the
</p>
<p>properties of systems of particles are explained in terms of their statistical properties.
</p>
<p>It was shown that the two theories of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
</p>
<p>were consistent&mdash;one could explain macroscopic properties of vapors, liquids, and
</p>
<p>solids by considering them to be made up of a large number of particles following
</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s laws. One result of this theory is that for a system of particles (or waves) in
</p>
<p>thermodynamic equilibrium at a temperature T, each particle or wave has .1=2/kBT
</p>
<p>of energy for each &ldquo;degree of freedom.&rdquo; This is known as the equipartition theorem.
</p>
<p>The quantity kB D 1:38 � 10�23 J/ıK is Boltzmann&rsquo;s constant and T is the
absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin. A &ldquo;degree of freedom&rdquo; is related to an
</p>
<p>independent motion a particle can have (translation, rotation, vibration, etc.). For
</p>
<p>a free particle (no forces acting on it), there are three degrees of freedom, one
</p>
<p>for each independent direction of motion. For a transverse wave, there are two
</p>
<p>degrees of freedom, corresponding to the two possible independent directions for
</p>
<p>the polarization of the wave.
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century there was a problem in trying to
</p>
<p>formulate the theory of a blackbody. A blackbody is an object that, in equilibrium,
</p>
<p>absorbs and emits radiation at the same rate. At a given temperature, the radiation
</p>
<p>emitted by a blackbody is spread over a wide range of frequencies, but the peak
</p>
<p>intensity occurs at a wavelength �max governed by Wien&rsquo;s law,
</p>
<p>�maxT D 2:90 � 10�3 m �ı K, (1.13)
</p>
<p>where T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin. For example, the surface of the sun is
</p>
<p>about 5000 ıK. If the sun is approximated as a blackbody, then �max � 580 nm is in
the yellow part of the spectrum. As an object is heated it emits radiation at higher
</p>
<p>frequencies; an object that is &ldquo;blue&rdquo; hot is hotter than an object that is &ldquo;red&rdquo; hot.
</p>
<p>The experimental curve for emission from a blackbody as a function of wave-
</p>
<p>length is shown in Fig. 1.3. To try to explain this result, Rayleigh and Jeans
</p>
<p>considered a model for a blackbody consisting of a cavity with a small hole in
</p>
<p>it. Standing wave patterns of radiation fill the cavity and each standing wave has
</p>
<p>kBT of energy associated with it (kBT=2 for each independent polarization of the
</p>
<p>field). A standing wave pattern or mode is characterized by the number of (half)
</p>
<p>wavelengths in the x, y, and z directions. There is a maximum wavelength � D 2L in
each direction, but there is no limit on the minimum wavelength. Since the number</p>

</p>
<p>(hc=kBT)] for a blackbody. The maximum occurs at �max � hc= .5kBT/
</p>
<p>of small wavelength (high frequency) modes that can fit is arbitrarily large and since
</p>
<p>each mode has kBT of energy, the amount of energy needed to reach equilibrium
</p>
<p>becomes infinite. Another way of saying this is that the energy density (energy per
</p>
<p>unit frequency interval) approaches infinity as � � 0 or f � 1. The fact that it does
not take an infinite amount of energy to bring a blackbody into thermal equilibrium
</p>
<p>or that the energy density does not approach infinity at high frequencies is known as
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;ultraviolet catastrophe&rdquo;; theory and experiment were in disagreement for high
</p>
<p>or &ldquo;ultraviolet&rdquo; frequencies (smaller wavelengths) (see Fig. 1.3).
</p>
<p>Planck tried to overcome this difference by making an ad hoc hypothesis.1 In
</p>
<p>effect, he said, that to excite a mode of frequency f , a specific minimum amount of
</p>
<p>energy hf (h is defined below) is needed that must be provided in an all or nothing
</p>
<p>fashion by electrons oscillating in the cavity walls. This went against classical ideas
</p>
<p>that energy can be fed continuously to build up oscillation in a given mode. By
</p>
<p>adopting this theory, he found that he could explain the experimental data if he
</p>
<p>chose
</p>
<p>h D 6:63 � 10�34 J � s D 4:14 � 10�15 eV � s, (1.14)
</p>
<p>which is now known as Planck&rsquo;s constant [recall that one eV (electron-volt) is equal
</p>
<p>to 1:60�10�19 J (Joules)]. The quantum theory was born. Some details of the Planck
solution are given in the Appendix.

<p>radiation having �max D 500 nm corresponds to a blackbody temperature of T �
6; 000 ıK, about the temperature of the surface of the sun. In the visible part of the
spectrum, hf is of order of a few eV.
</p>
<p>In 1907, Einstein also used the Planck hypothesis to explain a feature that had
</p>
<p>been observed in the specific heat of solids as a function of temperature.2 Many
</p>
<p>solids have a specific heat at constant volume equal to 3R at room temperature;
</p>
<p>where R D 8:31 J/mole/ıK is the gas constant; however, some substances such as
diamond have a much lower specific heat. Based on a model of solids composed
</p>
<p>of harmonic oscillators, Einstein used Planck&rsquo;s radiation law to show that the
</p>
<p>contributions to the specific heat of diamond from the oscillations are &ldquo;frozen out&rdquo;
</p>
<p>at room temperature. To fit the data on diamond, Einstein used a value of 2:73�1013
Hz for the frequency of oscillations, which would imply that the vibrational degrees
</p>
<p>of freedom begin to diminish for temperatures below T D hf=kB � 1300 ıK and
are effectively frozen out for temperatures below T D hf= .2:82kB/ � 460 ıK.

<p>Thomson in 1897 and 1899, respectively, that electrons could be ejected from metal
</p>
<p>surfaces when light was shined on the surfaces. Einstein gave his explanation of the
</p>
<p>effect in 1905 (this explanation and not relativity theory was noted in his Nobel Prize

<p>10 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>citation) and further experiments by Millikan confirmed Einstein&rsquo;s explanation.
</p>
<p>It turns out that Einstein&rsquo;s explanation is not really evidence for photons, even
</p>
<p>though the authors of many textbooks assert this to be the case. To understand
</p>
<p>the photoelectric effect, it is necessary to know that different metals have different
</p>
<p>work functions. The work function (typically on the order of several eV) is the
</p>
<p>minimum energy needed to extract an electron from a metal surface. In some sense
</p>
<p>it is a measure of the height of a hill that the electron must climb to get out of the
</p>
<p>metal. From a physical perspective, when an electron leaves the surface, it creates
</p>
<p>an image charge inside the surface that attracts the charge back to the surface; the
</p>
<p>work function is the energy needed to escape from this attractive force.
</p>
<p>The experimental observations for the photoelectric effect can be summarized as
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>1. When yellow light is shined on a specific metal, no electrons are ejected.
</p>
<p>Increasing the intensity of the light still does not lead to electrons being ejected.
</p>
<p>2. When ultraviolet light is shined on the same metal, electrons are ejected. When
</p>
<p>the intensity of the ultraviolet radiation is increased, the number of electrons
</p>
<p>ejected increases, but the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons does
</p>
<p>not change.
</p>
<p>To explain these phenomena, Einstein stated that radiation consists of particles
</p>
<p>(subsequently given the name photons by the chemist Gilbert Lewis in 1926). For
</p>
<p>radiation of frequency f , the photons have energy hf . When such particles are
</p>
<p>incident on a metal surface, they excite the electrons by giving up their energy in an
</p>
<p>all or nothing fashion. Thus, if the work function is denoted by W, the frequency of
</p>
<p>the radiation must satisfy hf &gt; W for the radiation to cause electrons to be ejected.
</p>
<p>If hf &lt; W, the photons cannot excite the electrons, no matter what the intensity
</p>
<p>of the field&mdash;this explains why increasing the intensity of the yellow light does not
</p>
<p>lead to electrons being ejected. On the other hand, if hf &gt; W, the photon can excite
</p>
<p>the electron with any extra energy going into kinetic energy KE of the electrons
</p>
<p>(some of which may be lost on collisions). Thus the maximum energy of the emitted
</p>
<p>electrons is
</p>
<p>KEmax D hf �W: (1.18)
</p>
<p>Increasing the intensity of the radiation does not change this maximum kinetic
</p>
<p>energy since it results from single photon events, it affects only the intensity of
</p>
<p>the emitted electrons.
</p>
<p>1.4 Bohr Theory
</p>
<p>By 1910, it was known that there existed negatively charged particles having charge
</p>
<p>�e equal to �1:6� 10�19 C and mass m equal to 9:1� 10�31 kg. Moreover, the size
of these particles could be estimated using theoretical arguments related to their</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.4 Bohr Theory 11
</p>
<p>energy content to be about 10�15 m. From atomic densities and measurements in
gases, atoms were known to have a size of about 10�10 m. Since matter is neutral,
there must be positively charged particles in atoms that cancel the negative charge.
</p>
<p>But how were the charges arranged? Was the positive charge spread out over a
</p>
<p>large sphere and the negative charge embedded in it or was there something like
</p>
<p>a planetary model for atoms? This question was put to rest in 1909 by Geiger
</p>
<p>and Madsen who collided alpha particles (helium nuclei that are produced in
</p>
<p>radioactivity) on thin metal foils. They found &ldquo;back-scattering&rdquo; that indicated the
</p>
<p>positive charges were small. In 1911 Rutherford analyzed the data and estimated
</p>
<p>the positive charges to have a size on the order of 10�15 m. He then proposed a
planetary model of the atom in which the electron orbited the positive nucleus.
</p>
<p>However, there were problems in planetary&mdash;model&mdash;ville. It is easy to cal-
</p>
<p>culate that an accelerating electron in orbit around the nucleus should radiate its
</p>
<p>energy in about a nanosecond, yet atoms were stable. Moreover, the spectrum of
</p>
<p>radiation emitted by the hydrogen atom consisted of a number of discrete (quasi-
</p>
<p>monochromatic) lines, but accelerating electrons in different orbits should produce
</p>
<p>a broadband source of radiation. How could this be explained?
</p>
<p>To explain the experimental data within the context of the planetary model, Bohr
</p>
<p>in 1913 came up with the following postulates:
</p>
<p>1. The electron orbits the nucleus in circular orbits (back to Ptolemy and Coperni-
</p>
<p>cus) having discrete values of angular momentum given by
</p>
<p>L D mvr D n&bdquo;; (1.19)
</p>
<p>where n D 1; 2; 3; 4; : : : (actually he formulated the law in terms of energy
rather than angular momentum, but the two methods yield the same results).
</p>
<p>The quantity r is the radius of the orbit, v is the electron&rsquo;s speed, and L is the
</p>
<p>magnitude of the angular momentum. The mass in this equation should actually
</p>
<p>be the reduced mass of the electron which is smaller than the electron mass by a
</p>
<p>factor of 1=1:00054:
</p>
<p>2. The electrons radiate energy only when they &ldquo;jump&rdquo; from a larger to a smaller
</p>
<p>orbit. The frequency of the radiation emitted is given by
</p>
<p>fn2;n1 D
En2 � En1
</p>
<p>h
; (1.20)
</p>
<p>where Eni is the energy associated with an orbit having angular momentum L D
ni&bdquo;.
Although these are seemingly benign postulates, they have extraordinary con-
</p>
<p>sequences. To begin with, I combine the first postulate with the laws of electrical
</p>
<p>attraction and Newton&rsquo;s second law. The magnitude of the electrostatic force on the

<p>also &ldquo;explained&rdquo; the stability of the hydrogen atom, since an electron in the n D 1
orbital had nowhere to go.
</p>
<p>Thus, Bohr&rsquo;s theory explained in quantitative terms the spectrum of hydrogen.
</p>
<p>That is, the Bohr theory gave very good agreement with the experimental values
</p>
<p>for the frequencies of the emitted lines. Bohr theory leads to correct predictions for
</p>
<p>the emitted frequencies because Bohr got the energies right. The Bohr theory also
</p>
<p>predicts the correct characteristic values for the radius and speed of the electron in
</p>
<p>the various orbits. As we shall see, however, the radius and speed are not quantized
</p>
<p>in a correct theory of the hydrogen atom. Moreover, while angular momentum is
</p>
<p>quantized in the quantum theory, the allowed quantized values for the magnitude of
</p>
<p>the angular momentum differ somewhat from those given by the Bohr theory.
</p>
<p>1.5 De Broglie Waves
</p>
<p>It turns out that the photoelectric effect and quantization conditions of the Bohr
</p>
<p>theory of the hydrogen atom can be explained if one allows for the possibility that
</p>
<p>matter is described by a wave equation. The first suggestion of this type originates
</p>
<p>with the work of Louis de Broglie in 1923. The basic idea is to explain the stable</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>orbits of the electron in the hydrogen atom as a repeating wave pattern. Just what
</p>
<p>type of wave remains to be seen. De Broglie actually arrived at a wavelength for
</p>
<p>matter using two different approaches.
</p>
<p>First let us consider the circular orbits of the electron in hydrogen, for which
</p>
<p>Ln D mvnrn D n&bdquo;: If we imagine that an orbit fits in n wavelengths of matter, then
</p>
<p>n .�dB/n D 2�rn D
nh
</p>
<p>mvn
; (1.33)
</p>
<p>where �dB is the de Broglie wavelength. Solving for �dB, I find
</p>
<p>.�dB/n D
h
</p>
<p>mvn
: (1.34)
</p>
<p>Thus, if we assign a wavelength to matter equal to Planck&rsquo;s constant divided by
</p>
<p>the momentum of the particle, then the wave will &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; in its circular orbit. If
</p>
<p>Planck&rsquo;s constant were equal to zero, there would be no wave-like properties to
</p>
<p>matter.
</p>
<p>De Broglie reached this result in another manner starting with Einstein&rsquo;s theory
</p>
<p>of relativity, combined with aspects of the photoelectric effect. In special relativity
</p>
<p>the equation for the length of the momentum-energy 4-vector is
</p>
<p>p2c2 � E2 D m2c4; (1.35)
</p>
<p>where p is the momentum, m the mass, and E the energy of the particle. If I apply
</p>
<p>this equation to &ldquo;particles&rdquo; of light having zero mass, I find p D E=c, which relates
the momentum and energy of light. Considering light of frequency f to be composed
</p>
<p>of photons having energy E D hf , we are led to the conclusion that the momentum
of a photon is p D E=c D hf=c D h=�, where � is the wavelength of the light. Thus,
for photons, � D h=p. De Broglie then suggested that this is the correct prescription
for assigning a wavelength to matter as well.
</p>
<p>You can calculate the de Broglie wavelength of any macroscopic object and
</p>
<p>will find that it is extremely small compared with atomic dimensions. Since the
</p>
<p>de Broglie wavelength of macroscopic matter is much smaller than the size of an
</p>
<p>atom, macroscopic matter could exhibit its wave-like properties only if it encounters
</p>
<p>interaction potentials that vary on such a scale, an unlikely scenario. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, if you calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the electron in the ground state
</p>
<p>of hydrogen, you will find a value close to the Bohr radius. Since the electron is
</p>
<p>confined to a distance on the order of its wavelength, it exhibits wave-like properties.
</p>
<p>In 1927, Davisson and Germer observed the diffraction and interference of
</p>
<p>electron waves interacting with a single crystal of nickel, providing confirmation
</p>
<p>of the de Broglie hypothesis. About the same time Schr&ouml;dinger was formulating a
</p>
<p>wave theory of quantum mechanics. The wave theory of matter was born!</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.6 The Schr&ouml;dinger Equation and Probability Waves 15
</p>
<p>1.6 The Schr&ouml;dinger Equation and Probability Waves
</p>
<p>With de Broglie&rsquo;s hypothesis, it is not surprising that scientists tried to develop
</p>
<p>theories in which matter was described by a wave equation. In 1927, Schr&ouml;dinger
</p>
<p>developed such a theory at the same time that Heisenberg was developing a theory
</p>
<p>based on matrices. Eventually the two theories were shown to be equivalent. I will
</p>
<p>focus on the Schr&ouml;dinger approach in this discussion; the matrix approach is similar
</p>
<p>to Dirac&rsquo;s formalism, which is discussed in Chap. 11.
</p>
<p>The Schr&ouml;dinger equation is a partial differential equation for a function  .r; t/
</p>
<p>which is called the wave function. Before thinking about how to interpret the
</p>
<p>wave function, it is useful to describe how to solve the Schr&ouml;dinger equation. The
</p>
<p>Schr&ouml;dinger equation is different than the wave equation for electromagnetic waves,
</p>
<p>although there are some similarities. To solve the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, one must
</p>
<p>find the &ldquo;building block&rdquo; solutions, that is, those solutions analogous to the infinite
</p>
<p>plane monochromatic waves that served as the building block solutions of the wave
</p>
<p>equation in electromagnetism. The building block solutions of the Schr&ouml;dinger
</p>
<p>equation are called eigenfunctions. Eigenfunctions or eigenstates are solutions of
</p>
<p>the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for which j .r; t/j2 is constant in time. It is not obvious
that such solutions exist, but it can be shown that they always can be found. The
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions are labeled by eigenvalues which correspond to dynamic constants
</p>
<p>of the motion such as energy, momentum, angular momentum, etc. Let me give you
</p>
<p>some examples.
</p>
<p>A free particle is a particle on which no forces act. For such a particle both
</p>
<p>momentum p D mv and energy E D mv2=2 are constant. Thus momentum and
energy can be used as eigenvalue labels for a free particle. But which is a more
</p>
<p>encompassing label? I can write the energy of the free particle as E D p2=2m. If I
give you the momentum, you can tell me the energy. On the other hand, if I give you
</p>
<p>the energy you can tell me the magnitude of the momentum, but not its direction.
</p>
<p>Thus momentum uniquely determines the eigenfunction since, to each momentum,
</p>
<p>there is associated exactly one eigenstate. On the other hand, for a given energy there
</p>
<p>is an infinite number of eigenstates since the momentum can be in any direction. In
</p>
<p>this case the eigenfunctions or eigenstates are said to be infinitely degenerate. We
</p>
<p>will see that whenever there is a degeneracy of this type, there is an underlying
</p>
<p>symmetry of nature. In this case there is translational symmetry, since the particle
</p>
<p>can move in any direction without experiencing a change the force acting on it (since
</p>
<p>there is no force). The eigenfunctions for the free particle are our old friends, infinite
</p>
<p>plane waves, but they differ from electromagnetic waves. The wavelength of the free
</p>
<p>particle waves is just the de Broglie wavelength � D h=p&mdash;one momentum implies
one wavelength. Thus it is the momentum that determines the wavelength of the free
</p>
<p>particle eigenfunctions.
</p>
<p>For the bound states of the hydrogen atom, the electron is subjected to a force
</p>
<p>so that momentum is not constant and cannot be used as a label for the hydrogen
</p>
<p>atom eigenfunctions. On the other hand, angular momentum is conserved for any
</p>
<p>central force. For reasons to be discussed in Chap. 9, the three components of the
</p>
<p>angular momentum vector cannot be used to label the eigenfunctions; instead, the
</p>
<p>magnitude of the angular momentum and one of its components are used.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Let me return to the free particle. What is the significance of the wave function
</p>
<p>j .r; t/j2? The interpretation given is that j .r; t/j2 is the probability density
(probability per unit volume) to find the particle at position r at time t. To give
</p>
<p>you some idea of what this means, imagine throwing darts at a wall. You throw one
</p>
<p>dart and it hits somewhere on the wall. Now you throw a second and a third dart.
</p>
<p>Now you throw a million darts. After a million darts, you will have a pretty good
</p>
<p>idea where the next dart will land&mdash;in other words, you will know the probability
</p>
<p>distribution for where the darts will land. This will not tell you where the next dart
</p>
<p>will hit, only the probability. The probability of hitting a specific point is essentially
</p>
<p>equal to zero&mdash;you must talk about the probability density (in this case, probability
</p>
<p>per unit area). In quantum mechanics we have something similar. You prepare a
</p>
<p>quantum system in some initial state. At some later time you measure the particle
</p>
<p>somewhere. Now you start with an identical initial state, wait the same amount of
</p>
<p>time and measure the particle again. You repeat this a very large number of times and
</p>
<p>you will have the probability distribution to find the particle at a time t after it was
</p>
<p>prepared in this state. This will not tell you where the particle will be the next time
</p>
<p>you do the experiment&mdash;only the probability. If you send single particles, acting as
</p>
<p>waves, through the two-slit apparatus, each particles will set off only one detector
</p>
<p>on the screen. If you repeat this many times however, eventually you will build up
</p>
<p>the same type of interference pattern that occurs in the double slit experiment for
</p>
<p>light.4
</p>
<p>Since the eigenfunctions for a free particle are infinite mono-energetic (single
</p>
<p>momentum or velocity) waves, the probability density associated with the free
</p>
<p>particle eigenfunction is constant over the entire universe! In other words, the
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of the free particle are spread out over all space. Clearly no such
</p>
<p>state exists. Any free particles that we observe in nature are in a superposition state
</p>
<p>that is referred to as a wave packet, which is the matter analogue of a radiation
</p>
<p>pulse. As with radiation, we make up a superposition state by adding several
</p>
<p>waves or eigenfunctions together. But radiation pulses and wave packets differ in
</p>
<p>a fundamental way. All frequency components of a radiation pulse propagate at
</p>
<p>the same speed in vacuum, the speed of light. For a free particle wave packet,
</p>
<p>the different eigenfunctions that compose the wave packet correspond to different
</p>
<p>wavelengths, which, in turn, implies that they correspond to different momenta,
</p>
<p>since wavelength for matter waves is related to momentum. Thus different parts of a
</p>
<p>free particle wave packet move at different rates&mdash;the wave packet&rsquo;s shape changes
</p>
<p>in time! In the case of matter waves, Eq. (1.7) is replaced by
</p>

<p>packet. Equation (1.36) is a mathematical expression of the famous Heisenberg
</p>
<p>Uncertainty Principle.
</p>
<p>Matter can be considered to be &ldquo;particle-like&rdquo; as long as it is not confined it to
</p>
<p>a distance less than its de Broglie wavelength. If a particle is confined to a distance
</p>
<p>on the order of its de Broglie wavelength or encounters changes in potential energy
</p>
<p>that vary significantly in distances of order of its de Broglie wavelength, the particle
</p>
<p>exhibits wave-like properties.
</p>
<p>1.7 Measurement and Superposition States
</p>
<p>Measurement is one of the most difficult and frustrating features of quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics. The problem is that the measuring apparatus itself must be classical and
</p>
<p>not described by quantum mechanics. You will hear about &ldquo;wave-function collapse&rdquo;
</p>
<p>and the like, but quantum mechanics does not describe the dynamics in which a
</p>
<p>quantum state is measured by a classical apparatus. As long as you ask questions
</p>
<p>related to the probability of one or a succession of measurements, you need not run
</p>
<p>into any problems.
</p>
<p>1.7.1 What Is Truly Strange About Quantum Mechanics:
</p>
<p>Superposition States
</p>
<p>When I discussed electromagnetic waves, I showed that a superposition of plane
</p>
<p>wave states can result in a radiation pulse. There is nothing unusual about a radiation
</p>
<p>pulse. However, for quantum-mechanical waves, the superposition of eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>can sometimes lead to what at first appears to be rather strange results. The
</p>
<p>strangeness is most readily apparent if we look at the electrons in atoms or other
</p>
<p>quantum particles that are in a superposition of such bound states. Consider the
</p>
<p>electron in the hydrogen atom. It is possible for the electron to be in a superposition
</p>
<p>of two or more of its energy states (just as a free particle can be in a superposition of
</p>
<p>momentum eigenstates). Imagine that you prepare the electron in a superposition of
</p>
<p>its n D 1 and n D 2 energy states. What does this mean? If you measure the energy
of the electron you will get either �13:6 eV or �3:4 eV. If you prepare the electron
in the same manner and again measure the energy, you will get either �13:6 eV
or �3:4 eV. After many measurements on identically prepared electrons, you will
know the relative probability that the electron will be measured in the n D 1 state
or the n D 2 state. You might think that sometimes the electron was prepared in the
n D 1 state and sometimes in the n D 2 state, but this is not the case since it is
assumed that the electron is always prepared in an identical manner which can yield
</p>
<p>either measurement&mdash;that is, it is in a superposition state of the n D 1 and n D 2
states. When you measure the energy, some people (myself excluded) like to say that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>the wave function collapses into the state corresponding to the energy you measure.
</p>
<p>I would say that quantum mechanics just allows you to predict the probabilities for
</p>
<p>various measurements and cannot provide answers to questions regarding how the
</p>
<p>wave function evolves when a measurement is made.
</p>
<p>The idea that the observer forces a quantum system into a given state has led to
</p>
<p>some interesting, but what I consider misleading, ideas. Perhaps the most famous is
</p>
<p>the question of &ldquo;Who killed Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s cat?&rdquo; In the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; scenario, a cat is put
</p>
<p>into a box with a radioactive nucleus. If the nucleus decays, it emits a particle that
</p>
<p>activates a mechanism to release a poisonous gas. Since the nucleus is said to be in
</p>
<p>a superposition state of having decayed and not having decayed, the cat is also said
</p>
<p>to be in a superposition state of being dead and alive! Only by looking into the box
</p>
<p>does the observer know if the nucleus has decayed. In other words, the observation
</p>
<p>forces the nucleus into either its decayed or undecayed state. Thus it appears that
</p>
<p>looking into the box can result in the death of the cat.
</p>
<p>My feeling is that this is all a lot of nonsense. The reason that it is nonsense
</p>
<p>is somewhat technical, however. When the nucleus decays, it emits a gamma ray,
</p>
<p>so the appropriate superposition state must include this radiated field as well. The
</p>
<p>transition from initial state to the decayed state plus gamma ray essentially occurs
</p>
<p>instantaneously, even though the time at which the decay occurs follows statistical
</p>
<p>laws. Thus when you look into the box, the cat is either alive or it is dead, but not in
</p>
<p>a superposition state. In other words, the health of the cat is a measure of whether
</p>
<p>or not the nucleus has decayed, but the cat itself is not in a superposition state. On
</p>
<p>many similarly prepared systems, you will simply find that the cat dies at different
</p>
<p>times according to some statistical law. You needn&rsquo;t worry about being convicted of
</p>
<p>&ldquo;catacide&rdquo; if you open the box.
</p>
<p>Note that if it were true that you could force the nucleus into a given state by
</p>
<p>observing it, you could prevent the nucleus from decaying simply by looking at it
</p>
<p>continuously! Since it starts in its initial state and you continuously force it to stay in
</p>
<p>its initial state by looking at it, it never decays. This is known as the Zeno effect, in
</p>
<p>analogue with Zeno&rsquo;s paradoxes. It should be pointed out that it is possible to keep
</p>
<p>certain quantum systems in a given state by continuous observation. As long as you
</p>
<p>make measurements on the system on a time scale that is short compared with the
</p>
<p>time scale with which the system will evolve into a superposition state, you can keep
</p>
<p>the system in its initial state. For the decay of particles, however, the transition from
</p>
<p>initial to final states occurs essentially instantaneously and it is impossible to use
</p>
<p>continuous &ldquo;measurements&rdquo; to keep the particle in its undecayed state. I return to a
</p>
<p>discussion of the Zeno effect in Chap. 24.
</p>
<p>1.7.2 The EPR Paradox and Bell&rsquo;s Theorem
</p>
<p>Although a single quantum system in a superposition state has no classical analogue
</p>
<p>and already represents a strange animal, things get really strange when we consider
</p>
<p>two, interacting quantum systems that are prepared in a specific manner.</p>

<p>1.7 Measurement and Superposition States 19
</p>
<p>1.7.2.1 The EPR Paradox
</p>
<p>In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) published a paper entitled Can
</p>
<p>Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete,
</p>
<p>which has played an important role in the development of quantum mechanics.5 For
</p>
<p>an excellent account of this paper and others related to it, see Quantum Paradoxes
</p>
<p>and Physical Reality by Franco Selleri.6 In their paper, EPR first pose questions as
</p>
<p>to what constitutes a satisfactory theory: &ldquo;Is the theory correct? Is the description
</p>
<p>given by the theory complete? They then go on to define what they mean by an
</p>
<p>element of physical reality: If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can
</p>
<p>predict with certainty (i.e. with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical
</p>
<p>quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this
</p>
<p>physical quantity.&rdquo; Based on this definition and giving an example in which the wave
</p>
<p>function corresponds to an eigenfunction of one of two non-commuting operators,7
</p>
<p>they conclude that &ldquo;either (1) the quantum-mechanical description of reality given
</p>
<p>by the wave function is not complete or (2) when the operators corresponding to two
</p>
<p>physical quantities do not commute the two quantities cannot have simultaneous
</p>
<p>reality.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>To illustrate the EPR paradox, one can consider the decay of a particle into two
</p>
<p>identical particles. The initial particle has no intrinsic spin angular momentum,
</p>
<p>whereas each of the emitted particles has a spin angular momentum of 1=2 (spin
</p>
<p>angular momentum is discussed in Chap. 12). The spin of the emitted particles
</p>
<p>can be either &ldquo;up&rdquo; or &ldquo;down&rdquo; relative to some quantization axis, but the sum of
</p>
<p>the components of spin relative to this axis must equal zero to conserve angular
</p>
<p>momentum ( the spin of the original particle is zero so the total spin of the composite
</p>
<p>particles must be zero). The particles are emitted in opposite directions to conserve
</p>
<p>linear momentum and in a superposition of two states, a state in which one particle
</p>
<p>(particle A) has spin up and the other (particle B/ has spin down plus a state in which
</p>
<p>one particle (particle A) has spin down and the other (particle B/ has spin up, written
</p>
<p>symbolically as
</p>
<p>j i D 1p
2
.j"#i � j#"i/ ; (1.37)
</p>
<p>where " refers to spin up and # to spin down. The spin states of the two particles
are said to be correlated or entangled.
</p>
<p>Consider the situation in which the particles are emitted in this correlated state
</p>
<p>and fly off so they are light years apart. According to quantum mechanics, the spin
</p>
<p>of each of the particles (by &ldquo;spin,&rdquo; I now mean either up or down) is not fixed until

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>it is measured. In other words, the spin of each of the particles can be either up or
</p>
<p>down. If you don&rsquo;t measure the spin of particle A, the spin of particle B will be either
</p>
<p>up or down when measured relative to the z-axis. However, if you measure the spin
</p>
<p>of particle (A) to be up relative to the z-axis, you are guaranteed that particle (B) will
</p>
<p>have its spin down relative to the z-axis.
</p>
<p>Of course you are free to measure the spin component of particle A along any
</p>
<p>axis. If you measure the spin of particle A as up relative to the z-axis, the spin of
</p>
<p>particle B will have physical reality along the�z direction. On the other hand, if you
measure the spin of particle A as up relative to the x-axis, the spin of particle B will
</p>
<p>have physical reality along the �x direction. This is a situation in which both states
of particle B correspond to the same physical reality and these states correspond to
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of non-commuting spin operators, which is not allowed in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics. Since this outcome violates condition (2) stated above, the conclusion
</p>
<p>in EPR is that quantum mechanics is not a complete theory. This is known as the
</p>
<p>EPR paradox.
</p>
<p>In the conventional description of quantum mechanics, there is no paradox. For
</p>
<p>these correlated states, the probability that you measure a spin down for the second
</p>
<p>particle after you have measured a spin up for the first particle is unity when both
</p>
<p>spins are measured relative to the same axis. Quantum mechanics does not tell you
</p>
<p>why this is the case or how it occurs, it just gives the probability for the outcome.
</p>
<p>The idea of one measurement influencing the other is not particularly useful or
</p>
<p>meaningful.
</p>
<p>According to EPR, the state represented by Eq. (1.37) cannot represent the
</p>
<p>complete state of the system. Although it is nowhere mentioned in their paper,
</p>
<p>one often interprets this to imply that there must be additional labels or hidden
</p>
<p>variables needed in Eq. (1.37) In other words, there are some variables encoded
</p>
<p>in the quantum system that determine the outcome of the measurements. Quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics was inconsistent with EPR&rsquo;s element of reality, but a hidden variables
</p>
<p>theory might be. Which is right?
</p>
<p>1.7.2.2 Bell&rsquo;s Theorem
</p>
<p>The EPR paradox was and continues to be disturbing to some physicists. The
</p>
<p>idea that a measurement on one physical system can influence the outcome of
</p>
<p>a measurement on another system that is not causally connected with it can be
</p>
<p>somewhat unnerving. Motivated by the issues raised by the EPR paradox, John
</p>
<p>Bell in 1964 published a paper in which he discussed the idea of elements of
</p>
<p>reality.8 Without any reference to quantum mechanics, he was able to prove that
</p>
<p>certain inequalities must be obeyed on measurements of correlated systems to be

</p>
<p>consistent with the EPR idea of physical reality. In other words, if Bell&rsquo;s inequalities
</p>
<p>are violated, then physical observables may not have physical reality of the type
</p>
<p>described by EPR, independent of whether or not quantum mechanics is a valid
</p>
<p>theory. It turns out that there are now experiments in which Bell&rsquo;s inequalities
</p>
<p>are violated. Moreover, the results of these experiments are correctly predicted by
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics. I will give a proof of Bell&rsquo;s theorem and discuss examples
</p>
<p>in Chap. 13. Although Bell&rsquo;s theorem is generally accepted, there are some who
</p>
<p>question its validity.
</p>
<p>Measurement in quantum mechanics is a subject that continues to attract a great
</p>
<p>deal of attention. At this level, maybe it&rsquo;s better not to worry about it too much and
</p>
<p>instead concentrate on mastering the basic elements of the quantum theory. In the
</p>
<p>words of Richard Feynman (or not),9 Shut up and calculate!
</p>
<p>1.8 Summary
</p>
<p>In this chapter, I gave a qualitative introduction to several aspects of the quantum
</p>
<p>theory that we will encounter in the following chapters. As I stated, quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics is challenging the first go-around for many students. To help master
</p>
<p>the material it is important to try as many of the problems as possible. It can also
</p>
<p>help to consult other texts that may treat the material in a different fashion that you
</p>
<p>find more accessible. To begin, it may prove useful to review some mathematical
</p>
<p>concepts. You can skip Chap. 2 if you are familiar with these concepts.
</p>
<p>1.9 Appendix: Blackbody Spectrum
</p>
<p>Blackbody radiation is discussed in almost every quantum mechanics textbook, but
</p>
<p>the manner in which a blackbody achieves thermal equilibrium is almost never
</p>
<p>discussed. I will return to this question after discussing the equilibrium blackbody
</p>
<p>spectrum. There are essentially two ways to derive the blackbody spectrum. One
</p>
<p>employs the quantum statistics of a Bose gas plus some additional assumptions
</p>
<p>(radiation is described by Bose statistics and the energy of a photon having
</p>
<p>frequency ! is &bdquo;!). Since you will see such a treatment in your course on statistical
mechanics, I give an alternative derivation, more along the lines given by Planck.
</p>
<p>The first step is to get the distribution of radiation field modes in a box, each of
</p>
<p>whose sides has length L: There are two ways of doing this, both giving the same
</p>
<p>final density of states of the radiation field.

</p>
<p>1.9.1 Box Normalization with Field Nodes on the Walls
</p>
<p>In this case I assume that either the electric or magnetic field has a node on the
</p>
<p>perfectly conducting walls of a metal cavity which is bounded by 0 � x � L,
0 � y � L, 0 � z � L. For the appropriate field to vanish at the boundaries, the field
mode function must be of the form sin .kxx/, sin

; (1.38c)
</p>
<p>where nx; ny; nz, are positive integers [note that sin
�

</p>
<p>�
and sin
</p>
<p>�
��x
</p>
<p>L
</p>
<p>�
correspond
</p>
<p>to the same mode, differing only by a phase factor]. The field propagation vector is
</p>
<p>given by
</p>
<p>k D kxux C kxuy C kxuz; (1.39)
</p>
<p>where uj (j D x; y; z) is a unit vector in the j-direction. The angular frequency ! of
a field mode is equal to kc, where k D
</p>
<p>q
k2x C k2y C k2z .
</p>
<p>Thus, it follows from ! D kc that

</p>
<p>Each set of values (nx; ny; nz) corresponds to a given mode of the field. If there are
</p>
<p>many modes, I can replace the discrete modes by a continuum, essentially making n
</p>
<p>a continuous variable with ! D kc D �cn=L. In other words, the number of modes
in a shell having inner radius n and outer radius nC dn is simply 2 1

<p>mode,

<p>1.9.2 Periodic Boundary Conditions
</p>
<p>In this case I assume that either the electric or magnetic field is subject to periodic
</p>
<p>boundary conditions in which the field values repeat at spatial intervals L in
</p>
<p>each direction. Since the field phase of a monochromatic wave varies as eik�r this
implies that

</p>
<p>1.9.3 Rayleigh-Jeans Law
</p>
<p>To get the Rayleigh-Jeans law one simply assigns an energy of kBT to each mode,
</p>
<p>resulting in an energy density u.!/ (energy per unit volume per unit frequency !/
</p>
<p>given by
</p>
<p>u.!/ D kBT
!2
</p>
<p>�2c3
: (1.48)
</p>
<p>Clearly, the energy density diverges at large frequency; this is known as the
</p>
<p>ultraviolet catastrophe.
</p>
<p>1.9.4 Planck&rsquo;s Solution
</p>
<p>Implicit in the equipartition theorem is the assumption that each mode or degree
</p>
<p>of freedom can have a continuous energy distribution. In other words for the
</p>
<p>radiation modes in a cavity the energy distribution at temperature T , assumed to
</p>
<p>be a Boltzmann distribution, is
</p>
<p>W.E/ D 1
kBT
</p>
<p>e�E=kBT ; (1.49)
</p>
<p>which has been normalized such that
</p>
<p>Z 1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>W.E/dE D 1: (1.50)
</p>
<p>You can verify that

Z 1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>EW.E/dE D kBT; (1.51)
</p>
<p>is independent of frequency, for these modes.
</p>
<p>To explain the blackbody spectrum, Planck conjectured that the energies of the
</p>
<p>modes were discrete rather than continuous. A mode having frequency ! could have
</p>
<p>only those energies that are an integral multiple of a constant &bdquo; times !: In other
words, there is now a separate energy distribution for each mode having frequency
</p>
<p>!. The probability of having energy n&bdquo;! in a mode having frequency ! is given by
</p>
<p>W.n; !/ D Ae�n&bdquo;!=kBT ; (1.52)</p>

<p>The reason for the difference is that Wien&rsquo;s law is derived from the energy density

<p>1.9.5 Approach to Equilibrium
</p>
<p>Let me now return to the question of the approach to equilibrium. Consider first
</p>
<p>a box with two point particles, one at rest somewhere in the box and one having
</p>
<p>speed v0 and energy E0 D mv20=2 located at some other position in the box. The</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>collisions between particles and between the particles and the walls are assumed
</p>
<p>to be perfectly elastic. You might think that, on average, each particle will have
</p>
<p>energy E0=2 if you wait long enough, but this is not true. There are many initial
</p>
<p>conditions that will not result in collisions between the particles. For a given set of
</p>
<p>initial conditions, the dynamics is perfectly determined.
</p>
<p>As the number of particles in the box increases to a very large number, it becomes
</p>
<p>more and more likely that all the atoms undergo collisions at a rapid rate. In this case,
</p>
<p>the equilibrium distribution is Maxwellian. Returning to the modes of the radiation
</p>
<p>field in the cavity, there is no obvious way they can exchange energy to achieve
</p>
<p>equilibrium. They must exchange energy with the charges in the cavity walls. Thus
</p>
<p>one is faced with modeling this interaction and then having some model for the
</p>
<p>energy distribution of the charges in the cavity. As far as I know, no one has ever
</p>
<p>solved this approach to equilibrium in a satisfactory manner.
</p>

<p>1. What is the ultraviolet catastrophe and how did it lead to Planck&rsquo;s quantum

<p>energy of the four lowest energy states. Also indicate the radius, electron velocity,
</p>
<p>and angular momentum of these states as given by the Bohr theory.
</p>
<p>5. Calculate the wavelength of the n D 7 to n D 2 and of the n D 3 to n D 2
transitions in hydrogen. What frequency of radiation is needed to excite a hydrogen

<p>atom from its n D 1 to n D 3 state? How much energy is required to ionize a
hydrogen atom from its n D 2 state?
6. Radiation from the n D 2 to n D 1 state of hydrogen is incident on a metal
having a work function of 2.4 eV. What is the maximum energy of the electrons

particle duality of matter? What determines when matter acts as a particle and when
</p>
<p>it acts as a wave?</p>

<p>9. In general terms, discuss the measurement process in quantum mechanics. Why

<p>is it necessary to make measurements on a large number of identically prepared

is a single particle in a superposition state an intrinsically quantum object?

<p>a detector vs detector position look like? Explain.
</p>
<p>11. When light is incident on a glass slab, some of the light is reflected. This is a
</p>
<p>wave-like phenomenon (if a classical particle encounters a change in potential, it
</p>
<p>simply slows down or speeds up with no reflection), even though this corresponds
</p>
<p>to a geometrical optics limit (neglect of diffraction). Why does a wave-like effect

<p>Mathematical Preliminaries
</p>
<p>Anyone taking a course in quantum mechanics usually has had several semesters of
</p>
<p>calculus and some additional advanced courses in mathematics and mathematical
</p>
<p>physics. In this chapter I review briefly some of the mathematical concepts we will
</p>
<p>need in our study of quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>2.1 Complex Function of a Real Variable
</p>
<p>Since the wave function in quantum mechanics is complex, I will often be dealing
</p>
<p>with complex functions. If  .x/ is a complex function of a real variable x, then it
</p>
<p>can be written as
</p>
<p> .x/ D u.x/C iv.x/ (2.1a)
D j .x/j ei�.x/; (2.1b)
</p>
<p>where the real functions,
</p>
<p>u.x/ D Re Œ .x/&#141; I (2.2a)
v.x/ D Im Œ .x/&#141; ; (2.2b)
</p>
<p>are related to the magnitude j .x/j and argument �.x/ of  .x/ by
</p>
<p>j .x/j D

<p>I assume that you are familiar with complex functions of a real variable, but include
</p>
<p>some review problems at the end of the chapter.
</p>
<p>2.2 Functions and Taylor Series
</p>
<p>In physics, we are always making approximations. Most potentials can be approx-
</p>
<p>imated as quadratic in a region near a potential minimum. Often we want to know
</p>
<p>the value of a function in the region of a particular point. To be able to get this
</p>
<p>information, we must know the value of the function at the point and the values of
</p>
<p>the derivatives of the function at the point. The more derivatives we know, the better
</p>
<p>we can approximate the function.
</p>
<p>2.2.1 Functions of One Variable
</p>
<p>This is the simplest case and the one with which you are most familiar. Consider the
</p>
<p>function shown in Fig. 2.1.
</p>
<p>Suppose we know the value f .x0/ at x0 D b and want to approximate the function
at x0 D x, when x � b. If the function were a straight line between the two points,
then a knowledge of the slope of the line would be sufficient to calculate f .x/. One
</p>
<p>can get a better and better approximation to f .x/ by approximating the function
</p>
<p>between the points as a polynomial&mdash;the higher the order of the polynomial, the
</p>
<p>1The restriction of �.x/ to values ��=2 � �.x/ � �=2 corresponds to what is known as the
principal value of tan�1. In some problems, such as those to be encountered in scattering theory,
</p>
<p>�.x/ can correspond to a physical quantity that should not be restricted to these limits.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2 Functions and Taylor Series 35
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.1 Approximating a function f .x0/ near x0 D b
</p>
<p>better the approximation. In effect, each time we add a power to the polynomial fit,
</p>
<p>we need to know one higher derivative of the function in the vicinity of x0 D b. To
proceed formally one writes
</p>
<p>f .n�1/.x/ � f .n�1/.b/ D
Z x
</p>
<p>b
</p>
<p>f .n/.x00/ dx00; (2.6)
</p>
<p>where f .n/.x/ is the nth derivative of f .x/ and f .n/.b/ is a shorthand notation for
</p>
<p>f .n/.x/ evaluated at x D b. If you change the x to x0 in this equation and integrate
both sides with respect to x0 from b to x, you can obtain

<p>f .n/.b/. Equation (2.10) is known as Taylor&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>theorem and the sum on the right-hand side of the equation is a Taylor series of the
</p>
<p>function f .x/ about x D b. One can set b! y and x! yC a in Eq. (2.10) to write

<p>for jx � bj &lt; rc.b/ and Eq. (2.11) only for jaj &lt; rc.y/, where rc is the radius of
convergence.
</p>

</p>
<p>x in Eq. (2.10). If I keep only three terms in the series, I find

<p>of
p

</p>
<p>2.2.2 Scalar Functions of Three Variables
</p>
<p>Next I consider scalar functions of the form f .r/. What does this mean? In this
</p>
<p>expression, r D xuxCyuyCzuz is the coordinate vector (I use a notation in which uj
is a unit vector in the j direction). If one specifies .x; y; z/, then f .r/ � f .x; y; z/ gives
a prescription for evaluating the value of the function at that point. For example, the
</p>
<p>scalar potential associated with a point charge q located at position a D axux C
ayuy C azuz is
</p>
<p>V.r/ D V.x; y; z/ D q
4��0
</p>
<p>1q
.x � ax/2 C
</p>
<p>�
y � ay
</p>
<p>�2 C .z � az/2
: (2.13)
</p>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s theorem can be extended to functions of three variables, such as V.r/. To
</p>
<p>generalize the one variable result, I use a &ldquo;trick.&rdquo; The trick is to express the function
</p>
<p>at the new point in terms of a single dependent variable, as one does when writing
</p>
<p>a parametric equation for a line in terms of a single variable [e.g., x D at; y D bt2].
Thus I write
</p>
<p>f .rC a/ D f .xC ax; yC ay; zC az/ D f .xC ˛t; yC ˇt; zC &#13; t/; (2.14)
</p>

</p>
<p>It is easy to generate higher order terms. Note that the first derivative terms can
</p>
<p>be written as r f � a and can be used to define the gradient in arbitrary coordinate
systems.
</p>
<p>2.2.3 Vector Functions of Three Variables
</p>
<p>Quantities such as scalars, vectors, tensors are often defined in terms of their
</p>
<p>transformation properties under some symmetry operation. For example, a scalar
</p>
<p>function under rotation is one that is unchanged as the coordinate axes are rotated.
</p>
<p>A vector function such as the electric field E.r/ consists of three scalar functions
</p>
<p>ŒEx.r/;Ey.r/;Ez.r/] whose components change in a prescribed manner under a</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>38 2 Mathematical Preliminaries
</p>
<p>rotation of the coordinate axes. If you want to make a Taylor series expansion of
</p>
<p>a vector function, you must expand each of the component functions in a Taylor
</p>
<p>series. Thus,

</p>
<p>The vector form in the last line is useful only in rectangular coordinates. Note that
</p>
<p>if you write E.r/ using spherical or cylindrical coordinates and make a Taylor&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>expansion, you must make a Taylor&rsquo;s expansion of both the components and the
</p>
<p>unit vectors, since the unit vectors depend on the coordinates.
</p>
<p>2.3 Vector Calculus
</p>
<p>Most of you are familiar with the divergence or Gauss theorem and Stokes theorem.

<p>2.4 Probability Distributions
</p>
<p>You are all familiar with elementary concepts of probability theory. If you throw
</p>
<p>one die, there is a probability of 1=6 that any number comes up. If you increase
</p>
<p>the number of sides of the die to 3 million, then the probability for any side to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40 2 Mathematical Preliminaries
</p>
<p>come up is 1=
�
3 � 106
</p>
<p>�
(welcome to the lottery). As the number of sides increases
</p>
<p>without limit, the probability for any specific event to occur goes to zero, even if
</p>
<p>we know one event must occur on each trial. In the limit of the number of sides
</p>
<p>going to infinity, the probability of individual events is replaced by what is called
</p>
<p>the probability density P.x/ for an event to occur.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the concept of a probability density, consider the probability that
</p>
<p>a point chosen at random on a line having length L is at the midpoint of the line.
</p>
<p>Of course, this probability is zero, as it is to obtain any single point in a single
</p>
<p>measurement. On the other hand, we can ask for the probability that a point chosen
</p>
<p>at random lies between x and xC dx. This probability is no longer equal to zero, but
is given by
</p>
<p>P.x/dx D dx=L; (2.26)
</p>
<p>since
</p>
<p>P.x/ D
�
1=L 0 � x � L
0 otherwise
</p>
<p>(2.27)
</p>

<p>The HWHM is equal to 0:8326� and the FWHM is equal to 1:665� .
</p>
<p>There can be some confusion as to the meaning of the &ldquo;width&rdquo; of a probability
</p>
<p>distribution. For a smooth distribution such as a Gaussian, one can define the
</p>
<p>&ldquo;width&rdquo; as either the HWHM or FWHM. For other distributions, the HWHM and
</p>
<p>FWHM may have no significance at all. On the other hand, the standard deviation
</p>
<p>of a probability distribution is always defined as the square root of the variance of
</p>
<p>the distribution. For some distributions, such as a Gaussian, the standard deviation
</p>
<p>and HWHM are not all that different, but for other distributions, they can differ
</p>
<p>dramatically. Some examples will help to illustrate this point.

<p>2.5 Fourier Transforms
</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, we often need to use Fourier transforms. The wave functions
</p>
<p>in coordinate space and momentum space are Fourier transforms of one another.
</p>
<p>This topic is covered in most textbooks on mathematical physics, so I will just
</p>
<p>sketch a few of the results. The functions f .x/ and a.k/ are Fourier transforms of
</p>
<p>one another if

<p>In essence, the Fourier transform of a spatial function is an expansion in functions
</p>
<p>having different wavelengths or propagation constants k, while the Fourier transform
</p>
<p>of a time-dependent function is an expansion in terms of its frequency components
</p>
<p>(including negative frequencies).
</p>
<p>There are many properties of Fourier transforms that are derived in standard
</p>
<p>textbooks. The most important property that we will encounter relates the variances
</p>
<p>&#129;x2 and &#129;k2. Let f .x/ and a.k/ be Fourier transforms of one another and define</p>

</p>
<p>I will prove Eq. (2.49) in Chap. 5. In essence, jf .x/j2 can be considered to be a
probability distribution in coordinate space and ja.k/j2 a probability distribution in
k-space. The quantities Nx and Nk are the average values or mean of the functions
jf .x/j2 and ja.k/j2, respectively, and &#129;x2 and &#129;k2 are the variances in coordinate
and k-space, respectively, while

<p>2.6 Dirac Delta Function
</p>
<p>The Dirac delta function appears in many branches of physics. It is not difficult to
</p>
<p>understand why this is the case. For example, what is the density of a point charge
</p>
<p>having total charge q? Clearly, the charge density �.r/ equals zero everywhere but
</p>
<p>at the location of the charge. Since the volume of a point equals zero, the density at
</p>
<p>the position of the charge must be infinite. This leads us to define a function in three
</p>
<p>dimensions, ı.r/, such that for a point charge,
</p>
<p>�.r/ D qı.r/; (2.61)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>ı.r/ D 0 if r &curren; 0I (2.62a)
ı.r/ D 1 if r D 0I (2.62b)
</p>
<p>Z
ı.r/dr D 1 if the origin is inside the integration volume; (2.62c)
</p>
<p>Z
ı.r/dr D 0 if the origin is outside the integration volume. (2.62d)
</p>
<p>With this definition
</p>
<p>Z
�.r/dr D q (2.63)
</p>
<p>as required, provided the charge is in the integration volume. Note that ı.r/ has units
</p>
<p>of inverse volume.
</p>
<p>The Dirac delta function is usually defined by its integral properties. That is, for
</p>
<p>any analytic function f .r/; it is defined by
</p>
<p>Z
f .r/ı.r/dr D f .0/: (2.64)
</p>
<p>In other words, the Dirac delta function picks out the value of the function at the
</p>
<p>point where the argument of the delta function is equal to zero. The definitions
</p>
<p>given in Eqs. (2.62) and (2.64) are consistent.
</p>
<p>I will first consider the one-dimensional Dirac delta function and then briefly
</p>
<p>discuss the Dirac delta function in two and three dimensions. The Dirac delta
</p>
<p>function in one dimension can be defined by
</p>
<p>ı.x/ D 0 if x &curren; 0I (2.65a)
ı.x/ D 1 if x D 0I (2.65b)</p>

</p>
<p>The Dirac delta function ı.x/ is an infinitely narrow function of x centered at
</p>
<p>x D 0. The area under the function is equal to unity. Perhaps the easiest way to
envision the Dirac delta function is the limit of a Gaussian having unit area whose

that the Dirac delta function can be defined as the Fourier transform of a constant.

</p>
<p>Free-Particle Schr&ouml;dinger Equation: Wave
Packets
</p>
<p>The Schr&ouml;dinger equation is the fundamental equation of non-relativistic quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics. As with any equation in physics, its validity relies on experimental
</p>
<p>verification of the predictions of the equation. So far, it appears that there are no
</p>
<p>experiments that are inconsistent with quantum mechanics. As you shall see, it is
</p>
<p>not always easy to test the predictions of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation. In other words,
</p>
<p>mapping out the probability distribution associated with a quantum system can
</p>
<p>represent a formidable task. Moreover, quantum mechanics is far from a complete
</p>
<p>theory since it does not address the dynamic evolution of the wave function when
</p>
<p>a measurement is made. Nevertheless, the success of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation
</p>
<p>in describing the wave nature of matter and the energy level structure of atoms,
</p>
<p>molecules, and solids is beyond question.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, I discuss the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for a free particle, a particle not
</p>
<p>subjected to forces. Even though I use the word &ldquo;particle&rdquo; throughout this book, it
</p>
<p>is a misnomer in many cases since the particle is actually acting as a wave. It is not
</p>
<p>possible to derive Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation; it is essentially a postulate of quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics. However, it is possible to use an analogy with the wave equation of
</p>
<p>electromagnetism, plus some additional ingredients, to cook up an equation that
</p>
<p>turns out to be the time-dependent Schr&ouml;dinger equation for a free particle. This is
</p>
<p>the recipe I shall follow.
</p>
<p>I want to remind you of an admonition given in Chap. 1. The following chapters
</p>
<p>contain many mathematical expressions. Rather than focus on the mathematical
</p>
<p>details, you should always try to have a general idea of where the calculations
</p>
<p>are going. In other words, what physical features of a specific problem are being
</p>
<p>analyzed? Try not to let the mathematics obscure the underlying physical processes
</p>
<p>under investigation.

<p>54 3 Free-Particle Schr&ouml;dinger Equation: Wave Packets
</p>
<p>3.1 Electromagnetic Wave Equation: Pulses
</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s equations imply that both the electric and magnetic fields obey wave
</p>
<p>equations. The wave equation for the electric field vector E.R; t/ of light in
</p>
<p>vacuum is
</p>

</p>
<p>@z2
(3.2)
</p>
<p>is defined here in terms of its rectangular components and c is the speed of light.
</p>
<p>A solution of this equation that also satisfies Maxwell&rsquo;s equations for the electric
</p>
<p>field is
</p>
<p>E.r; t/ D O�Eei.k�r�!t/ C c.c:; (3.3)
</p>
<p>provided
</p>
<p>! D kc (3.4)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>k � O� D 0; (3.5)
</p>
<p>where O� is a unit polarization vector for the field. Equation (3.5) must be satisfied
</p>
<p>to insure that r �E.r; t/ D 0. There are two independent polarizations for each
field frequency and the direction of polarization is perpendicular to the propagation
</p>
<p>vector k of the field (the field is transverse). The abbreviation c.c. in Eq. (3.3) stands
</p>
<p>for complex conjugate.
</p>
<p>The field in Eq. (3.3) corresponds to an infinite, monochromatic, plane wave and
</p>
<p>is a basic building block solution of Maxwell&rsquo;s wave equation. It is possible to
</p>
<p>construct any field pulse using a superposition of such states. To simplify matters,
</p>
<p>I consider only one polarization component of the field and a plane wave field. For
</p>
<p>an arbitrary plane wave field propagating in the positive x direction and polarized in
</p>
<p>the z direction, the electric field can be written as
</p>
<p>E.r; t/ D uzE.x; t/; (3.6)
</p>
<p>where uz is a unit vector in the z direction and the amplitude E.x; t/ can be

<p>The integral over k has been restricted to positive values to ensure that each

</p>
<p>to show that Eq. (3.6) with E.x; t/ given by Eq. (3.7) is also a solution of the wave

<p>3.2 Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s Equation
</p>
<p>I want to use Einstein&rsquo;s concept of photons and de Broglie&rsquo;s concept of matter waves
</p>
<p>to make a plausible transition from the wave equation of electromagnetism to the
</p>
<p>Schr&ouml;dinger equation of quantum mechanics. I start by using Einstein&rsquo;s expression
</p>
<p>for the energy E (not to be confused with the field amplitude) associated with
</p>
<p>&ldquo;photons&rdquo; having frequency f D !=2� ,
</p>

<p>Although the electric field amplitude E.x; t/ is real, it is assumed that the wave

</p>
<p>Equation (3.16) is recognized as the time-dependent Schr&ouml;dinger equation for a free

<p>particle. Of course, some physical interpretation must be given to  .r; t/. As an
</p>
<p>additional postulate, I assume that j .r; t/j2 is the probability density to find the
particle at position r at time t.
</p>
<p>Equation (3.14) differs from Eq. (3.7) in a fundamental way since the dispersion

</p>
<p>As a result, waves having different values of k or p propagate at different velocities.
</p>
<p>Since the matter wave pulse, referred to as a wave packet, has components that
</p>
<p>propagate with different velocities and since no forces act on the particle, the shape
</p>
<p>of the wave packet changes in time, unlike that for a plane wave optical field pulse
</p>
<p>in vacuum.
</p>
<p>3.2.1 Wave Packets
</p>
<p>Now that I have defined the wave function, I can try to construct something that
</p>
<p>looks like a &ldquo;particle.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;particle&rdquo; can be somewhat confusing. First of all,
</p>
<p>I am considering a wave theory, so I have to define what I mean by a &ldquo;particle.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Moreover, particles in classical physics necessarily have some internal structure and
</p>
<p>finite spatial extent. For the most part, the particles to which I refer in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics correspond to idealized point particles in classical physics.
</p>
<p>Let me start from the wave function in three dimensions for a matter wave
</p>
<p>corresponding to a point particle having mass m, that is, a generalization of
</p>
<p>Eq. (3.14) to three dimensions. It is not difficult to show that the wave function

<p>vector k (since k D p=&bdquo;) must be fairly well defined. In other words, I must choose
jˆ.k/j2 to be non-vanishing only for those values of k satisfying jk � k0j . k0,
where k0 D Nk and &#129;k is the standard deviation of k for the distribution jˆ.k/j2.
Moreover, if jˆ.k/j2 is meant to represent a particle, it should be a smooth function
having a maximum at k D k0 that falls monotonically to zero in all directions (in
k space) for jk � k0j &gt; &#129;k. In other words, jˆ.k/j2 is a sharply peaked function
centered at k D k0 having width of order&#129;k. I need to approximate the exponential
function appearing in Eq. (3.18) when k � k0.
</p>
<p>It helps to write

k2 D Œk0 C .k � k0/&#141;2 D �k20 C 2k0 � kC jk � k0j2 ; (3.19)

<p>Although I have chosen a Gaussian wave packet, Eq. (3.40) turns out to be exact for
</p>
<p>any square-integrable initial wave function of the form  .x; 0/ D f .x/eik0x, for real
f .x/ (see Problem 5.14&ndash;15 in Chap. 5). The variance of the wave packet is its initial
</p>
<p>variance plus a contribution attributable to the variance of the velocity components
</p>
<p>contained in the packet. For sufficiently large times, &#129;x.t/ � &#129;vt.
I am now in a position to see when the wave packet can correspond to a classical
</p>
<p>particle. Free particles have never heard about wave packets; wave packets are a
</p>
<p>construct of physicists. For the wave packet to correspond to a particle, however,the
</p>
<p>uncertainties in position and momentum must satisfy
</p>
<p>&#129;x.t/� x0; &#129;p� p0 (3.41)
</p>
<p>subject to the restriction
</p>
<p>&#129;x.0/&#129;p � &bdquo;
2
: (3.42)
</p>
<p>The quantities x0 and p0 are determined by the problem. You can think of
</p>
<p>them as the smallest possible resolution in position and momentum that can be
</p>
<p>detected in a given experiment. In bound state problems they could correspond</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.2 Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s Equation 61
</p>
<p>to some typical bound state radius and magnitude of bound state momentum for
</p>
<p>the bound particle. For the free particle, let&rsquo;s take x0 D 10�8 m and v0 D 10�7
m/s, which locates the particle to better than an optical wavelength and fixes its
</p>
<p>velocity to about three meters per year. We might be able to accomplish this by
</p>
<p>using spatial filters (e.g., slits) to select both the position and range of velocities.
</p>
<p>For a one gram mass, suppose we take &#129;x.0/ D 10�11 m which implies that
&#129;v D &#129;p=m � &bdquo;=Œm&#129;x.0/&#141; � 10�20 m/s [admittedly, it would be difficult to
create such a small wave packet]. This is a &ldquo;classical&rdquo; particle at t D 0 according to
my definition since it obeys conditions (3.41). At what time t would the spreading
</p>
<p>be sufficient to render the particle &ldquo;unclassical&rdquo; ? Arbitrarily, let&rsquo;s say the particle is
</p>
<p>no longer classical if &#129;x.t/ D x0=100 D 10�10 m, which occurs for t D 1010 s, 300
years! The bottom line is that spreading is unimportant as long as the de Broglie
</p>
<p>wavelength is much smaller than any characteristic length in the problem, such
</p>
<p>as the width of the initial wave packet. On the other hand, if you confine a free
</p>
<p>particle wave packet to a distance equal to its de Broglie wavelength, the spread in
</p>
<p>momentum in the wave packet is of order of the average momentum in the packet;
</p>
<p>as such spreading is important and the particle can no longer be viewed as a classical
</p>
<p>particle.
</p>
<p>A simple example that illustrates the necessity of using a quantum description
</p>
<p>of matter can be found in an experiment related to atom optics. Suppose a well-
</p>
<p>collimated, pulsed atomic beam having velocity v0 in the z direction is incident on a
</p>
<p>circular aperture having diameter d that is located in the xy plane. Moreover, assume
</p>
<p>that the de Broglie wavelength of the atoms, �dB � d. The atoms are treated as point
particles, so another implicit assumption is that the atomic size is much smaller
</p>
<p>than d as well. After traversing the aperture at t D 0, you can think of the initial
wave packet as a short pulse in the z direction having a cross-sectional area equal
</p>
<p>to �d2=4. The transverse uncertainty in the momentum of this beam is of order
</p>
<p>&#129;p? � &bdquo;=d. Matter wave effects become important when the transverse spreading
is of order d; that is, for times t greater than some critical time tF defined by
</p>
<p>&#129;p?tF=m � &bdquo;tF=.dm/ � d; (3.43)
</p>
<p>where m is the mass of an atom in the beam. Since t � z=v0 where z is the distance
from the screen containing the aperture, the distance zF corresponding to the time
</p>
<p>tF is
</p>
<p>zF D v0tF �
mv0d
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>&bdquo; �
d2
</p>
<p>�dB
: (3.44)
</p>
<p>For z � zF, the scattering of the particles by the slit is in the shadow region and
the atomic motion can be treated classically. However for z &amp; zF, diffraction plays
</p>
<p>an important role and a wave theory is needed. The situation is analogous to the
</p>
<p>scattering of optical radiation having wavelength � by an aperture having diameter
</p>
<p>d. For distances z � zF D d2=� from the diffracting screen, a geometrical picture
of light rays can be used, but once z &amp; zF, diffraction effects become important
</p>
<p>and a wave theory of light is needed. In the optical case the region with z � zF
corresponds to Fresnel diffraction.</p>

<p>62 3 Free-Particle Schr&ouml;dinger Equation: Wave Packets
</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to create a well-defined wave packet is to trap and cool an
</p>
<p>atom in the potential well of an optical lattice. An optical lattice is formed by using
</p>
<p>pairs of counter-propagating laser beams. These pairs of fields form standing wave
</p>
<p>patterns that can be used to trap neutral atoms owing to a spatially varying potential
</p>
<p>that is experienced by the atoms in the fields. Moreover the atoms can be cooled to
</p>
<p>the point where they are in the ground state of the potential. As such, if you trap one
</p>
<p>atom in one well, you have a pretty good idea of its wave function. If you suddenly
</p>
<p>remove the potential by turning off the fields, you have an initial condition in which
</p>
<p>the atom is in its ground state and has a center-of-mass wave function given by the
</p>
<p>ground state of the potential. You could let this wave packet propagate for some
</p>
<p>time and then restore the lattice and determine how far the packet has moved by
</p>
<p>seeing which well it is in. Although this experiment has yet to be carried out, the
</p>
<p>technology is now at the point where it is feasible.

<p>3.4 Problems 65
</p>
<p>3.3 Summary
</p>
<p>I have shown that it is possible to obtain Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation for a free particle,
</p>
<p>using an analogy with optical pulse propagation, along with de Broglie&rsquo;s definition
</p>
<p>of the wavelength of matter and Einstein&rsquo;s definition of the energy of a photon.
</p>
<p>The resultant free particle wave packet differs in a fundamental way from that of
</p>
<p>an optical pulse, since the dispersion relation relating energy to the momentum
</p>
<p>is quadratic for matter and linear for light. As a consequence, optical pulses in
</p>
<p>vacuum propagate without changing their shape, while free-particle, matter wave
</p>
<p>packets contain several momentum components and necessarily change their shape
</p>
<p>as a function of time.
</p>

;
</p>
<p>is not a bad guess for the width of the wave packet at any time. Using this guess
</p>
<p>with ˛ D 1, find the time it takes for a wave packet that is confined to its de Broglie
wavelength to spread to twice its initial width in terms of the particle&rsquo;s energy and
</p>
<p>Planck&rsquo;s constant.
</p>
<p>2. Using the result of Problem 3.1 and assuming that you are a point particle having
</p>
<p>mass 50 kg and are localized to 1:0 � 10�11 m, calculate how long it would take for
you to spread by an amount equal to this initial localization distance.
</p>
<p>3&ndash;4. Start with a one-dimensional wave packet in coordinate space. Take a wave
</p>
<p>function such as  .x/ D Ne�x4 or  .x/ D Ne�x6 , for which no simple analytic
solution exists for its Fourier transform. Normalize your wave function using
</p>
<p>numerical integration to find the value of N. Plot j .x/j2. Using Mathematica,
Matlab, or Maple (or any other program you have), use numerical integration
</p>
<p>[NIntegrate in Mathematica] to obtain and plot the k-space distribution associated
</p>
<p>with the wave packet you chose. How does it differ from a Gaussian? Why?
</p>
<p>Calculate the value of &#129;x&#129;k using numerical integration. In this problem, both x
</p>
<p>and k are dimensionless variables.
</p>
<p>5. Sodium atoms moving at 1000 m/s are incident on a slit having a width of
</p>
<p>100 nm. At 3 m from the slit, what is the approximate transverse width associated
</p>
<p>with the sodium atom&rsquo;s wave function? Is diffraction important in this case? These
</p>
<p>are typical values for experiments in atom optics.</p>

<p>Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s Equation with Potential Energy:
Introduction to Operators
</p>
<p>The wave equations of electromagnetism are a natural consequence of Maxwell&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>equations. The time and spatial derivatives of the fields are found to be connected
</p>
<p>in a simple manner. But what physical interpretation can be given to the quantity
</p>
<p>r2 .r; t/ that appears in Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation? To understand the physical
significance of this term, I have to introduce the concept of operators. Operators
</p>
<p>play a very important role in quantum mechanics but can be a bit confusing;
</p>
<p>specifically a distinction must be made between operators and functions. The plan is
</p>
<p>to look at the free particle Schr&ouml;dinger equation and to show that the �
�
&bdquo;2=2m
</p>
<p>�
r2
</p>
<p>term can be represented as Op2=2m D Op � Op=2m, where Op is an operator. I will then
be able to generalize Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation to account for situations in which
</p>
<p>an external potential is present. To simplify matters, I work with the Schr&ouml;dinger
</p>
<p>equation in one dimension; in the Appendix, an analogous development is given for
</p>
<p>the Schr&ouml;dinger equation in three dimensions.
</p>
<p>4.1 Hamiltonian Operator
</p>
<p>So far I have been talking about free-particle solutions of Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation,
</p>
<p>which, in one dimension, is written as
</p>
<p>i&bdquo;@ .x; t/
@t
</p>
<p>D � &bdquo;
2
</p>
<p>2m
</p>
<p>@2 .x; t/
</p>
<p>@x2
: (4.1)
</p>
<p>The quantity @2=@x2 appearing in this equation is an operator that acts on functions
</p>
<p>in coordinate space. The operation simply involves second order differentiation of
</p>
<p>the function. Operators do just that, they operate on a function to produce a new
</p>
<p>function. For example, you could define the &ldquo;Chicago operator&rdquo; that translates the
</p>
<p>wave function to the top of the Sear&rsquo;s tower in Chicago.

<p>I now integrate by parts two times and assume that the wave function and its

<p>for any function g.p/. In other words, the operator Op2 acting on a function g.p/ in
momentum space simply multiplies g.p/ by p2.
</p>
<p>This is an important result. In coordinate space, the free particle Schr&ouml;dinger

<p>In the momentum representation, however, things are not so clear, since I do not

<p>use my assumption that  .r; t/ and ˆ.p; t/ are Fourier transforms of one another

<p>Equation (4.22) is a critically important result. If we can solve the time-

<p>the time-independent Schr&ouml;dinger equation. However you should not forget that
</p>
<p>the interesting dynamics of a quantum system is obtained only through a solution

<p>of the time-dependent Schr&ouml;dinger equation. In order to solve equations of the type

<p>given in Eq. (4.21), I will need the additional ammunition to be provided in Chap. 5.

<p>4.3 Summary
</p>
<p>The concept of an operator in quantum mechanics has been introduced. I found
</p>
<p>that the square of the momentum operator is proportional to the Laplacian oper-
</p>
<p>ator in coordinate space. We have seen that it is possible to obtain a solution
</p>
<p>of the time-dependent Schr&ouml;dinger equation if we are able to solve the time-
</p>
<p>independent Schr&ouml;dinger equation. The formal method for solving the time-
</p>
<p>independent Schr&ouml;dinger is given in the next chapter, where I discuss the properties
</p>
<p>of operators in a more systematic fashion.

<p>Postulates and Basic Elements of Quantum
Mechanics: Properties of Operators
</p>
<p>In this chapter I present a somewhat more formal introduction to the theory that
</p>
<p>underlies quantum mechanics. Although the discussion is limited mainly to single
</p>
<p>particles, many of the results apply equally well to many-particle systems. Some
</p>
<p>of the postulates of the theory depend on the properties of Hermitian operators,
</p>
<p>operators that play a central role in quantum mechanics. First I state the postulates,
</p>
<p>then discuss Hermitian operators, and finally explore some results that follow
</p>
<p>directly from Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation.
</p>
<p>The postulates are:
</p>
<p>1. The absolute square of the wave function j .r; t/j2 that characterizes a particle
corresponds to the probability density of finding the particle at position r at
</p>
<p>time t.
</p>
<p>2. To each dynamic physical observable in classical mechanics (such as posi-
</p>
<p>tion, momentum, energy), there corresponds a Hermitian operator in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics.
</p>
<p>3. The time dependence of  .r; t/ is governed by the time-dependent Schr&ouml;dinger
</p>
<p>equation,
</p>
<p>i&bdquo;@ .r; t/
@t
</p>
<p>D OH .r; t/ (5.1)
</p>
<p>where OH is the energy operator of the system.
4. The only possible outcome of a measurement on a single quantum system of
</p>
<p>a physical observable associated with a given Hermitian operator is one of the
</p>
<p>eigenvalues of the operator.
</p>
<p>5. I must add one additional postulate. This postulate can take different forms.
</p>
<p>The one I use at this juncture is that the wave functions in coordinate space,
</p>
<p> .r; t/, and in momentum space, ˆ.p; t/, are Fourier transforms of one another,
</p>
<p>namely

<p>The function jˆ.p; t/j2 is the probability density in momentum space for the
particle to have momentum p at time t.
</p>
<p>You cannot measure j .r; t/j2 or jˆ.p; t/j2 directly. The only way you can
build up information on the wave function is to make a series of measurements on
</p>
<p>identically prepared quantum systems, since each measurement generally modifies
</p>
<p>the system in some way. Quantum mechanics does not contain a prescription for
</p>
<p>carrying out the measurements. In fact, in the model I have adopted, the measuring
</p>
<p>apparatus is external to the quantum system. Moreover, it is often not trivial to
</p>
<p>construct experiments that directly measure physical observables such as energy,
</p>
<p>angular momentum, position, and momentum.
</p>
<p>For the moment I associate quantum-mechanical operators with the coordinate,
</p>
<p>momentum, kinetic energy and potential energy functions of classical mechanics.
</p>
<p>For the coordinate and potential energy operators, Or and OV , corresponding to the
classical variables r and V.r/; I define their operations in coordinate space by
</p>
<p>Orf .r/ D rf .r/ (5.4a)
OVf .r/ D V.r/f .r/ (5.4b)
</p>
<p>for any function f .r/. Similarly for the momentum and kinetic energy operators,
</p>
<p>Op and Op2=2m; corresponding to the classical variables p and p2=2m; I define their
operations in momentum space by
</p>
<p>Opg.p/ D pg.p/ (5.5a)
Op2
2m
</p>
<p>g.p/ D p
2
</p>
<p>2m
g.p/ (5.5b)
</p>
<p>for any function g.p/. It will turn out that postulate 5 will allow me to determine how
</p>
<p>Or and OV act on functions of momentum, as well as how Op and Op2 act on functions
of position. We have already seen in Chap. 4 that Op2f .r/ D �&bdquo;2r2f .r/, but this
relationship will be rederived using the postulates.

</p>
<p>corresponding eigenfunction. It turns out that there are always solutions of equations
</p>
<p>of this type, provided the operators are Hermitian. To define what I mean by a
</p>
<p>Hermitian operator, I need to introduce the concept of the expectation value of an
</p>
<p>operator.
</p>
<p>The expectation value of an operator OA for a quantum system described by wave
functions in coordinate and momentum space,  .r; t/ or ˆ.p; t/, respectively, is

<p>defined as

</p>
<p>The symbols dr and dp correspond to volume elements in coordinate and momen-
</p>
<p>tum space, respectively, and the integrals in Eq. (5.7) are over all coordinate or
</p>
<p>momentum space. The expectation value is independent of whether the coordinate
</p>
<p>or momentum representation for the wave function is used. The operator OA is
assumed to be time-independent, but
</p>
<p>D
OA
E
</p>
<p>is a function of t, in general, owing to
</p>
<p>the time-dependence of the wave function. In writing Eq. (5.7), I assumed that the
</p>
<p>wave functions were normalized probability distributions; that is

</p>
<p>Equation (5.12) can be used as the definition of a Hermitian operator. I will assume
</p>
<p>that all the operators we encounter in quantum mechanics are Hermitian operators.
</p>
<p>This is not unreasonable, since the expectation value of any physical dynamic
</p>
<p>variable must be real.
</p>
<p>It turns out that the properties of Hermitian operators have been well-established
</p>
<p>by mathematicians. One of the most important properties is that there exists a
</p>
<p>complete set of eigenfunctions  a.r/ associated with a time-independent Hermitian
</p>
<p>operator OA for which
</p>
<p>OA a.r/ D a a.r/ (5.13)
</p>
<p>where a is the eigenvalue associated with the eigenfunction  a.r/. The proof of
</p>
<p>existence and completeness is not trivial and is not given here. For the problems we
</p>
<p>encounter in quantum mechanics, there are certain boundary conditions that apply.
</p>
<p>The Hermitian nature of the operators and the completeness of the eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>depend implicitly on the appropriate boundary conditions. Examples are given as
</p>
<p>we go along.
</p>
<p>At this point you might be getting frustrated and confused. What relationship do
</p>
<p>the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues have to physical systems? If we solve for these
</p>
<p>quantities, what have we gained? It turns out that the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues
</p>
<p>give us a complete picture of what is going on in quantum mechanics. The reason
</p>
<p>for this is that we can associate a Hermitian operator with every dynamic physical
</p>
<p>observable that can be measured. The outcome of a physical measurement of the
</p>
<p>operator associated with a single quantum system must be one and only one of
</p>
<p>the eigenvalues associated with that operator. Thus, if we measure the energy of a
</p>
<p>particle, we get one possible eigenvalue of the energy operator for that particle. If we
</p>
<p>measure the angular momentum of a particle, we get one eigenvalue of the angular
</p>
<p>momentum operator. Moreover, if we find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of
</p>
<p>the energy operator, we completely determine the wave function for the quantum
</p>
<p>system, given the initial conditions. The wave function allows you to calculate all
</p>
<p>properties of the quantum system. Many of these ideas will become clear with the
</p>
<p>examples that are given after I establish some properties of Hermitian operators.

<p>5.1.2 Orthogonality
</p>
<p>You are familiar with the concept of two vectors being orthogonal. The concept

</p>
<p>Equation (5.45) is a condition that must be satisfied if the eigenfunctions are
</p>
<p>complete.
</p>
<p>Equation (5.42) is analogous to the expansion of a vector in terms of unit
</p>
<p>vectors, except that the unit vectors are now replaced by orthonormal functions.
</p>
<p>The dot product of vectors is replaced by an integral of the form given in Eq. (5.16).
</p>
<p>Moreover, Eq. (5.43) is equivalent to projecting out the component of a vector. The
</p>
<p>analogue with vector spaces will become exact when I consider Dirac notation in
</p>
<p>Chap. 11.
</p>
<p>5.1.4 Continuous Eigenvalues
</p>
<p>So far it has been assumed implicitly that the eigenvalues are discrete. As you
</p>
<p>shall see, this is always the case if the particles are confined to a finite volume.
</p>
<p>However unbound particles have continuous eigenvalues. For example, consider a
</p>
<p>free particle having mass m. The time-independent Schr&ouml;dinger equation for this
</p>
<p>particle is
</p>
<p>OH E.r/ D
Op2
2m
 E.r/ D �
</p>
<p>&bdquo;2
2m
r2 E.r/: (5.46)
</p>
<p>Clearly the momentum of a free particle can take on any value. Moreover, for a given
</p>
<p>positive energy, there is an infinite number of momenta corresponding to a given
</p>
<p>energy&mdash;there is infinite degeneracy. To label each of the degenerate eigenfunctions,
</p>
<p>I can use the momentum and take as eigenfunctions
</p>
<p> p.r/ D eip�r=&bdquo;; (5.47)
</p>
<p>which are solutions of Eq. (5.46), provided
</p>
<p>E D p

</p>
<p>2m

</p>
<p>The question arises as to how to normalize these eigenfunctions. ClearlyR

<p>case of unbound motion in the presence of a potential; however, the eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>are no longer given by Eqs. (5.50) and (5.51).
</p>
<p>In going from discrete to continuous eigenvalues, the units for the wave functions
</p>
<p>and the expansion coefficients change. For discrete eigenenergies, the eigenfunc-
</p>
<p>tions in coordinate space have units of 1=

<p>volume. For continuous eigenvalues,
</p>
<p> p.r/ has units of .&bdquo;/�3=2 while  k.r/ is dimensionless. Similar differences arise

</p>
<p>In contrast to the case of discrete eigenenergies for which the expansion coefficients

<p>of the wave function are dimensionless, the expansion coefficients b.p/ have units of

<p>I have already derived an expression for the square of the momentum operator in

<p>Equations (5.72)&ndash;(5.75) are the fundamental commutator relations. Remember them
</p>
<p>at all times!
</p>
<p>Commuting operators play a central role in quantum mechanics. I first prove
</p>
<p>that two Hermitian operators commute if and only if they possess simultaneous
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions. There are two parts to the proof. First suppose that Hermitian
</p>
<p>operators OA and OB possess simultaneous eigenfunctions  ab,
</p>
<p>OA ab D a ab; OB ab D b ab . (5.76)
</p>
<p>Then

<p>h

<p>i
 ab D
</p>
<p>�
OA OB � OB OA
</p>
<p>�
 ab D .ba � ab/  ab D 0 (5.77)
</p>
<p>and the operators commute. Conversely, suppose that  a is an eigenfunction of OA
and that
</p>
<p>h
OA; OB
</p>
<p>i
 a D 0: Then
</p>
<p>h

D a

<p>Equation (5.78) is nothing but a statement of the fact that

OB a

is an eigenfunction
</p>
<p>of OA with eigenvalue a, having the most general form
</p>
<p>OB a D b a; (5.79)
</p>
<p>where b is some constant. Therefore,  a is a simultaneous eigenfunction of OB
with eigenvalue b. Actually the proof is valid only if the eigenfunctions  a are
</p>
<p>nondegenerate. If there are N degenerate eigenfunctions  .m/a associated with
</p>
<p>eigenvalue a, Eq. (5.78) implies only that</p>

</p>
<p>However, as in the Schmidt orthogonalization procedure, it is always possible to
</p>
<p>find linear combinations of the degenerate eigenfunctions that are simultaneous
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of OB.
Thus if two Hermitian operators commute and one of these operators has
</p>
<p>nondegenerate eigenvalues, then its eigenfunctions are automatically eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>of the other operator. On the other hand, if two Hermitian operators commute and
</p>
<p>one of these operators has degenerate eigenvalues, then a degenerate eigenfunction
</p>
<p>of one of the operators is not automatically an eigenfunction of the other operator,
</p>
<p>but some linear combinations of the degenerate eigenfunctions can be chosen that is
</p>
<p>an eigenfunction of the other operator. Examples are given later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>The central problem in quantum mechanics is to solve the time-independent
</p>
<p>Schr&ouml;dinger equation. As long as there is no energy degeneracy, for discrete energy
</p>
<p>eigenvalues, you can always label the energy by a quantum number n with the
</p>
<p>lowest value of n corresponding to the lowest energy, the second value to the next
</p>
<p>highest energy, etc. For example, if V.x/ D ax4 C bx2 C cx with a &gt; 0, it is not
possible to find analytic expressions for the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions, but
</p>
<p>you can still label the lowest energy state and eigenfunction by n D 0, the next by
n D 1, etc. When there is energy degeneracy, however, we need additional labels
to distinguish states having the same energy; that is we need additional quantum
</p>
<p>numbers. Where can we get these quantum numbers? There may be a number of
</p>
<p>ways to specify the quantum numbers, but the most systematic way is to identify
</p>
<p>additional operators that commute with the Hamiltonian. You can then label the
</p>
<p>states by the eigenvalues of the simultaneous eigenfunctions of the commuting
</p>
<p>operators. It turns out, whenever there is energy degeneracy, it is usually possible
</p>
<p>to identify an operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian that is in some way
</p>
<p>associated with the degeneracy.
</p>
<p>We have already seen one example of energy degeneracy and will see many more
</p>
<p>throughout this book. For the free particle in one dimension, the eigenfunctions are
</p>
<p>two-fold degenerate for each positive energy,  E.x/ D e˙i
p
2mEx=&bdquo;. That is, given
</p>
<p>the energy, you cannot uniquely label the eigenfunction. However the momentum
</p>
<p>and energy operators commute. Moreover, the momentum state eigenfunctions,
</p>
<p>given by eipxx=&bdquo;, are nondegenerate (each momentum eigenfunction is associated
with a different momentum). As a consequence the momentum state eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>must be simultaneous eigenfunctions of the energy operator. If we label the
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions by px alone, we completely specify the energy eigenfunctions as
</p>
<p>well. In other words, the eigenfunctions

<p>For commutators involving higher powers of r and p, such as r2 and p2, one usually

<p>uses a combination of Eqs. (5.83), (5.84), and (5.87), rather than calculate the effect

<p>5.1.7 Uncertainty Principle
</p>
<p>Many people have heard about Heisenberg&rsquo;s Uncertainty Relation, even if they do
</p>
<p>not understand it. Actually, it is possible to derive an uncertainty relation for the
</p>
<p>product &#129;A2&#129;B2 for any two non-commuting Hermitian operators OA and OB. To do
so I start from the inequality
</p>

</p>
<p>�
 .r/
</p>
<p>i� � OAC i� OB
�
 .r/ � 0; (5.89)
</p>
<p>where � is a constant taken to be real (a somewhat more general uncertainty relation
</p>
<p>can be derived if � is taken to be complex). Without loss of generality, I take
D
OA
E
D 0
</p>
<p>and
D

</p>
<p>D
OA
E
</p>
<p>and OB by OB�
D

E
</p>
<p>in Eq. (5.89). Since OA and OB are Hermitian, Eq. (5.89) can be rewritten as

</p>
<p>consequently &#129;x2&#129;p2x must be greater than &bdquo;2=4 for this wave function.
The uncertainty principle is often illustrated by examples in which you show
</p>
<p>that by measuring the position of a particle to a given precision, you necessarily
</p>
<p>introduce an uncertainty in the momentum that satisfies the uncertainty principle.
</p>
<p>You will note that my derivation has nothing to do with measurement, per se. In
</p>
<p>effect, the position-momentum uncertainty relation is related directly to the fact that
</p>
<p>the corresponding operators do not commute. Equivalently, it is linked to the fact
</p>
<p>that matter is described by a wave theory in which the wave functions in coordinate</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>96 5 Postulates and Basic Elements of Quantum Mechanics: Properties of Operators
</p>
<p>and momentum space are Fourier transforms of one another. Any measurements
</p>
<p>must be consistent with the theory, but the measurements themselves are not directly
</p>
<p>related to the uncertainty principle.
</p>
<p>5.1.8 Examples of Operators
</p>
<p>In most of the examples below, I consider one-dimensional motion only, with
</p>
<p>p standing for the x component of the momentum. Moreover, I work in the
</p>
<p>coordinate representation only. The generalization to two and three dimensions is
</p>
<p>often obvious. The Hamiltonian is assumed to be of the form
</p>
<p>OH D Op
2
</p>
<p>2m
C OV: (5.99)
</p>
<p>5.1.8.1 Position Operator Ox
</p>
<p>The position operator is not often discussed in textbooks. I have assumed that, in
</p>
<p>coordinate space,
</p>
<p>Ox .x0/ D x0 .x0/: (5.100)
</p>
<p>Clearly Ox is Hermitian since
Z
</p>
<p>dx �.x/ ŒOx .x/&#141; D
Z
</p>
<p>dx �.x/x .x/
</p>
<p>D
Z
</p>
<p>dx Œx .x/&#141;�  .x/ D
Z
</p>
<p>dx ŒOx .x/&#141;�  .x/ (5.101)
</p>
<p>for real x.
</p>
<p>The operator Ox does not commute with the momentum operator Op, nor with the
Hamiltonian operator OH. As a consequence, it is impossible to find simultaneous
eigenfunctions of Ox and Op and it is also impossible to find simultaneous eigenfunc-
tions of Ox and OH. But what are the eigenfunctions of Ox? The eigenvalue equation in
coordinate space is
</p>
<p>Ox a.x/ D a a.x/; (5.102)
</p>
<p>where the eigenvalue is designated by a to avoid confusion. From Eq. (5.100), we
</p>
<p>know that
</p>
<p>Ox a.x/ D x a.x/ (5.103)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.1 Hermitian Operators: Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions 97
</p>
<p>which, together with Eq. (5.102), implies that
</p>
<p>x a.x/ D a a.x/ (5.104)
</p>
<p>for all x. The only way this can be true is if
</p>
<p> a.x/ D ı .x � a/ : (5.105)
</p>
<p>This has the proper normalization for continuous eigenvalues,

<p>�
D ı
</p>

<p>�
: (5.106)
</p>
<p>Thus the eigenfunctions of the position operator are Dirac delta functions.
</p>
<p>5.1.8.2 Momentum Operator Op
</p>
<p>The momentum operator in coordinate space is
</p>
<p>Op D &bdquo;
i
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dx
: (5.107)
</p>
<p>This operator is Hermitian since

<p>Z 1

</p>
<p>where it is assumed that the boundary conditions are such that the endpoint term,
</p>
<p>j .x/j2
ˇ̌

</p>
<p>�1
, vanishes. This is true for any localized wave function. It would also be
</p>
<p>true for periodic boundary conditions in which  .L=2/ D  .�L=2/. This example
shows how the Hermiticity of an operator depends on boundary conditions.
</p>
<p>The momentum operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian, except in the
</p>
<p>case where V.x/ is a constant C, independent of x; which can be taken equal to zero
</p>
<p>without loss of generality (all energies in the problem are simply shifted by C). Thus,
</p>
<p>it is only for the free particle that it is possible to find simultaneous eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>of Op and OH, which are

<p>5.1.8.3 Parity Operator OP
</p>
<p>An important operator in quantum mechanics is the parity operator that simply
</p>
<p>inverts the signs of coordinates. In other words
</p>
<p>OP .x/ D  .�x/: (5.111)
</p>
<p>You can prove easily that OP is a Hermitian operator. Therefore, it has real
eigenvalues. To find these eigenvalues, I note that
</p>
<p>OP2 .x/ D OP .�x/ D  .x/; (5.112)
</p>
<p>implying that the eigenvalue of OP2 is one, which can be realized only if the (real)
eigenvalues of OP are˙1. That is, there are only two eigenvalues. For the eigenvalue
C1;
</p>
<p>OP C.x/ D  C.�x/ D  C.x/; (5.113)
</p>
<p>which implies that any even function is an eigenfunction of OP having eigenvalueC1.
Similarly,
</p>
<p>OP �.x/ D  �.�x/ D � �.x/I (5.114)
</p>
<p>any odd function is an eigenfunction of OP having eigenvalue �1: For example,
cos .ax/ has even parity and is an eigenfunction of OP having eigenvalueC1, sin .ax/
has odd parity and is an eigenfunction of OP having eigenvalue �1, while exp .iax/
does not have well-defined parity and is not an eigenfunction of the parity operator.
</p>
<p>The eigenfunctions of the parity operator are infinitely degenerate; any even function
</p>
<p>has eigenvalue C1 and any odd function has eigenvalue �1.
Since OP does not commute with Ox and does not commute with Op D &bdquo;

<p>i
D 0 if V.x/ is an even
</p>
<p>function of x. This is an important result, that will become even more important
</p>
<p>when generalized to problems in three dimensions. For any Hamiltonian that is
</p>
<p>invariant under an inversion of coordinates, the eigenfunctions can be written as
</p>
<p>simultaneous eigenfunctions of the energy and the parity operator. That is, the
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions can be written as either even or odd functions of the coordinates. In
</p>
<p>an introductory quantum mechanics course, students often forget this very important
</p>
<p>result, nor do they appreciate the importance of the parity operator.
</p>
<p>You might argue that the eigenfunctions for the free particle given in Eq. (5.109)
</p>
<p>are not eigenfunctions of the parity operator and you would be right. Those
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions are simultaneous eigenfunctions of the momentum and energy
</p>
<p>operators and cannot be simultaneous eigenfunctions of the parity operator since
</p>
<p>it is not possible to find simultaneous eigenfunctions of OP and Op. On the other hand,
we could have equally well taken our (unnormalized) energy eigenfunctions as
</p>
<p> p;E.x/ D
�
</p>
<p>cos .px=&bdquo;/
sin .px=&bdquo;/ , (5.115)
</p>
<p>which are simultaneous eigenfunctions of the parity operator, but no longer
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of the momentum operator. This is an example where there is a two-
</p>
<p>fold energy degeneracy; for each value of the energy (other than zero), there are
</p>
<p>two independent eigenfunctions. These eigenfunctions can be taken as simultaneous
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of the momentum operator or the parity operator, but not both (since
</p>
<p>the momentum and parity operators do not commute). With either choice, however,
</p>
<p>we have a unique way to label all the eigenfunctions. Recall that, if operators OA
and OB commute, and if the eigenfunctions of operator OA are degenerate, they are not
automatically eigenfunctions of operator OB, but that some linear combination of the
degenerate eigenfunctions of operator OA can be chosen to be an eigenfunction of
operator OB

<p>They are central to an understanding of quantum dynamics. In effect, there is a

<p>three-step program for solving any problem in quantum mechanics, given an initial

</p>
<p>The second step is to obtain the expansion coefficients, aE or a.k/ in terms of the

<p>The total probability is conserved for a single-particle quantum system. That is,

</p>
<p>where the fact that OH is Hermitian has been used. The expectation value of any
operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian is constant in time. Another way of
</p>
<p>saying this is that the dynamic variable associated with any Hermitian operator
</p>
<p>that commutes with the Hamiltonian is a constant of the motion. For the free
</p>
<p>particle, momentum is conserved, consistent with the fact that the momentum
</p>
<p>operator commutes with the Hamiltonian. In problems with spherically symmetric
</p>
<p>potentials, the angular momentum is conserved classically, implying that the angular
</p>
<p>momentum operator commutes with the Hamiltonian. If you know that a classical
</p>
<p>variable is a constant of the motion for a given potential, then the eigenvalues of
</p>
<p>the associated quantum operator can sometimes be used to distinguish between
</p>
<p>degenerate eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>Although Eq. (5.140) appears to provide a simple prescription for obtaining the
</p>
<p>expectation value of an operator, it is deceiving. In calculating the commutatorh
OA; OH
</p>
<p>i
; one normally introduces new operators. As such one is often led to a never-
</p>
<p>ending set of coupled equations for the expectation values of different operators. It is
</p>
<p>only for potentials such as those for the free particle and simple harmonic oscillator
</p>
<p>that Eq. (5.140) can be used to obtain a closed set of equations for the expectation
</p>
<p>values of the position and momentum operators.</p>

<p>5.2 Back to the Schr&ouml;dinger Equation 105
</p>
<p>An alternative method for obtaining
D
OA
E
</p>
<p>is to calculate the expectation value of
</p>
<p>any operator directly from the wave function. For example, if
</p>
<p> .r; t/ D
X
</p>
<p>E

</p>
<p>In general there is time dependence in

</p>
<p>resulting from the exponential factors.
</p>
<p>For operators that commute with OH the time dependence must disappear since

</p>
<p>is constant in this limit.

<p>Since OH commutes with itself, the average energy is time-independent. Explicitly,

<p>OH D OH1 C OH2: (5.146)
</p>
<p>Since the Hamiltonians correspond to independent quantum systems, they must
</p>
<p>satisfy
h
OH1; OH2
</p>
<p>i
D 0; consequently, the operators can possess simultaneous
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions. I can guess a solution in which the eigenfunctions for the composite
</p>
<p>system are simply the product of the eigenfunctions of the individual systems, while
</p>
<p>the eigenenergies are the sums of the individual energies. This guess works since

D .E1 C E2/  E1 E2 : (5.147)
</p>
<p>Although this result is extremely simple, students often have trouble accepting or
</p>
<p>remembering it. For two independent systems, the eigenfunctions are products of the
</p>
<p>individual system eigenfunctions and the eigenenergies are the sum of the individual
</p>
<p>system eigenenergies.
</p>
<p>5.3 Measurements in Quantum Mechanics: &ldquo;Collapse&rdquo;
</p>
<p>of the Wave Function
</p>
<p>It has already been stated that a measurement on a single quantum system of a
</p>
<p>dynamic variable yields one and only one eigenvalue of the Hermitian operator
</p>
<p>associated with that dynamic variable. The wave function can be expanded in terms
</p>
<p>of the eigenfunctions of any Hermitian operator, provided the appropriate boundary
</p>
<p>conditions are met. For discrete eigenvalues, this implies that
</p>
<p> .r; t/ D
X
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>ban.t/ an.r/ (5.148)
</p>
<p>where an is an eigenvalue of some operator OA and  an.r/ is the corresponding
eigenfunction. If this operator corresponds to a physical observable, then jban.t/j2
corresponds to the probability that a measurement on a single quantum system
</p>
<p>at time t of the classical variable associated with OA will yield the value an. For
continuous eigenvalues a, this equation is replaced by
</p>
<p> .r; t/ D
Z
</p>
<p>da b.a; t/ a.r/; (5.149)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.3 Measurements in Quantum Mechanics: &ldquo;Collapse&rdquo; of the Wave Function 107
</p>
<p>where jb.a; t/j2 da is the probability that a measurement with on a single quantum
system at time t of the classical variable associated with OA will yield a value between
a and aC da.
</p>
<p>Often it is stated in quantum mechanics texts that the wave function collapses into
</p>
<p>the eigenfunction associated with the eigenvalue that was measured. I have never
</p>
<p>been a big fan of this terminology. I have already noted that any direct measurement
</p>
<p>of a physical variable associated with a quantum system generally modifies the
</p>
<p>system, implying that the state of the system following the measurement is no longer
</p>
<p>the eigenfunction associated with that eigenvalue.
</p>
<p>For example, in the two-slit experiment involving a single particle, the wave
</p>
<p>function before detection on a screen is spread out over an interference pattern
</p>
<p>associated with two-slit interference. One detector on the screen fires, localizing
</p>
<p>the particle, but the state of the particle is altered by the measurement. You can say
</p>
<p>that the measurement has collapsed the wave function, but I do not think this is a
</p>
<p>particularly useful image. Collapse tends to imply a physical collapse of the wave
</p>
<p>function, but quantum mechanics say nothing about the collapse process itself. As
</p>
<p>long as you deal with the probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics you will
</p>
<p>not run into any problems. However if you try to associate a physical mechanism
</p>
<p>with the collapse process, you will be led down a path that seems to lead nowhere.
</p>
<p>Although direct measurement of a physical variable that leaves a quantum system
</p>
<p>in an eigenfunction of the Hermitian operator associated with that variable is
</p>
<p>not possible, indirect measurements of the variable can be made that leave the
</p>
<p>quantum state of the system unchanged. Such measurements fall into two general
</p>
<p>classes: quantum nondemolition measurements on a single quantum system or
</p>
<p>measurements on a correlated or entangled state of a two-particle quantum system.
</p>
<p>In a quantum nondemolition (QND) experiment,3 one measures one of two non-
</p>
<p>commuting operators associated with a quantum system without introducing any
</p>
<p>noise (modification) of the dynamics associated with this operator. All the noise
</p>
<p>that is introduced goes into the dynamics associated with the other operator, but
</p>
<p>that operator is assumed not to appear in the Hamiltonian. In this back-evading
</p>
<p>noise scheme, the operator of interest can be measured with absolute accuracy,
</p>
<p>at least in principle. Such schemes were proposed as a means for measuring the
</p>
<p>small displacements produced on mechanical systems by gravitational waves. Note
</p>
<p>that such a scheme does not work if we measure the position of a free particle to
</p>
<p>arbitrary accuracy. Such a measurement would introduce an uncertainty in the
</p>
<p>momentum that acts back on the particle to modify its subsequent position. On
</p>
<p>the other hand, we could, in principle, measure the momentum of a free particle
</p>
<p>to arbitrary accuracy. Although the measurement would affect the position of the
</p>
<p>particle, the position does not appear in the Hamiltonian. To measure the momentum
</p>
<p>we would have to couple the particle of interest to another quantum system and make
</p>
<p>a measurement of the second quantum system that determines the momentum of the

</p>
<p>Cambridge, U.K., 1997), Chapter 19.</p>

</p>
<p>system of interest, using a method similar to that described in the next paragraph. To
</p>
<p>make QND work, the probe must provide a measure of the quantum variable being
</p>
<p>probed, without affecting its value. For example, when atoms are sent through a
</p>
<p>microwave cavity, they can acquire a phase shift that depends on the microwave
</p>
<p>intensity in the cavity; measuring this phase shift is an indirect way of measuring
</p>
<p>the microwave intensity, without altering its value.4
</p>
<p>In an entangled state measurement, one measures properties of one particle or
</p>
<p>system and infers the properties of the other particle or system. The most famous
</p>
<p>example of this type of measurement is related to the so-called Einstein-Podolsky-
</p>
<p>Rosen (EPR) paradox. We shall see that a particle such as an electron has an intrinsic
</p>
<p>angular momentum and that a measure of the z-component of this intrinsic angular
</p>
<p>momentum can be either &bdquo;=2 (spin ") or �&bdquo;=2 (spin #). The electron is said to have
a spin of 1=2. If a spinless particle decays into two identical spin 1/2 particles, then
</p>
<p>the quantum state of the combined system is
</p>
<p> 1;2 D
1p
2
</p>
<p>�
 1" 2# �  2" 1#
</p>
<p>�
; (5.150)
</p>
<p>since we don&rsquo;t know which particle is in either of the spin states. This is an
</p>
<p>entangled wave function since it cannot be written as the product of individual wave
</p>
<p>functions for each particle. However, if we measure the spin of one of the particles
</p>
<p>as &ldquo;up&rdquo; along some direction we are guaranteed that the other particle is in its spin
</p>
<p>&ldquo;down&rdquo; state along the same direction. In several quantum computation schemes
</p>
<p>one entangles the internal state of an atom with the polarization of the radiation
</p>
<p>emitted from the atom. In this way, a measurement of the polarization of the emitted
</p>
<p>radiation can be correlated with a given superposition of the internal states of the
</p>
<p>atom.

<p>5.4 Summary
</p>
<p>In this chapter, the basic postulates of quantum mechanics were stated. A detailed
</p>
<p>catalogue was constructed giving various properties of Hermitian operators and
</p>
<p>their eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. The central problem in quantum mechanics is
</p>
<p>reduced to finding the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator,
</p>
<p>from which all properties of quantum systems can be derived.
</p>
<p>4Experiments of this type were pioneered in the group of Serge Haroche, who was awarded the
</p>
<p>Nobel prize in recognition of these and other experiments.</p>

<p>Problems in One-Dimension: General
Considerations, Infinite Well Potential,
</p>
<p>Piecewise Constant Potentials, and Delta
Function Potentials
</p>
<p>The simplest solutions of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation are those involving one-
</p>
<p>dimensional problems. Of course, nature is three dimensional, but sometimes
</p>
<p>problems can be reduced to an effective one-dimensional problem. For example,
</p>
<p>if an optical field is incident normally on a dielectric slab, the problem is essentially
</p>
<p>a one-dimensional problem. Even more important, however, is that many features
</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics are illustrated using one-dimensional problems. In this
</p>
<p>chapter, I consider some general features of solutions of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation
</p>
<p>in one dimension, discuss the infinite square well potential, look at other piecewise
</p>
<p>constant potentials, and examine the one-dimensional Dirac delta function potential.
</p>
<p>In the Appendix, I discuss periodic potentials and their relation to so-called Bloch
</p>
<p>state wave functions. The harmonic oscillator potential in one dimension is analyzed
</p>
<p>in Chap. 7.
</p>
<p>6.1 General Considerations
</p>
<p>Without specifying the exact form of the potential, I can characterize the types
</p>
<p>of solutions that can exist in one dimension. That is, I can determine if there
</p>
<p>is energy degeneracy, if bound states might exist, and if the eigenvalues are
</p>
<p>continuous or discrete. For example, we know already that for a free particle in one-
</p>
<p>dimension there is a two-fold energy degeneracy and that the energy eigenvalues are
</p>
<p>continuous. The degeneracy can be understood as arising from the fact that, for the
</p>
<p>same energy, a particle can be moving to the right or left. This can be viewed as a
</p>
<p>left-right degeneracy. In the examples given below, I always set the zero of energy
</p>
<p>such that the potential as jxj ! 1 is positive or zero. In one-dimensional problems
there can never be more than a two-fold degeneracy since the time-independent
</p>
<p>Schr&ouml;dinger equation is a second order ordinary differential equation.

<p>116 6 Problems in One-Dimension: Piecewise Constant Potentials
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.1 Potential barriers
</p>
<p>Motion in classical mechanics can be bounded or unbounded. Bounded, one-
</p>
<p>dimensional motion in classical mechanics is restricted to a finite region of space,
</p>
<p>while unbound motion can extend to either x D 1 and/or x D �1. Bound states
in quantum mechanics correspond to states that are, for the most part, localized to
</p>
<p>finite regions of space. In other words, a necessary condition for a bound state in
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics is that the eigenfunction associated with a bound state goes to
</p>
<p>zero as jxj ! 1 (in three dimensions the eigenfunction must go to zero as r!1).
Unbound states in quantum mechanics correspond to states whose eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>do not vanish for either x D 1 and/or x D �1. The eigenfunctions of the free
particle do not correspond to a bound state. I now examine the classical motion
</p>
<p>and quantum-mechanical properties associated with several generic classes of one-
</p>
<p>dimensional potentials.
</p>
<p>6.1.1 Potentials in which V.x/ &gt; 0 and V .˙1/ � 0
</p>
<p>Potentials falling into this class are shown in Fig. 6.1. In both cases shown, there
</p>
<p>are continuous eigenenergies E &gt; 0 and a two-fold degeneracy for each energy,
</p>
<p>since particles (waves) can be incident from the left or right. Were I to solve
</p>
<p>the time-independent Schr&ouml;dinger equation for potentials of this type, I would
</p>
<p>find that the eigenenergies correspond to all positive energies. Classically, in case
</p>
<p>(a), a particle having energy E1 incident from the left would be reflected by the
</p>
<p>potential. Quantum-mechanically there is some probability that the particle tunnels
</p>
<p>to the other side and is transmitted through the barrier. Tunneling is a wave-like
</p>
<p>phenomenon. A classical particle having energy E2 incident from the left is always</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.1 General Considerations 117
</p>
<p>transmitted with no reflection, although its kinetic energy changes as it moves by the
</p>
<p>potential barrier. Quantum-mechanically there is some probability that the particle
</p>
<p>is reflected. For a potential that varies slowly over a de Broglie wavelength of
</p>
<p>the particle, this reflection is very small, but for a rectangular barrier it can be
</p>
<p>significant. As you shall see, the rectangular barrier case is analogous to one in
</p>
<p>which light is reflected by a dielectric slab. In case (b), classically, a particle having
</p>
<p>energy E1 can be bound if it is located in the potential well. Quantum-mechanically
</p>
<p>there are no bound states, a particle prepared inside the well eventually tunnels
</p>
<p>out. A classical particle having energy E1 incident from the left would always
</p>
<p>be reflected. Quantum-mechanically there is some probability that the particle is
</p>
<p>transmitted as a result of tunneling. A classical particle having energy E2 incident
</p>
<p>from the left would always be transmitted with no reflection. Quantum-mechanically
</p>
<p>there is some probability that the particle is reflected.
</p>
<p>6.1.2 Potentials in which V.x/ &gt; 0 and V .�1/ � 0 while
</p>
<p>V .1/ � 1
</p>
<p>For the potential of (Fig. 6.2) (a), a classical particle is reflected by the potential,
</p>
<p>as is a quantum wave packet incident from the left. Since a wave packet cannot
</p>
<p>be incident from the left, there is no degeneracy, although the eigenenergies are
</p>
<p>continuous. In case (b) there are no bound states quantum-mechanically, although
</p>
<p>there could be bound states classically for energy E1, if the particle is located in the
</p>
<p>potential well.

<p>6.1.3 Potentials in which V.x/ &gt; 0 and V .�1/ � 0 while
</p>
<p>V .1/ D W &gt; 0
</p>
<p>In the case of a step potential (Fig. 6.3), a wave packet cannot be incident from
</p>
<p>the right if E &lt; W. Therefore, for E &lt; W, the eigenenergies are continuous, but
</p>
<p>there is no degeneracy. A wave packet incident from the left is totally reflected.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, for E &gt; W; there are continuous eigenenergies and a two-fold
</p>
<p>degeneracy since wave packets can be incident from the left or right. Classically, a
</p>
<p>particle incident from the left is reflected if E &lt; W and transmitted with reduced
</p>
<p>kinetic energy (with no reflection) if E &gt; W. Quantum mechanically there can be
</p>
<p>some reflection for a wave packet incident from the left having energy E &gt; W.
</p>
<p>6.1.4 Potentials in which V.x/ &gt; 0 and V .˙1/ � 1
</p>
<p>For the potentials of (Fig. 6.4), a wave packet can be incident neither from the right
</p>
<p>nor the left. The wave function must vanish as jxj ! 1. In order to fit the waves in
the potential and satisfy this boundary condition, the energy must take on discrete
</p>
<p>values. There is no degeneracy in this case, but there is an infinite number of discrete
</p>
<p>energies possible. Classically, any energy greater than the minimum value of the
</p>
<p>potential energy is allowed. A particle could be bound in one of the sub-wells in
</p>
<p>case (b) for energy E1. Quantum-mechanically, there are no bound states that are
</p>
<p>localized entirely in only one sub-well.
</p>
<p>6.1.5 Potentials in which V.x/ &lt; 0 and V .˙1/ � 0
</p>
<p>In this case (Fig. 6.5) of a potential well, for E &gt; 0, a wave packet can be incident
</p>
<p>from the left or right. Therefore, for E &gt; 0, the eigenenergies are continuous, and
</p>
<p>there is a two-fold degeneracy. A wave packet incident from the left will be partially
</p>
<p>reflected and partially transmitted. There can also be resonance phenomena, as with</p>

</p>
<p>to a large&#129;x and a correspondingly small&#129;p that is sufficiently small to prevent the

</p>
<p>is bound in the well.
</p>
<p>Other types of potentials are also possible, but you should get the idea by now.
</p>
<p>In bound state one-dimensional problems, there is never energy degeneracy&mdash;the
</p>
<p>actual number of bound states (if any) depends on the details of the potential. For
</p>
<p>one-dimensional problems giving rise to continuous eigenenergies, there is two-fold
</p>
<p>degeneracy if the energy is greater than the potential as jxj ! 1.
Values of x for which E &gt; V.x/ correspond to the classically allowed region for

<p>If V is constant, the solutions are sines or cosines of kx. In general the solution

<p>is oscillatory in such classically allowed regions. On the other hand, values of x
</p>
<p>for which E &lt; V.x/ corresponds to a classically forbidden region for the particle,

<p>6.2 Infinite Well Potential
</p>
<p>An important model problem in one dimension is the infinite square well potential,
</p>
<p>represented schematically in Fig. 6.6. The potential vanishes between the &ldquo;walls&rdquo; of

<p>6.2 Infinite Well Potential 121
</p>
<p>the potential and is infinite otherwise. This is a wonderful problem since it illustrates
</p>
<p>many of the features of bound state problems in quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>First, consider the classical problem. A particle having mass m is constrained
</p>
<p>to move between the walls of the potential having width a. Between the walls, the
</p>
<p>particle acts as a free particle having speed v, momentum p D ˙mvux (C if it
moves to the right and � if it moves to the left) and energy E D mv2=2. When
the particle hits the wall, it undergoes an elastic collision in which the sign of its
</p>
<p>velocity (and momentum) is changed, but its energy remains unchanged. Since the
</p>
<p>velocity changes direction on collisions with the walls, momentum is not conserved.
</p>
<p>Also, since the velocity changes on collisions with the walls, the particle accelerates
</p>
<p>during each collision. The particle can have any kinetic energy whatsoever (the
</p>
<p>potential energy is zero inside the box), which remains constant during the particle&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>motion, and the position of the particle is determined precisely as it moves back and
</p>
<p>forth between the two walls.
</p>
<p>What are the classical (time-averaged) distribution functions for this particle?
</p>
<p>The energy is fixed so the energy distribution is a Dirac delta function. For a given
</p>
<p>energy E, however, two possible momenta are possible,
</p>

</p>
<p>On the other hand, on average, the particle is found with equal probability anywhere
</p>
<p>in the well, so the time-averaged spatial distribution is
</p>
<p>Pclass.x/ D
1
</p>
<p>a
: (6.5)
</p>
<p>Of course, the particle follows a classical trajectory given some initial condition; in
</p>
<p>other words, the probability density for the particle is always a Dirac delta function
</p>
<p>centered at the classical particle position. That is, the classical particle mass density
</p>
<p>is given by
</p>
<p>�.x; t/ D mı.x � x.t//; (6.6)
</p>
<p>where x.t/ is the position of the particle at time t.
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s turn to the quantum problem. The Hamiltonian for the particle when it
</p>
<p>is between the walls is just the free particle Hamiltonian,

<p>in this region. I have some freedom in choosing the origin of the coordinate
</p>
<p>system. If I take the well centered at x D 0; the potential is symmetric about the
origin and the Hamiltonian commutes with the parity operator. With this choice
</p>
<p>the eigenfunctions must have definite parity, since there is no energy degeneracy
</p>
<p>in this problem. On the other hand, if I take the well located between 0 and a,
</p>
<p>the Hamiltonian does not commute with the parity operator and the eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>do not possess definite parity (this is clear since the wave function must vanish
</p>
<p>for x &lt; 0 in this case). Of course the eigenenergies must be the same, since the
</p>
<p>particle&rsquo;s energy must be independent of the choice of origin. Let&rsquo;s solve for the
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions and eigenenergies using both coordinate systems.

</p>
<p>The fact that the potential is infinite at the wall leads us to the assumption that the
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions must vanish for jxj � a=2; that is, the particle cannot penetrate into
the walls. The boundary condition
</p>
<p> E.˙a=2/ D 0 (6.10)
</p>
<p>can be obtained formally by taking a finite height for the potential in the regions
</p>
<p>jxj &gt; a=2, and then letting this height approach infinity. To solve Eq. (6.8) in the
region �a=2 &lt; x &lt; a=2, I guess a solution. It is not difficult to show that any of

</p>
<p>6.2.3 Position and Momentum Distributions
</p>
<p>The dimensionless probability distribution a j n.x/j2 is shown in Fig. 6.8 for n D 1
and n D 10 for the well located between �a=2 and a=2. You see that, for n D 1;
the function is &ldquo;bell-shaped,&rdquo; but for n D 10, there are many oscillations. If I
average these oscillations for large n; I find that
</p>
<p>D
j n.x/j2
</p>
<p>E
D 1=a, in agreement
</p>
<p>with the classical distribution given in Eq. (6.5), suggesting that j n.x/j2 can be
interpreted as a probability distribution. This is a bit of a swindle, however, since,
</p>
<p>in a state of given n, the quantum probability distribution is very different from the
</p>
<p>classical one. The classical distribution is a delta function centered at the classical
</p>
<p>particle position, while there are many places in the quantum distribution where
</p>
<p>the particle cannot be found at all. To get a true classical limit, you must take a
</p>
<p>superposition of a large number of quantum states to form a wave packet that will
</p>
<p>bounce back and forth between the walls with minimal spreading, simulating the
</p>
<p>classical particle motion. On the other hand, I have uncovered an important link
</p>
<p>between the classical and quantum problem. In the limit of large quantum numbers
</p>
<p>(high n), the quantum distribution, averaged over oscillations in the classically
</p>
<p>allowed region is approximately equal to the time-averaged classical particle density
</p>
<p>for a particle having an energy equal to that associated with the quantum state n.
</p>
<p>The situation in momentum space is a bit closer to the classical picture. The

<p>6.3 Piecewise Constant Potentials
</p>
<p>I now examine problems involving piecewise constant potentials. In other words, I
</p>
<p>look at problems in which the potential is constant in several regions, but undergoes
</p>
<p>point jump discontinuities between regions. An analogous problem in optics is
</p>
<p>transmission and reflection of light at a dielectric surface, in which the index of
</p>
<p>refraction is constant on either side of the dielectric interface, but undergoes a
</p>
<p>point jump discontinuity at the interface. Of course, no physical boundary can
</p>
<p>be infinitely sharp. In the optical case, the change in index is assumed to occur
</p>
<p>over a distance small compared with a wavelength, which can be satisfied quite
</p>
<p>easily using polished surfaces. In quantum mechanics, it is assumed that the change
</p>
<p>in the potential occurs over a distance that is small compared to a de Broglie</p>

<p>about these complications for the moment and begin a systematic attack on this

<p>problem. I concentrate on solutions of the time-independent Schr&ouml;dinger equation,
</p>
<p>but discuss wave packet dynamics as well. In problems involving reflection and
</p>
<p>transmission, I use the probability current density to obtain the reflection and
</p>
<p>transmission coefficients. I will not be concerned about normalizing the wave
</p>
<p>functions in problems involving reflection and transmission; I simply calculate
</p>
<p>the ratio of transmitted and reflected probability current densities to the incident
</p>
<p>probability current density.

</p>
<p>There is a point jump discontinuity in the potential at x D 0, but, as long as
the potential contains no singularities or infinities, both the wave function and its
</p>
<p>derivative are continuous at all points, since they are solutions of a well-behaved,
</p>
<p>second order, linear differential equation. To obtain the eigenfunctions, I solve
</p>
<p>Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation for x &lt; 0 and for x &gt; 0 and then equate the wave functions
</p>
<p>of the two solutions and their derivatives at x D 0. On physical grounds, the
continuity of the wave function is consistent with the idea that the probability
</p>
<p>density must be a single valued function.
</p>
<p>The procedure I follow for the step potential can be used in any problem
</p>
<p>involving piecewise constant potentials. That is, I solve the Schr&ouml;dinger equation
</p>
<p>in each region of constant potential and use the continuity of the wave function
</p>
<p>and its derivative to connect the solutions. Additional boundary conditions are often
</p>
<p>needed for the solutions as jxj ! 1. For the potential step, I consider E &lt; V0 and
E &gt; V0 separately.</p>

<p>6.3.1.1 E &lt; V0
</p>
<p>In the classical problem, a particle that approaches the barrier is reflected with the
</p>
<p>same speed. In the quantum-mechanical problem, I could simulate the classical
</p>
<p>problem by sending a wave packet towards the barrier. When I discuss scattering
</p>
<p>theory in Chap. 17, you will see that the wave packet actually penetrates into the
</p>
<p>barrier, but is then totally reflected with a time delay that depends on .V0 � E/ =E.
In this chapter, I consider the time-independent problem only and calculate the
</p>
<p>reflection coefficient using the probability current density.
</p>
<p>I need to solve the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for x &lt; 0 and for x &gt; 0 and then
</p>
<p>match the wave functions of the two regions and their derivatives at x D 0. I know
already that the eigenvalues are continuous and there is no degeneracy. For region I,

<p>The general solution of this equation is exponentials or sines and cosines. It is better
</p>
<p>to choose exponentials since it will then be possible to interpret the results in terms
</p>
<p>of an incident and reflected probability current. Although there is no degeneracy I
</p>
<p>must take the most general possible solution of Eq. (6.46) or I will not be able to
</p>
<p>match the two boundary conditions at x D 0 for the continuity of the wave function
and its derivative. Thus I take
</p>

<p>to see this, as I do in Chap. 17). The problem is analogous to total reflection of light
</p>
<p>by a lossless plasma, when the frequency of the light is below the plasma frequency.
</p>
<p>In the limit that V0 !1; C=A � 0, consistent with the assumption that the wave
function vanishes in extended regions where there is an infinite potential. Moreover,
</p>
<p>as V0 ! 1, B=A � �1 in Eq. (6.54a), which implies a phase change of � on
reflection. Therefore, as V0 !1, Eq. (6.52) reduces to

: (6.58)
</p>
<p>The eigenfunctions are now standing waves, with a node at x D 0. The analogous
situation for electromagnetic radiation is reflection at a perfect metal, where the
</p>
<p>tangential component of the electric field must vanish at the surface.
</p>
<p>Another interesting limit occurs for E � V0 (E D V0 � �, with 0 &lt; � � V0/, for
which B=A � 1; C=A � 2, and

</p>
<p>In this limit the intensity reflection coefficient is still equal to unity, but there is no

<p>phase change on reflection. The wave function penetrates deeply into the potential
</p>
<p>step. In the classically allowed region the wave functions is a standing wave with
</p>
<p>an antinode at x D 0. If a wave packet having fairly well-defined energy E � V0 is
incident on the potential step, there is a long time delay before the packet is totally
</p>
<p>reflected.
</p>
<p>6.3.1.2 E &gt; V0
</p>
<p>In the classical problem, a particle approaches the potential step and is transmitted
</p>
<p>with a lower speed. There is no reflection in the classical problem. In the quantum-
</p>
<p>mechanical problem, a wave packet incident on the potential step is partially
</p>
<p>transmitted and partially reflected, with the reflection coefficient depending on
</p>
<p>.E � V0/ =E. The eigenenergies are continuous and there is a two-fold degeneracy.

</p>
<p>however, I will run into problems with such a solution. There are four unknowns

<p>in this equation. Using the boundary conditions at x D 0 gives two constraints
(continuity of the wave function and its derivative) and normalization a third, but I
</p>
<p>am one short since I need four constraints. The reason for this dilemma is that there
</p>
<p>is a two-fold degeneracy in this problem. I must take two independent solutions for
</p>
<p>each energy. One way of doing this is to arbitrarily set one of the coefficients equal
</p>
<p>to zero in each of two separate solutions.
</p>
<p>I do this in a manner that allows me simulate waves incident from the left or

<p>Thus, even though the particle speed decreases, the effective index is less than unity.
</p>
<p>The analogue with reflection at a dielectric is not exact, although the results take on
</p>
<p>the same form. Changes in the incident wavelength for light do not seriously affect
</p>
<p>the index of refraction, but the effective index depends in a significant way on the
</p>
<p>incident energy for matter waves.
</p>
<p>In solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for both E &lt; V0 and E &gt; V0, I automatically
</p>
<p>determined the eigenergies and the eigenfunctions. For E &lt; V0, I found that any
</p>
<p>energy in the range 0 &lt; E &lt; V0 gives rise to a solution and that the eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>are nondegenerate. For E &gt; V0, I found that any energy gives rise to a doubly-
</p>
<p>degenerate solution.

<p>6.3.2 Square Well Potential

<p>Now I turn my attention to the square well potential shown in Fig. 6.12 for which
</p>
<p>V.x/ D
�
�V0 &lt; 0 jxj &lt; a=2
0 jxj &gt; a=2 : (6.75)
</p>
<p>I consider E &lt; 0 and E &gt; 0 separately. I must solve the Schr&ouml;dinger equation in
</p>
<p>three regions, x &lt; �a=2, �a=2 &lt; x &lt; a=2, x &gt; a=2, and equate the wave functions
of the solutions and their derivatives at x D �a=2 and x D a=2.
</p>
<p>6.3.2.1 E &lt; 0
</p>
<p>In the classical problem, a particle is always bound in the well for E &lt; 0. In the
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics problem, you will see that there is always at least one bound
</p>
<p>state. However, the wave function penetrates into the classically forbidden regime.
</p>
<p>You might think that there is no bound state for sufficiently small well depths
</p>
<p>based on the following argument. Since &#129;x is of order a; &#129;p is of order &bdquo;=a,</p>

<p>finite number of bound states En for negative energies. The number of bound states is equal to the

<p>integer value of .1C ˇ=�/, where ˇ2 D 2mV0a2=&bdquo;2
</p>

not deep enough to bind the particle. You will see what is wrong with this argument
</p>
<p>after I analyze the problem in detail.
</p>
<p>For E &lt; 0; the eigenenergies are discrete and there is no degeneracy. I can

by Eqs. (6.108) and (6.109). For example, a wave packet having spatial width less

<p>than a could never have a transmission resonance at low energy&mdash;it would be totally

<p>The analogy between the quantum and radiation problems is useful only when

</p>
<p>analogy breaks down for wave packets or radiation pulses whose spatial extents are

<p>much smaller than the scattering region. For example, you can see from Eq. (6.112)</p>

<p>be taken over directly by replacing �V0 with V0 in Eqs. (6.111) and (6.105b). In the
classical problem, a particle is always reflected by the barrier when E &lt; V0. In the
</p>
<p>quantum-mechanical problem, you will see that the particle can tunnel through the
</p>
<p>barrier. The eigenenergies are continuous and there is a two-fold degeneracy.

<p>I should now equate the wave functions in the various regions and their derivatives
</p>
<p>at both at x D 0 and x D a. It is not necessary to do so, however, since a

T � 0, which is the strong barrier limit. On the other hand, for ˇ2V0=4E � 1,
the transmission goes to unity. If you consider the problem of transmission for a

<p>6.5 Summary
</p>
<p>I have examined a number of prototypical one-dimensional problems in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics involving piecewise constant potentials. In all these problems, I was
</p>
<p>able to solve the Schr&ouml;dinger equation in a number of distinct regions and piece
</p>
<p>together the solutions using the continuity of the wave function and its derivative.
</p>
<p>In considering the motion of particles in potentials that change abruptly at a given
</p>
<p>point, we always encounter wave-like properties of the particles since the potential
</p>
<p>changes in a distance small compared with the de Broglie wavelength of the particle.
</p>
<p>In the limit that &bdquo; ! 0 in such problems, we recover the geometrical or ray
optics limit of optics for light incident on a dielectric interface. Processes such as
</p>
<p>transmission and reflection resonances, as well as tunneling, have optical analogues.
</p>
<p>6.6 Appendix: Periodic Potentials
</p>
<p>To arrive at the band structure of solids, one often models the problem of electrons
</p>
<p>interacting with atomic sites in a crystal by considering the electrons to move in a
</p>
<p>periodic potential having period d. If periodic boundary conditions are imposed, it
</p>
<p>is possible to find eigenfunctions  E.x/ that satisfy Bloch&rsquo;s theorem,
</p>
<p> E.x/ D ei˛x=duE.x/; (6.138)
</p>
<p>where uE.x/ is a periodic function having period d and ˛ is the Bloch phase. Both
</p>
<p>˛ and uE.x/ are functions of the energy E and the detailed nature of the potential.
</p>
<p>It is possible to relate the Bloch states to the transmission resonances that occur
</p>
<p>when matter waves are incident on an equally spaced array of identical potential
</p>
<p>barriers.5 The problem can then be mapped onto one involving periodic boundary
</p>
<p>conditions by imposing the requirement that the wave function at the entrance of
</p>
<p>the array be equal to the wave function at the exit. I will consider only the problem
</p>
<p>of the transmission resonances in detail, but then make a connection with the Bloch
</p>
<p>states.
</p>

</p>

<p>6.6.1 Bloch States
</p>
<p>The Bloch theory of a crystal assumes a periodic potential in all space. Of course,
</p>
<p>no crystal exists in all space, so what is usually done is to imagine the periodic
</p>
<p>potential on a ring, that is, N identical delta function potentials, periodically placed
</p>
<p>on a ring [see Fig. 6.16b]. I can map the ring, having radius R; onto a line of length
</p>
<p>L D 2�R D Nd with  .x D 0/ D  .x D L=d/; and
</p>
<p>� D 2�x=N: (6.154)
</p>
<p>The ring radius R grows with increasing N for fixed d.
</p>
<p>It can be shown that the Bloch energies correspond to a subset of the solutions
</p>
<p>associated with Eq. (6.153), containing those values for which TN D 1; but not those
for TN D �1. The wave functions with TN D �1 are out of phase by � when they
return to the same physical point. This implies that there are approximately half as
</p>
<p>many Bloch state energies as transmission energies, but each of these Bloch states
</p>
<p>is two-fold degenerate, since waves can move either clockwise or counterclockwise.
</p>
<p>Moreover, there are additional Bloch energies that occur that are absent in the
</p>
<p>transmission resonances, namely values of � which are equal to zero or � .
</p>
<p>As a consequence, the energy &ldquo;bands,&rdquo; each contain .N C 2/ =2 discrete energy
levels for N even and .N C 1/ =2 discrete energy levels for N odd: The discrete
energies correspond to the transmission resonances for which TN D 1, plus an
energy eigenfunction for � D 0 and, if N is even, an additional one for � D � . Each
state is two-fold degenerate, except for those corresponding to � D 0 or � . Thus
there are 2 Œ.N C 2/ =2 � 2&#141;C2 D N states for N even and 2 Œ.N C 1/ =2 � 1&#141;C1 D
N states for N odd. Each band contains exactly N states. Note that as N ! 1, the
number of states in each band goes to infinity but the states remain discrete. Despite
</p>
<p>the fact that these states remain discrete, the resulting structure is referred to as the
</p>
<p>(continuous) band structure of solids.

<p>Simple Harmonic Oscillator: One Dimension
</p>
<p>In the case of piecewise constant potentials, solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation was
</p>
<p>relatively easy. I obtained solutions in the various spatial regions where the potential
</p>
<p>was constant and matched the wave functions and their derivatives at places where
</p>
<p>the potential underwent a point jump discontinuity. In certain cases, additional
</p>
<p>boundary conditions had to be imposed for x � 1 and/or x � �1. For arbitrary
continuous potentials, the Schr&ouml;dinger equation must be solved as an entity and, in
</p>
<p>general, such a solution must be carried out numerically. The numerical methods
</p>
<p>generally involve the use a discretized form of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, in
</p>
<p>which the kinetic energy operator and the potential are approximated on a finite
</p>
<p>grid of points. Different approaches can then be used to obtain the eigenergies
</p>
<p>and eigenfunctions.1 For certain potentials such as the gravitational-like potential
</p>
<p>V.x/ D mgx, the smooth potential well potential, V.x/ D �V0 sech2 .x=a/, and

<p>it is possible to get solutions in terms of so-called special functions of mathematical

</p>
<p>In this chapter I study the harmonic oscillator potential. As you will see, an analytic

<p>164 7 Simple Harmonic Oscillator: One Dimension
</p>
<p>The potential for a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) associated with a particle
</p>
<p>having mass m subjected to a restoring force �

</p>
<p>m!2x2: (7.2)
</p>
<p>Aside from this being the potential characterizing a particle bound by an ideal
</p>
<p>spring, it is the approximate potential for any interaction potential that has a point
</p>
<p>of stable equilibrium located at x D 0; since, in the region about x D 0,

<p>equivalent problem of a particle having mass m moving in a SHO potential. For
</p>
<p>example, in optical lattices, standing wave laser fields are used to trap atoms at the
</p>
<p>bottom of potential wells that can be approximated as harmonic oscillator potentials.
</p>
<p>The interaction potential between the nuclei of diatomic molecules can also be
</p>
<p>approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential, giving rise to vibrational energy
</p>
<p>levels.
</p>
<p>7.1 Classical Problem
</p>
<p>Most likely, you have already studied the dynamics of a classical, simple harmonic
</p>
<p>oscillator. The harmonic oscillator potential is amazing in that the motion is periodic
</p>
<p>with (angular) frequency !, no matter how you start the oscillator. It returns to its
</p>
<p>initial position and velocity at all integral multiples of its period, T D 2�=!. The
particle spends the least amount of time near x D 0 since it is moving fastest there
and the most amount of time near the endpoints of its orbit,

</p>
<p>The position of the oscillator as a function of time is given by
</p>
<p>x D xmax cos .!t/ ; (7.5)
</p>
<p>assuming the particle starts with maximum displacement. The time-averaged prob-
</p>
<p>ability density Pclass.x/ to find the particle between x and xC dx is just the fraction
of a half period that the particle is located between x and xC dx, namely

momentum probability density is smallest at x D ˙xmax (where p D 0) and a
maximum at x D 0 (where p D ˙jpmaxj). In fact, owing to the symmetry of
the Hamiltonian on exchange of momentum and position when both are expressed
</p>
<p>in dimensionless variables [see Eq. (7.13) below], the time-averaged momentum
</p>
<p>probability density Wclass.p/ has the same form as Pclass.x/, namely

</p>
<p>We already know a great deal about the solutions of the oscillator problem. The
</p>
<p>energy levels are discrete and there is no energy degeneracy. Since the Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>commutes with the parity operator, the eigenfunctions must also be eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>of the parity operator, that is, they must be either even or odd functions of x.
</p>
<p>Moreover we expect the ground state wave function to be a symmetric bell-shaped
</p>
<p>curve centered at x D 0 (though not a sin function), the first excited state wave
function to be an antisymmetric function with a node at the origin, the second
</p>
<p>excited state wave function to be symmetric about the origin with two nodes, etc.
</p>
<p>Without loss of generality I can label the lowest energy state by n D 0, the first
excited state by n D 1; etc.

<p>A lower bound for the ground state energy can be obtained using the uncertainty

<p>En D &bdquo;! .nm C C/ for a positive integer m; but it is not hard to argue that m must be
equal to one. We have already seen that the infinite square well energy levels vary
</p>
<p>as n2. Since the SHO potential is less steep than the infinite well, its energy levels
</p>
<p>must vary with n less rapidly than n2; the only integral value of m that will work

<p>As I often stress, you can solve a differential equation only if you know the

</p>
<p>the asymptotic form of the wave functions. We know the solution must go to zero as

<p>jxj ! 1. In the case of a square well potential, the bound state eigenfunctions vary
as exp .�� jxj/ for large jxj : Since the oscillator, potential increases with increasing
jxj, we would expect a faster fall-off for the eigenfunctions.

<p>7.3 Summary
</p>
<p>In obtaining the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the SHO, I have solved one of
</p>
<p>the most important elementary problems in quantum mechanics. Many potentials
</p>
<p>are modeled as harmonic oscillator potentials, so these solutions are used in a wide
</p>
<p>range of applications. I did not go through a detailed derivation of the series solution
</p>
<p>of Hermite&rsquo;s equation, since it can be found in any standard mathematical physics
</p>
<p>text. Basically one assumes a series solution, obtains the recursion relation for the
</p>
<p>coefficients, and argues that the series must terminate, or the solution would diverge
</p>
<p>for large jxj. In this way, you obtain the quantization condition.
</p>
<p>7.4 Problems
</p>
<p>1. How do you know the eigenfunctions of the 1-D oscillator must be even or odd?
</p>
<p>How many nodes are there for Q n .�/? Based on the general solution of the time-
dependent Schr&ouml;dinger equation and properties of the simple harmonic oscillator,
</p>
<p>give an argument to show that the frequency difference between any two energy
</p>
<p>levels must be an integer times !, where ! is the oscillator frequency. In general, to
</p>
<p>form a wave packet that corresponds to a particle having energy E D 1 J moving in
a well having frequency 1Hz, how many states would be needed?
</p>
<p>2. Write the normalized eigenfunctions Q n.�/ of the harmonic oscillator and plot

</p>
<p>Moreover, the numerical solutions may be difficult to obtain. However there are

<p>in this problem for m &curren; 0 since states having ˙m must have the same energy since
the potential is invariant under a rotation about the z axis. In the case of problems

<p>8.3 Summary
</p>
<p>I have taken a brief excursion to look at some simple problems in two and

<p>three dimensions. In problems lacking some global symmetries, it is possible to

<p>arrive at some systematic solution of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation only for separable

<p>Hamiltonians.

<p>8.4 Problems
</p>
<p>1. Prove that the trial solution (8.4) is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian (8.3) if

<p>Eq. (8.5) holds.

<p>2. Find the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies of an infinite, two-dimensional square

<p>V.x; y/ D 0 0 � x � L; 0 � y � L

<p>and is infinite otherwise. In general, there is at least a two-fold degeneracy of the
</p>
<p>energy levels, but, in certain cases, show that there can be no degeneracy or greater
</p>
<p>than two-fold degeneracy.
</p>
<p>3. Prove that the energy degeneracy for the isotropic 2-D oscillator is .nC 1/ and
that for the isotropic 3-D oscillator is .nC 1/ .nC 2/ =2.

<p>Central Forces and Angular Momentum
</p>
<p>I have been dealing mainly with problems involving one-dimensional motion. Since
</p>
<p>nature is three-dimensional, I want to look at solutions of Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation
</p>
<p>in three dimensions. I consider only problems having spherical symmetry, that is,
</p>
<p>potentials that are a function of r only. These correspond to central forces. Moreover,
</p>
<p>for the most part, I restrict the discussion to bound state problems, such as the
</p>
<p>important problem of determining the bound states of the hydrogen atom. Problems
</p>
<p>related to continuum states will be discussed in the context of scattering theory
</p>
<p>in Chap. 18. Since angular momentum is conserved for central forces, we are led
</p>
<p>naturally to the quantum theory of angular momentum. It is important to remember,
</p>
<p>however, that the results to be derived for the angular momentum operator are valid
</p>
<p>independent of the specific nature of the interaction potential, spherically symmetric
</p>
<p>or not.
</p>
<p>9.1 Classical Problem
</p>
<p>In classical physics, the concept of angular momentum plays a critical role in central
</p>
<p>force motion. A particle having mass m, velocity v, and momentum p D mv moving
in a central potential V .r/ experiences a force given by
</p>
<p>F D �rV .r/ D �dV .r/
dr
</p>
<p>ur; (9.1)
</p>
<p>where ur is a unit vector in the r direction. The torque � on the particle vanishes,
</p>
<p>� D r � F D 0; (9.2)

</p>
<p>9.2 Quantum Problem
</p>
<p>9.2.1 Angular Momentum
</p>
<p>The classical definition of angular momentum can be taken over to the quantum
</p>
<p>domain; that is, a Hermitian angular momentum operator in quantum mechanics
</p>
<p>can be defined as
</p>
<p>OL D Or � Op D OLxux C OLyuy C OLzuz; (9.15)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>OLx D OyOpz � OzOpyI (9.16a)
OLy D OzOpx � OxOpzI (9.16b)
OLz D OxOpy � OyOpx: (9.16c)
</p>
<p>You can show easily that OL is Hermitian (recall that the product of any two Hermi-
tian operators is Hermitian if the operators commute). Since the angular momentum
</p>
<p>is a constant of the motion, we expect it to commute with the Hamiltonian. Before
</p>
<p>proving this, let me establish some basic commutation properties of the angular
</p>
<p>momentum operators. The commutator of OLx and OLy is</p>
<p/>

�
OxOpy � OyOpx
</p>
<p>�
D i&bdquo;OLz: (9.17)
</p>
<p>In obtaining this result you do not have to worry about the order of commuting
</p>
<p>operators. I can cycle this relation by letting x! y; y! z; z! x, to obtain
h
OLy; OLz
</p>
<p>i
D i&bdquo;OLxI (9.18a)
</p>
<p>h
OLz; OLx
</p>
<p>i
D i&bdquo;OLy: (9.18b)
</p>
<p>The different components of the angular momentum operator do not commute, so
</p>
<p>it is not possible to measure two components simultaneously. If we knew all three
</p>
<p>components of the angular momentum simultaneously, it would imply that we could
</p>
<p>simultaneously measure both the position and momentum of the particle precisely,
</p>
<p>which would constitute a violation of the uncertainty principle.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.2 Quantum Problem 189
</p>
<p>Since the individual components of OL do not commute it is not possible to
find simultaneous eigenfunctions of OLx; OLy; OLz. As you will see, the eigenvalues
of one component of OL are not sufficient to uniquely label the degenerate energy
eigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian in problems having spherical symmetry. A new
</p>
<p>operator is needed that commutes with both OL and OH. An operator that satisfies
these requirements is the square of the angular momentum operator, defined by
</p>
<p>OL2 D OL2x C OL2y C OL2z ; (9.21)
</p>
<p>since
</p>

</p>
<p>h
OL2; Op2

</p>
<p>h
OL2; OH
</p>
<p>i

</p>
<p>for spherically symmetric potentials. In effect, eigenvalues of the operator OL2
determine what values of the magnitude of the angular momentum can be measured
</p>
<p>in a quantum system. Since

</p>
<p>it is possible to find simultaneous eigenfunctions of OL2, OH; and (any) one component
of OL for a spherically symmetric potential. It turns out that the eigenvalues of OH; OL2;
and (any) one component of OL can be used to uniquely label the eigenfunctions of
the Hamiltonian associated with spherically symmetric potentials.

<p>9.2.1.1 Eigenfunctions of OL2 and OL

</p>
<p>The quantum number ` is referred to as the azimuthal or angular momentum
</p>
<p>quantum number.
</p>
<p>Before looking at the eigenfunctions in more detail, I can summarize the results
</p>
<p>so far. Classically the magnitude squared of the angular momentum L2 can take
</p>
<p>on any value from zero to infinity and Lz can take on continuous values from
</p>
<p>�L to L. In quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of OL2 are limited to the set of
discrete (quantized) values 0&bdquo;2; 2&bdquo;2; 6&bdquo;2; : : : ` .`C 1/ &bdquo;2. For each value of `, the
eigenvalues of OLz (or of any component of angular momentum, for that matter) vary
from �`&bdquo; to `&bdquo; in integral steps of &bdquo;. In other words, for each value of `, there
.2`C 1/ values of m that are allowed.
</p>
<p>Moreover, in quantum mechanics, we cannot know the vector angular momen-
</p>
<p>tum exactly since the components of OL do not commute. We can specify the
magnitude of the angular momentum and one of its components, say Lz, but then
</p>
<p>there is uncertainty in both Lx and Ly. All we know about these other components is
</p>
<p>that they are constrained by
</p>
<p>L2x C L2y D L2 � L2z : (9.46)
</p>
<p>In other words, there is an uncertainty cone of Lx and Ly having radius�
` .`C 1/ � m2
</p>
<p>�1=2 &bdquo; for a given value of ` and m. I will return to a discussion
of the physical interpretation of angular momentum in quantum mechanics after I
</p>
<p>look at the eigenfunctions.
</p>
<p>You might be wondering about the result that the magnitude of the angular
</p>
<p>momentum is quantized in units of
p
` .`C 1/&bdquo; and not `&bdquo;. This follows from
</p>
<p>solving the eigenvalue equation, but there does not seem to be a simple geometric
</p>
<p>interpretation of this result as there was for Lz. Based on the uncertainty principle,
</p>
<p>you can rule out the possibility that L2 D .`&bdquo;/2 . If this were the case for integer `
and if the maximum value of m is equal to `; then the state of maximum ` would
</p>
<p>have no uncertainty in L2x C L2y , which is impossible since OLz does not commute
with OLx and OLy. You can also derive the result if you assume that ` is integral and
that m takes on integral values from �` to `. With this assumption, for a spherically
symmetric state</p>

<p>9.2.2 Physical Interpretation of the Spherical Harmonics
</p>
<p>I now return to a discussion of the physics. It should be clear by now that the angular
</p>
<p>momentum operator plays an important role in central force problems since it is a
</p>
<p>constant of the motion. In the classical problem, suppose the angular momentum
</p>
<p>is in the positive z direction, L D Luz. This means the orbit is in the xy plane and
there is � dependence in a specific orbit, e.g. an elliptical orbit in which the semi-
</p>
<p>major axis is along x: For a given value of energy and angular momentum, the �
</p>
<p>dependence is determined by the initial conditions. If, on the other hand, we average
</p>
<p>over all possible initial conditions having the same energy E and angular momentum
</p>
<p>L D Luz, there cannot be any � dependence owing to the overall symmetry about
the z-axis. In some sense, quantum mechanics does this averaging for you with
</p>
<p>respect to the eigenfunctions. This is the reason why
ˇ̌
Ym` .�; �/
</p>
<p>ˇ̌2
is independent
</p>
<p>of �.
</p>
<p>You will see in the next chapter that the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian for
</p>
<p>spherically symmetric potentials that are simultaneous eigenfunction of OL2 and OLz
can be written quite generally as
</p>
<p> E`m .r/ D RE`.r/Ym` .�; �/ ; (9.56)
</p>
<p>where RE`.r/ is a radial wave function. Since
ˇ̌
Ym` .�; �/
</p>
<p>ˇ̌2
is independent of � , I
</p>
<p>can define an angular probability distribution for the polar angle � by
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.2 Quantum Problem 197
</p>
<p>It is fairly amazing that, for fixed ` and m, the angular probability distribution
</p>
<p>W`m.�/ associated with an eigenfunction of a spherically symmetric potential is
</p>
<p>the same for all central forces, independent of the energy.
</p>
<p>It is a simple matter to plot W`m.�/ as a function of � . Graphs of W`m.�/ are
</p>
<p>shown as the solid red curves in Figs. 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 for ` D 50 and m D 50; 25; 0,
respectively. There are .` � jmj/ zeroes in W`m.�/ for 0 &lt; � &lt; � , reflecting the fact
that there are .` � jmj/ nodes in Pm` .cos �/. This is similar to what we found for the
energy eigenfunctions for one-dimensional potentials. In this case, however, there
</p>
<p>are zero nodes for jmj D ` and a new node appears with each decrease in the value
of jmj.
</p>
<p>The question that remains, however, is &ldquo;What is the physical significance of these
</p>
<p>curves?&rdquo; To answer this question, I can make a comparison with the corresponding
</p>
<p>classical problem. In the limit of large quantum numbers, the quantum probability
</p>
<p>distribution, averaged over oscillations in the classically allowed region, should
</p>
<p>be approximately equal to the classical probability distribution, averaged over all
</p>
<p>possible initial conditions consistent with the constant values of energy, magnitude
</p>
<p>of angular momentum, and z-component of angular momentum.
</p>
<p>To compare the classical and quantum probability distributions, I must specify
</p>
<p>the values of the angular momentum that are consistent with the conserved
</p>
<p>quantities of the quantum problem. In other words, I set
</p>
<p>L D
p
` .`C 1/&bdquo; (9.59)
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>Lz D m&bdquo;: (9.60)
</p>
<p>With these values, the classical angular momentum can be located anywhere on an
</p>
<p>uncertainty cone (see Fig. 9.4) for which
</p>
<p>L2x C L2y D L2 � L2z : (9.61)
</p>
<p>Figure 9.4 can help you to understand the nature of the classical motion. Since
</p>
<p>the motion is in a plane perpendicular to L, for any position of L on the uncertainty
</p>
<p>cone, the motion must be confined to polar angles
</p>
<p>�=2 � cos�1 .Lz=L/ � � � �=2C cos�1 .Lz=L/ ; (9.62)

<p>In Figs. 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3, the classical distribution function is shown as the dashed

<p>class D 1=� ; the classical angle distribution, averaged
over all possible initial conditions, is constant. Since the motion is in a plane

<p>the resultant time-averaged angular probability distribution must be independent
</p>
<p>of � . For values of ` � 1, the quantum probability distribution, averaged over
oscillations in the classically allowed region, is approximately equal to the classical

<p>probability distribution.
</p>
<p>Returning to the quantum problem, I note that the eigenfunction with m D `
comes closest to the classical state in which the angular momentum is in the z

<p>strict uncertainty relation since there is no Hermitian operator that corresponds to

<p>angle. For values of m &curren; `, the values of both &#129;L and &#129;� increase.
The key point to remember is that the motion in the � direction is, for the

<p>most part, restricted to a range of angles given by Eq. (9.63) when the system is
</p>
<p>in an eigenstate of OL2 and OLz. There is no � dependence in the angular probability
distribution because I have chosen eigenfunctions of OL2 and OLz. Had I chosen OL2
and OLx the eigenfunctions would be linear combinations of the Ym` .�; �/ ; and
the absolute square of an eigenfunction could depend on �, but it would be a
</p>
<p>function only of the angle that L makes with the x-axis (see problems). The

<p>a spherically symmetric Hamiltonian and the operators OL2 and OLz does not depend
in any way on the specific form of the potential.</p>

<p>9.3 Summary
</p>
<p>We have seen that angular momentum plays a critical role in problems having
</p>
<p>spherical symmetry. I obtained the eigenvalues and simultaneous eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>of the operators OL2 and OLz. Moreover I was able to make a correspondence with
the analogous classical problem to help give you a physical interpretation to the
</p>
<p>spherical harmonics for problems involving spherical symmetry.

<p>On the other hand, for unbound orbits corresponding to a scattering problem, rmax
approaches infinity. For closed orbits, T21 can be related to the period of the orbit.
</p>
<p>The probability distribution (9.70) must be averaged over all possible classical
</p>
<p>trajectories consistent with Eqs. (9.59)&ndash;(9.61). A simple way to envision this is to
</p>
<p>first imagine the angular momentum in the z-direction. The radial coordinate r is a
</p>
<p>function of .� � �0/, r D r.� � �0/, where � is the azimuthal angle and �0 is a
constant that determines the orientation of the orbit in the x�y plane. I must average
the results over all values of �0 from 0 to 2� . For bound state orbits � � �0 varies
from 0 to 2� , but for unbound orbits � � �0 may vary from some fixed angle ˇ to
2� � ˇ: For example, in the Coulomb problem with positive energy, you can have
</p>
<p>ˇ D cos�1.1=�/; (9.73)
</p>
<p>where � is the eccentricity of the orbit; this value of ˇ corresponds to an asymptote

<p>Spherically Symmetric Potentials: Radial
Equation
</p>
<p>Now that we have studied angular momentum, it is an easy matter to obtain a
</p>
<p>solution of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for spherically symmetric potentials V.r/.
</p>
<p>I will look at bound state solutions of Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation for the infinite
</p>
<p>spherical well potential, the finite spherical well potential, the Coulomb potential
</p>
<p>(hydrogen atom), and the isotropic, 3-D harmonic oscillator potential. Among these,
</p>
<p>the Coulomb potential is undoubtedly the most important, since the solution of the
</p>
<p>Coulomb problem was one of the major triumphs of quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>To help understand the quantum bound state radial probability distributions, it
</p>
<p>will be helpful to compare the quantum results with the classical radial probability
</p>
<p>distributions. For a particle having mass � moving in a potential V.r/, the effective
</p>
<p>potential is
</p>
<p>Veff.r/ D V.r/C L2=
�
2�r2
</p>
<p>�
; (10.1)
</p>
<p>where L is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the particle. For the effective
</p>
<p>potentials that I discuss (see, for example, Fig. 10.1), the bound state classical
</p>
<p>motion is always restricted to a range rmin � r � rmax, where the values of rmin and
rmax are classical radial turning points of the orbits for a given energy and angular
</p>
<p>momentum (for L D 0, the classical orbit is a bounded straight line though the
origin, but rmin D 0 is still a turning point for the radial motion). In this chapter I use
the symbol � for the mass to distinguish it from the magnetic quantum number m&mdash;
</p>
<p>it has the added advantage that in two-body problems such as hydrogen, � actually
</p>
<p>refers to the reduced mass of the electron.
</p>
<p>I define a time T21 as the time it takes for a classical particle having mass � to
</p>
<p>move from rmin to rmax. In the case of the Coulomb and oscillator potentials, the
</p>
<p>bound orbits are closed. The time T21 is half the orbital period in the Coulomb
</p>
<p>problem and one-quarter the orbital period in the oscillator problem. For other

r
; (10.8)
</p>
<p>where Ke is a positive constant. The effective potential is drawn in Fig. 10.1 for
</p>
<p>several angular momenta. Classically, if the particle has negative energy, E &lt; 0, it is
</p>
<p>always bound. For L D 0 the particle orbit passes through the center of force and the
energy can go to �1. For any L &gt; 0, the particle can never go through the origin
and the particle must have a minimum energy Emin that can be obtained by setting
</p>
<p>dVeff .r/ =dr D 0: For L &gt; 0 and Emin � E &lt; 0; the classical orbit is bound between
the two radii rmin;max. At such turning points in the orbit, the radial kinetic energy
</p>
<p>vanishes.
</p>
<p>If the angular momentum is zero, the orbit passes through the origin and all
</p>
<p>the kinetic energy arises from its radial component. At points where the effective
</p>
<p>potential has a minimum, the particle undergoes circular motion and all the kinetic
</p>
<p>energy arises from the angular motion. If we fix the energy in bound state problems,

<p>210 10 Spherically Symmetric Potentials: Radial Equation
</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics there is something analogous to the radial momentum
</p>
<p>defined in Eq. (9.10), allowing us to reduce the quantum problem to an effective
</p>
<p>one-dimensional problem for the radial motion. The effective potential serves as the
</p>
<p>potential for this one-dimensional radial motion. For example, we can expect that
</p>
<p>there may be bound state motion for E &lt; 0 for the Coulomb effective potential
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 10.1. However, for L D 0, we do not expect the minimum energy to
equal �1 and, for any L &curren; 0, we expect that, if there are bound states for a given
L, the minimum energy will be larger than the minimum energy of the classical
</p>
<p>problem. The particle cannot rest at the minimum of the effective potential since
</p>
<p>this would violate the uncertainty principle. As in the classical problem, for a given
</p>
<p>bound state energy, there will be a maximum value of the magnitude of the angular
</p>
<p>momentum that is allowed.

</p>
<p>Using the results of Chap. 9, I have shown that it is a simple matter to reduce all
</p>
<p>central field problems to the solution of a one-dimensional radial equation for
</p>
<p>the radial wave function RE`.r/. Note that the radial wave function has units of
</p>
<p>volume�3=2:
Let&rsquo;s pause for a second and appreciate the importance of Eq. (10.34). We see
</p>
<p>that, for each value of `, there is a radial equation that must be solved for an effective
</p>
<p>potential
</p>
<p>Veff.r/ D V .r/C
&bdquo;2` .`C 1/

</p>
<p>: (10.35)
</p>
<p>That is, for each value of `, we can determine what bound states, if any, are
</p>
<p>present. It is helpful to remember that each value of `, in effect, corresponds
</p>
<p>to a separate problem for a given central force field. You see that the magnetic
</p>
<p>quantum number m of Ym` .�; �/ does not appear in Eq. (10.34). Owing to the
</p>
<p>spherical symmetry of the potential, the energy depends only on the magnitude
</p>
<p>of the angular momentum and not on its direction. In the classical problem, this
</p>
<p>leads to an infinite degeneracy since all directions of L are allowed. In quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics, however, the degeneracy is discrete since, for each value of `, m can
</p>
<p>take on .2`C 1/ values [�`;�`C1; : : : `�1; `]. In other words, owing to spherical
symmetry, the eigenfunctions  E`m.r/ are at least .2`C 1/-fold degenerate for a
given value of E and `.</p>

<p>10.2.1 Boundary Conditions
</p>
<p>As in any problem in quantum mechanics, we must examine the boundary condi-
</p>
<p>tions. It is assumed that V .r/ &gt; E as r ! 1, since the discussion is restricted to
bound states. As such, I expect the radial wave function to fall off exponentially
</p>
<p>as some power of the radius as r ! 1 since r ! 1 corresponds to the
classically forbidden region (a region where the radial contribution to the kinetic
</p>
<p>energy is negative). The exact form of the dependence depends on the nature of the
</p>
<p>potential, but the centrifugal (angular momentum term) potential does not contribute
</p>
<p>as r!1 since it falls off as 1=r2.
As r ! 0, I require that the radial probability density, r2 jR`.r/j2 D ju`.r/j2 ; be
</p>
<p>finite at the origin. Let us first consider ` &curren; 0 and assume the centrifugal potential
term is larger than V.r/ as r ! 0. As r ! 0, the radial equation can then be
approximated as
</p>
<p>d2u`.r/
</p>
<p>dr2
� ` .`C 1/
</p>
<p>r2
u`.r/ D 0; (10.38)
</p>
<p>which has solutions u`.r/ D r�`; r`C1. The r�` solution must be rejected since it
leads to a radial probability density that is not finite at the origin. Thus
</p>
<p>u`.r/ � r`C1 (10.39)
</p>
<p>as r ! 0. This is a general result for any potential that rises or falls less quickly
than 1=r2 as r! 0. The power law dependence in Eq. (10.39) is not surprising; the
larger the angular momentum, the further away from the origin we can expect to find
</p>
<p>the particle. The origin is a classically forbidden region if ` &curren; 0, since a classical
particle having non-zero angular momentum cannot pass through the origin.

<p>10.3 Infinite Spherical Well Potential 215
</p>
<p>For attractive potentials that fall off faster than �1=r2 there is no solution of the
radial equation that satisfies the necessary boundary condition as r ! 0 when
` D 0. In fact, for attractive potentials that fall off faster than �1=r2 as r ! 0,
there is no normalizable solution for any value of `. For attractive potentials that
</p>
<p>fall off more slowly than 1=r2 as r ! 0, it would seem that the requirement that
ju0.r/j2 be finite at the origin would not rule out the possibility that R0.r/ varies
as 1=r; since r2 jR0.r/j2 would then be finite; however,  .r/ �1=r is not a solution
of Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation since, in that limit, the r2 .r/ term in the Hamiltonian
would give rise to a delta function that is not present in the potential. Therefore, as
</p>
<p>r! 0, we must require that
</p>
<p>u0.r/ D rR0.r/ � 0 as r! 0: (10.41)
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, for the potentials that I consider, the radial wave function u`.r/
</p>
<p>satisfies the boundary condition
</p>
<p>u`.r/ D rR`.r/ � r`C1 as r! 0 (10.42)
</p>
<p>for all values of `. In other words, R`.r/ is finite at the origin.
</p>
<p>To summarize, in bound state problem and for ` &curren; 0, there is a classically
forbidden region that extends from r D 0 to rmin, a classically allowed region
between rmin and rmax, and another classically forbidden region for r &gt; rmax (recall
</p>
<p>that rmin and rmax are the turning points of the classical orbits for a given energy).
</p>
<p>For each value of `, the lowest energy state radial wave function will have zero
</p>
<p>nodes in the classically allowed region, the next higher states, one node, etc. We can
</p>
<p>expect the radial wave function to have a polynomial or sinusoidal-like dependence
</p>
<p>in the classically allowed region. In the classically forbidden regions, the radial wave
</p>
<p>function has no nodes and RE`.r/ approaches zero as r ! 0 (for ` &curren; 0) as r` and
as some exponential power of r as r ! 1. Each state having angular momentum
quantum number ` is .2`C 1/ fold degenerate, owing to the spherical symmetry.

</p>
<p>(the ` D 0 curve is along the horizontal axis). For each value of angular momentum, there is
an infinity of discrete energies E possible classically. In the quantum problem, the energies are

</p>
<p>you will see that the minimum energy for a given value of L is larger than that
</p>
<p>predicted by Eq. (10.44). Moreover the allowed energies are quantized rather than
</p>
<p>continuous. Classically, the particle is reflected each time it bounces off the spherical
</p>
<p>potential wall at r D a, but moves with constant velocity between bounces. There
are no simple closed orbits, except for L D 0, when the particle moves along a
diameter.
</p>
<p>To introduce the quantum problem, let me first consider ` D 0: The effective
potential for L D 0 looks similar to that of the one-dimensional infinite square
well potential (except, in the one-dimensional problem, the well width would be 2a,
</p>
<p>going from �a to a), but there is an important difference. In the three-dimensional
problem, even though the potential vanishes at the center of the well, r D 0, there is
a boundary condition that must be satisfied there. The boundary condition at r D 0
is uk;`D0.r/ � uk;0.r/ � r, implying that uk;0.0/ D 0. In other words, solutions
corresponding to even parity solutions of the analogous one-dimensional problem
</p>
<p>(which do not vanish at the center of the well) cannot occur in the three-dimensional
</p>
<p>case. Remember, the radial coordinate is always positive.

<p>With increasing n, the classical distribution for ` D n� 1 corresponds more closely

</p>
<p>correspond to classical elliptical orbits and the electron spends less time when it is

<p>10.7 Summary
</p>
<p>The Schr&ouml;dinger equation for problems with spherical symmetry can be reduced to
</p>
<p>a one-dimensional equation for the radial wave function. I have solved the radial
</p>
<p>equation for a number of problems involving spherically symmetric potentials. It is
</p>
<p>fortuitous that the solution of the spherical well potential, the Coulomb potential,
</p>
<p>and the isotropic oscillator potential can be written in terms of known functions. In
</p>
<p>most cases, it is necessary to solve the radial equation numerically. To help interpret
</p>
<p>the results, I made comparisons of the quantum probability distributions with the
</p>
<p>corresponding classical distributions.

<p>Dirac Notation
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve reached a plateau. You now know how to solve problems in one, two, and
</p>
<p>three dimensions. Hopefully you have the basics under your belt. In this chapter, I
</p>
<p>present a somewhat more general way of specifying the state of a quantum system,
</p>
<p>based on a formalism developed by Dirac.1
</p>
<p>11.1 Vector Spaces and Dirac Notation
</p>
<p>Up to this point, I have focused on methods for obtaining the eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>associated with various Hamiltonians; moreover, the discussion has been limited
</p>
<p>mainly to the coordinate representation. The eigenfunctions form a complete set
</p>
<p>of functions, allowing you to expand any function as a linear superposition of the
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions. This is similar to, but not exactly identical to the situation with
</p>
<p>vectors. As you know you can expand a vector as
</p>
<p>A D Axux C Ayuy C Azuz: (11.1)
</p>
<p>An orthonormal basis set (ux;uy;uz) has been chosen for convenience. You can
</p>
<p>obtain any component of the vector by projection,
</p>
<p>Aj D uj�A; j D x; y; z: (11.2)
</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, on the other hand, an arbitrary function  .r/ can be
</p>
<p>expanded in the set of basis functions corresponding to the eigenfunctions  f .r/
</p>
<p>of some Hermitian operator OF, namely

<p>the scalar product projection operation used for vectors is replaced by integration.
</p>
<p>The analogy with vector spaces can be made exact if we deal with eigenstates
</p>
<p>and state vectors rather than eigenfunctions and wave functions. Dirac developed a
</p>
<p>powerful formalism for representing state vectors in quantum mechanics. Students
</p>
<p>leaving an introductory course in quantum mechanics often can use Dirac notation,
</p>
<p>but may not appreciate its significance.
</p>
<p>11.1.1 Vector Spaces
</p>
<p>It is probably easiest to think of Dirac notation in relation to a three-dimensional
</p>
<p>vector space. Any three dimensional vector can be written as
</p>
<p>A DAxux C Ayuy C Azuz; (11.5)
</p>
<p>where Ax;Ay;Az are the components of the vector in this x; y; z basis. I can represent
</p>
<p>the unit vectors as column vectors,

A : (11.7)
</p>
<p>Of course, the basis vectors ux;uy;uz are not unique; any set of three non-collinear
</p>
<p>unit vectors would do as well. Let&rsquo;s call one such set u1;u2;u3, such that
</p>
<p>A D A1u1 C A2u2 C A3u3: (11.8)
</p>
<p>The vector A is absolute in the sense that it is basis-independent. For a given basis,
</p>
<p>the components of A change in precisely the correct manner to insure that A remains
</p>
<p>unchanged. The example in the problems should make this clear.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.1 Vector Spaces and Dirac Notation 251
</p>
<p>The scalar product of two vectors is defined in the usual fashion as the cosine of
</p>
<p>the angle between the vectors. Although not necessary, it is convenient to choose
</p>
<p>an orthonormal basis, one in which the scalar product of different basis vectors
</p>
<p>vanishes and the scalar product of a basis vector with itself is equal to unity. The
</p>
<p>basis vectors ux;uy;uz constitute an orthogonal basis since
</p>
<p>ux � ux D uy � uy D uz � uz D 1I
ux � uy D uy � uz D ux � uz D 0: (11.9)
</p>
<p>In addition to a geometric interpretation to the scalar product, I can give
</p>
<p>a definition based on matrix multiplication. Even though the vectors are real
</p>
<p>quantities, in preparation for quantum mechanics, I define the adjoint of a vector
</p>
<p>A as

</p>
<p>Next, I define the action of an operator OO on a vector A by the equation
</p>
<p>A0 D OOAI (11.16)
</p>
<p>that is, the operator OO acting on a vector A produces a new vector A0. For example,
the operator OO may result in a translation or a rotation of the vector A. It won&rsquo;t
take you too much effort to realize that a translation doesn&rsquo;t change a vector, but
</p>
<p>a rotation mixes up its components in some specified manner. A linear operator is
</p>
<p>one that produces a new vector having components that are a linear combination of
</p>
<p>the initial components of the vector. In other words, a linear operator OO acting on a
vector A produces a new vector A0 having components
</p>
<p>A0x D OxxAx C OxyAy C OxzAz (11.17a)
A0y D OyxAx C OyyAy C OyzAz (11.17b)
</p>
<p>A0z D OzxAx C OzyAy C OzzAz: (11.17c)
</p>
<p>Equation (11.16) corresponds to what is called an active transformation. The vector
</p>
<p>itself is operated on (e.g., the vector is rotated), but the basis vectors are left
</p>
<p>unchanged. Thus, the new vector is expressed in terms of the original basis as
</p>
<p>A0 D A0xux C A0yuy C A0zuz: (11.18)

<p>It is possible to write Eq. (11.17) as a matrix equation if I define

</p>
<p>that is, I represent a linear operator as a matrix, such that the transformation (11.16)

<p>11.1.2 Hilbert Space
</p>
<p>I can take these ideas over to quantum mechanics. Things will be a little vague and
</p>
<p>confusing at first, but I hope that they clear up as I proceed. I consider only time-
</p>
<p>independent operators and, for the moment, only time-independent state vectors.
</p>
<p>The analogue of the vector A is the state vector jAi, which is an abstract vector
in a Hilbert space that can be finite or infinite-dimensional. Such a state vector is
</p>
<p>referred to as a ket. As in a normal vector space, I can introduce unit vectors or basis
</p>
<p>kets jni. Thus, the ket jni can be thought of as a column matrix having a 1 in the nth
place and a zero everywhere else. The state vector can be expanded as
</p>
<p>jAi D
X
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>An jni : (11.26)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>254 11 Dirac Notation
</p>
<p>In other words, the state vector jAi is a column matrix whose nth element is An.
As in the vector case, the state vector jAi has an absolute meaning. If I change the
basis kets, I change the coordinates An but do not change jAi. The adjoint of a ket is
called a bra and can be represented by a row matrix. The adjoint of the basis ket jni
is written as
</p>
<p>hnj D .jni/&#142; (11.27)
</p>
<p>If the basis kets are orthonormal, as is often the case, then
</p>
<p>hn jmi D ım;n: (11.28)
</p>
<p>You can see the origin of the bra-ket (bracket) notation. Unless stated otherwise,
</p>
<p>I will assume that the basis kets are orthonormal. The adjoint of Eq. (11.26) is
</p>
<p>defined by

<p>where
</p>
<p>Omn D hmj OO jni (11.37)
</p>
<p>is a matrix element of the operator OO in the jni basis. Linear operators can be
represented as matrices, just as in three-dimensional vector space. It is convenient
</p>
<p>to define unit matrices by

<p>m

</p>
<p>Remember that jni hqj is a matrix with a one for the nq element and zeroes
everywhere else. The matrix O
</p>
<p>&macr;
is Hermitian if Onm D .Omn/�.
</p>
<p>I now come to the fundamental difference between a vector space and Hilbert
</p>
<p>space, as applied to quantum mechanics. In three-dimensional vector space, in
</p>
<p>general, one chooses the basis vectors without making any reference to the operators
</p>
<p>acting in the space. In quantum mechanics, a central feature is to choose a set of
</p>
<p>basis vectors that is intimately connected with operators acting in the Hilbert space.
</p>
<p>Moreover, it is assumed that the Hermitian operator associated with each physical
</p>
<p>observable has a matrix representation that is diagonal in its own basis.
</p>
<p>That is, in a given basis jhi associated with a Hermitian operator OH, it is assumed
that H
</p>
<p>&macr;
is diagonal,

</p>
<p>which is just an eigenvalue equation for OH! Consequently, we can use all the results
that were derived in connection with the eigenvalue problem (eigenkets exist, are
</p>
<p>complete, can be chosen to form an orthonormal basis, simultaneous eigenkets can
</p>
<p>always be chosen for commuting operators, etc.). The eigenvalues h are the only
</p>
<p>possible outcomes of a measurement of the physical observable associated with OH
when made on a single quantum system.
</p>
<p>I define the time-dependent state vector j .t/i to be the solution of the time-
dependent Schr&ouml;dinger equation,
</p>
<p>i&bdquo;d j .t/i
dt
</p>
<p>D OH j .t/i : (11.42)
</p>
<p>It is a simple matter to show that the solution of this equation can be written in the

</p>
<p>Thus, if we solve Eq. (11.44), we have a complete solution to any problem for a
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian OH.
Since I have assumed that an operator is diagonal in its own basis, it follows that
</p>
<p>OH jEi D E jEi I (11.45a)
Or jri D r jri I (11.45b)
Op jpi D p jpi : (11.45c)

<p>Furthermore, any operator corresponding to a classical variable that is a function
</p>
<p>only of r has jri as its eigenkets and any operator corresponding to a classical
variable that is a function only of p has jpi as its eigenkets; that is, for operators
OV and Op2, the matrices V

</p>
<p>All this is well and good, but what have I accomplished? Normally in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics we want to find the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian, now expressed as
</p>
<p>the matrix H
&macr;
: In the jEi basis, H
</p>
<p>&macr;
is simply a diagonal matrix whose elements are
</p>
<p>the eigenenergies, but we have no way of calculating them yet. In other words, if
</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know the eigenenergies, the equation OH jEi D E jEi doesn&rsquo;t help us to
find them. It may be that we know the matrix elements of H
</p>
<p>&macr;
in some other basis,
</p>
<p>however. If that were the case, it turns out that if we diagonalize the matrix H
&macr;
</p>
<p>, we
</p>
<p>can find the eigenenergies of OH, as well as the eigenkets of OH in terms of the basis
kets for which we know the matrix elements of H
</p>
<p>&macr;
.
</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. Say that the Hamiltonian is that of a free particle,
</p>
<p>H
&macr;
D
</p>
<p>p
&macr;
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>2m
: (11.47)
</p>
<p>Since H
&macr;
</p>
<p>is diagonal in the jpi basis, the jpi states are the eigenkets of H
&macr;
</p>
<p>and the
</p>
<p>corresponding eigenenergies are p2=2m: But what if the Hamiltonian is of the form
</p>
<p>H
&macr;
D
</p>
<p>p
&macr;
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>2m
C V
</p>
<p>&macr;
; (11.48)
</p>
<p>where V
&macr;
</p>
<p>is the matrix corresponding to the potential energy operator OV . I know the
matrix elements of Op2 in the jpi basis and those of OV in the jri basis, but not those
of the entire Hamiltonian in any one basis.
</p>
<p>To proceed further, I need to inject some quantum physics. Previously, one of
</p>
<p>the postulates I used was to assume that the wave functions in coordinate and
</p>
<p>momentum space were Fourier transforms of one another. This allowed me to
</p>
<p>calculate the momentum operator in coordinate space. I now replace this postulate
</p>
<p>by one in which the Poisson bracket of classical mechanics for two variables is
</p>
<p>replaced by the commutator of the matrices in quantum mechanics corresponding to
</p>
<p>those variables, multiplied by .i&bdquo;/�1. The Poisson bracket of two arbitrary functions
F and G with respect to canonical variables q and p is defined as
</p>
<p>ŒF;G&#141;q;p D

<p>@p

<p>As a consequence, the Poisson bracket of x and px is

</p>
<p>To arrive at the analogous equation for quantum mechanics, I replace Œx; px&#141;x;px by
</p>
<p>.i&bdquo;/�1 ŒOx; Opx&#141; to arrive at the commutator relation ŒOx; Opx&#141; D i&bdquo;: This will allow me to
evaluate matrix elements of Op in the jri basis.</p>

<p>It is clear that Opx is not diagonal in the jxi basis since the derivative of a delta function
is not proportional to ı.x�x0/; that is, it is non-zero for values of x &curren; x0. You can
understand this easily. A delta function ı.x/ is like a narrow Gaussian centered at
</p>
<p>x D 0 whose derivative vanishes at x D 0, has a sharp maximum for x &lt; 0, and a
sharp minimum for x &gt; 0&mdash;it is non-zero for values of x &curren; 0: Of course we knew
beforehand that Op could not be diagonal in the jri basis since two operators can have
simultaneous eigenkets if and only if the operators commute.
</p>
<p>I have made some progress. Using the assumed commutation relation between
</p>
<p>Ox and Opx, I found a matrix representation of Op in the jri basis. The matrix is
not diagonal, nor will the matrix p
</p>
<p>&macr;
</p>
<p>2 be diagonal. As a consequence, to get the
</p>
<p>eigenvalues of H
&macr;
</p>

<p>Diagonalizing H

<p>in the jri basis is equivalent to solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation! I

<p>Schr&ouml;dinger equation. Nevertheless Dirac notation provides a powerful formalism
</p>
<p>that lets us express results in a basis-independent fashion.
</p>
<p>Often, I will need to calculate the matrix elements of an operator OA in the energy
basis, namely hEj OA jE0i. Suppose that the operator OA corresponds to a physical
variable A.r/ that is a function of coordinates only&mdash; OA is diagonal in the jri basis.</p>

<p>The energy eigenfunctions in coordinate and momentum space are Fourier trans-

<p>commutation relations for the position and momentum operators. Here I postulated
</p>
<p>the commutation relations and was led to the result that E.r/ andˆE.p/ are Fourier
</p>

</p>
<p>Although I have shown that diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in the coordinate
</p>
<p>representation is equivalent to solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, there are some
</p>
<p>cases where it is possible to get the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions working directly
</p>
<p>from the Dirac notation formalism. I now turn my attention to two such cases, the
</p>
<p>simple harmonic oscillator and the angular momentum operator.

</p>
<p>It turns out, by being a bit clever, you can find the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>of the SHO without solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation. For reasons that will become
</p>
<p>obvious, the operators a and a&#142; are often referred to as ladder operators and On as the
number operator.
</p>
<p>To start, I label the eigenkets of On by jni without any restriction on n (it need not
be an integer) such that
</p>
<p>OH0 jni D

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.2 Simple Harmonic Oscillator 265
</p>
<p>This is perfectly arbitrary since there is no restriction on n.
</p>
<p>The operator a is a lowering or destruction operator, which can be proved as
</p>
<p>follows: First I note that
</p>
<p>OH0 .a jni/ D OH0a jni D
�h
OH0; a
</p>

</p>
<p>implying that

<p>�
jni D Œ�aC a .nC 1=2/&#141; jni
</p>
<p>D Œ.n � 1/C 1=2&#141; .a jni/ : (11.101)
</p>
<p>In other words, .a jni/ is an eigenket of OH0 having eigenvalue n � 1.
By successively applying the operator a, I keep lowering the eigenvalue by one.
</p>
<p>However, the expectation value of the number operator is always positive or zero,
</p>
<p>since
</p>
<p>hnj On jni D hnj a&#142;a jni D .a jni/&#142; .a jni/ � 0: (11.102)
</p>
<p>Thus as I keep applying the operator a, I must come to a lowest state jnmini for
which a jnmini D 0: As a consequence,
</p>
<p>a&#142; .a jnmini/ D 0 D On jnmini D nmin jnmini ; (11.103)
</p>
<p>which requires that nmin D 0: The value of nmin D 0 was reached by continually
lowering n by one; therefore, n must be a positive integer or zero and the
</p>
<p>(dimensionless) eigenenergies are
</p>
<p>�n D .nC 1=2/; n D 0; 1; 2; 3; : : : : (11.104)
</p>
<p>I have obtained the eigenenergies without having solved Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation.
</p>
<p>Since .a jni/ is an eigenket of OH having eigenvalue n � 1; I can write
</p>
<p>a jni D cn jn � 1i ; (11.105)
</p>
<p>where cn is a constant. Thus
</p>
<p>n D hnj a&#142;a jni D .a jni/&#142; .a jni/ D .cn jn � 1i/&#142; .cn jn � 1i/

</p>
<p>11.3 Angular Momentum Operator
</p>
<p>Angular momentum can also be analyzed using ladder operators. I designate the

<p>OL2 j&#13;ˇi D &bdquo;2&#13; j&#13;ˇi (11.135a)
OLz j&#13;ˇi D &bdquo;ˇ j&#13;ˇi : (11.135b)
</p>
<p>At this point, &#13; and ˇ are totally arbitrary. Given that OL is Hermitian, OL2 D OL&#142; � OL
must have non-negative eigenvalues; &#13; � 0: Moreover, since the expectation value
of OL2x C OL2y in any state must also be non-negative, it follows that

</p>
<p>does not change its shape. That result was proved in Chap. 7. However, you can prove that all
</p>
<p>moments of the coordinate for the oscillator are constant, which is equivalent to proving the wave
</p>
<p>packet does not change its shape.</p>

</p>
<p>This is not a surprising result&mdash;we expect the z-component of angular momentum
</p>
<p>to be less than or equal to the magnitude of the angular momentum.
</p>
<p>I now form ladder operators
</p>
<p>OL˙ D OLx ˙ i OLy: (11.138)
</p>
<p>The fact that these are ladder operators follows from the commutation relations

<p>In other words, OL˙ j&#13;ˇi is an eigenket of OLz having eigenvalue &bdquo; .ˇ ˙ 1/, namely
</p>
<p>OL˙ j&#13;ˇi D &bdquo;C˙ .&#13;; ˇ/ j&#13;; ˇ ˙ 1i ; (11.142)
</p>
<p>where C˙ .&#13;; ˇ/ is a constant.
Thus, by applying OL˙ to j&#13;ˇi successively, I keep raising or lowering the

<p>From Eqs. (11.150) and (11.144) you see that &#13; D ` .`C 1/, where ` D ˇmax is a
positive half-integer, integer, or zero, and ˇ, which I now denote by m; can take on

of the operators OL2 and OLz without solving a differential equation.

<p>11.4 Solving Problems Using Dirac Notation
</p>
<p>Things have been a bit formal in discussing Dirac notation, so let me summarize
</p>
<p>where and when you use it in practical situations relative to the Schr&ouml;dinger
</p>
<p>equation. In general, you can often solve problems involving a discrete subspace
</p>
<p>using Dirac notation, but need the Schr&ouml;dinger equation to solve problems involving
</p>
<p>an infinite number of levels. I give a few examples below to help illustrate these
</p>
<p>points.
</p>
<p>11.4.1 Hydrogen Atom
</p>
<p>I have already solved Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation for the hydrogen atom potential and
</p>
<p>found that, if E &lt; 0; there is an infinite number of bound states. I also obtained the
</p>
<p>wave functions associated with these bound states. For E &gt; 0, there is an infinite
</p>
<p>number of continuum states along with their associated eigenfunctions.
</p>
<p>If you try to solve this problem using Dirac notation, you start from
</p>
<p>OH jEi D E jEi ; (11.164)
</p>
<p>but this is useless for obtaining the eigenvalues since you don&rsquo;t already know them!
</p>
<p>To proceed, you expand
</p>
<p>jEi D
Z
</p>
<p>dr hr jEi jri (11.165)
</p>
<p>and try to find the expansion coefficients hr jEi. I have already shown that these
expansion coefficients satisfy the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, so there is no advantage in
</p>
<p>using Dirac notation to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hydrogen
</p>
<p>atom. On the other hand, you can label the eigenkets of the hydrogen atom by the
</p>
<p>eigenvalues of the commuting operators OH; OL2; OLz, namely jn; `;mi, where n; `;m
are the quantum numbers corresponding to these physical quantities.
</p>
<p>11.4.2 Harmonic Oscillator
</p>
<p>This is a mixed case. You can solve for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues
</p>
<p>using the Schr&ouml;dinger equation without much trouble. However, as we have seen,
</p>
<p>it is also possible to introduce ladder operators and solve for the eigenvalues
</p>
<p>and eigenfunctions without having ever solved the Schr&ouml;dinger equation directly.
</p>
<p>Calculation of matrix elements is easiest using the ladder operators. Although not
</p>
<p>so obvious, it is also possible to solve for the eigenvalues of the hydrogen atom</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.4 Solving Problems Using Dirac Notation 275
</p>
<p>without solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation based on the group O.4/ and the fact that
</p>
<p>both angular momentum and the Lenz vector are conserved.4
</p>
<p>11.4.3 Angular Momentum
</p>
<p>I will discuss formal aspects of angular momentum in Chaps. 19&ndash;20. Dirac notation
</p>
<p>is the preferred notation for dealing with angular momentum since you can label
</p>
<p>the simultaneous eigenkets of OL2 and OLz by j`m`i and write matrices for both L2
and OLz. For a given integral value of `, each of these diagonal matrices has dimension
.2`C 1/ � .2`C 1/:
</p>
<p>To illustrate the power of Dirac notation, I would like to discuss the eigenkets of
OL2 and either OLx and OLz. I represent the eigenkets of OL2 and OLx by j`; `xi and those of
OL2 and OLz by j`; `zi. Clearly the eigenvalues must be identical, since there is nothing
physically that can distinguish OLx from OLz. I can take the basis kets (a column vector
with a 1 in one place and zeroes everywhere else) to be those of OLx or OLz, but not
both. For example, let me take the basis kets to be j`; `zi and take ` D 1. In this

</p>
<p>The difference between OLx and OLz becomes apparent when I consider the
eigenfunctions rather than the eigenkets. The reason for this is that the spherical
</p>
<p>coordinate system is one in which the polar angle is measured from the z axis,
</p>
<p>making the eigenfunctions of OLz simpler than those of OLx. If I take the inner product

with OLx given by Eq. (9.31a) would be more difficult.

<p>11.6 Summary
</p>
<p>I have shown that Dirac notation is a powerful method for dealing with problems in
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics. Rather than specify a given representation, you can write state
</p>
<p>vectors in a basis-independent manner. Connection with specific representations
</p>
<p>such as the coordinate or momentum representation can then be obtained by taking
</p>
<p>inner products. In Dirac notation, operators are represented by matrices. As such
</p>
<p>Dirac notation is closely related to Heisenberg&rsquo;s matrix formulation of quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics.
</p>
<p>11.7 Appendix A: Matrix Properties
</p>
<p>In this Appendix, I list some matrix properties. I simply use standard type for all
</p>
<p>matrices, rather than underlined quantities. The identity matrix I has Iij D ıi;j, that
is, ones along the diagonal and zeroes everywhere else. The inverse A�1 of a matrix

<p>to say that the matrix elements of an operator depend on the basis? Give an
</p>
<p>example by considering the matrix elements of the operator Ox in the coordinate and
momentum bases. Is it diagonal in the coordinate basis? in the momentum basis?

<p>(e.g., Orthogonalize[Eigenvectors[{{3.,1},{1,2}}]]&mdash;putting the decimal point in
</p>
<p>will give you numerical values).

<p>Spin
</p>
<p>12.1 Classical Magnetic Moment
</p>
<p>I have completed most of the material typically covered in a one-semester course
</p>
<p>on quantum mechanics. There is one additional topic, however, that needs to be
</p>
<p>discussed, that of intrinsic angular momentum or spin. Spin arises naturally when
</p>
<p>one considers the relativistic version of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, namely the Dirac
</p>
<p>equation. In that equation the wave function for a free electron has four components,
</p>
<p>two of which correspond to positive energy solutions. The two positive energy
</p>
<p>solutions can be associated with two spin components of the electron (the negative
</p>
<p>energy solutions correspond to anti-particles). Historically, spin was deduced from
</p>
<p>atomic spectra. In turned out that the spectra could be explained if one assigned an
</p>
<p>intrinsic angular momentum to the electron. Today we know that all elementary
</p>
<p>particles possess such an intrinsic angular momentum (which can be zero for
</p>
<p>some particles). Fermions (named after Enrico Fermi) are particles whose intrinsic
</p>
<p>angular momentum quantum number corresponds to half integral values of intrinsic
</p>
<p>spin (measured in units of &bdquo;) while bosons (named after Satyendra Nath Bose)
are particles whose intrinsic angular momentum quantum number corresponds to
</p>
<p>integral values of intrinsic spin.
</p>
<p>Before discussing spin, it is useful to recall the relationship between the magnetic
</p>
<p>moment of a charged particle and its angular momentum relative to some origin. The
</p>
<p>magnetic moment of an electron circulating about the origin is given by

<p>The other experiment is the Stern-Gerlach experiment carried out in 1921 (see

a magnetic moment owing to the motion of its electrons about the nucleus. The

<p>Classically, we would expect a beam of particles having a magnetic moment �
</p>
<p>oriented in random directions to be deflected over a continuous range in the z-
</p>
<p>direction corresponding to the range of values �� � �z � � in the incoming
beam.
</p>
<p>In the quantum case, �z is replaced by the expectation value of the z-component
</p>
<p>of the magnetic moment operator which, in turn, is proportional to the expectation
</p>
<p>value of OLz. Thus, owing to the gradient force, atoms having an angular momentum
quantum number ` should be split into .2`C 1/ discrete paths after passing through
the magnetic field region, each path corresponding to a different value of the z-
</p>
<p>component of angular momentum or magnetic moment. It was found, however, that
</p>
<p>when silver atoms were sent through the apparatus, two paths were detected even
</p>
<p>though ground state silver atoms were known to have ` D 0.
Compton and Pauli had previously suggested that the electron could possess
</p>
<p>an intrinsic magnetic moment, but the credit for the explanation usually goes
</p>
<p>to Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck (although they never won the Nobel prize for the
</p>
<p>discovery of spin). To fit the experimental data, the operator O�s associated with
intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron and the operator OS associated with the
intrinsic spin angular momentum of the electron must be related by
</p>
<p>�s D �ge
eS
</p>
<p>2me
I (12.9)
</p>
<p>moreover, it is necessary that the spin operator OS appearing in Eq. (12.9) corresponds
to an angular momentum quantum number s D 1=2. The quantity ge appearing
in Eq. (12.9) is referred to as the electron g-factor. To fit the spectroscopic data,
</p>
<p>Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck took ge D 2. It turns out that ge is approximately equal to
2, but there are corrections related to the interaction of the electron with the vacuum
</p>
<p>field. The electron g-factor is one of the most precisely determined constants in
</p>
<p>physics with
</p>
<p>ge D 2:0023193043622˙ 0:0000000000015; (12.10)
</p>
<p>and is in agreement with theoretical calculations. I will take ge D 2.
It is natural to talk about spin using Dirac notation. The spin state of an electron
</p>
<p>can be described by the eigenket jsmsi where s D 1=2, ms D ˙1=2. The state with
ms D C1=2 is referred to as spin up and that with ms D �1=2 as spin down. As for

<p>(the s quantum number is suppressed in most of these equations since it always

<p>and has nothing to do with motion of charge&mdash;any classical models based on a

<p>rotating charge give meaningless results. Thus, spin acts in its own abstract space,

<p>out spin up relative to some quantization axis. We now pass these atoms through a</p>

<p>12.2 Spin Magnetic Moment 297
</p>
<p>second Stern-Gerlach magnet that is oriented at an angle � � � relative to the first
(that is, the spin is now defined relative to a new axis that is at an angle � relative to
</p>
<p>the first). The question is, &ldquo;What is the spin state after passing through the second
</p>
<p>magnet?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Before answering this question let us think about what happens in a similar
</p>
<p>situation with the electric field vector of light, which is a vector quantity. After
</p>
<p>passing through a polarizer whose axis is in the z direction (the light is propagating
</p>
<p>in the y direction/ and an analyzer in the x � z plane whose axis is at an angle
� � � relative to the z-axis; the field intensity after passing through the analyzer is
proportional to cos2 � . That is, if the analyzer is rotated by � relative to the polarizer,
</p>
<p>the intensity is unchanged. If the analyzer is rotated by �=2 (crossed polarizers), no
</p>
<p>light gets through.
</p>
<p>But what happens with spin? In the spin experiment, the first magnet has B D
B0uz and the second
</p>
<p>B D B0 .uz cos � C ux sin �/ : (12.21)
</p>
<p>To see what occurs, I must express the original state vector in terms of the new state
</p>
<p>vectors defined relative to the new direction of the field. In other words, I need to
</p>
<p>look at the interaction of the spin magnetic moment with the new field,

</p>
<p>Thus the probability to find the atom in spin up after the second magnet is cos2 .�=2/
</p>
<p>instead of being proportional to cos2 � as I found for the electric field case. It
</p>
<p>takes a rotation of � to block the passage of the spin up component emerging
</p>
<p>from the second magnet [only a spin down component (with respect to the new</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>298 12 Spin
</p>
<p>quantization axis) is transmitted], whereas it takes a rotation of �=2 to (totally)
</p>
<p>block the emerging optical field. It is not difficult to understand why a rotation of �
</p>
<p>leads to no transmission of a spin up component&mdash;when it enters the second magnet,
</p>
<p>there is no longer any spin up component with respect to the new quantization axis.
</p>
<p>In order to see the effect of rotation on the spin state vector from a somewhat
</p>
<p>different perspective, imagine an electron having its magnetic moment aligned
</p>
<p>along a strong homogeneous magnetic field, taken to be in the z-direction. Now
</p>
<p>slowly rotate the magnetic field about the y-axis. For sufficiently slow rotations,
</p>
<p>the magnetic moment will stay aligned with the field. As a consequence, after a
</p>
<p>rotation of � the spin has been flipped from down to up (recall that spin angular
</p>
<p>momentum and magnetic moment differ in sign for an electron) relative to the
</p>
<p>original quantization axis. After a rotation of 2� , the magnetic moment is again
</p>
<p>aligned along the positive z-direction, but the sign of the spin state vector has
</p>
<p>changed [see Eq. (12.25) with � D 2�]. It takes a rotation of 4� to return the state
vector to its original value. The state vector is said to transform as a spinor under
</p>
<p>rotation. Rotations are discussed in more detail in Chaps. 19 and 20.
</p>
<p>12.3 Spin-Orbit Coupling in Hydrogen
</p>
<p>If we put ourselves in the rest frame of the electron in a hydrogen atom, we would
</p>
<p>see the proton undergoing orbital motion. This orbital motion produces a magnetic
</p>
<p>field at the position of the electron. Since the electron has a magnetic moment, there
</p>
<p>is spin&ndash;orbit interaction in hydrogen that adds a term to the Hamiltonian that is
</p>
<p>given classically by
</p>
<p>Hso D �� � Bproton: (12.26)
</p>
<p>There are two ways to evaluate Hso that both give the same (wrong) answer. First we

<p>Both methods give a result which is twice the correct result. There is a correction,
</p>
<p>known as the Thomas Precession,3 connected with the fact that the electron is in an
</p>
<p>accelerating reference frame. Why the correction factor is exactly one/half remains
</p>
<p>somewhat of a mystery to me.4 In any event the correct spin&ndash;orbit interaction is

<p>As I have mentioned, the correct spin-orbit coupling emerges naturally in Dirac&rsquo;s

<p>relativistic treatment of the bound states of hydrogen. In Chap. 21, I use perturbation

<p>theory within the framework of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation to calculate the changes

<p>which are eigenkets of OL2; OLz; OS2; OSz. For an isolated atom, however, it turns out that
OLz and OSz need not be constants of the motion when the spin-orbit interaction given

<p>is a constant of the motion. As a result, it is often convenient to use eigenkets of the

` D 4 is G, etc., and J is the j value. Thus 2P3=2 is the state having n D 2, ` D 1,
and j D 3=2.
</p>
<p>12.5 Spin and Statistics
</p>
<p>Most of the discussion to date has focused on the quantum mechanics of a single
</p>
<p>particle. I did look at the eigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian that was the sum of two
</p>
<p>commuting Hamiltonians in Chap. 5. That result is strictly valid only if the particles
</p>
<p>governed by each of the Hamiltonians are distinguishable. But what happens if they
</p>
<p>are indistinguishable, such as the two electrons in the helium atom?
</p>
<p>The eigenfunctions of a two-particle system can be written as  E .r1; r2/ where
</p>
<p>rj is the coordinate of particle j. If the particles are indistinguishable, there is an
</p>
<p>exchange degeneracy in this system. I can define an operator that interchanges
</p>
<p>the coordinates of the two particles. This exchange or permutation operator is
</p>
<p>Hermitian and commutes with the Hamiltonian so it is possible to find simultaneous
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian and the permutation operator. Let me denote the
</p>
<p>exchange or permutation operator that interchanges particle 1 and 2 by OP12 and its
eigenfunctions by  E;P .r1; r2/ : Clearly
</p>
<p>OP212 E;P .r1; r2/ D  E;P .r1; r2/ (12.41)
</p>
<p>and, since OP12 is Hermitian, this implies that the eigenvalues of OP12 must equal ˙1.
This, in turn, implies that either
</p>
<p> E;P .r2; r1/ D  E;P .r1; r2/ (12.42)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>302 12 Spin
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p> E;P .r2; r1/ D � E;P .r1; r2/ : (12.43)
</p>
<p>It turns out that the wave functions of all elementary particles satisfy either
</p>
<p>Eq. (12.42) or (12.43). Particles having integral intrinsic spin that satisfy Eq. (12.42)
</p>
<p>and are called bosons (photon, graviton, mesons) while particles having half-integral
</p>
<p>intrinsic spin satisfy Eq. (12.43) and are called fermions (electron, neutrino, quarks,
</p>
<p>baryons).
</p>
<p>For multi-particle systems, the eigenfunctions for bosons must be symmetric on
</p>
<p>the interchange of any two particles and that for fermions must be antisymmetric
</p>
<p>on the interchange of any two particles. In practice you can show that you need not
</p>
<p>worry about this symmetrization of the wave function if the spatial wave functions
</p>
<p>for the particles never overlap.
</p>
<p>For two spin 1/2 particles moving in a potential, it is always possible to write the
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions as a product of a symmetric (antisymmetric) spatial wave function
</p>
<p>multiplied by an antisymmetric (symmetric) spin state. The spin eigenkets of the two
</p>
<p>particles are eigenkets of the total spin operator, OS D OS1C OS2; and can be expressed
in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients as
</p>
<p>js1; s2; I s;mi D
X
</p>
<p>m1;m2

<p>�
s1 s2 s
</p>
<p>m1 m2 m
</p>
<p>�
js1m1i js2m2i ; (12.44)
</p>
<p>where the ket js1; s2; I s;mi is a simultaneous eigenket of the operators OS21; OS22; OS2; OSz.
Using this equation with s1 D s2 D 1=2; I find that the coupled spin eigenkets of
two electrons consist of an antisymmetric or spin singlet state

<p>2, it is no longer possible to construct total spin eigenkets all of which are

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.5 Spin and Statistics 303
</p>
<p>antisymmetric spin state for N &gt; 2. Of the 2N total spin eigenkets, only .N C 1/ are
totally symmetric on the interchange of any two particles and these correspond the
</p>
<p>the spin state having total spin s D N=2.
There is a profound difference in the allowed energy levels of a system of
</p>
<p>indistinguishable particles, depending on whether the particles are fermions or
</p>
<p>bosons. A simple example will suffice to illustrate this idea. Imagine we have
</p>
<p>three non-interacting particles in a one-dimensional infinite square well potential.
</p>
<p>You are asked to obtain the ground state energy and eigenfunction of the system
</p>
<p>assuming (1) the particles are bosons and (2) the particles are spin 1=2 fermions.
</p>
<p>If the particles are bosons they can all be in the same energy state so the ground
</p>
<p>state energy is simply 3E0, where E0 is the ground state energy of a single particle
</p>
<p>in the well. The ground state wave function is simply a product of the ground state
</p>
<p>wave functions for each particle, multiplied by a symmetric state of the spins of the
</p>
<p>particles.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the particles are spin 1/2 fermions, they cannot all have
</p>
<p>the same ground state spatial wave function. Such a wave function is symmetric on
</p>
<p>exchange of any two particles, which would require that the spin wave function be
</p>
<p>antisymmetric on the exchange of any two particles. It is impossible to form such a
</p>
<p>state for three particles that is non-vanishing. Thus the third particle must be in the
</p>
<p>first excited state of the well having energy E1. The total energy of this 3-particle
</p>
<p>system is E D 2E0 C E1, while the wave function is

</p>
<p>As a second example of the role of spin and statistics, consider a conductor that
</p>
<p>is modeled as a sea of free electrons confined to a volume. If I take the volume to be

<p>12.6 Summary
</p>
<p>The concept of electron spin was introduced. The electron possesses an intrinsic
</p>
<p>angular momentum corresponding to a spin angular momentum quantum number
</p>
<p>s D 1=2. Some of the properties of spin were discussed, as were the modifications
to the energy levels of hydrogen resulting from spin. Finally, systems of identical
</p>
<p>particles were considered and were found to obey either Bose or Fermi statistics,
</p>
<p>depending on their intrinsic spin angular momentum. No two identical fermions can
</p>
<p>possess all the same quantum labels since their wave function must be antisymmetric
</p>
<p>on exchange of particles. The fact that no two electrons can possess all the same
</p>
<p>quantum numbers is often referred to as the Pauli Exclusion Principle, based on a
</p>
<p>proposal of Pauli to explain the shell structure of atoms.

<p>5. The fifth postulate can take different forms. One way to state the postulate is
</p>
<p>that the Poisson brackets of two dynamic variables of classical mechanics are
</p>
<p>replaced by the .i&bdquo;/�1 times the commutator of the corresponding Hermitian
operators in quantum mechanics, the postulate I used when discussing Dirac
</p>
<p>notation. An alternative and equivalent postulate is that the Fourier transform
</p>
<p>of  .r; t/, denoted by ˆ.p; t/, corresponds to the wave function in momentum
</p>
<p>space, the postulate I used in the wave function approach.

<p>13.1.4 Eigenfunctions and Eigenenergies
</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that each potential energy function gives rise to its own
</p>
<p>set of eigenfunctions. Thus, the eigenfunctions of a free particle are infinite, plane
</p>
<p>mono-energetic waves, while those of any bound state problem are localized in
</p>
<p>space. But what about the unbound state eigenfunctions of the hydrogen atom? They
</p>
<p>are not localized states, nor are they plane wave states. Instead they must be found by
</p>
<p>solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for positive energies. Similarly, for the problem of</p>

</p>
<p>a one-dimensional well and particle energies E &gt; 0, the solutions of Shcr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>equation are sines and cosines in each region, but the eigenfunction is not a single
</p>
<p>plane wave state. In three-dimensional problems with spherical symmetry, there is
</p>
<p>a separate effective potential problem to solve for each value of `.
</p>
<p>13.1.5 Operators

</p>
<p>associated with OA is a constant of the motion. For an operator that doesn&rsquo;t commute
with the Hamiltonian, its expectation value is not constant, in general.

<p>The expectation values obey the laws of classical physics. This is known as

</p>
<p>13.1.5.1 Commuting Operators: Simultaneous Eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>Two Hermitian operators possess simultaneous eigenfunctions if and only if they
</p>
<p>commute. Moreover, any operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian is a constant
</p>
<p>of the motion. Constants of the motion can be used to label eigenfunctions of the
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian. In general, whenever there is a dynamic constant of the motion such</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.1 Review of Basic Concepts 315
</p>
<p>as momentum or angular momentum, there is an energy degeneracy associated with
</p>
<p>that conserved quantity. In that case the eigenvalues of the conserved operators can
</p>
<p>be used to label different eigenfunctions that have the same energy. For example,
</p>
<p>for the free particle, there is infinite degeneracy for any non zero energy since the
</p>
<p>direction of the momentum can be in any direction. However, by using simultaneous
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of both the energy and momentum (momentum is conserved),
</p>
<p>you can uniquely label each energy eigenfunction. Similarly, in problems with
</p>
<p>spherical symmetry, angular momentum is conserved and you can label states by the
</p>
<p>eigenvalues associated with the commuting operators OL2, OLz, and OH. There is always
a .2`C 1/ energy degeneracy associated with each state of a given `. In general,
the energy in problems with spherical symmetry depends on both the ` quantum
</p>
<p>number and some additional quantum number&mdash;only in problems with some extra
</p>
<p>symmetry such as hydrogen and the 3-d harmonic oscillator does the energy depend
</p>
<p>only on a single quantum number n: For example, in an infinite spherical potential
</p>
<p>well, for each `; there is a set of possible energies for each ` that can be labeled by
</p>
<p>the zeroes of the spherical Bessel functions. In that case, the energy is determined
</p>
<p>by both ` and a quantum number n for which j`.kna/ D 0, where n D 1; 2; 3; : : :
labels the zeroes of the Bessel function.
</p>
<p>13.1.6 Measurement in Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>What truly sets quantum mechanics apart from classical physics is the existence of
</p>
<p>a single quantum system. There is no classical analogue of a single quantum system
</p>
<p>in a superposition state. In contrast to a closed classical system of particles and
</p>
<p>fields for which the energy is constant, it is impossible to assign a unique energy
</p>
<p>to a single quantum system that is in a superposition state of two or more energies.
</p>
<p>A measurement of the energy will yield one of the energies in the superposition
</p>
<p>state, but we don&rsquo;t know which one. If you measure the dynamic variable associated
</p>
<p>with a Hermitian operator for any single quantum system in a superposition state
</p>
<p>of eigenfunctions of that operator, you get one and only one eigenvalue of that
</p>
<p>operator. Large numbers of measurements on identically prepared quantum systems
</p>
<p>are needed to map out the probability function for each of the eigenvalues.
</p>
<p>13.1.7 Dirac Notation
</p>
<p>Although the wave function usually gives us some information about the spa-
</p>
<p>tial probability distribution, it is possible to formulate quantum mechanics in a
</p>
<p>somewhat more abstract formalism using Dirac notation. In Dirac notation each
</p>
<p>Hermitian operator has its own set of eigenkets. These kets can be represented as
</p>
<p>column vectors with a 1 in one position and zeroes everywhere else. Each operator
</p>
<p>is diagonal in its own basis with the diagonal elements simply the eigenvalues of the</p>
<p/>

<p>316 13 (A) Review (B) Feynman Path-Integral Approach (C) Bell&rsquo;s Theorem
</p>
<p>operator. In some cases, as for the harmonic oscillator or for angular momentum, it
</p>
<p>is possible to define ladder operators and obtain the eigenenergies without solving
</p>
<p>Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation. However in most cases, this is impossible and one reverts to
</p>
<p>solving eigenvalue equations using the wave function formalism. The real import of
</p>
<p>Dirac notation is that different representations, such as momentum and coordinate,
</p>
<p>appear on an equal footing.
</p>
<p>By calculating matrix elements of the momentum operator in the coordinate
</p>
<p>representation I could establish a connection between the wave function formalism
</p>
<p>and Dirac notation. To calculate matrix elements of the momentum operator in the
</p>
<p>coordinate representation, I used the fifth postulate and the Poisson bracket of x and
</p>
<p>px to obtain the commutation relation between Ox and Opx and used the commutator to
show that

<p>hrj Op
ˇ̌
r0
˛
D &bdquo;
</p>
<p>i
r rı.r � r0/: (13.26)
</p>
<p>As a consequence, matrix elements of the entire Hamiltonian could be evaluated in
</p>
<p>the coordinate basis. The Hamiltonian is not diagonal in the coordinate representa-
</p>
<p>tion; however when the energy eigenkets are expanded in terms of the coordinate
</p>
<p>representation, the expansion coefficients turn out to be the wave function in
</p>
<p>coordinate space,
</p>
<p> E.r/ D hr jEi : (13.27)
</p>
<p>I will often use Dirac notation. Remember, however, that one must often revert
</p>
<p>to the wave function formalism to carry out any calculations. The time-dependent
</p>
<p>Schr&ouml;dinger equation can be written in Dirac notation as
</p>

<p>Example: As an example of the use of Dirac notation, consider a hydrogen atom
</p>
<p>(neglecting spin) in an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for the electron is
</p>
<p>OH D OH0 C ˇ0B � OL=&bdquo;; (13.33)
</p>
<p>where OH0 is the Hamiltonian in the absence of the magnetic field and ˇ0 is the
Bohr magneton. As long as the field is along the z axis, it is simple to find
</p>
<p>the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies since the Ym` &rsquo;s are still eigenfunctions. The
</p>
<p>energies are simply shifted by ˇ0mB, where m is the magnetic quantum number.
</p>
<p>However if the field is not along the z axis, it is not at all obvious how to solve for
</p>
<p>the eigenfunctions.
</p>
<p>In Dirac notation, it is trivial to obtain the eigenkets. The eigenkets are simply
</p>
<p>jn`mBi, where mB&bdquo; is the eigenvalue associated with the component of L along the
direction of the magnetic field. The eigenenergies are shifted by ˇ0mBB. Of course,
</p>
<p>the eigenfunctions are still not simple to obtain since hOr j`mBi is not a spherical
harmonic. However, if we express the Hamiltonian in terms of the (complete) set of
</p>
<p>eigenkets jn`mzi which is easy to do, then the eigenkets in the jn`mBi basis can be
obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, just as was done in Sect. 11.4.3 for the
</p>
<p>operator OLx. The eigenfunctions are obtained as linear combinations of the spherical
harmonics having the same `, but different m.
</p>
<p>13.1.8 Heisenberg Representation
</p>
<p>As a second example of the use of Dirac notation, I would like to discuss the
</p>
<p>Heisenberg representation or Heisenberg picture. The Schr&ouml;dinger operators I
</p>
<p>have been using are time-independent. The expectation values of these operators
</p>
<p>are time-dependent, in general, owing to the time-dependence of the wave functions
</p>
<p>or state vectors associated with a quantum system. In the Heisenberg representation,
</p>
<p>these roles are reversed. The state vector of the system becomes constant in time,
</p>
<p>whereas the Heisenberg operators are functions of time, in general.
</p>
<p>There is a unitary operator that connects the two representations. For a quantum
</p>
<p>system characterized by a Hamiltonian OH, I define the state vector in the Heisenberg
representation by
</p>
<p>j iH D e i&bdquo; OHtj .t/i D e i&bdquo; OHte� i&bdquo; OHtj .0/i D j .0/i ; (13.34)</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>318 13 (A) Review (B) Feynman Path-Integral Approach (C) Bell&rsquo;s Theorem

<p>which is constant in time. The expectation value of an operator OO is
</p>
<p>h OOi D h .t/j OOj .t/i D h .0/j e i&bdquo; OHt OOe� i&bdquo; OHtj .0/i

</p>
<p>The advantage of the Heisenberg picture is that the operators often obey equations
</p>
<p>of motion that are identical to their classical counterparts. Thus, Ehrenfest&rsquo;s theorem
</p>
<p>holds directly for the Heisenberg operators. It is important to note that commutation
</p>
<p>laws such as ŒOxH.t/; OpH.t/&#141; D i&bdquo; remain valid in the Heisenberg picture, but that
ŒOxH.t/; OpH.t0/&#141; &curren; i&bdquo;, in general, if t &curren; t0. The time-independent operator OH is the
same in both the Schr&ouml;dinger and Heisenberg representations.
</p>
<p>13.2 Feynman Path-Integral Approach
</p>
<p>In 1948 Richard Feynman published a paper in Reviews of Modern Physics entitled
</p>
<p>Space-Time Approach to Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics.1 In this paper, Feyn-
</p>
<p>man formulated an alternative theory of quantum mechanics based on propagators,
</p>
<p>rather than the Schr&ouml;dinger equation. As Feynman noted in his introduction, &ldquo;The
</p>
<p>formulation is equivalent to the more usual formulations. There are, therefore, no
</p>
<p>fundamentally new results. However, there is a pleasure in recognizing old things
</p>
<p>from a new point of view.&rdquo; It turns out that the propagator or path-integral approach
</p>
<p>is now used routinely in both non-relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics.2
</p>
<p>The approach is related to the WKB method that is discussed in Chap. 16 in that
</p>
<p>both effectively involve what is called a stationary phase approximation.
</p>
<p>Feynman&rsquo;s approach is based on the classical action. The classical action S for
</p>
<p>a particle having mass m moving in a potential V.r/ from position ra at time ta to
</p>
<p>position rb at time tb is defined by
</p>
<p>1R. P. Feynman, Reviews of Modern Physics, Vol. 20, pp. 367&ndash;387 (1948).
2A general discussion of the path-integral approach can be found in L. S. Schulman, Techniques
</p>
<p>and Applications of Path Integration (Dover Publications, Mineola, N.Y., 2005).</p>

� V.r/; (13.39)
</p>
<p>is the associated Lagrangian. The position r and velocity Pr appearing in these
equations are implicit functions of time. The Principle of Least Action states that
</p>
<p>of all the possible classical paths that take the particle from position ra at time ta
to position rb at time tb, the path that makes S an extremum corresponds to the
</p>
<p>actual dynamics of the particle. It is not overly difficult to show that the requirement
</p>
<p>ıS D 0, where ı corresponds to a variational derivative over particle trajectories
having fixed endpoints .ra; ta/ and .rb; tb/, leads to Lagrange&rsquo;s equation for the
</p>
<p>particle.
</p>
<p>In analogy with this concept, Feynman postulated that the wave function in
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics evolves as
</p>
<p> .r; t/ D
Z 1
</p>
<p>�1
K.r; tI r0; t0/ .r0; t0/dr0; (13.40)

</p>
<p>where N is a normalization constant. The functional differential Dr.t/ is not an
</p>
<p>integral over position; it defines an operation in which the integrand is summed over
</p>
<p>all classical paths from .ra; ta/ to .rb; tb/.
</p>
<p>Of course, you can postulate anything you want. Only if the postulates are
</p>
<p>consistent with experiment can they form the basis for a useful theory. In Feynman&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>case, he showed (by an argument reproduced in the Appendix) that his formulation
</p>
<p>was totally equivalent to that described by Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation. Moreover his
</p>
<p>formalism can offer some computational advantages for calculations in both non-
</p>
<p>relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics. I will show how the propagator can
</p>
<p>be calculated and then evaluate it for a free particle.
</p>
<p>The Feynman approach is similar to the Principle of Least Action, but there is
</p>
<p>a fundamental difference. In the Principle of Least Action, one path is picked out
</p>
<p>by demanding that the action is an extremum. On the other hand, the propagator
</p>
<p>in Eq. (13.41) involves a sum over all classical paths from .ra; ta/ to .rb; tb/: In
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics it is impossible to deterministically define the path of a particle.
</p>
<p>However, owing to the fact that &bdquo; appears in the denominator of the phase in the</p>
<p/>

<p>320 13 (A) Review (B) Feynman Path-Integral Approach (C) Bell&rsquo;s Theorem
</p>
<p>exponent in Eq. (13.41), the phase is expected to be large. In that case, the major
</p>
<p>contribution to the integral will be along the path for which the phase is an extremum
</p>
<p>(path of stationary phase), a condition on the action similar to that encountered in
</p>
<p>the classical case. For all other paths, the exponential factor oscillates rapidly and
</p>
<p>leads to destructive interference when the integral in Eq. (13.41) is evaluated.
</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the propagator, the time integral can be broken down into
</p>
<p>multiple steps, with the number of steps eventually approaching infinity. From the
</p>
<p>definition given in Eq. (13.38), it is clear that

<p>13.3 Bell&rsquo;s Theorem
</p>
<p>13.3.1 Proof of Bell&rsquo;s Theorem
</p>
<p>In Chap. 1, I promised a more detailed discussion of Bell&rsquo;s inequalities, once
</p>
<p>electron spin was introduced. I now make good on that promise. The proof of Bell&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>Theorem has nothing to do directly with quantum mechanics. It is based solely on
</p>
<p>measurements on correlated systems. I shall refer to each system as a &ldquo;particle,&rdquo; but
</p>
<p>this need not be the case. I assume that we have two particles (A and B/ and two
</p>
<p>detectors (1 and 2). The same property of each particle is measured at each detector,
</p>
<p>particle A is measured at detector 1 and particle B at detector 2. The measurements
</p>
<p>are assumed to be correlated and the correlation is assumed to occur as the result of
</p>
<p>some hidden variable encoded in the particles. The detectors are separated by a large
</p>
<p>distance, insofar as the measurement of one of the particles at one of the detectors
</p>
<p>cannot influence the measurement of the other particle at the other detector (this
</p>
<p>assumption implies that only local hidden variables, created in the particles at their
</p>
<p>creation, are used to explain the correlations between the particles).
</p>
<p>I now assume that each detector can result only in a measurement of ˙1 when
measuring the property of the particle. The value that is measured will depend on
</p>
<p>the angular orientation of the detector. Moreover, I assume that the measurements
</p>
<p>are perfectly anti-correlated for the same orientation of the detectors. That is, if</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.3 Bell&rsquo;s Theorem 323
</p>
<p>detector 1 measures a value C1 for an orientation ˛ of detector 1, then detector 2
must measure a value of�1 for the same orientation ˛ of detector 2. This correlation
is assumed to occur as a result of a hidden variable �.
</p>
<p>The proof of Bell&rsquo;s Theorem then follows directly.3 Let me denote the orientation

<p>measurements agree with the quantum predictions.
</p>
<p>13.3.3 Photon Polarization Measurements
</p>
<p>Experimentally it proved easier to use photons rather than spin to look for violations
</p>
<p>of Bell&rsquo;s inequalities. To understand how an experiment using photons can be used
</p>
<p>in a Bell&rsquo;s experiment, look at the atomic level scheme shown in Fig. 13.1. Atoms
</p>
<p>are prepared in level three and then undergo spontaneous emission that takes them
</p>
<p>to levels 2 and 1 via a cascade process in which a single photon is emitted on each
</p>
<p>transition (it is actually better to say that a single photon state is emitted on each
</p>
<p>transition since the radiation emerges as a pulse, not as a monochromatic plane
</p>
<p>wave state). There is no classical analogue of a single photon state, which makes it
</p>
<p>ideal to use in experiments to test Bell&rsquo;s inequalities.
</p>
<p>The polarization of the radiation depends on the angular momentum associated
</p>
<p>with each level and the direction of emission. If an ` D 0 ! 1 ! 0 cascade
is chosen, the radiation emitted on each transition is unpolarized in all directions,
</p>
<p>but the polarization of the successively emitted single photon states is correlated.
</p>
<p>In other words, if the polarization of the radiation emitted on the 3&ndash;2 transition is
</p>
<p>not measured, then measurements of the radiation on the 2&ndash;1 transition will show
</p>
<p>it to be unpolarized in any direction. The situation changes if polarizers are placed
</p>
<p>between the atoms and the detectors, and the outcome of the measurement on the
</p>
<p>2&ndash;1 transition is correlated with that on the 3&ndash;2 transition. For example, when the
</p>
<p>detectors are placed along opposite directions from the source and the polarizers

<p>by an n (no). For a given orientation of a single detector, 50% of the photons get
</p>
<p>through, on average. Thus if the detectors are at the same angles, there will be 50%
</p>
<p>yy and 50% nn and 0% yn or ny. When the detectors are at different angles, if the
</p>
<p>first photon gets through the first detector (which has a 50% probability), the second
</p>
<p>photon must have the same polarization as the first and there is a 25% [cos2.2�=3/
</p>
<p>or cos2.4�=3/] chance that it gets through the second detector and a 75% that it does
</p>
<p>not. Thus the probabilities are 0:125 .0:5�0:25/ for yy and 0:375 .0:5�0:75/ for yn.
On the other hand, if the first photon does not get through the first detector (which
</p>
<p>has a 50% probability), the second photon must have its polarization perpendicular
</p>
<p>to that of the first photon and there is a 75% [cos2.�=6/ or cos2.5�=6/] chance that
</p>
<p>it gets through the second detector and a 25% that it does not. Thus the probabilities
</p>
<p>are 0:375 .0:5 � 0:75/ for ny and 0:125 .0:5 � 0:25/ for nn: I now show how these
results lead to a contradiction if a local hidden variables theory is used.
</p>
<p>Assume now that each photon that is emitted already has its polarization encoded.
</p>
<p>When the detectors are aligned, there is a 100% correlation between the two
</p>
<p>photons, which implies that the photons carry the same code. Since there are three
</p>
<p>detector positions and two possible outcomes for each position (y or n), there are
</p>
<p>eight possible codes for each photon .yyy; yyn; yny; ynn; nyy; nny; nyn; nnn/. For
</p>
<p>example, yny implies that a photon will get through the detector for � D 0; 4�=3 but
not for � D 2�=3. Since n and y are equally likely for a given position, this implies
that the probability for each of yyn; yny; ynn; nyy; nny; nyn must be equal (call it ˇ)
</p>
<p>and that for each of yyy; nnn must be equal (call it ˛). Set the detectors at a relative
</p>
<p>angle of 2�=3 and try to calculate ˛ and ˇ. Let W.a; b; c/ represent the probability
</p>
<p>that we get the result a when the first detector is at 0, b when it is at 2�=3, and c
</p>
<p>when it is at 4�=3. In this example, only the a and b indices are relative&mdash;the third
</p>
<p>index can be either y or n and must be summed over for a specific choice of the first

</p>
<p>For example, the first line asks what is the probability that both photons get through
</p>
<p>the detectors (which was found to be 0.125 when the detectors are at a relative angle
</p>
<p>of 2�=3) and the third line that the first photon gets through and the second one
</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t (which was found to be 0.375 when the detectors are at a relative angle of

<p>2�=3). Solving for ˛ and ˇ gives ˇ D 0:375=2 and ˛ D �0:125=2. Since
negative probabilities are not allowed, we are led to a contradiction. Of course,

<p>13.3.4 Quantum Teleportation
</p>
<p>Entangled Bell states can be used as the basis for quantum teleportation.10 In clas-
</p>
<p>sical digital communication, messages to be transmitted are encoded into a stream
</p>
<p>of zeroes or ones, so-called classical bits of information. Such communication is
</p>
<p>not secure insofar as it can be intercepted by an &ldquo;eavesdropper.&rdquo; To avoid such
</p>
<p>problems, it is now possible to send encoded messages using quantum bits or qubits
</p>
<p>of information over distances as large as 1200 km.11
</p>
<p>A qubit is a quantum superposition state. For example, suppose Alice (in such
</p>
<p>examples, it seems that it is Alice who always sends information to Bob, trying to
</p>
<p>avoid eavesdropping by Eve) wants to send the superposition state
</p>
<p>j i1 D .˛ jHi1 C ˇ jVi1/ (13.74)
</p>
<p>to Bob. You can think of the states jHi1 and jVi1 as two orthogonal polarization
states (horizontal and vertical) of a single photon state; the subscript 1 indicates that
</p>
<p>this is the first photon state in this teleportation scheme. To initiate the teleportation
</p>
<p>protocol, she creates an entangled Bell state of two other single photon states, using
</p>
<p>a method such as cascade emission. For example, the entangled Bell state might be
</p>
<p>j i23 D
1p
2
.jHi2 jHi3 C jVi2 jVi3/ : (13.75)
</p>
<p>The subscripts 2 and 3 indicate that these states belong to the second and third single
</p>
<p>photon states. The third single photon state is sent to Bob and the second is kept by
</p>
<p>Alice. Alice now has two, single photon states (1 and 2), while Bob has one (3).

<p>13.4 Summary 331
</p>
<p>If the eavesdropper Eve intercepts the classical communication between Alice
</p>
<p>and Bob, it is useless to her since she doesn&rsquo;t have the single photon state that
</p>
<p>was sent to Bob. Moreover, if she intercepts the single photon state and makes a
</p>
<p>measurement on it, she will necessarily corrupt that superposition state. It will be
</p>
<p>evident to Alice and Bob that someone has been listening in.
</p>
<p>13.3.5 Why the Big Fuss?
</p>
<p>There are thousands of papers written on Bell&rsquo;s inequalities and more appear
</p>
<p>regularly. Many people believe in the validity of Bell&rsquo;s theorem and some don&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>The carrying out of &ldquo;loophole-free&rdquo; experiments demonstrating violations of Bell&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>inequalities has enhanced or even made some scientific careers. The New York
</p>
<p>Times seems to be enamored with experiments that prove &ldquo;Einstein was wrong&rdquo;
</p>
<p>and confirm &ldquo;spooky action at a distance.&rdquo; It seems that people are either fascinated,
</p>
<p>disturbed, or dissatisfied (or some combination of these) with experiments that have
</p>
<p>shown violations of Bell&rsquo;s inequalities.
</p>
<p>I am not of the opinion that all this attention is merited. In the spin experiment, for
</p>
<p>example, each observer detects spin up or spin down 50% of the time, on average,
</p>
<p>independent of the orientation of her detector. It is only when the observers use
</p>
<p>classical communication channels to compare the results of their measurements do
</p>
<p>they find that there are correlations. How do they explain such correlations? To say
</p>
<p>that one measurement influenced the other is not particularly meaningful. In effect,
</p>
<p>the best answer to this question is &ldquo;the reason there are correlations is because there
</p>
<p>are correlations.&rdquo; It is the same as asking people why two neutral objects attract
</p>
<p>one another. Attributing this attraction to &ldquo;gravity&rdquo; does not in any way explain the
</p>
<p>attraction. The laws of nature are what they are. People have become familiar with
</p>
<p>gravitational attraction, but do not experience the effects of quantum correlations
</p>
<p>in their everyday lives. If quantum mechanics is a correct theory, there will be
</p>
<p>violations of Bell&rsquo;s inequalities even if the proof of Bell&rsquo;s theorem has flaws. This
</p>
<p>does not prevent people from looking for alternative theories, as Einstein did in
</p>
<p>formulating an alternative theory of gravity in his Theory of General Relativity, but
</p>
<p>so far there has not yet been a theory to replace quantum mechanics. I believe that
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics remains in incomplete theory insofar as it does not address the
</p>
<p>dynamics of wave function collapse.
</p>
<p>13.4 Summary
</p>
<p>This chapter serves as a bridge between the introductory course material and the
</p>
<p>more advanced applications of the basic theory. A brief review was presented.
</p>
<p>I have also taken the opportunity to present two additional topics. The first was an
</p>
<p>alternative approach to the quantum theory based on the Feynman&rsquo;s path integrals</p>

<p>and the second a more detailed treatment of Bell&rsquo;s theorem. These are both
</p>
<p>interesting topics, but the results that were derived are not used in the remainder
</p>
<p>of this text.
</p>
<p>13.5 Appendix: Equivalence of Feynman Path Integral
</p>
<p>and Schr&ouml;dinger Equation
</p>
<p>In this Appendix, I show that Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation can be derived from the
</p>
<p>Feynman propagator. I work in one-dimension to simplify matters, but the results
</p>
<p>can be generalized easily to three dimensions. In the Feynman approach, the wave
</p>
<p>function at time t is related to that at time t0 by the integral equation

</p>
<p> .x; t/ I consider an infinitesimal time interval � with t D t0 C � for which the
propagator can be approximated as

<p>Perturbation Theory
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is impossible to obtain analytic solutions of the Schr&ouml;dinger
</p>
<p>equation for most potentials. However there is a large class of problems in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics where the Hamiltonian consists of two parts. The first part corresponds to
</p>
<p>an isolated quantum system, such as a hydrogen atom, for which we know the exact
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions and eigenenergies. The second part of the Hamiltonian corresponds
</p>
<p>to the interaction of the isolated quantum system with some external potential. If the
</p>
<p>second potential is weak (and I have to define what I mean by weak), it is possible to
</p>
<p>develop a systematic procedure to approximate the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues
</p>
<p>of the total Hamiltonian. This procedure is referred to as perturbation theory.
</p>
<p>Perturbation theory is covered in all standard texts. I will stress some points that
</p>
<p>are not often discussed in the standard treatments of the problem. The basic idea is
</p>
<p>simple. Suppose we can write the Hamiltonian of a system as
</p>
<p>OH D OH0 C � OH0 (14.1)
</p>
<p>or, in matrix form, as
</p>
<p>H
&macr;
D H
</p>
<p>&macr;
0 C �H
</p>
<p>&macr;
</p>
<p>0: (14.2)
</p>
<p>The quantity � is just for bookkeeping&mdash;I will eventually set it equal to unity. It
</p>
<p>lets us keep track of the fact that OH0 is supposed to be a small perturbation to OH0,
whatever that means. Furthermore I assume that we know the eigenfunctions .0/n .r/
</p>
<p>of OH0 and the corresponding eigenvalues E.0/n ;
</p>
<p>OH0 .0/n .r/ D E.0/n  .0/n .r/: (14.3)

<p>(remember that jEni.0/ is a column matrix with 1 in the nth location and zeroes
everywhere else). The problem is then straightforward&mdash;how can we approximate
</p>
<p>the energies and eigenfunctions or eigenkets for the total Hamiltonian. In Dirac
</p>
<p>notation, we are simply trying to develop methods for approximately diagonalizing
</p>
<p>a Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>14.1 Non-degenerate Perturbation Theory
</p>
<p>I will derive the perturbation theory results using Dirac notation and then simply list
</p>
<p>the corresponding results for the wave functions. In non-degenerate perturbation
</p>
<p>theory, it is assumed that any states coupled by the perturbation (that is, states jni
and jn0i for which H
</p>
<p>&macr;
0
nn0
&curren; 0) have different energies.
</p>
<p>I start from
</p>

</p>
<p>jEni D jEni.0/ C � jEni.1/ C �2 jEni.2/ C � � � ; (14.6b)
</p>
<p>substitute it into Eq. (14.5c) and equate equal powers of �. After that, I can set
</p>
<p>� D 1, since it was used only for bookkeeping. I calculate corrections to the energy
to order E
</p>
<p>.2/
n and to the wave function to order jEni.1/.
</p>
<p>Equating coefficients of �0 simply reproduces Eq. (14.5b). Equating coefficients

<p>The .0/ hEn jEni.1/ term in this expression is often confusing to students. In mth
order perturbation theory, the value of .0/ hEn jEni.m/ is completely arbitrary since it
cannot be determined from Eqs. (14.5) and (14.6). This is not tragic, however, since
</p>
<p>the mth order value of the energy and mth order expectation values of all operators
</p>
<p>in a state j i are independent of the values of .0/ hEn jEni.q/ for q &lt; m. In effect,
different choices for .0/ hEn jEni.m/ simply result in different normalization factors
for the eigenkets.
</p>
<p>Conventionally the value of .0/ hEn jEni.m/ is set equal to zero for all m. With this
choice, the eigenkets calculated in each order of perturbation theory are determined
</p>
<p>uniquely and the mth order eigenket does not depend on the values of .0/ hEn jEni.q/
for q &lt; m (clearly, since they have been set equal to zero). The price you pay is that
</p>
<p>the eigenkets are not normalized, in general, in each order of perturbation theory.
</p>
<p>The first order eigenkets are normalized, however, since</p>

</p>
<p>14.2 Degenerate Perturbation Theory
</p>
<p>Clearly nondegenerate perturbation theory breaks down whenever there is energy
</p>
<p>degeneracy, if the degenerate levels are coupled by the perturbation. As an example,
</p>
<p>consider the 2 � 2 matrix
</p>
<p>H
&macr;
D
�
</p>
<p>a �
</p>
<p>� a
</p>
<p>�
; (14.47)
</p>
<p>with � � a and both a and � positive. The eigenvalues are
</p>
<p>E1 D a � �; E2 D aC �; (14.48)
</p>
<p>and the eigenkets are
</p>
<p>jE1i �
1p
2
</p>
<p>�
1
</p>
<p>�1
</p>
<p>�
; jE2i �
</p>
<p>1p
2
</p>
<p>�
1
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>�
: (14.49)
</p>
<p>In other words, although the eigenenergies are changed only slightly if � � a, the
eigenkets are changed to zeroth order in �. Sometimes it is possible to guess the
</p>
<p>correct eigenkets by building in some physics and using &ldquo;good&rdquo; quantum numbers.
</p>
<p>I will look at this more carefully after I have reviewed angular momentum and spin.
</p>
<p>However without some physics to fall back on, you must diagonalize any degenerate
</p>
<p>submatrix exactly and then proceed using normal degenerate perturbation theory.
</p>
<p>Even then, there can be some traps.
</p>
<p>Before giving some examples, let me put the problem in some perspective.
</p>
<p>Consider the energy levels in hydrogen, neglecting spin. Each state characterized
</p>
<p>by the quantum number n is n2 fold degenerate. If a perturbation couples states
</p>
<p>within a given manifold designated by n, then nondegenerate perturbation theory
</p>
<p>fails. In essence, each submatrix corresponding to the degenerate manifold must
</p>
<p>be diagonalized exactly. Then, using the new eigenkets, you can carry out non-
</p>
<p>degenerate perturbation theory between different n manifolds. Often, the small
</p>
<p>additional corrections produced by such coupling are of little interest. In that case,
</p>
<p>degenerate perturbation theory consists simply of diagonalizing each degenerate
</p>
<p>manifold of levels. The examples should make this clear.
</p>

<p>The eigenenergies are good approximations to the exact eigenenergies as is

I go wrong? It turns out that if you calculate second order corrections to the wave

(of order 0.1) divided by QE.0/2 � QE

</p>
<p>Thus the second order correction to jE1i is of the same order as the first order
corrections of jE3i. Thus, if you want eigenkets jE1i and jE2i correct to order 0:001
you must diagonalize the entire matrix.
</p>
<p>To be a bit more specific, if the matrix elements that couple the degenerate
</p>
<p>states in a given manifold of levels is large compared to those that couple these
</p>
<p>levels to levels outside the degenerate subblock, then the procedure of diagonalizing
</p>
<p>the degenerate subblock and then applying degenerate perturbation theory is valid.
</p>
<p>However when these couplings are comparable, the method fails to give the new
</p>
<p>eigenkets of the degenerate states to first order in the coupling, it gives it only to
</p>
<p>zeroth order in the coupling. It does give the correct energies. Usually in degenerate
</p>
<p>perturbation theory we are content to have the degenerate eigenkets correct to zeroth
</p>
<p>order in the perturbation. In other words, in degenerate perturbation theory, the states
</p>
<p>outside the degenerate subspace are often not considered at all, since they produce
</p>
<p>small modifications to the eigenkets, provided the coupling strength is much less
</p>
<p>than the energy spacing between nondegenerate energy manifolds.

<p>Example 2 Linear Stark shift in hydrogen for n D 2:
A classic example of degenerate perturbation theory is the linear Stark effect in
</p>
<p>hydrogen. In the n D 2 state of hydrogen, neglecting spin and the Lamb shift [the
modifications of the energy levels resulting from spin and the Lamb shift (produced</p>

</p>
<p>degenerate levels corresponding to n D 2; ` D 0 and n D 2; ` D 1;m` D 0;˙1. In
the presence of a static electric field, E D Euz directed along the z axis,

</p>
<p>where Ope D �eOr is the electric dipole moment operator, e the magnitude of the
charge of the electron, and z the coordinate of the electron relative to the proton.
</p>
<p>This interaction couples only states having different parity. It couples only the n D
2; ` D 0 and ` D 1 states. Moreover, the matrix element of Oz is nonvanishing only
between the n D 2; ` D 0 and n D 2; ` D 1;m` D 0 states. The matrix element
that is needed, h210j eE 1r cos � j200i, can be calculated using the hydrogenic wave
functions and one finds
</p>
<p>h210j eE 1r cos � j200i D �3eEa0; (14.68)
</p>
<p>where a0 is the Bohr radius. Thus the symmetric state,

<p>is raised by this amount. There are higher order corrections to the energy and wave

<p>functions of the n D 2 state that arise from couplings to states outside the n D 2
manifold. These can be calculated using nondegenerate perturbation theory with the
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions  s and  a.
</p>
<p>The mixing of different parity states of hydrogen produced by an external electric
</p>
<p>field is important in problems involving spontaneous emission. The  200 state is
</p>
<p>metastable, living for about 1/7 of a second, since it cannot decay to the ground
</p>
<p>state via a dipole transition. However, if an electric field mixes in some of the  210
state, the transition becomes electric-dipole allowed and the atom decays rapidly, on
</p>
<p>the order on nanoseconds. For atoms other than hydrogen, there is no &ldquo;accidental&rdquo;
</p>
<p>degeneracy of states having different parity and there is no linear Stark shift, only a
</p>
<p>quadratic Stark shift that can be calculated using second order perturbation theory.

</p>
<p>perturbation. Different techniques are required when there is degeneracy in the
</p>
<p>unperturbed energy levels; effectively, part of the Hamiltonian corresponding to
</p>
<p>coupled degenerate states must be diagonalized exactly. The perturbation theory
</p>
<p>outlined in this chapter can be applied to a wide range of problems in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics. However there are other classes of problems where approximate solu-
</p>
<p>tions can still be obtained even though the Hamiltonian cannot be written as the sum
</p>
<p>of an exactly solvable part and a &ldquo;small&rdquo; perturbation. It is to such cases that I now
</p>
<p>turn my attention.
</p>
<p>14.4 Problems
</p>
<p>1&ndash;2. To see the effect of the normalization term ˛n D.0/ hEn jEni.1/ on the expec-
tation value of operators, suppose there is a two-state quantum system whose eigen-
</p>
<p>kets in the absence of any perturbations are j1i.0/ and j2i.0/. Moreover, assume that
there is a perturbation having matrix elements H021 D H012 such that, to first order in
H021,
</p>
<p>j1i � .1C ˛1/ j1i.0/ � ˇ j2i.0/ I
j2i � .1C ˛2/ j2i.0/ C ˇ j1i.0/ ;

<p>where ˇ D H012=
�
</p>
<p>E
.0/
2 � E
</p>
<p>.0/
1
</p>
<p>�
. To simplify matters, neglect all terms of order ˇ2 in
</p>
<p>this problem (first order perturbation theory) and take ˛1, ˛2, as real (ˇ is assumed
</p>
<p>real since H021 D H012 and OH0 is Hermitian). Take the state vector for the quantum
system as j i D j1i.0/ and assume that there is a Hermitian operator OA associated
with this system having matrix elements in the unperturbed basis given by Aij (i D
1; 2; j D 1; 2): Clearly the expectation value of OA in the state j i is equal to A11.
(a) Expand the state vector j i as
</p>
<p>j i D b1 j1i C b2 j2i
</p>
<p>and evaluate b1 and b2 in terms of ˛1, ˛2, and ˇ to first order in ˇ. This shows
</p>
<p>you that the new state vectors depend on the choice of ˛1 and ˛2.
</p>
<p>(b) Evaluate h1 j1i and h2 j2i in terms of ˛1, ˛2, and ˇ to first order in ˇ.
(c) Finally calculate

<p>362 15 Variational Approach
</p>
<p>orthogonal to the ground state wave function, then you can also use this method
</p>
<p>to estimate the energy of the first excited state. For example, if the ground state is
</p>
<p>an ` D 0 state, you can choose a trial wave function for the first excited state that
corresponds to a ` D 1 state, implying that c0 D 0. Most of the time the variational
method is used to obtain ground state energies.
</p>
<p>The advantage of the variational approach over perturbation theory is that the
</p>
<p>exact Hamiltonian is used. That is, sometimes the Hamiltonian cannot be written
</p>
<p>as OH D OH0 C OH0 in any obvious fashion. The disadvantage of the method is that it
depends on how good your guess is. There is no simple way to estimate its accuracy.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking you keep adding parameters to your trial wave function and see
</p>
<p>if the energy converges.
</p>
<p>Another advantage of the variational approach is that if you are a fairly good
</p>
<p>guesser, you are rewarded with an excellent approximation to the energy. Imagine
</p>
<p>you guess
</p>
<p> t.r/ D  n.r/C ı n.r/; (15.4)
</p>
<p>where  n.r/ is the exact wave function. Then

</p>
<p>that is, the error is of order Œı n.r/&#141;
2.
</p>
<p>Of course there may be no way you can guess the wave function. However, if the
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian can be written as
</p>
<p>OH D OH0 C OH0; (15.6)
</p>
<p>where OH0 is a small perturbation to OH0, you can use the wave function obtained
from perturbation theory that is correct to second order in OH0 as a trial function to
calculate the energy correct to order OH04:

<p>I will give two examples of calculations using the variational approach. First,

<p>15.1 Combining Perturbation Theory and the Variational
</p>
<p>Approach
</p>
<p>The variational approach gives an upper bound for the ground state energy of a
</p>
<p>quantum system. It is sometimes possible to use conventional perturbation theory to
</p>
<p>get a lower bound for the ground state energy. In this way you can get both upper
</p>
<p>and lower bounds for the energy. Suppose you have a quantum system for which the
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian is
</p>
<p>OH D OH0 C OH0: (15.20)
</p>
<p>It is assumed that you know the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions of OH0 and that
OH0 can be considered as a perturbation. I denote the ground state energy by E.0/g
and the change in the ground state energy resulting from the perturbation by &#129;Eg.
</p>
<p>Moreover I assume that the first order correction resulting from the perturbation
</p>
<p>vanishes, H0gg D 0. Then the change in the ground state energy, calculated using
perturbation theory, is given approximately by

Recall that the prime on the summation symbol is a shorthand notation for a sum

<p>over bound states and an integral over continuum states. To illustrate the technique,
</p>
<p>I calculate both upper and lower bounds for the van der Waals interaction energy
</p>
<p>between two ground state hydrogen atoms.
</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian in this case is given by Eq. (15.20) with

carried out in the coordinate representation where the operators in OH0 are replaced
by their functional values). The ground state has n1 D n2 D 1 and the lowest energy

<p>370 15 Variational Approach
</p>
<p>The experimental result is �78:9 eV so I have done better than might be expected.
I can use the variational method to get an even better estimate. Since each
</p>
<p>electron is partially shielded from the nucleus by the other electron, I try a
</p>
<p>(normalized) trial wave function of the form
</p>
<p> t .r1; r2/ D

</p>
<p>�a3
e�.r1Cr2/=a (15.47)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>a D a0=Zeff (15.48)
</p>
<p>and Zeff is the parameter to be varied. I expect to find 1 &lt; Zeff &lt; 2, since Zeff is
</p>
<p>the shielded nuclear charge seen by each electron. The Hamiltonian (15.38) can be
</p>
<p>written as OH D OH1 C OH2, with

corresponds to a Hamiltonian in which each electron moves independently in the

<p>15.3 Summary
</p>
<p>The variational method is an extremely powerful method for obtaining the ground
</p>
<p>state energy of quantum systems. It is the preferred method for approximating the
</p>
<p>ground state energy of atoms such as helium. In certain cases, the variational method
</p>
<p>can be combined with perturbation theory to obtain both lower and upper bounds
</p>
<p>for the ground state energy.
</p>

<p>which satisfies the boundary condition at z D 0. Compare your answer with
the value, E0 D 2:3381.&bdquo;2mg2=2/1=3; obtained from an exact solution of the
Schr&ouml;dinger equation.
</p>
<p>2&ndash;3. Use the variational method to estimate an upper bound E0� to the ground state
</p>
<p>energy of a particle having mass m moving in a potential V.x/ D V0 jx=aj�, using
a Gaussian trial wave function,  t D e�x
</p>
<p>2=b2 . You can assume that �, V0, and a are
</p>
<p>greater than zero and use the fact that</p>

<p>where &#128; is the gamma function. Show that your result yields E0� D &bdquo;!0=2 when
� D 2 and V0 D m!20=2. Why does the upper bound give the exact result in this
case? Plot Eu=V0 as a function of � for ˇ
</p>
<p>2 D 2mV0a2=&bdquo;2 D 1 and 0 � � � 5.
As � ! 1, show that the potential approaches that of an infinite square well
having width 2a, but that the variational upper bound for the energy diverges.
</p>
<p>This shows that the choice of a Gaussian trial function for large values of � is
</p>
<p>not a good choice. Why not? [Note: The exact ground state energies are given by
</p>
<p>.Eexact=V0/ ˇ
�=.�C2/ D 1:0188; 1; 1:02295; 1:06036; 1:1023 for � D 1; 2; 3; 4; 5.]
</p>
<p>4. Repeat the previous calculation to estimate an upper bound E1� to the first
</p>
<p>excited state energy of a particle having mass m moving in the potential V.x/ D
V0 jx=aj�, where � is a positive integer. Now you must take a trial wave function
that is consistent with the parity of the first excited state.
</p>
<p>5. The Hamiltonian of a quantum system is given by OH D OH0C OH0, where OH0 can be
considered as a perturbation. If the first order perturbation theory contribution to the
</p>
<p>ground state energy E
.1/
0 vanishes, prove that the second order correction satisfies

<p>E

</p>
<p>.0/

</p>
<p>h0j OH02 j0i :
</p>
<p>where E
.0/
1 is the first excited state energy. Use this result to get a lower bound for
</p>
<p>the Stark shift of the ground state of hydrogen when the atom is put into an external,
</p>
<p>constant electric field E along the z axis for which OH0 D eE Oz. It turns out that the
second order correction can be evaluated exactly and is given by
</p>
<p>&#129;E D �9

.4��0/ E
</p>
<p>2a30:
</p>
<p>How does your bound compare?
</p>
<p>6&ndash;7. Now do a variational calculation to get an upper bound for the ground state
</p>
<p>energy of hydrogen in a static electric field. Since the field couples states with
</p>
<p>opposite parity, you can try a trial wave function of the form
</p>
<p> t D
e�r=a0
p
�a
</p>
<p>3=2
0
</p>
<p>.1C ˇH0/;
</p>
<p>with H0 D eEz, and vary ˇ to get the upper bound. Combine this result with that of
Problem 15.5 and show that the exact solution fits between your two bounds.</p>

<p>WKB Approximation
</p>
<p>16.1 WKB Wave Functions
</p>
<p>The WKB (Wentzel, Kramers, Brillouin) approximation is covered in most standard
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics texts. Basically, the WKB approximation is a type of eikonal
</p>
<p>approximation in which it is assumed the potential varies very slowly compared
</p>
<p>with the average de Broglie wavelength of a particle. In some sense, the quantum
</p>
<p>particle is acting somewhat like a classical particle. This is not quite the case, since
</p>
<p>the particle is still described by a wave function. It is like trying to have the best
</p>
<p>of both the classical and quantum worlds. Generally it is valid for high energies
</p>
<p>such that the de Broglie wavelength is large compared with distances over which
</p>
<p>the potential varies significantly.
</p>
<p>Since this is a type of semi-classical approximation, it makes sense to look for
</p>
<p>a solution of Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation as a power series in &bdquo;. Terms to zeroth order
in &bdquo; correspond to a classical limit and the higher order terms provide quantum
corrections. The WKB method generally works only in 1-D problems, but can be
</p>
<p>used in problems in 3-D with spherical symmetry, since the radial equation is an
</p>
<p>equation in one variable. I consider only one-dimensional motion in the x direction
</p>
<p>in this chapter, but return to the radial equation in discussing scattering theory.
</p>
<p>The time independent Schr&ouml;dinger equation is
</p>
<p> 00 C k2.x/ D 0 (16.1)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>k.x/ D

</p>
<p>&bdquo;2 ŒE � V.x/&#141; D p.x/=&bdquo; (16.2)
</p>
<p>and primes indicate derivatives with respect to x: For the moment I assume that
</p>
<p>E &gt; V.x/ so that k.x/ is real and positive. If k were a constant, then the solution of
</p>
<p>Eq. (16.1) would be  .x/ D e˙ikx: This suggests that I try a solution of the form

<p>16.2 Connection Formulas
</p>
<p>As long as conditions (16.16) and (16.17) are satisfied, the WKB method can be
</p>
<p>used to approximate the eigenfunctions for a particle moving in a potential V.x/.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check to see when we can expect this to be the case for the potentials shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 16.1. (a) Assuming that conditions (16.16) and (16.17) hold, then the WKB
</p>
<p>approximation is valid for all x, and the WKB eigenfunctions for a given energy
</p>
<p>correspond to particles moving to the right or left. If you construct a wave packet
</p>
<p>having average energy E greater than the barrier height incident from the left, you
</p>
<p>will find that there is no reflected wave, the wave packet and simply moves to the
</p>
<p>right, adjusting its kinetic energy to changes in the barrier height. (b) In this case,
</p>
<p>the WKB approximation necessarily breaks down at the point discontinuities in the
</p>
<p>potential since dV=dx D 1 at these points. In the exact quantum problem, there
is always a reflected wave. We have seen already that the reflection coefficient is
</p>
<p>independent of &bdquo; for step potentials in the high energy limit. In Fig. 16.1c&ndash;f, the
WKB approximation necessarily fails at the classical turning points a and b since
</p>
<p>the momentum p.x/ D 0 at such points.
Even when there are classical turning points for a given energy, it is still
</p>
<p>possible to use the WKB approximation. One proceeds by calculating the WKB
</p>
<p>wave functions in the regions away from the turning points and piecing together
</p>
<p>the solutions using the exact solutions in the vicinity of the turning points. At each</p>

h=p.x/ D 2�=k.x/ is infinite. It is generally assumed that the potential varies
linearly with x in the region of a turning point and that the slope is sufficiently
</p>
<p>small to insure that the exact solution for a linear potential (which are so-called Airy
</p>
<p>functions) extends into the region where the WKB wave functions are valid. In this
</p>
<p>manner, one arrives at a number of connection formulas which tell you how to piece

the exact wave functions at the origin (with this choice the WKB wave functions are

3:80, 7:46, 11:6. Not so great for n D 0; but not too bad for n � 1. As q ! 1,
the potential approximates an infinite square well potential having width 2x0 and
</p>
<p>the WKB energies vary as .nC 1=2/2. The WKB energies given by Eq. (16.35) of
the high-lying n states nearly coincide with the exact results, but the n D 0 state
energy is off by a factor of 4, since a better quantization condition to use is the
</p>
<p>one given in Eq. (16.28), rather than that given in Eq. (16.23), because the potential

<p>384 16 WKB Approximation
</p>
<p>It turns out that inequality (16.41) holds over a large range of parameter space. It
</p>
<p>is violated near x=x0 D 0 if q � 1 (the derivative of the potential diverges at the
origin if q &lt; 1) and near the turning points. The worst violations (that is, over the
</p>
<p>largest range of x=x0) occur for n D 0 and for q of order unity. It is not readily
apparent to me how the validity condition for the WKB wave function given in
</p>
<p>Eq. (16.41) translates into one for the accuracy of the energy levels calculated using
</p>
<p>the WKB approximation. That is, although the violation of inequality (16.41) for
</p>
<p>n D 0 decreases with increasing q for fixed ˇ, the relative error in the n D 0
energy calculated in the WKB approximation increases with increasing q. As was
</p>
<p>mentioned previously, this can be associated with using the wrong quantization
</p>
<p>condition as the potential begins to approximate the infinite square well potential.3
</p>
<p>For fixed q and ˇ, the WKB approximation becomes better with increasing n.
</p>
<p>The connection formulas can also be used to calculate the reflection and
</p>
<p>transmission coefficients for the barrier shown in Fig. 16.1f. You start with the WKB

<p>16.4 Summary
</p>
<p>The WKB approximation is generally referred to as a semi-classical approximation
</p>
<p>since it is valid in the limit of large energies, where the de Broglie wave length
</p>
<p>is large over distances in which the potential varies significantly. It always fails at
</p>
<p>classical turning points, but connection formulas can be used to connect the WKB

<p>wave functions in regions on both sides of the turning point. The WKB method
</p>
<p>provides a relatively simple way for estimating the energies of all but the lowest
</p>
<p>energy bound states in one-dimensional problems. The equation that allows you to
</p>
<p>do this, Eq. (16.24), is essentially the Bohr quantization condition.
</p>
<p>16.5 Appendix: Connection Formulas
</p>
<p>To illustrate how the connection formulas can be derived, I consider the case where
</p>
<p>the turning point is at x D a such that the classical region is to the left of the turning
point. The basic idea is to expand the potential in the region of the turning point and
</p>
<p>keep only the term that is linear in x� a. That is, in the region of the turning point I
approximate

</p>

</p>
<p>since E D V.a/: From Fig. 16.1 you can see that the slope is positive at the turning
point at x D a: The next step is to obtain an exact solution of Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation
for this potential and hope that the solution remains valid at distances sufficiently
</p>
<p>far from x D a to join with the WKB solutions. This will normally be the case if
the general validity conditions for the WKB approximation given in Eqs. (16.16)
</p>
<p>and (16.17) are satisfied, provided the first derivative of the potential at the turning
</p>
<p>point does not vanish.
</p>
<p>In the region of the turning point, Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation is

<p>Scattering: 1-D
</p>
<p>Most of what we know about the structure of matter comes from scattering
</p>
<p>experiments. When I discuss scattering in 3-D, I will review classical scattering
</p>
<p>theory, but for the time being, I want to discuss the scattering problem in one-
</p>
<p>dimension. Scattering is simple in principle&mdash;send something in and see what
</p>
<p>comes out. I will give a detailed analysis of scattering in one-dimension for the
</p>
<p>step potential shown in Fig. 17.1 and then give a qualitative discussion for other
</p>
<p>potentials. The step potential can be written as
</p>
<p>V.x/ D V0&sbquo;.x/; (17.1)
</p>
<p>where&sbquo;.x/ is the Heaviside step function which is zero for x &lt; 0 and one for x � 0:
Classically, this is a simple problem. If the energy of a particle incident from the
</p>
<p>left is less than V0, it is reflected at the potential step with a change in the sign of
</p>
<p>its velocity; if the energy is greater than V0 there is no reflection and the particle
</p>
<p>is transmitted with reduced energy. However, for a true step potential, the problem
</p>
<p>is always quantum-mechanical in nature since the potential changes over a distance
</p>
<p>that is small compared to a de Broglie wavelength of the particle. In that case, part
</p>
<p>of the wave packet is always reflected if E &gt; V0. Of course, a real potential can only
</p>
<p>approximate a step function; quantum mechanics is needed if the potential changes
</p>
<p>over a distance that is small compared to a de Broglie wavelength of the particle. As
</p>
<p>you will see, there is an additional quantum effect when the energy is less than the
</p>
<p>height of the step.
</p>
<p>There are two basic approaches to solving a scattering problem. In the steady-
</p>
<p>state approach, it is assumed that some type of steady-state has been reached in
</p>
<p>which a continuous, mono-energetic beam of particles is incident on the scattering
</p>
<p>region. You can then identify a current density for both the incident and scattered
</p>
<p>particles. This is the easiest way to do scattering theory and corresponds to
</p>
<p>the idealized situation in which there is a single energy in the problem, since
</p>
<p>the incoming beam is mono-energetic. In effect we deal with a single energy

<p>392 17 Scattering: 1-D
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.1 Step potential: (a) Energy less than the barrier height. (b) Energy greater than the barrier
</p>
<p>height
</p>
<p>eigenstate of the system. The second approach is more difficult mathematically,
</p>
<p>but more interesting from a physical viewpoint. In this time-dependent approach,
</p>
<p>one sends in a wave packet to the scattering region and looks at the emerging
</p>
<p>wave packets. Both methods give identical results for the reflection and transmission
</p>
<p>coefficients when the spatial width of the wave packet is taken to be arbitrarily large
</p>
<p>(approaching a mono-energetic wave). Scattering is usually a uniquely well-defined
</p>
<p>problem only in this limit.
</p>
<p>Before we start, let me consider the classical scattering problem with one particle
</p>
<p>a second having energy E &gt; V0 moving towards the step potential from the left
</p>
<p>with a velocity of one meter per second. The situation is depicted in Fig. 17.2 for
</p>
<p>successive times differing by one second. As can be seen, the density per unit length
</p>
<p>increases for particles once they are past the barrier, and the speed of each particle
</p>
<p>decreases. However the current density J D Nv, where N is the density per unit
length, remains constant. The ratio of the transmitted to incident particle current
</p>
<p>density is a measure of the transmission coefficient, which is unity in the classical
</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>Returning to the quantum problem, I proceed as in any problem in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics by finding the stationary state eigenfunctions. If Ek D &bdquo;2k2=2m &gt; V0
and m is the mass of the particle, independent (normalized) eigenfunctions for the

<p>I assume that there is a single energy eigenfunction, corresponding to a wave

</p>
<p>associated with  Ck .x/ into three parts, the e

</p>
<p>the incident wave, the e�ikx part for x &lt; 0 corresponding to the reflected wave, and
the eikx or e��x part for x &gt; 0 corresponding to the transmitted wave. Thus, the

</p>
<p>17.2 Time-Dependent Approach
</p>
<p>In the time-dependent approach, the initial state wave function is expanded in terms
</p>
<p>of the stationary state eigenfunctions  
C;�
k .x/ to obtain the expansion coefficients
</p>
<p>ˆ.k/, which are then used to calculate  .x; t/ as

</p>
<p>�
e�i&bdquo;k
</p>
<p>2t=2m: (17.22)
</p>
<p>The integral is restricted to positive values of k since the eigenfunctions  
C;�
k .x/
</p>
<p>given in Eqs. (17.2) and (17.8) are so restricted. The key point in solving the
</p>
<p>scattering problem in this fashion is to choose a wave packet incident from the left</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>396 17 Scattering: 1-D
</p>
<p>that is sufficiently broad to insure that it does not spread much on the time scale of
</p>
<p>the scattering. Moreover, it should be much broader than the distance over which
</p>
<p>the potential varies significantly (in this case the variation occurs as a step, so the
</p>
<p>packet is always larger in extent than the interval over which the potential changes).
</p>
<p>In other words, you want the central energy E0 associated with the incident wave
</p>
<p>packet to be fairly well-defined. The same type of formalism can then be used for
</p>
<p>both E0 &gt; V0 and E0 &lt; V0.
</p>
<p>Since the incident wave packet is localized to the left of the step and moving to
</p>
<p>the right, ˆ�.k/ � 0. Moreover, to calculate the expansion coefficients from the
initial wave packet, I can neglect any of the e�ikx components of the eigenfunctions
 Ck .x/ given in Eqs. (17.2a) and (17.8), respectively, since they correspond to a
wave packet moving to the left. To a good approximation, the initial wave function,
</p>
<p>centered at x D �x0 &lt; 0 at time t D 0 can be expanded as
</p>
<p> .x; 0/ �

<p>whereˆ.k/ is a real function, sharply peaked about k D k0, corresponding to energy
</p>
<p>E0 D &bdquo;2k20=2m; (17.24)
</p>
<p>and the integral is extended to�1 based on the assumption thatˆ.k/ � 0 for k &lt; 0.
In other words, the initial wave packet doesn&rsquo;t yet know about the step potential it
</p>
<p>is going to encounter, so it can be expanded in terms of free-particle plane wave
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions. This is a key step in solving the problem.
</p>
<p>After a time t� x0=v0, with v0 defined by
</p>
<p>v0 D &bdquo;k0=m; (17.25)
</p>
<p>the scattering is finished. I now look at the wave function for times t� x0=v0.
There is one final point to note before starting the calculation. For a wave packet
</p>
<p>moving to the right with a fairly well-defined energy, I can write Eq. (17.23) as
</p>
<p> .x; 0/ � 1p

</p>
<p>Equation (17.35) gives the time-dependent wave function, neglecting spreading. I
</p>
<p>should note that the expansion of k0 around k D k0 breaks down when Ek � V0.
In that case, dispersion leads to a wave packet that no longer propagates without
</p>
<p>distortion. A necessary condition to neglect this dispersion is k00� � 1, where � is
the width of the incident packet. This condition may not be sufficient, however, for
</p>
<p>certain types of wave packets and values of x.
</p>
<p>I look at each term in Eq. (17.35) separately and remember that the original wave
</p>
<p>packet is centered at x D �x0 &lt; 0 at t D 0. I consider only those times t � x0=v0,

<p>The calculation proceeds as before, except that there are a few wrinkles. You might
</p>
<p>think that all that is necessary is to replace k0 by i� and k00 by i�0 but you would be
wrong on two counts. First, for x &gt; 0, the major contribution to the integral over k
</p>
<p>may no longer be centered at k D k0, even though ˆ.k/ is peaked at k D k0. The
reason for this is that the eigenfunction for x &gt; 0 is an exponentially decreasing
</p>
<p>function of �x D
q
</p>
<p>k2b � k2x, so it is possible to get a relatively larger contribution
to the integral over k near k D kb rather than k D k0. In general, the integral in
Eq. (17.51) must be done numerically for x &gt; 0:On the other hand, for the scattering
</p>
<p>problem I am interested in calculating the wave function only when t� t0 D x0=v0,
times for which the wave function in the region x &gt; 0 is negligibly small. Thus I
</p>
<p>neglect the region x &gt; 0 in my analysis of the problem, at least for the moment.</p>

<p>The delay is proportional to &bdquo;&mdash;this is a quantum effect. How can we interpret
this time delay? In the stationary state approach to the scattering problem, the

<p>probability current density vanishes for x &gt; 0. In the wave packet approach,
</p>
<p>however, it cannot vanish at all times. There must be a positive probability current

<p>density up until the time the center of the wave packet reaches the step and a negative
</p>
<p>probability current density as the (time delayed) wave packet is reflected. It is as if
</p>
<p>the packet is checking out the potential barrier and then decides it does not have

<p>enough energy to be transmitted so it goes back from whence it came, but it takes a

</p>
<p>Similar analyses can be used for different potentials. I will describe in qualitative
</p>
<p>terms what happens in each of the cases shown in Fig. 17.5.
</p>
<p>Cases (a) and (b) are analogous to an optical field incident normally on a thin
</p>
<p>dielectric film. There is constructive interference in reflection when twice the film
</p>
<p>thickness, 2d, is a half integral number of wavelengths and destructive interference
</p>
<p>when it is an integral number of wavelengths. The transmission goes to unity
</p>
<p>at positions of destructive interference in reflection. The resonances can be very
</p>
<p>narrow if the index of refraction is high. In the quantum-mechanical problem, you
</p>
<p>can also have very narrow transmission resonances as a function of k00d. In the
scattering problem, such resonances are accompanied by large time delays. To avoid
</p>
<p>wave packet spreading and to see these resonances, you must take the width of
</p>
<p>the initial wave packet to be much larger than the barrier width, multiplied by the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17.3 Summary 405
</p>
<p>number of &ldquo;bounces&rdquo; the packet makes in the region of the potential. The number
</p>
<p>of &ldquo;bounces&rdquo; is simply the barrier width d divided by v00td.
In case (c), there can be quantum-mechanical tunneling through the barrier. There
</p>
<p>is also a time delay in this problem, but no resonance phenomena. The wave function
</p>
<p>simply builds up and decays inside the barrier.
</p>
<p>Case (d) is perhaps the most interesting. It corresponds to a Fabry-Perot filter
</p>
<p>for light. If each barrier has a very small transmission coefficient separately,
</p>
<p>the transmission coefficient for the double barrier can approach unity when the
</p>
<p>incoming wavelength corresponds to a standing wave pattern between the two
</p>
<p>barriers! This is the result found from the steady-state approach. How can this be?
</p>
<p>How can the wave penetrate significantly through the first barrier since it doesn&rsquo;t
</p>
<p>even know about the second barrier? The answer to this question is &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t&rdquo; if the
</p>
<p>width of the packet is much less than a, the separation of the barriers. In that case,
</p>
<p>the wave packet is partially transmitted by the barrier, but mostly reflected by it.
</p>
<p>The part that is transmitted bounces back and forth between the barriers, leaking
</p>
<p>out a little bit each time. Thus, the transmitted wave is a series of packets, as is the
</p>
<p>reflected wave, with the time between reflected or transmitted packets equal to the
</p>
<p>round-trip time in the cavity.
</p>
<p>How then does a Fabry-Perot filter work? In order to see the narrow resonances,
</p>
<p>you must choose an initial wave packet that is much larger than the distance a
</p>
<p>between the barriers, multiplied by number of bounces in the cavity, a/.v0td/, which
</p>
<p>can be enormous. The time delay near resonance is inversely proportional to the
</p>
<p>transmission coefficient for a single barrier. In other words, you need an incoming
</p>
<p>packet that is quasi-monochromatic to see the narrow resonances. Part of the packet
</p>
<p>penetrates through the barrier, is reflected from the second barrier, and interferes
</p>
<p>with subsequent transmission through the barrier. After a long time, a steady state
</p>
<p>standing wave pattern is formed in the cavity having an intensity that is much larger
</p>
<p>than that of the incident wave&mdash;the part that leaks out the other end has an intensity
</p>
<p>equal to the initial wave intensity. After very long times, the initial wave packet can
</p>
<p>be almost totally transmitted by the double barrier.
</p>
<p>17.3 Summary
</p>
<p>We have seen several interesting features of scattering from one-dimensional
</p>
<p>potentials. Both steady-state and time-dependent approaches were used. In some
</p>
<p>sense, the time-dependent approach provides a justification for the equations
</p>
<p>for the reflection and transmission coefficients used in the steady-state approach
</p>
<p>and provides a prescription for obtaining the time delay from the phase of the
</p>
<p>steady-state eigenfunctions. I now turn my attention to scattering from spherically
</p>
<p>symmetric potentials.</p>

<p>1. How does one-dimensional scattering by a step potential differ for classical
</p>
<p>and quantum-mechanical scattering of a particle? What is the optical analogue of
</p>
<p>scattering by an attractive square well? Why would you expect resonances in this
</p>
<p>case?
</p>
<p>2. In the time-dependent scattering approach I assumed that a wave packet with a
</p>
<p>fairly well-defined energy was incident on the potential step from the left. If the
</p>
<p>energy is greater than the step height, there could be contributions to the wave
</p>
<p>function from the eigenfunctions given in Eq. (17.2b). Prove that such contributions

<p>Scattering: 3-D
</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the intricacies of quantum-mechanical scattering, you have
</p>
<p>to know something about classical scattering. When two particles collide and
</p>
<p>undergo elastic scattering, both the classical and quantum scattering problems can
</p>
<p>be very difficult to solve. The first step in the analysis of this problem is to make a
</p>
<p>transformation to the center-of-mass frame of the two particles. Then the interaction
</p>
<p>can be reduced to the scattering of a particle having reduced mass � from a
</p>
<p>center of potential having relative coordinate r. One calculates the scattering in the
</p>
<p>center-of-mass frame and then must transform back to laboratory coordinates. I will
</p>
<p>discuss only the problem of scattering in the center-of-mass frame or, equivalently,
</p>
<p>scattering of a particle having mass � from a potential V.r/ that is assumed to
</p>
<p>possess spherical symmetry. The particle is incident along the z axis and has
</p>
<p>energy E.
</p>
<p>18.1 Classical Scattering
</p>
<p>Let me first review classical scattering, indicated schematically in Fig. 18.1.
</p>
<p>The scattering depends on the impact parameter b and energy E of the incoming
</p>
<p>particle, as well as on the nature of V.r/. If the particle has initial speed

<p>Remember that

<p>L D
p
2�EbI (18.21)
</p>
<p>for a given energy, specifying the angular momentum is equivalent to specifying the
</p>
<p>impact parameter. Using the effective potential for scattering problems is a little
</p>
<p>different than using it for bound state problems, as I did in Chap. 10. In bound state
</p>
<p>problems, the radial motion is restricted between a minimum and maximum radius.
</p>
<p>In scattering problems, however, the particle is incident from r D 1, enters the
scattering region, reaches a minimum radial distance r D rmin, and then exits the
scattering region with its radial distance again approaching r D 1 as t � 1:
Remember that the effective potential is for the radial motion only and does not
</p>
<p>give a complete description of the orbit. At r D rmin, Pr D 0 and all contributions to
the kinetic energy of the particle come from the angular motion.
</p>
<p>Let us first look at the case where there is no potential. Of course, there is no
</p>
<p>preferred origin in this problem, but we can pick one at random. For a free particle
</p>
<p>the path is a straight line having impact parameter b relative to the origin, as shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 18.4. However, relative to this arbitrarily chosen origin, the particle has both a
</p>
<p>radial and angular contribution to its kinetic energy if L &curren; 0 (both the radial distance
and polar angle of the particle vary during its motion). The effective potential for a

<p>particle is less than the maximum height V0 of the potential. In this case, for b D 0
(L D 0) the particle is repelled by the potential and goes back along its original
direction, &sbquo; D � . With increasing impact parameter b, the strength of the potential
and the scattering angle decreases monotonically, ultimately reaching zero when the

</p>
<p>of b are shown in Fig. 18.5. For a given impact parameter b &lt; rmax the deflection
</p>
<p>angle decreases with increasing energy, as would be expected.
</p>
<p>The scattering is more interesting when the energy is greater than the maximum
</p>
<p>of the potential energy (see Fig. 18.6). In this case, for b D 0 (L D 0) the particle
slows down when it reaches the potential, passes through the origin, and speeds
</p>
<p>up as it leaves the potential; the deflection angle is &sbquo; D 0. But the scattering
angle must also go to zero when the impact parameter is larger than the range
</p>
<p>rmax of the potential. As a consequence, the scattering angle must pass through a
</p>
<p>maximum. A graph of &sbquo; as a function of b is shown in Fig. 18.6. Since d&sbquo;=db D 0
at some scattering angle, the differential scattering cross section becomes infinite at
</p>
<p>this impact parameter, analogous to rainbow scattering (actually rainbow scattering
</p>
<p>actually depends on the wave nature of light&mdash;see below).
</p>
<p>For attractive potentials new features appear in the scattering since the effective
</p>
<p>potential is no longer a monotonic function of r: I will assume that the potential falls
</p>
<p>off faster than 1=r2 for large r and that the potential is finite at r D 0: With these
restrictions, the effective potential for different values of angular momentum takes
</p>
<p>on the general structure indicated in Fig. 18.7. It is positive at r D 0 (except for
L D 0) and also positive as r!1 (except for L D 0). For sufficiently small values
of L D

</p>
<p>How is a particle scattered by such a potential? For impact parameter b D 0
(L D 0) the particle passes through the origin, &sbquo; D 0. The deflection angle also
goes to zero for large values of b, but from negative values, since the potential
</p>
<p>is attractive. For intermediate values of b, the nature of the scattering depends on
</p>
<p>the energy of the incoming particle. For an energy such as E1 shown in Fig. 18.7
</p>
<p>there is no value of the angular momentum for which the energy intersects the

corresponding to an energy such as E2 shown in Fig. 18.7. Orbiting occurs for b=a D 2:27
</p>
<p>On the other hand, for energies such as E2 in Fig. 18.7 there is always a value of
</p>
<p>angular momentum for which the energy intersects the effective potential at its local
</p>
<p>maximum. At this angular momentum or impact parameter, the particle approaches
</p>
<p>the radius r D b0 corresponding to the local maximum, but it takes an infinite time to
get there. This corresponds to orbiting and the deflection angle can take on infinitely
</p>
<p>many values an infinite number of times. Although the deflection angle diverges, the
</p>
<p>differential cross section is finite. In Fig. 18.9, the deflection angle &sbquo; is plotted as
</p>
<p>a function of b=a for the potential given by Eq. (18.24) with V0=E D 16. Near
b=a D 2:27; which corresponds to the impact parameter where dV.r/=dr D 0 for
this potential and energy, the deflection angle is greater than 12� , indicating that
</p>
<p>orbiting has occurred.1
</p>
<p>When orbiting occurs, there can be several impact parameters b &curren; 0 for which
�&sbquo;N is an even multiple of � (forward scattering) and for which �&sbquo;N is an odd
multiple of � (backscattering). Since the scattering angle � is equal to either 0 or �
</p>
<p>for these values of the deflection angle &sbquo;N , the differential scattering cross section,
</p>
<p>d�=d&#127; D jb= .sin �d�=db/j, become large or even infinite at such deflection angles
(depending on the value of d�=db at these points). This enhanced scattering is
</p>
<p>referred to as glory scattering. Road signs have a coating that gives rise to glory
</p>
<p>backscattering; the backscattering of light from water droplets is another example
</p>
<p>of the glory effect.
</p>
<p>Although I said that there is no longer a local maximum with increasing L for
</p>
<p>attractive potentials, there is an exception to this general result. For potentials having
</p>
<p>a sharp cutoff, such as the spherical well potential,
</p>
<p>1If you expand the square root in the denominator of Eq. (18.16) about r D rmin at the impact
parameter corresponding to orbiting, you will find it varies as .r � rmin/, giving a deflection
angle that diverges as ln Œ.r � rmin/ =a:&#141; Numerically, it is very hard to reproduce this very slow
divergence. There are very special values, V0=E D e2, B0=E D 4; rmin=a D
</p>
<p>p

<p>there is a sudden change of index of refraction at the air&ndash;water droplet interface,

<p>there are wave-like effects (just as the reflection coefficient at a potential step in

The scattering cross section can be thought to result from rays of light incident with

<p>parameter b is partially reflected and partially transmitted at the outer surface of the

<p>sphere. It then undergoes an infinite number of reflections (and transmissions) on the
</p>
<p>inner surface of the sphere. You can show using geometric optics that the deflection

For N D 1 the result is similar to that of classical scattering by a spherical well

to rainbows (where d&sbquo;N=db D 0/ or glories (values of �&sbquo;N that are an integral

the principal rainbow angle, corresponding to N D 2, occurs at &sbquo;N D �138ı or

</p>
<p>18.2 Quantum Scattering
</p>
<p>I now turn my attention to quantum scattering. This is a really important problem,
</p>
<p>since many experiments must be analyzed in terms of the differential cross sections
</p>
<p>associated with the scattering process. It is clear that quantum effects become
</p>
<p>important as soon as the scattering potential varies significantly over distances of
</p>
<p>a de Broglie wavelength of the incident particle (wave). If there is a sharp change
</p>
<p>in the potential, such as in hard sphere scattering, there are always diffraction
</p>
<p>effects. In this limit, no matter what the energy of the incident particle, there is a
</p>
<p>&ldquo;wave-like&rdquo; contribution to the scattering. We have already seen such effects in the
</p>
<p>scattering of a wave packet from a one-dimensional potential barrier or well. Aside
</p>
<p>from the sharp cutoff effects, there can be additional quantum effects when the de
</p>
<p>Broglie wavelength of the incident particle is comparable to distances over which
</p>
<p>the potential changes. Thus, for low energy scattering, a quantum treatment is often</p>

<p>needed. The rainbow-like, orbiting, and glory effects that occur for fixed impact
</p>
<p>parameters in classical scattering are &ldquo;washed out&rdquo; in quantum scattering since it is
</p>
<p>not possible to specify both a precise impact parameter and scattering angle owing
</p>
<p>to the uncertainty principle, but analogous processes still occur. Moreover, we will
</p>
<p>see that tunneling also occurs in certain limits, leading to very sharp resonances in
</p>
<p>the scattering.
</p>
<p>Quantum-mechanical scattering represents a very complex problem in most
</p>
<p>cases. There are many books devoted to this subject. In this introductory presen-
</p>
<p>tation, I limit the discussion to scattering of structureless particles by spherically
</p>
<p>symmetric potentials. The use of the effective potential greatly aids the analysis
</p>
<p>of the problem. As for one-dimensional problems, the calculations can be given
</p>
<p>in terms of a steady-state or time-dependent approach. I will mention the time-
</p>
<p>dependent approach briefly, but concentrate on the steady-state approach. In both
</p>
<p>cases, the theory is based on the prediction (I will prove this later on) that the
</p>
<p>asymptotic form of the (unnormalized) eigenfunctions as r!1 is of the form
</p>
<p> k.r/ �
�
</p>
<p>eikz C fk.�/
eikr
</p>
<p>r
</p>
<p>�
: (18.31)
</p>
<p>The first term in Eq. (18.31) corresponds to a plane wave incident from the left in
</p>
<p>the positive z direction, while the second term corresponds to a spherically scattered
</p>
<p>wave that is weighted with the scattering amplitude fk.�/. Had I carried out a time-
</p>
<p>dependent treatment, I would find that an initial wave packet having spatial extent w
</p>
<p>in the z direction and propagating in the z direction is transformed into the original
</p>
<p>wave packet propagating as if no scattering occurred, plus an outgoing shell having
</p>
<p>thickness w that is centered at radius r D �z0Cv0t, where �z0 is the initial location
of the center of the packet and v0 is the average speed of the initial packet. The
</p>
<p>spherical shell is weighted by fk.�/. To arrive at this picture of the scattering, it
</p>
<p>is necessary to assume that the initial wave packet has a k-space amplitude ˆ.k/
</p>
<p>that is sharply peaked about k D k0uz and that the phase of fk.�/ is approximately
constant for values of k close to k0uz. If the phase is not constant, but is slowly
</p>
<p>varying, there is a time delay associated with the scattering process that can depend
</p>
<p>on the scattering angle. For more rapid variations of the phase, such as those that
</p>
<p>occur near resonances, the outgoing wave packet has a complicated structure owing
</p>
<p>to dispersion associated with the phase of the scattering amplitude.
</p>
<p>As in the 1-D case, I can get the differential scattering cross section by
</p>
<p>considering the probability current density in all but the forward direction (I return
</p>
<p>to what happens in the forward direction below). The incident probability current
</p>
<p>density is that associated with the eikz term in Eq. (18.31) and is equal to
</p>

</p>
<p>18.2.1 Method of Partial Waves
</p>
<p>In the classical problem, for a given energy, each incident impact parameter or
</p>
<p>value of the angular momentum is associated with a single scattering angle. In
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics this picture is no longer valid since it would imply that we
</p>
<p>could simultaneously specify both the position (impact parameter) and momentum
</p>
<p>(given by the scattering angle) of the particle. Nevertheless, it is possible to write
</p>
<p>the differential scattering amplitude as arising from contributions from each value
</p>
<p>of `, since ` is a conserved quantum number. This is the origin of the terminology,
</p>
<p>method of partial waves. Several (in principle, all) values of ` give rise to scattering
</p>
<p>at the same angle, and there can be interference among the various contributions.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is convenient to view the quantum-mechanical scattering as arising
</p>
<p>from contributions from different impact parameters.
</p>
<p>An uncertainty principle argument can also help you to understand why quantum
</p>
<p>total cross sections can be finite for infinite range potentials, whereas they are infi-
</p>
<p>nite in the corresponding classical case. The question is, when does the uncertainty
</p>
<p>principle lead to a breakdown of a classical approach. The uncertainty principle
</p>
<p>requires that the transverse momentum &#129;pt imparted to the particle by the potential
</p>
<p>multiplied by the impact parameter that gives rise to this scattering must be greater
</p>
<p>than or of order &bdquo;; that is
</p>
<p>b&#129;pt &amp; &bdquo;: (18.40)
</p>
<p>For a potential V varying as C=rs, the change in transverse momentum can be

<p>cross section for Coulomb scattering, which is actually the case, even quantum-
</p>
<p>mechanically. For potentials that fall off faster than 1=r as r ! 1 there is always
an effective maximum range of the potential given by rmax D bmax and an associated
diffractive scattering component in the differential scattering cross section that
</p>
<p>would arise from a potential having a sharp cut-off at r D rmax.
To apply the method of partial waves, I must solve the Schr&ouml;dinger equation
</p>
<p>exactly. This is no easy task, but at least I can solve it for large r. If I assume that
</p>
<p>the scattering potential falls off faster than 1=r2, the effective potential at large r is
</p>
<p>dominated by the angular momentum term&mdash;in other words, the effective potential
</p>
<p>is that of a free particle. I have considered free particle solutions in spherical
</p>
<p>coordinates in Chap. 10. The general solution for the radial wave function of a free
</p>
<p>particle for r &curren; 0 can be written as (see Appendix 1)

<p>from which the ı` can be extracted.
</p>
<p>Of course it is not easy to solve the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for most potentials. If
</p>
<p>you need only a few partial waves, then the method of partial waves is most useful.
</p>
<p>If the range of the potential is of order a, then impact parameters of order a are

<p>needed. That is

<p>Therefore, the partial wave expansion is especially useful when ka . 1. On the

equation using the WKB method and then extract the phase shifts. In this limit, the

<p>method of partial waves can also be used at high energies.

<p>This result now has a very simple physical interpretation. The incident wave (or
</p>
<p>wave packet) is scattered in all directions. In the forward direction the incident wave
</p>
<p>interferes with the scattered wave to reduce the probability current in the forward
</p>
<p>direction in precisely the amount that corresponds to scattering in all the other
</p>
<p>directions. In other words, the optical theorem is just a statement of conservation
</p>
<p>of probability.
</p>
<p>18.2.1.2 Interpretation of the Partial Wave Phases
</p>
<p>There is also a simple interpretation that can be given to the partial wave phases.

<p>�
[see Eqs. (18.50) and (18.55)]. Thus the partial wave phases are
</p>
<p>simply phase shifts in the asymptotic wave function produced by the potential. For
</p>
<p>example, for an infinitely repulsive hard sphere potential having radius a, the wave
</p>
<p>function is displaced from the origin. For ` D 0 it is displaced by a; giving rise to
a phase shift ı0 D �ka. For higher `, the shift depends on ` but is always negative.
Any purely repulsive potential always produces negative phase shifts, analogous to
</p>
<p>the fact that classical repulsive scattering always leads to positive deflection angles.
</p>
<p>For scattering by attractive potentials, new and interesting phenomena can occur.
</p>
<p>The phase shifts are positive, in general, because the wave function is pulled in
</p>
<p>by the potential, but for strong potentials the wave function can be pulled in so
</p>
<p>much that an extra oscillation occurs and gives rise to negative phase shifts of
</p>
<p>the type you would normally associate with a repulsive interaction. Although the
</p>
<p>deflection angle is negative for classical scattering by attractive potentials, deflection
</p>
<p>angles such as those satisfying �� &lt; &sbquo; &lt; �2� correspond to scattering that can
mimic that of a repulsive potential. It is often stated that the interatomic potential in
</p>
<p>Bose condensates is repulsive since repulsive interactions are needed to produce the
</p>
<p>condensates. Actually the true interaction is attractive, but the effective interaction
</p>
<p>is repulsive.
</p>
<p>There is another interpretation that can be given to the phase shifts that is valid for
</p>
<p>large energy and angular momenta. The radial wave equation for u`.r/ D rR`.r/ is

<p>many partial waves contribute to the scattering. One can convert the sum over
</p>
<p>` to an integral over impact parameters. For each impact parameter, there is a
</p>
<p>scattering angle that corresponds to the maximum contribution to the integral (point
</p>
<p>of stationary phase). In some sense, we recapture the classical limit in which
</p>
<p>scattering at a given impact parameter gives rise to scattering at a particular angle.
</p>
<p>The calculation is reminiscent of the Feynman path integral approach where the
</p>
<p>classical path makes the major contribution to an integral of the action between
</p>
<p>two fixed points. There is a difference from the classical case however, since
</p>
<p>contributions from different ` can interfere, giving rise to rapid oscillations in the
</p>
<p>differential cross section as a function of angle&mdash;it is only when these oscillations
</p>
<p>are assumed to average to zero (as would be the case if an experiment could not
</p>
<p>resolve the oscillations as a function of angle) does one recover the classical limit

<p>of the differential cross section.</p>

<p>For spherical barrier potentials, the dependence of the cross section on ˇ is
</p>
<p>somewhat boring (see problems) and need not be discussed.
</p>
<p>Spherical well potentials present a whole new story. There are values of ˇ for
</p>
<p>which ı0 D 0 and S wave scattering is totally suppressed&mdash;this is known as the
Ramsauer-Townsend effect. On the other hand, there are values of ˇ D .nC 1=2/�
for which bound states in the potential well occur near zero energy&mdash;the first such
</p>
<p>state occurs when ˇ D �=2: For these values of ˇ there is a resonance near x D
ka D 0 and the wave function &ldquo;bounces back and forth many times&rdquo; as it is scattered.
As a result the scattering cross section has a narrow, sharply peaked resonance as a
</p>
<p>function of ˇ for fixed x.
</p>
<p>These features are seen clearly in Figs. 18.17 and 18.18 where both the res-
</p>
<p>onances and Ramsauer-Townsend effect can be seen. Note that this does not
</p>
<p>necessarily imply there is a resonance in the cross section as a function of energy</p>

<p>second parameter called the effective range reff is also needed). This is a very general

<p>result for any type of low energy scattering. In other words, the specific form of the

<p>such effects as rainbow and glory scattering, although it may be necessary to go to

<p>values of x as large as 1000 to clearly see the rainbow effects.
</p>
<p>I need to consider three ranges of angular momenta values to get a qualitative
</p>
<p>understanding of the scattering. First consider ` &lt; ka which corresponds to impact
</p>
<p>parameters b &lt; a [see Fig. 18.20 with energy E3]. This is analogous to the situation
</p>
<p>in optics where a ray enters the dielectric sphere and undergoes internal reflections
</p>
<p>in the sphere. Both rainbow and glory scattering occur. You can almost &ldquo;see&rdquo; the
</p>
<p>result. If a &ldquo;particle&rdquo; comes in, it is reflected and transmitted at r D a; reaches a
point of closest approach r0 and then is transmitted and reflected on its way out at
</p>
<p>r D a. The wave that exits the sphere is the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; refracted wave, but that wave
is also reflected on the inner surface of the sphere and can emerge at some other
</p>
<p>direction and correspond to rainbow scattering for some incident impact parameter.
</p>
<p>Since an infinite number of reflections are possible, all scattering angles can occur
</p>
<p>and glory scattering occurs a well.

<p>For ` &gt; x1 D

very little scattering since b� a [see Fig. 18.20 with energy E1]. No tunneling into

<p>incident energy corresponds to the energy of the quasi-bound states in the effective

</p>
<p>course, the differential scattering cross section involves a sum over all values of `,
</p>
<p>so all three types of effects are present at once.
</p>

<p>for x D ka D ˇ D 5; 20; 100: There is a forward diffraction peak as in scattering by

for this value of the effective index of refraction, neff D

</p>
<p>is predicted to be � � 2:6 rad; the peak at this value in the ka D 100 graph,
which sharpens with increasing ka, may be an indication that rainbow scattering
</p>
<p>is occurring. The oscillations in the graph correspond to interference effects arising
</p>
<p>from contributions from different ` to scattering at a given angle.
</p>
<p>The classical differential cross section, given in Eq. (18.28) with n D neff Dp
1C V0=E, is also plotted in Figs. 18.21, 18.22 and 18.23 as the dashed curves.
</p>
<p>The classical cross section does not have a forward diffraction peak, but otherwise is
</p>
<p>in good agreement with the quantum distribution, averaged over oscillations, in the

</p>
<p>For potentials requiring numerical solutions, the method of partial waves is espe-
</p>
<p>cially useful in the low energy scattering limit, when only a few partial waves are
</p>
<p>needed. It would be good to have a result that is valid in the high energy limit,
</p>
<p>other than the WKB partial wave result. The Born series provides such a solution to
</p>
<p>this problem. The Born series is effectively a perturbative approach, valid when the
</p>
<p>scattering cross section can be expanded in a power series in the potential.
</p>
<p>To derive the Born series, I start from the Schr&ouml;dinger equation written in the
</p>
<p>form
</p>
<p>r2 C k2 D U.r/ ; (18.119)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>U.r/ D 2�&bdquo;2 V.r/: (18.120)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.2 Quantum Scattering 447
</p>
<p>The idea is to treat the right-hand side as a perturbation. I look for a solution to this
</p>
<p>equation in the form
</p>
<p> k.r/ D eik�r �
1
</p>
<p>4�
</p>
<p>Z
dr0G.r � r0/U.r0/ .r0/; (18.121)
</p>
<p>substitute it into Eq. (18.119) and find that, for this to be a solution, I must require
</p>
<p>that
</p>
<p>�
r2 C k2
</p>
<p>�
G.r � r0/ D �4�ı.r � r0/: (18.122)
</p>
<p>The quantity G.r � r0/ is known as a Green function. It is not difficult to verify by
direct substitution that
</p>
<p>G.r � r0/ D e
˙ikjr�r0j
</p>
<p>jr � r0j (18.123)
</p>
<p>is a solution of Eq. (18.122). Which sign in the exponent to take depends on the
</p>
<p>physics. If the scattering is to correspond to outgoing spherical waves, the positive
</p>
<p>sign must be taken.
</p>
<p>Thus, the formal solution for  k.r/, obtained from Eqs. (18.121) and (18.123), is
</p>
<p> k.r/ D eik�r �
1
</p>

<p>jr � r0jU.r

</p>
<p>0/: (18.124)
</p>
<p>It looks like I haven&rsquo;t accomplished anything but to go from a differential to an
</p>
<p>integral equation. However, this is precisely the form that is useful for an iterative
</p>
<p>or perturbation series solution in powers of U.r/. In other words, to zeroth order
</p>

</p>
<p>which is known as the first Born approximation. You can continue iterating the
</p>
<p>solution to obtain the Born series as a power series in the potential, but it is usually
</p>
<p>difficult to go beyond the first term. The first Born approximation is the most
</p>
<p>important result in high energy scattering.
</p>
<p>To get the scattering amplitude, I must compare Eq. (18.126) in the limit r!1
with Eq. (18.31). To do so, I take the z axis along k, and expand

</p>
<p>It is difficult to give a rigorous estimate of the corrections to the first Born
</p>
<p>approximation. Sometimes the Born approximation is used without justification
</p>
<p>since it is the only simple calculation that can be carried out. By looking at the
</p>
<p>second order term in the Born series and evaluating the terms in the integrand at
</p>
<p>r D 0, one can estimate that the first Born approximation is valid if

</p>
<p>If there is some effective range a0 to the potential and if the maximum of the

</p>
<p>Looking at Eq. (18.137b), you see that the first Born approximation is generally
</p>
<p>valid for high energy scattering, ka0 � 1. It can be valid even for low energy
scattering if ˇ2 D 2�V0a20=&bdquo;2 � 1; that is, for values of the strength ˇ that
are sufficiently small to insure that no bound states could exist in the case of an
</p>
<p>attractive potential. In fact, since condition (18.137a) is generally satisfied when
</p>
<p>condition (18.137b) holds, a sufficient condition for the Born series to converge
</p>
<p>is that � jV.r/j is not strong enough to support a bound state (along with the
additional requirements that both

<p>R1

Although conditions (18.137) are sufficient, they may not be necessary for validity

<p>18.3 Summary
</p>
<p>I have given a rather detailed discussion of elementary quantum scattering theory,
</p>
<p>trying to emphasize the underlying physics. To facilitate the discussion, I reviewed
</p>
<p>aspects of classical scattering of particles and electromagnetic radiation, since many
</p>
<p>features encountered in classical scattering, such as rainbows and glories, resurface
</p>
<p>in quantum scattering theory. There are two different methods that can be used to
</p>
<p>solve the quantum scattering problem. The method of partial waves is especially
</p>
<p>useful for low energy scattering while the Born approximation is basically a high
</p>
<p>energy, perturbative approach. Scattering by various potentials was considered and
</p>
<p>different types of resonance phenomena were explored, as were diffractive effects
</p>
<p>associated with sharp changes in the scattering potential.
</p>
<p>18.4 Appendix A: Free Particle Solution in Spherical
</p>
<p>Coordinates
</p>
<p>For a free particle, we know that the (unnormalized) eigenfunctions are simply
</p>
<p> k.r/ D eik�r; (18.153)
</p>
<p>where k2 D 2�E=&bdquo;2. Why should we go the trouble of solving this in spherical
coordinates when there is no natural origin to the problem? The reason for this is
</p>
<p>that, although the particle is not free in the scattering problem, the functional form
</p>
<p>of the eigenfunctions for the region r &gt; rmax is the same as that of a free particle,
</p>
<p>provided the potential vanishes for r &gt; rmax.
</p>
<p>To solve the free particle problem in spherical coordinates, I recall, that for any
</p>
<p>spherically symmetric potential, the eigenfunctions have the form

<p>3. Outline the procedures that are used for solving a scattering problem using the
</p>
<p>method of partial waves and using the Born approximation. In general, when is each

<p>method most useful? Are there cases where only the ` D 0 partial wave contributes,
yet the first Born approximation gives a result that agrees with ` D 0 scattering?
Explain. Why can&rsquo;t the Born approximation give a good result for hard sphere

<p>Symmetry and Transformations: Rotation
Matrices
</p>
<p>Now that I have looked at approximation techniques and scattering theory, I return
</p>
<p>to some more formal aspects of quantum mechanics. I begin with a discussion
</p>
<p>of symmetry and see how this leads to a somewhat more sophisticated picture of
</p>
<p>angular momentum. We have seen already that energy degeneracy arises in problems
</p>
<p>for which there is an associated symmetry. Moreover, in most of these cases, there
</p>
<p>is also a conserved dynamic variable that was connected with the symmetry (e.g.,
</p>
<p>in central field potentials, angular momentum is conserved and the potential is
</p>
<p>spherically symmetric).
</p>
<p>Symmetry is central to modern physics. When you learn about the standard
</p>
<p>model of particle physics, you will see the critical role symmetry plays in the classi-
</p>
<p>fication of particles and forces. Even in elementary quantum mechanics, symmetry
</p>
<p>considerations are important. I will try to give you a very brief introduction to this
</p>
<p>topic. I might say from the outset that I often encounter sign problems in considering
</p>
<p>either active or passive transformations, but I have learned to live with it. I need to
</p>
<p>consider transformations of coordinates, vectors, scalar functions, vector functions,
</p>
<p>and operators. These quantities transform differently under symmetry operations.
</p>
<p>Before applying the ideas of symmetry operations to quantum mechanics, I review
</p>
<p>what happens to coordinates, vectors, and functions under translation and rotation.
</p>
<p>19.1 Active Versus Passive Transformations
</p>
<p>In general, it is possible to define scalar, vector, and tensor operators by their
</p>
<p>transformation properties under a given symmetry operation such as translation or
</p>
<p>rotation. To make matters confusing, one can look at changes from either a passive
</p>
<p>(coordinate axes change) or an active (axes remain fixed, but vectors and functions
</p>
<p>are transformed) point of view. I will review these concepts for translation in one-
</p>
<p>dimension and rotations in both two and three dimensions. The study of translations

</p>
<p>Fig. 19.1 Passive transformation of the coordinate axis to the left by a units. A point that has
</p>
<p>coordinate xold in the original coordinate system has xnew D x C a in the new coordinate system.
The upper axis in the figure is the translated one
</p>
<p>and rotations is important from a practical standpoint. For example, if you need to
</p>
<p>average collision cross sections over different orientations of the colliding particles,
</p>
<p>you can calculate the result for a given orientation of the colliding particles and then
</p>
<p>use rotation matrices to transform the result to account for arbitrary orientations.
</p>
<p>19.1.1 Passive and Active Translations
</p>
<p>19.1.1.1 Passive Translation
</p>
<p>In a passive translation of the coordinate system the coordinate axes are translated.
</p>
<p>Imagine that the x-axis in Fig. 19.1 is translated a units to the left. If I label the
</p>
<p>coordinate of a point in the original coordinate system by xold and in the new
</p>
<p>coordinate system by xnew, then xnew D xold C a. I define a translation operator
OTP.�a/ for a passive transformation to the left by a units as one that changes the
coordinate of a point from xold to xnew according to
</p>
<p>xnew D OTP.�a/xold D xold C a: (19.1)
</p>
<p>Under this passive transformation, functions f .x/ are not translated; however,
</p>
<p>since the coordinate axis is translated, the functional form of f .x/ changes. The new
</p>
<p>functional form is denoted by fP .xI �a/, where the minus sign is associated with a
translation of the coordinate axis to the left. Since the value of the function at a fixed
</p>
<p>point in space is unchanged, the relationship between fP .xI �a/ and f .x/ is given by

<p>function fP under translation.
</p>
<p>19.1.1.2 Active Translation
</p>
<p>I define an active translation OTA.a/ of a function to the right by a units as producing
the same function I would get by translating the axis by a units to the left in a passive
</p>
<p>transformation (see Fig. 19.2), that is,
</p>
<p>fA.xI a/ D OTA.a/f .x/ D fP .xI �a/ D f
h�
OTP.a/
</p>
<p>�
x
i
D f .x � a/ : (19.4)
</p>
<p>If the original function was centered at x D 0, the transformed function is centered
at x D a. A translation of the function to the right is equivalent to a transformation
of the coordinate axis to the left. Note that the passive transformation acts on
</p>
<p>coordinates while the active transformation acts on functions. In other words, OTA.a/
translates functions to the right by a units while OTP.a/ translates the coordinate axis
to the right by a units.

<p>Consider a rotation of the coordinate axes in which the position vector r remains
</p>
<p>fixed. The axes are rotated by an angle �� (see Fig. 19.3) about the z-axis. The unit
vectors are denoted by u1 D ux, u2 D uy. Under the rotation, coordinates of the
position vector change (even though the vector remains fixed in space) according to</p>

</p>
<p>To specify a rotation in three dimensions, I need to specify the axis of rotation

</p>
<p>19.2 Quantum Mechanics
</p>
<p>All these ideas can now be taken over to quantum mechanics. In fact we can
</p>
<p>use our understanding of the physics associated with Hamiltonians for the free
</p>
<p>particle and spherically symmetric potentials to obtain expressions for operators
</p>
<p>such as the translation and rotation operators. To this point, I have defined these
</p>
<p>operators only implicitly through Eqs. (19.4) and (19.11), in terms of their actions
</p>
<p>on functions.
</p>
<p>Before starting any formalism, it might be helpful to remind you of what
</p>
<p>you already know about symmetry operations. For the moment I consider only
</p>
<p>continuous symmetry operations such as translation or rotation, but will discuss
</p>
<p>discrete symmetry operations as well. So what do you know?
</p>
<p>1. If an operator commutes with the Hamiltonian, the expectation value of the
</p>
<p>physical observable associated with that operator is a constant of the motion.
</p>
<p>2. If an operator OA commutes with a Hamiltonian OH, and if jEi is an eigenket of
OH with eigenenergy E, then OA jEi is also an eigenket of OH with eigenenergy E:
We are guaranteed that OA jEi is equal to a constant times jEi only if there is no
degeneracy in the eigenenergies of OH. When there is degeneracy, OA jEi is not
necessarily equal to a constant times jEi, this implies that there can be more
than one eigenket with the same energy&mdash;when an operator commutes with the
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian, there is often energy degeneracy.
</p>
<p>3. An operator OA acting on an eigenket jEi of a given Hamiltonian OH produces
a new ket jEi0, in general, that is not necessarily an eigenket of OH. Suppose
that OA corresponds to a symmetry operation such as a translation or rotation in
Hilbert space. If the Hamiltonian OH is invariant under this symmetry operation,
the eigenenergy of the transformed state jEi0 cannot change; it must also be an
eigenket of OH. Since jEi0 &curren; jEi, in general, this again implies some energy
degeneracy.
</p>
<p>4. Combining these ideas, we see that if a Hamiltonian is invariant under some
</p>
<p>symmetry operation, there is associated with the symmetry operation a Hermitian
</p>
<p>operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian. As you will see, the operator is a
</p>
<p>generator of infinitesimal transformations on the wave function or eigenkets that
</p>
<p>leave the Hamiltonian invariant.
</p>
<p>A simple example will serve to illustrate these ideas. Let us look at the case of a
</p>
<p>free particle having mass m in one-dimension for which the Hamiltonian is
</p>
<p>OH D Op
2
</p>
<p>2m
(19.26)
</p>
<p>where Op D �i&bdquo;d=dx. The (unnormalized) eigenfunctions can be taken as
</p>
<p> k.x/ D e˙ikx (19.27)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

<p>with
</p>
<p>k D
r
2mE
</p>
<p>&bdquo;2 &gt; 0: (19.28)
</p>
<p>Equally well, the eigenfunctions can be taken as
</p>
<p> k.x/ D cos .kx/ I sin .kx/ : (19.29)
</p>
<p>The eigenfunctions are two-fold degenerate.
</p>
<p>How is all this related to the momentum operator? Since
h
Op; OH
</p>
<p>i
D 0, if  k.x/ is
</p>
<p>an eigenfunction, then Op k.x/ is also an eigenfunction having the same energy. If I
take eikx as an eigenfunction, then Op k.x/ D &bdquo;keikx, which is the same eigenfunction.
That is, if I use the simultaneous eigenfunctions of Op and OH, I do not generate a new
eigenfunction by applying Op to an eigenfunction. On the other hand, if I choose
cos .kx/ as an eigenfunction of OH then Op k.x/ D i&bdquo;k sin .kx/. It generates a new
eigenfunction with the same energy, demonstrating the energy degeneracy.
</p>
<p>19.2.1 Translation Operator
</p>
<p>Since the momentum operator commutes with the Hamiltonian and since the
</p>
<p>free particle Hamiltonian is invariant under translation, we might expect that the
</p>
<p>momentum operator is somehow connected with the translation operator in quantum
</p>
<p>mechanics. To demonstrate that this is indeed the case, I start by considering an
</p>
<p>infinitesimal displacement � of an arbitrary wave function  .x/, for which
</p>
<p> .x � �/ �

</p>
<p>can build up a finite translation a by taking N infinitesimal translations, each having
</p>
<p>� D a=N, and then take the limit as N !1. In this manner I obtain

</p>
<p>If the momentum operator commutes with the Hamiltonian, then the Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>is invariant under translation, OT.a/ OH OT&#142;.a/ D OH: This is a general result, continuous
operators that commute with a Hamiltonian are the generators of infinitesimal
</p>
<p>transformations under which the Hamiltonian remains invariant. In this case,
</p>
<p>the momentum operator generates infinitesimal translations. By looking at the
</p>
<p>infinitesimal transformations that are generated by operators that commute with
</p>
<p>the Hamiltonian, we can determine the symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian!
</p>
<p>The situation is a bit different for discrete operators such as the parity operator
</p>
<p>defined by
</p>
<p>OP .x/ D  .�x/: (19.38)
</p>
<p>There can be no infinitesimal transformations associated with a discrete operator of
</p>
<p>this form. On the other hand, if an operator commutes with the parity operator, this
</p>
<p>could imply degeneracy. You can see this if you choose the eigenfunctions of the
</p>
<p>free particle Hamiltonian that are not eigenfunctions of the parity operator, namely
</p>
<p>e˙ikx. Clearly,
</p>
<p>OPeikx D e�ikx (19.39)
</p>
<p>produces a new eigenfunction with the same energy. Other discrete operators of
</p>
<p>importance are the time-reversal operator and the charge-conjugation operator (see
</p>
<p>problems). All physical processes are believed to be invariant under the product of
</p>
<p>the parity, charge-conjugation, and time-reversal operators (CPT theorem).
</p>
<p>19.2.2 Rotation Operator
</p>
<p>Now let us consider a Hamiltonian with a spherically symmetric potential. You
</p>
<p>know that the angular momentum operator commutes with this Hamiltonian so you
</p>
<p>can see what type of infinitesimal transformation it generates. Of course, you can
</p>
<p>probably guess that it will produce a rotation since the Hamiltonian is invariant

<p>Imagine there is an operator OA such that

</p>
<p>Under a unitary transformation OU that transforms the wave function as
</p>
<p> u.r/ D OU .r/; (19.74)
</p>
<p>Eq. (19.73) is transformed into
</p>
<p> 2u.r/ D OU 2.r/ D OU OA 1.r/ D OU OA OU&#142; 2.r/ D OAu 2.r/; (19.75)
</p>
<p>where OAu is the transformed operator and I have used the fact that OU&#142; OU D O1. Thus,
under translation, an operator OA is transformed into
</p>
<p>OAT D OT OA OT&#142;; (19.76)</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>19.3 Rotations: Examples 479
</p>
<p>while under rotation it is transformed into
</p>
<p>OAR D OR OA OR&#142;: (19.77)
</p>
<p>It can be a bit confusing when one encounters a Hamiltonian of the form OH D ˛Or�
E; where ˛ is a constant and E is a (classical) electric field. Although conventional
</p>
<p>vectors are transformed under rotation, in quantum mechanics the only quantities
</p>
<p>that are transformed under rotation (and any other symmetry operation, for that
</p>
<p>matter) are quantum-mechanical operators. That is, under rotation, OHR D ˛OrR � E,
where OrR D OROr OR&#142;, only the operator is transformed. The electric field appearing in
the Hamiltonian is taken to be an external field (not an operator) and is unaffected
</p>
<p>by the transformation. You can expand your quantum system to include the electric
</p>
<p>field (it is no longer an external field in this case), but to do so you must quantize
</p>
<p>the field. Once the field is quantized, the electric field becomes an operator that is
</p>
<p>also transformed under rotation.

<p>480 19 Symmetry and Transformations: Rotation Matrices
</p>
<p>19.3.1 Rotation Matrix
</p>
<p>I start with the rotation matrix, Eq. (19.78). The rotation matrix tells you how the
</p>
<p>coordinates of a vector change under an active rotation of the vector. Remember in
</p>
<p>an active rotation the axes remain fixed and the vector is rotated, first by &#13; about the
</p>
<p>z axis, then by ˇ around the y axis, and finally by ˛ around the z axis. For example,
</p>
<p>the rotation .˛ D 0; ˇ D ��=2; &#13; D 0/ rotates a unit vector f D ux along the x axis
into one along the z axis and I find accordingly

<p>for this is that the rotation matrices I am using are called proper rotations (having
</p>
<p>determinant C1), since they can be generated continuously from the unit matrix.
The improper rotation matrices form another whole set of rotation matrices having
</p>
<p>determinant �1; that cannot be generated from the identity. Since there are two
ways of generating rotations in this fashion, the rotation group (groups are discussed
</p>
<p>briefly in the following chapter) is not simply connected.</p>

<p>19.3.2 Rotation Operator
</p>
<p>Now let me move on to the rotation operator. The rotation operator acts on state
</p>
<p>vectors or wave functions. In general you would expect the result to be very
</p>
<p>complicated since
</p>
<p>OR .˛; ˇ; &#13;/  .r/ D e� i&bdquo; ˛ OLz e� i&bdquo;ˇ OLy e� i&bdquo; &#13; OLz .r/ (19.86)
</p>
<p>appears very difficult to evaluate. However, if you remember that the wave function
</p>
<p>is a scalar, then
</p>
<p> .r/R D OR .˛; ˇ; &#13;/ .r/ D  ŒR
&macr;
.˛; ˇ; &#13;/�1 r&#141;; (19.87)
</p>
<p>where R
&macr;
.˛; ˇ; &#13;/�1 is just the transpose of the (active) rotation matrix.
</p>
<p>As an example, let us see how the spherical harmonic Y01 .�; �/ is transformed
</p>
<p>under a rotation of��=2 about the y-axis, for which the Euler angles are .˛; ˇ; &#13;/ D
.0;��=2; 0/. The transformed function is
</p>
<p>Y01 .�; �/R D Y01 .x; y; z/R D R

</p>
<p>(19.88)
</p>
<p>Recall that the spherical coordinates can be considered to be functions of x, y, and
</p>
<p>z. This looks a bit complicated, but using Eq. (19.87), I find
</p>
<p>Y01 .x; y; z/R D e

<p>19.4 Summary
</p>
<p>In this chapter, a brief introduction was given of the role played by transformations
</p>
<p>and symmetry in quantum mechanics. The interplay between degeneracy, symmetry,
</p>
<p>and operators that commute with the Hamiltonian was elaborated. It was shown that
</p>
<p>the operators associated with conserved physical quantities can be used to generate
</p>
<p>transformations on the eigenfunctions that leave the Hamiltonian invariant. The
</p>
<p>transformations of the eigenfunctions and eigenkets under translation and rotation
</p>
<p>were derived. It was shown that the transformations of the eigenkets under rotation
</p>
<p>matrices could be expressed in terms of the rotation matrices, whose elements,
</p>
<p>D
.`/
</p>
<p>m0m
.˛; ˇ; &#13;/, are simply matrix elements of the rotation operator in the j`mi basis.

</p>
<p>Now that we have seen how wave functions and state vectors are changed under
</p>
<p>symmetry operations, it is natural to ask how operators are transformed under the
</p>
<p>same operations. To do so, however, requires a slight digression. I first need to
</p>
<p>discuss the way in which angular momenta are coupled in quantum mechanics.
</p>
<p>I have already introduced the concept of coupling of orbital and spin angular
</p>
<p>momentum in Chap. 12, but want to generalize this to the coupling of any two
</p>
<p>angular momenta. For the moment let us consider two, non-interacting quantum
</p>
<p>systems having total angular momentum operator OJ1 associated with system 1 and
total angular momentum operator OJ2 associated with system 2. Since the systems are
non-interacting, the operators OJ1 and OJ2 commute and an eigenket for the combined
system can be written as
</p>
<p>jj1; j2Im1;m2i D jj1;m1i jj2;m2i (20.1)
</p>
<p>which is a simultaneous eigenstate of the operators OJ21 ; OJ22 ; OJ1z; OJ2z.

<p>the components of OJ satisfy the usual commutation laws for angular momenta. As
a consequence, a simultaneous eigenket of OJ21 ; OJ22 ; OJ2, and OJz can also be written as
jj1; j2I j;mi,where j and m are the quantum numbers associated with OJ2 and OJz. I want
to relate the jj1; j2I j;mi eigenkets to the jj1;m1i jj2;m2i eigenkets.
</p>
<p>In effect, I need to see how the matrix elements of the sum operator, OJ D OJ1C OJ2,
is related to those of the individual operators OJ1 and OJ2. Classically, you know how
to add two vectors J1 and J2 to get the sum vector J D J1CJ2. You can prove easily
that
</p>
<p>jJ1 � J2j � jJ1 C J2j � J1 C J2: (20.4)
</p>
<p>Quantum-mechanically, we will find a similar condition. Classically, you can ask,
</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many ways can we combine J1 C J2 to a given total value J&lsaquo;&rdquo; Clearly the z
components must add, J1zCJ2z D Jz. But even with this restriction there is an infinite
number of ways to add the vectors together, provided they satisfy condition (20.4)
</p>
<p>with the &lt; rather than � signs. [To see this, draw a triangle J1 C J2 D J in a plane.
You can now rotate J2 around J1 keeping the angle between J1 and J2 constant.
</p>
<p>For each angle of rotation, J1 C J2 D J:] At the extreme values, there is only one
way to sum the vectors since they must be aligned. In quantum mechanics, there is
</p>
<p>also only one way to sum the vectors at the extreme values; however, for other than
</p>
<p>extreme values of J, there is always a finite rather than infinite number of ways to
</p>
<p>add the vectors to get the final vector, since angular momentum is quantized.
</p>
<p>To relate the two bases I write

</p>
<p>The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are very important in calculating transition
</p>
<p>rates. Often we look at transitions between two manifolds of atomic levels, each
</p>
<p>containing a number of magnetic sublevels (corresponding to different values of m).
</p>
<p>The ratio of the various transition rates between levels having different m&rsquo;s is equal
</p>
<p>to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients associated with the transition rates.
</p>
<p>20.2 Vector and Tensor Operators
</p>
<p>Some of you may have learned about groups in your mathematics courses. A group
</p>
<p>consists of a number of elements and some group operation. For example, all the
</p>
<p>real numbers form a group under addition since the addition of any two real numbers
</p>
<p>produces another real number which is a member of the group, there is an identity
</p>
<p>element zero, which when added to any real number produces the same number, and
</p>
<p>an inverse (the negative of a number) which, when added to an element gives the
</p>
<p>identity element [xC .�x/ D 0]. This is not the course to go into elements of group
theory as applied to quantum mechanics, but it is a powerful method. In fact I really
</p>
<p>only want to get to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which offers a very useful method
</p>
<p>for evaluating matrix elements of operators or ratios of matrix elements of operators.
</p>
<p>To do this, I need to introduce the concept of an irreducible tensor operator.
</p>
<p>Rotations also form a group, as do the rotation operators and the rotation matrices
</p>
<p>R
&macr;
.˛; ˇ; &#13;/.2 Any two successive rotations are equivalent to a single rotation. The
</p>
<p>identity element is no rotation at all (or a rotation of 2n� about an axis) and
</p>
<p>the inverse of a rotation is just the reverse rotation. However, you can convince
</p>
<p>yourself that if you perform rotations R1 and then R2 about different axes in three
</p>
<p>dimensions, it does not give the same result as if you reverse the order of the
</p>
<p>rotations. Rotations are said to form a nonabelian group. We have already seen
</p>
<p>that angular momentum is the generator of infinitesimal rotations. The nonabelian
</p>
<p>nature of the rotation group can be linked to the fact that the different components
</p>
<p>of the angular momentum operator do not commute with one another. In fact the
</p>
<p>commutation relations of the angular momentum operators are said to form an
</p>
<p>algebra (algebras have two operations) that determines the properties of the rotation
</p>
<p>group in the vicinity of the identity.
</p>
<p>Why am I introducing these concepts? The reason is that the group structure
</p>
<p>of rotations is determined totally by the angular momentum operators. Thus we
</p>
<p>can define scalar, vector, and tensor operators under rotation in terms of their
</p>
<p>commutation relations with the angular momentum operators, as well as in the way
</p>
<p>they transform under rotation.
</p>
<p>2The rotation matrices R
&macr;
.˛; ˇ; &#13;/ form a group of orthogonal 3 � 3 matrices having determinant
</p>
<p>equal to C1, a group that is refered to as the special orthogonal group in three dimensions, SO(3).
The group of unitary 2 � 2 matrices having determinant equal to C1, such as the D.1=2/ .˛; ˇ; &#13;/
matrices, is refered to as the special unitary group in two dimensions, SU(2).</p>

<p>By considering cyclic permutations of x; y; z, I can generate the remaining com-

Equations (20.31) and their cyclical permutations provide an alternative way to
</p>
<p>define a vector operator.
</p>
<p>I can extend this technique to consider tensor operators of rank two and beyond
</p>
<p>by combining vector operators of rank 1. For example, given two vector operators OA
and OB, a tensor operator of rank 2 is defined as the set of nine operators OCij D OAi OBj
(i; j D 1; 2; 3) that transform under rotation as

</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I try to establish commutation relations of these tensor
</p>
<p>operators with the angular momentum operator, the results are not particularly
</p>
<p>useful.
</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the set of nine operators OCij D OAi OBj do not constitute
what is referred to as an irreducible tensor operator. To understand something about
</p>
<p>irreducible tensor operators, you need to know something about representations of
</p>
<p>groups. A matrix representation of a group is the assignment of a matrix to each
</p>
<p>group element. Clearly the rotation matrix is a three-dimensional representation of
</p>
<p>the rotation group. We say it is isomorphic to the rotation group since each element
</p>
<p>in the group corresponds to a single matrix. However, a representation of the group
</p>
<p>can also be the unit matrix in any number of dimensions&mdash;each group element is
</p>
<p>replaced by the unit matrix. This is referred to as a homomorphism since the same
</p>
<p>matrix corresponds to more than one group element.
</p>
<p>The rotation matrices D
.j/
</p>
<p>mm0
.˛; ˇ; &#13;/ form a .2jC 1/ irreducible representation
</p>
<p>of the rotation group. To understand what is meant by an irreducible representation,
</p>
<p>let me go back to coupling of two angular momenta, which I take for the sake of
</p>
<p>definiteness as J1 D J2 D 1: The eigenkets for these two independent angular
momenta can be written in the direct product basis as</p>

<p>jj1 D 1; j2 D 1Im1;m2i D jj1;m1i jj2;m2i : (20.33)
</p>
<p>Under rotation each of the eigenkets transforms separately and the resultant
</p>
<p>transformation matrix is a very complicated 9 � 9 matrix. However we know that
we can couple these two angular momenta into states having j D 0; 1; 2 specified
by the kets jj1; j2I j;mi. Under rotation the components of each value of j transform
separately such that the total transformation breaks down the 9 � 9 matrix into one
that has a block-diagonal form with 1 � 1 .j D 0/, 3 � 3 .j D 1/, and 5 � 5 .j D 2/
sub-matrices along the diagonals. A matrix representation that is reduced to block
</p>
<p>diagonal form is called an irreducible representation.

<p>What are some examples of irreducible tensor operators? Any scalar operator

<p>that commutes with OJ (such as OJ2) is an irreducible tensor of rank zero. It is not
difficult to show that the components OAx; OAy; OAz of a vector operator do not form an
irreducible tensor of rank 1. However it can be proven rather easily using Eq. (20.31)

<p>that the operators

(using the commutation relations of the components with the angular momentum

<p>where h˛jk T.k/ k˛0j0i is referred to as a reduced matrix element and ˛ and ˛0 are
additional quantum numbers (such as n in the hydrogen atom). The matrix element
</p>
<p>of an irreducible operator is a product of a term that is independent of q, m, and m0,
multiplied by a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. This theorem is extremely useful since
</p>
<p>it lets you calculate matrix elements of different components of a vector or tensor
</p>
<p>operator in terms of one quantity which itself must be calculated explicitly. Some
</p>
<p>authors use a different form for Eq. (20.44) (e.g., they omit the 1=

<p>20.4 Summary
</p>
<p>Several topics were covered in this chapter. Coupling of angular momentum in
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics can be formulated in terms of the Clebsch-Gordan or 3-J
</p>
<p>symbols. In contrast to classical coupling of two vectors, there are only discrete
</p>
<p>ways in which angular momentum can be coupled in quantum mechanics. The
</p>
<p>definition of vector and tensor operators under rotation was introduced and related
</p>
<p>to the commutation relations of the operators with the angular momentum operators.
</p>
<p>It turned out to be useful to introduce a new class of operators, irreducible tensor
</p>
<p>operators, that transformed under rotation in terms of the irreducible representations
</p>
<p>of the rotation group, that is, the D
.k/
</p>
<p>q0q
. A matrix element of an irreducible
</p>
<p>tensor operators could be expressed as a product of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
</p>
<p>multiplied by a reduced matrix element that is independent of the magnetic quantum
</p>
<p>numbers, a result embodied in the Wigner-Eckart theorem.

<p>Hydrogen Atom with Spin in External Fields
</p>
<p>Having established the properties of irreducible tensor operators, I am now in a
</p>
<p>position to use perturbation theory to study how the energy levels of the hydrogen
</p>
<p>atom are modified in external magnetic and electric fields. Before doing so, however,
</p>
<p>I will use perturbation theory to obtain the relativistic corrections to the energy
</p>
<p>levels of hydrogen in the absence of any external fields. This will lead naturally to
</p>
<p>a discussion of the fine-structure and hyperfine structure of hydrogen.
</p>
<p>In the absence of any external fields, the energy levels of hydrogen (including
</p>
<p>electron spin) are given by the solution of the Dirac equation. The Dirac equation
</p>
<p>consistently treats all relativistic effects, but does not include hyperfine structure
</p>
<p>(arising from the magnetic moment of the proton), nor the Lamb shift (to be
</p>
<p>mentioned below). Explicitly, in the absence of any external fields, the energy levels

</p>
<p>Even though the Schr&ouml;dinger equation is a non-relativistic equation, it is possible
</p>
<p>to use perturbation theory to calculate the relativistic corrections to the hydrogenic
</p>
<p>energy levels, corrections that can be attributed to relativistic mass effects, spin&ndash;
</p>
<p>orbit interactions, and the so-called Darwin term. In this manner, the ˛2FS term
</p>
<p>appearing in Eq. (21.3) can be obtained within the context of non-relativistic
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics. I have already discussed spin and the spin&ndash;orbit interaction
</p>
<p>in Chap. 12, so you should review those results.
</p>
<p>In perturbation theory, the Hamiltonian is written as OH D OH0 C OH0, where OH0
includes relativistic corrections, hyperfine interactions, and any atom&ndash;external field
</p>
<p>interactions, while OH0 is the Hamiltonian of hydrogen in the absence of such effects.
The exact eigenkets are expanded in terms of eigenkets of OH0 and approximate
expressions are obtained for the eigenenergies and eigenkets. If there is degeneracy
</p>
<p>and if OH0 couples degenerate states, I must first exactly diagonalize any degenerate
sub-blocks in which there are off-diagonal matrix elements.
</p>
<p>In dealing with any stationary state problem in quantum mechanics, the first
</p>
<p>step is to identify the constants of the motion. Operators corresponding to dynamic
</p>
<p>variables that are constants of the motion commute with the Hamiltonian. I can find
</p>
<p>simultaneous eigenkets of the Hamiltonian and these operators. In problems involv-
</p>
<p>ing perturbation theory, there are two Hamiltonians, the unperturbed Hamiltonian
OH0 and the total Hamiltonian OH D OH0 C OH0. If an operator OA having eigenvalues
labeled by a commutes with both OH0 and OH0, it corresponds to an exact constant
of the motion. As a consequence, the eigenkets of both OH0 and OH can be chosen as
simultaneous eigenkets of OA: If the eigenkets are chosen in this manner, only states
having the same value of the eigenvalue a can be coupled by OH0, since, under these
circumstances, OH0 is diagonal in the jai basis.
</p>
<p>Let me be more specific. Suppose that both OL2 and OLz commute with both OH0 and
OH0; and that OH0 is the Hamiltonian operator for hydrogen without spin. This means
that the exact eigenkets of OH D OH0 C OH0 can be written as jE; `;mi ; whereas the
eigenkets of OH0 are given by jE; `;mi.0/ � jn; `;mi. In carrying out perturbation
theory using the jn; `;mi basis for a given n, only states having the same ` and the
same m can be coupled by OH0; in other words, no degenerate states of OH0 are coupled
by the perturbation and I can use nondegenerate perturbation theory. By identifying
</p>
<p>the constants of the motion, I have dramatically simplified the problem. Note that
</p>
<p>since n does not correspond to the exact energy, states having different n (but the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.1 Energy Levels of Hydrogen 513
</p>
<p>same ` and the same m) can be coupled by OH0; however, contributions from these
terms are usually relatively small since they involve large energy denominators.
</p>
<p>I first consider the hydrogen atom without spin and calculate the relativistic mass
</p>
<p>correction. Spin is then included and the modifications to the energy levels from the
</p>
<p>spin&ndash;orbit interaction are obtained. The role played by the Darwin term is discussed.
</p>
<p>Finally I allow for interactions with constant external magnetic or electric fields. The
</p>
<p>hyperfine interaction is discussed in detail in Appendix 2.

<p>The operators OH; OL2; OLz still form a set of commuting operators allowing me to
specify the states by the quantum numbers E; `;m`. However, there is no longer
</p>
<p>a single quantum number n that uniquely determines the energy. The energy of a
</p>
<p>given level now depends on both n and `, since the relativistic term has broken
</p>
<p>the dynamic symmetry (the classical orbit precesses&mdash;it is no longer closed and the
</p>
<p>Lenz vector is not a constant of the motion). To get the energies exactly I would

<p>need to solve the Dirac equation. To get approximate energies and eigenfunctions I
</p>
<p>can use the Schr&ouml;dinger equation and perturbation theory.

<p>where I used the fact that H0rel is diagonal in both ` and m`, since both OL2 and OLz
are constants of the motion. The second order energy corrections are ˛2FS times
</p>
<p>smaller than the first order corrections.1 I neglect any such corrections throughout
</p>
<p>this chapter.
</p>
<p>21.1.3 Spin Included
</p>
<p>If spin is included, but spin-dependent interactions are neglected, the degeneracy of
</p>
<p>each state is doubled since the electron can have spin quantum numbers ms D ˙1=2.
The total (orbital plus spin) angular momentum operator is
</p>
<p>OJ D OLC OS: (21.19)
</p>
<p>Since OJ2 and OJz and are constants of the motion, states can be labeled by either
jn; `;m`; s;msi or
</p>
<p>ˇ̌
n; `; s; j;mj
</p>
<p>˛
. You cannot use both sets of labels since OJ2 does not
</p>
<p>commute with OLz and OSz separately, only with their sum, OJz D OLz C OSz.
The results obtained in Sect. 21.1.2 are unchanged since the relativistic mass
</p>
<p>correction to the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (21.9) is spin-independent. States having
</p>
<p>a given ` and different j are still degenerate. Thus, the n D 2,` D 1 state is six-fold
degenerate and can be labeled either by n D 2; ` D 1;m` D ˙1; 0Ims D ˙1=2 or
by n D 2; ` D 1; j D 1=2; 3=2 with mj D �3=2;�1=2; 1=2; 3=2 for j D 3=2 and
mj D �1=2; 1=2 for j D 1=2:
</p>
<p>21.1.4 Spin&ndash;Orbit Interaction
</p>
<p>The spin&ndash;orbit interaction leads to an additional term in the Hamiltonian given by

<p>(From this point onwards, I drop the carets on the angular momentum and

by about 1.06 GHz and the n D 1, ` D 0; j D 1=2 level is shifted up by about
8.17 GHz. The Lamb shift breaks the degeneracy of states having the same n but

<p>21.1 Energy Levels of Hydrogen 523
</p>
<p>21.1.9 Addition of a Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>I now want to consider the influence of external magnetic and electric fields on
</p>
<p>the energy levels of hydrogen. Although external magnetic fields couple different
</p>
<p>hyperfine levels much more strongly than different fine structure levels (see
</p>
<p>Appendix 2), I neglect hyperfine structure in discussing magnetic and electric field
</p>
<p>effects. This is not because they are unimportant, but simply because I want to
</p>
<p>illustrate some physical concepts that are more easily understood if the hyperfine
</p>
<p>interaction is neglected.
</p>
<p>The modifications of the energy levels of atoms by an external magnetic field are
</p>
<p>often referred to as the Zeeman effect (after Pieter Zeeman). If a magnetic field is
</p>
<p>present along the z direction, a term
</p>
<p>OH0B D
ˇ0B
</p>
<p>&bdquo; .Lz C 2Sz/ D
ˇ0B
</p>
<p>&bdquo; .Jz C Sz/ (21.40)
</p>
<p>must be added to the Hamiltonian. Recall that ˇ0 D e&bdquo;=2me is the Bohr magneton
and that ˇ0/h � 14 GHz/T. The total Hamiltonian then consists of the unperturbed
Hamiltonian of hydrogen plus contributions from both the relativistic corrections
</p>
<p>(relativistic mass, spin-orbit, and Darwin terms) and the Zeeman effect. The only
</p>
<p>constants of the motion for the total Hamiltonian are E;L2; S2; Jz. The magnitude
</p>
<p>of the total angular momentum is not a constant of the motion since OJ2 does not
commute with OSz, and the z-components of the orbital and spin angular momenta
are not constants of the motion since OLz and OSz do not commute with OL � OS, which
appears as a factor in the spin-orbit term of the Hamiltonian. Thus the eigenkets
</p>
<p>can be labeled by
ˇ̌
E; `; s D 1=2;mj
</p>
<p>˛
. I will drop the s label since s D 1=2. In a
</p>
<p>given n manifold, the energy E of a state having a given `;mj now depends on some
</p>
<p>complicated combination of the spin&ndash;orbit and Zeeman interactions.
</p>
<p>To apply degenerate perturbation theory, I can use either the
ˇ̌
n; `; j;mj
</p>
<p>˛
or the
</p>
<p>jn; `;m`;msi basis kets, remembering that only states having the same ` and the
same mj D m` C ms can be coupled since L2 and Jz are constants of the motion. In
other words, ` and mj D m` C ms remain good quantum numbers in the presence
of an external magnetic field. It is relatively easy to calculate the matrix elements
</p>
<p>in either basis in a state of given n. Once the matrix elements are calculated, you
</p>
<p>need to diagonalize each degenerate sub-block. If the spin-orbit coupling is much
</p>
<p>larger than the magnetic field interaction strength, then j is an approximate good
</p>
<p>quantum number since J2 is an approximate constant of the motion. In this limit theˇ̌
n; `; j;mj
</p>
<p>˛
are approximate eigenkets that can be used to carry out nondegenerate
</p>
<p>perturbation theory for the magnetic-field interaction. On the other hand, if the
</p>
<p>magnetic field interaction strength is much larger than the spin-orbit coupling
</p>
<p>strength, then m` and ms are approximate good quantum number since Lz and
</p>
<p>Sz are an approximate constants of the motion. In this case, the jn; `;m`;msi are
approximate eigenkets that can be used to carry out nondegenerate perturbation
</p>
<p>theory for the spin&ndash;orbit and other relativistic interactions.</p>

<p>To obtain the exact (exact only in the sense that I neglect coupling between different
</p>
<p>electronic state manifolds) eigenkets and eigenenergies, I must diagonalize these
</p>
<p>matrices for a given value of n and `. Before doing so, let me look at the weak and
</p>
<p>strong field limits.
</p>
<p>Consider the n D 2; ` D 1 manifold which consists of six degenerate levels
in the absence of any magnetic fields and any relativistic corrections. The fine
</p>
<p>structure splitting is about 11 GHz and, since ˇ0=h D 14:0 GHz/T, the magnetic
and fine structure interactions are comparable for field strengths of 1 T or above.
</p>
<p>In weak fields of much less than 1 T, the
ˇ̌
n; `; j;mj
</p>
<p>˛
are approximate eigenkets.
</p>
<p>That is, to lowest order I can neglect the magnetic field interaction entirely. The
</p>
<p>corrections arising from the magnetic field interaction can then be calculated using
</p>
<p>nondegenerate perturbation theory in the
ˇ̌
n; `; j;mj
</p>
<p>˛
basis. In this limit, the change
</p>
<p>in the energy levels produced by the magnetic field is given approximately by the

<p>must be added to the Hamiltonian.2 The splitting of atomic energy levels by an

<p>electric field is commonly referred to as the Stark effect (Johannes Stark discovered
</p>
<p>this effect in 1913). I have already discussed the linear Stark effect in hydrogen in the

<p>context of degenerate perturbation theory, but relativistic corrections and spin were
</p>
<p>neglected in that discussion. In the presence of a constant external electric field, L2;
</p>
<p>L, and J2 are no longer constants of the motion for the total Hamiltonian. The only
</p>
<p>constants of the motion are E; S2; and Jz. For example, in the n D 2 manifold there
are eight states that can be characterized by their energy and mj values. The states
</p>
<p>having mj D 3=2 Œm` D 1;ms D 1=2&#141; and mj D �3=2 Œm` D �1;ms D �1=2&#141; are
not coupled to any other states by the field and remain a degenerate doublet. The
</p>
<p>other states break up into two triplets of states coupled by both the spin&ndash;orbit and
</p>
<p>electric field interactions. It turns out that the energies of the levels do not depend
</p>
<p>on the sign of mj.

are states j2i,j6i,j7i having mj D �1=2. However, the eigenvalues do not depend on
the sign of mj. Thus, these six states break up into three degenerate pairs of levels,

<p>The Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom in an external electric field remains invariant
</p>
<p>under time reversal. Since the time-reversal operator effectively reverses the sign of

<p>mj in the eigenkets, the energy must be independent of the sign of mj.
3 In the case of

<p>hydrogen in an external magnetic field, time reversal symmetry is broken since the
</p>
<p>magnetic moment operator changes sign under time reversal; as a consequence, the
</p>
<p>magnetic field can totally lift the degeneracy of the different magnetic sublevels.

<p>21.2 Multi-Electron Atoms in a Magnetic Field:
</p>
<p>Vector Model
</p>
<p>In multi-electron atoms the coupling of the orbital and spin angular momentum
</p>
<p>of all the electrons constitutes a very difficult problem. For atoms having atomic
</p>
<p>number Z . 30, however, it is often a good approximation to couple the spin angular
</p>
<p>momentum of the valence band electrons into a total spin angular momentum S and
</p>
<p>the orbital angular momentum of the valence band electrons into a total orbital
</p>
<p>angular momentum L. The total angular momentum of all the electrons is then
</p>
<p>J D LC S (Russel-Saunders or L-S coupling scheme).4 If a multi-electron atom
whose structure can be approximated by an L-S coupling scheme is placed in a
</p>
<p>magnetic field, it is relatively easy to calculate the level splitting approximately in
</p>
<p>the limits that the spin-orbit coupling is much less than or much greater than the
</p>
<p>Zeeman splitting. Moreover, there is a classical vector model that can be used in
</p>
<p>each of these cases. In all cases, I take the magnetic field along the z-axis. In an
</p>
<p>external magnetic field, L, S; and mJ D mL C ms remain good quantum numbers.
</p>
<p>21.2.1 Zeeman Splitting Much Greater Than Spin-Orbit
</p>
<p>Splitting
</p>
<p>As in the case of hydrogen, I can simply ignore the spin-orbit coupling to lowest
</p>
<p>order. In this limit the magnetic field splitting in a state of given S and L is
</p>
<p>4In the opposite limit of high Z atoms, a j�j coupling scheme can be used in which the total angular
momentum of the atom is the sum of the total angular momenta of the individual electrons.</p>

</p>
<p>In a vector model [see Fig. 21.5 (a)], the magnetic field is sufficiently strong to cause
</p>
<p>the total spin and total orbital angular momentum to precess separately around the
</p>
<p>field vector. All components of the spin and orbital magnetic moments average to
</p>
<p>zero owing to the precession, except their components along the z-axis. These

<p>I have presented a rather detailed account of the relativistic corrections to the energy

<p>levels of hydrogen. In addition, the modifications of the energy levels produced by

<p>external magnetic and electric fields were calculated. Special emphasis was placed
</p>
<p>on the role played by approximate constants of the motion. The vector model of
</p>
<p>coupling of angular momentum was introduced and used to calculate the Zeeman
</p>
<p>splitting of atomic energy levels characterized by some total angular momentum
</p>
<p>quantum number. A calculation of the hyperfine splitting in hydrogen is given in
</p>
<p>Appendix 2, where the Zeeman splitting, including the hyperfine interaction, is also
</p>
<p>discussed.

</p>
<p>For the proton gp � 5:586 and for the neutron gn � �3:826. Note that the neutron
has a magnetic moment even though it is neutral. The reason for this is that the
</p>
<p>neutron, like the proton, is a composite particle, composed of three quarks bound
</p>
<p>by gluons. Whereas the magnetic moment of the electron arises naturally from
</p>
<p>the Dirac equation, there is no analogous equation that gives the nuclear magnetic
</p>
<p>moments. Theories based on quantum chromodynamics attempt to predict the values
</p>
<p>of nuclear magnetic moments by considering the baryons to be composed of quarks
</p>
<p>and gluons.
</p>
<p>For hydrogen, the nucleus consists of a single proton, whose magnetic moment
</p>
<p>interacts with the magnetic field produced by the electron. There are two contri-
</p>
<p>butions to the magnetic field produced by the electron, one from its orbital motion
</p>
<p>and one from its intrinsic spin. There is no Thomas precession in calculating the
</p>
<p>hyperfine interaction as there was for the fine structure calculation since the proton
</p>
<p>is in an inertial frame whereas the electron was in an accelerating frame. Classically,
</p>
<p>the electron can be modeled as a point magnetic dipole having mass me, magnetic
</p>
<p>moment ms, and charge�e. If this point dipole is located at position r and has orbital
angular momentum L about the origin, it produces a field at the origin given by

</p>
<p>equations and is related to the fact that the field at the center of a &ldquo;point&rdquo; dipole
</p>
<p>diverges. The third term is the field arising from the orbital motion of the electron.

<p>It turns out that the spin&ndash;spin interaction [second term in Eq. (21.100)] averages

the orbital motion of the electron also vanishes for ` D 0 states. As a consequence,

even though they are derived assuming ` &curren; 0.
</p>
<p>For a spin 1/2 atom such as hydrogen, the only contribution to the hyperfine
</p>
<p>interaction is associated with the magnetic dipole moment of the proton. Nuclei
</p>
<p>having spin I � 1 possess an electric quadrupole moment as well, which also
gives rise to a hyperfine interaction. In this case, the additional hyperfine interaction
</p>
<p>results from the interaction of the nuclear quadrupole with the electric field gradient
</p>
<p>at the nucleus produced by the atomic electrons.
</p>
<p>21.5.2 Zeeman Splitting
</p>
<p>In the presence of an external magnetic field, there is an additional interaction
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian that is still given approximately by Eq. (21.40) (the interaction of
</p>
<p>the nuclear magnetic moment with the field can be neglected since it is about
</p>
<p>me=mp times smaller than the electronic contribution). Within a given fine structure
</p>
<p>manifold j there are two hyperfine levels having f D j ˙ 1=2. The calculation
of the effect of a magnetic field on these levels is similar to that of a magnetic
</p>
<p>field on the two fine structure levels j D ` ˙ 1=2 within a given ` manifold
that was considered in Sect. 21.1.9. In other words, in weak magnetic fields, mf is
</p>
<p>approximately a good quantum number and each hyperfine level splits into .2f C 1/
components. With increasing field strength there is a transition to the Paschen-Back
</p>
<p>region in which mj and mI are approximately good quantum numbers. This region
</p>
<p>actually corresponds to the weak field regime of the Zeeman splitting of a state
</p>
<p>characterized by quantum number j&mdash;that is, the components coalesce into a set of
</p>
<p>.2jC 1/ distinct energy levels, each of which is doubly-degenerate, owing to the
nuclear spin. The .2jC 1/ energy levels are those of the weak field Zeeman effect
for this j D 1=2 state. I concentrate mainly on the weak field regime, since the
strong-field regime reproduces the weak field results that were obtained neglecting
</p>
<p>hyperfine structure.
</p>
<p>I first consider S states, for which the hyperfine and Zeeman interaction

<p>There is an important difference from the Zeeman effect that we encountered for
</p>
<p>fine structure levels. Since the hyperfine splitting is 10 to a 1000 times smaller than
</p>
<p>the fine structure splitting, the crossover to the Paschen-Back region occurs at much
</p>
<p>lower field strengths for hyperfine levels. In fact, the ability to tune the energy of
</p>
<p>the hyperfine levels using magnetic field strengths that are easily accessible in the
</p>
<p>laboratory plays an important role in modern atomic spectroscopy.
</p>
<p>In weak fields for other than S states, the Zeeman shift of the energy levels

<p>Time-Dependent Problems
</p>
<p>The topics I will cover in the last three chapters of this book relate to time-dependent
</p>
<p>problems. Generally speaking, these will involve problems in which some classical,
</p>
<p>time-dependent interaction, such as that produced by an applied electric or magnetic
</p>
<p>field, induces transitions between states of a quantum system. I will first consider
</p>
<p>some very general features of time-dependent problems and then look in detail at
</p>
<p>a spin 1/2 system in a magnetic field and a two-level atom in an optical field. The
</p>
<p>density matrix of a single quantum system will be defined and the Bloch and optical
</p>
<p>Bloch equations will be derived. After studying these &ldquo;exact&rdquo; problems, I will
</p>
<p>look at approximation techniques involving time-dependent problems in Chap. 23,
</p>
<p>including both the sudden and adiabatic limits. Finally, I will discuss the transitions
</p>
<p>between a discrete state and a continuum of states in Chap. 24, including Fermi&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>golden rule.
</p>
<p>22.1 Time-Dependent Problems
</p>
<p>There are classes of problems in quantum mechanics in which an isolated quantum
</p>
<p>system interacts with some externally applied fields. The isolated quantum system
</p>
<p>is characterized by a Hamiltonian OH0 and its interaction with the external fields by a
time-dependent contribution OV.t/ to the total Hamiltonian OH. In Dirac notation the
total Hamiltonian is written in matrix form as
</p>
<p>H
&macr;
.t/ D H
</p>
<p>&macr;
0 C V
</p>
<p>&macr;
.t/: (22.1)
</p>
<p>For example, H
&macr;
0 can be the Hamiltonian associated with an isolated atom and V
</p>
<p>&macr;
.t/
</p>
<p>can represent the interaction energy of the atom with a classical optical field. If H
&macr;
.t/
</p>
<p>depends on time, the energy is no longer a constant of the motion. Let the eigenkets
</p>
<p>of H
&macr;
0 be denoted by jni, such that

</p>
<p>22.1.1 Interaction Representation
</p>
<p>In some sense, I am done. Either I can solve Eq. (22.8) or I cannot. That does not
</p>
<p>prevent me from modifying the equation into what may be a more convenient form.
</p>
<p>Remember, however, that modifying the equation does not make it solvable, but it
</p>
<p>may reveal a structure where the solution is more apparent. The first such mod-
</p>
<p>ification that I use, applicable to any time-dependent quantum problem, involves
</p>
<p>an interaction representation. The idea behind the interaction representation is to
</p>
<p>have the state amplitudes be constant in the absence of the interaction V
&macr;
.t/. To
</p>
<p>accomplish this, I must remove the rapidly varying phase factor exp.�iEnt=&bdquo;/ from

not to forget this time dependence when calculating expectation values of operators.
</p>
<p>In general, the interaction representation is used often in numerical solutions
</p>
<p>rather than the Schr&ouml;dinger representation; in this manner, you need not start the
</p>
<p>integration until the interaction is turned on. In the Schr&ouml;dinger representation, the
</p>
<p>phases of the state amplitudes evolve even in the absence of the interaction.
</p>
<p>22.2 Spin 1/2 Quantum System in a Magnetic Field

<p>As a first example, I consider the interaction of the spin 1/2 quantum system with

<p>an external magnetic field induction

<p>B.t/ D B0uz C jBx.t/j cos Œ!t � �.t/&#141; ux; (22.19)
</p>
<p>In other words, the z-component of the field is constant and the x-component is
</p>
<p>an oscillatory field having carrier frequency !, amplitude jBx.t/j ; and phase �.t/.
The interaction of a spin 1/2 quantum system with a magnetic field of the type
</p>
<p>given in Eq. (22.19) is not only of theoretical interest. For example, when a strong
</p>
<p>constant magnetic field is applied in the z-direction, and pulsed oscillating fields
</p>
<p>are applied in the x-direction that are in resonance with the transition between the
</p>
<p>spin states, it is possible to control the population difference between the spin up
</p>
<p>and spin down states, as well as the relative phase between the state amplitudes.

<p>22.3 Two-Level Atom
</p>
<p>The problem of a spin 1/2 particle in a magnetic field is isomorphic to the problem
</p>
<p>of a two-level atom interacting with an optical field. It is not difficult to imagine a
</p>
<p>situation where such a two-level approximation is valid. For example, if an optical
</p>
<p>field is nearly resonant with the ground to first excited state transition frequency
</p>
<p>of an atom whose ground and excited states have angular momentum quantum
</p>
<p>numbers J D 0 and J D 1; respectively, and if the field is z-polarized, then the
field interacts effectively with only the ground state and the m D 0 sublevel of the
excited state. To make matters simple, you can think of the atom as a one electron
</p>
<p>atom whose nucleus is located at position R. The position of the electron relative to
</p>
<p>the nucleus is denoted by r.
</p>
<p>In dipole approximation, the interaction Hamiltonian is given by
</p>
<p>OV.R; t/ D OVAF.R; t/ � �Ope�E.R; t/ D eOr � E.R; t/ ; (22.46)</p>

<p>where Ope D �eOr is the atomic dipole moment operator (a matrix in the Dirac picture)
and E.R; t/ is the applied electric field, evaluated at the nuclear position. Recall that
</p>
<p>the charge of the electron is �e in my notation. If atomic motion is neglected as I
assume, I can set R D 0.

<p>is the complex field amplitude, ! is the carrier frequency of the field, jE0.t/j is
the field amplitude, and '.t/ is the field phase. Both the amplitude and phase
</p>
<p>can be functions of time. A time-varying amplitude could correspond to a pulse
</p>
<p>envelope, while a time-varying phase gives rise to a frequency &ldquo;chirp&rdquo; (a frequency
</p>
<p>that varies in time). With this choice of field, the interaction Hamiltonian becomes

excited state eigenket by j2i, I write the probability amplitudes as

<p>The diagonal elements of the interaction Hamiltonian vanish since the operator Oz
has odd parity. In general the matrix element z12 is complex, but any single transition

<p>matrix element can be taken as real by an appropriate choice of phase in the wave
</p>
<p>function (however, if z12 is taken to be real, then one is not at liberty to take x12
real since the phase of the electronic part of the wave function has been fixed&mdash;the

for the Pauli matrices requires that I take aB D
</p>
<p>�

<p>the two cases is given by the substitutions:</p>

</p>
<p>Although the equations for the two-level atom interacting with an electric field
</p>
<p>and the spin system interacting with a magnetic field look the same, the physical
</p>
<p>values of the parameters for the two systems differ markedly. That is, the frequency
</p>
<p>separation of the spin up and spin down states in a constant external magnetic
</p>
<p>field can range between 0 Hz and 10 GHz, while radio-frequency (rf) coupling
</p>
<p>strengths !x.t/ are typically less than 1.0 MHz. In the optical case, electronic
</p>
<p>transition frequencies !0 are of order 10
14&ndash;1016 Hz and coupling strengths vary, but
</p>
<p>are typically much less than the frequency separation of the levels. Only for intense
</p>
<p>laser pulses having intensities greater than 1017 W/cm2 can the coupling strength
</p>
<p>be comparable to the optical frequency separations. For a typical cw (continuous-
</p>
<p>wave) lasers having a few mW of power, coupling strengths are typically in the MHz
</p>
<p>to GHz range. Given this qualitative difference in the magnetic and electric cases,
</p>
<p>it is not surprising that different approximation schemes are used in the two cases.
</p>
<p>You will see that a rotating wave approximation is usually a good approximation for
</p>
<p>atom&ndash;optical field interactions, based on the assumption that !0 � j&#127;0.t/j, but this
is not necessarily so for the magnetic case.
</p>
<p>I will restrict the discussion to the optical case, but you should appreciate the fact
</p>
<p>that the discussion applies equally well to the magnetic field case if j!x.t/j � !0
and j! � !0j = j! C !0j � 1, conditions under which many NMR experiments are
carried out.
</p>
<p>22.3.1 Rotating-Wave or Resonance Approximation
</p>
<p>Although Eq. (22.58) can be solved numerically, it is best to gain some physical
</p>
<p>insight into this equation before launching into any solutions. You shouldn&rsquo;t be
</p>
<p>deceived by the apparent simplicity of these coupled equations. There are books
</p>
<p>devoted to these equations and even numerical solutions can be difficult to obtain in
</p>
<p>certain limits.
</p>
<p>Without solving the problem, you can ask under what conditions the field is
</p>
<p>effective in driving transitions between levels 1 and 2. I assume that the amplitude
</p>
<p>j&#127;0.t/j and phase �.t/ of the field are slowly varying on a time scale of order !�1.
In this limit, the field can be considered to be quasi-monochromatic. Moreover, I
</p>
<p>assume that j.!0 � !/ =.!0 C !/j � 1 and j&#127;0.t/=.!0 C !/j � 1. Under these
assumptions, the field is effective in driving the 1-2 transition provided j!0 � !j is
small compared with j&#127;0.t/j.</p>

oscillation at frequency j&#127;0.t/j. As long as j&#127;0.t/=.!0C!/j � 1, jı=.!0 C !/j �

<p>In the case of an applied field pulse which &ldquo;turns on&rdquo; at t D �1, the initial

<p>transferred from the initial to final state. For reasons to be discussed in connection
</p>
<p>with the Bloch vector, A is defined such that a pulse area of � corresponds to a
</p>

</p>
<p>I have arrived at a pretty interesting result. You can control the degree of
</p>
<p>excitation that is achieved by a proper choice of pulse area, I might note, however,
</p>
<p>that the use of a � pulse for level inversion is not a &ldquo;robust&rdquo; method (when I
</p>
<p>was young, &ldquo;robust&rdquo; was used only to describe coffee). One must insure that the
</p>
<p>pulse intensity is uniform over the entire sample and that the pulse area is exactly
</p>
<p>equal to � to insure that all the atoms are inverted. There are other methods for
</p>
<p>achieving level inversion that are more robust. One such method is discussed in the

<p>next chapter.

Even though the field is off resonance, the time-averaged transition probability falls

<p>off inversely only as 1=ı2. In fact, I can turn off the field at a time t D T D �=&#127; and
find that jc2.T/j2 � j&#127;0j2 =ı2. From the energy-time &ldquo;uncertainty principle,&rdquo; you
might expect that the transition probability would vanish at least exponentially with

<p>jıjT (recall that increasing the light intensity in the photoelectric experiment does
not increase the number of photoelectrons if the field frequency is not sufficiently

</p>
<p>Had the field been turned on and off smoothly, one would indeed find that

<p>jc2.t/j2 � e�f .jıjT/, where f is some positive function. However, in the calculation
that was carried out, the field is turned on instantaneously at t D 0 and turned
off instantaneously at t D T . Owing to the point jump discontinuities, the Fourier
components of a step function vary inversely with ıT , rather than as an exponentially

<p>decaying function of jıjT .

<p>manipulations of the equations. For the two-level problem and arbitrary&#127;0.t/, there
</p>
<p>is not much difference between the interaction and field interaction representations.
</p>
<p>Differences between the two representations arise in problems involving more than
</p>
<p>two levels and more than a single field. Generally speaking, the field interaction
</p>
<p>representation is most useful when a single field drives transitions between two
</p>
<p>manifolds of levels, while the interaction representation should be used when
</p>
<p>fields having two or more frequencies drive transitions between two levels or two
</p>
<p>manifolds of levels.

<p>22.4 Density Matrix for a Single Atom
</p>
<p>In the previous section, I showed in detail how to obtain solutions of the time-

<p>dependent Schr&ouml;dinger equation for the state amplitudes of a two-level spin system
</p>
<p>interacting with a magnetic field and a two-level atom interacting with an optical
</p>
<p>field. To make connection with experiment, however, you need to know how the
</p>
<p>state amplitudes are related to the possible outcomes of measurements. Any physical
</p>
<p>measurement yields real results, while the state amplitudes are complex. From the
</p>
<p>considerations of Chap. 5, you know that the expectation value of any Hermitian
</p>
<p>operator corresponding to a physical observable depends on bilinear products of
</p>
<p>the state amplitudes. For example, if you were to calculate the expectation value of
</p>
<p>the electric dipole moment of a two-level atom, you would find that it depends on
</p>

<p>Fig. 22.2 Spontaneous emission in a two-level atom
</p>
<p>where the fact that Or is an odd parity operator has been used.
A knowledge of the state amplitudes allows you to calculate the expectation
</p>
<p>values of any operators. Although all the information is contained in the state
</p>
<p>amplitudes, we are not necessarily interested in all the information. If we measure
</p>
<p>only part of the information content of a system, an amplitude approach is often no
</p>
<p>longer satisfactory. This concept can be illustrated with a simple example.
</p>
<p>Let us look at spontaneous decay in a two-level atom, Fig. 22.2. As a result
</p>
<p>of spontaneous decay (to be discussed in Chap. 24), the upper state population
</p>
<p>n2.t/ D ja2.t/j2 decreases and the lower state population n1.t/ D ja1.t/j2 increases
according to
</p>
<p>Pn2.t/ D �&#13;2n2.t/I (22.98a)
Pn1.t/ D &#13;2n2.t/ ; (22.98b)
</p>
<p>where the excited state decay rate &#13;2 is real. Is it possible to account for this decay
</p>
<p>in an amplitude picture? You can try the equation
</p>
<p>Pa2.t/ D �
&#13;2

</p>
<p>a2.t/ ; (22.99)

</p>
<p>It works! But try to reproduce Eq. (22.98b) in a simple amplitude picture&mdash;you will
</p>
<p>find it impossible to do so.
</p>
<p>In problems of this nature, where atoms interact with a thermal bath, such as
</p>
<p>the vacuum field for spontaneous emission, the total Hamiltonian consists of a term
</p>
<p>for the atoms, a term for the fields and a term for the atom&ndash;field interaction. The
</p>
<p>vacuum field is quantized, so all terms in the Hamiltonian are time-independent.

<p>and the fields. If we are interested in the atomic state variables only, it is necessary to

<p>The off-diagonal density matrix elements are complex, in general, and cannot

<p>the optical case, I use the field interaction representation. Both approaches lead to

</p>
<p>One often refers to u and v (as well as Q�12 and Q�21) as &ldquo;coherence.&rdquo; There is a simple
geometric interpretation of Eq. (22.137) as well. The Bloch vector B precesses about

<p>You can use what you have learned about irreducible tensor operators and the
</p>
<p>Wigner-Eckart theorem to derive selection rules for electric dipole and magnetic
</p>
<p>dipole transitions. The selection rules tell you what states can be coupled by these
</p>
<p>interactions. For the sake of definiteness, I assume the eigenkets of an atom in the
</p>
<p>absence of the atom&ndash;field interactions can be written as jnLSIJFmFi ;where n labels
the electronic state manifold. In other words, I assume a Russell-Saunders coupling
</p>
<p>scheme in which the total orbital and spin angular momenta remain good quantum
</p>
<p>numbers.</p>

<p>22.4.3.1 Electric Dipole Transitions
</p>
<p>The electric dipole interaction is given by Eq. (22.46), namely
</p>
<p>OH0e D �Ope � E.R; t/; (22.144)
</p>
<p>where Ope is the electric dipole moment operator of the atom. To derive selection
rules, I must determine which of the matrix elements
</p>
<p>˝
n0L0S0IJ0F0m0F
</p>
<p>ˇ̌
Ope jnLSIJFmFi (22.145)
</p>
<p>are non-vanishing. Since Ope is a vector operator that can be written in terms of the
components of an irreducible tensor of rank 1, it follows from the Wigner-Eckart
</p>
<p>theorem and the properties of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients that this matrix
</p>
<p>element vanishes unless &#129;F D F0 � F D ˙1; 0, and that any F D F0 D 0
matrix element also vanishes. Furthermore if I use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
</p>
<p>to expand jnLSIJFmFi in terms of jnLSJmJi jI mIi eigenkets, it also follows that a
second selection rule is &#129;J D ˙1; 0 and J D 0! 0 transitions are forbidden. The
reason for this is that the operator Ope depends only on spatial coordinates and must
be diagonal in the nuclear spin quantum numbers. Continuing the development by
</p>
<p>expanding jnLSJmJi in terms of jnLmLi jSmSi eigenkets, I arrive at the selection
rules &#129;S D 0, &#129;L D ˙1; 0. However, since Ope is an odd parity operator, L must
change by an odd integer&mdash;&#129;L D 0 is ruled out. To summarize, for the electric
dipole matrix elements to be non-vanishing, the selection rules &#129;F D ˙1; 0,
&#129;J D ˙1; 0, &#129;S D 0, and &#129;L D ˙1 must be satisfied, with F D 0 ! 0 and
J D 0! 0 transitions also forbidden.
</p>
<p>It also follows from the Wigner-Eckart theorem and the properties of the Clebsch-
</p>
<p>Gordan coefficients that the selection rules for the azimuthal quantum numbers are
</p>
<p>&#129;mF D ˙1; 0. The relative contribution of the &#129;mF D ˙1; 0 matrix elements
depends on the polarization of the electric field. I take the electric field to be of the

F D 0 ! 0 and J D 0 ! 0 transitions also forbidden. The selection rule on
spin angular momentum is still &#129;S D 0 since the interaction cannot change the
magnitude of the spin; however, the selection rule for &#129;L is now &#129;L D 0; since
the interaction (22.159) couples only those states having the same parity. Moreover,

<p>since the interaction does not depend on spatial operators such as Ope, there is now
a selection rule on n, &#129;n D 0. Magnetic fields couple only those states within a

<p>22.5 Summary
</p>
<p>In this chapter, I presented an introduction to problems that can be categorized as
</p>
<p>semi-classical, in which a classical time-dependent field interacts with a quantum
</p>
<p>system. Some general results were derived and specific examples were given related
</p>
<p>to the interaction of a magnetic field with a spin 1/2 quantum system and an optical
</p>
<p>field with a two-level atom. The concept of the density matrix was introduced and
</p>
<p>the Bloch equations were derived.

with time-dependent external fields), OH2 is the time-independent Hamiltonian of
the bath, and OV is the atom&ndash;bath interaction energy. The eigenkets of the time-
independent part of OH1 are denoted by jn1i and the eigenkets of OH2 are denoted by</p>

<p>where I have assumed that the initial state is not affected very much by the
</p>
<p>perturbation, allowing me to replace c0.t

</p>
<p>approach is valid only if
</p>

</p>
<p>It turns out that this condition is necessary, but not sufficient, for perturbation theory
</p>
<p>to be valid. Since state amplitudes have phases, it is possible for these phases to
</p>
<p>become greater than unity even when condition (23.5) holds. In that case there is
</p>
<p>also a breakdown of perturbation theory.
</p>
<p>As an example of the use of time-dependent perturbation theory, consider a pulse
</p>
<p>of laser radiation having electric field amplitude at the position of an atom that
</p>
<p>varies as
</p>
<p>E.t/ D �E0.t/ cos .!t/ ; (23.6)

<p>where � is the field polarization and E0.t/ is the field amplitude envelope function.

<p>is detuned by ! � !n0, the pulse duration must be less than or comparable to

frequency components at the transition frequency.

<p>23.2 Adiabatic Approximation 597
</p>

</p>
<p>This is an amazing result&mdash;the exact solution agrees with the solution to first
</p>
<p>order in perturbation theory. The reason for this is clear. The response of a simple
</p>
<p>harmonic oscillator to an applied electric field is always linear in the field. Since
</p>
<p>higher order perturbation theory would produce terms that are nonlinear in the field
</p>
<p>amplitude, any such contributions to hx.t/i must vanish! This does not mean that
successive terms in higher order perturbation theory vanish. On the contrary, such
</p>
<p>terms drive the quantum oscillator up and down the ladder of n states; however, they
</p>
<p>do so in such a fashion that these higher order terms do not contribute to hx.t/i.
</p>
<p>23.2 Adiabatic Approximation
</p>
<p>The adiabatic approximation seems mysterious and even magical, but it is really
</p>
<p>based on a simple premise. Consider the equation of motion
</p>
<p>Pa.t/ D �iW.t/a.t/ (23.24)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>W.t/ D H.t/=&bdquo;; (23.25)
</p>
<p>and I have changed the notation somewhat by representing matrices by boldface
</p>
<p>variables, rather than with underscores. You can think of W.t/ as an effective
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian in frequency units. Imagine that W is constant. Then I could simply
</p>
<p>obtain the eigenvalues and eigenkets of W and expand the state vector in terms
</p>
<p>of these eigenkets. The state populations remain constant and their amplitudes
</p>
<p>acquire a phase factor, e�i!nt, where the !n are eigenvalues of W. If W is not
constant, it no longer possesses time-independent eigenkets; however, if W.t/ does
</p>
<p>not contain Fourier components equal or nearly equal to the frequency separation
</p>
<p>of the instantaneous eigenvalues of W.t/ (that is, the eigenvalues at time t), then
</p>
<p>transitions between the instantaneous eigenkets of W.t/ can be neglected. In that
</p>
<p>limit it is relatively easy to solve for the state amplitudes.
</p>
<p>To see this more formally, I set
</p>
<p>x.t/ D T.t/a.t/ ; (23.26)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>598 23 Approximation Techniques in Time-Dependent Problems

<p>where the unitary matrix T.t/ is chosen such that
</p>
<p>ƒ.t/ D T.t/W.t/T&#142;.t/ (23.27)
</p>
<p>is diagonal. Then

D �iƒ.t/x.t/C PT.t/T&#142;.t/x.t/ : (23.28)
</p>
<p>The adiabatic approach is useful only if the PT.t/T&#142;.t/ term can be neglected, which
is generally the case if the frequency difference between the diagonal elements of
</p>
<p>ƒ.t/ is much larger than the inverse of the time interval in which T.t/ changes

</p>
<p>23.3 Sudden Approximation
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;opposite&rdquo; of the adiabatic approximation is the sudden approximation. In the
</p>
<p>sudden approximation, the Hamiltonian is changed suddenly from one Hamiltonian,
</p>
<p>say OH1, to another, say OH2, at time t D t0. If this is the case the result is simple.
You can expand the wave function at t D t0 in terms of the new eigenkets. The
state vector then evolves under the new Hamiltonian with this initial condition. The
</p>
<p>sudden approximation is valid if the Hamiltonian is changed in a time that is much
</p>
<p>shorter than all the inverse transition frequencies of the original Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>For example, consider the interaction of the spin magnetic moment of the
</p>
<p>electron with a magnetic field

<p>Suppose that at t D 0; the magnetic field direction is switched suddenly from the z
direction .� D 0/ to some angle � f . The initial state before switching is spin down
(in the original basis). I write the initial state in terms of the new eigenkets as

</p>
<p>In this chapter, I have explored several techniques for obtaining approximate
</p>
<p>solutions to the time-dependent Schr&ouml;dinger equation when a time-dependent
</p>
<p>interaction is present. For weak interaction potentials, a perturbative approach can
</p>
<p>be used. Under certain conditions it is also possible to use adiabatic or sudden
</p>
<p>approximations. In general the adiabatic approximation is valid if the matrix
</p>

<p>Decay of a Discrete State into a Continuum
of States: Fermi&rsquo;s Golden Rule
</p>
<p>The last topics I will cover are Fermi&rsquo;s Golden Rule and irreversible decay. These are
</p>
<p>pretty interesting topics that involve situations in which a discrete state of a quantum
</p>
<p>system is coupled to an infinite continuum of quantum states. Although one starts
</p>
<p>with a Hermitian Hamiltonian, there is irreversible behavior in the system. This
</p>
<p>is approximately true in many cases of practical interest. For example, an atom that
</p>
<p>is prepared in an excited state decays as a result of its interaction with the continuum
</p>
<p>of vacuum field modes. A hydrogen atom placed in a high frequency optical field
</p>
<p>is photo-ionized into a continuum of (Coulomb modified) free-particle states. The
</p>
<p>reason we can get irreversible behavior in these cases is connected with the fact
</p>
<p>that the quantization volume goes to infinity. This feature in already seen in the
</p>
<p>quantum revivals of a wave packet in the infinite square square well discussed in
</p>
<p>Chap. 6. There are always quantum revivals, but the revival time goes to infinity as
</p>
<p>the well size approaches infinity. In other words, an outgoing wave packet can never
</p>
<p>be reflected back by the boundary of the quantization volume. In problems of this
</p>
<p>nature, I start by writing equations in which all states are discrete and then take the
</p>
<p>limit in which some of the states form a continuum.
</p>
<p>24.1 Discrete State Coupled to a Continuum
</p>
<p>The generic problem that I am interested in is illustrated in Fig. 24.1. A discrete
</p>
<p>state, labeled by 0 and having energy E0, is coupled to a large number of states
</p>
<p>labeled by n: Eventually, I take the limit of the number of states going to infinity
</p>
<p>and the energy spacing � between the states going to zero. In doing so I will replace
</p>
<p>any sums over n by an integral over energy using the prescription

<p>608 24 Decay of a Discrete State into a Continuum of States: Fermi&rsquo;s Golden Rule
</p>
<p>Fig. 24.1 Discrete state 0 coupled to a discrete continuum of states labeled by n. The energy
</p>
<p>difference between successive levels is �
</p>
<p>where �.E/ is referred to as the (energy) density of states. I have already calculated
</p>
<p>the density of states for the radiation field in Chap. 1 and for matter waves in Chap. 5.
</p>
<p>There are two general classes of problems in which levels schemes such as those
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 24.1 are encountered. In processes such as spontaneous emission, the
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian is of the form
</p>
<p>OH D OHatom C OHfield C OVAF; (24.2)
</p>
<p>where OHatom is the atomic Hamiltonian, OHfield is the (quantized) Hamiltonian for
the vacuum radiation field, and OVAF is the atom&ndash;field interaction potential. The
eigenstates of OHfield constitute the continuum levels of the problem. The atom is
prepared initially in some excited state and decays to a lower energy state as a result
</p>
<p>of the interaction with the vacuum field. In this problem, all operators are bona-fide,
</p>
<p>time-independent Schr&ouml;dinger operators.
</p>
<p>In the second class of problems such as photoionization, a time-dependent
</p>
<p>classical field drives an electron in an atom from some initial bound state to a
</p>
<p>continuum of unbound energy states. Although the ionized electron still sees a
</p>
<p>residual field from the ion that is left behind, it is sometimes a good approximation
</p>
<p>to consider the final states of the electron as free-particle states. The external field is
</p>
<p>assumed to have a constant amplitude and to oscillate at frequency !.
</p>
<p>In addressing both types of problems, I assume that at t D 0 the atom is prepared
in eigenket j0i and begins to make transitions to states jni : In the interaction
representation, the state amplitudes evolve according to

</p>
<p>Both the initial state amplitude and initial state probability undergo exponential

<p>Although the behavior is irreversible, the fact that the decay is exponential

<p>correlation time of the continuum of states giving rise to the decay is equal to

<p>zero. The delta function appearing in the integrand of Eq. (24.11) is a signature

<p>instant of time, the decay is independent of past events&mdash;it is always exponential.
</p>
<p>Of course, both �.E/ and V.E/ usually depend on energy. Moreover the energy
</p>
<p>spectrum is usually bounded from below since negative kinetic energies of particles
</p>
<p>and negative energies of photons are not allowed. As a consequence, the decay of
</p>
<p>a discrete state into the continuum can never be exactly exponential. However, to a
</p>
<p>very good approximation, processes such as spontaneous decay and particle decay
</p>
<p>can be represented as Markovian in nature. I will return to this point in discussing the
</p>
<p>Zeno effect later in this chapter. I will also discuss how the decay process is modified
</p>
<p>if the continuum is bounded from above and below. For the present, however, I
</p>
<p>consider two examples, photoionization and spontaneous decay.
</p>
<p>24.1.1 Photoionization
</p>
<p>As a first example of Fermi&rsquo;s Golden Rule, I consider the photoionization of
</p>
<p>hydrogen from its ground state produced by a high frequency (X-ray) radiation
</p>
<p>field. It is assumed that the frequency of the field is much greater than the ionization
</p>
<p>energy of hydrogen divided by h. In this limit, the electron that emerges can be
</p>
<p>treated in first approximation as a free particle. Moreover, since the matrix element
</p>
<p>involves a coupling from the ground state, the integral that determines the value</p>

<p>of the matrix element is restricted to radii on the order of the Bohr radius. As a

<p>24.1.2 Spontaneous Decay
</p>
<p>As a second example, I calculate the spontaneous emission rate at which an atom
</p>
<p>decays from an excited state to its ground state. To solve this problem it is necessary
</p>
<p>to quantize the radiation field since the continuum states that lead to decay are those
</p>
<p>of the vacuum field. You can find discussions of field quantization in most any book
</p>
<p>on quantum optics. I will not present any formal derivation of field quantization.
</p>
<p>A standard treatment involves the use of periodic boundary conditions for the field.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>Once the normal modes of the field are found (in this case, plane waves subject to
</p>
<p>periodic boundary conditions), creation and annihilation operators are assigned to
</p>
<p>each field mode. The net effect is that the Hamiltonian for the quantized field can be
</p>
<p>written as

<p>where V D L3 is the quantization volume and �kn is the field polarization unit vector.
There are two, independent polarizations for each k. The creation and destruction
</p>
<p>operators for the field are similar to those for the harmonic oscillator, having the
</p>
<p>same commutation relations. Instead of creating and destroying number states of
</p>
<p>the oscillator, they create and destroy photon states of the field. That is,

<p>a

</p>
<p>kn
j0i D j1kni ; (24.36)
</p>
<p>where j0i is the vacuum state and j1kni is a state with one photon in mode kn of the
field. These are the only states I need to discuss spontaneous decay.
</p>
<p>Rather than use Fermi&rsquo;s Golden Rule to derive an expression for the transition
</p>
<p>rate, I will calculate the state vector of the system as a function of time directly. The
</p>
<p>total Hamiltonian is given by
</p>
<p>OH D OHatom C OHfield C OVAF;
</p>
<p>where OHatom is the atomic Hamiltonian, OHfield is the free-field Hamiltonian given by
Eq. (24.33), and OVAF is the atom&ndash;field interaction potential given by
</p>
<p>OVAF D �Ope � E.R D 0/; (24.37)
</p>
<p>where Ope is the dipole moment operator of the atom. The nucleus of the atom is
assumed to be fixed at the origin.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 24.2 Spontaneous emission between an excited and ground state manifold of levels
</p>
<p>The eigenkets of OHatom are written as jn; Jn;mni; where Jn is the total angular
momentum of a manifold of levels in electronic state n and mn a magnetic quantum
</p>
<p>number associated with Jn. In practice I consider emission from a state j2; J2;m2i
which has been excited at time t D 0 to the manifold of ground states denoted
by j1; J1;m1i (see Fig. 24.2). The transition is driven by the atom-vacuum field
interaction. Of course, it is impossible to instantaneously excite the atom at a given
</p>
<p>time, so what I really mean is that the atom is excited in a time � that is much less
</p>
<p>than the decay rate of the system, but much longer than the inverse of the transition
</p>
<p>frequency. It is important not to forget that it is simply a vacuum field induced decay
</p>
<p>process with which we are dealing, since the algebra can get a little messy.
</p>
<p>Initially, the system is in the state j2; J2;m2I 0i where the 0 labels the vacuum
state of the field. In the interaction representation, it follows from Eq. (24.7a) that
</p>

</p>
<p>3This assumes that the reduced matrix element is independent of frequency as it is for atoms. For
</p>
<p>an oscillator, however, the square of the reduced matrix element varies inversely with the transition

<p>frequency such that the decay rate depends on the square of the transition frequency.</p>

<p>a measure of the spectral and directional properties of the emitted radiation (see
</p>
<p>problems).
</p>
<p>24.2 Bounded Continuum
</p>
<p>In many situations, the continuum is bounded. For example, in spontaneous decay,
</p>
<p>you cannot have emission at negative frequencies&mdash;the continuum is bounded from
</p>
<p>below at E D 0. When the continuum is bounded, there can never be purely
exponential decay and the exact solutions are very complicated. However, there are
</p>
<p>two limiting cases that can be solved approximately. If the energy of the continuum
</p>
<p>encompasses the discrete state (as it does in spontaneous emission since the discrete
</p>
<p>state has energy &bdquo;!0), and the width of the continuum is much larger than the
decay rate (as in spontaneous emission), then the decay is exponential to a very
</p>
<p>good approximation. In this limit, the infinite continuum model provides a good
</p>
<p>approximation to the exact result.
</p>
<p>The second case is very different. Imagine in the photoelectric effect that you
</p>
<p>send in a field having frequency !L for which &bdquo;!L is less than the work function
Ea D &bdquo;!a. In that case, you might think that the initial state amplitude remains equal
to unity and this is approximately true. But some of the initial state amplitude is lost.
</p>
<p>The situation is similar to that in off-resonant Rayleigh scattering, where there is a
</p>
<p>small, but non-vanishing, excited state probability amplitude. To model this effect,
</p>
<p>I take the zero of energy such that E0 D 0 and assume that the continuum extends
from energy Ea D &bdquo;!a to Eb D &bdquo;!b, with Eb &gt; Ea &gt; &bdquo;!L. In other words, the
field frequency is not sufficiently high to effectively drive transitions from the initial
</p>
<p>state into the continuum.
</p>
<p>The coupling matrix elements are taken as VE0.t/ D VE0 cos .!Lt/ : I assume
the effect of the field is sufficiently weak to allow me to solve Eq. (24.7b) with
</p>

for ˇ D 0:1 as a function of !aLt. The oscillations appear because the field is
turned on suddenly at t D 0. If, instead, the matrix coupling element is of the form
VE0.t/ D V.t/ cos .!Lt/, where V.t/ increases from an initial value of zero to a final
value of V in a time that is long compared with !�1aL , P0.t/ would not be oscillatory;
it would decay smoothly as 1�jV.t/j2 �= .4&bdquo;!aL/, assuming a final value of 1�ˇ=2,
instead of 1 � ˇ (see problems).
</p>
<p>If we apply this idea to photoionization with a field frequency below the
</p>
<p>ionization frequency, it looks like we violate energy conservation if an electron is
</p>
<p>ionized. Actually, the &ldquo;free&rdquo; electron amplitude oscillates rapidly between zero and
</p>
<p>a small value for each possible final energy state of the ionized electron. Thus the
</p>
<p>&ldquo;free&rdquo; electron cannot get very far away from the atom since each excited state
</p>
<p>returns to the initial state periodically. To measure the free electron you would
</p>
<p>have to make a measurement on a time scale less than the inverse of the oscillation</p>

<p>24.3 Zeno Paradox and Zeno Effect
</p>
<p>It has become fashionable for introductory and graduate quantum mechanics texts
</p>
<p>to mention the quantum Zeno paradox.4 The original Zeno paradoxes consist of a
</p>
<p>number of scenarios in which it appears that motion is impossible. For example, in
</p>
<p>the stadium paradox, the question is raised as to how long it will take to cross a
</p>
<p>stadium. To cross the stadium, you must first reach the midway point. But to reach
</p>
<p>the midway point, you must first reach the quarter way point, and so on. Since you
</p>
<p>have to reach an infinite number of points to cross the stadium, it will take you an
</p>
<p>infinite time to cross the stadium. The &ldquo;paradox&rdquo; is that you know it takes a finite
</p>
<p>time to cross the stadium. Although it is obvious to us that we can traverse an infinite
</p>
<p>number of points in a finite time, Zeno&rsquo;s paradoxes were troubling to the ancients&mdash;
</p>
<p>Aristotle spent considerable time trying to refute them.
</p>
<p>4See, for example, David Griffiths, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Second Edition (Pearson
</p>
<p>Prentiss Hall, Upper Saddle River, N.J., 2005) (Sect. 12.5) and Eugen Merzbacher, Quantum
</p>
<p>Mechanics, Third Edition (John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1998), Sect. 19.8.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24.3 Zeno Paradox and Zeno Effect 623
</p>
<p>Just like the ancients were confused by Zeno&rsquo;s paradoxes, it appears that
</p>
<p>the quantum Zeno paradox is confusing to contemporary scientists. Part of the
</p>
<p>reason for this is related to semantics. The quantum Zeno paradox was originally
</p>
<p>formulated by Misra and Sudarshan in terms of a bubble chamber experiment.5
</p>
<p>Imagine that an unstable particle enters a bubble chamber and leaves a track of
</p>
<p>bubbles. Each bubble is an indication that the particle has not yet decayed. In
</p>
<p>some sense, therefore, the bubbles constitute measurements in which the particle
</p>
<p>is projected into its original state. By increasing the bubble density, it would seem
</p>
<p>that the particle is continuously projected into its initial state&mdash;it does not decay at
</p>
<p>all! The paradox is that, in the experiment, the particle decays with its normal decay
</p>
<p>rate, independent of any bubbles. What is going on?
</p>
<p>I have shown that a Markovian decay process has no memory&mdash;decay is always
</p>
<p>exponential. For a Markovian process, you cannot change the decay rate, period.
</p>
<p>There is no Zeno paradox in this limit. The reason is simple. To modify the decay
</p>
<p>rate, you must act on the quantum system many times within the correlation time
</p>
<p>of the bath. For a Markovian process the correlation time of the bath giving rise
</p>
<p>to the relaxation is zero, so it is impossible to inhibit decay. Of course, no decay
</p>
<p>process is strictly Markovian. However, processes such as spontaneous emission and
</p>
<p>particle decay are close enough to Markovian to render any attempts to inhibit decay
</p>
<p>useless.
</p>
<p>Why, then, is there all this interest in the Zeno effect. I like to distinguish the
</p>
<p>Zeno effect from the Zeno paradox. I have just resolved the Zeno paradox&mdash;there
</p>
<p>can be no change in spontaneous decay rates produced by measurements on the
</p>
<p>system owing to the Markovian nature of the decay. On the other hand, there can be
</p>
<p>a Zeno effect for coherently driven transitions. I like to illustrate this by asking
</p>
<p>someone to explain something to me. As soon as she starts talking, I begin to
</p>
<p>yell gibberish so she must stop and begin the explanation anew. While not really
</p>
<p>an example of the quantum Zeno effect, it provides the central idea behind the
</p>
<p>effect. To cause a transition from one state to another, an interaction must build
</p>
<p>up a phase. We have already seen this in the optical Bloch equations where the
</p>
<p>application of a pulse having area equal to � leads to an inversion of a two level
</p>
<p>quantum system. If, during the pulse, you apply some other pulses, it is possible
</p>
<p>to inhibit the coherent build-up of the phase responsible for level inversion.6 There
</p>
<p>is nothing magical about this&mdash;in fact you often try to avoid processes that lead to
</p>
<p>phase decoherence. In certain quantum information protocols, you can reverse the
</p>
<p>effects of phase decoherence using the quantum Zeno effect, but this is not phase

<p>5B. Misra and E. C. G. Sudarshan, The Zeno&rsquo;s paradox in quantum theory, Journal of Mathematical
</p>
<p>Physics 18, 756&ndash;763 (1977).
6In fact, a revival of interest in the Zeno effect was generated by an article by W. M. Itano, D. J.
</p>
<p>Heinzen, J. J. Bollinger, and D. J. Wineland, Quantum Zeno effect, Physical Review 41, 2295&ndash;2300
</p>
<p>(1990). In that article, they showed that excitation of a long-lived state from the ground state using
</p>
<p>by a � pulse could be totally inhibited if an auxiliary field is used to drive a coupled ground to
</p>
<p>dipole-allowed optical transition. The observation of the spontaneously emitted radiation (or lack
</p>
<p>therof) on the dipole-allowed transition constituted the &ldquo;measurements&rdquo; on the atom.</p>

</p>
<p>decoherence caused by Markovian processes. Rather it is phase decoherence caused
</p>
<p>by effects such as fluctuating magnetic or electric fields whose coherence time is
</p>
<p>finite.
</p>
<p>Misra and Sudarshan proved that, under certain conditions, any quantum system
</p>
<p>can have its decay inhibited by continuously measuring the system. To understand
</p>
<p>their argument and to see why it fails for Markovian processes, imagine that there
</p>
<p>is a Hamiltonian OH that characterizes a quantum system in which some initial
discrete state j 0i is coupled to a continuum. We can ask for the probability that
we measure the quantum system in the state j 0i at time t, predicated on the fact
that we measured in state j 0i at times t1; t2 : : : tn. This probability is given by

<p>Misra and Sudarshan showed rigorously that P � 1 as n � 1, provided OH
is a Hermitian and semi-bounded operator (e.g., OH is semi-bounded if all its
eigenenergies are greater than or equal to some energy E0). In other words, in the
</p>
<p>limit of continuous measurement on the system, the initial state never decays! They
</p>
<p>then went on to say that a bubble chamber does not really constitute continuous
</p>
<p>measurement of the undecayed particle, which explains why the decay is not

<p>inhibited.

<p>There is no quantum Zeno effect for a Markovian process. Spontaneous emission
</p>
<p>is very close to a Markovian process, for which tc is of order of an inverse optical

<p>frequency, making it all but impossible to make &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; measurements on such
</p>
<p>a system.
</p>
<p>24.4 Summary
</p>
<p>The important problem of transitions from a discrete state to a continuum of
</p>
<p>states has been studied. In such cases, irreversible behavior can occur, such as that
</p>
<p>observed in photoemission and spontaneous decay. Fermi&rsquo;s Golden Rule can be used
</p>
<p>to evaluate the decay rate, although a better picture of the decay processes can be
</p>
<p>obtained by solving the equations of motion for the state amplitudes and forming
</p>
<p>the appropriate probability distributions for the final and initial states. Although it
</p>
<p>might appear to be possible to inhibit such decay by constant measurements on a
</p>
<p>quantum system, I have shown that this is not possible for Markovian processes.
</p>
<p>24.5 Problems
</p>
<p>1&ndash;2. Estimate the 2P�1S and the 2S�2P decay rates in hydrogen using Eq. (24.57).
You will need to use the Wigner-Eckart theorem and look up the wave functions and
</p>
<p>frequency spacings of the levels.
</p>
<p>3. For two fine structure levels within the same electronic state manifold, the ratio
</p>
<p>of the decay rates to some lower level is approximately equal to the ratio of cube
</p>
<p>of the transition frequencies of the two transitions. Estimate the ratio of the decay</p>

<p>9. An atom undergoes spontaneous decay with a central wavelength of 600 nm and
</p>
<p>a lifetime of 100 ns. Estimate the Rabi frequency if the field from this atom interacts
</p>
<p>with a similar atom one cm away. If, instead, the single photon pulse can be focused
</p>
<p>to an area of �2 when it strikes the atom, show that the Rabi frequency is of the
</p>
<p>order of the decay rate and the pulse area is of order unity; that is, a single photon

<p>pulse focused to a wavelength can fully excite an atom.

<p>Assume that the particle is in the ground state of the potential and, in addition,

<p>there is a perturbative contribution to the Hamiltonian of the form
</p>
<p>OV.x; t/ D ˛Ox cos .!t/ ;
</p>
<p>where &bdquo;! is much greater than the magnitude of the ground state energy and ˛ is
a constant. Calculate the rate at which the particle is &ldquo;ionized&rdquo; (escapes from the
</p>
<p>potential into unbound states). You can leave your answer in terms of the ground
</p>
<p>state energy E1 and an integral involving the ground state eigenfunction  E1.x/.
</p>
<p>You need not evaluate the integral. [Hint: To solve this problem, assume that the
</p>
<p>final states can be approximated as free particle states. You need to calculate the
</p>
<p>density of states for these free particle states in one-dimension.]
</p>
<p>12&ndash;13. In the calculation of Sect. 24.3 for a bounded continuum, I assumed that the
</p>
<p>field was turned on instantaneously at t D 0. Suppose, instead, that the coupling
matrix element is VE0.t/ D V.t/ cos .!Lt/, where V.t/ is a smooth function that
increases from an initial value of zero at t D 0 to a final value of V in some
characteristic time T . Repeat the calculation of Sect. 24.3 with !b D 1 and

occurs without oscillations if V.t/ is turned on adiabatically with respect to the

<p>628 24 Decay of a Discrete State into a Continuum of States: Fermi&rsquo;s Golden Rule
</p>
<p>Fig. 24.4 Level scheme for Problem 24.14. Level 3 is the 22P3=2 that decays back to level 1. The
</p>
<p>parameters shown refer to the article of Itano et al. In their experiment the uv pulse width was

<p>2.4 ms and up to N D 64 pulses were used
</p>
<p>Plot P0 as a function of !aLt for ˇ D jVj2 �= .2&bdquo;!aL/ D 0:1 and 1=!aLT D 0:1
and compare the result with the prediction of Eq. (24.72). There are still some very
</p>
<p>small oscillations owing to the fact that the derivative of V.t/ is not continuous at
</p>
<p>t D 0. Also plot P0 as a function of !aLt for ˇ D 0:1 and 1=!aLT D 40 (sudden
turn-on of field) and compare the result with that shown in Fig. 24.3. Note that the
</p>
<p>asymptotic value for P0.1/ is 1 � ˇ for a sudden turn-on of the field and 1 � ˇ=2
for an adiabatic turn on of the field. The parameter

</p>
<p>hyperfine levels of a Be ion is driven by a radio-frequency (rf) field. Let the initial
</p>
<p>state be denoted by 1 and the final state by 2. A � pulse having duration T D 256
ms transfers the population from state 1 to 2, assuming no other interactions played
</p>
<p>a role. To demonstrate a Zeno effect, Itano et al. added a number of ultraviolet
</p>
<p>pulses that could excite state 1 to a 22P3=2 level that undergoes rapid spontaneous
</p>
<p>decay back to level 1 on a time scale of order 10 ns. (see Fig. 24.4). The optical
</p>
<p>pulses are sufficiently long (but still have duration � T) and intense to insure
that several spontaneously emitted photons can be observed, provided the 22P3=2
level is excited during the pulse. The emission of the spontaneous radiation (or lack
</p>
<p>thereof) is said to effect a &ldquo;measurement&rdquo; on the atom. The ion &ldquo;collapses&rdquo; into
</p>
<p>state 1 if the emission occurs and into state 2 if no emission occurs (no emission
</p>
<p>implies the ion must have been in state 2 when the uv pulse was applied). If N such
</p>
<p>equally spaced pulses are applied, calculate the population of the initial 22S1=2 at
</p>
<p>time t D T . Show that in the limit N !1, this population approaches zero&mdash;there
is a Zeno effect produced by the measurement pulses. To carry out this calculation,
</p>
<p>you can assume that at t D 0 the Bloch vector is .u.0/; v.0/;w.0// D .0; 0;�1/.
Following the first measurement pulse at time t1, the Bloch vector &ldquo;collapses&rdquo; into
</p>
<p>.u.t1/; v.t1/;w.t1// D .0; 0;w.t1//, since there is a probability �11.t1/ that the

<p>ion is in state 1 and a probability �22.t1/ that the ion is in state 2 at the time of

<p>the measurement. The ion then evolves freely under the influence of the rf pulse

<p>until the second measurement pulse at time t2 &ldquo;collapses&rdquo; the Bloch vector into
