<p>Preface 
</p>
<p>This book is an outgrowth of lectures given at the University of Michigan at various 
</p>
<p>times from 1966-1996 in a first-year graduate course on quantum mechanics. It 
</p>
<p>is meant to be at a fairly high level. On the one hand, it should provide future 
</p>
<p>research workers with the tools required to solve real problems in the field. On the 
</p>
<p>other hand, the beginning graduate courses at the University of Michigan should 
</p>
<p>be self-contained. Although most of the students will have had an undergraduate 
</p>
<p>course in quantum mechanics, the lectures are intended to be such that a student 
</p>
<p>with no previous background in quantum mechanics (perhaps an undergraduate 
</p>
<p>mathematics or engineering major) can follow the course from beginning to end. 
</p>
<p>Part I of the course, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, thus begins with a 
</p>
<p>brief background chapter on the duality of nature, which hopefully will stimulate 
</p>
<p>students to take a closer look at the two references given there. These references 
</p>
<p>are recommended for every serious student of quantum mechanics. Chapter 1 is 
</p>
<p>followed by a review of Fourier analysis before we meet the SchrMinger equation 
</p>
<p>and its interpretation. The dual purpose of the course can be seen in Chapters 4 and 
</p>
<p>5, where an introduction to simple square well problems and a first solution of the 
</p>
<p>one-dimensional harmonic oscillator by Fuchsian differential equation techniques 
</p>
<p>are followed by an introduction to the Bargmann transform, which gives us an 
</p>
<p>elegant tool to show the completeness of the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions 
</p>
<p>and enables us to solve some challenging harmonic oscillator problems, (e.g., the 
</p>
<p>case of general n for problem 11). Early chapters (7 through 12) on the eigenvalue 
</p>
<p>problem are based on the coordinate representation and include detailed solutions 
</p>
<p>of the spherical harmonics and radial functions of the hydrogen atom, as well 
</p>
<p>as many of the soluble, one-dimensional potential problems. These chapters are 
</p>
<p>based on the factorization method. It is hoped the ladder step-up and step-down </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>VI Preface 
</p>
<p>operator approach of this method will help to lead the student naturally from 
</p>
<p>the SchrOdinger equation approach to the more modem algebraic techniques of 
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics, which are introduced in Chapters 13 to 19. The full Dirac 
</p>
<p>bra, ket notation is introduced in Chapter 13. These chapters also give the full 
</p>
<p>algebraic approach to the general angular momentum problem, SO(3) or SU(2), 
</p>
<p>the harmonic oscillator algebra, and the SO(2, 1) algebra. The solution for the latter 
</p>
<p>is given in problem 23, which is used in considerable detail in later chapters. The 
</p>
<p>problems often amplify the material of the course. 
</p>
<p>Part II of the course, Chapters 20 to 26, on time-independent perturbation theory, 
</p>
<p>is based on Fermi's view that most of the important problems of quantum mechan-
</p>
<p>ics can be solved by perturbative techniques. This part of the course shows how 
</p>
<p>various types of degeneracies can be handled in perturbation theory, particularly 
</p>
<p>the case in which a degeneracy is not removed in lowest order of perturbation 
</p>
<p>theory so that the lowest order perturbations do not lead naturally to the symmetry-
</p>
<p>adapted basis; a case ignored in many books on quantum mechanics and perhaps 
</p>
<p>particularly important in the case of accidental near-degeneracies. Chapters 25 
</p>
<p>and 26 deal with magnetic-field perturbations, including a short section on the 
</p>
<p>Aharanov-Bohm effect, and a treatment on fine structure and Zeeman perturbations 
</p>
<p>in one-electron atoms. 
</p>
<p>Part III of the course, Chapters 27 to 35, then gives a detailed treatment of 
</p>
<p>angular momentum and angular momentum coupling theory, including a derivation 
</p>
<p>of the matrix elements of the general rotation operator, Chapter 29; spherical 
</p>
<p>tensor operators, Chapter 31; the Wigner-Eckart theorem, Chapter 32; angular 
</p>
<p>momentum recoupling coefficients and their use in matrix elements of coupled 
</p>
<p>tensor operators in an angular-momentum-coupled basis, Chapter 34; as well as 
</p>
<p>the use of an SO(2,l) algebra and the stretched Coulombic basis and its power in 
</p>
<p>hydrogenic perturbation theory without the use of the infinite sum and continuum 
</p>
<p>integral contributions of the conventional hydrogenic basis, Chapter 35. 
</p>
<p>Since the full set of chapters is perhaps too much for a one-year course, some 
</p>
<p>chapters or sections, and, in particular, some mathematical appendices, are marked 
</p>
<p>in the table of contents with an asterisk (*). This symbol designates that the chapter 
</p>
<p>can be skipped in a first reading without loss of continuity for the reader. Chapters 
</p>
<p>34 and 35 are such chapters with asterisks. Because of their importance, however, 
</p>
<p>an alternative is to skip Chapters 36 and 37 on the WKB approximation. These 
</p>
<p>chapters are therefore placed at this point in the book, although they might well 
</p>
<p>have been placed in Part II on perturbation theory. 
</p>
<p>Part IV of the lectures, Chapters 38 to 40, gives a first introduction to systems 
</p>
<p>of identical particles, with the emphasis on the two-electron atom and a chapter 
</p>
<p>on variational techniques. 
</p>
<p>Parts I through IV of the course deal with bound-state problems. Part Von scat-
</p>
<p>tering theory, which might constitute the beginning of a second semester, begins 
</p>
<p>the treatment of continuum problems with Chapters 41 through 56 on scattering 
</p>
<p>theory, including a treatment of inelastic scattering processes and rearrangement 
</p>
<p>collisions, and the spin dependence of scattering cross sections. The polarization </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Preface vii 
</p>
<p>of particle beams and the scattering of particles with spin are used to introduce 
</p>
<p>density matrices and statistical distributions of states. 
</p>
<p>Part VI of the course gives a conventional introduction to time-dependent per-
</p>
<p>turbation theory, including a chapter on magnetic resonance and an application of 
</p>
<p>the sudden and adiabatic approximations in the reversal of magnetic fields. 
</p>
<p>Part VII on atom-photon interactions includes an expansion of the quantized 
</p>
<p>radiation field in terms of the full set of vector spherical harmonics, leading to a 
</p>
<p>detailed derivation of the general electric and magnetic multipole-transition matrix 
</p>
<p>elements needed in applications to nuclear transitions, in particular. 
</p>
<p>Parts V through IX may again be too much material for the second semester of 
</p>
<p>a one-year course. At the University of Michigan, curriculum committees have at 
</p>
<p>various times insisted that the first-year graduate course include either an introduc-
</p>
<p>tion to Dirac theory of relativistic spin ~ -particles or an introduction to many-body 
</p>
<p>theory. Part VIn of the course on relativistic quantum mechanics, Chapters 69 
</p>
<p>through 77, and Part IX, an introduction to many-body theory, Chapters 78 and 
</p>
<p>79, are therefore written so that a lecturer could choose either Part VIII or Part IX 
</p>
<p>to complete the course. 
</p>
<p>The problems are meant to be an integral part of the course. They are often 
</p>
<p>meant to build on the material of the lectures and to be real problems (rather than 
</p>
<p>small exercises, perhaps to derive specific equations). They are, therefore, meant 
</p>
<p>to take considerable time and often to be somewhat of a challenge. In the actual 
</p>
<p>course, they are meant to be discussed in detail in problem sessions. For this reason, 
</p>
<p>detailed solutions for a few key problems, particularly in the first part of the course, 
</p>
<p>are given in the text as part of the course (e.g., the results of problem 23 are very 
</p>
<p>much used in later chapters, and problem 34, actually a very simple problem in 
</p>
<p>perturbation theory is used to illustrate how various types of degeneracies can be 
</p>
<p>handled properly in perturbation theory in a case in which the underlying symmetry 
</p>
<p>leading to the degeneracy might not be easy to recognize). In the case of problem 
</p>
<p>34, the underlying symmetry is easy to recognize. The solution therefore also 
</p>
<p>shows how this symmetry should be exploited. 
</p>
<p>The problems are not assigned to specific chapters, but numbered 1 through 55 
</p>
<p>for Parts I through IV of the course, and, again, 1 through 51 for Parts V through 
</p>
<p>IX, the second semester of the course. They are placed at the point in the course 
</p>
<p>where the student should be ready for a particular set of problems. 
</p>
<p>The applications and assigned problems ofthese lectures are taken largely from 
</p>
<p>the fields of atomic and molecular physics and from nuclear physics, with a few 
</p>
<p>examples from other fields. This selection, of course, shows my own research 
</p>
<p>interests, but I believe, is also because these fields are fertile for the applications 
</p>
<p>of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. 
</p>
<p>I first of all want to acknowledge my own teachers. I consider myself extremely 
</p>
<p>fortunate to have learned the subject from David M. Dennison and George E. 
</p>
<p>Uhlenbeck. Among the older textbooks used in the development of these lectures, 
</p>
<p>I acknowledge the books by Leonard I. Schiff, Quantum Mechanics, McGraw-Hill, 
</p>
<p>1949; Albert Messiah, Quantum Mechanics, Vol. I and l/, John Wiley and Sons, 
</p>
<p>1965; Eugene Merzbacher, Quantum Mechanics, John Wiley and Sons, 1961; Kurt </p>

</p>

</p>
<p>books have found their way into my lectures. 
</p>
<p>References to specific books, chapters of books, or research articles are given 
</p>
<p>throughout the lectures wherever they seemed to be particularly useful or relevant. 
</p>
<p>Certainly, no attempt is made to give a complete referencing. Each lecturer in 
</p>
<p>a course on quantum mechanics must give the student his own list of the many 
</p>
<p>textbooks a student should consult. The serious student of the subject, however, 
</p>
<p>must become familiar with the two classics: P. A. M. Dirac, The Principles of 
</p>
<p>Quantum Mechanics, Oxford University Press, first ed. 1930; and Wolfgang Pauli, 
</p>
<p>General Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Springer-Verlag, 1980, (an English 
</p>
<p>translation of the 1933 Handbuch der Physik article in Vol. 24 of the Handbuch). 
</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank the many students at the University of Michigan who have 
</p>
<p>contributed to these lectures with their questions. In fact, it was the encouragement 
</p>
<p>of former students of this course that has led to the idea these lectures should 
</p>
<p>be converted into book form. I also thank Prof. Yasuyuki Suzuki for his many 
</p>
<p>suggestions after a careful reading of an early version of the manuscript. Particular 
</p>
<p>thanks are due to Dr. Sudha Swaminathan and Dr. Frank Lamelas for their great 
</p>
<p>efforts in making all of the figures. </p>

<p>Background: The Duality of Nature 
</p>
<p>(Good references for this chapter on the historical background are the article 
</p>
<p>by Niels Bohr, entitled "Discussions with Einstein. Epistemological Problems in 
</p>
<p>Atomic Physics." In Albert Einstein. Philosopher-Scientist. Vol. VII of Library of 
</p>
<p>Living Philosophers, Paul A. Schilpp, ed., Evanston, Illinois, 1949; and the lit-
</p>
<p>tle book by Werner Heisenberg, The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory, 
</p>
<p>Dover Publications, 1949.) 
</p>
<p>The results of the experimental developments of the late nineteenth and early 
</p>
<p>twentieth century led us to a picture of nature that showed the duality of nature on 
</p>
<p>the atomic scale. Both material particles and electromagnetic radiation show both 
</p>
<p>particle-like and wave-like aspects. However, particles can be localized in space-
</p>
<p>time. In classical physics, x,y,z,t for a particle can be specified exactly. Particles are 
</p>
<p>also indivisible. Half an electron, or a fractional part of an electron, does not exist. 
</p>
<p>On the other hand, waves cannot be localized. They must be somewhat extended in 
</p>
<p>space-time to give a meaning to wavelength, A, and frequency, v. Waves are always 
</p>
<p>divisible. Partial reflection and transmission of a wave at an interface between two 
</p>
<p>media can exist. 
</p>
<p>This duality poses a real dilemma: The particle picture seems incompatible 
</p>
<p>with that of waves, in particular, the interference effects. Yet, ill is precisely the 
</p>
<p>interference effects that determine A and v, which via the deBroglie relation, p = 
</p>
<p>h / A, and the Bohr relation, E = h v, determine the dynamical attributes of the 
</p>
<p>particle. </p>

<p>To illustrate the paradoxical situation, consider the classical interference experi-
</p>
<p>ment of the Young double slit. We could think either oflight waves, electromagnetic 
</p>
<p>radiation, or of matter waves, electron deBroglie waves, going through the double 
</p>
<p>slit arrangement. 
</p>
<p>The incident beam can be made so weak that, on average, only one photon (or 
</p>
<p>electron) at a time will pass through the apparatus and be incident on the pho-
</p>
<p>tographic plate. Because only one photon at a time goes through the apparatus, 
</p>
<p>the possibility of interference between different photons is eliminated. An inter-
</p>
<p>ference pattern will still be on the photographic plate, however. Clearly, a photon 
</p>
<p>that has reached the photographic plate must have passed through either slit 1 or 
</p>
<p>slit 2. Imagine it was slit 1; then, if slit 2 had been closed, no interference pattern 
</p>
<p>would have occurred. Hence, the seemingly terrible paradox that the behavior of 
</p>
<p>the photon is influenced by the presence of a slit, through which it cannot have 
</p>
<p>passed. 
</p>
<p>The resolution of the paradox rests on the fact that the classical causal space-
</p>
<p>time description of nature which rests on the "clear-cut separability between the 
</p>
<p>phenomena and the means of observing these phenomena," does not apply. On the 
</p>
<p>atomic scale, an "uncontrollable interaction between the object and the measuring 
</p>
<p>instrument" exists. (The words in quotation marks are those of Niels Bohr.) As 
</p>
<p>a result, the above experiment can be set up in either of two "complementary" 
</p>
<p>ways; as above, and as shown in Fig. 1.1, to exhibit the interference fringes but in 
</p>
<p>a setup that makes it impossible to answer experimentally the question: "Through 
</p>
<p>which slit did the photon pass?". Alternatively, we could alter the experimental 
</p>
<p>setup to answer experimentally the question: "Through which slit did the photon 
</p>
<p>pass?" In setting up the experiment in this second way, however, we have lost the 
</p>
<p>possibility of a precise wavelength measurement through the interference pattern. 
</p>
<p>The interference pattern will have been wiped out. 
</p>
<p>Because our know ledge of phenomena on the atomic scale is restricted, a wave-
</p>
<p>field must be associated with the particle motion. For any wavefield, an uncertainty 
</p>
<p>relation exists connecting position and wavelength; 8..k 8..x ~ 2;rr, where k = 
</p>
<p>2;rr I)... This relation follows from straightforward Fourier analysis of a wave packet 
of finite extent in space. Now, with the deBroglie relation, p = hi).., this leads to 
</p>
<p>8..p8..x ~ h, the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. 
</p>
<p>B More Detailed Analysis of the Double Slit 
</p>
<p>Experiment 
</p>
<p>In region I, to the left of the single slit (see Fig. 1.1), we assume we have a 
</p>
<p>plane wave effectively of infinite extent in the y direction and proceeding in the 
</p>
<p>x direction. Then, in region I, py = 0; i. e., py is known precisely, so 8..Py = 0; </p>

</p>
<p>now, we have no knowledge of where the photon is located in space, ~Y = 00. 
The y position of the particle is completely uncertain. 
</p>
<p>At the position of the double slit (with massive, rigidly fixed slits bolted to 
</p>
<p>massive apparatus; see the figures in the article by Bohr), no experimental means 
</p>
<p>of determining through which slit the photon is passing exist. It must go through 
</p>
<p>either of the two slits. Hence, at this x-position, ~Y ~ d. In its passage through 
</p>
<p>one of the slits, the photon will interact with the slit jaw, which is massive, bolted 
</p>
<p>firmly to a huge apparatus, and it can absorb recoil momentum without moving. 
</p>
<p>Most of the photons end up within the first few bright fringes near the central 
</p>
<p>maximum. We cannot predict which fringe, however. Let us assume the photon 
</p>
<p>ends up in the nth bright fringe, where n is a small integer. Then, the change in py 
</p>
<p>at the double slit position is

<p>C Complementary Experimental Setup 
</p>
<p>(6) 
</p>
<p>The question now arises: Could we have modified the experimental setup at the 
</p>
<p>x-position of the double slit to narrow the uncertainty in y at this x-position? In 
</p>
<p>particular, could we have modified the experimental setup to answer experimentally 
</p>
<p>the question: Through which slit did the photon pass? We could do this by making 
</p>
<p>the slit jaws movable, so the momentum exchange between photon and slit jaw 
</p>
<p>could be detected. Bohr imagines the very light slit jaws being suspended from 
</p>
<p>springs, so the photon will jiggle the slit as it goes through the slit opening. (See 
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.2, drawn in the style of the Bohr article.) Imagine the photon ends up at 
</p>
<p>the position where the central interference maximum would have occured in the 
</p>
<p>conventional double slit experiment, (with the apparatus of Fig. 1.1, that is, at the 
</p>
<p>most likely final position of the photon for the experimental setup of Fig. 1.1).

</p>
<p>where (Yl Yo) is the distance between the first and zeroth (central) bright fringe in 
</p>
<p>the interference pattern of the conventional experimental setup. This actual change 
</p>
<p>in the photon's momentum at the position of the slits would now lead to a recoil in 
</p>
<p>the slit jaws, which can be detected. An uncertainty will still exist in the y-position 
</p>
<p>of the photon as it passes through the slit, because of this jiggling of the slit; even 
</p>
<p>though our jiggle detectors can tell us through which slit the photon has passed (so 
</p>
<p>Ay &laquo; d). Now, let us use the uncertainty relation to detennine the best possible 
L'l.y caused by to the jiggling of the slit,

<p>h h x 2(Yl - Yo) 
L'l.y ;0::; - ;:::; --~~~-~~~~.-- = 2(Yl - yo). (8) 
</p>
<p>L'l.py h 
</p>
<p>That is, L'l.y is of thc order of the distance between bright fringes in the conventional 
</p>
<p>double slit setup. This Ay, however, is now due to the jiggling of the slit. If the 
</p>
<p>slit jiggles on average by an amount equal to the distance between interference 
</p>
<p>fringes, the interierence pattern on the photographic plate will surely be washed out </p>

<p>completely. In answering experimentally the question through which slit did the 
</p>
<p>photon pass, we have by altering the experimental setup destroyed those features 
</p>
<p>of the setup that previously made the precise wavelength measurement possible. 
</p>
<p>This illustrates Bohr's complementarity principle. We can set up the double slit 
</p>
<p>experiment to get very precise wavelength (hence, momentum) information about 
</p>
<p>the photon. In this case, we cannot make a position measurement of the photon 
</p>
<p>precise enough to tell us through which slit the photon passed. Alternatively, if we 
</p>
<p>use the complementary experimental setup, which can answer this question about 
</p>
<p>the position of the photon experimentally, we cannot determine: the wavelength 
</p>
<p>(hence, momentum) of the photon with sufficient accuracy. 
</p>
<p>Because we can have only partial position and partial momentum information 
</p>
<p>about a photon or a material particle on the atomic scale, it becomes natural to 
</p>
<p>associate a wave packet with the motion of the particle (either photon or material 
</p>
<p>particle). A wave packet can give us partial position and wavelength (or wave-
</p>
<p>number k) information through the wave packet relation, I'l.ky /).Y :::::: 2:n:, which

<p>The Motion of Wave Packets: Fourier 
Analysis 
</p>
<p>Because we will need to work with wave packets of finite extent, it will be very 
</p>
<p>useful to first give a brief review of Fourier analysis. 
</p>
<p>A Fourier Series 
</p>
<p>We shall start by studying periodic functions of infinite extent in space. First con-
</p>
<p>sider periodic functions f (x) with a periodicity interval 2rr, such that f (x + 2rr) = 
f (x). For real functions f (x), we usually use Fourier expansions in cosine and sine 
functions. For the complex functions of quantum theory, it will be advantageous 
</p>
<p>to use a Fourier expansion in exponential functions. 
</p>
<p>1. Fourier Expansion: 
</p>
<p>00 
</p>
<p>f(x) = L aneinx , 
n=-oo 
</p>
<p>where we will exploit the orthogonality of the exponential functions.

-7f 
</p>
<p>(1) 
</p>
<p>(2) 
</p>
<p>which is expressed in terms of the usual Kronecker delta. With this orthogonality 
</p>
<p>relation, the expansion coefficients, all, can be determined via the Fourier inversion 
</p>
<p>theorem. If we multiply f(x) by the complex conjugate of a specific exponential, 
</p>
<p>say, e-imx , with some specific, fixed m, and integrate both sides of the resultant </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>

functions can be expressed as

<p>The Schr6dinger Wave Equation and

<p>A The Wave Equation 
</p>
<p>With the Bohr relation for the energy, E = liw, and the deBroglie relation for the 
</p>
<p>momentum vector, p = lik, we see the dispersion relation for waves, w = I(k), 
goes over to a relation between energy and momentum. For a conservative system, 
</p>
<p>this relation can be expressed through E = H(p, r), where H is the Hamiltonian 
</p>
<p>function. In particular, for a free, nonrelativistic particle, of mass m, this "dispersion 
</p>
<p>relation" becomes 
</p>
<p>E = (p. p).

</p>

<p>E2

c2 
</p>
<p>would lead us to a wave equation both second order in time and space derivatives, 
</p>
<p>and again involving a single wave function \II(r, t). (See Problem 2). This equa-
</p>
<p>tion leads to the so-called Klein-Gordon equation. An alternative solution for the 
</p>
<p>relativistic wave equation was given by Dirac, whose wave equation is first order 
</p>
<p>in both time and space derivatives. Essentially, it comes from the square root of 
</p>
<p>the above dispersion relation and, therefore, leads to both positive and negative 
</p>
<p>energy solutions. It is based not on a single \II, but on a number of 1/1 a, actually, 
with a = 1, ... , 4. We shall come back to the Dirac equation near the end of the 
book. 
</p>
<p>B The Probability Axioms 
</p>
<p>To use the Schrodinger wave equation, we need to understand the physical meaning 
</p>
<p>of the wave function, \II. We begin with a few remarks: 
</p>
<p>1. The particle and the wavefield are equally real. (The wavefield is not a ghost 
</p>
<p>field guiding the particle.) Both are pictures in the human mind to account for 
</p>
<p>physical reality; both, however, have their limitations. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>B The Probability Axioms 21 
</p>
<p>2. In practice, the wavefield is used in the following way: The result of a certain 
</p>
<p>experiment lets us represent the particle motion by a wave packet at a certain time. 
</p>
<p>The wave equation is then used to predict how the experiment t:volves in time. 
</p>
<p>3. Because of the uncontrollable interaction of object and measuring instrument, 
</p>
<p>we are led to a probability description. 
</p>
<p>The probability of finding a particle within a volume element dxdydz about a 
</p>
<p>point x, y, z at a time t, will be given by 
</p>
<p>W(x, y, z; t)dxdydz, 
</p>
<p>where W(x, y, z; t) is a probability density. This probability density must satisfy 
</p>
<p>certain sensibility restrictions; i.e., W(x, y, z; t) must be a sensible probability 
</p>
<p>density: 
</p>
<p>W:::,:o. (12) 
</p>
<p>A negative probability density makes no sense. To make W patently positive, it 
</p>
<p>makes sense to let the probability density be given by 
</p>
<p>W(r; t) = qJ*\II. (13) 
</p>
<p>Note, in optics or electromagnetism, physically measurable quantities, such as 
</p>
<p>energy or intensity, are proportional to the square of the amplitUde of the wave, or 
</p>
<p>if the amplitude can be complex to the absolute value squared. Also, 
</p>
<p>dl ~ ~ - dr W(r, t) = O. 
dt all space 
</p>
<p>(14) 
</p>
<p>The probability of finding the particle somewhere is independent of time. In non-
</p>
<p>relativistic quantum mechanics, we are building a theory of indestructible particles. 
</p>
<p>Also, 
</p>
<p>1 dr W is Galilean invariant. 
all space 
</p>
<p>(15) 
</p>
<p>All observers agree one particle exists somewhere. 
</p>
<p>The conservation of probability leads to a continuity equation. Because qJ can 
</p>
<p>be complex, the SchrOdinger equation is really two equations 
</p>
<p>Ii a\ll li2 2 
--- = --V \II + V\II 
</p>
<p>i at 2m 
+~ a\ll* = _~V2\11* + V\II*. 
</p>
<p>i at 2m 
(16) 
</p>
<p>Multiplying the first of these equations by - \11*, the second equation by \II, and 
</p>
<p>adding the two resultant equations, assuming also the potential function is real, we 
</p>
<p>get 
</p>

<p>22 3. The SchrOdinger Wave Equation and Probability Interpretation 
</p>
<p>This relation has the form of a continuity equation

</p>
<p>(18) 
</p>
<p>(19) 
</p>
<p>where this equation must be interpreted as a probability density current; i.e., as the 
</p>
<p>probability per second per unit area normal to the direction of S that the particle 
be streaming in the direction of S. The integral form of the continuity equation 
could be written as 
</p>
<p>~ r drlll*1II + r dA(S . ti) = 0, 
dt iVol isurf. 
</p>
<p>(20) 
</p>
<p>where the volume integral is over a finite volume and the surface integral is over the 
</p>
<p>surface surrounding this finite volume, dA being an element of surface area and n 
</p>
<p>being the outward normal to the surface. In integral form, this equation says: The 
</p>
<p>time rate of change of probability of finding the particle within the finite volume 
</p>
<p>must be the negative of the probability of the net outflow of the particle. If we let 
</p>
<p>the volume grow to include all of our 3-D space and if we assume 111 and 111* ~ 0 
</p>
<p>sufficiently fast as a function of r as the surface recedes to infinity, the surface 
</p>
<p>integral will go to zero and our second probability restriction is satisfied. 
</p>
<p>Finally, examine the Galilean invariance. Suppose observers in a primed 
</p>
<p>reference frame are moving with velocity, v, parallel to the x-direction. Then, 
</p>
<p>x = x' + vt', y = y', I z = z, t = t ' , (21) 
</p>
<p>with 
</p>
<p>a a a a a a a a a a 
- = l-+v-, -=1-+0-, - - - , = (22) 
at' at ax ax' ax at ay' ay az l az 
</p>
<p>In addition, the wave function must also change under the Galilean transformation, 
</p>
<p>according to 
</p>
<p>'( I') III'(X', y', Z'; t') = lII(x, y, z; t)e-;; mvx- 2mv t &bull; (23) 
</p>
<p>Comparing the Schrodinger equations in the primed and unprimed frames, we are 
</p>
<p>led to 
</p>
<p>W'=W; S' = S - v 111 * 111. (24) 
If observers in the unprimed frame see no streaming of probability to right or left, 
</p>
<p>(S) = 0, observers in the primed frame will see a streaming to the left, as they 
</p>
<p>should because a particle in a region with W -=I 0 will appear to be moving in the 
direction of -v to an observer in the prim~d frame. 
</p>
<p>A final remark: If 111 is real everywhere, S is zero everywhere; then, no transport 
</p>
<p>of probability exists. A probability density with a real 111 corresponds to a situation 
</p>
<p>in which particles will stream in the +x and -x directions with equal probability. </p>

<p>Quantities 
</p>
<p>On the atomic scale, we cannot give an exact orbit description, e,g., x(t), for the

<p>The question then arises, how do we define the corresponding expectation value of

<p>The same type of Fourier transformation can also be used to express the

</p>
<p>F Operational Calculus, The Linear Operators of 
</p>
<p>Quantum Mechanics, Hilbert Space 
</p>
<p>In the last few sections, we have met many operators acting on the Schrodinger \lI. 
</p>
<p>In this section, we want to make a more systematic study of the linear operators of 
</p>
<p>quantum theory. The operator, 0, is a command. Acting on a function, it produces 
</p>
<p>anotherfunction, (O\ll(x). Examples include 0 = f(x). Acting on the function 
\lI(x), it produces the new function, f(x)\lI(x). The command is: Multiply the old 
</p>
<p>function by f(x). The second common example is the operator J~. When acting 
</p>
<p>on the function \lI, it produces the new function 
</p>
<p>d\ll (x) 
</p>
<p>dx 
</p>
<p>The operators of quantum theory are linear operators. When acting on functions 
</p>
<p>W(x), which are linear combinations of functions, \lI(x) = ,lq \lI1 (x) + A2 \lI2(X), 
where 1'1 and A2 are arbitrary complex numbers, the linear operator 0 yields 
</p>
<p>(52) 
</p>
<p>Another type of operator is the parity or space-inversion operator, P. It is the 
</p>
<p>command: Change x to --- x, Y to-y, and z to - z in the function on which it acts 
</p>
<p>P\lI(x, y, z) = \lI(-x, -y, -z). 
</p>
<p>Products of operators are operators acting in succession on our functions: </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28 3. The Schrodinger Wave Equation and Probability Interpretation 
</p>
<p>Because we deal with wave functions and operators acting on wave functions, 
</p>
<p>we need to define the function space on which the operators act. The wave functions 
</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics are square-integrable in coordinate space. 
</p>
<p>f drlli*1li = finite. (53) 
The space of all square-integrable functions is known as a Hilbert space. It will be 
</p>
<p>useful to define a Scalar Product of the functions &lt;P and Ili by 
</p>
<p>f dr&lt;P*1li =&lt; &lt;P, Ili &gt; . (54) 
The functions &lt;P and Ili are said to be orthogonal to each other if &lt; &lt;P, Ili &gt;= O. 
</p>
<p>Note, the scalar product has the property 
</p>
<p>&lt; &lt;P, Ili &gt;=&lt; Ili, &lt;P &gt;* . (55) 
</p>
<p>Note also, the scalar product is linear in Ili, 
</p>
<p>&lt; &lt;P, Allli l + A21li2 &gt;= Al &lt; &lt;P, Ili l &gt; +A2 &lt; &lt;P, 1li2 &gt;, (56) 
</p>
<p>but is antilinear in &lt;P, 
</p>
<p>&lt; Al &lt;PI + A2&lt;P2, Ili &gt;= A~ &lt; &lt;PI, I{! &gt; +A~ &lt; &lt;P l , I{! &gt; . (57) 
</p>
<p>Eq. (56) follows from the linear character of the unit operator. 
</p>
<p>An important concept is the Adjoint of an Operator, written as oj.

<p>Thus, if an operator, 0, commutes with the Hamiltonian, H, and is not an explicit 
</p>
<p>function of the time, the time derivative of its expectation value in any state, Ill, 
</p>
<p>is equal to zero. This operator is the quantum-mechanical analogue of a classical 
</p>
<p>"integral" of the motion. The operator, 0, is conserved. 
</p>
<p>The simplest example, as in classical physics, is the Hamiltonian operator itself, 
</p>
<p>provided it is not an explicit function of the time. For such a Hamiltonian, the 
</p>
<p>conserved value of H is the energy E, as in classical physics. As a second example, 
</p>
<p>consider single-particle motion in a central force field, with 
</p>
<p>I ~ ~ 
H = 2m (p . p) + VCr), (77) 
</p>
<p>where the potential function is a function of the scalar r only, where r2 = x 2 + 
y2 + Z2. (Note, we could also have chosen the two-body system with a central 
interaction, provided we replace m by the reduced mass and r stands for the 
relative vector, r1 - r2; see the next section). In this case, the three components of 
the orbital angular momentum vector, 
</p>
<p>(78) 
</p>
<p>are conserved quantities. For example, 
</p>
<p>[H, Lx] = [H, (ypz - ZPy)] = y[H, pzl + [H, y]pz - z[H, py] - [H, z]Py 
= y[V, pz] + 2~ [p;, y]pz - z[V, py] - 2~ [p;, z]Py

<p>Similarly,

<p>mechanically, we must convert this into a hermitian operator by using the sym-

<p>Note, PvLz is not a hermitian operator, because Pv does not commute with 
</p>
<p>L;:. = (xpy - YPx). The symmetrized form of this ~perator, !(pyLz + Lzpy), 
however, is hermitian. In making the transition from classical physics quantities to 
</p>
<p>quantum-mechanical operators, the hermitian, symmetrized form of the classical 
</p>
<p>quantities will often give the needed quantum-mechanical operators. The proof 
</p>
<p>that [H, Rkl = 0, where H is the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian, will be left as an 
</p>
<p>exercise (part of problem 13). 
</p>
<p>As a final example of a conserved operator, consider the space inversion or parity

<p>operator, P, where

<p>For a Hamiltonian,

<p>Jj2

<p>P\II(x, y, z, t) = \l1(-x, -y, -z, t). (86)

<p>H = __ V2 + V(x, y, z), 
2m 
</p>
<p>with V(-x, -y, -z) = V(x, y, z), (87)

<p>that is, with a potential that is space-inversion invariant, we have

<p>(H P - P H)\l1(r, t) = 0 (89)

<p>for all \II of our Hilbert space. Hence, [H, Pl = 0, and P is a conserved quantity. 
Finally, note also, P is a hermitian operator, because 
</p>
<p>f dr\ll*(i, t)P\II(r, t) = f dr\l1*(r, t)\II(-r, t) = f dr\l1*(-r, t)\II(r, t) </p>

<p>J Quantum-Mechanical Hamiltonians for More General Systems 33

<p>where we have made the change of variables, x ---+ -x, y ---+ -- y, Z ---+ - z, and 
</p>
<p>have changed the order of the integration limits in the three integrals implied by 
</p>
<p>our shorthand notation in the last step of the first line. We see pi = P. Therefore, 
the expectation value of the operator P must also be real. Finally, because 
</p>
<p>the operator p2 has an expectation value of I. The real expectation value of the 
</p>
<p>operator P can thus be only either + 1 or -1. The solutions of the Schrodinger 
equation for the space-inversion invariant Hamiltonian of eq. (87) must thus ei-
</p>
<p>ther be unchanged or change sign under the space-inversion operation. The wave 
</p>
<p>function must have even or odd parity. 
</p>
<p>J Quantum-Mechanical Hamiltonians for More General 
</p>
<p>Systems 
</p>
<p>As an example of a slightly more general system, consider a particle of mass, m, 
</p>
<p>and charge, e, moving in an electromagnetic field derivable from a vector potential, 
</p>
<p>,.1(i), and a scalar potential, &cent;l(i). The classical Hamiltonian is given by 
</p>
<p>(90) 
</p>
<p>This relation can be written in the form 
</p>
<p>(p . p) e ~ _ ~ ~ e2 ~-. 
H = -- - -(p. A + A&middot; p) -+ --A&middot; A + e&cent;l. (91) 
</p>
<p>2m 2mc 2mc2 
</p>
<p>Note, because in general [Px, Ax] i 0, we have written the scalar product of A 
with p in symmetrized, hermitian form, so the Hamiltonian in the second form is 
a candidate for the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of this system. This relation 
</p>
<p>is indeed the correct quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian. The predictions based on 
</p>
<p>this form of the Hamiltonian are in agreement with the experiment! (We shall 
</p>
<p>study this system in more detail later, where we will discuss the role of the gauge 
</p>
<p>of the potentials, the gauge transformation, the Aharanov-Bohm effect, etc.) For 
</p>
<p>more complicated systems, however, the simple process of symmetrization of a 
</p>
<p>classical Hamiltonian may not be sufficient, particularly if the physically relevant 
</p>
<p>coordinates are a set of complicated curvilinear coordinates, say, in the case of a 
</p>
<p>many-body system in which some of the degrees of freedom arc "frozen" or do

of the relative r only (no external fields). In this case, the center of mass motion

the center of mass motion, Etrans! = p2 /2(m 1 + m2). The Schrodinger equation is

<p>In n-particlc systems, it will be useful to transform from the coordinates 
</p>
<p>Xl, &bull;.. ,ZI1 to a set of generalized coordinates qs' Often, some of these will not 
</p>
<p>come into play. In a polyatomic molecule, e.g., the ammonia molecule, NH3 , we 
</p>
<p>have a system with 4 atomic nuclei and 10 electrons, a 14-particle system with 
</p>
<p>42 degrees of freedom (assuming we can neglect the electron and nuclear spins). 
</p>
<p>These coordinates could be chosen as the 3 center of mass coordinates, which 
</p>
<p>merely describe the free-particle translation of the whole system in space: 3 angu-
</p>
<p>lar coordinates, say, three Euler angles, &cent;, e, X, which describe the orientation of 
the molecule in space and describe the rotational motion of the molecule; 6 rela-
</p>
<p>tive coordinates, which describe the relative motions of the atomic nuclei, that is, 
</p>
<p>the vibrational motions of the molecule; and finally 3 x 10 electronic coordinates </p>

</p>
<p>tions of the molecule. At very low excitation energies, only the rotational degrees 
</p>
<p>of freedom, cp, 8, X, may need to be considered. Therefore, if we can transform 
the general 3n = 42-dimensional Laplacian operator of this 14-particle system 
</p>
<p>from the 3 x 14 Cartesian coordinates to the physically relev,mt 42 generalized 
</p>
<p>coordinates, qs, including cp, 8, X, we arrive at the desired Schr6dinger equation, 
if the variations with all qs are neglected, except for the variations with the needed 
</p>
<p>cp, 8, X. Even for the I&middot;&middot; particle system, it will generally be useful to express the 
Schr6dinger equation not in terms of the Cartesian coordinates x, y, z, but in tenns 
of some set of curvilinear coordinates, e.g., spherical coordinates r, 8, cp.

<p>quantum-mechanical Hamiltoni&lt;m. We know, however, how to transform the 30-

<p>dimensional Laplacian operator from its Cartesian form to the form involving 
</p>
<p>partial derivatives with respect to the new generalizcd q,. Therefore, we can write 
</p>
<p>the proper Schrodinger equation. We need, in addition to the g'j, the function g,

<p>4. In describing scattering processes of complex projectiles from nuclei, it is

<p>Assuming other degrees of freedom, such as vibrational, translational, and elec-

<p>the SchrOdinger equation for the rigid rotator (asymmetric case, A # B # C). 
For the symmetric rotator, with A = B, show the time-independent wave function

</p>
<p>solutions for regions with E &gt; V and simple exponentials for regions with E &lt; V. 
</p>
<p>The simplest 1-D problem is that of a single, attractive square well of width 2a,

<p>with 
</p>
<p>Vex) = 0 for - a ~ x ~ +a, Vex) = +Vo for Ixl &gt; a,

</p>
<p>In order to have square-integrable solutions, the 1{I(x) must be restricted to 
</p>
<p>exponentially decaying solutions outside the potential well; i.e., 
</p>
<p>1{I(x) = Ce- KX for x &gt; +a, 1{I(x) = De+KX for x &lt; -a. (9) 
</p>
<p>In the interior, for -a ~ x ~ +a, the most general solution is 
</p>
<p>1{I(x) = A coskx + B sinkx. 
</p>
<p>(For the moment, we have not made use of the symmetry of the potential.) In 
</p>
<p>order to have solutions with sensible probability densities, both the probability 
</p>
<p>density and the probability density currents must be continuous functions of x. 
</p>
<p>This solution can be ensured by requiring the continuity of both 1{1 (x) and its first 
</p>
<p>derivative at the discontinuities of the potential atx = &plusmn;a. The continuity of 1{I(x) 
</p>

<p>problem. Scattering of particles by square wells will be treated in Part V of these 
</p>
<p>lectures. For the moment, we content ourselves with noting that all energies for 
</p>
<p>E &gt; Vo are possible. In this energy regime, we therefore have a continuum of 
</p>
<p>allowed energies. 
</p>
<p>As a final remark, we note the solutions of the simple square well above can 
</p>
<p>also be used to solve a slightly different square well problem with

Vex) = Va for x &gt; a; (20) 
</p>
<p>i.e., the left potential has been replaced by a very high (00) potential step. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>l/J(x) = 0 for x &lt; O. This can therefore also be used for a 3-D spherically 
</p>
<p>symmetric square well leading to a I-D Schr6dinger equation of the above type, 
</p>
<p>where x is replaced by the radial coordinate, r. (Note, the region r &lt; 0 is excluded 
</p>
<p>by the fictitious infinite potential for r &lt; 0.) Because the boundary condition at 
</p>
<p>r = 0 is l/J(r = 0) = 0, only the odd solutions of the above potential will be 
allowed (see thc dashed curves of Fig. 4.2). We see a bound state exists for this 
</p>
<p>problem, only if 
</p>
<p>rr 
</p>
<p>zo&gt; 2' or (21) 
</p>
<p>If the sinusoidal radial wave function starting with the value 0 at r = 0 does not 
have enough curvature in the potential well region to have at least a first maximum 
</p>
<p>for r &lt; a, it will reach the barrier at r = a with a positive slope that cannot fit onto 
</p>
<p>a negative (decaying) exponential in the region r &gt; a without a discontinuity in 
</p>
<p>slope and, hence, a discontinuity in the probability density current. If the potential 
</p>
<p>well is not deep enough or wide enough, no bound state will exist. The potential 
</p>
<p>of eq. (20) is a reasonably good approximation for the effective potential between 
</p>
<p>neutron and proton in the deuteron. [Note that the mass in eq. (21) must be replaced 
</p>
<p>by the reduced mass of this 2-body problem.] The deuteron has only a single bound 
</p>
<p>state in its 2-particle spin triplet (S = I) state. Moreover, the binding energy of 
this state, of 2.22 MeV (with E = Va - 2.22 MeV) is small compared with the 
</p>
<p>expected value of Va. The deuteron is therefore a barely bound system with 
</p>
<p>The deuteron has no bound states with 2-particle spin S = O. The potential must 
</p>
<p>therefore be spin dependent. The S = 0 potential just misses having a bound state. 
This property makes itself felt in a large scattering cross section for E - Va ~ 0, a 
</p>
<p>low-energy resonance. For a detailed discussion of proton-neutron scattering and 
</p>
<p>the bound or nearly bound states of the deuteron, see Chapter 44. </p>

</p>
<p>The true hindering potential is probably somewhere between these two extremes. 
</p>
<p>The square well approximation leads to the easiest solution; yet it contains the 
</p>
<p>essential physics of the problem. A symmetrical X 2Y6 molecule such as C2H6 
</p>
<p>(ethane) leads to a similar SchrOdinger equation with 3-fold periodicity, i.e., with 
</p>
<p>N = 3. The symmetrical CH3N02 molecule furnishes an example with N = 6-
fold periodicity. Here, the C-N bond furnishes the symmetry axis for both the 
</p>
<p>CH3 and N02 units of the molecule. In these examples, the (N + 1 )st site of the 
potential is truly the same point in 3-D space as the first site. In the condensed 
</p>
<p>matter problem with N lattice sites, one usually takes periodic boundary conditions 
</p>
<p>by assuming the (N + l)st site is equivalent to the first site, in the limit N -+ 00. 
In the square well approximation for the periodic potential, we assume 
</p>
<p>v = 0 for (2m - l)a + mw &lt; x &lt; (2m + l)a + mw; 
V=+Vo for (2m+l)a+mw&lt;x&laquo;2m+l)a+(m+l)w; 
</p>
<p>m=O,l, ... ,N. (23) 
</p>
<p>We see the mth potential valley is centered atx = 2ma +mw, and the mth potential 
</p>
<p>barrier is centered at x = (2m + l)a + (m + 4 w); see Fig. 4.4. For the moment, we 
shall seek only solutions for E &lt; Vo. (For the hindered internal rotation problems, 
</p>
<p>we can expect the barrier heights, Vo, to be very large compared with the energies 
</p>
<p>of interest.) For this case, we define </p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>C The Periodic Square Well Potential 51 
</p>
<p>where J1, is an effective mass for the problem. We expect the following solutions. 
</p>
<p>In the mth valley centered at x = 2ma + mw: 
</p>
<p>1fr(x) = Cm cosk[x - m(2a + w)] + Dm sink[x - m(2a + w)]; 
</p>
<p>under the mth potential hilI. centered at x = (2m + l)a + (m + 1w): 
</p>
<p>l/I(x) = Am COShK(X - [(2m + l)a + (m + 1W:I1) 
</p>
<p>+Bm sinhK(x - [(2m + l)a + (m + 1)w]). 
</p>
<p>The potential is invariant under reflections in the planes centered at x = 2ma + m w 
and atx = (2m + l)a +(m + 1 w). We might thus be tempted to assume our solutions 
are either even or odd under these reflection operations and that either Am = 0 
</p>
<p>or Bm = O. and, similarly. either Cm = 0 or Dm = o. These assumptions would 
be good if all allowed energies were nondegenerate. We shall find, however, most 
</p>
<p>of the allowed energy values are doubly degenerate, with two allowed solutions. 
</p>
<p>We therefore retain the above linear combinations of even and odd functions. To 
</p>
<p>ensure the continuity of the probability density and the probability density currents 
</p>
<p>at the discontinuities of the potential, we shall again require the continuity of the 
</p>
<p>wave functions and their first derivatives at the boundaries between the potential 
</p>
<p>hills and Valleys. With the solution under the (m - l)st potential hill given by 
</p>
<p>l/I(x) = A m - 1 coshK(x - [(2m - l)a + (m -1)W]) 
</p>
<p>+Bm- 1 SinhK(X - [(2m - l)a + (m -1)W]), 
</p>
<p>the continuity of l/I and its first derivative at the left boundary of the mth valley, 
i.e., atx = (2m - l)a +mw, leads to 
</p>
<p>Am-l coshK-I + Bm- 1 sinhK-I = Cm coska - Dm sinka; (24) 
</p>
<p>K(Am-l sinhK-I + Bm- 1 coshK-I) = k(Cm sinka + Dm coska). (25) 
</p>
<p>The continuity of l/I and its first derivative at the right boundary of the mth valley, 
at x = (2m + l)a + mw, leads to 
</p>
<p>Cm cos ka + Dm sin ka = Am cosh K -I - Bm sinh K 1'-, (26) 
</p>
<p>k(-Cm sinka + Dm coska) = K(-Am sinhK-I + Bm coshK1'-). (27) 
</p>
<p>Solving eqs. (24) and (25) for Cm and Dm and substituting into eqs. (26) and (27)

<p>For very large N in a crystalline lattice, therefore, we have a set of (N + 1)

energies are separated by energy gaps of order (E~~l - E~O)). As E~O) approaches 
Va, the bandwidths become larger and the gaps smaller. Of course, as E~O) -+ Vo, 
</p>
<p>our high Vo approximations are no longer valid. The bandwidth and gap structure, 
</p>
<p>however, survives even into the region E &gt; Vo. (For details, see, e.g., C. Kittel, 
</p>
<p>Introduction to Solid State Physics, New York: John Wiley, 1956.) In a real solid, 
</p>
<p>we must of course also deal with a 3-D structure. It is therefore perhaps interesting 
</p>
<p>to note that in a cooler ring of some modem generation heavy ion accelerators 
</p>
<p>we may approximate a truly 1-D crystal of cold (hence, nearly monoenergetic) 
</p>
<p>heavy ions. In the limit of temperature, T -+ 0, these form a I-D crystal of equally 
</p>
<p>spaced monoenergetic heavy ions. Here, indeed, the (N + lyt ion is the pt ion, 
and the periodic boundary condition of eq. (31) is no longer an approximation. 
</p>
<p>Although the square well solution has all of the qualitative features found with a 
</p>
<p>more realistic potential, an approximate solution for a more realistic V (x) can be 
</p>
<p>found through the WKB approximation to be treated in Chapters 36 and 37 (see, 
</p>
<p>in particular, problem 55).

</p>
<p>For a V (x) that is such that V -+ 00 for both large positive and large negative

<p>58 4. Schrodinger Theory: The Existence of Discrete Energy Levels 
</p>
<p>regions II, conversely, for x &gt; xmax.class., or for x &lt; Xmin.class., the Schr6dinge.r 
</p>
<p>equation has the form 
</p>
<p>(46) 
</p>
<p>because E &lt; Vex). In regions n, therefore, the curvature is always away from 
the axis. To find a solution, start with some assumed initial value for 1jr(xo) and 
</p>
<p>~~ Ixo. The equation then gives us the value of 1jr(x) and ~~ at the neighboring 
points. We could numerically determine the solution, say, from some Xo in the 
</p>
<p>classically allowed region to the right boundary, where the solution changes from 
</p>
<p>one with curvature toward the axis to one with curvature away from the axis. For 
</p>
<p>the solution, labeled 1, in Fig. 4.5, e.g., the curvature away from the axis will 
</p>
<p>be such that 1jr(x) never reaches negative values. The function and its derivative 
</p>
<p>will thus both get larger and larger as x reaches further away from the classically 
</p>
<p>allowed values of x; and both 1jr(x) and ~~ will go to +00 as x ~ +00. This is 
a catastrophe. Such a function is surely not square-integrable. We can, however, 
</p>
<p>start the process over again. Starting with the same 1jr(xo) at xc, we can adjust the 
</p>
<p>first derivative at xc, as in the curve, labeled 2. Now, as we reach the right classical 
</p>
<p>turning point, the curvature away from the axis can be made less; perhaps we have 
</p>
<p>chosen a derivative at Xo such that now the solution in the classically forbidden 
</p>
<p>region, Ha, reaches the value 0 and thereafter curves away from the axis becoming 
</p>
<p>more and more negative along with its first derivative, so now both 1jr -+ -00 
</p>
<p>and ~~ -+ -00 as x -+ +00. Again, we have a catastrophe. This solution cannot 
</p>
<p>be square-integrable. We can, however, continue to adjust the first derivative at Xo 
</p>
<p>until it is just right, so both 1jr(x) and ~~ ~ 0 together as we penetrate into the 
</p>
<p>classically forbidden region, x ~ +00, as shown in the solution, labeled 3 in Fig. 
</p>
<p>4.5. This solution will have only a small probability the particle will be found in 
</p>
<p>the classically forbidden region. This solution can now be continued from Xo to 
</p>
<p>more negative values of x, but because we have no further freedom of "fixing" 
</p>
<p>the first derivative at Xo, when the solution reaches the left turning point, it will 
</p>
<p>undoubtedly curve away from the axis such that either both 1jr(x) and :: ~ +00 or 
both -+ -00 as x ~ -00. Again, a catastrophe: a nonsquare-integrable solution. 
</p>
<p>For arbitrary values of E, therefore, we will not get an allowed (square-integrable) 
</p>
<p>solution. We can now, however, further adjust the energy E such that once we have 
</p>
<p>fixcd the proper behavior as x -+ +00 we will also have both 1jr(x) and ~~ ~ 0 
as x ~ -00. This unique situation can only occur for a discrete set of values of E, 
</p>
<p>the allowed values of E: Eo, E 1, E2, ... , En, .... This situation exists for a V (X), 
</p>
<p>which -&gt; +00 for both x _._). &plusmn;oo. 
</p>
<p>In Fig. 4.6, we show a potential function that for E &gt; V = V 00 has only a 
left classically forbidden region. For such a Vex), for E &gt; V, we can always fix 
the solution such that both 1jr(x) and ~~ together ~ 0 as x ~ -00. For such a 
</p>
<p>potential, all values of E &gt; V are allowed. As x ~ +00, the solution remains 
oscillatory. The 1jr(x) is not square integrable, but the solution has a sensible 
</p>
<p>probability interpretation. It now corresponds to a particle with finite kinetic energy 
</p>
<p>coming in from +00 being reflected near x = 0 and going back out to +00. This </p>

</p>
<p>is a scattering problem, associated with the continuum of allowed energies. The 
</p>
<p>wave function is now normalized to describe a definite flux (value of S). Because 
the solution 1/1 (x ) again has a sensible probability interpretation for values of x as 
x -+ +00 for all values of E &gt; V, all values of E &gt; V are allowed leading to a 
continuum of allowed energies. 
</p>
<p>Finally, in Fig. 4.7, another potential is shown, of the type perhaes describing 
</p>
<p>the motion of an a-particle relative to a heavy nucleus. For E &gt; V = Voo , we 
</p>
<p>again have an energy continuum; for values of V &lt; E &lt; Vbarrier and arbitrary 
values of E, however, we would expect a much greater probability the particle be 
</p>
<p>in region III, outside the barrier. Now, certain states will exist, with a narrow width 
</p>
<p>(narrow range l!,.E) about a discrete E for which the probability of finding the 
</p>
<p>particle in region I rather than in region III is overwhelmingly large. These states 
</p>
<p>are the virtually bound states. They are, however, part of the energy continuum 
</p>
<p>and have a finite (perhaps very small) probability the particle will tunnel through 
</p>
<p>the barrier and stream out to +00 (see problem 8). 
</p>
<p>E The Energy Eigenvalue Problem: General 
</p>
<p>For potentials with a discrete spectrum of allowed energy values (as in Fig. 4.5), 
</p>
<p>the SchrOdinger equation leads to the allowed solutions 
</p>
<p>H1/In(x) = E,,1/In(x), (47) 
</p>
<p>with allowed energy values, En, the so-called eigenvalues, or characteristic values 
</p>
<p>of E. 
</p>
<p>1. If the Hamiltonian operator is hermitian, H = H t , the En are real. 
</p>
<p>&lt; 1/In, H1/In &gt;= En &lt; 1/In, 1/In &gt;= En 
</p>
<p>=&lt; (H t 1/ln), 1/1" &gt;=&lt; (H1/In), 1/1" &gt;=&lt; 1/In, H1/In &gt;*= E;. (48) 
</p>
<p>2. The orthogonality of the eigenfunctions, 1/1", follows from 
</p>
<p>H1/In = En1/ln, (49) 
</p>
<p>and 
</p>
<p>(50) 
</p>
<p>By multiplying the first of these equations by 1/1;;', the second by 1/1 n , and subtracting, 
we get 
</p>
<p>(51) 
</p>
<p>The left-hand side of this equation is zero via the hermiticity of H, so 
</p>
<p>o. (52) 
</p>
<p>Thus, with En I- Em, &lt; 1/Im, 1/1" &gt;= O. The eigenfunctions are orthogonal 
to each other. </p>

<p>62 4. Schr6dinger Theory: The Existence of Discrete Energy Levels 
</p>
<p>F A Specific Example: The One-Dimensional 
</p>
<p>Harmonic Oscillator 
</p>
<p>The Schr6dinger equation is 
</p>
<p>li 2 d2 mui 
- - --1J!(q) + _0 q21J!(q) = E1J!(q). 
</p>
<p>2m dq2 2 
(53) 
</p>
<p>As a first step in the solution, it will be convenient to introduce a dimensionless 
</p>
<p>coordinate x; i.e., to define appropriately scaled coordinates. Thus, the physical 
</p>
<p>displacement, q, will be transformed into a dimensionless coordinate, x, where the 
</p>
<p>"yardstick" for q can be obtained from the value of the potential energy which must 
</p>
<p>be proportional to the basic energy scale of the problem, mw~q2 = const.(liwo), so 
a natural yardstick for q is .jilfiii&pound;v-;;-: 
</p>
<p>(54) 
</p>
<p>Similarly, 
</p>
<p>1 d 
(55) px == 
</p>
<p>i dx' 
</p>
<p>E =liWOE, (56) 
</p>
<p>and the wave equation becomes 
</p>
<p>1 d 2 1 7 
- 2. dx21J!(x) + 2x~1J!(x) = Eo/(X). (57) 
</p>
<p>The equation has a singular point only at x = &plusmn;oo. The first step is to find the 
asymptotic form of the solution at &plusmn;oo. The E1j;(X) term of eq. (57) is negligible 
</p>
<p>compared with the x 21J!(x) term as x -~ &plusmn;oo. Because

dr 
</p>
<p>1J! (x) ---+ e- t as x ---+ &plusmn;oo. (58) 
</p>
<p>(The second possible solution with a + exponential is ruled out by the boundary 
condition.) We transform the solution into 
</p>
<p>(59) 
</p>

<p>where 
</p>
<p>Lakk(k - l)xk- 2 = L(2k + I - 2E)akxk. (62) 
k=2 k=O 
</p>
<p>Changing the dummy summation index on the left-hand side from k ---+ (k + 2) 
and equating coefficients of the kth term leads to the two-term recursion relation 
</p>
<p>ak+2 2k + 1 - 2E 
= -:-::--~:---:-
</p>
<p>ak (k + 2)(k + 1) 
(63) 
</p>
<p>To examine the behavior of this infinite series at large values of x, look at the 
</p>
<p>asymptotic form as k ---+ 00. This form is 
</p>
<p>or

<p>(65)

<p>(66) 
</p>
<p>Thus, for general values of E, 1/I(x) ---+ 00, we do not have a square-integrable 
</p>
<p>solution. For the special value 
</p>
<p>2E = (2n + 1), (67) 
</p>
<p>the infinite series of eq. (61) can terminate at the nth term. If n is an even integer and 
</p>
<p>ao =1= 0, the recursion formula of eq. (63) yields an+2 = 0, and, therefore, am = 0 
with m = n + 2k. If n is an even integer, and if we had al =1= 0, however, all am with 
odd integers m would survive up to m ---+ 00, and the infinite series would again 
</p>
<p>diverge as e+x2 &bull; If n is an even integer, we must therefore have ill = O. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>if n is an odd integer, we must have ao = O. The series therefore terminates 
</p>
<p>with n = even, 
</p>
<p>with n = odd, 
</p>
<p>a, =0, 
ao = 0, 
</p>
<p>an+2 = 0, 
</p>
<p>an+2 = O. (68) 
</p>
<p>For these cases, the wave functions of eqs. (59) and (61) are square-integrable and 
</p>
<p>lead to the discrete set of allowed energy eigenvalues 
</p>
<p>2E = (2n + 1); (69)

<p>A The Bargmann Transform 
</p>
<p>For many calculations involving 1-0 harmonic oscillator wave functions, it is

</p>
<p>where 
</p>
<p>F(k) = [: dx1/J(x)A(k, x), 
</p>
<p>1/J(x) = ~f d 2ke-kk* A(k*, x)F(k),

</p>
<p>At times, the latter may lead to the easier integral.

<p>C A Second Useful Application: The matrix (x)nm

<p>in the nth eigenstate. Because in that case the integrand is an odd function of x, 
</p>
<p>this expectation value is zero. The particle is equally likely to be in the right half

<p>or the left half of the x domain. For general n, m, the two-index quantity defined

<p>as (x)nm in eg. (16) will be shown to be a matrix in Chapter 6. For general n, m,

<p>76 6. Further Interpretation of the Wave Function 
</p>
<p>A Application 1: Tunneling through a Barrier 
</p>
<p>As a simplest application, consider the NH3 molecule system, where the motion of 
</p>
<p>the N-atom relative to the H3 plane is governed by the double-minimum potential 
</p>
<p>of problem 7. The lowest-energy eigenfunction was an even function of x; the first 
</p>
<p>excited state, at an excitation energy, I:!..E, above the ground state (see Fig. 6.1), has 
</p>
<p>an eigenfunction that is an odd function of x, but otherwise almost identical with 
</p>
<p>the lowest-energy eigenfunction (see Fig. 6.2). Ifwe actually make a measurement 
</p>
<p>of the position of the N -atom when the x-vibrational motion is not excited, we will 
</p>
<p>find the N-atom either above the H3 plane, x &gt; 0, or below it, x &lt; O. Suppose at 
</p>
<p>t = 0 we make a measurement telling us the N-atom is above the H3 plane. Then, 
</p>
<p>I 
\{I (x, t = 0) = y'2 (1/I0.even + 1/IO.odd) = 1/IRight.

<p>(9) 
</p>
<p>In this time, therefore, the N-atom has tunneled from the right potential minimum 
</p>
<p>through the barrier to the left potential minimum. In twice this time, we will again 
</p>
<p>find the N-atom in the right minimum. The N-atom tunnels back and forth through 
</p>
<p>the potential barrier with a frequency given by 
</p>
<p>I:!..E 
Vtunneling = 2nli' (10) 
</p>
<p>From the solution of problem 7, I:!..E is proportional to the Gamow factor, e-G , 
</p>
<p>with G = 2aJ[2tL(Vo - E)jJi2] for the square well barrier of width 2a. For a 
</p>
<p>more general Vex), this would be replaced by 
</p>
<p>G = i:a dxJ[2tL(V(x) - E)jJi2], 
as will be shown in Chapter 37, where the Gamow factor, e-G , is the most crucial 
</p>
<p>part for the probability of tunneling through the barrier. 
</p>
<p>We end with a parenthetic remark: In the above discussion, we have used another 
</p>
<p>result of problem 7. The lowest-state eigenfunction for our symmetric potential, 
</p>
<p>with V (-x) = V (x), is an even function of x. This result seems to be universally </p>

</p>
<p>such matrix elements of dynamical quantities entirely withoutthe concept of a wave 
</p>
<p>equation or a wave function. 
</p>
<p>D Heisenberg Matrix Mechanics 
</p>
<p>We are therefore now at a stage where we can make a short historical remark about 
</p>
<p>the Heisenberg derivation of the laws of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg did not 
</p>
<p>think in terms of a wave equation or in terms of a wave function. He started by 
</p>
<p>thinking about the laws of classical dynamics for a periodic (or more generally 
</p>
<p>a multiple-periodic or quasiperiodic system) in terms of a Fourier analysis of the 
</p>
<p>classical generalized coordinates, q. For a simple periodic system, 
</p>
<p>q(t) = LqneillWI, with w = 2rrv, 
n 
</p>
<p>(19) 
</p>
<p>where qn is the Fourier amplitude for the n'h overtone of the classical fundamental 
</p>
<p>w. (For a multiple-periodic system, nw would be replaced by n\w\ + n2w2 + ... + 
n fW f, and the sum would be over f overtone indices, and the Fourier coefficients 
would depend on f integers, qn = qnln, ... nr) 
</p>
<p>Now, Heisenberg reasoned: Because the n'h overtone has to be replaced by a 
</p>
<p>two-index quantity, via the Bohr frequency relation, 
</p>
<p>En - Em 
nw Bohr, (20) 
</p>
<p>the Fourier coefficient qn should also be replaced by a two-index quantity 
</p>
<p>Heisenberg matrix. (21) 
</p>
<p>Moreover, these qnm are the only observable (physically meaningful) quantities. In 
</p>
<p>addition, because matrices do not commute, the quantum mechanically meaningful 
</p>
<p>p and q matrices do not commute. In particular, Heisenberg introduced the Planck 
</p>
<p>constant into his matrix algebra with the simple assumption 
</p>
<p>Ii 
L(Pnkqkm - qnkPkm) = -;8nm . 
</p>
<p>k l 
</p>
<p>(22) 
</p>
<p>In the limit, Ii --+ 0, P and q do commute as they should in the classical limit, 
</p>
<p>when Ii becomes too small to matter. The genius of the Heisenberg approach is 
</p>
<p>contained in this Heisenberg relation, which we have already met in Section 3G 
</p>
<p>in the framework of the Schrodinger approach. 
</p>
<p>Using the P, q matrix commutation relation, the relation between H(p, q) and 
</p>
<p>E, and the commutators [p, H(p, q)] and [q, H(p, q)], which followfromeq. (22), 
</p>
<p>Heisenberg found the allowed energy values and the matrix elements of p and q via 
</p>
<p>matrix algebra for the 1-0 harmonic oscillator and other simple dynamical systems, 
</p>
<p>without the use of a wave equation. The equivalence between the Heisenberg qnm 
</p>
<p>and the SchrOdinger &lt; 1/In, q1/lm &gt; was demonstrated by SchrOdinger in 1926.

<p>We shallieam how to solve such problems by purely algebraic techniques,without

<p>introducing wave functions and differential equations. For the moment, however, 
</p>
<p>let us go back to the coordinate representation, and, in particular, let us choose

<p>A = H, where H is the Hamiltonian for a single particle in three dimensions, or 
</p>
<p>for the two-particle problem after transformation to center of mass and relative 
</p>

</p>
<p>relative motion of the two-particle system is given by the SChrOdinger equation

<p>Now, we have a function of r only, on the left-hand side of the equation, equaling

<p>a function of e and &cent; only on the right. Hence, each function must be equal to 
the same constant, to be named, Ao. By multiplying the right-hand side by sin2 e, 
we can further separate the e and &cent;-dependent pieces. Letting the new separation

<p>The effective potential term often contains a parameter, named m in the generic

<p>equation, such as the parameter, m, in the e equation, or the parameter 1..0 in the r 
equation. 
</p>
<p>One of the methods used by Schr6dinger to solve this type of problem is the 
</p>
<p>so-called factorization method, which naturally leads to a constructive process via 
</p>
<p>ladder operators. The introduction of such ladder operators will ease the transition 
</p>
<p>to the algebraic techniques, which we will use later to solve such eigenvalue prob-
</p>
<p>lems, beginning with Chapter 14, where we reexamine many of these problems in 
</p>
<p>a new light. 
</p>
<p>A The Factorization Method: Ladder Operators 
</p>
<p>[A good reference for this method is: L. Infeld and T. E. Hull, Reviews of Modem 
</p>
<p>Physics 23 (1951) 21. The table of factorizations at the end of the article gives a 
</p>
<p>listing of 31 wave equations for which solutions are known in analytic form.] 
</p>
<p>In the factorization method, an attempt is made to solve the eigenvalue problem 
</p>
<p>of eq. (15) by factoring the Schr6dinger operator containing a second derivative op-
</p>
<p>erator into a product of two factors, each containing only a first derivative operator. 
</p>
<p>Defining 
</p>
<p>d 
O+(m) = -- + k(x, m), 
</p>
<p>dx 
d 
</p>
<p>O_(m) = +- + k(x, m), 
dx 
</p>
<p>(16) 
</p>
<p>which through the basic second-order equation, eq. (15), satisfy the two equations 
</p>
<p>I: O+(m)O_(m)uAm(x) = [A - .c(m)]uAm(x), 
</p>
<p>II: O_(m + I)O+(m + l)u Am (x) = [Je - .c(m + l)]u Am (x). (17) 
</p>
<p>For the specific case of the e equation, our eq. (13), the function 
</p>
<p>1 
k(e, m) = (m - 2")cote 
</p>
<p>will do the trick. Our equation (I) becomes

</p>
<p>The proposed factorization works for the 8 equation and leads in this case to 
</p>
<p>(21) 
</p>
<p>We will postpone the question, treated in detail by Infeld and Hull, for which 
</p>
<p>"potentials" does the factorization work? Let us first prove a number of theorems. 
</p>
<p>Theorem I: 
</p>
<p>If uAm(x) is an eigenfunction of the generic equation with parameter, m, and 
</p>
<p>eigenvalue A, then [ 0_ (m)u Am (X) ] is an eigenfunction of the equation with param-
</p>
<p>eter, m - 1, and the same eigenvalue A, and [ 0+ (m + l)u Am (X)] is an eigenfunction 
</p>
<p>of the equation with parameter, m + 1, and the same eigenvalue A. 
</p>
<p>That is, 
</p>
<p>O_(m)UAm(X) = const.u).(m_l)(x), 
</p>
<p>O+(m + l)u Am (x) = const.uA(m+l)(x). (22) 
</p>
<p>To see the first, act on equation (I) from the left with 0._ (m) to give 
</p>
<p>o_(m)o+(m{ O_(m)UAm] = [A - c(m){ O_(m)uAnl l (23) 
that is, O-(m)uAm is a solution of equation (II), with m replaced by (m - 1). 
</p>
<p>Similarly, acting on equation (II) from the left with O+(m + 1) gives 
</p>
<p>o+(m+l)O_(m+l{ o+(m+l)UAm] = [A-C(m+l){ O+(m+l)uAm l (24) 
that is, O+(m + l)uAm is a solution of equation (I), now with m replaced by m + 1. 
</p>
<p>Thus, O_(m) and O+(m + 1) are m step-down, or step-up, operators that can 
</p>
<p>ladder from a known solution to other solutions. Still to be answered: Are the 
</p>
<p>new functions square-integrable if the original U Am were square-integrable? Do 
</p>
<p>the m-ladders continue indefinitely to smaller or larger values? These questions 
</p>
<p>still need to be answered. To see these, we need additional theorems. 
</p>
<p>Theorem II: 
</p>
<p>(25) 
</p>
<p>These relations follow from the adjoint properties of the two part8 of the operators 
</p>

k(x, m) = k(x, mY'. (26) </p>

<p>86 7. The Eigenvalue Problem 
</p>
<p>We can use this theorem to investigate the square-integrability of UJ.(mll)' 
</p>
<p>Assuming U,m is square-integrable, over an interval from a to b, consider 
</p>
<p>Jh . dxu~m+ 1 (X)U!.mll (x)

<p>" 
= IconSLl 2p. - &pound;(m + 1)] rb dxu~m(x)u!.m(x). (27) 
</p>
<p>Ja 
</p>
<p>If the number [A. - &pound;(m + I)] is a positive number, the final result is a patently 
positive quantity, and UAm+1 is square-integrable and can be normalized to one by 
</p>
<p>an appropriate choice of the constant. If &pound;(m) is an increasing function of m (see 
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.]), however, an m-value will come such that &pound;(m + 1) will be greater than A.. 
Eq. (27) then would say that a patently positive quantity on the left-hand side ofthe 
</p>
<p>equation would have to be a patently negative quantity on the right-hand side. This 
</p>
<p>cannot be. Hence, the assumption that the solution U).m was square-integrable must 
</p>
<p>have been wrong. The only way out of the soup comes if the m step-up process 
</p>
<p>quits; Le., if a maximum possible value of m exists, mmax, such that 
</p>
<p>(28) 
</p>
<p>which would require 
</p>
<p>A. = &pound;(mmax + 1). (29) 
</p>
<p>Eq. (28) is a first-order equation, which can in principle always be integrated

</p>
<p>value of m would (in general) come such that [A. - .cem - 1)] would be a negative 
</p>
<p>quantity, and again we would have a patently positive quantity on the left-hand 
</p>
<p>side of the equation equal to a patently negative quantity on the right. The initial 
</p>
<p>assumption that UJ,.m be square-integrable must have been wrong. In the special 
</p>
<p>case when A. = .c(mmin), however, the laddering process quits at the value mmin,

<p>and now no inconsistency exist.

<p>In this case, if .c(m) is a monotonic, decreasing function of m, (see Fig. 7.2), the

So far, we have considered cases with .c(m) being monotonic increasing or

</p>
<p>.c(m) = (m - ~)2, see fig. 7.3, is an increasing function of m for positive m values 
</p>
<p>and a decreasing function of m for negative m values. In this case, the laddering

<p>In the special case of the (;l-equation, we have both

</p>
<p>and thus (44) 
</p>
<p>This quadratic equation for mmin has the two roots, mmin = -mmax and mmin = 
+(mmax + 1). Clearly, the last equation violates the meaning of mmin' Thus, with 
</p>
<p>mmax == t, the allowedm values range from +t in steps of one down to -t. Because 
(mmax - mmin) = 21 must be an integer, we have the result, 21 must be an integer. 
</p>
<p>Thus, seemingly I can be either an integer or a ~-integer. Later, we shall prove 
</p>
<p>only the integer values are allowed for the orbital or (;l equation. 
</p>
<p>Finally, the function C(m) could be a decreasing function of m for large positive 
</p>
<p>values of m and an increasing function of m for negative values of m (see Fig. 
</p>
<p>7.4). In this case for a A &lt; Cmax , now two ranges of m values exist, one beginning 
</p>
<p>at an mmin and going in integer steps on to +00, and a second beginning at an

<p>where rows and columns are labeled in the conventional order, m = + I, 0, -1. 
Because the spherical harmonics form a complete orthonormal set, we can 
</p>
<p>translate the operators L&plusmn; into the following functional forms. For example, 
</p>
<p>00 m=+l 
</p>
<p>L+ = L L YJ(m+l)(O, cJ&raquo;Yt':n(O, cJ&raquo;(J(l- m)(1 + m + 1)). (22)

</p>
<p>In our method of constructing the (21 + 1) spherical harmonics for a particular 
I, we have started with the eigenfunction with m = mmax = 1, and we have then 
</p>
<p>used the normalized step-down operators, eL(m), to calculate the remaining 21 
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions. Alternatively, we could have started with m = mmin and laddered 
with ('J+(m + 1). A third possibility would be to start with the spherical harmon-
ics with m = 0 and use successive application of L&plusmn; to calculate the spherical 
</p>
<p>harmonics with &plusmn;m. 
</p>
<p>and

<p>i-Step operators for the () Equation 
</p>
<p>In the last section, we calculated the matrix elements of the operators, Lx, L y , L z. 
</p>
<p>These operators are functions only of e, cp, and fe, aa",. It will also be extremely 
useful to have the matrix elements of the angular parts of the position vector of 
</p>
<p>the particle, viz. :&pound; = sin e cos cp, I = sin e sin cp, and ~ = cos e. To get these, 
r r r 
</p>
<p>it would be useful to interchange the role of the quantum numbers I, and m, in 
</p>
<p>the factorization method and derive expressions for ladder operators changing I to 
</p>
<p>I &plusmn; I, keeping m fixed. 
For this purpose, rewrite the I-D e equation in the form 
</p>
<p>d 2e de 
- sin2 e-- - sinecose- -/(1 + 1) sin2 ee = -m2e. (1) 
</p>

</p>
<p>If we can find a change of variable transforming the derivative operators into I-D 
</p>
<p>form, we will have succeeded, because -m2 can then play the role of the fixed A, 
</p>
<p>whereas the parameter I is in a position to be stepped. The transformation achieving 
</p>
<p>the desired result is

<p>The Radial Functions for the

<p>Because we have solved the angular part of the one-body problem for a spherically

<p>symmetric VCr) (or, equivalently, the angular part for the relative motion of a two-
</p>
<p>body problem), it would be good to provide a detailed example for a particular

<p>potential, VCr). Because the Coulomb problem is soluble via the factorization

<p>Shape-Invariant Potentials: Soluble

</p>
<p>Eqs. (1) and (4) are the two conditions, I and II, of eq. (17) of Chapter 7, which

<p>must be satisfied for the factorization method to work. Now, shifting the index m

<p>to (m - 1) in eq. (4) 
</p>
<p>[O_(m)O+(m) + .c(m)]UA(m-l) = AUA(m-l)

</p>
<p>Infeld and Hull studied the question: What kind of k(x, m) can satisfy this equation? 
</p>
<p>Trying first a Taylor series in m 
</p>
<p>k(x, m) = ko(x) + k](x)m + ... , (11) 
</p>
<p>they found the potential collapses to a constant independent of x (hence, a trivial 
</p>
<p>unimportant case), if terms quadratic in m or higher powers of m are included. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the possible functions koex) and kJ (x) lead to a number of interesting 
</p>
<p>equations. Similarly, trying Laurent series in m

k(x, m) = ... + -- + ko(x) +k](x)m + ... , 
</p>
<p>m 
(12) 
</p>
<p>they again found inverse quadratic and higher inverse powers of m lead to potentials 
</p>
<p>independent of x and, hence, trivial. With the inverse first power in m, however, 
</p>
<p>they found a number of new interesting cases. 
</p>
<p>It would of course be much nicer if we could immediately answer the question: 
</p>
<p>Given a potential, V (x, m), can we find solutions for the Schrodinger equation by 
</p>
<p>the factorization method, or, what is equivalent: Can we find expressions for its 
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions and eigenvalues in simple analytic form? Because this question has 
</p>
<p>no simple general answer, we shall be content to follow the backward approach of 
</p>
<p>Infeld and Hull, and starting with a set of possible k(x, m) discover quite a number 
</p>
<p>of soluble problems. Recall again that the factorization method involves nothing 
</p>
<p>more mathematically challenging than the integration of a first-order differential 
</p>
<p>equation and the taking of first derivatives in the laddering process. </p>

<p>110 11. Shape-Invariant Potentials: Soluble I-D Potential Problems 
</p>
<p>A Shape-Invariant Potentials 
</p>
<p>If the potentials V(x, m) and vex, m - 1) are related as of eq. (9), the following 
is true. 
</p>
<p>1. The factorization method works. 
</p>
<p>2. The spectrum of allowed eigenvalues, A, for the potential vex, m - 1) is the 
same as that for V (x, m), except the eigenvalue, A = C(mmin), does not exist in the 
</p>
<p>spectrum for Vex, m - 1), because u).mmon- 1 does not exist, assuming for now we 
are dealing with a case for which C(m) is a decreasing function of m. This follows 
</p>
<p>because the eigenvalue A does not change when we shift m to m - 1 in equation 
</p>
<p>(II). 
</p>
<p>3. The potentials Vex, m) and vex, m - 1) are said to have the same shape, 
because the dependence on x is the same, and only the value of m is replaced by 
</p>
<p>m - 1 ("Shape invariance" of the potential). 
</p>
<p>Now, had we written equation (I) of the factorized form with m replaced by 
</p>
<p>m - 1, and then shifted m - 1 to m - 2 in equation (II), we see the equation for 
</p>
<p>Vex, m - 2) has the same spectrum as that for vex, m - 1), except the eigenvalue 
A = C(mmin - 1) is now missing. Thus, we can have a whole set of potentials 
</p>
<p>with the same shape, all with the same spectrum, except the lowest eigenvalue of 
</p>
<p>VeX, m) is missing in vex, m - 1), the lowest eigenvalue of vex, m - I), and 
hence the two lowest eigenvalues of vex, m) are missing for vex, m - 2), and so 
on. Thus, the spectrum for vex, m - n) is the same as that for vex, m), except 
the lowest n eigenvalues of V (x, m) are missing in the spectrum for V (x , m - n), 
</p>
<p>provided the factorization is such that the eigenvalues are given by A = C(mmin), 
that is, cases for which C(m) is a decreasing function of m. Similar arguments can 
</p>
<p>be made for the other case, i.e., if C(m) is an increasing function of m. In that case, 
</p>
<p>setting m --+ m + 1 in eqs. (3) and (6), we see V(x, m + 1) has the same spectrum of 
A values, now with A = C(mmax. + 1), except A = C(mmax. + I), which exists in the 
spectrum for Vex, m) with eigenfunction u;".mmax' does not exist in the spectrum 
for Vex, m + 1), because u)..mm" +1 does not exist. Similarly, in the spectrum for 
Vex, m + n), the eigenvalues A = C(mmax. + 1), C(mmax. + 2), ... , C(mmax. + n) 
do not exist. The lowest eigenvalue for Vex, m + n) is A = C(mmax. + n + I), 
which is also the nth eigenvalue for Vex, m).

(We will subsequently investigate the region of m values near the positive root to

<p>In particular, if we had tried to continue the laddering process of eq. (27) one

<p>an n value will exist such that l(l + 1) = (lmax. - n)(Imax. - n+ 1) becomes a

<p>even for this case, the value of the integer, fI, can go to arbitrarily high values, and 
</p>
<p>an infinite number of bound states exist. The values for (/0 + fI) are positive for

Because a second branch of allowed &pound;(1) values for negative values of I exists, with

<p>D gives the classical ionization or dissociation energy. The potential has a min-
</p>
<p>imum value, Vmin. = -D, at x = O. For E :::: 0, a continuous spectrum exists. 
The particle can proceed to x --+ +00. With the introduction of dimensionless 
</p>
<p>quantities, 
</p>
<p>x 
Z =-, 
</p>

this function leads to 
</p>
<p>d 2u 2 2- 1_

<p>where the parameter, m, with 
</p>
<p>(m+4)=_1 
</p>
<p>o ' 
(52) 
</p>
<p>has been introduced to put the equation into factorizable form, with

O&plusmn;(m) = =F- + (oe-&lt;' + m), and &pound;(m) = -m . 
</p>
<p>dz 
(53) 
</p>
<p>Note, -0 - 4 = -J(2JLa2 Dfli2) - 4, and hence, m, is a patently negative quantity. 
For m &lt; 0, the above &pound;(m) is an increasing function of m. For bound states, with 
</p>
<p>A &lt; 0, a maximum possible value of m = mmax. exists. The allowed m values are 
</p>
<p>m = mmax., (mmax. - 1), ... , (mmax. - n), ... , with 
</p>
<p>An = En = &pound;(mmax. + 1) = -em + n + 1)2 = -(-0 +n + ~)2

<p>The shape-invariant partner potentials are Vo(z, rno), VI (z, rno+ 1), ... , Vn(z, rno+

<p>Vn(z, rna + n) = &laquo;(82e-2Z + 28(-8 + n)e-z). (57) 
</p>
<p>This potential has the form shown in Fig. 11.2, with an attractive minimum, only 
</p>
<p>for n &lt; 8; and the number of vibrational states is therefore limited. A maximum 
</p>
<p>possible n value, nmax. exists. 
</p>
<p>The ground-state eigenfunction of Vn is given by

<p>O+(rno + n + l)u).,,(mo+n) = [- :z + (8e-z + (n - 8 + 1&raquo;) ]U).,,(mo+n) = 0, (58) 
(59) 
</p>
<p>Successive action with the normalized step-down operators, O_(rn), with rn = 
</p>
<p>(rno + n), (rno + n - 1), ... , (rna + 1) yields the needed nth excited-state eigen-
function of Vo. These u).".m are normalized in the interval -00 ::::: z ::::: +00. 
Also, the u).",m are normalizable only for integers n such that n &lt; (8 - 1), which 
determines, nmax .&bull; 
</p>
<p>In the actual applications, the Morse potential is used for the relative motion of 
</p>
<p>the two atoms in a diatomic molecule, i.e., for the radial function of this two-body 
</p>
<p>problem. In that case, therefore, /-L is the reduced mass of the diatomic molecule, 
</p>
<p>and x = (r - re ), where, re is the equilibrium value of the interatomic distance, 
</p>
<p>r. Thus, the eigenfunctions should apply to the interval, -(re/a) ::::: z ::::: +00. For 
realistic parameters for most diatomic molecules, however, the Morse potential 
</p>
<p>has such a large positive value at z = -(re/a) that the Morse eigenfunctions are 
effectively zero for z &lt; -(re/a). The I-D solutions found above for the full z-space </p>

<p>5. The one-dimensional harmonic oscillator revisited.

<p>The I-D harmonic oscillator Schr6dinger equation

<p>(-::2 +x2)u(x) = 2EU(X), (67) 
with dimensionless, x and 10, is factorizable, with 
</p>
<p>O&plusmn; = (=f :x +x). (68) 
</p>
<p>The only parameter, however, is the energy, 10, itself, and the factors, O&plusmn;, are not 
</p>
<p>functions of E. Now,

<p>I O+O_u;'m = [A - .e(rn)]u;.m, 
II O-O+u;.m = [A - .e(rn + I)]u;.m. (70) 
</p>
<p>Therefore, A has the single-fixed eigenvalue, A = -1, and the parameter, m, is 
</p>
<p>replaced by 10, with .e(E) = -210. Because .e(E) is a decreasing function of 15, an

<p>classically forbidden regions so both u).. and its first derivative will go to zero 
</p>
<p>together as x -+ &plusmn;oo, as required for a square-integrable function. Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>lowest allowed eigenfunction will have no zeros. For a I below the lowest allowed 
A, the curvature away from the x-axis in the classically forbidden regions will 
</p>
<p>be too great and the function uI(x) will approach 00 for both x -+ &plusmn;oo before 
</p>
<p>uI(x) can reach the value zero (see Fig. 12.1). Thus, for every eigenvalue A of 
</p>
<p>the potential VI (x), a square-integrable (calculable) eigenfunction of the potential 
</p>
<p>V2(X) exists. The potential V2(X), however, has an additional eigenvalue, I, below 
the lowest A. Two candidates exist for square-integrable eigenfunctions associated

<p>The Vector Space Interpretation of 
</p>
<p>Quantum-Mechanical Systems 
</p>
<p>A Different "Representations" of the State of a 
</p>
<p>Quantum-Mechanical System 
</p>
<p>So far, we have specified the state of a quantum-mechanical system by the wave 
</p>
<p>function, \V(r, t), i.e., by specifying the value of the scalar function, \V, for all 
</p>
<p>values of x, y, z, at a particular time, 1. \V could also be specified, however, at a 
</p>
<p>particular time by the infinite set of numbers, cn(t), in the expansion of \V(r, t) in 
</p>
<p>the compleete set of energy eigenfunctions of the system, 
</p>
<p>(1) 
</p>
<p>with 
</p>
<p>(2) 
</p>
<p>Alternatively, \V could just as well be specified by another set of numbers, a set of 
</p>
<p>Fourier coefficients of some other (complete) set of generalized Fourier functions. 
</p>
<p>For example, we might use the eigenfunctions of some other Hamiltonian, H, 
</p>
<p>not the Hamiltonian of our system, or possibly H could be some other Hermitian 
</p>
<p>operator, not a Hamiltonian. Let us assume, in particular, H has both a discrete 
</p>
<p>and a continuous spectrum, where the discrete spectrum is numbered by an index, 
</p>
<p>i = 1, 2, ... , n, perhaps a finite number or perhaps an infinite number, whereas 
</p>
<p>the continuous eigenvalue spectrum is parameterized by a continuous variable, 0:, 
</p>
<p>such that 
</p>
<p>HUj(r) = Ejuj(i) (3) </p>

<p>The eigenfunctions must of course also form a complete set, where the 
</p>
<p>completeness relation is now 
</p>
<p>~:=U7(r')ui(r) + f daw~(r')w",(r) = 8(r' - h 
I 
</p>
<p>Now, \{J can be expanded in terms of this complete set via 
</p>
<p>\{J(r, t) = ~ciui(r) + f dac(a)w",(r), 
I 
</p>
<p>where the Cj and c(a) are given by

</p>
<p>The Ci and c(a) are now implicitly time dependent. These Ci and c(a) now give us 
</p>
<p>still another alternative for the description of our quantum-mechanical system. 
</p>
<p>So far, we have used Fourier expansions in a set of orthonormal functions that 
</p>
<p>themselves were square-integrable functions; i.e., they were themselves part of 
</p>
<p>our Hilbert space. The basis functions in the Fourier expansions, however, need 
</p>
<p>not themselves be square-integrable. In fact, our original expansion in terms of 
</p>
<p>ordinary Fourier plane-wave functions was of this type. The plane-wave functions

<p>The Fourier expansion of III is the standard Fourier one, with expansion

with 
</p>
<p>&cent;(p, t) =&lt; uP' III &gt; . (15) 
</p>
<p>The &cent;(p, t) now give us another alternative way of specifying the state of our 
</p>
<p>quantum-mechanical system. 
</p>
<p>Finally, we could even use a basis of Dirac delta functions for the generalized 
</p>
<p>Fourier expansion of our III, where these can be written, in analogy with the up, 
</p>
<p>or the 1/fn, as 
</p>
<p>(16) 
</p>
<p>where these u's are simultaneously the eigenfunctions of the three operators x, Y,

</p>
<p>xUi'o(r) = x8(r - ro) = x08(r - ro), (17) 
</p>
<p>where we have used the delta function relation 
</p>
<p>f(x)8(x) = f(0)8(x). (18) 
</p>
<p>The orthogonality of the u's is now given by the delta function relation 
</p>
<p>I dru;o(r)ur~(r) = I dr8(r - ro)8(r - r~) = 8(ro - r~). (19) 
The completeness relation is now given by the integral 
</p>
<p>I droupo(r')uro(r) = I dr08(ro - r')8(ro - r) = 8(r' - r). (20) 
The Fourier expansion of a 1/f (let us make it time independent for simplicity), in

<p>(21)

<p>1/f(ro). Hence, this description of the state of our system is just the wave function 
</p>
<p>description, where we specify 1/f at every point xo, Yo, Zo in space time. 
To summarize, we have given a number of alternative ways to give a complete 
</p>
<p>description of the state of our system: 
</p>
<p>1) through specification of \11 at every point in space time; 
</p>
<p>2) through the coefficients Cn through an expansion of III in terms of the 
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of our system; 
</p>
<p>3) through the coefficients, Ci and c(a), through an expansion of \11 in terms of the 
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of an hermitian operator H with both a discrete and a continuous 
</p>

<p>4) through the &cent;(p, t) in a standard Fourier expansion of plane waves. 
</p>
<p>There are thus many "representations" of our quantum-mechanical system. This 
</p>
<p>will lead us to an introduction to the Dirac notation in the next section. 
</p>
<p>B The Dirac Notation 
</p>
<p>Many different "representations" exist that can specify the state of an atomic 
</p>
<p>quantum-mechanical system, described by the wave function, \)J(r, t). We can 
</p>
<p>specify \)J at every point in space time; we can specify it through the Cn , or through 
</p>
<p>another set Ci and c(a), or through the &cent;(p, t), and so on. 
</p>
<p>Because our \[1(r, t) belong to the space of square-integrable functions, a quan-
</p>
<p>tum system specified by a \[1 can be thought of as a vector in infinite-dimensional 
</p>
<p>vector space. The coefficients, Cn , can be thought of as the components of this 
</p>
<p>vector along a particular set of coordinate axes, similarly, for the Ci and c(a) for 
</p>
<p>a different set of coordinate axes. In the same way, the &cent;(p, t) can be thought 
</p>
<p>of as the components of the state vector along the set of axes specified by the 
</p>
<p>momentum values, and the \[1(;, t) as the components of the state vector along a 
</p>
<p>set of axes specified by the values of the coordinates. The vector space of our \[1 
</p>
<p>with a well-defined complex scalar product is also called a Hilbert space. Just as 
</p>
<p>in ordinary finite-dimensional vector analysis, it will be convenient to specify a 
</p>
<p>vector by a generic symbol, not always by its coordinates along particular axes. 
</p>
<p>Dirac proposed to do this through his "kef' symbol. Thus, a state vector is specified 
</p>
<p>by 1\(1). Because scalar products &lt; &lt;P, \[1 &gt; are complex numbers, linear in \[1 but 
</p>
<p>antilinear in &lt;1&gt;, with 
</p>
<p>&lt; &lt;P, P .. I \[1, + A2\[(2) &gt;= Al &lt; &lt;1&gt;, \[11 &gt; +A2 &lt; &lt;P, \)J2 &gt;, 
&lt; (AI &lt;PI + A2&lt;1&gt;2), \[1 &gt;= Ar &lt; &lt;PI, \[1 &gt; +A2 &lt; &lt;P2, \[1 &gt;, 
</p>
<p>but 
</p>
<p>(22) 
</p>
<p>where AI and A2 are complex numbers, Dirac defines for every "ket" vector, IIII}, 
</p>
<p>a dual vector, the so-called "bra," denoted by (\[1 I, where 
</p>
<p>IAI \)JI + A2\)J2) = Al 1\[(1) + A21\[(2), 
{AI \[11 + A211121 = A7(\)JII + A; (\[12 I. (23) 
</p>
<p>The "bra" vector then pemlits us to write the scalar product of two vectors in terms 
</p>
<p>of a "bracket" 
</p>
<p>(&lt;I&gt;, \(1) == (&lt;PI\)J), (24) 
</p>
<p>In the new language, the Hilbert space is an infinite-dimensional vector space of 
</p>
<p>all vectors 1\(1) with a finite norm, 
</p>
<p>(\[1 1\(1) = finite real positive number. </p>

<p>142 13. The Vector Space Interpretation of Quantum-Mechanical Systems 
</p>
<p>Because we are dealing with an infinite-dimensional vector space, we will also 
</p>
<p>insist on the absolute convergence of expansions, such as

<p>\liN = :~'::&gt;/1/l1 as N -+ 00.

<p>(25) 
</p>
<p>(&lt;1&gt;1\11) is a number, usually a complex number. 
</p>
<p>In this new language, an operator can be written as, e.g.,

</p>
<p>because 
</p>
<p>I &lt;1&raquo; (A 1\11) = (a complex number) I &lt;1&raquo;; (27) 
</p>

<p>The Angular Momentum Eigenvalue 
</p>
<p>Problem (Revisited) 
</p>
<p>A Simultaneous Eigenvectors of Commuting Hermitian 
</p>
<p>Operators 
</p>
<p>So far, we have solved the angular momentum eigenvalue problem very specifically 
</p>
<p>in the coordinate representation for the case of the orbital angular momentum 
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions, the well-known spherical harmonics. Let us look at this problem 
</p>
<p>once more from a much more general point of view, which can be taken over for any 
</p>
<p>angular momentum problem, or even more generally for any problem involving 
</p>
<p>three hermitian operators with the same commutation relations as the Lx, Ly. and 
</p>
<p>L z&bull; We want to solve the problem of finding the simultaneous eigenvalues and 
</p>
<p>eigenvectors of the two (commuting) operators L . L. and L z&bull; We will now write 
the eigenequations in the new language 
</p>
<p>(L . L)/Am) = A/Am} 
</p>
<p>Lz/Am} = m/Am}, (1) 
</p>
<p>where we' have purposely used the Dirac notation for the eigenvectors. so no 
</p>
<p>implication is made as to a choice of representation. 
</p>
<p>The problem of finding the simultaneous eigenvectors of a pair (or more gener-
</p>
<p>ally a number) of commuting hermitian operators is a very general one, because 
</p>
<p>the complete specification of a base vector for an n-degree of freedom problem 
</p>
<p>will in general involve n quantum numbers, associated with the eigenvalues of n 
</p>
<p>commuting, hermitian operators. Let us first look at the case with n = 2. Let us 
</p>
<p>first prove a theorem as follows. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>146 14. The Angular Momentum Eigenvalue Problem (Revisited) 
</p>
<p>Theorem: Two hermitian operators A and B have the same set of eigenvectors 
</p>
<p>if and only if they commute. 
</p>
<p>First, assume the set of vectors la) are eigenvectors of both A and B: 
</p>
<p>Ala) = aala), 
</p>
<p>Bla) = bala). (2) 
</p>
<p>Now, let [A, B] = (AB - BA) act on an arbitrary state vector 11/r) of our vector 
</p>
<p>space. We shall assume the states la) form a complete set, and also note that a 
</p>
<p>particular la) may require more than one label for a complete specification, so a 
</p>
<p>may be a shorthand for two labels. Then, with 
</p>
<p>(3) 
</p>
<p>a 
</p>
<p>in the subspace in which A, and B act, we can project an arbitrary state vector 11/r) 
</p>
<p>onto the la) basis to get 
</p>
<p>(AB - BA)I1/r) = })AB - BA)la)(al1/r) = I)aaba - buaa)la) (al1/r) = 0, 
a a 
</p>
<p>(4) 
</p>
<p>because the au and ba are ordinary real numbers. 
</p>
<p>Conversely, if the la) are eigenvectors of the operator A, and if [A, B] = 0, 
</p>
<p>(AB - BA)I1/r) = &deg; 
= (AB - BA) })a)(al1/r) 
</p>
<p>a 
</p>
<p>= L(A - au)Bla)(al1/r) 
a 
</p>
<p>= L(A - aa)la')(a'IBla)(al1/r) 
a,a' 
</p>
<p>= })aa' - aa)(a'IBla)(al1/r). (5) 
a,a' 
</p>
<p>Because 11/r) is an arbitrary vector and the la) are assumed to form a basis for the 
</p>
<p>subspace of our vector space, we must have, for each pair of basis states la), la'), 
</p>
<p>(6) 
</p>
<p>Hence, 
</p>
<p>(a'IBla) = 0, if (7) 
</p>
<p>If the eigenvalues aa have no degeneracies, i.e., if but a single eigenvector as-
</p>
<p>sociated with each aa exists, the matrix of B is diagonal in the la) basis, and 
</p>
<p>(a'IBla) = Ou a,ba. The more common situation, however, is one in which de-
</p>
<p>generacies ass~ciated with the eigenvalues of A exist. For example, if A = P, 
(21 + 1) eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue of A exist. Then, with 
</p>
<p>A la(;) = aa la(i), with i = 1, 2, ... gao' (8)

<p>B The Angular Momentum Algebra 147 
</p>
<p>In this case, his still possible to take a linear combination ofthe la(i)), with the same 
</p>
<p>eigenvalue, aCt of the operator A, to make the matrix of the operator B diagonal in 
</p>
<p>this gaa - dimensional subspace. To specify the basis completely., we then need the 
</p>
<p>simultaneous eigenvalues of both operators A and B. 
</p>
<p>B The Angular Momentum Algebra 
</p>
<p>With this introduction, let us look at the eigenvalue problem of eq. (1) for the 
</p>
<p>operators L z , and l2, built from the three (dimensionless) operators, Lx, L y , L z, 
</p>
<p>where these satisfy the commutation relations 
</p>
<p>Our results will depend only on these commutation relations. Hence, other oper-
</p>
<p>ators with these same commutation relations will also be interesting. The other 
</p>
<p>angular momentum example involves the three components of the spin operator, 
</p>
<p>Sx, Sy, Sz. In the case of the orbital angular momentum operator, we were able 
</p>
<p>to write the operators in terms of functions of (), rp, a8e, and a~' i.e., in terms of 
explicit functions of the orbital coordinates. In the case of the electron, and other 
</p>
<p>fundamental particles, we know nothing about the intrinsic or internal coordinates 
</p>
<p>of such particles. In 1924, G. E. Uhlenbeck and S. Goudsmit had a picture in their 
</p>
<p>mind of an electron that was like a little rotating sphere, but to the best of our 
</p>
<p>ability to measure anything today to many significant figures, the electron is still 
</p>
<p>a point particle (with no observable internal structure). Hence, we cannot relate 
</p>
<p>the spin operators to internal "angles." In the case of a rotating molecule, we can 
</p>
<p>write the rotational, internal angular momentum in terms of three Euler angles and 
</p>
<p>their partial derivatives (as we shall see). Even though we know nothing about the 
</p>
<p>internal structure of an electron, however, it will be reasonable to assume the three 
</p>
<p>components of S obey the same commutation relations as the three components 
of l: 
</p>
<p>(11) 
</p>
<p>In addition, because the spin-degree of freedom will involve only internal or intrin-
</p>
<p>sic degrees of freedom of the electron, it will be natural to assume all components 
</p>
<p>of S commute with all components of l. With this additional relation, the three 
components of j, the total angular momentum, with 
</p>
<p>(12) 
</p>
<p>will also have the basic commutation relations of angular momentum 
</p>
<p>(13) 
</p>
<p>Still other operators exist, which may not be at all the three components of an 
</p>
<p>angular momentum, but have the same commutation relations. For example, the </p>

</p>
<p>three operators

<p>Ml = ~[(P; +X2) - (p~ + i)], 
1 
</p>
<p>M2 = 2(PXPy +xy), 
</p>
<p>1 
M3 = 2 (xpy - YPx), (14) 
</p>
<p>where x and Px are dimensionless coordinate and momenta, with x and Y measured 
</p>
<p>in appropriate length units, such that [Pj, xkl = -iOjk. From these commutation 
relations, it follows that 
</p>
<p>(15) 
</p>
<p>Because we shall prove the eigenvalues of M3 (like those of Sz, or l z) can only be 
</p>
<p>either integers or 4 -integers, and because M3 = 4 L z , we now have the proof that 
the orbital angular momentum quantum number m must be an integer. (It cannot be 
</p>
<p>a 4-integer, as the corresponding m quantum number of an arbitrary "spin.") The 
</p>
<p>operators M j of eq. (14), which are single-particle operators, can be generalized 
</p>
<p>to operators for a many-body system by summing over N particle indices, e.g., 
</p>
<p>1 n=N( ) 
M3 = 2: L XnPy" - YnPx. . 
</p>
<p>n=l 
</p>
<p>(16) 
</p>
<p>Thus, the result can be generalized to the m quantum number of an N -body system. 
</p>
<p>C General Angular Momenta 
</p>
<p>Let us consider the generic operators lx, ly, l z&bull; Again, we define 
</p>
<p>1&plusmn; = (1x &plusmn; ily), 
</p>
<p>The commutation relations translate to 
</p>
<p>[10 , L] = -L, 
</p>
<p>It will be useful to rewrite J 2 in various ways 
</p>
<p>[h, L] = 210 . 
</p>
<p>J2 = ~(1x + i ly)(1x - i 1y) + ~(1x - ily)(1x + i 1y) + f; 
1 2 
</p>
<p>= 2(1+L + Lh) + 10 
</p>
<p>=Lh+1i+10 
</p>
<p>(17) 
</p>
<p>(18) 
</p>
<p>= l+L + 1i - 10 , (19) 
</p>
<p>where we have used [1+, L] = 210 to write the operator in two basic forms. Now, 
</p>
<p>let us assume I Am) is simultaneously an eigenvector of J2 and 10, with eigenvalues 
A and m, respectively, where these are (so far) arbitrary real numbers: 
</p>
<p>J2IAm) = AIAm), </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>C General Angular Momenta 149 
</p>
<p>JOIAm} = mIAm}. (20) 
</p>
<p>Acting on these two equations from the left with the operator h and using the 
</p>
<p>commutation relations, [h, j2] = 0 and [h, Jo] = -J+, we get 
</p>
<p>J2(hIAm}) = A (J+ lAm}). 
</p>
<p>Jo(J+IAm}) = (m + l)(hIAm}). (21) 
</p>
<p>Similarly, acting on both equations from the left with L, we get 
</p>
<p>j2(LIAm}) = A(LIAm}). 
</p>
<p>Jo(LIAm}) = (m -l)(LIAm}). (22) 
</p>
<p>Thus, if lAm} is an eigenvector of ]2 and Jo with eigenvalues A and m, two 
possibilities exist. Either (h lAm}) is an eigenvector of j2 and Jo, with eigenvalues 
</p>
<p>A and(m + 1), or J+IAm} = O. Similarly, either (LIAm}) is an eigenvector of j2 
and Jo, with eigenvalues A and (m - 1), or L lAm} = O. 
</p>
<p>Let us assume the first possibility for the operator J+. Using eq. (19), let us 
</p>
<p>evaluate the diagonal matrix element of L J + for the eigenstate I Am} 
</p>
<p>{AmILJ+IAm} = {Aml(J2 - Ji - Jo)IAm} = [A - m(m + 1)]{AmIAm} 
= L {AmILIA'm'}{A'm'IJ+IAm} 
</p>
<p>}..',m l 
</p>
<p>= L{A'm'IJ~IAm}*{A'm'IJ+IAm} = LI{l'm'IJ+IAm)J2 
~~ ~~ 
</p>
<p>= [A - m(m + 1)]. (23) 
</p>
<p>The state hlAm} can exist if A&gt; m(m + 1). In that case, we could act with J+ to 
make the new state with (m + 1) and calculate the diagonal matrix element in the 
state IA(m + I)}. Moreover, we could repeat this process to ladder our way up to 
a state with (m + n), but the same A, so 
</p>
<p>LI{A'm'IJ+IA(m + n))J2 = [A - (m + n)(m + n + 1)]. (24) 
)../.m' 
</p>
<p>An integer n will then be large enough that the negative quantity -(m+n )(m +n+ 1) 
</p>
<p>will overwhelm the positive A, and we will have a patently positive quantity on the 
</p>
<p>left-hand side of the equation equal to a negative quantity on the right. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>the assumption that (Am I Am) = 1 for the starting value of m must have been wrong. 
</p>
<p>If the starting value of m is such that the laddering process has an upper bound, 
</p>
<p>however, we must come to a maximum value of m, such that (m + n) = mmax, 
with

the same way at the result 
</p>
<p>(Amll+LIAm) = LI(A"m"ILIAm)1 2 = fA ~ m(m ~ 1)]. (27) 
</p>
<p>Now, we can repeat the step-down process and step-down m until it would become 
</p>
<p>such a large negative number, so the negative quantity ~m(m ~ 1) = -lmlClml + 1) 
would overwhelm the positive A. Thus, again the step-down ladder must quit at a

</p>
<p>Tn addition, because the operators h do not change the eigenvalue A, the sums over 
A' or A" in egs. (24) and (27) collapse to the single value A. Also, ifthe eigenvectors

<p>are such that the state IAmmax.) is nondegenerate, the state (LIAmmax ) will also

<p>be nondegenerate; similarly for states with even lower m values. Then, the sum

<p>Final Remark: With our choice of phase for eqs. (34) and (35), we have made

<p>the matrix elements of Iy pure imaginary, and the matrix elements for lx real.

<p>This is the standard angular momentum phase convention. All three components,

<p>Rigid Rotators: Molecular Rotational 
</p>
<p>Spectra 
</p>
<p>A The Diatomic Molecule Rigid Rotator 
</p>
<p>For a rotating molecule the angular momentum, associated with the rotation of 
</p>
<p>this "nearly rigid" body can be expressed in tenns of Euler angles and their partial 
</p>
<p>derivatives. Hence, this may be a good first example. Consider the simplest case: 
</p>
<p>a diatomic molecule, e.g., the HCI molecule with one hydrogen and one Chlorine 
</p>
<p>nucleus and 1 + 17 electrons. The full 20-body problem is extremely complicated, 
but at very low energies no excitations associated with the electron degrees of 
</p>
<p>freedom win come into play. The electron cloud binds the two atomic nuclei into 
</p>
<p>a nearly rigid structure. The position of the diatomic molecule in 3-D space can be 
</p>
<p>described by a radial coordinate, r, giving the distance between the Hand CI nuclei, 
</p>
<p>and two angles, e, and &cent;, giving the orientation in space of the molecule axis, or 
</p>
<p>H-Clline. The wave function can be written as 1/I(r, e, &cent;) = R(r)Ylm(e, &cent;). The 
</p>
<p>electron cloud gives rise to a potential, VCr), with a deep (nearly parabolic) well 
</p>
<p>with a minimum ar r = r e , where this is the equilibrium distance between the 
</p>
<p>two atomic nuclei. The radial problem is associated with the vibrational motion 
</p>
<p>of the molecule, a nearly hannonic oscillator motion to good first approximation. 
</p>
<p>The energy associated with this vibration, nwo, is approximately 30 times that 
</p>
<p>associated with the lower rotational excitations. Thus, at sufficiently low energies, 
</p>
<p>we can replace the radial coordinate with its constant equilibrium value, re , and 
</p>
<p>the Hamiltonian collapses to 
</p>
<p>(1) </p>

</p>
<p>B The Polyatomic Molecule Rigid Rotator 
</p>
<p>For a polyatomic molecule, such as H20, with an isosceles triangle equilibrium 
</p>
<p>structure, the rotational Hamiltonian is more complicated. We now need three Euler 
</p>
<p>angles to specify the orientation in space of the nearly rigid molecule: two angles, 
</p>
<p>o and &cent;, to give the direction of the triangle's symmetry axis, and a third angle, X, 
to describe the "spinning" of the two H atoms about this symmetry axis. Again, 
</p>
<p>assuming the energies to be considered are so low vibrational excitations can be 
</p>
<p>neglected, we can replace the coordinates of the atomic nuclei by their (constant) 
</p>
<p>equilibrium values and are led to the rigid rotator Hamiltonian 
</p>
<p>1 2 I 2 1 2 
H = 2A Px ' + 2B Py' + 2CPz" (4) 
</p>
<p>where Pz' is the component of the rotational angular momentum vector along the 
</p>
<p>Z', body-fixed principal axis, the H2 0 symmetry axis; similarly, the x' and y' axes 
</p>
<p>can be taken as the remaining principal axes, one perpendicular to the plane of the 
</p>
<p>triangle, the other lying in the triangle plane, all going through the center of mass 
</p>
<p>of the molecule. The constants A, B, C are the three principal moments of inertia 
</p>
<p>in the equilibrium configuration: Ixx = A, Iyy = B, Izz = C. The principal or 
</p>
<p>primed axes components of the rotational angular momentum vector, P, must be 
translated to operator form to write the above Hamiltonian in qmmtum-mechanical 
</p>
<p>form. Using the techniques of problem 5, these components are [converting from

<p>(JMKlPzVMK) = K. (14)

<p>(P~ is now a K step-up operator, and P~ is a K step-down operator. This results 
</p>
<p>because the commutation relations of the primed components of the rotational

<p>The Hamiltonian is not diagonal in the IJ M K} basis. In this basis, the diagonal

<p>in quantum theory, the transfonnation from one basis in Hilbert space to another. 
</p>
<p>In our example, it was a transfonnation from the 11M K) basis to the II ME,,) 
basis, involving two different complete sets of commuting operators to specify the 
</p>
<p>two different bases. In our specific example of the 1 = I energy eigenstates, the 
transformation was a very simple one, in a 3-D subspace of the asymmetric rotator 
</p>
<p>subspace of the full Hilbert space of our problem, and thus it involved a 3 x 3 
</p>
<p>transfonnation. 
</p>
<p>For a general state vector, 11fr}, in the asymmetric rotator subspace of the Hilbert 
space of the polyatomic molecule system, we could use either the representation

<p>Another Example: Successive 
Polarization Filters for Beams of Spin 
</p>
<p>s == ~ Particles 
</p>
<p>So far, our first example of a unitary transformation from one basis to another 
</p>
<p>involved a finite-dimensional unitary submatrix. Let us consider one more example 
</p>
<p>of this type, an even simpler example involving spin s = 1 particles, hence, 
a 2 x 2-dimensional transformation. Suppose we have a beam of spin s = 1 
particles. They can be prepared, so all are in a state of definite spin orientation, 
</p>
<p>say, with ms = +1, or with ms = -1, along some specific z-direction in 3-D 
</p>
<p>space by passing the beam through a polarization filter. The historically first such 
</p>
<p>filter is that employed by Stem and Gerlach involving a set of three magnets, with 
</p>
<p>nonuniform magnetic fields, placed in succession along the beam line, so a set of 
</p>
<p>baffles can eliminate the particles with one of the two spin orientations. Other types 
</p>
<p>of sophisticated polarization filters exist. (For a reference to modem polarization 
</p>
<p>filters, see, e.g., Polarized Beams and Polarized Gas Targets, Hans Paetz gen. 
</p>
<p>Schieck and Lutz Sydow, eds. World Scientific, 1996). We will assume the filter 
</p>
<p>is perfect and prepares particles in a pure state of very definite ms along a specific 
</p>
<p>z-direction. Suppose the first such filter is followed with a second filter, identical 
</p>
<p>to the first, but now with its new z' axis oriented along some new direction, given 
</p>
<p>by polar and azimuth angles, () and,p, relative to the original x, y, z axes, and set 
for some definite m~ along the new direction. What fraction of the s = 1-particles 
</p>
<p>will pass through the second filter? 
</p>
<p>The first filter prepares particles in eigenstates 1m = &plusmn; 1), which are eigenstates 
of S2 and Sz: 
</p>
<p>(1) </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>The second filter passes particles in the eigenstates la = &plusmn; ~}, which are eigenstates 
of 52 and Sz&lt; 
</p>
<p>(2) 
</p>
<p>The answer to our problem is as follows: The probability a particle in the beam 
</p>
<p>with definite I ~ m} will pass through the second filter set to pass a specific I ~a} is 
</p>
<p>(3) 
</p>
<p>so we need to calculate the transformation coefficient (4al~m} = Uam.1t will be 
advantageous to switch to the operator (j, via 5 = 4(j. and to omit the common s 
quantum number of ~ in all equations. Here, (j is the Pauli spin operator, whose 
</p>
<p>components ax, ay, az lead to the three Pauli spin matrices, we have already met 
</p>
<p>through eq. (38) of Chapter 14. Thus, 
</p>
<p>(4) 
</p>
<p>with Am = &plusmn;1 for states with m = &plusmn;~, and Aa = &plusmn;1 for states with a = &plusmn;~.

</p>
<p>Left-multiplying by a specific (m'lleads to 
</p>
<p>L(m'laz,lm)(mla) = Aa(m'la}.

<p>Now we can express az, in terms of the original x, y, z components of a 
</p>
<p>az' = sin fJ cos 4Jax + sin fJ sin 4Jay + cos fJaz,

<p>Transfonnation Theory for Systems 
</p>
<p>with Continuous Spectra 
</p>
<p>So far, we have studied transformations from one basis to another only for 
</p>
<p>basis vectors that are the eigenvectors of a set of commuting hermitian opera-
</p>
<p>tors whose spectra are discrete. Moreover, we have studied finite-dimensional 
</p>
<p>subspaces of these vector spaces, so our unitary transformation matrices were 
</p>
<p>finite-dimensionaL Commuting operators, however, such as the operators x, y, 
</p>
<p>z or the operators Px, py, pz exist with continuous spectra. Still other operators 
have both discrete and continuous spectra. We need to study the transformation 
</p>
<p>theory for the base vectors of this type. In particular, the coordinate and momentum 
</p>
<p>representations are of great importance. 
</p>
<p>In the coordinate representation, we project state vectors I''') onto the base 
vectors Iro) that are simultaneous eigenvectors of the three operators x, y, z, 
</p>
<p>(1) 
</p>
<p>The spectrum is continuous, so the orthogonality relation is given by a Dirac delta

<p>and the completeness condition is given by the closure relation

</p>
<p>with o = F(x, y, z), (;~I 0 Ira) = F(xo, Yo, zo)o(r~ - ro), (6)

</p>
<p>(7) 
</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, an operator, 0, is a function of the momentum operators P x, 
</p>
<p>Py, Pz, it will be useful to transform to the momentum representation, with base 
</p>
<p>vectors that are the eigenvectors of the momentum operators 
</p>
<p>Pzlpo} = pzoIPo}. (8) 
</p>
<p>We shall be particularly interested in the unitary transformation matrix (po Ira}. 
We could, of course, use Fourier integral analysis, from which we know the result. 
</p>
<p>Let us, however, rederive this transformation matrix to learn how to deal with 
</p>
<p>base vectors with continuous spectra. It will, in particular, be useful to introduce 
</p>
<p>a unitary operator, the translation operator, which will serve our purpose. 
</p>
<p>A The Translation Operator 
</p>
<p>Consider the operator 
</p>
<p>(9) 
</p>
<p>where C = (Cl' C2, C3) and the Cj are ordinary numbers, so-called "c-numbers," the 
components of p are operators. We then have the commutator relations 
</p>
<p>Ii au 
[X Uj = --- = clU 
</p>
<p>, i oPx ' 
(10) 
</p>
<p>with similar equations for the commutators [y, Uj, [z, Uj. These relations lead to 
</p>
<p>(11) 
</p>
<p>Thus, the new eigenvector obtained by acting with U on Ira} is an eigenvector of 
the operator, x, with eigenvalue (xo + Cl), similarly, for the y and z components. 
Therefore, 
</p>
<p>(12) 
</p>
<p>or 
</p>
<p>(13) 
</p>
<p>We see the translation character of the operator U. The translation operator, U = 
e-Fp , can be regarded from two points of view as follows. </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>B Coordinate Representation Matrix Elements of Px 169 
</p>
<p>(1) Passive point of view. Action on base vectors. From this point of view, of 
</p>
<p>eq. (12), the operator U(C) acts on a base vector Iro} and converts it to a new base 
vector Iro + c}, but the physical system is not translated. This process is illustrated 
by Fig. 18.1(a), where the physical system is illustrated by the maximum in its 
</p>
<p>probability density at x = a. By shifting the origin of the coordinate system to 
</p>
<p>the left a distance c], the maximum of the probability density lies at a + c] in the 
translated coordinate system. 
</p>
<p>(2) Active point of view. Action on the physical system. In this point of view, the 
</p>
<p>coordinate axes remain fixed, but the physical system is translated by the action of 
</p>
<p>the operator U (C) from its original position given by a vector ii to a new position 
described by the vector ii + c. Now, we let U act on the original state vector 11/I} 
to make a new, translated, state vector 11/I'} 
</p>
<p>U(C)11/I} = 11/I'}, (14) 
</p>
<p>so the original probability amplitude function 1/I(r) is shifted to a new probability 
amplitude function 1/I'(r), with 
</p>
<p>1/I'(r) = (rI1/l') = (rlU(C)11/I) = (1/IIUT lr)* 
</p>
<p>= (1/IIe+F'-Plr)* = (1/I1r - c)* = (r - c11/l) = 1/I(r - C). (15) 
</p>
<p>Now, if the original1/l(r) had a maximum atr = a, the translated 1/I'(r) = 1/I(r-C) 
will have a maximum at (r - C) = ii, or at r = (ii + C); i.e., the physical system 
has been translated along the positive direction of the vector c. This process is 
illustrated in Fig. 18.1 (b). 
</p>

<p>If at time to the state of the system is specified by 11/I(to&raquo;), what is the state of 
the system at a later time, t; i.e., what is 11/I(t&raquo;)? If a measurement is made on

<p>the system of some observable A (or B, etc.), the time-evolution of the quantum

<p>have to be studied, and it may not be practical to consider this larger system. For an

<p>The coherent states la} (or Iz}) then give us another continuous representation 
</p>
<p>of an arbitrary state vector 11/I} of a physical system. Besides the. discrete oscillator 
quanta representation, (n 11/1), we already have two continuous representations, the 
coordinate representation (x 11/1) and the momentum representation (p x 11/1 ), where 
the operators x and Px have a continuous range of eigenvalues from -00 --+ +00. 
</p>
<p>We can now add the coherent state representation (aI1/l), where a is a complex 
</p>
<p>number, 
</p>
<p>a = ~ +i17 = pei 4&gt;,

<p>and ~ and 17 range from -00 --+ +00, and p ranges from 0 --+ 00 and fjJ from

<p>0--+ 21r. Unlike (xI1/l) and (PxI1/l), however, which are orthonormal, continuous 
</p>
<p>representations of 11/1), with

</p>
<p>The coherent states, however, are complete. In fact, with relations (57) or (58), in 
</p>
<p>place of the Dirac 0 functions, the coherent states are overcomplete. The complete-

<p>The minimum uncertainties for the coherent state can now be understood because

<p>these are the probabilities for the space and momentum distributions of a displaced 
</p>
<p>oscillator in its n = 0 lowest state, with a displacement +~ffi(a) in coordinate

</p>
<p>will move with time without change of shape (see problems 10 lmd 11). This is the 
</p>
<p>motion of a coherent wave packet. 
</p>
<p>Just as state vectors can be given in the coherent state representation, (all/t), 
</p>
<p>physical quantities represented by operators, 0, can also be given in the coherent 
</p>
<p>state representation. In the oscillator quantum number representation, we mul-
</p>
<p>tiplied an operator, 0, by unit operators on the left and on the right to yield, 
</p>
<p>o = Ln.m In) (nl 0 1m) (mi. Similarly, we could represent 0 by

<p>the 8 function relation, (x'lx) = 8(x' - x). Because this relation does not exist in 
the coherent state representation, the analagous operator relations must be handled </p>

<p>with some care. For the harmonic oscillator, an operator, 0, can be expressed as 
</p>
<p>a function of the basic operators, a t and a, O(a t, a). We want to express such an 
</p>
<p>operator as a function of z and 818z. We have purposely chosen z in place of Ct 
because a type II coherent state will be somewhat simpler for this purpose. For 
</p>
<p>type II coherent states, z-space realizations of state vectors, (zll/t), are given by the 
</p>
<p>Bargmann transforms, F(z) = LnCnZn 1.JnT. The scalar product in the complex z-
space involves the Bargmann measure, e-zz* Ix. In this scalar product, the operator 
818z is the adjoint of the operator z. Given two Bargmann-space functions,

<p>we have (using the orthonormality of the zn ;.JnT)

</p>
<p>z(21 - Zd/dZ) convert a z-space function, z", into a z-space function, Z"+I, so eq. 
</p>
<p>(100) becomes 
</p>
<p>z(21 - n)(K K T)" = (K KT)n+IZ. 
</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the equation, the action of K K;' follows the action of

<p>the operator z and Zd/dZ(Zn) = n(zll). We therefore have

<p>(KK';')

(K KT)n 
</p>
<p>Because the Bargmann state with n = 0 has the same normalization as the angular

<p>momentum eigenstate, 11, M = - 1), we have (K Kt)o = 1. Iterating the above

<p>T (21)! 
(K K )11 = 21(21 - 1) ... (21 + I - n) = .

<p>The hermitian operator, K K t, must have real eigenvalues. In our special case, K is

<p>the simple command: Multiply (zll /"fiJ) by an n-dependent factor. We can make

</p>
<p>Note: The angular momentum operators, lk' generate the group SO(3) (the

<p>special orthogonal transformations in three dimensions, with determinant = + 1), 
in the case when j are integers, or SU(2) (the special unitary transformations in

</p>
<p>one plus sign in the operator y2. 
</p>
<p>Solution for Problem 23: The SO(2,1 ) Algebra 
</p>
<p>The various commutator relations follow from the given commutation relations by 
</p>
<p>simple commutator algebra. For example, 
</p>
<p>[h T2] = -T][T3, TIl- [h TdT] - T2[h Tz] - [h T2]Tz 
</p>
<p>= -iT]T2 - iTzT] + iT2T] + iT]T2 = o. (2) 
</p>
<p>We are interested in the simultaneous eigenvectors of the two commuting 
</p>
<p>hermitian operators, T3 and y2, 
</p>
<p>T 2IAm} = AIAm}, 
</p>
<p>T3IAm} = mIAm}. (3) 
</p>
<p>Let us consider the new vectors, T &plusmn; I Am}. Acting on either of these with both y2 
</p>
<p>and T3 , we get (with the use of the commutation relations), 
</p>
<p>T2(T+IAm}) = T+T2IAm) = A(T+IAm)), 
</p>
<p>T3(T+IAm}) = T+T3IAm} + T+IAm} = (m + 1)(T+IAm)). (4) 
</p>
<p>Thus, if lAm} is simultaneously an eigenvector of y2 and T3 , with eigenvalues 
</p>
<p>A and m, either (T+IAm)) is simultaneously an eigenvector of y2 and T3 with 
</p>
<p>eigenvalues A and (m + 1) or (T+IAm)) = O. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>T2(LIAm}) = LTzIAm} = A(LIAm}), 
</p>
<p>T3(LIAm}) = LT3IAm) - T_IAm} = (m - l)(LIAm}). (5) 
</p>
<p>Thus, if lAm) is simultaneously an eigenvector of y2 and T3 , with eigenvalues 
</p>
<p>A and m, either (T_IAm}) is simultaneously an eigenvector of y2 and T3 with 
</p>
<p>eigenvalues A and (m - 1); or ( L I Am}) = O. To investigate these two possibilities, 
</p>
<p>let us rewrite y2 
</p>
<p>T2 = Tl- T]2 - Tl = T02 - ~(T+L + LT+) = T~ - T+L - To

<p>Now, let us take the diagonal matrix element of these two relations between states 
</p>
<p>with the same A, m, assuming a state lAm) exists, viz., it leads to a square-integrable 
</p>
<p>eigenfunction. First, 
</p>
<p>(AmIT+LIAm) = (Cm2 - m) - A)

</p>
<p>where we have used (AmIT+-IAm') = (Am'ILiAm)* and have summed over a 
</p>
<p>complete set of intermediate states. We must have m' = (m - 1). By including a 
</p>
<p>sum over states with m' = (m - 1), we have allowed for the possibility more than 
one independent state with that restriction exists. Similarly, we have 
</p>
<p>(AmILT+IAm) = (m 2 +m)-A) 
</p>
<p>= LI(Am'IT+IAm)1 2 2: O. 
tn' 
</p>
<p>(9) 
</p>
<p>We have the two patently positive quantities of eqs. (7) and (8) only if the two 
</p>
<p>functions, f(m) = (m 2 -m)-A) or (Cm2+m) A) are equaltoorgreaterthan zero. 
The two functions ofm, (m 2 =fm), have minima atm = &plusmn;!, both with a minimum 
value of - ~. Unlike the corresponding operator of the angular momentum algebra, 
</p>
<p>with its slightly different commutation relations, the operator, 7 2 , is no longer 
</p>
<p>a sum of positive hermitian operators. Thus, the eigenvalue, A, could be either 
</p>
<p>positive or negative. In particular, if A &lt; -- i, the quantities [(m 2 =f m) - A 1 are 
positive for all values of m, positive or negative. Thus, all values of &plusmn;m are possible, 
</p>
<p>and for any A, such that A &lt; - ~, we have a continuous spectrum of allowed values 
</p>
<p>for both A and m. Conversely, if A &gt; 0, and if an eigenvalue, mo &gt; &deg; exists, such 
that &laquo;m6 - mo) - A) &gt; 0, the step-down action of n operations with T could 
</p>
<p>eventually lead to an (ma - n) such that ((ma - n)(mo - n - 1) - A) &lt; 0, and eq. 
(7) would lead to an inconsistency. A patently positive quantity on one side of eq. 
</p>
<p>(7) would be equal to a negative quantity on the other side. Hence, our assumption 
</p>
<p>of the existence of a square-integrable iAmo) must have been incorrect. If ma, 
</p>
<p>however, is such that an integer n exists such that (ma - n) == mmin, so 
</p>
<p>and [mmiIl_(mmin_ - 1) - AJ = 0, (10) 
</p>
<p>an inconsistency never exists. If we name 
</p>
<p>A = j(j + 1), (11) 
</p>
<p>with j 2: 0, to be as close as possible to the language of the angular momentum 
</p>
<p>algebra, the solution to [mmin(mmin ----- 1)---- AJ = &deg; gives us mrnin. = (j + I). Only 
the positive root has meaning in this case. Also, the quantum number j is only 
</p>
<p>a language to give us the eigenvalue A. In this case, j may not be an integer or </p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Problems 195 
</p>
<p>half-integer. The actual values of mmin. = (j + 1) and A = j (j + I) will depend on 
the detailed properties of the operators 'J"2 and T3, i.e., on the specific nature of the 
physics of the problem. If the nature of the problem is such that the eigenvalues of 
</p>
<p>'J"2 and T3 must all be positive definite, we are done. The spectrum is given by 
</p>
<p>m = mmin., (mmin. + 1), ... , (mmin., +n), ... , ~ 00, 
</p>
<p>m = (j + 1), (j + 2), ... , (j + 1 + n), ... , ~ 00, with A = j(j + 1). 
</p>
<p>[The possible m-values can go to 00. This follows because for mmin. &gt; 0, the 
</p>
<p>quantity(m~in.+mmin.-A) = 2m min. &gt; o and thus [(mmin.+n)(mmin.+n+I)-A] &gt; 
o for any positive integer n, so the state (T+IA(mmin. + n)}) exists; i.e., the state 
IA(mmin. + n + I)} also leads to a square-integrable eigenfunction.] 
</p>
<p>Let us next examine the possibility the operators 'J"2 and T3 are such that A &gt; 0, 
butm &lt; O. Now let us suppose some mo = -Imol exists; i.e., the state lA, -Imol} 
</p>
<p>leads to square-integrable eigenfunctions. Now, if eq. (8) is satisfied for m = 
</p>
<p>-Imol, i.e., ImolClmol + 1) - A&gt; 0, the state with m = (-Imol - n) leads to an 
</p>
<p>m(m -1) -A = (Imol +n)(lmol +n + 1) -A also&gt; 0, so n actions with L would 
</p>
<p>lead to another allowed state. However, n actions with the step-up operator, T+, 
</p>
<p>would lead to a state with m = -Imol + n, for which the function [(m 2 + m) - A1 
</p>
<p>of eq. (9) would lead to the value [(Imol - n)(lmol - n - 1) - A], which for large 
</p>
<p>enough n could now be negative. Thus, eq. (9) would say that a patently positive 
</p>
<p>quantity is equal to a function that can become a negative quantity for a large 
</p>
<p>enough n. Now, a state lA, -Imol} can be an allowed state only if an integer n 
</p>
<p>exists, such that m = (-Imol + n) == mmax. and 
</p>
<p>so that (mmax.(mmax. + 1) - A) = 0, (12) 
</p>
<p>where now mmax. must be the negative root of the equation: (mrnax.(mmax. + 1)-
</p>
<p>j(j + 1&raquo; = 0; that is, mmax. = -4 - JA + ~ = -(j + 1). In this case, therefore, 
the spectrum of possible m-values is 
</p>
<p>-00, ... , -(j+l+n), ... , -(j+2), -(j+l) = mmax., again withA = j(j+l). 
</p>
<p>Now, however, for general A = j (j + I) &gt; 0, the two branches of allowed m values 
</p>
<p>are unconnected, so the commutator algebra of the T; does not lead to additional 
</p>
<p>restrictions on A and, hence, j. In particular, j need not be an integer or a half-
</p>
<p>integer. The physics of the operators T3 , 'J"2, dictate the nature of the eigenvalues 
m and A. Thus, for some physical applications for which the eigenvalues of T3 can 
</p>
<p>be positive only, only the positive branch of allowed m values can exist. 
</p>
<p>Let us now finally use eqs. (1) and (8) to find the matrix elements of the operators 
</p>
<p>T &plusmn;. We shall look at the simple case, in which the states 
</p>
<p>or 
</p>
<p>are nondegenerate; i.e., the two relations 
</p>
<p>LIAmmin.} = 0 and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>196 Problems 
</p>
<p>are assumed to have only one allowed solution. This would of course be automatic 
</p>
<p>if these two relations lead to first-order differential equations. In this case, action 
</p>
<p>with T+ or L, respectively, would lead to a single (nondegenerate) state with the 
</p>
<p>appropriate m value. Thus, all states in the ladder of either positive or negative m 
</p>
<p>values might be expected to be nondegenerate, and the sums over m' in eqs. (8) 
</p>
<p>and (9) would collapse to a single term with m' = (m - 1) or m' = (m + I), 
respectively. For branches of allowed m values, eq. (9) tells us 
</p>
<p>l(j(m + 1)IT+lim)1 2 = m(m + I) - j(j + I) = (m - j)(m + j + 1). (13) 
</p>
<p>This relation leads to no upper limit for positive m values with m :::: (j + I), but 
leads to a zero matrix element for m = -(j + 1) within the branch of negative m 
values. Similarly, eq. (8) leads to 
</p>
<p>l(j(m - 1)ILljm)12 = m(m - I) - j(j + I) = (m + j)(m - j - 1). (14) 
</p>
<p>Now, no zero matrix elements exist for the negative branch with m :::: -(j + 1), but 
this matrix element is automatically zero if m = (j + 1). As for the corresponding 
angular momentum problem, eqs. (13) and (14) do not fix the phases of these matrix 
</p>
<p>elements. If we choose these phases such that the matrix elements of T+, T_ are 
</p>
<p>real, we have 
</p>
<p>(j(m + 1)IT+ljm) = .j(m - j)(m + j + 1), 
(j(m - 1)ILljm) = J(m + j)(m - j - 1). 
</p>
<p>(In particular, these equations satisfy (jm'IL Ijm) = (jmIT+ljm')*.) 
</p>
<p>(15) 
</p>
<p>Final remark: The operators lx = 11, lv = h, l z = h of the angular-
momentum algebra, which commute with the operator JZ = lIZ + 1] + 11 are the 
generators of infinitesimal rotations in three-space about the x, y, and z axes and 
thus connected with the group SO(3), the "special orthogonal group in three di-
</p>
<p>mensions" (where the "special" means the 3 x 3 orthogonal rotation matrices have 
</p>
<p>determinant + 1, leading to pure rotations and not including rotation reflections). 
The operators TI , Tz, T3, which commute with the operator, T = T3Z - T( - T22 , 
conversely, are related in a similar way with a 3-D space with two space-like and 
</p>
<p>one time-like dimension and thus connected with the group SO(2,1). As for the 
</p>
<p>SO(3) group, most of the properties of the group SO(2,1) follow from the matrix 
</p>
<p>elements of the Ii, which are now known to us. 
Finally, the angular momentum operators, h are related to the ladder operators 
</p>
<p>of case 3 C(m) of the factorization method, whereas the T &plusmn; of the SO(2,I) algebra 
</p>
<p>are related to the ladder operators of case 4 C(m) of the factorization method.

<p>Perturbation Theory 
</p>
<p>A Introductory Remarks 
</p>
<p>If we have a Hamiltonian for which we cannot find exact eigenvalues and eigenvec-
</p>
<p>tors, we can in principle use the technique employed for the asymmetric rotator for 
</p>
<p>more challenging problems. If for the moment In) is shorthand for the eigenvectors 
</p>
<p>for a complete set of commuting operators, including the Hamiltonian in question, 
</p>
<p>and la) is shorthand for the eigenvectors of another complete set of commuting op-
</p>
<p>erators, spanning the same subspace of Hilbert space, but now including a simpler 
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian, Ro, for which we do know the eigenvalues and eigfmvectors, we can 
</p>
<p>expand the unknown eigenvectors In) in terms of the known la). From a knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of the matrix elements, (a'IHla), we can in principle diagonalize the matrix 
</p>
<p>in this basis for Ho to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the needed H. 
</p>
<p>The difficulty, of course, is that in general this matrix will be infinite-dimensional. 
</p>
<p>With modem computers, however, it may be possible to diagonalize this matrix in 
</p>
<p>an N x N limit, where N is taken to be a large number, and then test the possible 
</p>
<p>convergence as N grows even larger. This method will be particularly successful 
</p>
<p>if H differs from a known Ho by terms that can be classified by a parameter of 
</p>
<p>smallness, A, with A &laquo; 1. Then, we can study the "corrections" to the eigenvalues 
and eigenvectors in a very systematic way as a power series in A. This will be the 
</p>
<p>first detailed study of the next chapter, which will include: 
</p>
<p>(1) stationary-state or time-independent perturbation theory, 
</p>
<p>(a) Rayleigh-SchrOdinger expansion, 
</p>
<p>(b) Wigner-Brillouin expansion. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>204 20. Perturbation Theory 
</p>
<p>This study will be in contrast to time-dependent perturbation theory, which will 
</p>
<p>be covered in a later chapter; where we will make a similar expansion of the time-
</p>
<p>dependent integral ofeq. (13) of Chapter 19. Other approximation techniques, also 
</p>
<p>to be covered in later chapters, are the WKB or semiclassical approximation and 
</p>
<p>variational methods. 
</p>
<p>The WKB approximation will be treated only after a long excursion on angular 
</p>
<p>momentum theory, Part III of the course. Variational methods useful for the n 
</p>
<p>electron atom will be discussed in Part IV of the course on systems of identical 
</p>
<p>particles. 
</p>
<p>B Transition Probabilities 
</p>
<p>Before proceeding with stationary-state perturbation theory, it will be advanta-
</p>
<p>geous to give a very brief first discussion of transition probabilities to answer the 
</p>
<p>question: What is the probability an atomic system in an excited eigenstate, En, 
</p>
<p>will make a transition to a lower state, Em, through the spontaneous emission of 
</p>
<p>a photon? To answer this question in a rigorous way, we will have to study both 
</p>
<p>the atomic system and the electromagnetic field quantum mechanically; i.e., we 
</p>
<p>would have to quantize the electromagnetic field and then study the interaction 
</p>
<p>of the quantized electromagnetic field (photon) with the atomic system. Because 
</p>
<p>we will save the study of time-dependent perturbation theory for a later chapter, 
</p>
<p>we will do this in a rigorous fashion then. To have a formula for the transition 
</p>
<p>probability for the spontaneous emission of a photon, however, let us give a very 
</p>
<p>brief "plausibility" argument for the transition probability formula now. This will 
</p>
<p>actually be the historically first (the so-called Bohr correspondence principle) ar-
</p>
<p>gument for this formula. (Keep in mind, however, the rigorous derivation will 
</p>
<p>come later. Historically, it also came later with a famous paper by Dirac on the 
</p>
<p>quantization of the electromagnetic field.) 
</p>
<p>The Bohr argument goes as follows: Classically, a charged particle in motion will 
</p>
<p>emit electromagnetic radiation only if the particle is accelerated. Quantitatively, 
</p>
<p>the classical result is given by the Larmor formula, which calculates the energy 
</p>
<p>loss per unit time of the charged particle (or a system of N charged particles) to 
</p>
<p>the emission of electromagnetic radiation (in c.g.s. units), 
</p>
<p>dE 2e2 ~2 
- -- =-a 
</p>
<p>dt 3c3 
(1) 
</p>
<p>where iii is the acceleration vector of the ith particle with charge ei. The classical 
recipe for calculating this energy loss for a system of N moving particles involves 
</p>
<p>the Fourier time analysis for the three components of the electric dipole moment 
</p>

<p>LeiZi = LIL~Z)(einwt + e-inwt ), (2) 
i=1 n 
</p>
<p>assuming for the moment the time-dependent functions are real. Then, according 
</p>
<p>to classical theory, the frequencies radiated are the classical mechanical frequency 
</p>
<p>and its overtones, v = w/21t, and nv (or in the case of multiple-periodic systems, 
</p>
<p>the classical frequencies and their overtones or combination tones, nl VI + n2V2, 
etc.). Taking the second time derivatives of the Xi, Yi, Zi of eq. (2), the classically 
</p>
<p>predicted energy loss to the nth overtone (time-averaged over one cycle) would 
</p>
<p>have been 
</p>
<p>Of course, this classical result is incorrect. This is what troubled Niels Bohr from 
</p>
<p>1913 to 1925. First, this result does not predict the observed frequencies. The 
</p>
<p>hydrogen spectrum is not a fundamental frequency and its n overtones. Even 
</p>
<p>worse, this classical result predicts the frequencies should change with time. As 
</p>
<p>the system loses energy and the mechanical energy becomes more negative, the 
</p>
<p>Kepler frequencies (or the Bohr "1913 frequencies") would increase with time; 
</p>
<p>the electron would spiral in to the proton and suffer a catastrophe in a time of the 
</p>
<p>order of 10-8 seconds. Bohr argued, however, the classically predicted frequency, 
</p>
<p>nw, should be replaced by the Bohr frequency, W nm ' and the classically predicted 
</p>
<p>Fourier coefficients, 1L~j), should be replaced by a two-index quantity, 1L&lt;j2, which 
he identified with the Heisenberg matrix element. Thus,

</p>
<p>This argument is the Bohr correspondence principle, which yields the result

<p>(4) 
</p>
<p>(5) 
</p>
<p>where the operators are ILx = Ef eiXi, and so on. To convert this principle to a 
transition probability, introduce the "Einstein A," 
</p>
<p>- [dE] = hVnm An-4m Nn,

</p>
<p>(6) 
</p>
<p>where h Vnm is the energy of the emitted photon, A n ..... m ' gives the probability per 
</p>
<p>unit time for the spontaneous emission of a photon with this frequency, and Nn is-
</p>
<p>the number of atoms in the initial state, n. The transition probability per second the 
</p>
<p>atom makes a transition from an excited state, n, to a lower state, m, is therefore </p>

An-?m = 3hc3 Vnm l(nIJLxim)1 + l(niJLylm)i + l(nIJLzlm)i . (7) 
</p>
<p>If the matrix elements of the three electric dipole moment components are all zero, 
</p>
<p>the transition is "forbidden." The correspondence principle argument then gives 
</p>
<p>the correct result. A rigorous derivation will be given in a later chapter, when 
</p>
<p>we shall quantize the electromagnetic field and introduce the interaction between 
</p>
<p>the quantized electromagnetic field (photons) and the isolated atomic system. The 
</p>
<p>above electric dipole result, however, is only the dominant term in an expansion 
</p>
<p>involving a series in powers of ai).., where a gives the size of the atomic system and 
</p>
<p>A is the wavelength of the emitted photon. Higher order terms will involve matrix 
</p>
<p>elements of magnetic moment operators, electric quadrupole moment operators, 
</p>
<p>and even higher magnetic and electric multipole moments. In nuclei, these higher 
</p>
<p>order terms are often important. 
</p>
<p>Finally, we make a remark about induced absorption and emission processes. If 
</p>
<p>the atomic system is in a beam or a bath of photons, the probability for induced 
</p>
<p>absorption and emission processes is given by the "Einstein B"s and by P(vnm ), 
</p>
<p>the energy density of the electromagnetic radiation (photon beam). Through his 
</p>
<p>study of the black-body radiation spectrum, Einstein found the relation 
</p>
<p>c3 
Bm--&gt;n = Bn-?m = 8 h 3 A n-+m, 
</p>

</p>
<p>where the probability per unit time of an induced absorption process is

<p>and the probability per unit time of an induced emission process is

</p>
<p>(8) 
</p>
<p>(9) 
</p>
<p>(10) 
</p>
<p>where p(vnm ) is the energy per unit volume of the photon beam at the transition 
</p>
<p>frequency, and Nn and Nm are the number of atoms in state nand m, respectively.

</p>
<p>N2, have no permanent electric dipole moment. Their pure rotational transitions 
</p>
<p>can therefore only be seen in Raman spectroscopy.)

<p>Recall the rotational energies and wave functions are given by

<p>the number of photons emitted per second. Your numerical answer should explain

<p>why such spectra are observed as absorption spectra rather than emission spectra. 
</p>
<p>That is, the spontaneous emission process is very unlikely, so diatomic molecule 
</p>
<p>rotational transitions are observed by utilizing the stimulated absorption and emis-
</p>
<p>sion process for incident radiation of the appropriate frequency in the far infrared 
</p>
<p>or microwave region. To come to the same conclusion, also calculate the lifetime

<p>in seconds of the first excited rotational state, with J = 1, and compare this result

<p>To solve the first-order equation, first left-multiply this equation with (n(O)I, to

</p>
<p>where H(O) acting on a Ik(O&raquo; will simply yield EkO)lk(O&raquo;. 
</p>
<p>C Second-Order Corrections 
</p>
<p>To get the second-order corrections to the energy, let us (always the first step!) 
</p>
<p>left-multiply the second-order equation by (n(O) I to get 
</p>
<p>_ (n(O)I(H(O) _ E~0&raquo;ln(2&raquo; = (n(O)IH(1) - E~l)ln(1&raquo; + (n(0)IH(2)ln(0)} - E~2). (23) 
</p>
<p>The left-hand side is again zero [think of "left action" of (H(O) -- E~O&raquo; on (n(O)I], 
</p>
<p>so, substituting for In(l)} in the right-hand side, 
</p>
<p>r: (n(O)IH(l)lk(O&raquo; (k(O)IH(I)ln(O&raquo; E(2) = (n(0)IH(2)ln(0&raquo; + ,

n n n ~ (0) (0)

</p>
<p>(25) 
</p>
<p>This formula, together with the result for the first-order correction, E~I), eq. (11), 
</p>
<p>was named by Fermi as "Golden Rule I." (We shall meet an analagous "Golden 
</p>
<p>Rule II" in time-dependent perturbation theory!), Fermi said most of the interesting 
</p>
<p>results of quantum theory can be calculated with these Golden Rules. (Note also: 
</p>
<p>If In) is the ground state of the system, the perturbations caused by the higher 
</p>
<p>states will "push down" and lower the ground-state energy. The second term then 
</p>
<p>has patently positive numerators and negative denominators.) 
</p>
<p>To obtain the second-order correction to the state vector, In(2)}, we again 
</p>
<p>decompose this into a part proportional to In(O&raquo; and a part orthogonal to In(O&raquo;, 
</p>
<p>In(2&raquo; = c~2)ln(0&raquo; + Q~0)ln(2&raquo;. (26) </p>

<p>Now, we still need to evaluate c~2) = (n(O) In(2&raquo;), which is again chosen to normalize

<p>Example 1: The Slightly Anharmonic 
</p>
<p>Oscillator 
</p>
<p>In Chapter 15, we discussed the diatomic molecule, a complicated many-body 
</p>
<p>system. At low energies, however, we can neglect specific treatment of the elec-
</p>
<p>tron degrees of freedom. The electron cloud can in first approximation be taken as 
</p>
<p>the source of a potential binding the two atomic nuclei into a nearly rigid, vibrat-
</p>
<p>ing structure. The position of the atomic nuclei of the diatomic molecule in 3-D 
</p>
<p>space can be described by the three coordinates: r, the radial distance between the 
</p>
<p>two atomic nuclei, and e, and f/J, the two angles describing the orientation of the 
molecule axis in our 3-D space. The electron cloud gives rise to a potential (see 
</p>
<p>Fig. 22.1) with a deep minimum at r = reo where re is the eqUilibrium distance 
between the two nuclei. For very small values of r, the potential becomes strongly 
</p>
<p>repulsive and rises to 00. For very large values of r, the potential approaches a con-
</p>
<p>stant value of Vdiss,. If we can raise the energy above this value, i.e., if E &gt; Vdiss" 
</p>
<p>the molecule will dissociate into two atomic fragments. For E &lt;~ Vdiss" however, 
</p>
<p>the potential will be nearly parabolic and can be expanded about the value r = reo

<p>A number of remarks are in order: (1) The formula given here for the transition

<p>probabilities is for the true I-D anharmonic oscillator. It therefore assumes the 
</p>
<p>diatomic molecule remains oriented in a specific direction in space, say, the x-
</p>
<p>direction in a crystalline environment. In a free diatomic molecule, say, in a gaseous 
</p>
<p>sample in a microwave wave guide, the molecule is of course free to both rotate 
</p>
<p>and vibrate. To get the transition probabilities, we would need the matrix elements 
</p>
<p>of 
</p>
<p>M~el.) = Mr sine cos&lt;jJ, M~l.) = Mr sin e cos &lt;jJ, 
</p>
<p>with radial part, Mr, given by eq. (13). The matrix elements given by eqs. (14) and 
</p>
<p>(17) are just the radial (vibrational) part of the full electric dipole moment matrix 
</p>
<p>element. This must be augmented by the angular (rotational) matrix elements of 
</p>
<p>sine cos&lt;jJ, sine sin&lt;jJ, and cose. These matrix elements were actually evaluated 
</p>
<p>in Chapter 9. These matrix elements lead to the rotational selection rule, !J.l = &plusmn; 1. 
Therefore, the actual transition in a free diatomic molecule involves both a change 
</p>
<p>in vibrational quantum number, !J.n = &plusmn; 1, and a change in the rotational quantum 
number, !J.[ = &plusmn; I, leading to a vibration-rotation rather than to a pure vibrational 
transition. 
</p>
<p>(2): The actual numerical values of a vibrational transition pmbability, such as 
</p>
<p>that given by eq. (15), is very small, corresponding to inverse times of the order 
</p>
<p>of seconds or minutes, compared with an atomic electronic transition probability 
</p>
<p>corresponding to lifetimes of the order of 10-8 seconds. Molecular vibrational 
</p>
<p>or vibrational-rotational transitions are thus usually too weak to be seen in 
</p>
<p>spontaneous emission. They are easily observed, however, in induced absorption 
</p>
<p>processes, by placing the gaseous molecular sample in an electromagnetic beam of 
</p>
<p>the appropriate infrared or microwave frequency. The transition probabilities will 
</p>
<p>then be given by the Einstein B coefficients and the energy dens.ity of the incident

<p>beam. Because the Einstein B coefficients are proportional to the Einstein A coef-
</p>
<p>ficients, the results of this section will still be useful. Also, the induced emission

</p>
<p>assume gn independent eigenvectors exist such that 
</p>
<p>with r = 1, 2, ... , gn, (1) 
</p>
<p>where the label r may just be an ordinal label identifying the different eigenvectors, 
</p>
<p>or it may be a shorthand notation for additional quantum numbers. Clearly, our 
</p>
<p>previous method might lead to difficulties, because now zeros could be in the 
</p>
<p>energy denominators (E~O) - EiO&raquo;. A state Ik(O&raquo; different from Inr(O&raquo; could now 
</p>
<p>include a state with the same zeroth-order energy. Note, however, if H(l) is made 
</p>
<p>diagonal within the gn-dimensional subspace, Inr(O&raquo;, with r == 1,2, ... ,gn, this 
</p>
<p>difficulty will never arise. Therefore, the first step of the perturbation expansion

<p>The first task in the case of degenerate-level perturbation theory then is to find

<p>those linear combinations of the zeroth-order eigenvectors Ins(O)} that diagonalize 
</p>
<p>H(l). These so-called proper or stabilized zeroth-order eigenvectors will be the 
</p>
<p>basis for the subsequent steps in the perturbation expansion. Three possibilities 
</p>
<p>need to be considered. 
</p>
<p>B Three Cases of Degenerate Levels 
</p>
<p>Case (1): The initial basis Inr(OJ} may already be such that H(l) is diagonal in this 
</p>
<p>basis. (If higher order terms exist, such as H(2), we assume they are also diagonal 
</p>
<p>in this basis.) This may not be such a fortuitous accident. Often, we choose the 
</p>
<p>initial basis to be adapted to the symmetry of the problem. Both H(O) and H(I) may 
</p>
<p>have symmetries that naturally lead to a proper choice of basis. The choice of this 
</p>
<p>proper or symmetry-adapted basis may obviate the first step in degenerate-level 
</p>
<p>perturbation theory, the diagonalization of H(I) in the initial zeroth-order basis. 
</p>
<p>Effectively, therefore, such a case can be treated by nondegenerate perturbation 
</p>
<p>theory. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>C Higher Order Corrections with Proper Zeroth-Order Basis 223 
</p>
<p>Other cases now exist in which the nondegenerate perturbation theory formu-
</p>
<p>lae of Chapter 21 are sufficient to some order in the parameter of smallness, A. 
</p>
<p>For example, suppose two (or more) degenerate states Inr(O&raquo;) and Ins(O&raquo;) are not 
</p>
<p>connected with each other through second order. Assume they are connected with 
</p>
<p>each other only in third order, either through the action of H(I) three times, or 
</p>
<p>through terms such as 
</p>
<p>(ns(O) I H(I) In" u(O&raquo;) (nil u(O) I H(I) In I teo&raquo;) (n I t(O)! H(1) !nrO&raquo;) 
</p>
<p>in the perturbation expansion (or similar terms combining a single action of both 
</p>
<p>H(I) and H(2l ). In that case, if we are interested only in second-order corrections 
</p>
<p>to the energy, the degenerate states Inr(O&raquo;) and Ins(O&raquo;) are effectively unconnected 
</p>
<p>in second order and the nondegenerate perturbation theory formulae of Chapter 
</p>
<p>21 apply. 
</p>
<p>Case (2): The diagonalization of H(l) in the initial zeroth-order basis may lead 
f d&middot;&middot; . I E(1) . h E(I) -+ E(I) c -+ I h' to a set 0 gn- Istmct elgenva ues nr" Wit nr' -r- flS" lor r -r- s. ntis 
</p>
<p>case, the subsequent steps in the perturbation expansion closely parallel those for 
</p>
<p>nondegenerate-Ievel perturbation theory. 
</p>
<p>Case (3): The diagonalization of H(1) may not remove the zeroth-order degen-
</p>
<p>eracy completely. In this case, a special treatment is necessary. This treatment is 
</p>
<p>similar to that discussed in a next chapter for two (or several) nearly (or precisely) 
</p>
<p>degenerate levels, the toughest of all cases. Again, this case is not as uncommon 
</p>
<p>as might have been thought. For example, the symmetries of H(O) and H(1) could 
</p>
<p>be such that all matrix elements of ll(l) are zero in the inr(O&raquo;) sub-basis. Perhaps 
</p>
<p>the Inr(O&raquo;) all have the same parity and H(I) has the opposite parity. In this case, 
</p>
<p>we cannot diagonalize lIO) to find the proper zeroth-order basiis. 
</p>
<p>C Higher Order Corrections with Proper Zeroth-Order 
</p>
<p>Basis 
</p>
<p>Let us consider case (2). In this case, the first-order equation 
</p>
<p>(E~O) - H(O&raquo;lnr!(I&raquo;) = (H(!) - E~~;)!nr'(O&raquo;) 
</p>
<p>leads to

<p>D Application 1: Stark Effect in the Diatomic Molecule 
</p>
<p>Rigid Rotator 
</p>
<p>Let us consider a nonhomonuclear diatomic molecule, with a permanent electric 
</p>
<p>dipole moment, which is perturbed by an external electric field, { Let us consider 
</p>
<p>only the lowest energies ofthis system, so the molecule can be considered as a rigid 
</p>

(15) 
</p>
<p>with Ie = J.i.-r; and 
</p>
<p>with m = +1, ... , -t. (16) 
</p>
<p>The zth level, thus, has a e21 + 1 )-fold degeneracy, the general degeneracy associated 
with rotationally invariant sytems. In the presence of an external electric field, f, 
we must add a term 
</p>
<p>(17) 
</p>
<p>where we have assumed the electric field i is in the space-fixed z direction and 
the symmetry axis of the molecule makes a polar angle () with this z direction. 
</p>
<p>This Stark perturbation (Stark effect) is often used to identify the I values of initial 
</p>
<p>states in purely rotational transitions. To show H(l) is a weak perturbation, assume 
</p>
<p>the electric field is 1,000 Volts/cm, a strong field. The permanent electric dipole 
</p>
<p>moments, J.i.-e, of diatomic molecules are of order e x 10-8 cm. Thus, even in this 
</p>
<p>strong field, H(l) can be expected to be of order JOseY. Take the Hel molecule 
</p>
<p>as a specific example, so JL ~ mproton, with {-te 2 ~ 109 e V. Take re ~ 10-8cm </p>

</p>
<p>Then, 
</p>
<p>(18) 
</p>
<p>showing the Stark term, H(l), can indeed be treated as a perturbation. To calculate 
</p>
<p>the matrix elements of H(l), recall (Chapter 9)

<p>(21 + 1)(21 - 1) 
</p>
<p>(19) 
</p>
<p>(20) 
</p>
<p>Our H( 1) does not have matrix elements diagonal in the quantum number, I. No first-
</p>
<p>order contribution to the Stark energy shift occurs. At first, it appears this belongs 
</p>
<p>to case (3) of section B of this chapter and might require further treatment. All 
</p>
<p>matrix elements of the perturbing Hamiltonian, however, are diagonal in m. States 
</p>
<p>of a particular m are therefore completely unconnected from states of different 
</p>
<p>m. We can therefore treat states of a particular m by themselve,s, as if they were 
</p>
<p>unconnected from the rest, hence, by nondegenerate perturbation theory. This is 
</p>
<p>of course connected to the symmetry of our Hamiltonian, even, including the full 
</p>
<p>perturbation, our Hamiltonian has axial symmetry. Our zeroth-order state vectors, 
</p>
<p>of good eigenvalue m, are automatically the proper symmetry-adapted zeroth-
</p>
<p>order state vectors. (If we had chosen to call the direction of the &pound; field the x 
</p>
<p>rather than the z direction, our H( I) would have been - J1-e sin 0 cos cp&pound;. If we had 
diagonalized this H(I), we would essentially have effected a rotation from our 
</p>
<p>original x direction to a new Z direction. By choosing our z rather than our x 
</p>
<p>direction along the direction of the outside e, our zeroth-order state vectors have 
automatically become the proper ones for the perturbation calculation. 
</p>
<p>The second-order contributions to the energy are then simply

<p>The Case of Nearly Degenerate Levels 
</p>
<p>[Alternatively, the results of this section can also be used for precisely degenerate 
</p>
<p>levels in case (3), when H(l) does not remove the degeneracy and hence does not 
</p>
<p>give the proper or stabilized zeroth-order state vectors.] 
</p>
<p>If for some specific pair of levels, n and m, (E~O) - E~&raquo; is accidentally very 
</p>
<p>small (the case of an accidental near degeneracy), particularly if (m(O)/H(l)/n(O)} is 
</p>
<p>of the same order of magnitude as (E~O) - E~&raquo;, our perturbation theory formulae 
</p>
<p>would give a very poor approximation for this pair of levels. A technique that can 
</p>
<p>deal with this situation is the following: We shall make a unitary transformation on 
</p>
<p>the original perturbed Hamiltonian, H, to transform it to a new Hamiltonian, H', 
</p>
<p>to eliminate the off-diagonal matrix elements that connect the nearly degenerate 
</p>
<p>levels to all other levels, or at least make these off-diagonal matrix elements small 
</p>
<p>enough in orders of powers of A, so they will not contribute to the energies of states 
</p>
<p>nand m to some particular order in A. An elegant way to achieve this follows in 
</p>
<p>the next section. 
</p>
<p>A Perturbation Theory by Similarity Transformation 
</p>
<p>We shall try to find a unitary operator, D, generated by a hermitian operator, G, 
</p>
<p>such that H is transformed into H' 
</p>
<p>with U = eiJ.&middot;G, (1) 
</p>
<p>where the parameter, A, in U is the parameter of smallness in the perturbation

<p>232 24. The Case of Nearly Degenerate Levels

<p>This result is quite general. Note: If the two levels nand m are not nearly degenerate, 
</p>
<p>the result applies for a single level, say, the nth one, and in that case, we have simply 
</p>
<p>regained the result of nondegenerate-Ievel perturbation theory. The result also 
</p>
<p>applies to a pair of exactly degenerate levels. In that case, with E~~;' = E~O) = E~~),

</p>
<p>the proper zeroth-order state vectors. Finally, the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix 
</p>
<p>elements given by eq. (12) can be used in the case in which the degeneracy or near 
</p>
<p>degeneracy is greater than two-fold. 
</p>

<p>Magnetic Field Perturbations 
</p>
<p>So far, we have looked at a number of perturbation problems involving an external 
</p>
<p>electric field, i. We would like to look at similar problems involving external 
magnetic fields. 
</p>
<p>A The Quantum Mechanics of a Free, Charged Particle 
</p>
<p>in a Magnetic Field 
</p>
<p>Classically, the ,!Iamiltonian of a charged particle, o} char~e e and pass m, in a 
</p>
<p>magnetic field, B, derivable from a vector potential, A, via B = curIA, is given by

H = -(p - -A)&middot; (p - -A). 
</p>
<p>2m c c

</p>
<p>In a uniform field, Eo, e.g., with A = ~[Eo x r], the classical equations of motion 
in Hamiltonian formalism lead to 
</p>
<p>(2) 
</p>
<p>The SchrOdinger equation follows from eq. (1) via p --+ 1 V. At first glance, this 
equation seems to be dependent on the choice of gauge of the vector potential. 
</p>
<p>[With the choice of the so-called symmetric gauge for an electron in a uniform 
</p>
<p>magnetic field in the z-direction, see eq. (15) below.] If A gives rise to a magnetic 
induction E, a vector potential A' with A' = A + V I, where f is any function 
I(x, y, z), will give rise to the same field E. To keep the Schr6dinger equation </p>

<p>236 25. Magnetic Field Perturbations 
</p>
<p>form invariant to this gauge transformation, we must gauge not only A, but the 
Schrodinger wave function as well. The quantum-mechanical form of eq. (1) is 
</p>
<p>form invariant under the gauge transformation (see problem 3), 
</p>
<p>A 4 A' = A + V f(x, y, z), 
1/1 4 1/1' = 1/Ie lfcf (x. y.z). 
</p>
<p>B Aharanov-Bohm Effect 
</p>
<p>(3) 
</p>
<p>The above gauge transformation was exploited by Bohm and Aharanov in a famous 
</p>
<p>paper (phys. Rev. 115 (1959) 485) to show that the quantum-mechanical wave 
</p>
<p>function describing the motion of electrons can be influenced by the presence of 
</p>
<p>magnetic fields, even if the electron trajectories are such that the electrons do not 
</p>
<p>experience the Lorentz force ~ [v x ih if the trajectories are limited to regions in 
which B = O. They proposed the following experiment: An electron beam from 
an electron source is split into two identical beams, subsequently reflected from 
</p>
<p>identical reflectors to end in a detector, as shown in Fig. 25.1. If the electrons 
</p>
<p>in beam I are described by the wave function 1/11 and the electrons in beam 2 are 
described by the wave function 1/12, the number of electrons arriving at the common 
detector will be proportional to 11/11 + 1/1212. Bohm and Aharanov proposed to place 
a tightly wound, infinitely long solenoid of small radius, a, behind the screen. A 
</p>
<p>magnetic field Bo exists inside the solenoid, parallel to the solenoid axis, but the 
field outside the solenoid is precisely zero. The electrons therefore traverse only 
</p>
<p>regions of space where the B field is precisely zero. (Of course, this infinitely 
long, tightly wound solenoid is a "theorist's" solenoid, but it can be approximated 
</p>
<p>very well in the actual experiment.) Because the electrons are always in regions of 
</p>
<p>zero field, choose a gauge in which the vector potential A' is also zero outside the 
solenoid; i.e., choose a gauge for which 
</p>
<p>A' = 0 = A + V f(x, y, z) 
1/1' = 1/Ie ifc f(x.y.z). (4) 
</p>
<p>Therefore, taking a line integral of A' around the exterior contour shown in Fig. 
25.1, 
</p>
<p>o = f ;.. dl + f V f . dl 
= t rdr (lr d&cent;[V x A] . n + (2H af(r, e, &cent;) rd&cent; 
</p>

= Bona2 + (f(r, e, &cent; = 2n) - fer, e, &cent; = 0&raquo;), (5) 
</p>
<p>where we have converted the first line integral to a surface integral via Stokes's 
</p>
<p>theorem. The unit vector ii is parallel to the solenoid axis. The above therefore 
leads to

<p>Solution for Problem 34 
</p>
<p>The Schrodinger equation in the dimensionless quantities, E = E/(!i2/21e) and 
</p>
<p>A = VO/(!i2/21e), has the simple form 
</p>
<p>- (O~f + OO;~) 1jr(&cent;I, &cent;2) + A COS(&cent;I - &cent;Z)1jr(&cent;I' &cent;2) = E1jr(&cent;I, &cent;2), (1) 
</p>
<p>with zeroth-order solutions 
</p>
<p>1jr(0)(&cent;1, &cent;Z) = 2~ eim1&cent;1 eim2&cent;&gt; , with E(O) = (mf + m~). (2) 
</p>
<p>The needed matrix elements of H(l) = COS(&cent;I - &cent;2) are extremely simple in this 
</p>
<p>basis. The only nonzero matrix elements are 
</p>
<p>(ml + 1)(m2 - 1)IH(l)lmlm2) = ~, 
(ml - 1)(m2 + 1)IH(I)lmlm2) = ~. (3) 
</p>
<p>All other matrix elements are zero. Note: H(l) is diagonal in the quantum number 
</p>
<p>M = (ml +m2), so this quantum number is conserved to all orders of the perturba-
</p>
<p>tion. We list in the table below the possible quantum numbers ml, m2, M, as well 
</p>
<p>as the perturbation type and the total degeneracy number, g., for all states with 
</p>
<p>E(O) ::: 5. Degeneracies of 4 and 8 are common to most of the E(O) for this problem. 
</p>
<p>Because H(l), however, does not connect states of different total M, most of the 
</p>
<p>states of this system are effectively doubly degenerate or nondegenerate. 
</p>
<p>Among the states with a single m I, m2 -combination for a fixed M are the states 
</p>
<p>with E(O) = 2 and M = +2, or M = -2, as well as the ground state. Also, a </p>

<p>double action with H(l) on a state Imlm2) can convert it only to states with

</p>
<p>Therefore, states such as the pair of states with 1'(0) = 5, M = + 1, with m 1, .'112 = 
+2, -1, or -1, +2, with /',.ml, /',m2 = -3, +3, are unconnected through second 
order and can thus effectively be treated as if they were nondegenerate (if only 
</p>
<p>corrections through second order are significant). These states arc therefore listed 
</p>
<p>as belonging to type (1), using the characterization of degenerate states given in 
</p>
<p>Chapter 23. For type (1) states, the m I, ml basis is effectively the proper basis, 
and the states can be treated as if they were nondegenerate.

<p>Doubly degenerate states with a /',ml, /',.m2 = &plusmn;1, =fl, conversely, have their

</p>
<p>tors to carry forward the higher order perturbations. Such states are characterized 
</p>
<p>as type (2) according to the catalog of Chapter 23. 
Finally, doubly degenerate states with a /',.m I, /).m2 of 1:2, :r2 have their degen-
</p>
<p>eracy removed only in second order. Such states are best treated by transforming 
</p>
<p>the 2 x 2 Hamiltonian matrix H into a new HI = U llU;&middot;, as in Chapter 24 [see, 
in particular, eq. (12) of Chapter 24]. These are states characterized as type (3) in 
</p>
<p>Chapter 23. 
For states of type (1), we get the second-order corrections, 1'(2), via

</p>
<p>E(2) = ~C5 ~ 13) + (5 ~ 1&raquo;) = +i2. 
For states of type (2), we first diagonalize H( 1) . For example, for the states with

<p>Alternative Method: Symmetry-Adapted Eigenfunctions 
</p>
<p>Although the diagonalization of the H' matrices is extremely simple, the ques-
</p>
<p>tion arises: Is there a simpler way of discovering the proper linear combination of 
</p>
<p>zeroth-order state vectors that would automatically reduce the problem to nonde-
</p>
<p>generate perturbation theory. In general, degeneracies (unless "accidental") arise 
</p>
<p>because of some underlying symmetry. Sometimes, of course, this symmetry may 
</p>
<p>be very sophisticated and not so easy to discover. Therefore, if we have used 
</p>
<p>the wrong coordinates for our Schrodinger equation (which are not "symmetry 
</p>
<p>adapted"), we may have missed some of the simplicity of the problem. Conversely, 
</p>
<p>if we start with symmetry-adapted or proper zeroth-order wave functions or state 
</p>
<p>vectors, the perturbation problem may be reduced to nondegenerate perturbation 
</p>
<p>theory, in spite of the degeneracies of the zeroth-order problem. In our simple 
</p>
<p>example, we have not at all made use of the fact that the perturbing potential is an 
</p>
<p>even function of the relative coordinate, (CPl - CP2). It will therefore be useful to 
</p>
<p>transform from the "single-particle" coordinates, CPI, CP2, to the relative coordinate 
</p>
<p>(CP! - cf&gt;z), and a "center of mass" coordinate, &lt;1&gt;, via the transformation 
</p>
<p>cP = (CPI - cf&gt;z), (6) 
</p>
<p>We have made the Jacobian of this transformation equal to one. In the new variables,

<p>The possible m values are

m = j, (j - I), (j - 2), ... , - j, (3) 
</p>
<p>where m is an additive quantum number 
</p>
<p>(4) 
</p>
<p>First, we need to find the possible j values for a given iI, h. We shall name the jl, 
h, such that j] ? h- To find the possible values of j, we simply count the number 
of occurences for each possible value of m. 
</p>
<p>The maximum possible m value is m = j1 + h, which can be made in only one 
way, with ml = j] and m2 ccc h. Hence, one j value must exist with j = j1 + h. 
</p>
<p>There are two ways of making m = (j1 + 12 - 1); either with ml = .it, m2 = 
(h - 1), or with ml = (j1 - 1), m2 = h. One linear combination of these two 
states will be the state with j = jl + h and m = Ch + 12 - I). The other linear 
combination of these two states must be a state with m = j = (jl + h - 1). Thus, 
one j value must exist with j = (jl + h - 1). 
</p>
<p>There are three ways of making states with m = (j1 + h - 2), viz., with 
m l, m2 = j1, (12 - 2), (jl - 1), (h ..... 1), or (jl - 2), h- One linear combination of 
these three states is needed to make the state with j = jl + 12 and m = (jl + h - 2). 
A second linear combination of these three states is needed to make the state with 
</p>
<p>j = (j1 + h&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot; 1) and m = (jl + h - 2). This leaves one linear combination 
to make a single state with m = j = Ol + h - 2), so one j value exists with 
j = (jl + h - 2). 
</p>
<p>This process can be continued for k ::S 212 (recall we chose jJ ? h), so that 
there are (k + 1) ways of making states with m = U + 12 - k). Of these, k linear 
combinations are needed to make the states with this m value, but with one of the 
</p>
<p>allowed j values with j &gt; (j1 + h - k), leaving but a single linear combination of 
these states with In = j = Ul + h - k), so a single j value exists with 01 + h - k). 
</p>
<p>This process quits with k = 2}z. For k ? 2h and m ? 0, there are only (2h + I) 
ways of making the m value m = til + h - k) with k ? 2.i2, and all (2h + 1) 
independent linear combinations of these states are needed to make the states with 
</p>
<p>j ? (jl - h), so no new j values arise, with j &lt; (jl - h). Finally, symmetry 
</p>
<p>exists between the positive and negative m values. 
</p>
<p>Thus, the possible j values are 
</p>
<p>(jl + 12), (jl + h - 1), Ul + 12 - 2), ... , IU1 ..... h)l, 
</p>

</p>
<p>A General Properties of Vector Coupling Coefficients 
</p>
<p>We shall need the transfonnation coefficients of the unitary transfonnation 
</p>
<p>IjlhJm} = L IJl m lhm2}(Jl m lhm2IJlhJm}, (6) 
ml,(m2) 
</p>
<p>where (JlmIiZm2IiIhJm) is the unitary transformation matrix, which could be 
</p>
<p>written as, 
</p>
<p>where the row label is given by mlmZ, and the column label is specified by Jm. 
</p>
<p>We sum over both ml and m2 in eq. (6), but m is fixed and because m = ml + m2, 
mz is determined by ml and m, so it gets "dragged along" in the sum. This is why 
</p>
<p>we have put mz in parentheses in the summation symbol. Because iI and h is 
common to both bases, the unitary transformation coefficient is often abbreviated 
</p>
<p>by 
</p>
<p>It is known as a "Clebsch-Gordan coefficient," or as a "Wigner coefficient," or as 
</p>
<p>a "vector coupling coefficient." Slightly different notations are used by different 
</p>
<p>people. Other commonly used notations are ~jl 12m I m21j m} (note the different 
</p>
<p>order of the labels in the left-hand side), or C~'/~m, or several others. 
</p>
<p>The inverse of the above transfonnation, eq. (6), is in Dirac notation 
</p>
<p>liI mlhm2} = LliIhjm}(JlhJmliImlhm2}, (7) 
j 
</p>
<p>where the summation is one over J only, because m is fixed by the fixed values of 
mlandm2and 
</p>
<p>(JlhJmljlmlhm2) = (U- I )jm.mlm2 = (Um ,m2.jm)* 
= (JlmIi2m2IJlhJm)* = (JlmIi2mzIJm)*. (8) 
</p>
<p>The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can all be made real. (This is the "world" standard 
</p>
<p>to which everyone adheres!) Therefore, the complex conjugate sign is not needed 
</p>
<p>for the inverse transfonnation, and we can write the inverse transfonnation, in 
</p>
<p>terms of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient notation, as 
</p>
<p>Ijlmlhm2} = LljlhJm)(J\m\hm2IJm}. (9)

</p>
<p>(From the point of view of the Dirac notation, the transformation coefficient appears 
</p>
<p>to have bra and ket inverted. This inversion is because we have made use of the 
</p>
<p>unitary property of this real transformation coefficient. We shall always write

<p>the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient in the Dirac-like notation, but with the mJ, m2 </p>

<p>~or h = ~, we have already found one method: diagonalize the operator (it . 
h) in the Utmlhm2) basis. For h 2: 1, however, this method would lead to 
</p>
<p>a diagonalization of 3 x 3, 4 x 4, ... , matrices. Hence, we shall look for better 
</p>
<p>methods. One of these methods involves recursion formulae for the Clebsch-

<p>Gordan coefficients. We shall derive a recursion formula for the Clebsch-Gordan 
</p>
<p>coefficients by acting on the state vector Ijthjm) with the operator,

<p>Now, expanding I jl hj (m + 1&raquo;) on the left -hand side of this relation, and renaming 
the dummy summation indices m;, m; = (ml -1), m2 in the firsttermofthe right-

</p>
<p>Now, with left-multiplication by a (jtmthm21 with a specific, fixed mt and m2, 
</p>
<p>this equation is converted to the recursion relation, as follows.

</p>
<p>Now we need to calculate coefficients with m &lt; j. We can accomplish this by 
</p>
<p>deriving a recursion formula that steps down in m. By repeating the steps of eqs. 
</p>
<p>(11)-(14) by acting on the coupled state Ijli2jm) with the step-down operator 
</p>
<p>L = (11)- + (lz)-, we arrive at the analogue of eq. (14) as follows. 
</p>
<p>Recursion Formula II: 
</p>
<p>J(j + m)(j - m + l)(jlmli2m2U(m - I)} 
= J(jl - ml)(jl + ml + 1)(jl(ml + 1)hm2Ijm} 
+ J(h - m2)(h + m2 + l)(jlmlh(m2 + 1)ljm}. (21) 
</p>
<p>Repeated application of this recursion formula II will give us the coefficients with 
</p>
<p>arbitrary m, starting with the known coefficient with m = j. In practice, the most 
</p>
<p>widely used tables are those in which one of the angular momenta is reasonably

<p>small, say, h = !. I, ~,2. (See problem 39.) To calculate some ofthese it will be

<p>Symmetry Properties of

</p>
<p>Clebsch-Gordan coefficients in which the three angular momenta, i" h, and 
i == 13, are reordered may be simply related to each other. The most trivial case 
involves the exchange of the order of the quantum numbers, ilml and 12m2. The 
state vector Ulmlhm2) is a direct product of two vectors involving separate sub-
spaces of the full Hilbert space, or in terms of the coordinate representation, the

<p>wave function 1/Ijlm, 1/Ij2m2 is a product of functions involving different variables. 
</p>
<p>For example, 1/Ij,ml might be a function of orbital variables and 1/Ihm 2 might be 
</p>
<p>a function of spin variables. Thus, the product of these two functions should not

<p>depend on the order in which we write the two functions. Therefore, when we ex-

</p>
<p>we can see that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient Ulmlhm2l13m3) must be related 
</p>
<p>to the coefficient (13m3h - m2Iilml). In particular, if we make the substitution 
</p>
<p>il m 1 # 13m3 and m2 ~ -m2 in recursion formula I (or II), we obtain recursion 
</p>
<p>formula II (or I), provided the transformed coefficients are related to the original

</p>
<p>we expect 
</p>
<p>where K (jj, h, h) is the m-independent overall factor. This factor can be

</p>
<p>where the ii-dependent phase l/J can be determined because the coefficients with 
both ml = il and m3 = 13 and hence m2 = 13 - il must both be positive, and 
hence l/J = il - 13. Thus, we get a second symmetry property 
</p>
<p>(7) 
</p>
<p>By combining this symmetry property with the first one, (I # 2) exchange, we

<p>get

</p>
<p>This process is a cyclic exchange of the type 123 ~ (-2)31. If we follow this 
</p>
<p>by the cyclic exchange (-2)31 ~ (-3)1(-2) and subsequently by the cyclic

<p>exchange (-3)1( -2) ~ (-1)(-2)(-3), we obtain

an even integer. (Either hand m3 are both integers or are both !-integers.) 
</p>
<p>We have now derived several symmetry properties, involving interchanges such

<p>as 123 --+ 213, or cyclic interchanges such as 123 --+ (-2)31, or changes of 
</p>

</p>
<p>altogether. These properties are much easier to remember by introducing the 3-j

<p>This 3-j symbol has the following symmetry properties: The 3-j symbol is in-

<p>the factor (-I)h + h+ h under either an odd permutation of columns or under the

<p>Although the symmetry properties are easier to remember in terms of the 3-j

<p>Invariance of Physical Systems Under 
</p>
<p>Rotations 
</p>
<p>Before going further with our study of angular momentum, it will be advantageous 
</p>
<p>to study the general behavior of physical systems under rotations in our 3-D space. 
</p>
<p>If a state vector which describes the state of a physical system is specified by 11/1), 
the state vector for the rotated system will be specified by 11/IrotJ = RI1/I). (We use 
the subscript, rot., in place of a prime, which is often used for the rotated state, 
</p>
<p>because primes are also often used on quantum labels.) The operator, R, is the 
</p>
<p>operator that rotates the system. Recall from the theory of translation operators, 
</p>
<p>two possible points of view exist for such operators: (1) The active point of view, 
</p>
<p>in which R is used to rotate the system. (2) The passive point of view, in which 
</p>
<p>the system is left unchanged and R is used to rotate the coordinate system (in the 
</p>
<p>opposite sense) to view the system from a rotated reference frame. We shall use 
</p>
<p>the active point of view in this chapter. 
</p>
<p>The operator R is a linear, unitary operator: 
</p>
<p>(1) 
</p>
<p>(2) 
</p>
<p>Also, note the following properties. 
</p>
<p>1. If 11/1) ~ 11/Irod = RI1/I), (3) 
</p>
<p>2. If Ix) = 011/1), then IXrot.) = Rlx) = RORT(RI1/I&raquo;, 
so Orot. = RORT&bull; (4) </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>274 29. Invariance of Physical Systems Under Rotations 
</p>
<p>If [R, 0] = 0, then Orot. = 0, and if 0 is hermitian, Orot. is hermitian. Also, if 
</p>
<p>(X 11/1) are observable amplitudes, then

</p>
<p>Matrix elements of operators are also invariant: 
</p>

</p>
<p>Relations among operators are preserved under rotations: 
</p>
<p>5. If [A, B] = iC, then [Arot., Brod = iCrot.. (7) 
</p>
<p>A Rotation Operators 
</p>
<p>We shall begin by studying a single-particle system and assume for the moment 
</p>
<p>that the particle has no spin. We shall construct the rotation operator for a rotation 
</p>
<p>through an angle, a, about a specific axis. We shall also take the z axis of our 
coordinate system along the direction of the rotation axis. Then, in analogy with 
</p>
<p>the translation operator, T = e-kcIP&lt;, we shall try 
</p>
<p>(8) 
</p>
<p>where we have converted the physical angular momentum operator (z component) 
</p>
<p>into the dimensionless L z in the last step. To study the action of Rz(a) on a general 
</p>
<p>11/I}, expand 11/I} in terms of angular momentum eigenfunctions. 
</p>
<p>Then, 
</p>
<p>Thus, 
</p>
<p>11/1) = "2)nlm) (nlmI1/l) or

</p>
<p>1/Irot.(r, 8, CP) = 1/I(r, 8, CProrJ = 1{r(r, e, cP - a). (11) 
</p>
<p>We see (Fig. 29.1), if the original1{r(r, (), cp) has a maximum at some angle cP = &lt;Po, 
the rotated wave function, 1{rrot., has a maximum where (CP - a) = CPo, that is, where 
cP = CPo + a. In other words, the physical system has been rotated in the positive 
sense through an angle a. Note: The prime is often used to designate CProt., i.e., 
</p>
<p>CProt. == cpt = (CP - a), and note the last minus sign. </p>

<p>or 
</p>
<p>(15)

<p>leading to

<p>because Rs commutes with az. Similarly,

<p>or 
</p>
<p>(19) 
</p>
<p>and, similarly, 
</p>
<p>(20) 
</p>
<p>Thus, the rotation operator Rs(ex) rotates the iT vectorproperIy. Note: This iT vector 
is part of the physical system. Finally, if we combine the orbital and spin operators, 
</p>
<p>we get 
</p>
<p>(21) 
</p>
<p>for a single particle with spin. The generator of the rotation about an axis is the 
</p>
<p>component of the total angular momentum operator along that axis. This result 
</p>
<p>holds equally well for a many-particle system or any general system, provided Jz 
</p>
<p>is the z component of the total angular momentum vector. 
</p>
<p>B General Rotations, R(a, fj, y) 
</p>
<p>The most general rotation will be parameterized by the three Euler angles, ex, f3, 
and y, and will be built from the three successive rotations as follows. 
</p>
<p>The first rotation through the angle ex about the original space-fixed z axis will 
take the (x, y, z) coordinate system to a rotated (Xl, Yh Zl) system, with Zl = z. 
</p>
<p>The second rotation through an angle f3 about the new Y1 axis will take the 
(xt. Y1, Z 1) coordinate system to a new (X2, yzzz) system, with Y2 = Y1. 
</p>
<p>The third rotation through an angle y about the Z2 axis will take the (X2, YZ, Z2) 
</p>
<p>coordinate system to the final rotated (x', y', 2') system, with z' = Z2. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>C Transformation of Angular Momentum Eigenvectors or Eigenfunctions 277 
</p>
<p>We shall think of the coordinate systems as being attached to our physical system. 
</p>
<p>Thus, the general rotation can be expressed through 
</p>
<p>(22) 
</p>
<p>where this is not a very handy form because the three generators of the unitary 
</p>
<p>transformations, R(a), R({3), and R(y), are expressed in terms of angular momen-
</p>
<p>tum components along three different coordinate systems. Using Orot. = RORT, 
</p>
<p>however, and noting the operator JY1 is reached from Jv via the rotation R(a), we 
</p>
<p>have 
</p>
<p>(23) 
</p>
<p>Similarly, noting the operator Jz' = JZ2 is reached from JZ1 via the rotation R({3), 
we have 
</p>
<p>(24) 
</p>
<p>Thus, we can write 
</p>
<p>R(a, {3, y) = R({3)e-iYJ'I R(/3)-1 R({3)e-iClJ, = R({3)e-iyJ" e-iClJ,. (25) 
</p>
<p>Now, noting JZ1 = Jz , the two rotation operators on the extreme right commute 
</p>
<p>with each other, and we can write 
</p>
<p>R(a, /3, y) = e-i{3J}1 R(a)e-iyJ, = R(a)e- i{3J} R(a)-l R(a)e-iyJ,. (26) 
</p>
<p>This process leads to the final result, 
</p>
<p>(27) 
</p>
<p>Now, all generators are expressed with respect to components along the original 
</p>
<p>axes, but seemingly the order of the rotations is "backwards," we start on the right 
</p>
<p>with the y rotation, followed by {3, and last the a-term. 
</p>
<p>C Transformation of Angular Momentum Eigenvectors 
</p>
<p>or Eigenfunctions 
</p>
<p>Having derived a useful expression for the most general rotation operator, we can 
</p>
<p>now give an expression for a rotated state vector that is an eigenvector of both 12 
</p>
<p>and Jz (and other operators commuting with these two), in terms of the original 
</p>
<p>eigenvectors of this type 
</p>
<p>I(JM)rotJ = R(a, {3, y)IJM) = L)hL)(JJLIR(a,{3,Y)IJM), (28) 
</p>
<p>/1 
</p>
<p>where, for simplicity of notation, we have omitted all quantum numbers other than 
</p>
<p>J and M (associated with the remaining operators). Also, the matrix elements 
</p>
<p>of operators, Jz and Jy are diagonal in the quantum number J. Thus, the J sum 
</p>
<p>disappears from the unit operator, LJ,/11 J JL) {J JLI. The rotation matrix is usually </p>

</p>
<p>because this rotation matrix is an irreducible representation matrix of the rotation 
</p>
<p>group SO(3) for integral angular momenta or the unitary group SU(2) for 1-
integral spins. 
</p>

</p>
<p>The * is added so the simple exponential factors have + signs; (but this notation is 
not universal!) 
</p>
<p>(30) 
</p>
<p>where 
</p>
<p>(31) 
</p>
<p>is a real function of f3, because the matrix elements of i ly are always real in the 
standard angular momentum conventions. (Therefore, no * was needed on the d 
function.) 
</p>
<p>We can also convert eq. (28) into an equation for angular-momentum 
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions 
</p>
<p>(71(1 M)rot.) = (1/!rotJJM(r, e, fiJ, a) = 1/!JM(r, e', fiJ', a') 
= "L1/!J/J.(r,e,fiJ,a)D~M(ct,f3,Y)*' (32) 
</p>
<p>/J. 
</p>
<p>where we have now used primed angles for the angles in the rotated angular 
</p>
<p>momentum eigenfunction. Recall e', fiJ' = e, (fiJ - ct) for the simple z rotation 
with f3 = 0, y = O. In general, e', fiJ' are complicated functions of e, fiJ, ct, f3, y. 
We can write the inverse of this transformation 
</p>
<p>1/!JM(r, e, fiJ, a) = L1/!J/J.(r, e', fiJ', a')&laquo;D-l)~M)*' (33) 
/J. 
</p>
<p>Now, making use of the unitary property of the D matrix, 
</p>
<p>1/!JM(r, e, fiJ, a) = LD;{,/J.(ct, f3, y)1/!J/J.(r, e', fiJ', a'). (34) 
/J. 
</p>
<p>The job of calculating the d:M (f3) of eq. (31) remains. For the smallest 1 values, 
this process is quite straightforward. For example, for 1 = 1, with

<p>D General Expression for the Rotation Matrices 
</p>
<p>Although we know the matrix elements of Jy = -4(h - L), the calculation of

</p>
<p>noncommutability of the operators J + and L. The calculation of the d matrix

<p>would be straightforward if we could restructure the rotation operator in the fonn,

</p>
<p>fonn eC , where A and Bare noncommuting operators (or their matrix realizations)

</p>
<p>where the ... involves triple and quadruple and ever higher commutators of the

<p>operators A and B. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is very useful in 
</p>
<p>cases in which the multiple commutators are all zero, say, after the second or third

<p>one, with ever more complicated coefficients. The desired final result, however, 
</p>
<p>depends only on the angular momentum commutator algebra. The coefficients,

not on the quantum number, I. It will therefore be sufficient to use the simplest

<p>Coherent States

<p>state vectors 11/1) of our 3-D world in terms of functions of the complex variables, 
a and z, where these complex numbers are related to the orientation of the physical 
system in our 3-D world. We are now in a position to see the relationship between 
</p>
<p>these type I and type II coherent states. Such angular coherent states will again be 
</p>
<p>very useful for physical systems best described through a statistical distribution of 
</p>
<p>states with different orientations in our laboratory. 
</p>
<p>The type I coherent state was defined through 
</p>
<p>la) = e(X'J+-aJ-IJ, M = -J) = e-ie(].;;)IJ, M = -J), (59) 
</p>
<p>where the complex variable, a, is related to the angles e, cp through a = -(e /2)e i&cent;, 
so the unit vector, ii, lies in the x, y -plane and is rotated forward from the laboratory 
y axis through an angle cpo The coherent state la) can thus be expressed through a 
rotation operator, with Euler angles, cp, e, and y = 0: 
</p>
<p>la) == la(e, &cent;&raquo; = R(&cent;, e, O)IJ, M = -J). 
</p>
<p>We can therefore expand the type I angular coherent state through

<p>Because the parity of the spherical hannonics, Ylm , is given by (-1 i, operators

<p>In terms of the polar and azimuth angles, e, &cent;, the space inversion operation can

<p>Spherical Tensor Operators 
</p>
<p>From the previous discussion, it is clear it would be advantageous to give vectors, 
</p>
<p>such as r, not in Cartesian component, but in spherical component form. Recalling 
</p>
<p>( rrY~:I) = If x (- ~;:!::e+i&cent;) = If x (- ~(~ +iY&raquo;), 
rYI_ 1 4rr + ~r sinOe- i&cent; 4rr + ~(x - iy) 
</p>
<p>it will be useful to write the vector r in terms of the spherical components 
(r +1, ro, r -I), with 
</p>
<p>r+1 = - ~(x + iy), ro = z, r_1 = + jz(x - iy). (1) 
</p>
<p>Note,inparticular,thedifferencesbetweenr+1 andr+ = (x+iy),andr_1 andr_ = 
</p>
<p>(x - iy). Before generalizing this vector result to higher rank tensor components 
</p>
<p>in spherical form, let us look at second rank tensors, T;j, in Cartesian component 
</p>
<p>form. Write the general second rank tensor in terms of a symmetric, traceless part, 
</p>
<p>Sij, an anti symmetric part, Aij, and the trace La Taa.

<p>will split into three submatrices. The five independent components of the traceless, 
</p>
<p>symmetric tensor, Sij, transform only among themselves. The three components 
</p>
<p>of the antisymmmetric tensor, A;j, will transform only among themselves, and 
</p>
<p>the trace of the tensor is a rotationally invariant quantity. The five independent 
</p>
<p>components of Sij transform like the five components of a spherical harmonic, 
</p>
<p>Y2m. The three components of AU transform like the three components of a vector. 
</p>
<p>We can see this at once if we build the tensor Ti j from two vectors (x, y, z) and 
</p>
<p>(X, Y, Z), with Al2 = (xY - yX), All = (zX - xZ), and A23 = (yZ - zY), 
where these are the z, y, and x components of the vector product -; x R. The trace 
of the tensor transforms like the spherical harmonic foo. We have thus succeeded 
</p>
<p>in finding second rank tensor components that transform like spherical harmonics, 
</p>
<p>with I = 2, 1, and O. As we go to higher rank tensors, this type of decomposition 
will become more difficult. For example, the 27 components of a third rank tensor 
</p>
<p>will have 10 totally symmetric components. These components could be split 
</p>
<p>further into seven components that transform like spherical harmonics, with I = 3, 
and three components that transform like the three components of a spherical 
</p>
<p>harmonic, with I = 1. A single, totally antisymmetric tensor component exists, 
which is rotationally invariant; i.e., it transforms like a foo. The 16 remaining 
</p>
<p>components of mixed symmetry could be split into two sets of five components 
</p>
<p>that transform like spherical harmonics with I = 2 and two sets of three components 
</p>
<p>that transform like spherical harmonics, with I = 1.

<p>A Definition: Spherical Tensors 
</p>
<p>The set of e2k + 1) components of a spherical tensor Tqk with q = +k, (k -

<p>The components of a spherical tensor can also be defined through their commutator

<p>dependent of the quantum numbers M, q, M'. The dependence on M, q, M' sits 
</p>
<p>solely in the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The factor F(a, I, k, a', ]') is usually

</p>
<p>Because the properties of the system cannot depend on the orientation of the

<p>tensor of rank I = O. The energies will be independent of the quantum number M. 
The (2J + I)-fold degeneracy of the energy levels can be removed only through 
the action of external perturbations. More important for calculational purposes, 
</p>
<p>we can choose any convenient M, such as M = J, to calculate the energies of the 
</p>
<p>isolated (unperturbed) system. 
</p>
<p>We now briefly give a few double-barred matrix elements of some simple op-
</p>
<p>erators. The "extra" ,J(2l' + 1) factor, part of the definition of the double barred 
matrix element, leads to the fact that the reduced matrix element of the simple unit

<p>Nuclear Hyperfine Structure in 
</p>
<p>One-Electron Atoms 
</p>
<p>We shall use the magnetic nuclear hyperfine structure calculation in one-electron 
</p>
<p>atoms to illustrate how the Wigner-Eckart theorem can be exploited in actual 
</p>
<p>calculations. So far, we have calculated the perturbed one-electron spectrum (in 
</p>
<p>hydrogen or in alkali atoms) only under the assumption the nucleus (the proton in 
</p>
<p>hydrogen or the alkali atomic nucleus) have a charge but no magnetic properties. 
</p>
<p>Because the proton has a spin (with spin quantum number !), it also has a magnetic 
moment, similarly for alkali atoms. The spin of the stable isotope of Na, e.g., is 
</p>
<p>~, and hence, it also has a nuclear magnetic moment. These nuclear magnetic 
</p>
<p>moments will have a magnetic interaction with the spin magnetic moment of the 
</p>
<p>electron. In addition, the motion of the electron relative to the nucleus will set 
</p>
<p>up an effective magnetic field at the nucleus (proportional to the orbital angular 
</p>
<p>momentum of the electron). The magnetic moment of the nucleus will also lead to a 
</p>
<p>_(ji,magn .. ii) magnetic interaction caused by this field. These magnetic interactions 
of nuclear origin will give rise to the so-called hyperfine structure splitting of the 
</p>
<p>nlsj states of the one-electron atoms. If we call the electron magnetic moment ji,s 
and the nuclear magnetic moment ji, I,

<p>where we use the vector, i, for the nuclear spin operator, with quantum number, /, 
e.g., / = t for the proton, / = ~ for 23Na. Also, m is the electron mass, whereas 
M is the proton mass. (Even in the Na nucleus, the magnetic moment is caused 
</p>
<p>by the last odd valence proton in the nucleus, so it is the proton mass in the so-
</p>
<p>called nuclear magneton, i~c' which gives a natural measure for nuclear magnetic 
moments.) The g factor for the nuclear magnetic moment is not simply equal to </p>

</p>
<p>understood in terms of the quark structure of the nucleon. 
</p>
<p>The magnet-magnet interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron

</p>
<p>including the delta-function term that comes into play only if the two magnets can 
</p>
<p>be on top of each other. This so-called contact term, (part of classical electrody-
</p>
<p>namics according to J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, New York: John 
</p>
<p>Wiley, 1967), comes into play only in atomic s-states, I = 0 states, where the elec-
tron has a finite probability of sitting "on" the nucleus. The additional-eMf . Heff.)

</p>
<p>caused by the effective magnetic field of the moving electron at the nucleus, leads 
</p>
<p>to an additional interaction term 
</p>
<p>(4) 
</p>
<p>In these relations, the quantity r is r phys. = aor, where the last r is our usual dimen-

</p>
<p>give

<p>where the dot in the last form stands for the generalized scalar product of two 
</p>

</p>
<p>sometimes called a "tensor" interaction, but the term is somewhat of a misnomer. 
</p>
<p>The full interaction is a scalar, a rotationally invariant k = 0 spherical tensor, but 
</p>
<p>the term "tensor" is used because it involves the scalar product of two spherical 
</p>
<p>tensors each of spherical rank 2. Because we want to calculate matrix elements

basis, rather than a 
</p>

</p>
<p>basis, we need to tailor the magnet-magnet interaction to the coupling scheme of 
</p>
<p>eq. (12), where f and s are coupled to resultant J, which is then coupled to the 
nuclear spin i to resultant total angular momentum F. The form of eq. (11) is 
tailored more to the coupling scheme of eq. (13), where the electron spin, S, and 
the nuclear spin, i, are coupled to total spin S, which is then coupled with f to 
resultant total angular momentum F. By rearranging the order of the couplings, 
we can also express the magnet-magnet interaction through

</p>

quantum numbers F = 2 and F = 1. Because the contact tenn, with the delta 
</p>
<p>function, can contribute only in s states, with I = O. for which the electron has a 
nonzero probability of being on the proton, this tenn cannot contribute to the p-
</p>

</p>
<p>We shall now exploit the Wigner-Eckart theorem in two ways: (1) Because 
</p>
<p>Hint. is a k = 0 scalar operator, it will be sufficient to calculate the diagonal matrix 
</p>
<p>element of this interaction for states with M F = F. (2) In addition. the calculation 
can be reduced to a calculation of the reduced or double-barred matrix elements 
</p>
<p>of the two operators, [y2 x Sl]! and l~, in the In[1 x s]jmj} basis. The needed 
</p>
<p>matrix elements of Id are very simple and can then be combined with these after 
application of the Wigner-Eckart theorem. To calculate the double-barred matrix

<p>"clever" choice of m j = + ~ in the full matrix element. In the above, we have

</p>
<p>Although the calculation of this reduced matrix element in the state with j = (l + ~ ) 
was extremely trivial, we note an alternative method that might be useful for states 
</p>
<p>with j = (I - ~) or for states with s &gt; ~ and several possible j values. From eq. 
(9) of Chapter 32, we could also have written 
</p>
<p>([I x s]jlllll[l x s]j) = ([I x S]jlj~~. ~{~I[l x s]j)

<p>Angular Momentum Recoupling: 
Matrix Elements of Coupled Tensor 
Operators in an Angular Momentum 
Coupled Basis 
</p>
<p>In Chapter 33, we evaluated the matrix elements of a vector-coupled spherical 
</p>
<p>tensor of type [Uk, x Vk2]~ in terms of the reduced matrix elements of both U k, 
</p>
<p>and Vk2 in the appropriate angular momentum-coupled basis, 
</p>
<p>where we managed to simplify the calculation by judicious use of the Wigner-
</p>
<p>Eckart theorem and convenient choices of magnetic quantum numbers. In some 
</p>
<p>cases, however, the calculation still involved fairly tedious m sums of expressions 
</p>
<p>involving products of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. It is the purpose of this chapter 
</p>
<p>to show matrix elements of the above type can be expressed in terms of so-called 
</p>
<p>angular momentum recoupling coefficients. Because values of these recoupling 
</p>
<p>coefficients are available through tabulations or computer codes, and in many 
</p>
<p>cases through algebraic expressions, it will be valuable to study these recoupling 
</p>
<p>coefficients.

</p>
<p>For states involving three commuting angular momentum operators, we require 
</p>
<p>six angular momentum quantum numbers, hence, six commuting operators, e.g.,

</p>
<p>As for the case of two angular momenta, it will often be advantageous to use a basis 
</p>
<p>with good total angular momentum in which ]2 is diagonal. Now, however, the five 
commuting operators 112, Il, H, ]2, and i z = h + he +.h will be insufficient. 
A sixth operator is needed. To find this sixth operator, we could couple to total]

<p>the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The rather strange order of the angular momentum

<p>quantum numbers is that first introduced by Racah through his W coefficient, 
</p>
<p>related to the above V coefficient via

<p>V(jlhJiJ; J12 lz3) = ./(2J12 + 1)(2h3 + I)W(jlhJh; J12lz3). (4)

<p>Finally, we have indicated this unitary transformation could be expressed through 
</p>
<p>the elements of a matrix with row index J 12 and column index J23 , where the 
</p>
<p>matrix elements are functions of the quantum numbers jl, h, J, h, common to 
both bases. The unitary character of the transformation gives us 
</p>
<p>(5) 
</p>
<p>Because the V coefficients can be expressed in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coef-
</p>
<p>ficients, which are real, the V coefficients are real, so the * has been omitted in 
the last step, and the inverse matrix is given by the transposed matrix, V-I = u. 
Therefore, 
</p>
<p>I [Mhhl J23]J M) = LVJ;31jI21[UlhlJ12h]J M)

</p>
<p>Because the signs of angular momentum-coupled functions depend on the order 
</p>
<p>of the couplings, it is important to keep the order of the various couplings, as 
</p>
<p>indicated by the order of the angular momentum couplings inside the [ 1 brackets. 
For this purpose a pictorial representation of eqs. (2) and (6) is also useful. See Figs. 
</p>
<p>34.2(a) and (b), where the arrow also helps to indicate the order of the couplings.

<p>See also Figs. 34.l(a) and (b) for a pictorial representation of the coupling of two

</p>
<p>By expanding the angular momentum coupled states of eqs. (2) and (6) in terms of

<p>All three relations, eqs. (9), (12), and (14) may be useful in the evaluation of U

<p>coefficients. 
</p>
<p>As a very simple example, let us evaluate the U coefficients for the case 
</p>
<p>j] = I, h = !, j3 = !. This recoupling coefficient might be needed in 
two-electron configurations in which one electron has arbitrary orbital angular 
</p>
<p>momentum, I, whereas the second electron is an s electron with I = O. Here, a 
U coefficient is needed in the transformation from LS to}} coupling and has the 
</p>
<p>fomi U (l! J ~; j S), where S is the total two-electron spin and J is the total angu-
lar momentum quantum number. Here, J can have the values I + 1, I, and I - 1. 
With J = I + 1, however, S is fixed uniquely at S = I, and j is fixed uniquely 
at j = (l + &amp;). The U transformation matrix is a 1 x 1 matrix. For any 1 x I 
transformation, the U coefficient has the value + 1. Thus, 
</p>
<p>U (l &amp; (I + 1) &amp;; (l + &amp;) 1) = + 1. (15) 
</p>
<p>Similarly, 
</p>
<p>UCl!U - l)~; (l- ~)l) = +1. (16) 
</p>
<p>When j = l, however, 8 has the two possible values, 8 = 0, 1, and j has the two 
possible values j = (I + ~), (l - ~). In this case, the U transformation matrix is 
a 2 x 2 matrix. With the simple table of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of Chapter 
</p>

<p>C Alternate Fonns for the Recoupling Coefficients for

<p>Three Angular Momenta

<p>The recoupling coefficients for three commuting angular momentum operators 
</p>
<p>were first introduced by Racah through his W coefficient. The relation between 
</p>
<p>the Racah W coefficient and the unitary U coefficient has been given in eq. (4). 
</p>
<p>Because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are subject to 2 x 3! symmetry relations 
</p>
<p>most easily expressed via the 3-j symbol (see Chapter 28) there will of course be 
</p>
<p>similar symmetry relations for the U coefficients. To see the symmetry relations 
</p>
<p>most easH y, without factors of ,J (21 + 1) or complicated phase factors, it is useful </p>

<p>to introduce the so-called 6-j coefficient or 6-j symbol, conventionally written 
</p>
<p>between curly brackets in two rows, 
</p>
<p>1 ~~~}. 
(18) 
</p>
<p>The 6-j symbol must satisfy four angular momentum addition triangle relations: 
</p>
<p>The three angular momenta in the first row must satisfy an angular momentum 
</p>
<p>addition triangle relation. Any angular momentum quantum number from the first 
</p>
<p>row satisfies such a triangle relation with two partners from the second row, which 
</p>
<p>must lie in columns different from the column of the symbol in the first row. The 
</p>
<p>6-j symbol is invariant under the following symmetry transformations: 
</p>
<p>(1) The 6-j symbol is invariant under any permutation of columns (Le., six 
</p>
<p>symmetry operations). 
</p>
<p>(2) The 6-j symbol is invariant under an exchange of the j's in rows 1 and 2 for 
</p>
<p>any two columns: 
</p>
<p>In actual calculations, the unitary form of the recoupling coefficients is often 
</p>
<p>the most useful. In order to make use of its symmetry properties, however, it 
</p>
<p>is clearly advantageous to convert it to 6-j form first. As a simple application of 
</p>
<p>such symmetry properties, let us evaluate the V coefficient in which the quantum 
</p>
<p>number, lz3 = 0, and therefore 1 = jl, and h = h- If one of the labels, j!, h h, 
or 1, has the value zero, the V matrix is a 1 x 1 matrix and the V coefficient has 
</p>
<p>the value + 1. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>V(jlhjlh; 1120) = J(2112 + 1)(_1)2j,+2h {~! h 1012} 
J2 j! 
</p>

<p>To illustrate the usefulness of the recoupling coefficients of Racah type, let us 
</p>
<p>calculate the matrix element of a scalar operator of type 
</p>
<p>(Uk(l). Vk(2&raquo; = L(-l)qU:(1)V~qC2) (23) 
q 
</p>
<p>in a 1[J1h]JM} basis, where U;(l) are spherical tensors of rank k built from 
</p>
<p>operators acting in the space of variables of type (I) == ('1, iT1 , &bull;&bull;&bull; ), similarly 
for V~q(2) and space (2) and where the vectors IJ1md are angular momentum 
eigenvectors for the subspace (1), similarly for Ihm2} and space (2). That is, we 
</p>
<p>want to calculate matrix elements of type 
</p>
<p>(U{J~]J MI(Uk(I). Vk (2&raquo;IUIi2]J M}. 
</p>
<p>These are matrix elements of the type met in Chapter 33. For simplicity, we have 
</p>
<p>left off additional quantum numbers that may be needed for a full specification of 
</p>
<p>the states in question. Expanding the angular momentum coupled states in ket and 
</p>
<p>bra and using the Wigner-Eckart theorem to express the matrix elements of U;(l) 
</p>
<p>and V ~q (2) in terms of their reduced matrix elements, we have 
</p>
<p>(U{J~]J MICUkCI). Vk(2&raquo;I[Jlh]J M} = 
L L L (jlmlhm2IJM}(j{m;J~m;IJM}(jlmlkqIJ;m;)

J(2J; + I) 12 2 q h 2 J(2J~ + 1) 
</p>
<p>(24) 
</p>
<p>Now, let us use a symmetry property of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to 
</p>
<p>reexpress 
</p>
<p>The above matrix element then can be rewritten as 
</p>
<p>([ ., .']J MICUk(l) . V k (2&raquo;I[&middot; .]J M} = (_I)k (j; IIUk(l)IIJI) (j~11 V k (2)llh)

</p>
<p>q m,(m2)m',(m;) 
</p>
<p>x (jlmlhm2lJ M)(kqj~m;lhm2}. (26) 
</p>
<p>Comparing the sum over q, m 1, m; of the product of the four Clebsch-Gordan co-
efficients in the last lines with eq. (9), the identification of the six angular momenta 
</p>
<p>in these Clebsch-Gordan coefficients with those of eq. (9) yields

<p>G Nuclear Hyperfine Interaction in a One-Electron Atom Revisited 329 
</p>
<p>G An Application: The Nuclear Hyperfine Interaction 
</p>
<p>in a One-Electron Atom Revisited 
</p>
<p>In Chapter 33, we calculated the nuclear hyperfine interaction in a one-electron 
</p>
<p>atom with the use of a few Wigner coefficients by making judicious use of the 
</p>
<p>Wigner-Eckart theorem. In particular, we calculated the nuclear hyperfine splitting 
</p>
<p>of a one-electron P3/2 state, where our nucleus had a nuclear spin I = ~ as in 
hydrogen, and we also quoted the result for the partner PI/2 state. We can now 
</p>
<p>repeat this calculation in a much more general way by making full use of the 
</p>
<p>angular momentum recoupling machinery of this addendum. 
</p>
<p>The nuclear hyperfine interaction for a hydrogenic s -state, with I = 0, was given 
in Chapter 33 as 
</p>
<p>(45) 
</p>
<p>For a hydro genic state with l =I 0, conversely, it was shown to be 
</p>
<p>(46) 
</p>
<p>[see egs. (5) and (14) of Chapter 33]. If we define the needed hydrogenic integrals 
</p>
<p>via 
</p>
<p>then we have an effective hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian that can be written 
</p>
<p>[ ~ ~ ~ 2 11 I] fIh.f.int = f3h.f.s. (I&middot; 1)- .y 8n([Y x s I . I ) , 
</p>
<p>Hh f&middot; = f3' (s .j') for I = O. .. mt h.f.s. ' 
</p>
<p>for I =I 0; 
</p>
<p>(48) 
</p>
<p>An terms in these electron-nuclear spin interactions are of the form (Uk=1 (1) . 
Vk=1(2&raquo;, where the space (1) is that of the electron and includes both electron 
</p>
<p>orbital and electron spin variables, whereas the space (2) is that of the nuclear 
</p>
<p>intrinsic variables characterized by the nuclear spin vector, 1. We will of course 
need the coupling scheme r + s = J for the electron variables, and we will assume 
the fine structure splitting is much greater than the hyperfine structure splitting, so 
</p>
<p>j is a ~ood quantum number. Finally, we will c~)Uele e~ectro!;l J with the nuclear 
spin, I, to resultant total angular momentum, F: j + I = F. All of the needed 
mal.1ix elements are then given in terms of electron reduced matrix elements, the

</p>
<p>So far, we have not solved many perturbed Coulomb problems by conventional

</p>
<p>state of definite, n, to all other bound states, as well as to the full spectrum of 
</p>
<p>continuum states. The complete set of states includes both the bound states and 
</p>
<p>the continuum states. The unit operator in this conventional basis is given by

</p>
<p>Before introducing the operators of an SO(2,1) algebra, which will be used to 
</p>
<p>simplify the perturbation expansions for a perturbed Coulomb problem, let us 
</p>
<p>look first at the commutator algebra of the quantum-mechanical operators arising 
</p>
<p>from the known classical integrals for the Coulomb potential, the orbital angular 
</p>
<p>momentum vector, i, and the Runge-Lenz vector, n. It will be convenient to 
express all operators in dimensionless quantities through atomic units. Thus,

<p>It is useful to define the vector operators, M and N, through

</p>
<p>M = z(L + V), N = z(L - V), (15)

<p>where these operators satisfy the commutation relations of two commuting angular

</p>
<p>(17) 
</p>
<p>If the eigenvalues of the operators M2 and N2 are denoted by jl (jl + 1) and 
h(h + 1), respectively, these relations require 
</p>
<p>jl = h = ~(n - 1). (18) 
</p>
<p>These angular momentum quantum numbers can thus be integral or half-integral. 
</p>
<p>Two commuting angular momentum operators of this type generate II group wh~ch 
is a direct product of two SU(2) groups: SU(2) x SU(2). Because L = (M + N), 
and we want to construct states of good orbital angular momentum, we want to 
</p>
<p>use the vector-coupled basis I[h x jzllm) = I[~(n - 1) x ~(n - l)]lm), which 
</p>
<p>is an eigenvector simultaneously of &pound;2, Lo, and H, the latter with eigenvalue, 
E = -I/2n2 . The quantum number, n, also gives the eigenvalues of M2 and N2. 
Angular momentum vector coupling rules tell us the possible quantum numbers I

<p>range from 0, J, ... to (n-I). 
</p>
<p>To understand the significance of the vector V = (M - N), let us rewrite

<p>in terms of spherical coordinates, r, e, ifJ. It will be sufficient to choose one

<p>H Matrix Elements of the Vector Operators, rand r p, 
in the Stretched Basis 
</p>
<p>In the last example, all of the needed matrix elements involved merely matrix ele-
</p>
<p>ments of the 80(2,1) generators, 1;. For spherically nonsymmetric perturbations, 
however, we will encounter spherical tensors of higher rank that can change the 
</p>
<p>quantum numbers I and m. The basic operators, from which more complicated 
</p>
<p>ones can be built, are the vector operators, -; and p. So far, the only I step oper-
ators we have met are the components of the Runge-Lenz vector, which left the 
</p>
<p>principal quantum number, n, invariant. Conversely, the ladder operators, T&plusmn;, of 
</p>
<p>SO(2,1) could change only the n quantum number within a ladder of a definite l. 
</p>
<p>The general vector operator, such as -; and p, can change both n and I. 
Recall, first, the Runge-Lenz vector, in the foml of the vector, V, is given by 
</p>
<p>v = -I-~ .. ---[-;G(P' jJ)) - pCr. p) + r[i(p, p) ..... &middot;r&middot;~&middot;]J

<p>The reduced matrix elements of A in the stretched basis are therefore the same as 
the reduced matrix elements of V in the conventional basis.

</p>
<p>off-diagonal matrix elements for transitions between different bound states. An 
</p>
<p>example is the electric dipole moment matrix element between different hydrogen 
</p>
<p>bound states. In eq. (4), we used the matrix element of r cos e between a p-state

<p>K Final Remarks 
</p>
<p>As we have seen, the techniques introduced in this chapter are particularly useful for 
</p>
<p>spherically symmetric perturbations of the hydrogenic atom. For nonspherically 
</p>
<p>symmetric perturbations, the stretched hydro genic basis can be used to get second-
</p>
<p>order results, but the solution for the final eigenvalues and eigenvectors still requires 
</p>
<p>the diagonalization of some finite-dimensional matrices. For axially symmetric 
</p>
<p>perturbations, parabolic coordinates are more convenient. We have seen in problem 
</p>
<p>26 that stretched parabolic coordinates, fL, v, can be expressed in term of two 
</p>
<p>commuting SO(2, 1) groups with generators, T; and 7;'. The zeroth-order hydrogen 
problem is then transformed into an eigenvalue equation of the form

<p>The WKB Approximation 
</p>
<p>Although this perturbation technique (due to Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin) has 
</p>
<p>practical value essentially only for 1-D problems (or for problems separable into 
</p>
<p>one-dimensionalized problems), it is of considerable interest through its connection 
</p>
<p>with classical physics and the "old" (pre-1925) quantum theory. It is not only of 
</p>
<p>historical theoretical importance, however. It can be very useful for problems 
</p>
<p>involving quantum-mechanical tunneling. 
</p>
<p>For a one-dimensionalized Schrodinger equation, we have 
</p>
<p>d 2 u 2J.t 
dx 2 + fj2(E - V(x&raquo;u(x) = 0, (1) 
</p>
<p>or 
</p>
<p>d 2u p2(X) 
dx 2 + /i2u(x) = 0, (2) 
</p>
<p>where P(x) is the "local" (x-dependent) momentum of the particle. Thus if V(x) 
</p>
<p>were constant over a small range of x values, P would be the momentum of the 
</p>
<p>particle in this range of x values. The WKB technique uses Fi as an expansion 
</p>
<p>parameter; that is, it uses an expansion in powers of Fi that should therefore be 
</p>
<p>valid in the classicallimitFi --+ O. In particular, solutions are sought of the form

use the exact solution for this straight-line potential of fixed slope to fit onto the

</p>

<p>(16) 
</p>
<p>In the vibrational spectrum of the ammonia molecule, NH3 , one degree of freedom 
</p>
<p>exists, which corresponds to the motion of the N atom relative to the H3 symmetrical 
</p>
<p>triangle. This degree of freedom can be approximated by z, the distance of the N 
atom above (or below) the H3 plane. The potential, V(z), has the the symmetrical 
</p>
<p>double minimum form shown in Fig. 37" 1" Classically, the N atom would lie either 
</p>
<p>above the H3 plane and undergo a vertical oscillation about its upper equilibrium 
</p>
<p>configuration at Z = +ze, or alternately it might lie below the H3 plane and 
undergo an oscillation about its lower equilibrium configuration at z = -Ze' 
Quantum mechanically, of course, the N atom can tunnel from the upper minimum 
</p>
<p>to the lower one, leading to a doubling of the vibrational energy levels, with one 
</p>
<p>eigenfunction being an even function of z, the second an odd function of z. We 
have already seen the energy splitting, !\E, is related to the frequency with which 
</p>
<p>the N atom tunnels back and forth from one minimum to the other. The reduced 
</p>
<p>mass for this degree offreedom is 3m H m N / (3m H+ m N ). 
</p>
<p>Because Vez) = V(z), we expect the one-dimensionalized wave functions, 
</p>
<p>u(z), to be either even or odd functions of z. Thus in the central exponential region, 
</p>
<p>region 1, with -Z2 &lt; Z &lt; +Z2, we would expect u(z) to be either a hyperbolic </p>

<p>The four eigenfunctions for the case n = 0 are shown qualitatively in Fig. P55.

<p>are even or odd with respect to reflections in the plane cf&gt; = 3; , where the potential

<p>again has a maximum. In particular, the eigenfunction u_ of the nondegenerate

<p>level, with IlE = - Q2Fiwo/rr, is even with respect to reflections in planes through 
any potential maximum, and the eigenfunction U+ of the nondegenerate level,

<p>with IlE = +Q2Fiwo/rr, is odd with respect to reflections in planes through any

<p>through successive potential maxima. Because any linear combination of the two

</p>
<p>The Two-Electron Atom 
</p>
<p>The indistinguishability of identical particles in quantum mechanics plays a very 
</p>
<p>important role. In macroscopic, classical physics we can tag our particles (by 
</p>
<p>painting infinitesimally small labels on them!) so we can distinguish those labelled, 
</p>
<p>1,2, etc., even though they have exactly the same mass, internal constitution, etc. 
</p>
<p>The impossibility of such a tagging procedure plays a very fundamental role in 
</p>
<p>quantum mechanics. 
</p>
<p>Consider one of the simplest systems with identical particles, the two-electron 
</p>
<p>He atom, with Hamiltonian 
</p>
<p>..... 2 .... 2 e2 -t -to -+ -+ .... ....

2f.L 2f.L rl - r2 
</p>
<p>where only the last term is dependent on the spins of the two electrons and de-
</p>
<p>pends on these through their Pauli a vectors. This fine structure term will include 
one-body spin-orbit and Thomas terms, two-body spin-magnetic moment-spin-
</p>
<p>magnetic moment interactions, and so on, and can be treated as truly small 
</p>
<p>perturbations on the zeroth-order terms including the Coulomb repulsion term, 
</p>
<p>e2 /rI2. Even with all fine structure terms, however, the Hamiltonian has a strictly 
</p>
<p>valid symmetry. It is invariant under the interchange of the particle indices, I and 
</p>
<p>2. 
</p>

</p>
<p>with eigenvalues + 1 and ~ I, respectively, for the operator 1'12- Thus. it seems 
that every energy level of the two-electron H must be two-fold degenerate to 
</p>
<p>all orders in perturbation theory, because the energy eigenfunctions can bc either 
</p>
<p>symmetric or antisymmetric. Even more, any linear combination of the symmetric 
</p>
<p>and antisymmetric functions will havc the same energy. Thus, 
</p>
<p>tjJ = c, with Ic,1 2 + 12 = 1, (4) 
</p>
<p>is an equally acceptable energy eigenfunction of our H. This function, however, 
</p>
<p>leads to a tremendous dilemma. For this last \{I, with arbitrary c., and Ca , the 
</p>
<p>probability one electron is at position ro, with spin alignment ao, and the other 
electron is at position r(;, with spin alignment ad, is given by 
</p>
<p>P(ro, ao; r~, n\;) = IIlJ(ro. ao; r~, a~)12 + I \{I (r(;. a~; ro, ao)l2

= 2(!c,1 2 11jr(5)1 2 + Ica I 2 1jr(a)1 2 ). (5) 
</p>
<p>We must add the probability the clectron we have labeled I is at ro with spin 
alignment given by ao, and electron 2 is at the primed position with primed spin 
</p>
<p>alignment, to the probability the electron we have labeled 2 is at position ro with 
spin alignment given by 0-0 , because we cannot distinguish electrons I and 2. Also, 
</p>
<p>this probability, a physically measurable quantity, seems to be dependent on c, 
</p>
<p>and Ca. Because 1..', can vary between 0 and 1, it seems this physically measurable 
</p>
<p>quantity has an essentially arbitrary predicted value. Consider, in particular, thc 
</p>
<p>special case in which both electrons are situated at the same position, ro, and both 
have the same spin alignment given by 0-0 . In this case 1jr(II) = 0, so in this case 
this probability would be 21c, :211jr(s)1 2 &bull; Because Cs can vary between 0 and 1, this 
probability could seemingly be anything between () and a maximum of 211jr(5)1 2 &bull; 
</p>
<p>The way out of this seeming dilemma is furnished by nature herself! An additional 
</p>
<p>property of nature exists, first discovered empirically. The states of a system of n 
</p>
<p>identical particles are either all totally symmetric or all totally antisymmetric. 
</p>
<p>The totally symmetric states are symmetric under any pair exchange and hence 
</p>
<p>under any number of pair exchanges or any permutation of the n particle indices. 
</p>
<p>This symmetry holds for systems of identical particles with integer spins; that is, 
</p>
<p>s = 0, I, 2, .. '. Such particles are known as Bose-Einstein particles or as bosons. 
</p>
<p>The totally antisymmetric states change sign under any pair exchange and, hence, 
</p>
<p>any odd permutation of the particle indices involving an odd number of pair ex-
</p>
<p>changes, while they do not change sign under even permutations of the particle 
</p>
<p>indiccs, involving arl even number of pair exchanges. This case applies to sys--
</p>
<p>terns of identical particles with ~ -integral spin, s== 1, ~, ~, .. '. Such particles arc 
known as Fermi-Dirac particles or as fermions. </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>38. The Two-Electron Atom 383 
</p>
<p>Because electrons have s = ~, they are fermions and belong to the antisym-
</p>
<p>metric case. The antisymmetry, however, applies to the total wave function. A 
</p>
<p>two-electron system could have a two-particle orbital wave function symmetric 
</p>
<p>under the pair exchange operator applied to orbital states, provided it is multiplied 
</p>
<p>by an anti symmetric two-particle spin function, or vice versa. Because our Hamil-
</p>
<p>tonian is spin-independent in first approximation (where we can neglect spin-orbit 
</p>
<p>and spin magnetic-moment-spin magnetic moment interactions), we would expect 
</p>
<p>a product of purely orbital and purely spin functions to be a good approximation. 
</p>
<p>Let us look at the two-particle spin function first. Let us, in particular, couple 
</p>
<p>the two single-particle spins s to resultant two-particle spin, S. Later, we shall 
</p>
<p>specialize to the electron case with s = ~. For the moment, let s be arbitrary.

<p>Now, act on this 1fr with the operator P{2' where the superscript s indicates we 
permute indices only on spin functions 
</p>
<p>P{21fr(SI, S2)~s = L 1frm,.cS2)1frm,/s])(smSasmSbISMs}. (7) 
</p>
<p>Now, in the sum over the indices, m sa , m Sb ' let us rename the dummy indices, 
</p>
<p>mSa &laquo;-+ mSb ' and let us then rewrite the product of the two single-particle spin 
</p>
<p>functions in reverse order, to obtain 
</p>
<p>P{21fr(SI, S2)~s = L 1frm,JSI)1frm,/S2)(smsbsms"lSMs). (8)

</p>
<p>Thus, with s = ~-integer, so 2s = odd integer, two-particle spin functions, with 
</p>
<p>S = 0, 2, ... , even integer, are antisymmetric, whereas two-particle spin func-
tions, with S = 1, 3, .. " odd integer, are symmetric. For the special case of 
</p>
<p>electrons, with s = ~, the two-particle state with S = 0 is antisymmetric, whereas 
</p>
<p>the two-particle states with S = I are symmetric. The antisymmetric two-particle 
spin states, with S = 0, must now be matched with a symmetric two-particle 
</p>
<p>orbital state; similarly, the symmetric two-particle spin states, with S = 1, must 
</p>
<p>be matched with anti symmetric two-particle orbital states. For two-electron states

<p>Because 21 = even integer, in this case, symmetric two-particle states survive only

</p>
<p>(2S + 1), L is identified by the spectroscopic letter, a capital letter because the 
state is not a one-electron state, and the possible J values are given by a right 
</p>
<p>subscript. In the He atom, the ground state with nala = nbLb = 10, i.e., with 
</p>
<p>ground-state configuration (ls)2, must be a pure singlet state with L = 0, S = 0, 
</p>
<p>i.e., a I So state. Excited states with configurations such as (Is, 2s) or (Is, 2p) have 
</p>
<p>both a singlet and a triplet component, with L = 0 and L = 1, respectively, as 
shown in Fig. 38.1. Because only the small fine structure terms in our Hamiltonian

</p>
<p>which the order of the quantum numbers ab is exchanged in the ket relative to the

<p>order in the bra. The upper sign (+) refers to the singlet or S = 0 states, whereas 
the lower sign (-) refers to the triplet S = 1 states. Because our H(I) = +Z/rI2 
is a positive (repulsive) interaction term, we can expect both Dab and Xab to be 
</p>
<p>positive numbers. Thus, we would expect the triplet states to lie somewhat below 
</p>
<p>the singlet states, as shown in Fig. 38.1. This is a special case of Hund's rule. In a

<p>many-electron atom, we would expect the state with the largest possible number

state should be the state with highest possible total spin S.

<p>Finally, our final energies are spin-dependent, even though our Hamiltonian was

<p>n-Identical Particle States 
</p>
<p>For the two-particle system, it was easy to make two-particle wavefunctions either 
</p>
<p>symmetric or anti symmetric under exchange of particle indices. Moreover, it was 
</p>
<p>easy to write the full two-particle wave functions as products of two-particle orbital 
</p>
<p>and two-particle spin functions. For n-particle systems, however, it is in princi-
</p>
<p>ple straightforward to make a totally symmetric or a totally anti symmetric wave 
</p>
<p>function by acting on a product of n single-particle functions, with a symmetrizer 
</p>
<p>or an antisymmetrizer operator, provided the single-particle functions include all 
</p>
<p>variables, orbital and spin variables (and perhaps other internal variables, if they 
</p>
<p>exist), appropriate for the n-particle system. We will denote the symmetrizer by 
</p>
<p>S and the antisymmctrizer by A. For the two-particle system, we can construct 
</p>
<p>symmetric and anti symmetric 2-partic1e functions via 
</p>
<p>1/I(s)(rl, a] ;1'2,0-2) = [s = (1 + P(l2&raquo;] 1/Ia(r] , 0-1 ) 1/Ib(rz , 0-2),

</p>
<p>where a and b now stand for all single-particle quantum numbers, c.g., a == 
nul"ml" mSa &bull; To generalize this to n-particle systems, the symmctrizer must include, 
</p>
<p>besides the identity operation, a sum over all possible permutation operators for 
</p>
<p>the n-partic1e system. That is, 
</p>
<p>S=2)-&gt;, (2)

</p>
<p>where the sum includes all n! possible permutation operators, P, including the 
</p>

</p>
<p>where P(ij) are pair exchange operators, which exchange the indices i and j on both 
</p>
<p>orbital and spin variables. The permutation operator P(123) designates the cyclic 
</p>
<p>interchange of labels (123) in the order 1 -+ 2,2 -+ 3,3 -+ 1. This interchange 
</p>
<p>could be achieved by first making the pair exchange I # 3 followed by the pair ex-
</p>
<p>change 2 # 3; i.e., P(l23) = P(23)P(l3). We could just as well have expressed P(l23) 
by P(123) = P(13)P(12), or in many other ways, e.g., P(l23) = P(13)P(23) P(i2) P(13). 
p( 123) will, however, always involve a product of an even number of pair exchanges. 
</p>
<p>In general, the n! permutations of n labels involve ~ n! even permutations, includ-
</p>
<p>ing the identity operation, and ~n! odd permutations. All even permutations can 
</p>
<p>be expressed in terms of products of an even number of pair exchanges, and all 
</p>
<p>odd permutations can be expressed in terms of products of an odd number of pair 
</p>
<p>exchanges. For n = 4, the 24 permutation operators include the identity operation, 
six pair exchanges of type P(ij)' three double pair exchanges of type P(ij)P(kl), 
</p>
<p>eight cyclic interchanges of type P(ijk) in which one label remains invariant, and 
</p>
<p>six cyclic interchanges of all four labels of type P(ijkl), where the latter are odd 
</p>
<p>permutations. 
</p>
<p>To build a totally symmetric n-particle state, for an n-boson system, we simply 
</p>
<p>act with the symmetrizer, S, on a product of n single particle states. If the latter 
</p>
<p>are given in Dirac ket notation, e.g., 
</p>
<p>laaaaabbccc ... ), 
</p>
<p>where a == na1amla mSa; i.e., the quantum numbers for a include all orbital and all 
other (internal) quantum numbers, such as the spin quantum number ms. In this 
</p>
<p>example, the particles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are all in the same quantum state, a, 
</p>
<p>whereas particles labeled 6 and 7 are in quantum state, b, and particles labeled 8, 
</p>
<p>9, 10 are in quantum state, c, and so on. The operator S acting on such a state 
</p>
<p>does not give a normalized state vector, but it is straightforward to construct the 
</p>
<p>normalized totally symmetric state vector,

<p>in quantum state b, n3 particles exist in quantum state c, and on on. Note, in 
</p>
<p>particular, that all n bosons could be in the same quantum state. Also, in eq. (4) 
</p>
<p>the symmetrizer, S, now includes only permutations that exchange particles in 
</p>
<p>different quantum states, e.g., P(l6) but not p(l2). 
</p>
<p>For n-fermion states, we construct the n-particle states in the same way using 
</p>
<p>an n-particle antisymmetrizer, A, 
</p>
<p>with u(P) = even (odd)

<p>where the particle indices, (i), are shorthand for (r;, a;). This n-particle wave func-
</p>
<p>tion is totally antisymmetric. An odd permutation of particle indices corresponds 
</p>
<p>to an odd permutation of rows of the determinant and therefore changes the sign 
</p>
<p>of the determinant. Similarly, an even permutation of indices corresponds to an 
</p>
<p>even pemmtation of rows of the detenninant and does not change the sign of the 
</p>
<p>determinant. 
</p>
<p>Even though we have succeeded in constructing n-particle wave functions ofthe 
</p>
<p>appropriate totally symmetric or totally antisymmetric character, these functions 
</p>
<p>may not be easy to work with. Later in the course (Chapters 78 and 79) we shaH 
</p>
<p>develop special techniques to deal with n-boson or n-fermion systems, involving 
</p>
<p>single-boson or single-fermion creation and annihilation operators, with special 
</p>
<p>commutation or anticommutation relations, respectively. The boson creation and 
</p>
<p>annihilation operators are very similar to harmonic oscillator creation and annihila-
</p>
<p>tion operators. The fermion creation and annihilation operators will be particularly 
</p>
<p>useful in quantum field theory, and we shall meet them there. 
</p>
<p>A final remark: For the n-e\ectron atom, we would find it very convenient to 
</p>
<p>separate the n-particle wave function into a product of an n-particle orbital function 
</p>
<p>and an n-particle spin function because our Hamiltonian has only a very weak 
</p>
<p>dependence on spin. For n = 2, this separation was trivial and led to orbitally 
</p>
<p>symmetric spin singlet states and orbitally anti symmetric spin triplet states. For 
</p>
<p>n = 3, this separation is already much more complicated. States with S = ~ have 
totally symmetric three-particle spin functions. This fact is immediately apparent 
</p>
<p>for the three-particle spin state with S = ~ and M s = ~. It follows for the states 
with lower values of Ms because the three-particle Ms-lowering operator, S = 
</p>
<p>S_ (1) + S_ (2)&middot;+- S_(3), is totally symmetric, i.e., invariant under any permutation of 
particle indices. For these threc-particle quartet spin states with S = ~, it is trivial 
</p>
<p>to combine this totally symmetric spin state with a totally antisymmetric orbital 
</p>
<p>state. The three orbital quantum numbers na1am'a' nb, lb, mlu, and nclemle must 
</p>
<p>differ in at least one of the three quantum numbers, in this totally antisymmetric 
</p>
<p>orbital state. Next, it is impossible to make a totally anti symmetric three-particle 
</p>
<p>spin state, because the single-particle spin states have only two available quantum </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>states, ms = &plusmn;~. We would require three different single-particle spin states 
</p>
<p>to make a totally antisymmetric three-particle spin function. Three-particle spin 
</p>
<p>functions, with S = ~, thus, must have a mixed intennediate symmetry, neither 
</p>
<p>totally anti symmetric nor totally symmmetric. They must be combined with three-
</p>
<p>particle orbital functions also of such a mixed symmetry. Actually two types of 
</p>
<p>intennediate-symmetry three-particle functions exist, and the two orbital and two 
</p>
<p>spin functions must be combined in proper linear combination to make a totally 
</p>
<p>antisymmetric total three-particle function. Already, for n = 3, this is no longer a 
</p>
<p>completely trivial problem. For elegant techniques of handling such problems, we 
</p>
<p>will find it advantageous to use the detailed properties of the pennutation group of

<p>The Variational Method 
</p>
<p>Our final perturbation technique is the variational technique, which is particularly 
</p>
<p>well-suited for finding approximations to ground-state energies and wave func-
</p>
<p>tions. We shall apply it, in particular, to find approximations to the ground-state 
</p>
<p>energy and wave functions for the He atom. 
</p>
<p>The variational method employs the following functional: Let the solutions 
</p>
<p>of an energy eigenvalue problem be part of a function space, part or all of our 
</p>
<p>Hilbert space, and let 1/1 be a particular function of that space. Then, we define the 
functional, a function of functions 1/1 to be varied, through 
</p>
<p>E([1/I]) = (1/IIHI1/I) 
(1/I11/I) , 
</p>
<p>(1) 
</p>
<p>where 11/1) is square-integrable, but not necessarily normalized to unity; i.e., (1/1 11/I) 
is finite (nonzero), but not necessarily normalized to unity. Also E ([ 1/1]) gives the 
average energy of the system in the state 11/1). The variational method is based on 
the following theorem. 
</p>
<p>Theorem: Any state vector, 11/1), for which the average energy, considered as a 
functional of the vectors of the full state vector space, is stationary is an eigenvector 
</p>
<p>of the discrete spectrum of H; and the corresponding energy eigenvalue is the 
</p>
<p>stationary value of E ([ 1/1 D. 
If we could actually carry out a variation of 1/1, starting with some assumed 
</p>
<p>value of 1/1 and varying 1/1 by small steps by rotating 1/1 by small amounts in the 
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, such that we could end by finding the true 
</p>
<p>minimum of the functional, we would attain the ground state eigenvector and 
</p>
<p>eigenvalue exactly. Similarly, a local minimum or maximum would give us excited-
</p>
<p>state eigenvectors and eigenvalues. In actual practice, of course, we cannot do this </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>394 40. The Variational Method 
</p>
<p>even with modem computers. The way the method is actually used is to restict the 
</p>
<p>variation of 1/1, not to the set of all functions of the full space, but to a judiciously 
chosen subset of functions, perhaps a finite number of eigenfunctions of a closely 
</p>
<p>related exactly soluble problem, which we guess to be the most important subspace 
</p>
<p>of our full space. Alternatively, we might restrict the functions 1/1 to those of 
a specific analytical form that we guess to be good candidates. (Our physical 
</p>
<p>intuition comes into play here!) These analytical functions should contain a few 
</p>
<p>undetermined (variation) parameters, which are fixed at the values making the 
</p>
<p>variation 0 E = O. If we denote these functions, &lt;1&gt;, and vary E ([ &lt;1&gt;]) such that 
</p>
<p>8E([&lt;1&gt;]) = 0, we may get a good approximation to the exact energy if E([&lt;1&gt;o]) 
</p>
<p>and E([ 1/10)] differ by only a small amount. 
</p>
<p>A Proof of the Variational Theorem 
</p>
<p>To prove the variational principle theorem, let us put E([ VI]) in the form 
</p>
<p>E([1/I])(1/IIv/) = (1/IIHi1/l) (2) 
</p>
<p>and make the variation to give 
</p>
<p>8E(v/Iv/) + E(81/111/1) + E(1/I181/1) = (81/1iHI1/I) +- (1/IIHI81/1), (3) 
</p>
<p>or 
</p>

<p>Hence, we see: If :1/1) is an exact solution of (H ~ E)11/I) = 0, and if (1/111/1) is 
finite and nonzero, 8 E = O. 
</p>
<p>Also, If 8E = 0,

<p>(81/11UI ~ E)11/I) + (1/I1(H ~ E)181,1/) = O. (5)

<p>N ow, the variation of 11/1&middot;) and the variation of (1/1 1 are not independent, but because 
our vector space is a complex vector space and the variation of 11/1) is completely 
arbitrary, we could vary the pure real and pure imaginary parts of 11/1) separately 
and independently of each other. Equivalently, we could vary l1rst 11/1) to give eq. 
(5), and then vary i 11/I} to give 
</p>
<p>~ i(81/11(H ~ E)11/I) + i(1/IICH- E)181/1) = o. 
</p>
<p>Eqs. (5) and (6), together, then yield: If 8E = 0,

<p>B Bounds on the Accuracy of the Variational Method 
</p>
<p>Because, in actual practice, we cannot vary the 11/1) of the full vector space, but 
will vary instead the 1&lt;1&gt;} of a highly restricted subspace of our vector space, it will 
</p>
<p>be very useful to try to get a bound on the variational values of the energy obtained 
</p>
<p>by this technique. We will show, in the subspace of the 1&lt;1&raquo;, the variation of the 
</p>
<p>I&lt;P), which gives 8E([&lt;1&gt;]) = 0, leads to an E([&lt;PJ) such that 
</p>
<p>E([&lt;1&gt;]) :::: Eo, (8) 
</p>
<p>where Eo is the exact value of the ground-state energy. To prove this, calculate

<p>where we have merely inserted the unit operator, I:all n In) (n I, into the equation and

<p>In) is the exact eigenvector of H with eigenvalue En. The sum in this equation may 
</p>
<p>include an integral over continuous energy values if the spectrum of eigenvalues 
</p>
<p>E contains both a discrete part and a continuum. From the above, we get 
</p>
<p>E = ""'CE - E )(&lt;1&gt;ln) (nl&lt;1&raquo; = ""'CE - E )1(n l&lt;1&raquo;1 2 &gt;, O. (10)

</p>
<p>Thus, we know the sign of the error made in the variational technique, although the 
</p>
<p>magnitude of the error is difficult to estimate, which is one of the drawbacks of the 
</p>
<p>technique. However, we can proceed as follows: If we have found an approximate 
</p>
<p>E([&lt;1&gt;d) by varying the parameters in the set offunctions &lt;PJ to obtain an E([&lt;1&gt;d), 
</p>
<p>and if we subsequently take a more sophisticated (and hopefully better) set of 
</p>
<p>trial functions, &lt;1&gt;2. perhaps with a larger number of variational parameters, then 
</p>
<p>if E([&lt;1&gt;2]) &lt; E([&lt;1&gt;d), we know E([&lt;P 2 ]) is a better approximation to the ground-
</p>
<p>state energy. In principle, this process could be continued to further improve our 
</p>
<p>approximation. The absolute value ofthe error in the final approximation, however, 
</p>
<p>may still be quite uncertain.

</p>
<p>The first step of the calculation involves a good choice of functions, &lt;1&gt;. Here, 
</p>
<p>the ingenuity of the calculator comes to the fore. We want a family of &cent;, simple 
</p>
<p>enough for ease of calculation, yet complicated enough to get an accurate result. 
</p>
<p>In our perturbation calculation for the He atom, our zeroth-order wave function, a 
</p>
<p>simple product of hydrogenic Is wave functions, took no account of the presence 
</p>
<p>of the "second" electron. This electron partially shields the nucleus with charge 
</p>
<p>Z from the "first" electron, so this one effectively sees a charge ),Z rather than 
</p>
<p>the full charge Z. Here, the shielding factor A could be introduced as a very sim-

<p>To make an improvement over the simple one-parameter variational wave func-

</p>
<p>These trial &lt;l&gt; are now not nonnalized. Variation of the six parameters in these &lt;l&gt; led 
</p>
<p>to an E([&lt;l&gt;]) = -2.90362. This result violates our theorem, E([1&gt;]) :::: Eo(exact),

<p>So far, we have illustrated the variational method with the use oftrial functions built

<p>Introduction to Scattering Theory 
</p>
<p>A Potential Scattering 
</p>
<p>Until now, most of our applications have involved bound states of a quantum 
</p>
<p>system. Now, in starting scattering theory, we shall be dealing with states in the 
</p>
<p>continuum. We shall start by considering the scattering of a structure less point 
</p>
<p>particle of mass, m, and incident momentum, p, from a fixed scattering center via 
</p>
<p>an interaction describable by a potential, V (1\ or the equivalent one-body problem 
</p>
<p>for the relative motion of two structureless point particles of masses, m] and m2, 
</p>
<p>and reduced mass, m]m2/(m[ + m2), which again interact via a potential, V(i\ 
</p>
<p>where r is now the relative motion vector, r = r[ r2. 
Before starting, let us make some remarks about possible generalizations as 
</p>
<p>follows. 
</p>
<p>1. The particles may have spin, and a rearrangement of spin alignments may 
</p>
<p>occur during the scattering process, if the interaction between the particles include 
</p>
<p>spin-dependent forces. 
</p>
<p>2. The particles may not be treatable as point particles. They may be composites, 
</p>
<p>made of several constituent particles. During the collision process, excitations of 
</p>
<p>internal degrees of freedom of the particles may then occur (inelastic collisions), 
</p>
<p>or rearrangement collisions, where constituent particles from projectile may be 
</p>
<p>transferred to target or vice versa may occur. 
</p>
<p>3. Shortcomings may exist of the simple potential description of the scattering 
</p>
<p>process. This difficulty may lead to nonlocal potentials. Also, in scattering of 
</p>
<p>particles at relativi stic energies, a simple potential description may not be possible. 
</p>
<p>We shall restrict ourselves to nonrelativistic energies. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>402 41. Introduction to Scattering Theory 
</p>
<p>The scattering process is described by the Scattering Cross Section. 
</p>
<p>We assume we have an incoming beam of particles of definite fixed V, or mo-
mentum p, approximated by a plane wave, with specified incoming flux, that is, 
a fixed number of incoming particles per cm2 per second, (initial condition). We 
</p>
<p>want to calculate the probability particles are scattered into an element of solid 
</p>
<p>angle, dQ, about some direction fJ, tjJ, relative to the initial direction fixed by p. 
(See Fig. 41.1.) It is assumed the detector detecting the scattered particles is at a 
</p>
<p>distance r from the scattering center, where r is large compared with the size of 
</p>
<p>the scattering quantum system. The scattering cross section is defined by 
</p>
<p>number of particles scattered/sec into dQ at e, tjJ 
da =----------------- = Ice tjJ)dQ 
</p>
<p>number of particles/cm2/sec in incoming beam ' , 
</p>
<p>where 
</p>
<p>and

dQ 
</p>
<p>a = r 12][ dQ(da) = total scattering cross section. 
JIi=O &cent;=o dQ 
</p>
<p>(1) 
</p>
<p>For the relative motion of the two-body problem, we need to discuss the transfor-
</p>
<p>mation from the laboratory coordinates,'1 and'2, to the center of mass coordinates. 
</p>
<p>If we sit on the center of mass, the scattering process is describable by the relative 
</p>

<p>In the laboratory, particle 1, the projectile, will have an initial momentum, (m I VI )0, 
</p>
<p>whereas particle 2, the target particle, will have an initial momentum of zero. After 
</p>
<p>the scattering process, particle I will have a final momentum, ml Vi, making an 
angle Blah_ with the initial momentum direction, whereas particle 2 will recoil with 
</p>
<p>momentum m2v2 at an angle (h with respect to the initial momentum direction. 
(See Fig. 41.2.) We shall denote momentum and position vectors in the center of 
</p>
<p>mass system with a prime. In the center of mass system, the initial momentum of 
</p>
<p>particle 2 must be (p2)~ = -(pI)~. Similarly for the final momenta, p~ = - p;. For 
true point particles, the scattering process is elastic, leading to 1 P: 1 = 1 (pI)~ I. The 
final momentum vector in the center of mass system has the same magnitude as the 
</p>
<p>initial momentum vector, but makes an angle e relative to the initial momentum

<p>A Potential Scattering 407 
</p>
<p>To solve the scattering problem, we need to find solutions to the Schrodinger 
</p>
<p>equation 
</p>
<p>(18) 
</p>
<p>where 1{r is a function of the relative coordinate vector r for the two-body system. 
Moreover, the solutions 1{r we seek must satisfy the boundary conditions of the 
</p>
<p>physical situation: Asymptotically, as r ~ 00, 1{r must be of the form, 1{r = 
</p>
<p>incoming plane wave + spherical outgoing wave starting from the scattering center; 
</p>
<p>that is, as r ~ 00, 
</p>
<p>_ eikr 
</p>
<p>1{r = e ik .;: + fee, &cent;)-, 
r 
</p>
<p>(19) 
</p>
<p>where k = p/ft. The function, fee, &cent;), is known as the scattering amplitude. The 
flux for the incoming wave, 1{rinc. = eik:;, is 
</p>
<p>Ii ~ ~ * Ii. ~ . ~ lik p ~

2IL i mc. mc. . 21L1 IL IL 
</p>
<p>Similarly, the flux of the outgoing scattered wave, normal to the surface of the 
</p>
<p>detector, at a distance, r ~ 00, is 
</p>
<p>~(1{r* a1{rout -1{rout a1{r;ut) = lik If(e, &cent;)1 2 + order(~), (21)

<p>(22) 
</p>
<p>(23) 
</p>
<p>A note about the normalization of our 1{r is perhaps in order. Above we have 
</p>
<p>normalized the incoming plane wave such that the incoming flux had magnitude, 
</p>
<p>likj IL = v == Vrel.. This normalization factor, however, drops out in the expres-
sion for the cross section. A second possibility might have been to normalize the 
</p>
<p>incoming plane wave to unit flux, in which case we could have used 
</p>
<p>eik .;: 
</p>
<p>1{rinc. = .jV' (24) 
</p>
<p>Since, k, and hence p, has a continuous spectrum, we could also have normalized 
the incoming plane wave according to the standard coordinate space representation

</p>
<p>so these plane wave states have the standard Dirac delta function orthonormality 
</p>
<p>property, {k'lk} = 8(k' - k). Alternatively, we could have used the coordinate 
space function 
</p>
<p>(26) 
</p>
<p>so {p'lp} = 8(p' - p). 
Finally, we could have used a box normalization for our plane wave by imagining 
</p>
<p>that all of our quantum systems are located in a cubical "laboratory" where the cube 
</p>
<p>has a side of length L, hence, volume, L 3; where L is a macroscopic quantity; and 
</p>
<p>where all wave functions must be zero at the surface of the cube. This means that 
</p>
<p>we will replace the continuous spectrum for k with a very finely spaced discrete 
spectrum, with 
</p>
<p>(27) 
</p>
<p>where the ni are integers (positive or negative). [This condition means the wave-
</p>
<p>lengths of our discrete set of states are such that our cube of side L must contain an 
</p>
<p>integral (rather than a !-integral) number of wavelengths, so we are using so-called 
</p>
<p>periodic boundary conditions.] With this type of plane wave state, our plane wave 
</p>
<p>functions are normalized according to 
</p>
<p>~ eikn&middot;r eikn -' 
uii(r) = frl = tu::l' 
</p>
<p>V L3 v Vol. 
</p>
<p>where the orthonormality integral is now given by

<p>(kii'lkii) = 8n,n',8n2n;8n3n; 
</p>
<p>(28) 
</p>
<p>(29) 
</p>
<p>in terms of ordinary Kronecker deltas. Because no quantum-mechanical result 
</p>
<p>for a system of atomic or subatomic size can depend on the size or shape of the 
</p>
<p>macroscopic "laboratory," the Volume = L 3, must drop out of all meaningful final 
</p>
<p>results that must be independent of L. This form of the plane wave state, therefore, 
</p>
<p>has its uses, and we shall occasionally use it as a pedagogic device. For the moment, 
</p>
<p>however, we shall stick with the normalization of eq. (19). 
</p>
<p>To solve the relative motion problem and find solutions of the form of eq. (19), it 
</p>
<p>will be useful to expand both the incoming plane wave and the scattering amplitude, 
</p>
<p>fce, 4&raquo;, in spherical harmonics. Choosing our z axis along the direction of the 
incoming k,

<p>where it will be useful to write the radial functions in terms of the dimensionless

<p>To recognize this equation, it will be useful to make the transformation, u/(p) =

are needed to get the "standard" functions.]

<p>To get the needed properties of the spherical Bessel and Neumann functions, we

<p>which yield the functions U~(l+l)' and hence the spherical Neumann functions, are 
</p>
<p>acceptable through the invariance of the quantity I (l + 1) under the transformation 
1 ---+ -(I + 1). To get the starting function, for the 1 step processes, we look at the 
equation for 1 = 0 
</p>
<p>(39) 
</p>
<p>so Uo could be either sin p or cos p. Note, however, that Uo is identified with io 
</p>
<p>through Jo = uo/p, and since the Jt(p) are the solutions regular at the origin, 
p = 0, we must choose Uo = sin p; hence, Jo = sin p / p. From this, we get

<p>The coefficient of the (z + 1 i term has contributions only from terms with n = I-k,

<p>Finally, we can also use the contour integral expressions to evaluate the infinite

</p>
<p>For such a potential, the effective V (r) approaches the pure centrifugal term for 
</p>
<p>sufficiently large r. Also, we exclude for the moment the case of scattering via 
</p>
<p>a Coulomb potential with a V (r) that goes to zero only as 1/ r at large r. Our

<p>assumed V (r) would be good for the scattering of neutrons from complex nuclei, 
</p>
<p>but the scattering of charged particles from nuclei, e.g., the scattering of protons or

<p>alpha particles from nuclei, would require a slightly more complicated treatment.]

<p>A number of remarks are in order, as follows. 
</p>
<p>1. For V (r) -+ 0, 81 (k) -+ O. In this case, we are left only with the free incoming 
</p>
<p>plane wave. 
</p>
<p>2. In the limit ofvery large k, in particular, for Ii~~ &raquo; I Vrnax I, again 8I (k) -+ 0 as 
k -+ very large. Effectively, the potential again becomes insignificant compared 
</p>
<p>with the energy of the incoming beam. 
</p>
<p>3. For an attractive V(r), 8(k) &gt; O. In this case, the wavelength becomes 
</p>
<p>shorter in the small r region where the potential is effective, and the [fh partial wave 
</p>
<p>is pulled into smaller values of r as a result (see Fig. 42.1). Say the first minimum 
</p>
<p>of the [lh partial wave beyond the region where the true VCr) is effectively zero 
</p>
<p>occurs at a phase angle, Xl&middot; Then, (kr with - !!f + 81) = Ckr without - !!f) = Xlo where 
rWith is the position of this minimum with the potential VCr) turned on, whereas 
</p>
<p>rwithout is the position of this minimum without the potential, that is, for the free 
</p>
<p>partial wave. Because rwith &lt; rwithout, 81Ck) &gt; O. 
Similarly, for a repulsive VCr), 8t(k) &lt; O. 
</p>
<p>4. The total scattering cross section, a, is related to the imaginary part of the 
</p>
<p>scattering amplitude, fCO = 0). From the second form for fCO) and a above, 
</p>
<p>4JT 
a(k) = k~[JCO = 0)]. (13)

</p>
<p>Note,

</p>
<p>different from zero and the magnitude k of the incoming wave. Thus, although 
</p>
<p>our expressions for both ~; and a in general involve an infinite series in I, only

<p>a finite number of terms may be effective. Suppose the range of our VCr) is ro;

<p>particles from structureless point target particles. If we name projectile particle, a, 
</p>
<p>and target particle, A, we have in general three possibilities, as follows. 
</p>
<p>(1) a + A ~ a + A, the elastic scattering process. 
(2) a + A ~ a + A'. Particle A is in an excited state after the scattering process 
</p>
<p>and the final kinetic energy of the relative motion is less than the initial kinetic 
</p>
<p>energy. This is an inelastic scattering process. 
</p>
<p>(3) a + A ~ b + B. This is a rearrangement collision. The ejectiles are different 
from the initial projectile and target particles. In such a process, the number of 
</p>
<p>outgoing particles could also be greater than two. 
</p>
<p>The different processes are labeled by a "channel" index: a for the elastic process 
</p>
<p>(1) and f3 = f31 + f32 + ... for the processes of type (2) and (3). For the case of 
structureless point particles, we could have written our solution, as r --+ 00, in the

<p>Continuum Solutions for the Coulomb Problem 
</p>
<p>In the main body of Chapter 42, we restricted our discussion to potentials that go to 
</p>
<p>zero faster than 1/ r2 as r -+ 00. This, therefore, excluded the important case of the 
Coulomb potential, V (r) = Z 1 Z2e2 / r, needed for the scattering of point charges 
</p>
<p>from point charges. We shall be interested, in particular, in the asymptotic form of 
</p>
<p>the [th partial wave solutions, WI, in the limit r -+ 00, to obtain the analogues of 
</p>
<p>the incoming and outgoing wave solutions, I/(kr) and O/(kr). 
</p>
<p>For the Coulomb potential, the one-dimensionalized wave equation is given by 
</p>
<p>d2Wt + (k2 _ 2f.L ZI Z 2e2 _ l(l + I&raquo;)w/ = 0,

<p>A Specific Example: Scattering from

<p>To solve a very specific example, let us look first at the scattering from a spherical

</p>
<p>(see Fig. 43.1), where the constant Vo could be eithernegative (attractive potential) 
</p>
<p>or positive (repulsive potential), including Vo = +00, the so-called hard sphere 
</p>
<p>case. The latter might be a good approximation for the scattering of noble gas 
</p>
<p>atoms from noble gas atoms. In this case, classical scattering theory would be

<p>sufficient for gases at temperatures such that A &laquo; a. Quantum theory would be

<p>uo(r) = A(r - asc.I.), (9) 
</p>
<p>where the constant, asc .i., is known as the "scattering length." For finite but very

<p>At very low energies, therefore, the cross section is given by the square of the 
</p>
<p>scattering length. The scattering length can be both positive and negative, and its 
</p>
<p>absolute value can be much larger than the range of the potential, roo For example, 
</p>
<p>if the interior solution for r &lt; ro is such that the interior Uo at E = 0 has a curvature 
</p>
<p>toward the abscissa such that it has just begun to bend over beyond a maximum, 
</p>
<p>at r = ro (see Fig. 44.2), the scattering length will be large and positive. If, 
conversely, the interior wave function has not quite reached a maximum at r = ro, 
</p>
<p>the scattering length will have a large negative value (see Fig. 44.4). 
</p>
<p>It is interesting to look at the neutron-proton system. The n-p potential is a

<p>potential of the form shown in Fig. 44.3, with a well-defined ro of approximately 2

<p>neutron and proton have a spin of ~, the two-particle spin, S, can be either S = 1,

<p>or S = O. The n-p system has only a single (barely)-bound state, at -2.2 MeV,

<p>Conversely, the S = 0 potential is not sufficiently attractive, so even at E = 0 the

<p>The Born Approximation

<p>In the last chapter, we merely reformulated the scattering problem. Instead of

<p>solving the scattering problem by finding a solution to a differential equation with

</p>
<p>solution to an integral equation with the appropriate Green's function. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Because we cannot do the integral containing the unknown o/r,Ji I), we are far from 
</p>
<p>a solution. If V (r) is a weak potential, however, so it can be treated by perturbation 
</p>
<p>theory, or ifthe energy is very large, so the average V(r) is small compared with 
</p>
<p>this energy, we can solve the integral equation by an iteration technique. If

</p>
<p>where this approximate solution is known as the first Born approximation. Even 
</p>
<p>without putting this first approximation back into the integral equation to get the

</p>
<p>simple first Born approximation may be a useful good approximation. [n that case, </p>

<p>Exact Solution for the Pure Coulomb Scattering Problem 
</p>
<p>In the appendix to Chapter 42, we solved the problem for Coulomb scattering in a 
</p>
<p>partial wave expansion, where the relative motion function was expanded in radial 
</p>
<p>functions, RICkr), and in spherical harmonics, 1{!(r, e, (jJ) = L1RI(kr)YIO(e, &cent;). 
</p>
<p>Our main aim there was to get the asymptotic form in the limit of large r of the 
</p>
<p>incoming and outgoing Coulomb spherical waves. These results are particularly 
</p>
<p>useful if the long-range part of the potential is dominated by the Coulomb potential, </p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>but if, in addition, a short-range potential exists, such as a nuclear potentiaL As in 
</p>
<p>any partial wave expansion, this approach leads to differential and total scattering 
</p>
<p>cross sections in terms of infinite series in the l's of the partial waves. For the case 
</p>
<p>of pure Coulomb scattering, however, we can find an exact solution that gives us the 
</p>
<p>scattering amplitude exactly, (without need of an infinite series). This amplitUde 
</p>
<p>would apply, e.g., for proton-nucleus, or a-nucleus scattering, or u-a scattering, 
</p>
<p>at energies low enough, so the proton or a particle has a very low probability of 
</p>
<p>tunneling through the repulsive Coulomb barrier into the small r region, where the 
</p>
<p>nuclear force would become effective.

<p>Operator Form of Scattering Green's 
Function and the Integral Equation for 
the Scattering Problem 
</p>
<p>So far, we have worked strictly in coordinate representation for the very limited 
</p>
<p>problem of the scattering of a structureless point particle from another structureless 
</p>
<p>point particle. To generalize to more complicated situations involving composite 
</p>
<p>projectile and target particles, with the possibility of inelastic collision processes 
</p>
<p>or rearrangement collisions, or even to iterate the Born approximation for the case 
</p>
<p>of structureless point particles, it will be advantageous to recast both the scattering 
</p>
<p>Green's function and the scattering integral equation into operator form. 
</p>
<p>In coordinate representation, we solved the scattering problem, 
</p>
<p>(E - H)1{IS+)(r) = 0 
k 
</p>
<p>(E - Ho)1{It)(r) = (E - Ho)4&gt;rP) + V(r)1{ItV), 
</p>
<p>by introducing the Green's function, C(+)(r, r '), where 
</p>
<p>(E - Ho)C(+V, r') = 8(r - r'), 
</p>
<p>(1) 
</p>
<p>(2) 
</p>
<p>and converting eq. (1) into the form of an integral equation. [In Chapters 45 and 
</p>
<p>46, we found it convenient to multiply the operators (E - Ho) and (E - H) 
</p>
<p>in these equations through by the factor ~i to carry out the integrations in k 
</p>
<p>space. We will find it more convenient now to go back to the original Schrodinger 
</p>
<p>normalization. In this normalization, the Green's function of Chapter 45 would

</p>
<p>11/1) = Idr'lr'), (r'11/I) (3) 
</p>
<p>so, we can think of the Green's function not only in coordinate representation, 
</p>
<p>but also in any representation, expressed in terms of any convenient basis. In fact, 
</p>
<p>we will introduce an operator form of the Green's function and then express the 
</p>
<p>Green's operator in any convenient basis. In coordinate representation, we have 
</p>
<p>(+) ~ ~, . I ~, ifJk,cr&gt;ifJi,(r') 
G (r, r ) = hm dk . 
</p>
<p>__ 0 (E(k) - E(k') + iE) 
(4) 
</p>
<p>Again, we have changed from (e - k,2) to E(k) - E(k') in this Green's function, 
and therefore from k + i'f/ to E(k) + iE, with E(k) + iE = 1: (k2 + 2ik'f/ + ... ), 
so E = (fPk)'f/. We will now think of this coordinate representation of the Green's 
</p>
<p>11 
</p>
<p>function as the coordinate representation matrix element of an operator, the Green's 
(+) 
</p>
<p>operator, Gop. ,

<p>G(+)(r, r') = (rIG(+)lr') = lim dk'(rlk') . (k'lr'), I ~... 1 ...

<p>so 
</p>
<p>G(+) = limldle'IIe'}(Ie'1 1 Ik')(Ie'I. (7) 
op. __ 0 E(k) - E(k') + iE 
</p>
<p>Henceforth, the limit, limE~O, will be quietly understood whenever an E appears 
</p>
<p>in an expression. Also, we could have written the Green's operator in the basis-

<p>Inelastic Scattering Processes and 
</p>
<p>Rearrangement Collisions 
</p>
<p>So far, we have seen the usefulness of the operator form of the Green's function and 
</p>
<p>the integral equation for the scattering problem in iterating the Born approximation 
</p>
<p>for the scattering of structureless point particles from structure less point particles. 
</p>
<p>The method becomes equally useful in discussing the scattering of composite 
</p>
<p>particles from composite particles, where inelastic processes and rearrangement 
</p>
<p>collisions come into play. 
</p>
<p>A Inelastic Scattering Processes 
</p>
<p>Consider the case in which we might have a scattering of a projectile from a 
</p>
<p>composite target particle (e.g., J-t- -atom scattering or J-t- -nucleus scattering; we 
</p>
<p>choose a J-t - as our projectile to avoid having identical particles as the components 
</p>
<p>of our composite target particle). Now, it will be useful to decompose 
</p>
<p>H=Ho+V, (1) 
</p>
<p>where Ho will include, besides the kinetic energy operator for the relative motion, 
</p>
<p>the Hamiltonian for the internal degrees of freedom of the composite particle.

<p>where the coefficient of e'&middot;" Xn'(~)' with n' = 0 and, hence, ks = Iksl = k, gives

</p>
<p>processes, where the composite target particle ends in the excited state with internal 
</p>
<p>energy, E~~t.. 
</p>
<p>B Rearrangement Collisions 
</p>
<p>Consider, e.g., the scattering of a J.L - from a hydrogen atom. In this case, we 
</p>
<p>can have, besides the elastic scattering process, not only the inelastic scattering 
</p>
<p>processes in which the hydrogen atom ends in an excited state, but also we could 
</p>
<p>have a rearrangement collision, in which the JL - is captured by the proton to make 
</p>
<p>a muonic atom while the atomic electron is scattered. (Because the ground-state 
</p>
<p>energy of the hydrogen atom is -13.61 eV, whereas the ground-state energy of the 
</p>
<p>muonic atom is ~ -2.5 KeV, the scattered electron would have an energy greater 
</p>
<p>than 2.5 KeV. An electron in the 2.5 t03 KeV range would have a vic ~ 0.1, which 
</p>
<p>is small enough for a treatment by nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and the Born 
</p>
<p>approximation should be good.) If we label the J.L- particle I, the e- particle 2, and 
</p>
<p>the p+ particle 3, the rearrangement collision, 1 + (2, 3) --+ 2 + (1, 3), is possible. 
An even more complex three-particle system could be illustrated by the scat-
</p>
<p>tering of a proton from the nucleus 17 0, which can be modelled by a neutron 
</p>
<p>orbiting the doubly magic nucleus, 16 0, with a n_ 16 0 binding energy of - 4.146 
</p>
<p>MeV. Because the first excited state of the tightly bound 16 0 nucleus is at 6.06 
</p>
<p>Me V, we could approximate this nucleus as an inert particle if the incident proton 
</p>
<p>energy is not too large. Thus, we could think of the proton as particle 1, the neutron 
</p>
<p>as particle 2, and the 160-nucleus as particle 3. Now, we could have all three ar-
</p>
<p>rangements of the particles labeled 1,2,3 (see Fig. 48.2). The proton could scatter 
</p>
<p>elastically or inelastically from 17 0. (The first excited state of 17 0 is at only 0.871 
</p>
<p>MeV.) The proton could also be captured, however, by the 16 0 nucleus to make 
</p>
<p>17 F, with a p_16 0 binding energy of -.601 MeV, the neutron being knocked out 
</p>
<p>in the reaction and being scattered. Finally, the proton could capture the loosely 
</p>
<p>bound neutron from 16 0 to make a deuteron, with binding energy of -2.226MeV, </p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>which is scattered relative to the 16 0 nucleus. Thus, the rearrangement collisions, 
</p>
<p>p + 17 0 -+ p + 17 0 1 + (2, 3) -+ 1 + (2, 3), 
</p>
<p>p+ 170-+n+ 17F 1+(2,3)-+2+(1,3), 
</p>
<p>p+ 17 0-+ 160+d 1+(2,3)-+3+(1,2), (12) 
</p>
<p>are all possible. In addition, if sufficient incident kinetic energy exists, we could 
</p>
<p>have a final state with three outgoing particles, proton, neutron, and 16 0. These 
</p>
<p>three-particle states would be excited states of all three final rearrangements, in-
</p>
<p>volving breakup of the two-particle aggregates. If insufficient energy for such a 
</p>
<p>breakup exists, we may have to consider only the above three rearrangement pro-
</p>
<p>cesses. Now, it will be convenient to split the full Hamiltonian, H, into an Ho and 
</p>
<p>an interaction term, V, in three different ways. 
</p>

H = Ho + V = ---Vt.23 + HinL(2, 3) + VI2 + VI3

</p>
<p>= H~' + V" = -~V~ 12 + H iot.(1, 2) + V13 + V23 . (13) 
2fL3,12 ' 
</p>
<p>It will now be useful to rewrite the integral equation for the scattering process 
</p>
<p>in three different ways. For this purpose, we will first rewrite the Lippmann-
</p>
<p>Schwinger equation in terms ofthejull Green's operator

<p>0&lt;+) = -----
op. E - H + iE' (14) 
</p>
<p>l1ftt) = (1 + E _ ~ + iE V}&cent;k}' (15) 
To derive this equation, which is the operator form of eq. (59) of Chapter 45, act 
</p>
<p>on the operator, E - H + iE = E - Ho + iE - V, with 0:,;: from the left and with

<p>A Specific Example of a Rearrangement 
</p>
<p>Collision: The (d, p) Reaction on 
</p>
<p>Nucleus A 
</p>
<p>To show in detail how the rearrangement collision integrals are calculated, we shall 
</p>
<p>study the (d, p) reaction on nucleus A, e.g., 160, to make nucleus B, e.g., 17 0, that 
</p>
<p>is, a nucleus in which the extra neutron captured by nucleus A orbits this nucleus 
</p>
<p>in a particular shell model orbit with orbital angular momentum, L. 
</p>
<p>d +A -+ B + p. 
</p>
<p>This equation fits the case of Chapter 48, if we label nucleus A by particle label 
</p>
<p>1, the proton by particle label 2, and the neutron by particle label 3. In the center 
</p>
<p>of mass system the composite particle (2,3) is then incident on particle 1 (see Fig. 
</p>
<p>50.1). We have

</p>
<p>~fJ = r3 - rl. (1) 
</p>
<p>(Note: We have changed some signs from Chapter 49, because we think of the 
</p>
<p>deuteron as the projectile and nucleus A as the target. All results of Chapter 49, 
</p>
<p>however, apply.) Energy conservation now gives us

<p>Eqs. (22) and (32) permit us to calculate the scattering amplitude for the

<p>the L dependence of Ipn comes from the so-called fonn factor, FB.NL(K) =

at Kr = 0, and therefore makes its largest contribution to the integral for angles

larger values of the argument Kr and therefore make larger contributions to the in-
</p>
<p>tegral at larger values of K and, hence, at larger values of O. Hence, the differential 
</p>
<p>cross sections for the (d, p) reaction are strongly L-dependent, peaking at 0 = 0

<p>for L = 0 and at larger angles, the larger the L value. Fig. 50.4 shows angular </p>

<p>Final Remarks: We have ignored the spins of both proton and neutron. It is well 
</p>
<p>known the energy positions of shell model orbits are strongly j-dependent. Thus, 
</p>
<p>the dl level in 17 0 lies much higher in energy than the d~ level, which makes 
2 2 
</p>
<p>the ground state of 17 0. Despite this strong spin-orbit coupling effect of the shell 
</p>
<p>model single-particle energies, this spin-orbit term does not playa strong role in 
</p>
<p>the (d, p) reaction. The differential cross sections for transitions to the d t ground 
state and the excited d~ state have an almost identica18-dependence, characteristic 
</p>
<p>2 
</p>
<p>of the orbital angular momentum, L = 2. 
</p>
<p>The first Born approximation we have used here uses zeroth-order wave func-
</p>
<p>tions that are plane waves, eigenfunctions of our simple Ho, which included only 
</p>
<p>the kinetic energy part of the relative motion Hamiltonian. A more sophisticated 
</p>
<p>Born approximation, the so-called distorted wave Born approximation, includes 
</p>
<p>within Ho not only the kinetic energy term of the relative motion, but also an 
</p>
<p>average potential for the incoming projectile, fitted to the elastic scattering cross 
</p>
<p>sections for the projectile (deuteron- 16 0 elastic scattering in our example), and a 
</p>
<p>similar average potential for the outgoing particle, the proton in our case, where this 
</p>
<p>potential is fitted to the elastic proton-I 7 0 scattering cross sections. Although this 
</p>
<p>more sophisticated distorted wave Born approximation gives much better quantita-
</p>
<p>tive results, qualitatively the plane wave Born approximation gives similar results. 
</p>
<p>Historically, therefore, it was an important tool in determining the L values of shell 
</p>
<p>model orbits. </p>

placed at the angular position, O2, q,2 = n:. Thus, with jiz = - sin q,2ex + cos q,zey ,

<p>As a final exercise, let us calculate the differential cross section for an incident

the directions of the x and y axes, we want to place our detector at an arbitrary

<p>azimuth an&amp;le, 41. sclative to the x-z plane. Now. the normal to the scattering plane 
defined by k and ks is given by n = - sin 41ex + cos 41ey, and

<p>(n . a) = - sin 41ax + cos 41ay = ay'. (27)

</p>
<p>Isospin 
</p>
<p>The simplicity of the algebra for the case of s = 4 -particles, involving the algebra 
of the Pauli u matrices, makes this chapter a good place to introduce a brief remark 
</p>
<p>about isospin. 
</p>
<p>For proton-proton, proton-neutron, or neutron-neutron scattering, the essential 
</p>
<p>charge independence of the nuclear force must be taken into account. (This charge 
</p>
<p>independence of the nucleon-nucleon interaction does not include the Coulomb 
</p>
<p>term in the proton-proton interaction. This is a relatively small part, however, of 
</p>
<p>the full proton-proton interaction at energies high enough that the protons are far 
</p>
<p>above the proton-proton Coulomb barrier for r ::::: lfermi.) It is useful to introduce 
</p>
<p>the isospin formalism and consider the neutron and proton as the two possible 
</p>
<p>charge states of a nucleon. Being a spin s = 4 particle, the nucleon is a fermion. 
Besides the internal degree of freedom associated with the spin of the nucleon, 
</p>
<p>another internal degree of freedom is associated with the charge of the nucleon. 
</p>
<p>Thus, the wave function associated with the internal degrees of freedom of our 
</p>
<p>point nucleon must include besides the spin function, X(u)m" with two quantum 
</p>
<p>states, ms = +4 and ms = -4, a similar charge function, also with two quantum 
states. Even though nothing is "spinning" in this charge space, we can use the 
</p>
<p>mathematics of a system with two internal quantum states to make a one-to-one 
</p>
<p>parallel between the two-spin state system and the two-charge state system. We 
</p>
<p>therefore can name the neutron as the state of the system with a new spin, the 
</p>
<p>"isospin," with a new quantum number with value + 4, whereas the proton is the 
state of the system for which the new quantum number has the value - 4. We 
introduce the isospin vector operator 7 in analogy with s. Just as it is useful to </p>

</p>
<p>introduce iT via s = !iT, we now let 7 = ! i, where 
</p>
<p>izlneutron) = !Tzlneutron) = +!Ineutron) = +!Imi = +~) 
izlproton) = ~Tzlproton) = -~Iproton} = -!Imi = -~}. (1) 
</p>
<p>(Note: It is of course quite arbitrary as to whether a neutron or proton is designated 
</p>
<p>as the mi = + ~ particle. This is illustrated by the fact that nuclear physicists and 
</p>
<p>particle physicists do not agree on this choice. The above is the nuclear convention. 
</p>
<p>Particle physicists name the proton the mi = +! particle.) In analogy with the 
</p>
<p>operators, iT, we can introduce the operators i, with 
</p>
<p>Now, just as the operator s+ = ~(ax + iay), when acting on a state with ms = - ~ 
converts it to a state with ms = +!, so the operator i+ = ~(Tx + iTy), when acting 
on a proton state with mi = - ~ converts it to a neutron state with mi = + ~. This 
</p>
<p>operator is needed in the theory of beta-decay, where a proton may be converted 
</p>
<p>to a neutron. 
</p>
<p>Just as we found it convenient to write spin functions in terms of internal vari-
</p>
<p>ables, ~ == iT, namely. X(iT)m" we will now write the internal charge functions in 
terms of the internal variable designated by i, namely, X(i)m;' This will be par-
ticularly useful for a discussion of the symmetry of two-particle functions. For the 
</p>
<p>two-particle spin functions, it was convenient to make a transformation from the 
</p>
<p>two-particle functions in the m s.,ms ,2 representation to the SMs representation, 
</p>
<p>via 
</p>
<p>x (iTdm,.l x (iT2 )m, 2 = ~)tms,' ~mdSMs)x(iT" iT2)sMs, (3) 
s 
</p>
<p>where the three functions with S = I, Ms = +1,0, -1 are symmetric under the 
interchange of indices 1 and 2 of the two fermions, whereas the single function 
</p>
<p>with S = 0 and M s = 0 is antisymmetric (changes sign) under interchange of the 
</p>
<p>indices 1 and 2. In the same fashion. the charge function for two neutrons, for two 
</p>
<p>protons, and one linear combination of the neutron-proton function are symmetric 
</p>
<p>under the interchange of the indices 1 and 2 of the two-particle charge functions, 
</p>
<p>and can be considered members of a triplet with two-particle quantum numbers, 
</p>
<p>I = I, with M/ = +1, -1, O. where 1 = 7, + 72 [in analogy with S = s, + S2, 
with the same vector-coupling (or Clebsch-Gordan coefficients) in isospin space 
</p>
<p>as in ordinary spin space.] Thus,

</p>
<p>For nucleon-nucleon scattering, therefore, the total two-particle function can be 
</p>
<p>considered a product of a relative motion orbital function, a two-particle spin 
</p>
<p>function, and a two-particle charge function 
</p>
<p>'I/Itotal = 'I/Iorbital{71 - 72)X{O\, a2h.MsX{ih i 2)I,M/. (6) 
</p>
<p>Because the s = t nucleons are fermions, this total wave function must be anti-
symmetric under interchange of particle indices. In a partial wave decomposition 
</p>
<p>where the orbital functions with even 1 do not change sign under the rl # 7Z inter-
change and the orbital functions with odd 1 do change sign, the partial waves with 
</p>
<p>even 1 are therefore restricted to terms with S = I, I = 0, or with S = 0, I = 1, 
</p>
<p>whereas the partial waves with odd 1 are restricted to terms with S = 1, I = 1 
</p>
<p>or with S = 0, I = O. The scattering amplitude matrix must now be designated 
by the initial ms and the initial mi quantum numbers of the two particles in the 
</p>
<p>incident beam, and the final m~ and m; of the two particles in the scattered beam, 
that is, the scattering amplitude matrix, will be of the form 
</p>
<p>To take account of the required anti symmetry of the two-particle wave function in 
</p>
<p>a partial wave decomposition, however, it will be necessary to transform from the 
</p>
<p>ms,lms,2mj,lmj,2 basis into an S, Ms, I, MI basis (via standard and very simple 
</p>
<p>Clebsch-Gordan coefficients), and expand the scattering amplitUde in partial waves

</p>
<p>to be able to observe the S, I value restrictions for even and odd I. In addition, the 
</p>
<p>dominant part of the nucleon-nucleon interaction has terms of the form 
</p>
<p>V = Vo{r) + VI{r){al . (2) + V2{r)(il . i 2) + V3(r)(aj . (72)(il . i 2), (7) 
</p>
<p>wherer = 171 -721. The four terms of this potential are scalars separately in orbital 
</p>
<p>space, in spin space, and in isospin space. Hence, they cannot induce a change in 
</p>
<p>the total spin quantum number S or the total isospin quantum number I. Thus, the 
</p>
<p>above f -scattering amplitude matrix must be diagonal in S and I, i.e., Sf = S and 
If = I. 
</p>

<p>The isospin quantum number also plays an important role in the energy level 
</p>
<p>scheme of nuclei. Let us consider briefly two-valence nucleon nuclei with mass

<p>number, A = 18, that is, the nuclei l~OlO, J~F9, and 1~Ne8, which have two-
valence shell nucleons outside the doubly magic nucleus, I~ Og, two neutrons for </p>

</p>
<p>nuclei have M [ = + I, 0, and -1, respectively. All three nuclei have states with 
I = 1. In addition, I~F9 has states with I = O. Thus, we are dealing with isospin 
triplets and an isospin singlet of energy levels. The total Coulomb energy separates 
</p>
<p>the energy levels of the triplet. It is, however, easy to make an average Coulomb

<p>energy correction by considering the 8, 9, or 10 proton cloud as a spherically sym-
</p>
<p>metric charge cloud of the experimentally observed radius. Because the greatest 
</p>
<p>Coulomb repulsion occurs in l~N e8 with its 10 protons, the levels of this nucleus 
</p>
<p>should be shifted down by 3.40 MeV to put them into correspondence with the 
</p>
<p>companion levels in I~F9. Similarly, the smaller Coulomb repUlsion in 1~01O re-
</p>
<p>quires an upward shift of 2.70 MeV. With these shifts, the members of the I = I 
</p>
<p>triplet at once become apparent. The lowest levels in both 1~ 010 and 19N es are 
0+,2+, 4+, 0+,2+, and 1-. The required companion levels are also found in the 
</p>
<p>M[ = 0 nucleus, I~F9' The 2+ level lies at 1.98,2.02, and 1.89 MeV above the 
</p>
<p>0+ level in these three nuclei. Similarly, the 4+ level lies at 3.55, 3.61, and 3.38 
</p>
<p>MeV above the 0+ level. For the approximate triplet nature of the other excited 
</p>
<p>states, see Fig. 56.1. Moreover, these are the levels predicted by the nuclear shell 
</p>
<p>model. The lowest states are those in which the two-valence nucleons are both in 
</p>
<p>a 2d~ single particle state, with the same principal quantum number, n = 2, and 
2 
</p>
<p>orbital angular-momentum quantum number, I = 2, coupled to j = ~. For such 
a two-particle configuration, states with J even, J = 0, 2, 4, are anti symmetric in 
</p>
<p>the combined spin-orbital part of the space, and hence must be symmetric in the 
</p>
<p>isospin-space part of the two-nucleon wave function. Hence, this is restricted to 
</p>
<p>I = 1. The states of this configuration, with J odd, J = 1,3,5, are symmetric 
in the combined spin-orbital part of the full space, and must be antisymmetric 
</p>
<p>in the isospin part of the space. Hence, such states are restricted to two-particle 
</p>
<p>isospin quantum number, I = 0, and can occur only in the M[ = 0 member of 
the triplet, I~F9. In fact, the 1+ state is the ground state of I~F9. The 3+ state also 
</p>
<p>lies below the lowest 0+ state in this nucleus. The remaining I = 0 states in this 
nucleus have mainly positive parity for odd J, and negative parity for even J, just 
</p>
<p>the opposite of the low-lying states with I = 1, which have positive parity for 
</p>
<p>even J and negative parity for odd J, a strong indication they have the opposite 
</p>
<p>symmetry in the combined orbital-spin part of the full space. (Note, however, two-
</p>
<p>nucleon configurations such as 2s 1 2d ~, with different single-particle l's can have 
</p>
<p>both (orbital-spin) symmetric and2antlsymmetric combinations, so they can have 
</p>
<p>both I = 0 and I = l. The 2+ level at 2.52-MeV excitation energy in ~8 F9 with 
I = 0 is such a level. Although the isospin quantum number in nuclei is only an 
approximately good quantum number (largely because of the additional Coulomb 
</p>
<p>force between protons), Fig. 56.1 gives a clear indication of the importance of the 
</p>
<p>isospin quantum number in nuclei. </p>

<p>B Application: The First Born Approximation of

<p>Scattering Theory Revisited 
</p>
<p>As a first simple test of our result, let us rederive the differential cross section for 
</p>
<p>the scattering of a point projectile from a point target particle interacting via a 
</p>
<p>potential that is weak compared with the kinetic energy of the relative motion. The 
</p>

<p>H = Ho + V(r), where now V = )"'h, (33)

<p>(35) 
</p>
<p>With this normalization, the unit operator is f dklk}(kI. and the scalar product 
(k'lk) = lJ(k - k') has the standard Dirac delta function form. The number of 
states in this continuum between k and k + dk is then given by the volume element 
</p>
<p>dkxdkydkz = edk sin Okd(hdrPk. 
</p>
<p>where k is the magnitude of k, and Ok. rPk give the direction of k. This must now 
be transformed to the form p(E I )d E J, so we can use Golden Rule II. From

<p>where dQ J is the element of solid angle about the direction of the scattering vector

</p>

<p>It may be useful to show that the first Born approximation result also follows

</p>
<p>Here, j is the relevant dimensionless angular momentum vector. For an electron 
or a proton, we can use the Pauli a operator, j = !a. For a free electron the g 
factor is gs = 2 (neglecting quantum electrodynamic corrections). This g factor 
may also be slightly modified because of the electron environment in a molecular 
</p>
<p>or crystalline system. For the proton, the g factor is "anomalous" gs = 2(2.793). 
</p>
<p>The relevant energies for electron and proton magnetic resonance experiments are

<p>so these are small perturbations for atomic or molecular systems. 
</p>
<p>In a typical magnetic resonance experiment, two magnetic fields are used: 
</p>
<p>(1) A steady, time-independent, B-field, Bo, where this field will be chosen to 
lie in the z direction, withliw(Bo} = liwo. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>554 58. Oscillating Magnetic Fields: Magnetic Resonance 
</p>
<p>(2) A perpendicular B -field, oscillating with circular frequency, w, and strength, 
</p>
<p>BI , where we define WI via Iiw(Bd = Iiwl. This field is often linearly polarized in 
the x direction, or circularly polarized in the x-y plane. Because we can make a 
</p>
<p>linearly polarized field from a superposition of a right and left circularly polarized 
</p>
<p>field, we shall treat only the case of a right circularly polarized oscillating 81- field 
(see Fig. 58.1) and choose our Hamiltonian as 
</p>
<p>H = Ho - [liwoJz +liwl (Jx cos wt + Jy sin wt)]

</p>
<p>where h = (Jx &plusmn; i Jy ). Our earlier perturbation theory for an oscillating field can 
now be used, if WI &laquo; wo, so we can include the steady field part of the Hamiltonian 
as part of our zeroth-order problem. [Note, in this case, h(O)T =f:. h(O).] Ifwe choose 
</p>
<p>the electron-resonance case for which the ms = +~ level lies above the ms = - ~

<p>In this perturbation approach, the parameter of smallness is wt/(Iwol - w). The

<p>for an s = ~-system, assuming we have an initial state that is an eigenstate of Sz, 
with ms = +~, or ms = -4. In an actual magnetic-resonance experiment, we 
have a system of many s = ~ particles with different population probabilities for 
</p>
<p>the states with ms = &plusmn;~. It will therefore again be advantageous to use a density

<p>matrix formulation. Suppose first the initial state at t = 0 is a linear combination 
of the eigenstates Im s }, given by

<p>Now, we define a magnetization vector (in place of a polarization vector, bearing

<p>Sudden and Adiabatic Approximations 
</p>
<p>So far, we have considered only time-independent and periodic time-dependent 
</p>
<p>perturbations. One of the common time-dependent problems in quantum mechan-
</p>
<p>ics involves the turning on or off of a perturbing term, e.g., an external field. In 
</p>
<p>general, the details of turning on or off of time-dependent perturbations are too 
</p>
<p>difficult to solve. Two limiting cases exist, however, that are both important and 
</p>
<p>that can be treated in detail with good accuracy: the sudden and the adiabatic 
</p>
<p>approximations. 
</p>
<p>Consider a perturbation problem, with 
</p>
<p>H = Ho+ V, (1) 
</p>
<p>where the perturbation, V, is off up to some time to and is then turned on, so at 
</p>
<p>some later time, t, with t - to = T the perturbation is on at full strength. In the 
limit for which T ~ 0, we have the sudden approximation. In the limit T ~ 00, 
</p>
<p>we have the adiabatic approximation. 
</p>
<p>A Sudden Approximation 
</p>
<p>We shall introduce the variable 
</p>
<p>(t - to) 
s=---
</p>
<p>T 
</p>
<p>such that the perturbation is off for s = 0 and is on at full strength for s = I. With

<p>The perturbation is so sudden the quantum system cannot follow. The system stays

</p>
<p>such a sudden perturbation occurs in the beta decay of an atomic nucleus. An

<p>value of the rest mass of the neutrino. The endpoint electrons are of particular

<p>the exact atomic energy of the recoiling ~He, one-electron ion must be taken into 
</p>
<p>account carefully. The original one-electron tritium atom had its atomic electron 
</p>
<p>in an Is ground state for this Z = I nucleus. The beta decay end point energy 
</p>
<p>is 18.65 keY. The e~ emitted in this beta decay traverses the atomic dimension 
</p>
<p>so rapidly the original atomic electron will still have the wave function of an Is 
</p>
<p>Z = 1 atom, even though it now finds itself in the Coulomb field of a Z = 2 
nucleus. This state at t - to will thus be a linear combination of one-electron states 
</p>
<p>In I = 0 m = O} of a Z = 2 one-electron ion, and the probability for all values of

<p>B Adiabatic Approximation: An Example: The Reversal 
</p>
<p>of the Magnetic Field in a One-Electron Atom 
</p>
<p>As a second example, let us consider a one-electron atom in an external magnetic 
</p>
<p>field reversed from a value, + Bo, to a value, - Bo, in a time interval, T. We shall 
consider both the sudden approximation, T --+ 0, and the adiabatic approximation, 
</p>
<p>T --+ 00, in particular, the latter, adiabatic case, in which we have to carry out some 
</p>
<p>analysis. For simplicity, we will consider the Paschen-Back and Zeeman spectrum 
</p>
<p>of an alkali atom, such as Na, to avoid the higher degeneracies of the hydrogen 
</p>
<p>spectrum. The perturbing Hamiltonian consists of the external magnetic-field term 
</p>
<p>and the internal magnetic-field spin-orbit term (see Chapter 26).

</p>
<p>have chosen a slightly more complicated function of the time. In the limits, T ~ 0, 
</p>
<p>or, T ~ 00, however, the exact form of the time variation is unimportant. Fig. 
</p>
<p>59.2 shows the energy level splitting for an I = I six-fold degenerate level, such as 
</p>
<p>the 3 p level in N a, as a function of Bo for both positive and negative values of Bo, 
</p>
<p>starting with the huge-field or Paschen-Back case (for positive Bz on the right of 
</p>
<p>the diagram, and for negative values of Bz on the left of the diagram). The above 
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian leads to a matrix in the Im/ms} scheme, diagonal in mj = m/ + ms, 
and, except for the two states with m j = &plusmn;(l + ~), the above Hamiltonian leads 
to 2 x 2 submatrices with fixed m j of the form (see Chapter 26) 
</p>
<p>where ml = m j =F ~ for the states with ms = &plusmn;1. This Hamiltonian submatrix, 
with rows and columns specified by ms = &plusmn;4, can be written in terms of a 2 x 2 
unit matrix and the Pauli a matrices, via 
</p>
<p>r 2t f3] [IiWL(O) 2t f3m j] 
H = LliwL(O)(1 - T )mj -"4 1 + -2-(1 - T) + -2- az

<p>+ ~J((l + 1)2 - m]] ax 
= aCt)1 + b(t)az + Cax 
= (ao + alt)1 + (bo + bjt)az + Cax &bull; (6) 
</p>
<p>For the two levels with mj = &plusmn;(l + ~), the state vectors, 1m/ = +1, ms = +~) 
and 1m/ = -I, ms = -~}, are eigenvectors of our H for all values of Bz and 
</p>
<p>independent of the time. For these two special states, therefore, U(t, 0) = 1, for 
</p>
<p>all values of the switching time, T. For all other values of m j' however, the results 
</p>
<p>of the sudden switching are different from those of the adiabatic case. For example, 
</p>
<p>if the one-electron system is in the second-highest energy state, with asymptotic 
</p>
<p>quantumnumbersm/ = 0, ms = +~ in thehuge-fieldlimitattime,t = O,asudden 
</p>
<p>switching of the direction of the B-field to reverse the direction of B will leave 
the one-electron atom in a state with m/ = 0, ms = +~, but for negative Ho, this 
</p>
<p>is now the second-lowest energy state. In the extremely short time of the sudden 
</p>
<p>switching of B-field direction, the one-electron atom has jumped over the energy 
</p>
<p>gap between the P&gt;' and p 1 levels at field strength zero to end in the second-lowest 
</p>
<p>energy state. That is, the ohe-electron atom initially in the upper of the two energy 
eigenstates with m j = + 4 will in the sudden process end in the lower of the two 
energy eigenstates with m j = + ~ . 
</p>
<p>Conversely, ifthe direction of the B -field is reversed very slowly (in the adiabatic 
limit for which T ---* 00), we shall show the one-electron system follows the 
</p>
<p>second-highest energy level with m j = +~ through the zero B-field p&gt;. level and 
2 
</p>
<p>then follows the m j = +! level to the huge negative Hz-field limit with asymptotic 
quantum numbers m{ = +1, ms = -~. That is, we shall show the one-electron </p>

<p>Interaction of Electromagnetic 
</p>
<p>Radiation with Atomic Systems 
</p>
<p>So far, we have considered quantum systems in external oscillating magnetic (or 
</p>
<p>electric) fields, where the perturbing fields were considered as classical oscillating 
</p>
<p>fields. This approach would permit us to study induced absorption or emission 
</p>
<p>processes in an atomic system, particularly if the intensity of the electromagnetic 
</p>
<p>fields is such that the density of photons is very great in the region of interest. To 
</p>
<p>study processes involving a small number of photons interacting with an atomic 
</p>
<p>system, we must first quantize the electromagnetic or radiation field itself. So far, 
</p>
<p>our time-dependent perturbation theory would not permit us to study the spon-
</p>
<p>taneous emission of photons by an atomic system, Le., a situation in which the 
</p>
<p>initial state consists of an atom in an excited state and no photons, and the final 
</p>
<p>state is the atom in a lower state (perhaps the ground state) and one photon of the 
</p>
<p>appropriate energy. In order to treat this problem rigorously, we need to quantize 
</p>
<p>the radiation field.

derived from a vector and a scalar potential, A and CP. For our purposes, it will be

<p>such as the Coulomb repulsion electron-electron potential teqns and the Coulomb

<p>where this follows from the orthonormality of the unit vectors, (e" * .ef1) = 8v/1' the 
orthonormality of the spherical harmonics, and the orthonormality of the Clebsch~

<p>Gordan coefficients. [Note, in particular: When spherical components are used for 
</p>
<p>the unit vectors, e, we must take the scalar product of a starred with an unstarred 
spherical component, (e l' * . e/1) (not (e" . e/1))' to get a Kronecker delta in the two

<p>The Emission of Photons by Atoms:

<p>For an atomic system, we can expect the quantity, k . r;, to be very small:

</p>
<p>k I - A ao 6,000 x (1O)-8cm ( ) , 
</p>
<p>assuming the photon is in the visible part of the spectrum. For such a system, we

nuclear system. For a nucleus,

</p>
<p>so, for a heavy nucleus, with Rnucleus ~ 10 fermi and emitted y photon of energy 
</p>
<p>2 MeV, we would have kr; ~ (10)-1, still small, but now large enough so higher 
</p>
<p>order terms in the expansion in powers of kr; become important. This will be 
</p>
<p>particularly true for transitions between low-lying states in a nucleus that often 
</p>
<p>have the same parity so the zeroth-order term will lead to electric dipole matrix 
</p>
<p>elements that are rigorously zero because of parity selection rules. In such a system 
</p>
<p>then, we will find it advantageous to make full use of the expansion of A-L in vector 
spherical harmonics. With the full expansion, we will get higher order electric 
</p>
<p>and magnetic multipole moment matrix elements. For the atomic case, however, 
</p>
<p>where the zeroth-order term dominates, we can dispense with the vector spherical 
</p>
<p>harmonic formalism. In this case (as we shall see), the atomic transition probability 
</p>
<p>matrix elements will involve only matrix elements of the atomic electric dipole

</p>
<p>As our second example, let us calculate the cross section for the photoelectric 
</p>
<p>effect for an atom. For simplicity, we will choose the simplest atom, hydrogen. 
</p>
<p>We assume we have an incoming beam of photons of definite k, hence definite 
energy, Fiw, and definite polarization. We also assume the incident photon beam 
</p>
<p>is linearly polarized, with polarization in the direction of ea , and Fiw is greater 
than the ionization energy of hydrogen, ({J.Le4)j('lJi2). Therefore, when a photon of 
</p>
<p>energy Fiw is absorbed, the hydrogen atom makes a transition from the Is ground 
</p>
<p>state into the continuum, (see Fig. 64.1). For simplicity, let us further assume 
</p>
<p>Fiw &raquo; (J.Le 4)j('lJi2) so the final electron kinetic energy p}j2J.L is large enough the 
final electron continuum wave function can be approximated by a plane wave.

<p>cannot proceed via the electric dipole term (cf., problems 32. and 31.), because the

</p>
<p>Show that only the spin terms of the magnetic dipole operator can contribute

because the orbital wave functions for two S = 1 states at different energies (one 
the bound state, the second the relative motion function in the continuum) must 
</p>
<p>be orthogonal to each other*, show that the magnetic dipole operator has zero

</p>
<p>Because we start with a photon of type kJ-t and end with a photon of type k' J-t',

</p>
<p>Because of the difficulty of performing the intermediate state sum in the factors, 
</p>
<p>gml1-' needed to evaluate the scattering cross sections from the underlying atomic

<p>measurable quantities. We want to investigate the possibility these sums can be 
</p>
<p>estimated from other physically measurable quantities. 
</p>
<p>So far, we have found it convenient to express the differential and total cross 
</p>
<p>sections in terms of the circular polarizations of the incident and scattered photons. 
</p>
<p>In terms of these, we had

<p>where the gml1- are given in terms of spherical components of the electric dipole

</p>
<p>With Wi = w, these expressions are valid for the elastic processes. Also, for w and 
Wi not necessarily very small, the gml1- are w-dependent quantities. Because atoms 
</p>
<p>(unlike molecules) are spherically symmetric systems. which in general have all 
</p>

<p>we could have averaged over all possible orientations of the atom, leading to

<p>Because we consider a world made of atomic systems and electromagnetic fields,

<p>atomic bound states with zero photons present, Le., states such as IAIlO), but also

<p>the coupling between atoms and photons is weak, states with two photons, such

<p>as IAn", k/1-, k' /1-'), may be negligible in dominant order of perturbation theory, 
although they may also play a role, particularly for systems for which selection

</p>
<p>with the s~stem where the atom is in the ground state and the photon has energy,

system composed of the atom in the second excited state and with photon energy,

<p>To gain information about the molecular polarizabilities, a1- and all, the polar-
</p>
<p>izations of the scattered photons are measured, usually in an arrangement with 
</p>
<p>()' = I' &cent;' = 0, i.e., scattered photon in the x direction, incident photon in the z 
direction. For this arrangement, show the "degree of polarization" (dall / da 1-) has 
</p>
<p>the value 
</p>
<p>for the case when the incident light is polarized in the y direction and 
</p>
<p>for the case of unpolarized incident light. 
</p>
<p>Note that you have to average over all possible molecular orientations. 
</p>
<p>In the above, dall gives the scattering cross section for the scattered photons 
</p>
<p>polarized parallel to the scattering plane, defined by the vectors k of the incident 
beam and k' of the scattered beam; i.e., in our arrangement, dall is for the scattered 
photon polarized in the z direction. d a 1- gives the scattering cross section for the 
</p>
<p>scattered photon polarized perpendicular to the scattering plane; therefore, in our 
</p>
<p>arrangement, da 1- is for the scattered photon polarized in the y direction. 
</p>
<p>41. For the Raman scattering from diatomic molecules involving rotational ex-
</p>
<p>citations, the gfJ'y of problem 40. can be replaced by the rotational matrix elements

</p>

<p>inertia of the diatomic molecule in its equilibrium configuration, Ie = JU;. 
Calculate the cross sections, dall and da1-, as functions of a1- and all, again, 
</p>
<p>for the special case, ()' = I, &cent;' = 0, as in problem 40, i.e., scattered photon in 
the x direction, incident photon in the z direction. Assume unpolarized incident 
</p>
<p>light. Calculate these cross sections for both the so-called Stokes process, where 
</p>
<p>the molecule absorbs energy (transition J ~ J + 2), so hw' &lt; hw, and the 
anti-Stokes process (transition J ~ J - 2), so hw' &gt; hw. Prove only Raman 
</p>
<p>transitions with ~ J = &plusmn;2 can occur; keeping in mind transitions with ~ J = &deg; 
lead to elastic scattering processes. 
</p>
<p>Raman scattering is particularly important in homonuclear diatomic molecules, 
</p>
<p>such as H2 and N2, which have no permanent electric dipole moments and hence no 
</p>
<p>rotational absorption spectra. Also, the differential cross section for each Raman

</p>
<p>C Dirac's Reasoning: Historical Approach 
</p>
<p>Because of the seeming difficulty with the Klein-Gordon equation, Dirac looked 
</p>
<p>for an alternative. He assumed the basic equations might be first order in both space </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>C Dirac's Reasoning: Historical Approach 659 
</p>
<p>and time derivatives, so ct and x, y, z, appear on an equal footing. He was guided 
</p>
<p>by Maxwell's equations, which are Lorentz-covariant and first order in time and 
</p>
<p>space derivatives, but involve not one scalar field, 1lJ, but six fields, E 1, E2 , E3, B1, 
</p>
<p>B2 , BJ, connected by six of the equations. He, therefore, postulated the relativistic 
</p>
<p>equations have N fields, 1/r p, with p = 1, ... , N, such that 
</p>
<p>N 
</p>
<p>1. W = LI1/rpI2 , (7) 
p=l 
</p>
<p>leading to a positive-definite probability density. In addition, he assumed the ba-
</p>
<p>sic equations are first-order equations, and the Klein-Gordon equation is then a 
</p>
<p>consequence of these first -order equations, where, with p = 1, ... , N,

</p>

</p>
<p>equation follows and the probability interpretation is a valid one. 
</p>

<p>it might seem tempting to conclude the ylL are the four components of a four-vector

<p>contracted with a/axl" to make a Lorentz scalar, but this is nonsense. The yl" are 
merely matrices, introduced to keep track of how the various components, 1/f P' are 
coupled to each other in the four equations. If an observer, 0', in another Lorentz 
</p>
<p>frame, X'll, constructs his Dirac equations, his yl" will have to satisfy all of the 
</p>
<p>same criteria as the yiL for an observer, 0, in the Lorentz frame, Xll . Observer, 0', 
</p>
<p>might come up with a different solution to the Dirac relations and the hermiticity

<p>conditions (as might another observer in Xl'), but his different solution would be

</p>
<p>Because the S for proper Lorentz transformations are built from exponentials of

<p>Before a further investigation of the physical significance of the solutions with

<p>r = 1, 2 (to find their relationship to electron spin), let us first use these plane wave 
solutions in our first application. Let us calculate the differential scattering cross 
</p>
<p>section of a relativistic electron from a nucleus of charge Ze. The interaction will 
</p>
<p>be the Coulomb potential, but, as in our corresponding nonrelativistic calculation, 
</p>
<p>we will have to use a screened Coulomb potential and let the screening parameter 
</p>
<p>~ O. (Compare with Chapter 46.) This is quite realistic because the real target 
</p>
<p>will undoubtedly be made of atoms, where the nucleus of charge, Ze, is imbedded 
</p>
<p>in the atomic electron cloud. Also, for relativistic electrons, we would expect the 
</p>
<p>plane wave Born approximation to be good because now E &raquo; Ze2 /rnucleus.

<p>Pauli Approximation to the Dirac

<p>In the last chapter, we examined the extreme nonrelativistic limit of the Dirac

1/1 A ---+ 1/ISchroedinger, the two components of 1/1 A being related to the two spin 
components of the electron, whereas the third and fourth components, in the form

<p>of 1/1 B, were smaller by a factor of order p / me. We now want to carry this one step 
further following an approach first carried through by Pauli. Again, let

<p>The Klein Paradox: An Example from 
</p>
<p>the History of Negative Energy State 
Difficulties: The Positron Interpretation 
</p>
<p>One of the simplest problems, first solved in the earliest days of the Dirac theory, is 
</p>
<p>the I-D motion of a free particle reflected or transmitted at a discrete potential step. 
</p>
<p>Suppose the particle moves in the z direction under the influence of a potential 
</p>
<p>such that 
</p>
<p>V(z) = 0 for z &lt; 0, V(z) = +Vo for z &gt; 0, (1) 
</p>
<p>where we assume, Vo &gt; O. The solution will be independent of the spin of the 
</p>
<p>electron. Let us therefore choose an electron with spin projection in the + z direc-
tion. We shall choose a positive-energy solution. In region I, for z &lt; 0, we expect 
</p>
<p>plane waves moving both to the left and to the right. Therefore, for z ::: 0,

</p>
<p>with E &gt; 0, and p = +JC;: - m2e2 ), where A gives the amplitude of the 
incident wave traveling to the right, and B gives the amplitude of the reflected 
</p>
<p>wave traveling to the left. From Sz = eo/ t a z 0/. we have

<p>Now, at the boundary, z = 0, the continuity of both the probability density and the 
</p>
<p>probability current density, S?, are satisfied by the continuity of 1/1, but now this 
means all components of 1/1. Therefore, this requires

<p>In particular, for vic = .,ff, and therefore E = 1.1547me2 , the transmission 
coefficient is T = .83. Klein of course expected no transmission and complete 
reflection in the limit of large potential barrier Yo. This "Klein Paradox" and 
</p>
<p>similarly paradoxical situations bothered physicists in the earliest days of Dirac 
</p>
<p>theory. Dirac came up with the solution: In the normal vacuum, all negative-energy 
</p>
<p>states are completely filled. However, if one electron is taken out of a normally 
</p>
<p>filled negative-energy state, the missing electron, a hole in the normally filled 
</p>
<p>negative-energy sea, makes for a missing charge in a normally electrically neutral 
</p>
<p>vacuum and thus behaves like a particle of charge +14 In this way, Dirac was led 
to the prediction of the existence of the positron. 
</p>
<p>A Modem Hole Analysis of the Klein Barrier Reflection 
</p>
<p>According to Dirac's final interpretation, the Klein experiment must be understood 
</p>
<p>in the following way. In region I, for z &lt; 0, an electron with positive energy </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>696 75. Klein Paradox: Example: Positron Interpretation 
</p>
<p>E = +J (m2e4 + e2 p2) is placed in a level normally empty. However, if this E is 
such that E &lt; Vo - me2 , in region II, for z &gt; 0, all such levels are normally filled. 
</p>
<p>The normal vacuum in this region thus consists of an infinite number of filled states 
</p>
<p>with E negative relative to the reference energy Vo, with E &lt; Vo - me2 &bull; Now, if 
</p>
<p>an electron from the beam in region I reaches the potential barrier at z = 0, it can 
knock an electron out of this filled sea, creating a hole in this negative-energy sea. 
</p>
<p>This hole at z = 0, however, can be filled by an electron at z &gt; 0 with the same 
energy. When this electron has moved into the hole at z = 0, the hole at z &gt; 0 
can be filled by another electron with this same E but at still greater values of z. 
Thus, an electron current from right to left exists, i.e., in a direction such that Sz 
</p>
<p>is negative. Thus, with 
</p>
<p>2ep 2 
S - lei and with (E - V.O + me2) &lt; 0, (18) 
</p>
<p>z - (E - Vo + me2 ) , 
</p>
<p>we need the positive root for p; that is, 
</p>
<p>ep = +J(Vo - E + me2 )(Vo - E - me2 ), 
</p>
<p>ep 
so =-
</p>
<p>(E - Vo +me2 ) 
</p>
<p>(Vo - E +me2 ) 
</p>
<p>(Vo - E -me2 )' 
</p>
<p>Substituting this equation into eq. (11), we get 
</p>
<p>R = [ 
_1_+---.:-,=( "'=O-=E=+=m=c::;:')=(E=+=m=c:;;=') ] 2 (Vo E-mc')(E mc') 
</p>
<p>1 (Vo-E+mc2 )(E+mc2 )' 
- (Vo-E-mc2)(E-mc2) 
</p>
<p>Now, in the limit, Vo -+ 00, we have 
</p>
<p>[
1 + (E-"~C,)]2 _ E +ep 1 
</p>
<p>R -+ cp - &gt; . 
1 - (E-mc') E - ep 
</p>
<p>(19) 
</p>
<p>(20) 
</p>
<p>(21) 
</p>
<p>This reflection coefficient is now greater than unity because the electrons knocked 
</p>
<p>out of the filled negative-energy sea at z = 0 can join the electrons reflected at 
the barrier, so the number of electrons in the reflected beam is greater than the 
</p>
<p>number of electrons in the incident beam. In region II, however, for every electron 
</p>
<p>that has joined the incident electrons in the reflected beam, there is a hole moving 
</p>
<p>to the right. This appears to us like a positron moving to the right in region II. 
</p>
<p>The electron current in region II, however, is from right to left, as electrons from 
</p>
<p>further to the right fill holes to the left. Note, in particular, for vic = If, 
. ./2+ 1 
</p>
<p>hm R = M = 5.8. 
Vo ..... "" ",2 - 1 
</p>
<p>(22) 
</p>
<p>Before justifying this perhaps surprisingly large number, a remark about sharp 
</p>
<p>potential rises is in order. Our potential rises sharply from a value of zero to a 
</p>
<p>large value at z = O. This idealization of a realistic potential rise would be a good 
approximation if the actual distance, d, over which the rise occurs (see Fig. 75.2) </p>

</p>
<p>This result would be hard to achieve in a realistic setup!! In an actual experimental 
</p>
<p>setup, the potential rise would look more like that shown in Fig. 75.2. Now, for an 
</p>
<p>energy E, such that E + me2 &lt; Vo, we need to consider three regions. In region 
I, we have the situation of case 1, considered above; i.e., V(z) &lt; E-- me2 . In 
</p>
<p>region II between the points Z = la and l = lb, we have case 3, considered above; 
i.e., E - me2 &lt; V (z) &lt; E + me2 &bull; In region II, therefore, p(z) is pure imaginary. 
An exponential falloff with Z exists in the wave function, starting at Z = Za and 
</p>
<p>ending at Z = lb. In region III, with z &gt; Zb, we have case 4, considered above. 
Here, we have oscillatory solutions, with holes (positrons) traveling to the right, 
</p>
<p>but with an electron current to the left. Before the electrons knocked out of the 
</p>
<p>filled negative-energy sea for z &gt; lb can reach to region I to join the reflected 
</p>

<p>Exact Solutions for the Dirac Equation 
</p>
<p>for Spherically Symmetric Potentials 
</p>
<p>Having discussed the plane-wave solutions to the Dirac equation in some detail, 
</p>
<p>let us now look at solutions to the Dirac equation with a spherically symmetric 
</p>
<p>V (r). In particular, two cases are of special interest as follows.

<p>Case 1.

</p>
<p>The hydrogenic atom is of particular interest, especially for inner atomic shells in 
</p>
<p>a high Z atom, where relativistic effects may become important (e.g., in K -shell 
</p>
<p>or L-shell X-ray spectra). 
</p>
<p>Case 2. 
</p>
<p>The quark model with V (r) = 0 for r &lt; a, 
</p>
<p>and boundary conditions at r = a such that the quarks are confined to the spherical 
region with r &lt; a. (Note: Our discussion of the Klein paradox indicates this 
</p>
<p>confinement might not be achievable with a potential that is 00 for r &gt; a.) This 
</p>
<p>quark model is known as the MIT Bag model. 
</p>
<p>Let us first look at the general case of the Dirac equation with a spherically

simultaneously, and the eigenvalues of H will have good j, and m j. (We use the 
</p>

we further use the fact that yO commutes with L j, the second term can be evaluated 
</p>
<p>through

<p>The MIT Bag Model: The Dirac 
Equation for a Quark Confined to a 
Spherical Region 
</p>
<p>Quarks, like the leptons (electrons, f.-L and r mesons) are Dirac s = 1 particles. 
Unlike the leptons, quarks have additional internal degrees of freedom, specified 
</p>
<p>by "flavor" (including isospin that determines their charge) and "color." They come 
</p>
<p>in three colors and three generations of isospin doublets (u, d; up and down quarks; 
</p>
<p>s, c; strange and charmed quarks; and b, t; bottom and top quarks). They appear 
</p>
<p>in nature only in "colorless" combinations corresponding to the scalar irreducible 
</p>
<p>representations of the color symmetry SU(3) [the analogue of S = 0 multiparticle 
</p>
<p>spin states, corresponding to the scalar irreducible representations of SU(2)]. The 
</p>
<p>"colorless" combinations can arise either from quark-antiquark combinations or 
</p>
<p>combinations of three quarks. Protons, e.g., are made of two up quarks, each with 
</p>
<p>charge of +te, and one down quark with charge -te, whereas neutrons are made 
of one up quark and two down quarks, total charge = (+ ~ - t -- t)e = O. These 
three-quark systems have a total spin, S = 1, and isospin, I = 1, with M/ = &plusmn;~. 
The quark aggregates are confined to finite regions of space, for the three-quark 
</p>
<p>aggregates of the nucleon, to a region of approximately 1.2 fm. The confinement 
</p>
<p>mechanism is not at all understood. One of the most successful phenomenological 
</p>
<p>models for quark confinement is the "MIT bag model," named after the institution 
</p>
<p>of the inventors of the model. In this model, it is simply assumed the quarks are 
</p>
<p>confined to a spherical region of space, with a radius, r = a, and VCr) = 0 for 
</p>
<p>r &lt; a. The rest mass of the u and d quarks, however, is so small their motion in the 
</p>
<p>region with r &lt; a must be treated by the Dirac equation. In a sense, the MIT bag 
</p>
<p>model is the quark analogue of the nuclear shell model. In one extreme version of 
</p>
<p>the nuclear shell model, the potential is assumed to have the form: VCr) = 0 for 
</p>
<p>r &lt; a, and V = +00 for r &gt; a. Our discussion of the Klein paradox, however, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>714 77. MIT Bag Model: Dirac Equation for Confined Quark 
</p>
<p>should convince us an infinite potential is unable to confine a relativistic particle. 
</p>
<p>It may be enough to solve a model in which the quark is in free particle motion 
</p>
<p>inside the region for r &lt; a, but is subject to boundary conditions at r = a that 
simply dictate the confinement. 
</p>
<p>We shall therefore find solutions to the Dirac equation with V (r) = 0 for r &lt; a; 
</p>
<p>i.e., 
</p>
<p>for r &lt; a, (1) 
</p>
<p>and boundary conditions (which insure the confinement) 
</p>
<p>at r = a (2) 
</p>
<p>and 
</p>
<p>1. at r = a. (3) 
</p>
<p>Relation 1. insures no net outward (radial) component of the probability density 
</p>
<p>current through the sphere of radius a exists. Relation 2. insures the same for the 
</p>
<p>Lorentz scalar quantity, {J 11/1 , over the surface of the sphere of radius a. 
In the region, r &lt; a, the solutions 1/1 are of the form 
</p>
<p>,I, = ( g(r)Y[lA!Jjm j ) f (. + I) 
't' / Y or K = =t= J "2' &plusmn; (r) [iB!)jm}

<p>where again j = (LA + ~); LB = (LA + 1), for the negative value of K (upper 
sign), and j = (LA - ~); LB = (LA - 1), for the positive value of K (lower 
</p>
<p>sign). Again, defining the one-dimensionalized radial functions, G(r) = rg(r), 
</p>

</p>
<p>A Occupation Number Representation 
</p>
<p>As already noted in Chapter 39, systems of many identical particles, either bosons 
</p>
<p>or fermions, form an important part of nature and, because of the required overall 
</p>
<p>symmetry or antisymmetry of the many-particle wave function, these form not only 
</p>
<p>important, but also very special, types of quantum-mechanical systems. Examples 
</p>
<p>we have met are the many-electron system of an atom, or the many-electron system 
</p>
<p>of condensed matter physics, the many nucleon-system of a nucleus, and the many-
</p>
<p>quark system of particle physics. All of these involve identical spin 4 particles and, 
hence, fermions. All of these identical particles have besides their orbital degrees 
</p>
<p>of freedom, internal degrees of freedom such as their spin degree of freedom, but 
</p>
<p>in the case of identical nucleons, an additional charge or isospin internal degree of 
</p>
<p>freedom, and in the case of quarks, additional flavor (including isospin) and color 
</p>
<p>degrees of freedom. Systems of identical bosons include the system of many 4He 
</p>
<p>atoms, an example of a many-particle system where we may be dealing with a 
</p>
<p>huge number of identical particles. Other examples of many-boson systems would 
</p>
<p>include more complicated atoms, provided the identical atoms have an electron 
</p>
<p>plus nucleon number that is an even number so the total atomic spin is an integer. 
</p>
<p>Such systems are of particular recent interest in connection with the Bose-Einstein 
</p>
<p>condensation of such atomic gases. 
</p>
<p>For the many-boson system, the total many-particle wave function must be 
</p>
<p>totally symmetric under any permutation of particle indices, where the permuta-
</p>
<p>tion operator must exchange the particle indices on all particle variables, orbital, 
</p>
<p>spin, and any additional internal variables, such as isospin or flavor and color </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>722 78. Many-Body Fonnalism 
</p>
<p>variables of the single-particle system. For the many-fermion system, the total 
</p>
<p>many-particle wave function must be totally anti symmetric; that is, it must change 
</p>
<p>sign under any odd permutation of particle indices, involving an odd number 
</p>
<p>of pair exchanges, whereas it must remain unchanged under any even permuta-
</p>
<p>tion, involving an even number of pair exchanges. For the two-particle system, it 
</p>
<p>was easy to construct two-particle wave functions with the appropriate symmetry 
</p>
<p>from products of single-particle wave functions. Moreover, it was easy to factor 
</p>
<p>the products of two-particle functions into products of their two-particle orbital 
</p>
<p>functions, two-particle spin functions, two-particle isospin functions, and possibly 
</p>
<p>two-particle functions of additional internal degrees offreedom, if applicable. The 
</p>
<p>construction of the two-particle total wave function of the appropriate symmetry 
</p>
<p>is then still very straightforward, because the products of two-particle symmetric 
</p>
<p>functions with two-particle antisymmetric (or symmetric) functions automatically 
</p>
<p>leads to two-particle antisymmetric (or symmetric) functions. For N :::: 3, how-
</p>
<p>ever, this factoring of the N-particle functions into orbital, spin, and possibly other 
</p>
<p>factors becomes more complicated, because of the existence of more complicated 
</p>
<p>intermediate symmetries. For N = 3, three types of three-particle symmetries 
</p>
<p>exist. Three-particle functions can be totally symmetric (completely unchanged 
</p>
<p>by any permutation operator), totally anti symmetric, with a change of sign under 
</p>
<p>any odd permutation and no change of sign under any even permutation, but the 
</p>
<p>possibility of more complicated intermediate symmetries exist. Such symmetries 
</p>
<p>are described by Young tableaux, pictures of N squares arranged in rows and 
</p>
<p>columns. A tableau with all N squares in the same row represents a totally sym-
</p>
<p>metric wave function. A tableau with all squares in the same column represents 
</p>
<p>a totally anti symmetric wave function. For N = 3, a possible intermediate sym-
</p>
<p>metry exists, involving a tableau with two squares in one row and a third square 
</p>
<p>placed in the first column, as shown in Fig. 78.1(a). Such a tableau represents a 
</p>
<p>three-particle function that can be made symmetric in one pair or antisymmetric 
</p>
<p>in one pair, but is patently such that it cannot be made more symmetric or more 
</p>
<p>antisymmetric. That is, an attempt to make such a function totally symmetric, by 
</p>
<p>acting on it with the full symmetrization operator, will destroy this wave function; 
</p>
<p>i.e., it will simply yield a result that is identically zero, similarly, for an attempt to 
</p>
<p>make such a function totally antisymmetric. Clearly, totally antisymmetric wave 
</p>
<p>functions could be constructed from products of totally symmetric spin functions 
</p>
<p>with totally antisymmetric orbital functions or totally antisymmetric spin functions 
</p>
<p>with totally symmetric orbital functions. As already mentioned in Chapter 39, for 
</p>
<p>electrons or any other s = 4 system, it is impossible to make three-particle spin 
functions totally antisymmetric, because the single-particle spin function has only 
</p>
<p>two possible quantum states; ms = &plusmn;4. Thus, three-particle s = 4 spin functions 
can only be totally symmetric, with S = ~ (see Chapter 39), or have intermediate 
symmetry, of type [21] (two squares in the first row of the tableau, one square in 
</p>
<p>the second row), with S = 4. These must be combined with orbital functions also 
of [21] symmetry to yield total wave functions which are totally antisymmetric. 
</p>
<p>The process of finding the proper linear combination of spin and orbital functions </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A Occupation Number Representation 723 
</p>
<p>with these symmetries, however, is already somewhat complicated for this sim-
</p>
<p>ple case with N = 3, two independent functions of intermediate [21] symmetry 
</p>
<p>exist, and the two independent spin functions must be combined with appropriate 
</p>
<p>"conjugate" orbital functions to make the required three-particle totally antisym-
</p>
<p>metric total wave function. For N = 4, the combinations of possible symmetries 
</p>
<p>is even richer. We can now have totally symmetric wave functions with all four 
</p>
<p>squares of the tableau in the same row, to be designated by [4] [see Fig. 78. 1 (b)]. 
</p>
<p>In addition, three independent functions of intermediate symmetry, [31], exist that 
</p>
<p>can be made symmetric in one group of three particles, but cannot be made more 
</p>
<p>symmetric and can be made anti symmetric in one pair of particles, but cannot be 
</p>
<p>made anti symmetric in more than one pair. The other four-particle symmetries 
</p>
<p>include two independent functions of symmetry [22] that can be made symmetric 
</p>
<p>in two different pairs, corresponding to the two rows of the tableau, or antisymmet-
</p>
<p>ric in two different pairs, corresponding to the two columns of the tableau; three 
</p>
<p>independent functions of symmetry [2 I I] that can be made anti symmetric in one 
</p>
<p>group of three but symmetric in at most one pair; and finally the totally antisym-
</p>
<p>metric function, [1111], corresponding to a tableau with a single column. Because 
</p>
<p>four-particle s = t spin functions cannot be anti symmetrized in groups of three, 
these can only have symmetries [4], with S = 2, [31] with S =: 1, and [22] with 
</p>
<p>S = O. To make the totally anti symmetric total wave function. these four types 
</p>
<p>of spin functions must be combined with the orbital functions of the appropriate 
</p>
<p>"conjugate" symmetry, involving Young tableaux in which the role of rows and 
</p>
<p>columns has been interchanged. Thus, totally symmetric spin functions of spin 
</p>
<p>symmetry, [4], must be combined with totally anti symmetric orbital functions of 
</p>
<p>symmetry, [1111]. Three independent spin functions of spin symmetry, [31], must 
</p>
<p>be combined in the proper linear combination with three orbital functions of the 
</p>
<p>appropriate conjugate functions of symmetry, [211], to make a totally antisymmet-
</p>
<p>ric total wave function. Similarly. two independent spin functions of intermediate 
</p>
<p>spin symmetry, [22], exist that must be combined in the proper linear combination 
</p>
<p>with the appropriately matched orbital functions, now also of symmetry, [22], to 
</p>
<p>make a totally antisymmetric total four-particle wave function. 
</p>
<p>For an N -electron atom, where it might be advantageous to factor the N -particle 
</p>
<p>wave function into a product of an N -particle spin function and an N -particle 
</p>
<p>orbital function, the process of antisymmetrization of the total wave function 
</p>
<p>becomes rather complicated for N ~ 3. It will therefore in general be better to anti-
</p>
<p>symmetrize the full N -particle wave function in terms of products of single-particle 
</p>
<p>wave functions involving all variables, orbital plus internal, of the type 
</p>
<p>with k = 1, ... , N. 
</p>
<p>where ~k stands for all variables of the particle labeled number, k; e.g., ~k = 
rk, rh, ik, " ., where rk gives the three orbital variables that give the position of 
particle, labeled k, in the quantum system, ch, stands for the internal spin degree of 
freedom of particle labeled k, i k stands for the internal isospin degree of freedom, 
</p>
<p>etc., where the ... may stand for additional internal degrees of freedom, such as 
</p>
<p>those of color, if applicable. In addition, an stands for all single-particle quan-</p>

<p>leading in this case to 
</p>
<p>( ... ni .. &middot;I(aia: - a: ai)I .. &middot; ni ... ) = +1. (12) 
</p>
<p>Because these relations must hold for all indices and all state vectors, the operators,

<p>(13)

<p>where the last two relations follow from the general matrix elements in simi-

<p>where the quantum number index, i, is shorthand for a specific set of values of all

<p>internal degrees of freedom, if applicable.

</p>
<p>Let us now construct the dynamical operators that we shall need and see how they 
</p>
<p>can be expressed in terms of single-particle creation and annihilation operators. The 
</p>
<p>simplest class of operators are the one-body operators. In coordinate representation, 
</p>
<p>they can be expressed through 
</p>
<p>N 
</p>
<p>Fop. = Lfi, with fi = fer;, V;, ai, i;, .. . ), (30) 
;=1 
</p>
<p>where . .. will stand for additional internal variables, with index i, if needed for 
</p>
<p>additional internal degrees of freedom. Examples would be the kinetic energy term

<p>in a nonrelativistic N -particle Hamiltonian 
</p>
<p>N ~2 
</p>
<p>T=I:~, 
i=1 2m; 
</p>
<p>(31) 
</p>
<p>or the potential terms of the N -particle system in an external field. e.g., the potential

<p>of the N -electron atomic system in the field of the central nucleus of charge, Ze,

<p>Other examples would be electric or magnetic multipole transition operators, e.g.,

<p>the three components of the electric dipole moment vector, 
</p>

<p>F = Le/;, (33)

<p>(34) 
</p>
<p>To transcribe such operators from their coordinate representation to the occupa-
</p>
<p>tion number representation, let us now use r; as shorthand for all variables, both 
orbital and intrinsic, with particle index i; i.e., r; == r;, (1;, i;, .... In this shorthand 
notation, f dr;, will then stand for an integral over all orbital variables and over all 
internal variables, or alternatively a matrix-element-taking over spin, isospin, ... , 
</p>
<p>quantum numbers, if the internal variables cannot be specified through specific 
</p>
<p>coordinates. A one-body operator can then be expressed through 
</p>
<p>Fop. = LL)a;a; .. &middot;a~}(a;a;&middot;&middot; &middot;a~IFla\a2&middot;&middot; &middot;aN}(a]a2&middot;&middot; 'aNI, (35) 
</p>
<p>where the sums over as and a; are infinite sums over all possible sets of N -particle 
</p>
<p>quantum numbers in their canonical ordering. We can convert this expression in 
</p>
<p>occupation number representation into coordinate representation, via 
</p>
<p>Fop. = fdr; .. . dr~f drl ... drNLa, La; la;a; ... a~}(a;a;&middot;&middot;&middot; a~lr; ... r~)

</p>
<p>(36) 
</p>
<p>Let us now specialize to the fermion case. (The boson case is very similar, except 
</p>
<p>for the additional phase factors that come into play for fermions.) In coordinate 
</p>
<p>representation, we have 
</p>
<p>N 
</p>
<p>(r; ... r~ILf(ri' V;, .. . W] ... rN) 
;=] 
</p>
<p>(37) 
</p>
<p>and the coordinate representations of the fully anti symmetrized N -particle states 
</p>
<p>can be expressed in the form of eq. (2) or eq. (3), 
</p>
<p>(a]&middot;&middot; 'aNlr]'" rN) = 'IIa, . .,aN(r], ... , rN). (38)

<p>Eq. (36) can therefore be transcribed into

<p>D Examples of One-Body Operators 
</p>
<p>Before proceeding to two-body operators, let us look at a few specific examples 
</p>
<p>of simple one-body operators in this new language. 
</p>
<p>1. The number operator. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>D Examples of One-Body Operators 733 
</p>
<p>One of the simplest one-body operators is the simple number operator that counts 
</p>
<p>the total number of particles. In the coordinate representation, it is simply a sum 
</p>
<p>of N unit operators 
</p>
<p>N 
</p>
<p>F='L)=N. 
i=1 
</p>
<p>With /;. = 1, the single-particle matrix elements are simply 
</p>
<p>(slflr) = (sillr) = osn 
</p>
<p>so 
</p>
<p>2. Total angular momentum operator. 
</p>
<p>In this case, we may want the three components, lz, lx, ly, where 
</p>
<p>N 
</p>
<p>lz = Ljz,i' 
i=1 
</p>
<p>(50) 
</p>
<p>(51) 
</p>
<p>(52) 
</p>
<p>(53) 
</p>
<p>where capital letters are used for the operator acting in the N -particle system and 
</p>
<p>the lowercase letter indicates the operator acts in the space of the single-particle 
</p>
<p>labeled with index i. If the total angular momentum vector is built from orbital 
</p>
<p>and spin angular momenta, j = i + S, it will be useful to employ an /nlsjmj} 
single-particle basis, with Ir} = InrIrsr jrm j), rather than a InImlsms} basis, so 
</p>
<p>lz = 10 is diagonal in this basis: 
</p>
<p>10 = L{iUo/k}a;ak 
i,k 
</p>
<p>= L(nilis;j;mj, UolnkhskikmA}a:ak

i,k 
</p>
<p>= LLmja:1SjmjanlSjmj' 
nlsj mj 
</p>
<p>(54) 
</p>
<p>The perpendicular components of j are best expressed in terms of h = (lx &plusmn; i ly), 
via 
</p>
<p>h = L{ilj&plusmn;lk}a;ak 
;,k 
</p>
<p>= LL.j(j -=f mj)(j &plusmn; mj + l)a:tSj(mj&plusmn;l)antSjmj' (55)

</p>
<p>where ri measures the position of the electron with particle index i relative to the

</p>
<p>(r )n'I'.nl = 100 drr2 R~'l,(r)r Rnl(r). 
</p>
<p>(57) 
</p>
<p>For a system of A nucleons in a nucleus, we can write the charge of the ith nucleon 
</p>
<p>as 
</p>
<p>ei = lel~(l - "["z.i), 
</p>
<p>and use a Inlm/smsmi) basis in a convention in which the neutron has isospin 
</p>
<p>quantum number mi = +~, with "["z-eigenvalue of + 1, whereas the proton has 
mi = -~, with "["z-eigenvalue of -1. In this A-particle system, we have 
</p>
<p>(el.) ~ 1 {4rr

</p>
<p>(58) 
</p>
<p>where the isospin quantum number, mi, has the values mi = +~ for neutrons, 
m; = - ~ for protons. (The subscript, i, on mi stands for isospin.) 
</p>
<p>4. Magnetic dipole moment operator. 
</p>
<p>For the magnetic dipole moment operator in the N -electron atom, we have 
</p>
<p>N eli [ ] (magn.) ~ -
iL+l = L -2 (li)+1 + g,(Si)+1 ' 
</p>
<p>i=1 me 
(59) </p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>E Two-Body Operators 735 
</p>
<p>with gs = 2, where we have neglected the nuclear magnetic moment because of 
</p>
<p>the small electron to nucleus mass ratio, m/ Mnucl.. In the new language, we would 
then have 
</p>
<p>(60) 
</p>
<p>E Two-Body Operators 
</p>
<p>In coordinate representation, two-body operators can be written as a sum over 
</p>
<p>~N(N - 1) terms 
</p>
<p>where 
</p>
<p>N 
</p>
<p>Gop. = Lgik. 
;&lt;k 
</p>
<p>(61) 
</p>
<p>gik = geT;, rk) = g(rk. r;), (62) 
</p>
<p>and we again use the shorthand notation: Let ri stand for all coordinates, both 
</p>
<p>orbital and internal, for particle labeled with particle index, i. A simple example 
</p>
<p>would be the Coulomb repulsion potential between electrons in an N -electron 
</p>
<p>atom, 
</p>
<p>e2 e2 
gik = - = ~ ~. 
</p>
<p>rik Iri - rkl 
(63) 
</p>
<p>Now, using the antisymmetry of the N-particle wave functions, 'lI&lt;&gt;'1&lt;&gt;'2 &bull;&bull;&bull; &lt;&gt;'N' we can 
</p>
<p>reduce the matrix element of Gop. to a matrix element of g12. 
</p>
<p>(64) 
</p>
<p>where this is the analogue of eq. (41) for the one-body operator, F~p .. In addition, it 
</p>
<p>will be useful to expand the totally anti symmetric N -particle functions, \{1ala2" .. aN'

<p>Applications 
</p>
<p>A Construction of All Pauli-Allowed States of a 
(d5/2)N=3 Fermion Configuration 
</p>
<p>As a first simple application, let us construct all allowed states of a (d5/ 2 )N=3 
</p>
<p>configuration of identical fermions. The fermions could be electrons in a valence 
</p>
<p>shell of an atom for which the j - j coupling scheme is valid, or they could 
</p>
<p>be identical nucleons, either all protons or all neutrons, in a nuclear shell model 
</p>
<p>valence orbit of a nucleus. Let us first consider the possible states for a system of 
</p>
<p>three distinguishable particles, each with a single-particle angular momentum with 
</p>
<p>j = 5/2. They could be distinguishable because they are different particles, e.g., 
one proton, one neutron, and one electron, or they could be identical particles, say, 
</p>
<p>all neutrons in a nucleus, but with different principal and orbital angular momentum 
</p>
<p>quantum numbers; i.e. nlll i= n2h i= n313. For this case of three distinguishable 
particles, each with j = 5/2, there are 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 allowed states with total 
angular momenta, I, given by 
</p>
<p>(1)2 (3)4 (5)6 (7)5 (9)4 (11)3 (13)2 (15)1 I= '2 ' '2 ' 2" ' '2 ' 2" ' "2 ' "2 ' "2 ' 
</p>
<p>where the superscripts give the number of occurences of each listed I value. The 
</p>
<p>two independent I = i states could be obtained from the two states with Il2 = 2 
and Il2 = 3 coupled with the third j = 5/2-particle. In general, we have 
</p>
<p>I = [l12 X ~] = [(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) x ~]. </p>
<p/>

<p>740 79. Many-Body Techniques: Some Simple Applications 
</p>
<p>For three identical j = ~ fermions, however, the set of allowed total J values is 
</p>
<p>much more restricted. Because the three fermions are assumed to have the same 
</p>
<p>values for the quantum numbers, nlsj, with s = ! and j = ~, let us use the 
abbreviation 
</p>
<p>i.e., for economy of writing the common quantum numbers, nlsj, will be quietly 
</p>

</p>
<p>where the "vacuum" state, 10), could be the true vacuum state, with particle number

</p>
<p>which satisfy the condition, am.IO) = 0, where am. is the shorthand notation for 
</p>
<p>the annihilation operator for the nlsjm single-particle state under consideration. 
</p>
<p>Because the above 
</p>
<p>will be identically equal to zero, if m 1 = m2, or if any two mk are the same, there 
</p>
<p>will be six possible choices for mb but once ml has been chosen, there are only 
</p>
<p>five possible choices for m2, and once both m 1 and m2 have been chosen, only four 
</p>
<p>possible choices for m3 remain. In addition, any of the possible 3! permutations of 
</p>
<p>the quantum numbers mk can at most change the sign of the above three-fermion 
</p>
<p>state. Therefore, only 
</p>
<p>6&middot;5&middot;4 
--=20 
</p>
<p>3! 
</p>
<p>independent states exist in a configuration of three identical j = 5/2 fermions, 
in place of the 216 states with J values ranging from ! to &yen; listed above. What 
are the possible J, MJ values of these 20 states? It will be worthwhile to answer 
</p>
<p>this question through a specific construction of these states. This process will then 
</p>
<p>permit us to make calculations involving such states. The requirement m I =I m2 =I 
m3 shows us the highest possible value of MJ = m1 + m2 + m3 is

<p>C Pairing Forces in Nuclei 
</p>
<p>Two-particle states coupled to angular momentum, J = 0, are of particular 
</p>
<p>relevance in nuclear physics, especially in configurations of identical nucleons, 
</p>
<p>because the nucleon-nucleon interaction is a short -range attractive interaction. 
</p>
<p>Because identical nucleons with the same nand l in states lim) and Ij - m} have 
</p>
<p>the same spatial distribution, two identical nucleons coupled to two-particle J = 0 
</p>
<p>have a large probability of being within the range of the attractive nucleon-nucleon 
</p>
<p>interaction. Low-lying states of nuclei thus have a larger probability of containing 
</p>
<p>J = 0 pairs compared with pairs coupled to J &gt; O. In particular, the ground states 
</p>
<p>of all known stable even-even nuclei (with even neutron and proton numbers) are 
</p>
<p>observed to have spin and parity 0+. States of two identical nucleons, either both 
</p>
<p>neutrons or both protons in a shell model state with the same nl, coupled to J = 0, 
</p>
<p>are given by eq. (14). It will therefore be useful to define nucleon pair creation 
</p>
<p>operators 
</p>
<p>(27) 
</p>
<p>where we have omitted the common quantum numbers nl in the single nucleon 
</p>
<p>creation operators (for the sake of brevity of notation) and we have left off the two-
</p>
<p>particle normalization factor, [(j + ~)] - ~ , to simplify the anticommutator algebra </p>
<p/>

<p>of such operators. We also define the pair annihilation operators

</p>
<p>(j + t - p)! (AT)PIO). 
(j + !)!p! j 
</p>
<p>(29) 
</p>
<p>The overall normalization factor can be understood as follows: For one pair coupled 
</p>
<p>to J = 0, (j + ~) terms of the type (-l)j-ma;ma ;-m exist. For p = 2, once one 
of these terms is fixed at some specific m = m I &gt; 0, the second pair operator can 
</p>
<p>multiply this term with only (j - t) terms with m2 =1= m I, but the two terms with 
m 1 and m2 interchanged are identical, because the anticommutation relations of 
</p>
<p>the fermion operators yield 
</p>
<p>so that there are ! (j + ~)(j - ~) independent terms but each appears with a factor 
of 2 for the case of two pairs, p = 2. For higher p, by the same arguments, there 
will be (j + t)(j - t) ... (j + ~ - p) / p! independent terms, but each will appear 
with a factor of p!, requiring a normalization factor of 
</p>
<p>p!(j + ~ - p)! 
p! (j + ~)! 
</p>
<p>In rough approximation, the nucleon-nucleon interaction could be replaced 
</p>
<p>by an attractive pairing interaction that acts only when nucleons are coupled in 
</p>
<p>pairs to J = O. Although a realistic interaction will have finite terms involving 
</p>
<p>nucleon pairs coupled to J =1= 0, the highly simplified pairing interaction will give 
</p>
<p>a qualitative account of the nuclear spectra involving the lowest energy states. A 
</p>
<p>general pairing interaction would be given by a Hamiltonian of the form

<p>With p = 4n, where n is the number of nucleons in the p-pair state with J = 0,

<p>Because the energy of this state is independent of M J, we can choose M J i= 0 so
