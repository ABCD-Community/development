<p>Preface
</p>
<p>Access to energy resources, energy supply security, high and increasing prices of
</p>
<p>energy, lack of competition, slow market entry of renewables, insufficient invest-
</p>
<p>ment in energy efficiency, and sluggish progress in reducing greenhouse gas
</p>
<p>emissions are all well-known issues and concerns characterizing energy markets.
</p>
<p>Yet, what are the possibilities of finding effective, efficient, and sustainable
</p>
<p>solutions to these problems? The fundamental claim of this book is that solutions
</p>
<p>cannot be found without an in-depth analysis of energy markets that acknowledges
</p>
<p>not only their physical and technological constraints but also their structural
</p>
<p>idiosyncrasies and the behavior of market participants.
</p>
<p>This text is the result of 30 years of teaching and research performed by the
</p>
<p>authors at both German- and English-speaking universities in Europe. It therefore
</p>
<p>adopts a distinctly European approach, yet without neglecting developments world-
</p>
<p>wide. While firmly anchored in economic theory, it also presents empirical evi-
</p>
<p>dence enabling readers to assess the relevance of predicted relationships. For
</p>
<p>instance, it is certainly of interest to know that the so-called elasticity of substitution
</p>
<p>is a crucial parameter for answering the question whether man-made capital can
</p>
<p>replace energy quickly enough to assure sustainability in terms of consumption in
</p>
<p>spite of the fact that energy constitutes an ultimately limited resource. In addition, it
</p>
<p>is also important to see whether the estimated elasticities of substitution are
</p>
<p>typically below one (making sustainability questionable) or above one (suggesting
</p>
<p>sustainability can be attained).
</p>
<p>Debates about energy policy tend to be short-lived, reflecting the interests of
</p>
<p>governments who wish to demonstrate to their electorate that they are &ldquo;on top of
</p>
<p>things.&rdquo; By way of contrast, this text focuses on the basic conditions and
</p>
<p>mechanisms that all public interventions in the energy sector have to deal with. It
</p>
<p>provides readers with the tools enabling them to assess the chance of these
</p>
<p>interventions reaching their objectives. Turning to the private sector, one condition
</p>
<p>is that management decisions concerning energy are economically viable, lest they
</p>
<p>fail to contribute to the economic survival of the company. This book is therefore
</p>
<p>also of interest to business practitioners who may be confronted with the question
</p>
<p>whether investment in an energy-saving technology has a sufficiently high return to
</p>
<p>be worthwhile. Analysts of the energy industry, energy traders, and other
</p>
<p>professionals acting in and on behalf of the energy sector will benefit from this
</p>
<p>v</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>text as well. Like the makers of public policy, they are confronted with shocks of all
</p>
<p>sorts impinging on energy markets with unprecedented frequency, exposing them to
</p>
<p>increasing business risks.
</p>
<p>Finally, this work also targets future researchers with an interest in energy. The
</p>
<p>distinct properties of energy sources (ranging from coal to solar) need to be taken
</p>
<p>into account when modeling the behavior of businesses and consumers. The
</p>
<p>corresponding markets are distinct to a sufficient degree to warrant a partial (rather
</p>
<p>than general-equilibrium) approach for their analysis, at least as a first approxima-
</p>
<p>tion. The statistical documentation of energy is excellent both at the national and
</p>
<p>international level, paving the way for empirical research. Moreover, an important
</p>
<p>motivation may be that research revolving around the economics of energy is met
</p>
<p>with considerable interest by society and public policy.
</p>
<p>Students at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ETH Zurich (Switzerland),
</p>
<p>the University of the Armed Forces in Munich (Germany), the Technical University
</p>
<p>of Berlin (Germany), the RWTH Aachen University (Germany), and the Diplo-
</p>
<p>matic Academy of Vienna (Austria), as well as participants in international
</p>
<p>conferences, have all contributed to this volume through their suggestions and
</p>
<p>criticisms. Its original German version has been well received by both Engineering
</p>
<p>and Economics students (future leaders and decision-makers in energy markets),
</p>
<p>thus motivating our attempt to make this work accessible to English-speaking
</p>
<p>readers.
</p>
<p>This text is somewhat voluminous because in addition to expounding the
</p>
<p>theoretical groundwork, it also addresses each of the several energy sources.
</p>
<p>However, individual chapters are self-contained, with cross-references to other
</p>
<p>topics. This broad approach has the advantage of providing a reference especially
</p>
<p>for business practitioners who need to obtain insight into a particular market. At the
</p>
<p>same time, readers never lose sight of the consequences of public regulation and
</p>
<p>liberalization, which frequently cut across sectors (not least caused by substitution
</p>
<p>processes that depend on the elasticity of substitution alluded to above). At a time
</p>
<p>when energy markets change and develop at an unprecedented pace, this guidance
</p>
<p>through the maze is particularly valuable, and when new market developments
</p>
<p>challenge received wisdom, new economic insights develop. We will therefore
</p>
<p>provide on our website www.energy-economics.eu additional material reflecting
</p>
<p>new data sources and the scientific progress in the field.
</p>
<p>This joint effort would not have been possible without the support of many
</p>
<p>colleagues and collaborators, which is sincerely acknowledged. Of course, the
</p>
<p>authors remain responsible for all remaining errors.

<p>Introduction 1
</p>
<p>This chapter seeks to answer a few questions of general interest:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Why has energy economics developed as a separate discipline of economics?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Why does energy economics cover more than the straightforward application of
</p>
<p>standard economic methods and models to energy markets?
</p>
<p>What are the reasons for politicians to have a particular propensity to intervene
</p>
<p>in energy markets?
</p>
<p>The variables used in this chapter are:
</p>
<p>C Annual production cost
</p>
<p>Π Annual profit
</p>
<p>p Price per output unit
</p>
<p>Q Annual output (quantity)
</p>
<p>1.1 Philosophical and Evolutionary Aspects of Energy
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Energy is life&rdquo;. Energy in the form of light is seen as the origin of the genesis
</p>
<p>(Genesis 1: 2&ndash;3). According to Greek mythology, history of human life starts with
</p>
<p>the stealing of fire by Prometheus&mdash;an act for which he was condemned to
</p>
<p>eternal pain.
</p>
<p>These citations may be sufficient to highlight the philosophical dimension of
</p>
<p>energy. According to the second theorem of thermodynamics (also known as the
</p>
<p>law of increasing entropy), all forms of life, i.e. the existence of complex structures,
</p>
<p>depend on the availability and utilization of employable energy.1 The American
</p>
<p>economist and philosopher Georgescu-Roegen formulated this as follows, &ldquo;Given
</p>
<p>1Employable energy that is capable of performing work is also called exergy.

<p>that even a simple cell is a highly ordered structure, how is it possible for such a
</p>
<p>structure to avoid being thrown into disorder instantly by the inexorable Entropy
</p>
<p>Law? The answer of modern science has a definite economic flavor: a living
</p>
<p>organism is a steady going concern which maintains its highly ordered structure
</p>
<p>by sucking low entropy from the environment so as to compensate for the entropic
</p>
<p>degradation to which it is continuously subject&rdquo; (Georgescu-Roegen 1971, p. 191f).
</p>
<p>Thus, each living organism needs to acquire useful energy, which is associated with
</p>
<p>effort or cost. In spite of the abundant global availability of energy, in particular
</p>
<p>solar radiation, useful energy is always a scarce good.
</p>
<p>A characteristic feature of biological evolution is the diversity of ways used by
</p>
<p>species to absorb energy. Individual species use a variety of food as energy source,
</p>
<p>and different methods of approaching these energy sources; moreover, they assimi-
</p>
<p>late the energy contained in their food in manifold ways. The methods of acquiring,
</p>
<p>storing, and using energy belong to their distinguishing characteristics, which also
</p>
<p>determine their rank within the evolutionary hierarchy.
</p>
<p>Securing a continuous energy supply&mdash;condition for the sustainable existence of
</p>
<p>species&mdash;requires the ability to shift to other energy sources (e.g. food) in case
</p>
<p>those used thus far are exhausted. In turn, such adaptations affect the existence and
</p>
<p>living conditions of other species. Therefore, biological evolution can be under-
</p>
<p>stood as a mutual development of energy systems used by species, which determine
</p>
<p>their population growth and living conditions. This co-evolution can occur fast or
</p>
<p>slowly; however, it is never stationary as long as life continues.
</p>
<p>The suggested energy-related interpretation of evolutionary patterns in biology
</p>
<p>is also relevant for the evolution of social systems. In fact, historical development is
</p>
<p>characterized by phases of stability and phases of disruptive innovations:
</p>
<p>&ndash; One of the conditions for the development of human civilization was the control
</p>
<p>of fire. Before, energy in form of biomass was used for the biological metabo-
</p>
<p>lism of human bodies. Now, the thermal use of biomass became possible. The
</p>
<p>thermal use of biomass by hominids may have begun around 800,000 years ago.
</p>
<p>The control of fire became a key distinction between the Homo erectus, the
</p>
<p>ancestor of the Homo sapiens, and other species. It was also causal for the first
</p>
<p>forms of cultural life with the family as its roots.
</p>
<p>&ndash; A further milestone of human civilization was triggered by the Neolithic revo-
</p>
<p>lution with the emergence of agriculture and farming 10,000&ndash;20,000 years ago.
</p>
<p>It required technological know-how concerning the use of energy along with the
</p>
<p>division of labor for creating the first urban infrastructures. This important
</p>
<p>societal change also marks the beginning of scientific research.
</p>
<p>&ndash; About 5000&ndash;6000 years ago, the use of other renewable energy sources (sailing
</p>
<p>boats, later on wind mills and water mills) created the conditions of advanced
</p>
<p>civilizations.
</p>
<p>&ndash; With the first industrial revolution, muscular power of animals and humans
</p>
<p>(often slaves) was replaced by engines, with coal becoming the fuel of mechani-
</p>
<p>zation. Industrial development was concentrated in areas with easy access to
</p>
<p>coal: instead of transporting coal to the people, people were moved from rural
</p>
<p>2 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>areas to industrial centers. The implications were significant socially, giving rise
</p>
<p>to so-called Manchester capitalism, trade unionism, as well as concerns for the
</p>
<p>environment. A piece of evidence is the artificial word &lsquo;smog&rsquo;, which combines
</p>
<p>&lsquo;smoke&rsquo; from the burning of coal and &lsquo;fog&rsquo;. Indeed, disastrous air pollution led
</p>
<p>to several thousands of premature deaths in London and other industrial centers.
</p>
<p>&ndash; At the turn of the twentieth century, coal was partly replaced by crude oil as the
</p>
<p>leading energy source, foremost in the United States. The ample availability of
</p>
<p>this relatively cheap energy source made the realization of the American Dream
</p>
<p>(meaning material prosperity for all) possible&mdash;though associated with excess
</p>
<p>use and waste of energy.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The service, information, and communication society (the outcome of the
</p>
<p>second industrial revolution) depends on electricity as its key energy source.
</p>
<p>Development of the necessary power systems started with large-scale thermal
</p>
<p>power plants, including nuclear. Currently, these capacities are being replaced
</p>
<p>by distributed power generation based on wind, solar, biomass, and cogeneration
</p>
<p>(also known as combined heat and power). This transition has just begun; at this
</p>
<p>time, a future steady state is not yet in sight. However, it is quite possible that the
</p>
<p>character of society may change again, due to a massive acceleration of
</p>
<p>innovation transforming its infrastructure.
</p>
<p>This short overview indicates that stages in the development of energy systems
</p>
<p>have paralleled the evolution of societies. Therefore a comprehensive analysis of
</p>
<p>energy systems has to cover much more than its engineering and economic aspects.
</p>
<p>Contemporary critical writers decry the unsustainable development of present
</p>
<p>energy systems. Some claim that a transition to a sustainable, environmentally
</p>
<p>friendly energy system needs to go along with basic societal change modifying the
</p>
<p>way of life in modern industrial societies&mdash;not to mention that in developing
</p>
<p>countries. Others reject the economic approach to solving energy problems,
</p>
<p>maintaining that a transformation designed to achieve sustainability should not be
</p>
<p>driven by economics but rather by social and ethical ideas.
</p>
<p>While most energy economists accept the importance of ethical responsibility
</p>
<p>and social justice within and between generations, they also point to historical
</p>
<p>experience suggesting that societal guidelines and governance can have rather
</p>
<p>disastrous results if individual preferences and welfare are neglected. Transforming
</p>
<p>an energy system is not feasible if political decisions and interventions lack the
</p>
<p>majoritarian support of the society. Consideration of people&rsquo;s preferences and
</p>
<p>constraints with regard to energy is key to energy economics. The remit of energy
</p>
<p>economics is to seek solutions that take into account the preferences of consumers,
</p>
<p>managers, and owners of companies as well as political leaders. Of course,
</p>
<p>individuals who are altruistic and take the welfare of others into account facilitate
</p>
<p>such solutions, yet a society consisting mostly of altruistic individuals is likely to be
</p>
<p>an idealistic assumption.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Why Energy Economics?
</p>
<p>General economic theory provides a number of relevant insights for analyzing
</p>
<p>energy markets. Notably, energy sources belong to the category of scarce goods
</p>
<p>even if they are physically abundant. Like in other markets, prices coordinate
</p>
<p>individual decisions on the supply and the demand side. At first sight, the model
</p>
<p>of an ideal market seems to apply to many energy markets: They can be clearly
</p>
<p>defined, products traded on them are highly homogeneous at least from a physical
</p>
<p>point of view, and many prices are transparent. If the number of independent
</p>
<p>suppliers is large, the corresponding energy market fits the model of perfect
</p>
<p>atomistic competition. This means that individual suppliers can only choose the
</p>
<p>quantity of energy Q they would like to offer (acting as so-called price takers). Let
</p>
<p>them maximize their per-period profit, i.e. the difference between revenue �p�Q and
total cost C(Q),
</p>
<p>Π Q&eth; &THORN; &frac14; �p � Q� C Q&eth; &THORN;: &eth;1:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>The solution to this problem can be found by setting the derivative of the profit
</p>
<p>function (1.1) with respect to the produced quantity Q equal to zero,
</p>
<p>dΠ
</p>
<p>dQ
&frac14;
</p>
<p>d p � Q&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>dQ
�
</p>
<p>dC
</p>
<p>dQ
&frac14; �p�
</p>
<p>dC
</p>
<p>dQ
&frac14; 0 ! C0 :&frac14;
</p>
<p>dC
</p>
<p>dQ
&frac14; �p: &eth;1:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>Under atomistic competition, producers cannot individually influence the sales
</p>
<p>price p, causing them to take it as a predetermined constant p &frac14; �p. Thus, as long as
the sales price exceeds the extra cost of producing an additional unit C0 (known as
</p>
<p>marginal cost), producers have an incentive to expand output. Otherwise, they will
</p>
<p>curtail production.
</p>
<p>If each supplier decides according to the marginal cost rule, the resulting market
</p>
<p>price equals the marginal cost of the last unit needed to meet overall demand. The
</p>
<p>corresponding supplier is called marginal supplier, while those with marginal cost
</p>
<p>below the market price earn a producer surplus that allows them to recover at least
</p>
<p>part of their fixed cost of production.
</p>
<p>On the demand side, marginal willingness to pay derives from marginal utility of
</p>
<p>consumption. Demand for a good is triggered as long as its marginal utility exceeds
</p>
<p>the marginal cost of consumption (the market price in this simple model). In the
</p>
<p>case of energy, this is a derived demand because utility does not emanate directly
</p>
<p>from the consumption of energy but rather from the services associated with it, such
</p>
<p>as lighting, heating, use of appliances, and transportation. Therefore, the contribu-
</p>
<p>tion of energy to the production of these services (its marginal productivity to be
</p>
<p>precise) has to be taken into account to determine the marginal utility of energy.
</p>
<p>This description is highly simplified. In actual fact, consumers are interested in
</p>
<p>more than just one good. The rule, &ldquo;Marginal utility equal price&rdquo; therefore has to be
</p>
<p>generalized to become, &ldquo;The ratio of any two marginal utilities equals the ratio of
</p>
<p>their prices&rdquo;. Accordingly, the &lsquo;utility of energy&rsquo; amounts to the marginal utility
</p>

<p>associated with the next-best alternative which the consumer foregoes when pur-
</p>
<p>chasing energy (so-called opportunity cost).
</p>
<p>1.2.1 Price Mechanism and Market Coordination
</p>
<p>In a market economy, the function of prices is the decentralized coordination of
</p>
<p>supply and demand. No market participant needs to have knowledge of the situation
</p>
<p>of other market participants (regarding their individual cost and opportunity cost in
</p>
<p>particular). Knowledge of the market price is sufficient for coordination through
</p>
<p>markets. For market prices to play their intended role, they need to have an impact
</p>
<p>on demand and supply quantities. This is generally the case. On the supply side, a
</p>
<p>higher sales price causes aggregate supply to increase (see the positive slope of the
</p>
<p>supply function in Fig. 1.1). In the short term, this means that producers are running
</p>
<p>down stocks and increasing capacity utilization, while in the long term, this entails
</p>
<p>an increase in production capacity by incumbents and market entry by newcomers.
</p>
<p>On the demand side, a higher price leads to reduced consumption (see the negative
</p>
<p>slope of the demand function in Fig. 1.1). An increase in price of the good in
</p>
<p>question drives up opportunity cost since its purchase leaves less income to be spent
</p>
<p>on other goods and services. Short-term reactions in the case of energy include
</p>
<p>setting thermostat values at a lower level and traveling shorter distances, while
</p>
<p>intermediate and long-term reactions can be purchasing energy-efficient
</p>
<p>appliances, insulating buildings, and substituting expensive fuels (e.g. gasoline)
</p>
<p>with less expensive fuels (e.g. diesel).
</p>
<p>In Fig. 1.1, the price of energy (relative to that of other goods and services) is
</p>
<p>depicted on the vertical axis, although it is the argument of both the demand and the
</p>

<p>equilibrium, indicated by point A0. For reaching this equilibrium, the only informa-
</p>
<p>tion that must be available to all agents is the market price. It permits each market
</p>
<p>participant to individually decide how much to demand and how much to supply,
</p>
<p>without taking into account the behavior of other market participants.
</p>
<p>The coordinating function of a market also becomes evident when an exogenous
</p>
<p>change in market conditions occurs. For example, let an increase in income boost
</p>
<p>willingness to pay of consumers. This implies that they are prepared to pay a higher
</p>
<p>price of a given quantity of energy (depicted as the vertical shift of the demand
</p>
<p>curve to become the dashed line of Fig. 1.1). Alternatively, consumers can be said
</p>
<p>to demand a higher quantity at a given price, which amounts to an outward shift of
</p>
<p>the demand curve. Under either interpretation, the shift of the demand curve leads
</p>
<p>to a shift of the market equilibrium from A0 to A1, with a new, higher equilibrium
</p>
<p>price pE
**
</p>
<p>&gt; pE
* and a new, higher quantity transacted Q** &gt; Q*.
</p>
<p>However, supply may not be as flexible in the very short term as depicted. In the
</p>
<p>extreme, it does not respond to the higher sales price at first, implying that the
</p>
<p>supply curve runs vertical at point A0. Accordingly, price will shoot up to the level
</p>
<p>pmax. The increased price signals to suppliers that it is profitable to expand produc-
</p>
<p>tion at the prevailing market price, causing prices to fall from pmax to pE
** while the
</p>
<p>quantity transacted rises to Q**.
</p>
<p>Given perfect competition (no market power, no discrimination against any
</p>
<p>consumer or producer, no external effects, and transparency with respect to
</p>
<p>price), the equilibrium is Pareto-efficient. This means that no supplier and no
</p>
<p>consumer can reach a better position unless at least one market participant is
</p>
<p>made worse off. To see this, consider a price slightly higher than the initial
</p>
<p>equilibrium price pE
*, with the solid demand curve obtaining. Of course, this
</p>
<p>would improve the situation of suppliers. However, consumers would suffer.
</p>
<p>Moreover, at pE
* the minimum value of marginal willingness to pay of those served
</p>
<p>still suffices to cover the marginal cost of the extra unit of energy made available to
</p>
<p>them. This means there is no squandering of resources. Therefore, in a Pareto-
</p>
<p>optimal state the market allocation is efficient.
</p>
<p>It would be desirable if this simple law of supply and demand offered conclusive
</p>
<p>answers to the strategic issues relating to energy, such as:
</p>
<p>&ndash; How much scarce capital should be invested in the exploration, development,
</p>
<p>and distribution of new energy sources?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What quantities of scarce production factors should be allocated to the extraction
</p>
<p>of already known energy deposits of inferior quality?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What quantities of scarce factors of production should be made available for
</p>
<p>substituting fossil energy with renewable energies or the implementation of
</p>
<p>energy efficiency measures, respectively?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How much should be invested in the abatement or management of environmen-
</p>
<p>tal emissions?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How much should be devoted to improving the safety of energy systems?

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In many instances, the simple model of a competitive market may provide first
</p>
<p>hints towards answering these and similar questions. Yet deeper analysis shows that
</p>
<p>this model is not always appropriate for explaining and analyzing the complex
</p>
<p>reality of energy markets. Indeed, a simplistic model may in the extreme even result
</p>
<p>in misleading statements about a particular market characterized by crucial
</p>
<p>particularities.
</p>
<p>1.2.2 Particularities of Energy Markets
</p>
<p>If the idealized model of atomistic competition were a perfect representation of
</p>
<p>energy markets, there would be no reason for energy economics as a specific field of
</p>
<p>economics to exist. The role of energy economists would simply be the collection
</p>
<p>and evaluation of energy market data using standard economic concepts. However,
</p>
<p>energy economics is more than just the mere collection and statistical analysis of
</p>
<p>market data. Most markets for energy have particularities due to physical, geologi-
</p>
<p>cal, geographical, and technical properties of the energy source traded, making
</p>
<p>them deviate from the idealized economic model. The following list contains some
</p>
<p>of these characteristics:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Without energy, no economic activity is possible. In economic language, energy
</p>
<p>is an essential factor of production, very much like labor (whereas a subsistence
</p>
<p>economy can do without physical and human capital). Disruptions of energy
</p>
<p>supply (e.g. the oil crisis of 1973/1974, electricity blackouts) can cause severe
</p>
<p>damages to the economy and society.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Energy is necessary to satisfy basic human needs. Economic progress in many
</p>
<p>poor societies is hampered by an insufficient supply of energy, which in turn is
</p>
<p>often caused by a lack of ability to pay. Therefore, low incomes lead to
</p>
<p>unavailability of energy which in turn depresses productivity and hence
</p>
<p>incomes&mdash;the classical example of a poverty trap.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Most energy infrastructure is characterized by long periods of planning, invest-
</p>
<p>ment, and operation. As a consequence, its adjustment to economic and social
</p>
<p>change is slow. Since trends in energy demand cannot be easily predicted,
</p>
<p>relatively long spells of excess capacity and lack of capacity may occur.
</p>
<p>&ndash; In many countries property rights of underground resources and hydropower are
</p>
<p>vested with the public rather than the private sector. Likewise, the construction
</p>
<p>of infrastructure (e.g. pipelines or transmission lines) often requires the right to
</p>
<p>use public grounds such as streets. Depending on the authority in charge (local,
</p>
<p>regional, or national government), energy markets are generally more dependent
</p>
<p>on political decisions (and with them public pressure) compared to other
</p>
<p>markets.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Reserves of fossil energy reserves such as crude oil and natural gas are
</p>
<p>concentrated in a few countries, whose economy is dominated by the extraction
</p>
<p>industry. This facilitates a symbiosis between (often multinational) companies
</p>
<p>and domestic politicians which may be beset by corruption. In addition,
</p>
<p>1.2 Why Energy Economics? 7</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>resource-abundant countries face a major challenge when their extraction indus-
</p>
<p>try starts to decline due to the depletion of resource deposits.
</p>
<p>&ndash; A well-known and widely discussed issue is negative environmental impacts of
</p>
<p>the extraction, transformation, transmission, and use of energy. Indeed, the
</p>
<p>energy sector is the largest single source of emissions into air, water, and soil.
</p>
<p>In economic terms, these emissions represent negative externalities which are
</p>
<p>normally not reflected in the prices of energy sources, causing markets not to be
</p>
<p>Pareto-efficient.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Another challenge of technical energy systems is the risk of large-scale
</p>
<p>accidents. This risk is not only relevant for nuclear power generation but also
</p>
<p>wherever large quantities of energy are locally concentrated, e.g. in a boiler or an
</p>
<p>oil tanker. Beginning in the nineteenth century, inspection authorities have been
</p>
<p>created whose mission is to protect people working in plants and living in
</p>
<p>surrounding areas. Yet, they suffer from an asymmetry of information in that
</p>
<p>plant managers know more about the level of safety achieved than the regulator
</p>
<p>(this is a core issue in the economic theory of regulation).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Negative environmental externalities can be reduced by saving energy and
</p>
<p>improving energy efficiency, but demand for and supply of investment in energy
</p>
<p>efficiency is not developing as fast as intended due to a number of distortions. As
</p>
<p>a result, political interventions designed to speed up the process may be initiated.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Physical depletion of fossil energy sources and the risk of climate change due to
</p>
<p>large scale emissions of greenhouse gases give rise to the issue of intergenera-
</p>
<p>tional justice. This type of justice requires that current decisions concerning
</p>
<p>energy systems should reflect the interests of both present and future generations
</p>
<p>in an efficient way.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Many renewable energy technologies presently are not fully competitive but
</p>
<p>may become competitive in the future, when prices of exhaustible resources are
</p>
<p>bid up. Consumers may have an interest in their market entry being sped up,
</p>
<p>possibly justifying their subsidization by government in the aim of ensuring a
</p>
<p>sufficient future supply of energy. Since these new technologies may fail to
</p>
<p>become competitive, economic analysis designed to determine the conditions
</p>
<p>under which subsidies of this type are efficiency-enhancing and serving inter-
</p>
<p>generational justice is called for.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Many energy markets are characterized by monopolies or oligopolies rather than
</p>
<p>perfect competition. In the transmission and distribution grid industries (natural
</p>
<p>gas, electricity, and district heat), the monopoly can even be said to be &lsquo;natural&rsquo;
</p>
<p>since the establishment of competing infrastructures would be wasteful. The
</p>
<p>downside is a potential abuse of power by the single provider. In order to prevent
</p>
<p>this, governments generally regulate these industries.
</p>
<p>In view of this long list, it is evident that many energy markets function and are
</p>
<p>governed by rules in ways that do not correspond to the model of a perfect market.
</p>
<p>They therefore need to be analyzed using more complex modeling approaches.
</p>
<p>While economists have developed a manifold of them, the analysis of monopolistic
</p>
<p>markets provides first guidance in many instances. The basic idea is that a
</p>
<p>8 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>monopolistic supplier does not consider its sales price p as an exogenously given
</p>
<p>market price but rather influences it by its own actions. Indeed, being a monopolist
</p>
<p>means being confronted with the aggregate demand function and its negative slope.
</p>
<p>This implies that quantity sold Q (and hence production) and sales price p are
</p>
<p>negatively related. Therefore dp/dQ &lt; 0, contrary to the case of atomistic competi-
</p>
<p>tion where dp/dQ &frac14; 0 (see Eq. 1.2). Using the quantity produced as the decision
variable, one obtains the first order condition for profit maximization,
</p>
<p>dΠ
</p>
<p>dQ
&frac14;
</p>
<p>d p Q&eth; &THORN; � Q&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>dQ
�
</p>
<p>dC
</p>
<p>dQ

<p>dp
</p>
<p>dQ
�
</p>
<p>dC
</p>
<p>dQ
&frac14; 0: &eth;1:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here, Π again denotes profit per period (e.g. a year), Q production, C total
</p>
<p>production cost, and p the sales price. Equation (1.3) can be solved to yield
</p>
<p>dC
</p>
<p>dQ
&frac14; p&thorn; Q
</p>
<p>dp Q&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>dQ
&lt; p: &eth;1:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>Under atomistic competition each supplier determines its production according
</p>
<p>to the &ldquo;marginal cost&frac14; price&rdquo; rule (see Eq. 1.2). By way of contrast, the monopolist
has an incentive to observe the inequality &ldquo;marginal cost &lt; price&rdquo; by holding back
</p>
<p>its production in order to enforce a higher price. By holding back production, the
</p>
<p>monopolist in fact deprives some consumers of the good or service, although they
</p>
<p>are willing to pay a price that covers the extra cost of serving them. Therefore, this
</p>
<p>outcome cannot be (Pareto-) efficient.
</p>
<p>1.2.3 Energy Policy
</p>
<p>In cases where self-interested behavior of market participants alone fails to reach a
</p>
<p>Pareto-optimal state due to particularities of energy markets, the term &lsquo;market
</p>
<p>failure&rsquo; applies. Market failures are an argument for energy policy to intervene
</p>
<p>into markets in order to correct market failures. Ideally, a Pareto-optimal state can
</p>
<p>be achieved.
</p>
<p>Public energy policy has been in existence for a long time. Prior to the first oil
</p>
<p>price shock in 1973, its basic aim was to secure the supply of energy by stimulating
</p>
<p>investment in coal mining, oil extraction, power plants, as well as transmission and
</p>
<p>distribution grids. It was completed by government control of the safety and
</p>
<p>reliability of technical installations and of market power&mdash;with the exception of
</p>
<p>electricity, gas, and district heat where monopolies were even sometimes
</p>
<p>encouraged. Since 1973, energy policy has extended its scope. Triggered by the
</p>
<p>oil price shocks, the issue became securing the supply of energy, also by
</p>
<p>diversifying primary energy sources and transportation routes. In addition, energy
</p>
<p>saving and energy efficiency entered the political agenda. In the 1980s, the new
</p>
<p>themes were societal skepticism regarding nuclear power generation and the devel-
</p>
<p>opment of renewable energy supplies. Since the 1990s, the energy policy of many
</p>
<p>1.2 Why Energy Economics? 9</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>countries has been focusing on the liberalization of energy markets, abatement of
</p>
<p>greenhouse gas emissions, and sustainable development. Yet from the viewpoint of
</p>
<p>energy economics, the common theme of all these challenges and debates is the
</p>
<p>attempt to correct different types of market failure.
</p>
<p>To structure the debate, the so-called magical triangle shown in Fig. 1.2 has
</p>
<p>proved helpful. According to it, energy policy has a triple mission: It should secure
</p>
<p>the supply of energy, contribute to economic competitiveness, and render the use of
</p>
<p>energy compatible with the environment. While these objectives are generally
</p>
<p>accepted in principle, their pursuit by policy-makers meets with complications.
</p>
<p>Indeed, objectives can be related to each other in three different ways.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Complementarity: In this case, progress in the achievement of one objective
</p>
<p>contributes to the achievement of the other. An example is the positive impact of
</p>
<p>a more efficient energy use on the security of energy supply.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Neutrality: Progress in the achievement of one objective has no impact on the
</p>
<p>achievement of the other.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Antagonism: Progress in the achievement of one objective undermines achieve-
</p>
<p>ment of the other, forcing a trade-off on policy-makers. Trade-offs are typical for
</p>
<p>many decisions in energy policy, calling for their multi-criteria evaluation.
</p>
<p>Ideally, an objective function should be defined as the weighted sum of multiple
</p>
<p>target indicators with their weights reflecting individual preferences.
</p>
<p>If individuals in a society have significantly different preferences, social
</p>
<p>decision-making meets with great difficulty. First, individual preferences need to
</p>
<p>be consistent. Someone who ranks compatibility with the environment higher than
</p>
<p>security of supply and ranking it in turn higher than economic competitiveness, is
</p>
<p>expected to also rank compatibility with the environment higher than the economic
</p>
<p>competitiveness when the two are pitted against each other.
</p>
<p>But even when individual preferences are consistent, democratic decision-
</p>
<p>making used for their aggregation may lead to inconsistent social preferences.
</p>
<p>This was shown by Nobel Prize laureate Kenneth Arrow (1951) and can be

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>demonstrated simply for a society consisting of three individuals with three differ-
</p>
<p>ent preference orderings,
</p>
<p>&ndash; Individual 1: environment � competitiveness � supply security;
&ndash; Individual 2: competitiveness � supply security � environment;
&ndash; Individual 3: supply security � environment � competitiveness.
</p>
<p>Here, the sign &lsquo;�&rsquo; symbolizes &ldquo;strictly preferred to&rdquo;. Assuming democratic
majority voting on pairwise alternatives, the outcome is
</p>
<p>&ndash; environment versus competitiveness 2:1
</p>
<p>&ndash; competitiveness versus supply security 2:1
</p>
<p>An implication of these voting results is that compatibility with the environment
</p>
<p>is strictly preferred to supply security. However, a vote directly pitting supply
</p>
<p>security against the environment leads to the opposite preference ordering.
</p>
<p>&ndash; supply security versus environment 2:1
</p>
<p>This failure to achieve a consistent social preference ordering through simple
</p>
<p>majority voting has become known as the Arrow paradox. It is likely to occur in
</p>
<p>societies whose individual members and interest groups representing them have
</p>
<p>heterogeneous preferences. In this case, decision-making with respect to energy
</p>
<p>policy may be blocked, with the political debate producing no more than formal
</p>
<p>compromises, an outcome that can be often observed in real life.
</p>
<p>Governments may try to prevent the blockade by avoiding a vote on energy
</p>
<p>issues. However, there is also the alternative of so-called logrolling. In the example
</p>
<p>above, it is sufficient for one individual to modify his or her preference ordering to
</p>
<p>achieve consistency in the aggregate. This modification can be brought about by the
</p>
<p>promise to support the individual on another issue. Logrolling in parliament
</p>
<p>therefore permits to reach consistency of social preferences; yet it is viewed by
</p>
<p>suspicion by voters who fear that their delegates betray them in their own personal
</p>
<p>interest (they also may not attribute much importance to the other issue facilitating
</p>
<p>the logrolling).
</p>
<p>The Arrow paradox provides an explanation of the conditions that may lead to
</p>
<p>unsuccessful attempts at correcting failures in energy markets. Additionally, there
</p>
<p>is another problem. Political interventions are usually not costless. They require the
</p>
<p>gathering of information, impose costly controls, and may not be executed in an
</p>
<p>optimal manner. Selfish interests of political decision-makers and governmental
</p>
<p>institutions need to be taken into consideration as well, causing acts of energy
</p>
<p>policy not always to be in the overall interest of society. Therefore, the results of
</p>
<p>political intervention in energy markets may even be less Pareto-efficient than the
</p>
<p>situation without intervention, an outcome known as policy failure as opposed to
</p>
<p>market failure.
</p>
<p>1.2 Why Energy Economics? 11</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.3 History of Energy Economics
</p>
<p>Energy economics is a comparatively young field of teaching and research. Interest
</p>
<p>in it was triggered by an influential study published by the Club of Rome in 1972.
</p>
<p>Written by Dennis Meadows, it was titled &ldquo;The Limits to Growth&rdquo; (Meadows et al.
</p>
<p>1972). His work used approaches borrowed from system dynamics to predict the
</p>
<p>collapse of the world economy as a consequence of declining oil reserves and
</p>
<p>increasing emissions harmful to the environment. Shortly after this publication, the
</p>
<p>two oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979 appalled the world, seemingly confirming
</p>
<p>this pessimistic view.
</p>
<p>In response, a few economists began to develop new models, emphasizing the
</p>
<p>impact of price on the behavior of market participants. According to these models,
</p>
<p>the relative price of oil would have to rise, stimulating substitution processes long
</p>
<p>before the world runs out of oil. Therefore, the increase in the oil price was to be
</p>
<p>seen as a step towards the solution of the energy problem. In fact, global oil
</p>
<p>consumption began to decline, as predicted by the economic models. Among the
</p>
<p>best known contributions of the time are the Hudson-Jorgensen model (Hudson and
</p>
<p>Jorgenson 1974, 1978) and the ETA-MACRO model (Manne 1978). These and
</p>
<p>other early models improved the understanding of energy markets as well as the
</p>
<p>quality of recommendations guiding energy policy.
</p>
<p>With the drop of oil prices in early 1986, the attention shifted to environmental
</p>
<p>problems. From the economist&rsquo;s viewpoint it was obvious that the price mechanism
</p>
<p>should again help to solve them. Energy prices were to not only reflect cost as
</p>
<p>calculated by the energy industry but also the external costs associated with
</p>
<p>environmental damage caused by producing, transporting, and using energy.
</p>
<p>Energy economists put considerable effort into the conceptualization and quantifi-
</p>
<p>cation of externalities and their evaluation as external costs. Perhaps the most
</p>
<p>prominent study in this regard is the ExternE project sponsored by the European
</p>
<p>Union between the early 1990s and 2005. The fruit of these efforts was the
</p>
<p>introduction of ecological taxes followed by tradable emission rights, constituting
</p>
<p>an instance of successful energy policy consulting.
</p>
<p>Since its beginning in the 1970s, energy economics has also revolved around the
</p>
<p>analysis of institutions and rules governing energy markets, with market power in
</p>
<p>grid industries becoming a crucial topic. These activities resulted in concepts of
</p>
<p>competition and deregulation of grid industries, which started to be implemented by
</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margret Thatcher in the United Kingdom in
</p>
<p>the early 1980s. Another cornerstone was the European single electricity market
</p>
<p>directive (EU Directive 96/92/EC). With the implementation of this directive,
</p>
<p>European power markets changed faster than ever before in their history. A few
</p>
<p>years later, similar developments occurred in the European gas industry
</p>
<p>(EU Directive 98/30/EC).
</p>
<p>At present, ongoing reforms of electricity markets are not the only source of
</p>
<p>change affecting the energy industry. Volatile prices of fossil fuels and ever more
</p>
<p>frequent government interventions in terms of market regulation, emission trading,
</p>
<p>renewable energy, and capacity markets challenge actors in energy markets again
</p>
<p>12 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and again. Business concepts that have been successful in the past may turn out to
</p>
<p>be a recipe for future disaster. A high degree of adaptability, fast and smart
</p>
<p>decision-making, and vigorous action are required for energy companies to succeed
</p>
<p>in a market environment that is difficult to predict.
</p>
<p>In future, energy economics will be able to keep its consultancy role for business
</p>
<p>and public policy only by shifting its attention from processes of substitution to
</p>
<p>dynamic and complex processes of innovation. It was rather successful with its
</p>
<p>proposition that substitutability is the key to the solution of many energy problems.
</p>
<p>It has also been quite strong in elucidating the conditions that facilitate efficient
</p>
<p>solutions, e.g. in climate policy and renewable energy development. Given the
</p>
<p>recent acceleration of market dynamics, however, an understanding of the
</p>
<p>interactions between innovations and adaptive markets is critical. During the past
</p>
<p>40 years, energy economics has developed into something far more than a mere
</p>
<p>academic activity. It is about to become as relevant to public policy as monetary
</p>
<p>economics and public finance. May this book accompany its readers on this path.

<p>2.1 Energy and the Natural Sciences
</p>
<p>This section presents an overview of energy-related terminology and the role of
</p>
<p>energy in several scientific disciplines. It further highlights the many ways in which
</p>
<p>energy can be defined.
</p>
<p>2.1.1 Physics
</p>
<p>From the standpoint of physics, energy is defined as the ability to accomplish work
</p>
<p>(mechanical energy). The unit of measurement is the joule (1 J &frac14; 1 kg m2/s2). One
joule represents the work required to lift a body with a mass of 102 g � 1 m. This
amount of work is needed to overcome the Earth&rsquo;s gravitational force, resulting
</p>
<p>from the acceleration g &frac14; 9.807 m/s2 caused by the Earth (measured at the norm
location in Paris, France). In physics, force is equal to mass (kg) times its accelera-
</p>
<p>tion (m/s2), measured in Newton (N),
</p>
<p>1N &frac14; 1kg m=s2: &eth;2:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>Mechanical energy can exist as potential energy (e.g. water stored in a mountain
</p>
<p>reservoir) or as kinetic energy (e.g. a rotating turbine). The work performed per unit
</p>
<p>of time is called power and is measured in watts (W) or kilowatts (kW),
</p>
<p>1 kW &frac14; 1000
J
</p>
<p>s
&frac14; 1000 �
</p>
<p>kg m2
</p>
<p>s3
: &eth;2:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>A kilowatt hour (kWh) is the energy quantity released by a device working with
</p>
<p>a power of one kilowatt (kW) operating for one hour (h). This energy can be
</p>
<p>converted into joules (J) or megajoules (MJ) as follows,
</p>
<p>1 kWh &frac14; 3600 kWs &frac14; 3:6 � 106J &frac14; 3:6 MJ: &eth;2:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>A kilowatt year (kWa) is equal to 365 � 24&frac14; 8760 kWh or 31.54 � 109 J,
respectively.
</p>
<p>For thermal energy, the pertinent unit of measurement is the calorie (cal). A
</p>
<p>calorie equals the energy required to heat water with a mass of 1 g from 14.5 to
</p>
<p>15.5 �C. In comparison, the melting heat of (frozen) water is 80 cal/g, while the
</p>
<p>boiling heat is 539 cal/g.
</p>
<p>The relationship between mechanical and thermal energy was discovered by the
</p>
<p>Scottish physicist James Joule. It is governed by the principle of energy conserva-
</p>
<p>tion. He discovered that mechanical energy can be completely converted into heat
</p>
<p>(but not vice versa) which was one of the first principles of energy conservation.
</p>
<p>The conversion factor, the so-called heat equivalent of mechanical energy, is
</p>
<p>16 2 Energy in Science and Engineering</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 cal &frac14; 4:187 kJ or 1 kJ &frac14; 0:2366 cal: &eth;2:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, more principles of energy conservation were discov-
</p>
<p>ered, such as the principle of equivalence between energy and mass (as expressed in
</p>
<p>the formula of Albert Einstein E&frac14;mc2) and the quantum law of radiant energy
(radiation law of Max Planck e&frac14; hν with Planck&rsquo;s constant h and the frequency of
radiation ν).
</p>
<p>The physical knowledge of energy can be summarized by the two laws of
</p>
<p>thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics states that in closed systems,
</p>
<p>the total amount of energy is constant. The following forms of energy can be
</p>
<p>distinguished.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Mechanical energy: energy capable of performing work, also called exergy,
</p>
<p>among others orderly kinetic energy;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Chemical energy: bond energy of molecules (Coulomb force);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Electrical energy: energy of electromagnetic fields;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Thermal energy: kinetic energy of atoms and molecules;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Radiant energy: energy through radiation (if energy in form of photons impacts
</p>
<p>matter, the energy is absorbed or reflected; the absorbed energy can be further
</p>
<p>transformed into internal heat or transformed in chemical processes,
</p>
<p>e.g. photosynthesis);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Nuclear energy: energy of mass (so-called mass defect).
</p>
<p>According to the first law of thermodynamics and contrary to common language,
</p>
<p>energy can neither be created nor consumed but only transformed. For example,
</p>
<p>there are processes such as those for transforming the chemical energy stored in
</p>
<p>fossil fuels into kinetic or thermal energy. What is consumed therefore is the energy
</p>
<p>source. The share of the stored energy that can be transformed into work (rather
</p>
<p>than dissipated heat) is called exergy, while the share that cannot be transformed
</p>
<p>into work is called anergy.
</p>
<p>The second law of thermodynamics states that the energy capable of performing
</p>
<p>work gradually decreases in a closed system (law of the increase of entropy). Rather
</p>
<p>than being based on macroscopic deterministic relationships, the second law of
</p>
<p>thermodynamics is derived from probabilistic information (so-called statistical
</p>
<p>mechanics) about microscopic details. More precisely, the second law of thermo-
</p>
<p>dynamics reflects the high degree of freedom in thermodynamic systems with its
</p>
<p>many atoms or molecules. However, it is applicable only to closed systems (Nicolis
</p>
<p>and Prigogine 1977). Thermodynamically, the globe is an open system in which
</p>
<p>entropy can decrease, for example through the storage of solar radiation in fossil
</p>
<p>energy sources.

<p>2.1.2 Chemistry
</p>
<p>The chemical view of energy is connected to the physical principles of energy
</p>
<p>conversion. However, its focus is more on the outcome of specific energy conver-
</p>
<p>sion processes. A particularly important chemical transformation process is com-
</p>
<p>bustion (oxidation). The result of this (so-called exothermic) process is molecules
</p>
<p>with lower bond energy (known as Coulomb force) compared to the bond energy of
</p>
<p>the original molecules. Examples of these transformation processes are the com-
</p>
<p>bustion of carbon (C atom) and hydrogen (H atom),
</p>
<p>1 kg C&thorn; 2:7 kg O2 ! 3:7 kg CO2 &thorn; 32:8 � 10
6J
</p>
<p>1 kg H2 &thorn; 7:9 kg O2 ! 8:9 kg H2O&thorn; 142 � 10
6J
</p>
<p>&eth;2:5&THORN;
</p>
<p>While hydrogen reacts with oxygen and burns producing water vapor, the
</p>
<p>combustion of carbon-based fuels with oxygen leads to the formation of carbon
</p>
<p>dioxide (CO2) in a (stoichiometric) ratio of 3.7 kg CO2 per kg carbon. In these
</p>
<p>combustion processes, energy (measured in joule J) is released.
</p>
<p>Vice versa, many chemical processes only take place if energy is added
</p>
<p>(so-called endothermic processes). This includes the opposite reactions of combus-
</p>
<p>tion processes, e.g. when producing hydrogen. Electrolysis of hydrogen requires
</p>
<p>energy in the form of electricity. Regarding the steam reforming of natural gas
</p>
<p>(methane CH4) to hydrogen, the following chemical reaction takes place,
</p>
<p>1 kg CH4 &thorn; 2:2 kg H2O&thorn; 15:8 � 10
6J ! 2:7 kg CO2 &thorn; 0:5 kg H2: &eth;2:6&THORN;
</p>
<p>Therefore, the production of 1 kg H2 through steam reforming calls for an energy
</p>
<p>input of 31.6�106 J and releases 5.4 kg CO2.
</p>
<p>2.1.3 Biology
</p>
<p>From a biological perspective, energy transformation is closely linked to photosyn-
</p>
<p>thesis and cell respiration. In photosynthesis, solar radiation (energy in the form of
</p>
<p>photons) is used to break up carbon dioxide and water molecules (CO2 and H2O), as
</p>
<p>well as to transform them into hydrocarbon compounds (e.g. carbohydrates) with
</p>
<p>higher bond energy through the release of oxygen. In this process, chlorophyll acts
</p>
<p>as the catalyst.
</p>
<p>In the case of cell respiration, chemical energy of organic hydrocarbon
</p>
<p>compounds is transformed in a combustion process involving oxygen. Energy
</p>
<p>flows in the living human body serve as a quantitative example. The metabolic
</p>
<p>rate of a human body at rest is approximately 80 watt (W), 20 W of which is
</p>
<p>accounted for by human brain. At normal everyday physical activity, the total
</p>
<p>metabolic rate is 100&ndash;120 W. Because this average is in use during 24 h per day,
</p>
<p>a daily energy intake of 2.4&ndash;2.9 kWh (or 2000&ndash;2500 kcal, respectively) is neces-
</p>
<p>sary. In addition, humans can perform physical labor with 100W for a few hours. In
</p>
<p>18 2 Energy in Science and Engineering</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>this case, the required energy intake increases by at least 0.5 kWh for every hour of
</p>
<p>physical labor.
</p>
<p>According to Table 2.1, mules, bullocks, and horses have a higher capacity for
</p>
<p>physical labor than humans. This is why they have been very valuable to mankind
</p>
<p>for many millennia. Before the industrial revolution, an estimated 30% of agricul-
</p>
<p>turally usable surfaces in Central Europe were used for supplying energy to pack
</p>
<p>and draught animals.
</p>
<p>The figures cited can be used to calculate the biological energy needed for
</p>
<p>maintaining a world population of about 7.4 bn humans. The required annual
</p>
<p>quantity of energy amounts to some 0.74 � 1012 kWh per year or 910 mn tons of
crude oil equivalent (toe, see Table 2.2). For comparison, current oil consumption is
</p>
<p>about 35 bn bbl or 3.63 bn toe annually, i.e. the fourfold of the energy needed for
</p>
<p>nutrition (see IEA 2016). This energy is provided through food in the form of high-
</p>
<p>grade biomass, which is obtained from about 5 bn toe of biomass per year harvested
</p>
<p>worldwide through farming and fishing.
</p>
<p>2.2 Engineering and Energy
</p>
<p>Being available in several forms, energy can be measured in different units. In
</p>
<p>energy engineering, focus is on the development, construction, and operation of
</p>
<p>equipment and devices designed to transform energy. The need to measure their
</p>
<p>performance has resulted in statistical concepts and information that are indispens-
</p>
<p>able for energy economics.

<p>2.2.1 Energy Units
</p>
<p>What is considered as an energy source from an engineering standpoint depends on
</p>
<p>the technical knowledge about how to make use of its energy content, as well as on
</p>
<p>the (economic and social) willingness to make use of it. For instance, uranium oxide
</p>
<p>(U3O8) has only become an energy source with the invention of the controlled
</p>
<p>fission of uranium isotopes 235U.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, there is a multitude of energy sources. In order to compare them, it
</p>
<p>is necessary to convert their specific energy contents into a common energy unit.
</p>
<p>While the joule (J) is the base unit for energy of the International System of Units
</p>
<p>(SI for Système International d&rsquo;Unités in French) and the appropriate unit in
</p>
<p>physics, several industry-specific energy units are in use. Some of the more
</p>
<p>common are:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Tons of coal equivalent (1 tce &frac14; 29.3 GJ);
&ndash; Tons of oil equivalent (1 toe &frac14; 41.87 GJ);
&ndash; Barrels of crude oil (1 bbl &frac14; 159 l crude oil): 1 bbl is equivalent to 5.7 GJ
</p>
<p>(approximation: 1 bbl &frac14; 50/365 toe);
&ndash; Standard cubic meter of natural gas (at a temperature of 0 �C and a pressure of
</p>
<p>1.013 bar, 1 m3 natural gas &frac14; 36.43 MJ);
&ndash; British Thermal Unit (BTU): 1 BTU represents the energy required to heat 1 lb
</p>
<p>of water by 1�F (1 BTU &frac14; 1055 J). For larger energy quantities there are the
British therm (thm), with 1 thm &frac14; 105 BTU &frac14; 105.5�106 J &frac14; 29.31 kWh and the
quad unit (1 quadrillion BTU) with 1 quad &frac14; 1015 BTU.
</p>
<p>Instead of decimal powers, the following symbols are often used:
</p>
<p>exa (E) 1018
</p>
<p>peta (P) 1015 femo (f) 10&ndash;15
</p>
<p>tera (T) 1012 pico (p) 10&ndash;12
</p>
<p>giga (G) 109 nano (n) 10&ndash;9
</p>
<p>mega (M) 106 micro (μ) 10&ndash;6
</p>
<p>kilo (k) 103 milli (m) 10&ndash;3
</p>
<p>Table 2.2 shows some basic conversion factors between these units. Its first three
</p>
<p>rows and columns represent energy units that are based on definitions in physics.
</p>
<p>The units in the last three rows and columns are derived from fossil energy sources
</p>
<p>that occur in nature. Because of the different properties of geological deposits,
</p>
<p>reference is made to tons of oil equivalent (toe) instead of tons of oil, and tons of
</p>
<p>coal equivalents (tce) instead of tons of coal.
</p>
<p>The conversion factors exhibited in Table 2.2 are based on lower heating values
</p>
<p>(Hi). The lower heating value is the quantity of energy that is released during a
</p>
<p>complete combustion, net of the energy needed for the condensation of the steam
</p>
<p>contained in the exhaust gas (so-called condensate enthalpy), assuming an exhaust
</p>
<p>gas temperature of 25 �C. By way of contrast, the upper heating value (Hs) includes
</p>
<p>the energy contained in the condensate enthalpy. The difference between these two
</p>
<p>values depends on the water content in the exhaust gas and ranges between 5 and
</p>
<p>30%, depending on the energy source. The usable energy of a combustion process is
</p>
<p>20 2 Energy in Science and Engineering</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>generally indicated by the lower heating value, which is used in most energy
</p>
<p>statistics. Exceptions are the energy statistics of the United States and those of
</p>
<p>the natural gas sector, where upper heating values are traditionally used.
</p>
<p>2.2.2 Energy Conversion
</p>
<p>There are many technical processes for the conversion of energy, some of which are
</p>
<p>listed in Table 2.3. In order to perform work, energy needs to be available in
</p>
<p>so-called transient form. For example, a temperature differential is necessary to
</p>
<p>convert thermal into mechanical energy. A wide variety of energy in transient form
</p>
<p>occurs in nature, such as rivers, wind, and geothermal heat. Fossil as well as nuclear
</p>
<p>energy sources, in contrast, are only capable of performing work after one or more
</p>
<p>conversion processes. In the course of these conversion processes, part of the
</p>
<p>energy content turns into heat rather than work.
</p>
<p>The thermodynamics of energy conversion can be explained using the example
</p>
<p>of a steam engine (see Fig. 2.1). Water or another medium is heated in the left

<p>chamber through the combustion of a fossil fuel. There, the increase in temperature
</p>
<p>causes pressure to increase (assuming that the volume in the chamber remains
</p>
<p>constant). This follows from the equation of state (here simplified for an ideal gas),
</p>
<p>P V
</p>
<p>ϑ
&frac14; constant &eth;2:7&THORN;
</p>
<p>with pressure P (measured in Pascal), volume V (measured in cubic meter), and
</p>
<p>temperature ϑ (measured in Kelvin, where 1 K&frac14; &ndash;273 �C). The piston moves to the
right until pressure in the two chambers is equalized. This movement amounts to a
</p>
<p>release of mechanical energy (top of Fig. 2.1). In modern heat engines, the
</p>
<p>equalization of pressure drives a turbine, which is subject to a smaller loss of
</p>
<p>exergy caused by friction than a piston.
</p>
<p>The potential to convert the energy in the left chamber into mechanical energy is
</p>
<p>exhausted as soon as pressure and counter-pressure are equalized by the movement
</p>
<p>of the piston. Equivalently, the temperature in the heated chamber adjusts to the
</p>
<p>temperature on the other side. An excess of energy E4 &gt; E2 (in the guise of heat) is
created in the process of the decompression on the other side of the piston (the
</p>
<p>turbine, respectively). This excess thermal energy needs to be dissipated to permit
</p>
<p>continuous operation of the heat engine. In large thermal power plants, cooling
</p>
<p>towers are used for this purpose.
</p>
<p>Evidently, the usable mechanical energy converted by such a heat engine is
</p>
<p>substantially lower than the amount of energy contained in the fuel. An inverse
</p>
<p>measure of technical conversion losses is the efficiency factor,

<p>theoretical fuel efficiency of ω&frac14; 80%. Currently, actual fuel efficiency is about
60%.
</p>
<p>The traditional goal of energy engineering has been to attain the highest possible
</p>
<p>efficiency in the provision of energy. Of course, the thermodynamic laws and
</p>
<p>constraints cannot be transcended.

<p>2.3 Energy Balance
</p>
<p>To obtain a quantitative overview of a country&rsquo;s energy economy, one makes use of
</p>
<p>the information made available by statistical offices, business associations, energy
</p>
<p>companies, and research institutions. A particularly important data source is the
</p>
<p>energy balance, which provides a comprehensive overview of a country&rsquo;s flows of
</p>
<p>energy.1 The energy balance documents the overall supply and use of the different
</p>
<p>energy sources during a given period of observation.
</p>
<p>Energy flow charts are often used to illustrate an energy balance. A simplified
</p>
<p>example of an energy-importing country is shown in Fig. 2.2. The widths of the
</p>
<p>arrows reflect the country&rsquo;s energy structure. The terms used as well as their
</p>
<p>interpretation are explained below.
</p>
<p>2.3.1 Gross Energy (Primary Energy)
</p>
<p>The available gross energy of a country consists of domestic energy sources plus
</p>
<p>energy imports minus exports. Sometimes, the expression &lsquo;total primary energy
</p>
<p>supply&rsquo; (TPES) is used, although this is not entirely correct. Primary energy
</p>
<p>consists of those energy sources that have not undergone any transformation
</p>
<p>process, e.g. crude oil or coal. In contrast, energy sources that have undergone at
</p>
<p>least one transformation process are called secondary energy. Due to growing

<p>1In the context of accounting and economics, the term &lsquo;balance&rsquo; is used for stock quantities.
</p>
<p>Energy balances however represent aggregated flows per period, typically a year. Their equivalent
</p>
<p>in accounting is the income statement.
</p>
<p>2.3 Energy Balance 23</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>imports of secondary energies such as gasoline or electricity, the expression &lsquo;total
</p>
<p>primary energy supply&rsquo; is becoming increasingly inaccurate.
</p>
<p>After subtraction of conversion and transportation losses as well as
</p>
<p>non-energetic uses from gross energy, one obtains total final energy consumption
</p>
<p>(TFC). Total final energy consumption amounts to the energy delivered to end users
</p>
<p>for energy purposes. In industrialized countries, it traditionally equals commercial
</p>
<p>energy sold by energy companies. However, end users might also have access to
</p>
<p>non-commercial energy, e.g. from self-collected firewood or solar collectors.
</p>
<p>Because of the difficulties of measurement, most data regarding non-commercial
</p>
<p>energy are estimates.
</p>
<p>Table 2.4 shows the basic structure of an energy balance, using the European
</p>
<p>Union as an example. The table consists of three matrices. The upper section
</p>
<p>contains domestic gross energy supply by origin and energy source. Nuclear fuels
</p>
<p>are traditionally classified as a domestic energy source even though most of them
</p>
<p>are imported. The reason for this international convention is that nuclear fuels are
</p>
<p>usually stored within the country over a period of several years. From a supply
</p>
<p>policy perspective, nuclear fuels can therefore be considered equivalent to a
</p>
<p>domestic energy source.
</p>
<p>The middle section of the energy balance shows how the available domestic
</p>
<p>supply of gross energy is transformed into secondary energy. The columns again
</p>
<p>report the primary energy sources, whereas the rows list the transformation
</p>
<p>technologies. Negative entries reflect energy inputs, positive ones, outputs after
</p>
<p>transformation. Therefore, horizontal summation results in energy loss attributable
</p>
<p>to the corresponding transformation technology (see the last column). The third row
</p>
<p>explicitly reports statistical differences originating from inconsistencies in the data
</p>
<p>sources. Furthermore, the two rows towards the bottom in the middle section
</p>
<p>exhibit the energy industry&rsquo;s own use of energy and its losses (e.g. due to transpor-
</p>
<p>tation), respectively.
</p>
<p>The row entitled &lsquo;total final consumption&rsquo; (TFC) results from the vertical
</p>
<p>summation of the two upper sections of the energy balance. Comparing this row
</p>
<p>with the Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES), one can deduce the energy &lsquo;lost&rsquo; in
</p>
<p>transformation and transportation processes. In the case of the European Union (see
</p>
<p>Table 2.4), about 70% of primary energy is available to final consumers.
</p>
<p>However, statements of this type must be interpreted with great care. While
</p>
<p>assessing final energy provided by nuclear, hydro, wind, or solar power plants is
</p>
<p>rather straightforward, statistically specifying their primary energy supply is chal-
</p>
<p>lenging. There are three main approaches to deduce primary energy supply from
</p>
<p>final energy.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The substitution principle: One derives primary energy supply from final energy
</p>
<p>assuming that it was transformed in a typical conventional thermal plant. Often,
</p>
<p>the average fuel efficiency of installed thermal capacities (for electricity usually
</p>
<p>around 35&ndash;40%) is used to derive a primary energy supply.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The efficiency principle: Here, one uses the actual efficiency of the respective
</p>
<p>transformation technology to derive the primary energy supply from the final
</p>

<p>energy (e.g. up to 36% for nuclear power, approximately 80% for hydro pump
</p>
<p>storage, 10&ndash;25% for photovoltaic systems, and up to 55% for wind turbines).
</p>
<p>&ndash; The fictive efficiency factor principle: According to this principle, electricity
</p>
<p>from renewables and from imported power is treated as a primary energy source.
</p>
<p>Thus, an efficiency factor of 100% is implicitly assumed. As a consequence, the
</p>
<p>share of renewable energies in total primary energy supply (TPES) is
</p>
<p>underestimated.
</p>
<p>The three approaches lead to very different estimates of total primary energy
</p>
<p>supply, limiting the comparability of energy balances between countries or cover-
</p>
<p>ing different time periods. For detailed analysis, it is absolutely necessary to check
</p>
<p>the approach used.
</p>
<p>2.3.2 Final Energy Consumption
</p>
<p>The lower part of the energy balance (see Table 2.4) indicates total final energy
</p>
<p>consumption (TFC) by consumer group, e.g. industry, transportation, commercial,
</p>
<p>and residential consumers. Also, non-energy uses are singled out in the bottom row.
</p>
<p>Note that this classification differs from that used in national accounts and other
</p>
<p>sources of macroeconomic data (see Table 2.8). An example is fuel consumption
</p>
<p>for road transportation, which should be allocated to business (passenger and
</p>
<p>freight traffic) and private households, respectively for national accounting. Energy
</p>
<p>balances fail to make this distinction because filling stations do not differentiate
</p>
<p>between their customers.
</p>
<p>2.3.3 Data Sources
</p>
<p>There is an abundance of publicly available energy statistics (particularly on the
</p>
<p>internet). A recognized data source for primary energy supply by individual
</p>
<p>countries and world regions is the annual BP Statistical Review of World Energy,
</p>
<p>published by the British Petroleum group. In addition, the International Energy
</p>
<p>Agency (IEA), the American Department of Energy (DOE) and the statistical office
</p>
<p>of the European Union (Eurostat) publish statistical material regarding the interna-
</p>
<p>tional energy economy, e.g. the development of energy prices. Information about
</p>
<p>the consumption of non-commercial energy can be found in the annual World
</p>
<p>Development Report of the World Bank.
</p>
<p>The purpose of energy balances is to obtain information on the structure and the
</p>
<p>development of technical energy systems. As an example, Table 2.5 shows figures
</p>
<p>on global primary energy supply, which have been calculated according to the
</p>
<p>substitution principle. In the 1950s, coal was still the most important energy source.
</p>
<p>Currently, crude oil dominates the global energy system, but its share is declining in
</p>
<p>favor of coal. The shares of natural gas, hydropower, and nuclear energy are mostly
</p>
<p>26 2 Energy in Science and Engineering</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>stable. While non-commercial sources such as firewood and dung are still important
</p>
<p>in developing countries, they are not included in Table 2.5.
</p>
<p>2.3.4 Useful Energy (Net Energy) and Energy Services
</p>
<p>From both the engineering and the economic perspective, final energy is an
</p>
<p>intermediary good. It is used by energy-converting devices, machines, and facilities
</p>
<p>to perform useful function. The main purpose of final energy is the utility it creates,
</p>
<p>such as
</p>
<p>&ndash; heat (e.g. space heating, hot water, high and low-temperature process heat);
</p>
<p>&ndash; work (e.g. transportation, information and communication, cooling);
</p>
<p>&ndash; light (e.g. lighting, laser technology);
</p>
<p>&ndash; chemically bound energy (e.g. electrolysis, reduction processes in batteries).
</p>
<p>For obtaining utility from final energy, end users operate boilers, motors,
</p>
<p>lighting systems, air conditioners, furnaces, etc., generally on their own account.
</p>
<p>Just like in any other conversion process, operation of these devices goes along with
</p>
<p>losses, particularly in the form of unused heat. The statistical recording of these
</p>
<p>losses is difficult because there is no stringent definition of useful energy (also
</p>
<p>called net energy). An example is the measurement of heat provided by a central
</p>
<p>heating system. Should this heat be measured at the exit of the burner or at the
</p>
<p>radiator? While the heat distribution losses are included in the first case, they are
</p>
<p>excluded in the second.
</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;energy service&rsquo; takes the concept of useful energy even further. The
</p>
<p>idea is that it is not the warm radiator or hot water that is ultimately demanded but
</p>
<p>rather a pleasantly heated room or a well-formed piece of steel. These examples
</p>
<p>show that not only the technology matters (e.g. thermal insulation standard,
</p>
<p>optimized design of engine performance), but also the behavior of the final energy
</p>
<p>user. An example is a short and intense instead of a long and moderate airing of a

<p>room which might ultimately lead to the same level of utility for the consumer but
</p>
<p>with lower energy consumption.
</p>
<p>Traditional energy balances do not include useful energy and energy services
</p>
<p>because the appropriate figures cannot be observed on market. However, according
</p>
<p>to estimates, significant conversion losses occur at final energy users. From a
</p>
<p>macroeconomic point of view, the share of primary energy in useful energy and
</p>
<p>energy services is estimated to lie between 10 and 20%. If it were possible to further
</p>
<p>minimize the conversion losses along the entire value chain linking primary energy
</p>
<p>sources to energy services, total energy expenditure would significantly decrease
</p>
<p>with an unchanged level of energy services. Additionally, energy-related environ-
</p>
<p>mental damages and greenhouse gas emissions would also be mitigated.
</p>
<p>2.4 Cumulated Energy Requirement
</p>
<p>The cumulated energy requirement (CER) of goods and services is defined as the
</p>
<p>sum of the total primary energy amount required for the production (CERP), the use
</p>
<p>(CERU), and the disposal (CERD) over the entire lifetime of the product (so-called
</p>
<p>life-cycle assessment):
</p>
<p>CER &frac14; CERP&thorn;CERU&thorn;CERD: &eth;2:10&THORN;
</p>
<p>The cumulated energy requirement is used as an indicator for the assessment of
</p>
<p>measures to reduce the energy consumption of buildings, vehicles, and appliances.
</p>
<p>Reductions in energy consumption during the use of an appliance could e.g. be
</p>
<p>cancelled by an increase in the process of its production. Countervailing
</p>
<p>developments of this type need to be considered when assessing energy-saving
</p>
<p>measures.
</p>
<p>Other instances are solar and wind power plants. While their operation requires
</p>
<p>almost no energy, their construction does. The energy payback time is defined as
</p>
<p>the operating time of a plant needed to recover the energy amount for their
</p>
<p>construction and disposal. The harvesting factor, or &lsquo;energy returned on energy
</p>
<p>invested&rsquo;, respectively, indicates how often a plant recovers the CER during its
</p>
<p>lifetime.
</p>
<p>The CER concept is also helpful for an in-depth assessment of a country&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>technical energy flows. While its energy balance documents immediate energy
</p>
<p>flows within its confines, it does not account for the energy used in the production
</p>
<p>of imported goods (so-called &lsquo;gray energy&rsquo;; see Spreng 1988). Countries with high
</p>
<p>energy prices tend to outsource the production of energy-intensive goods, resulting
</p>
<p>in a decrease in their primary energy demand but without an effect on its global
</p>
<p>amount. It is the calculation of the CER that makes such facts transparent.
</p>
<p>In general, there are two different methods to calculate the CER, process chain
</p>
<p>analysis and energy input-output analysis. Process chain analysis is a detailed
</p>
<p>assessment of energy inputs at each stage, from production to disposal of a good
</p>
<p>(see Frischknecht et al. 1994). This method is relatively simple to apply if the
</p>
<p>necessary data is available. Table 2.6 shows an example using the results of the
</p>
<p>28 2 Energy in Science and Engineering</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>GEMIS model developed by IWU Darmstadt (Fritsche et al. 1999). According to
</p>
<p>this model, the supply of 1 kWh of heating oil requires 1.13 kWh of primary energy,
</p>
<p>while the supply of 1 kWh of electricity requires about 2.22 kWh of primary energy
</p>
<p>(in the case of Germany). The third column of Table 2.6 indicates the greenhouse
</p>
<p>gas emissions (in CO2 equivalents).
</p>
<p>However, it is impossible to take all of the economic interdependencies in the
</p>
<p>production of a good into account in this way. At some point, process chain analysis
</p>
<p>must stop, resulting in errors which can be avoided using the method of energy
</p>
<p>input-output analysis.
</p>
<p>2.5 Energy Input-Output Analysis
</p>
<p>Input-output analysis is based on the division of the national economy into eco-
</p>
<p>nomic sectors. The goods and services that are exchanged between these sectors are
</p>
<p>summarized in input-output tables. The sectors are defined by homogeneous prod-
</p>
<p>uct groups (so-called functional differentiation), in contrast to national accounts,
</p>
<p>where they are defined institutionally.2
</p>
<p>Table 2.7 contains a greatly simplified example of an input-output table with five
</p>
<p>sectors, two of which are energy sectors. Here, transactions are valued at production
</p>
<p>cost net of value-added taxes and excise duties such as taxes on mineral oil or
</p>
<p>tobacco. Imports are valued at cif-prices (including cost, insurance, and freight),
</p>
<p>exports, at fob-prices (free on board). Trading margins are registered as an output of
</p>
<p>the service sector.
</p>
<p>The rows of an input-output table show the value of a sector&rsquo;s deliveries to
</p>
<p>economic sectors (so-called first quadrant or intermediate consumption matrix) and
</p>
<p>to final consumers.3 For example, companies producing oil, gas, and coal had sales
</p>
<p>of 0.09 monetary units (MU) to other companies in the same sector and of 0.07 MU

</p>
<p>2In an institutional differentiation of sectors, companies are consolidated into sectors following
</p>
<p>their main focus of economic activity.
3Final consumption consists of private consumption, public consumption and investment, exports,
</p>
<p>and stock changes.

<p>to electricity generators. However, the largest demand came from final consumers
</p>
<p>with 5.72 MU, bringing the total of deliveries (so-called gross output) to 13.10 MU.
</p>
<p>The columns show the cost of production factors of each sector consisting of
</p>
<p>purchases from economic sectors (again shown in the first quadrant or intermediate
</p>
<p>consumption matrix) and primary inputs.4 Companies producing oil, gas, and coal
</p>
<p>bought 0.07 MU of it from other companies in the same sector but only 0.01 MU
</p>
<p>from electricity generators. Of course, imports loom large with 8.16 MU, while
</p>
<p>wages and salaries paid for the purchase of labor amount to a mere 0.83 MU. In
</p>
<p>total, inputs amount to 13.10 MU.
</p>
<p>Note that for every sector, the sum of its row entries (sales revenues) is equal by
</p>
<p>definition to the sum of its column entries (expenditures and profits), reflecting
</p>
<p>equality of the two sides of a company&rsquo;s income statement.
</p>
<p>Input-output tables are published by statistical offices in regular or irregular
</p>
<p>intervals, usually with a delay of several years. For the European Union, Eurostat is
</p>
<p>in charge, for the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Depart-
</p>
<p>ment of Commerce (BEA).
</p>
<p>The cells printed in bold of Table 2.7 relate to the economy&rsquo;s energy sector. If
</p>
<p>they are in energy rather than monetary units, the table becomes an energy input-
</p>
<p>output table (see the example shown in Table 2.8). Its source is the energy balance,
</p>
<p>transposed and structured to conform to the division of the economy in sectors.
</p>
<p>Average prices of the energy supplied to the other sectors and for final consumption
</p>
<p>can be calculated by dividing the sales revenues of the monetary input-output table
</p>
<p>by the corresponding energy flows of the energy input-output table.
</p>
<p>Input-output tables can be used as a basis for input-output models. The most
</p>
<p>important variant is associated with the Russian economist and Nobel laureate
</p>
<p>Wassily Leontief (1970). With N sectors, total output of each sector Xi (the gross
</p>
<p>output of sector i &frac14; 1,. . ., N in monetary units) can be expressed by the following
core equation of the Leontief input-output model,
</p>
<p>Xi &frac14;
X
</p>
<p>N
</p>
<p>j&frac14;1
</p>
<p>Xij &thorn; Fi, i &frac14; 1 . . . ;N&eth; &THORN;, &eth;2:11&THORN;
</p>
<p>where Xij represents deliveries from sector i to sector j and Fi final demand for
</p>
<p>goods or services in sector i.
</p>
<p>The linear Leontief input-output model is based on the assumption that
</p>
<p>relationships between the sector inputs Xij and outputs Xi are constant, at least in
</p>
<p>the short term. These constant relationships are expressed by input coefficients,
</p>
<p>4Primary inputs consist of imports, cost of capital (depreciation, interests, and profits), cost for
</p>
<p>labor (wages and salaries, including surcharges for social security), and indirect taxes (excluding
</p>
<p>subsidies).

<p>Thus, the ratio of inputs to outputs in production is predetermined and fixed by
</p>
<p>the prevailing technology. In this case, the production function is of fixed
</p>
<p>proportions or Leontief type. The input coefficients aij represent the average
</p>
<p>production technology characterizing sector j during the period of observation.
</p>
<p>Substitution processes between inputs driven e.g. by changing input prices or new
</p>
<p>technologies, are not taken into consideration in Eq. (2.12). Possibilities to relax

<p>this very restrictive assumption are discussed at the end of this section.

<p>The coefficients fij (elements of the inverted matrix in Eq. (2.15)) are called
</p>
<p>Leontief multipliers. They indicate by how many monetary units (MU) gross
</p>
<p>production of sector i needs to expand if final demand of sector j increases by
</p>
<p>one MU.
</p>
<p>The Leontief multipliers pertaining to the input-output Table 2.7 are given in
</p>
<p>Table 2.9. Note that the values on the diagonal all exceed 1. For instance, if power

<p>generators are to produce one extra MU worth of electricity, they trigger an extra
</p>
<p>demand of 1.041 MU worth of electricity in their own sector because they have to
</p>
<p>e.g. employ more workers who in turn use more electricity. Moreover, they call on
</p>
<p>additional inputs provided by the service sector, which adds another 0.155 MU
</p>
<p>worth of power. The sum of column entries indicates that if the country&rsquo;s demand
</p>
<p>for electricity increases by one MU, national production of electricity must increase
</p>
<p>by the equivalent of 1.352 MU.
</p>
<p>Using the input-output table, the energy requirements of products and services
</p>
<p>can be estimated. First, direct energy coefficients ekj are calculated from the energy
</p>
<p>input-output table for all M energy sectors,

<p>Summation of ekj over theM energy sectors yields ej, which indicates how much

</p>
<p>Up to this point, the energy requirements of non-energy imports (known as gray
</p>
<p>energy) and the energy contained in the depreciation of capital have been neglected.
</p>
<p>Both can be estimated using data from input-output tables. In order to estimate the
</p>
<p>gray energy, consider the row &lsquo;imports&rsquo; (in MU) of Table 2.7. To deduce the energy
</p>
<p>requirements for these imported goods, the cumulated energy requirement (CER)
</p>
<p>needs to be calculated from the input-output tables of the corresponding exporting
</p>
<p>countries. In practice, these estimates are limited to the most important countries of
</p>
<p>origin.
</p>
<p>The energy content of used-up capital can be derived from the row &lsquo;deprecia-
</p>
<p>tion&rsquo; of Table 2.7. Here, the assumption is made that the energy directly and
</p>
<p>indirectly required for the production of capital goods needs to be accounted for
</p>
<p>only when they are depreciated. The correct approach would be an estimation using
</p>
<p>input-output tables of past years.
</p>
<p>Despite the elegance of the input-output model, the assumption of fixed
</p>
<p>proportions in production according to Eq. (2.12) presents a serious shortcoming.
</p>
<p>It can be neglected when calculating the CER for a particular year. However, for
</p>
<p>other energy economic purposes, a dynamic input-output table may be necessary. In
</p>
<p>this case, the sectoral consistency condition must absolutely be satisfied which
</p>
<p>states that the sum of sectoral inputs (in MU) is equal to the sum of sectoral outputs
</p>
<p>(in MU). Generally, there are two different ways to satisfy this condition:
</p>
<p>&ndash; The input coefficients can be adjusted over time according to specific changes in
</p>
<p>sectoral production processes. For example, nuclear power plants may be
</p>
<p>substituted by gas-fired ones. For determining the macroeconomic consequences
</p>
<p>of this substitution, one has to first define the cost structure of the two types of
</p>
<p>power plant as two column vectors in the input-output table. From this, the
</p>
<p>changed cost structure of the electricity sector can be simulated, using exoge-
</p>
<p>nously given shares of nuclear and gas-fired plants in electricity production.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Input coefficients can also be made flexible using economic models, with
</p>
<p>changes in the relative prices of inputs serving as an explanatory variable.
</p>
<p>These prices depend on the sectoral development of wages and productivities
</p>
<p>as well as changes in indirect taxes and import prices. The first empirical study
</p>
<p>adopting this approach was the Hudson-Jorgenson model for the United States
</p>
<p>(Hudson and Jorgenson 1974). Later studies are referred to as computable
</p>
<p>general equilibrium (CGE) models (see Shoven and Whalley 1992).

<p>Investment and Profitability Calculation 3
</p>
<p>Capital budgeting and profitability accounting are necessary for assessing the
</p>
<p>economic viability of energy investments. Although the methodology for energy
</p>
<p>investments does not differ fundamentally from other applications, there are unique
</p>
<p>problems associated with it due to some particularities of investment in energy
</p>
<p>technologies. Long planning, construction, and operation periods make the result of
</p>
<p>an investment decision strongly dependent on the discounting of future cash flows.
</p>
<p>These facts motivate consideration of the following issues:
</p>
<p>&ndash; What is the meaning of (net) present value of a flow of revenues (expenditures,
</p>
<p>respectively)?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Why is the interest rate especially important in investment projects relating to
</p>
<p>energy and what determines this rate of interest?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How can one account for future inflation (deflation, respectively)?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Would it be preferable to abstain from discounting altogether, in the interest of
</p>
<p>sustainability?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What insights can be gleaned from recent developments in the theory of finance?

</p>
<p>3.1 Basics
</p>
<p>Financial appraisal techniques require a forecast of future flows of costs and
</p>
<p>revenues over the lifetime of the investment. In this regard, only those costs and
</p>
<p>revenues that are directly linked to the planned investments are to be considered.
</p>
<p>For example, in the decision process of retrofitting a power plant, the initial
</p>
<p>construction cost of the plant is irrelevant; only the additional costs and revenues
</p>
<p>caused by the upgrade should be taken into account. Likewise, in a short-term
</p>
<p>production decision (&ldquo;Should the existing power plant increase its rate of produc-
</p>
<p>tion?&rdquo;), only the associated additional costs affect its outcome. The most important
</p>
<p>cost components are:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Additional costs for fuel and emission rights, depending, among other things, on
</p>
<p>output-related fuel efficiency;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Accelerated degradation of the installation due to thermal stress resulting from
</p>
<p>temperature change in boilers and pipes;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Fuel losses during start-up and shut-off periods.
</p>
<p>The sum of these costs divided by the additional production is the marginal unit
</p>
<p>cost that describes the economic impact on the plant operator if production is to
</p>
<p>increase or decrease by one unit. The investment outlay and other expenditures that
</p>
<p>are not affected by the production decision, such as personnel and administration,
</p>
<p>are irrelevant for the evaluation of short-term production decisions.
</p>
<p>For the evaluation of a long-term investment decision, again only those eco-
</p>
<p>nomic variables that might be affected by it have to be considered. If a company
</p>
<p>plans for an incremental expansion of capacity, the cost of management should be
</p>
<p>excluded, for example. However, the additional expected sales revenues per period
</p>
<p>generated by the investment are relevant. They depend on:
</p>
<p>&ndash; The capacity Cap to be installed (measured for example in tons of output per day
</p>
<p>or in megawatt of electricity);
</p>
<p>38 3 Investment and Profitability Calculation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ndash; The capacity factor ν, specifying the average expected percentage of annual full-
</p>
<p>load operation1;
</p>
<p>&ndash; The average expected price of energy sales pE.
</p>
<p>With power plant capacity denoted by Cap (measured in MW), annual output
</p>
<p>and corresponding annual sales revenues are calculated as follows,
</p>
<p>Q &frac14; Cap � ν � 8760 &eth;3:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>pE � Q &frac14; pE � Cap � ν � 8760&eth; &THORN; &eth;3:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>The financial counterpart of annual sales revenues are the expected future annual
</p>
<p>costs, which can be divided into a variable and a fixed cost component. Variable cost
</p>
<p>Cvar includes the cost of intermediate inputs such as annual expenses for raw
</p>
<p>materials, fuels, emission rights, waste disposal, and to some extent also wages
</p>
<p>(given flexible employment contracts). When dividing expected variable cost by
</p>
<p>expected output Q, one obtains variable cost per unit output cvar&frac14; Cvar/Q. The fixed
cost amounts to the annualized investment outlay. The ratio, fixed cost/variable cost
</p>
<p>is an indicator of the capital intensity of an investment project. The contribution
</p>
<p>margin is defined as the difference between annual revenue and annual variable cost.
</p>
<p>For investment decisions, investment outlay Inv including the cost of financing
</p>
<p>must be compared to the annual expected cash flows or contribution margins,
</p>
<p>respectively, during the project&rsquo;s lifetime. In a simplified analysis, one assumes
</p>
<p>the investment outlay to take place in period t0, leading to a negative cash flow Inv0
in this period. In the following years, the cash flows are given by ( pEt � cvar,t)�Qt.
They should predominantly be positive in order to make the project economically
</p>
<p>viable. The time horizon is the end of the project&rsquo;s economic life T.
</p>
<p>A time series of annual cash flows can only be meaningfully evaluated if their
</p>
<p>individual values are referenced to the period in which the investment is undertaken
</p>
<p>(t &frac14; 0). The resulting quantity is called Net Present Value (NPV). It is given by
</p>
<p>NPV &frac14; � Inv0 &thorn;

1&thorn; i&eth; &THORN;t
</p>
<p>: &eth;3:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>The (real, inflation-adjusted) interest rate i discounts all future cash flows; it is
</p>
<p>therefore called discount rate. The term (1+i)&ndash;t is referred to as the discount factor.
</p>
<p>Discounting reflects the fact that a cash flow that occurs later in time has a
</p>
<p>reduced value. If funds are received early, they can be re-invested to generate
</p>
<p>additional revenue. Assuming a common interest rate i for borrowing and lending,
</p>
<p>the re-invested funds increase by (1+i) within 1 year.2 Conversely, the present value
</p>
<p>1A year has 24�365 &frac14; 8760 h (8784 h in a leap year). Thus a capacity factor of v &frac14; 20% equals
0.2�8760 &frac14; 1752 full load operation hours.
2The assumption that borrowing and lending occur at the same rate is equivalent to the assumption
</p>
<p>of perfect capital markets. Another important proposition is that all transactions are free of costs

<p>of one monetary unit received (or paid, respectively) 1 year from now amounts to

<p>1/(1+i). At an interest rate of 5% e.g., this is 0.952 monetary units because

<p>0.952�1.05 &frac14; 1. By analogy, funds received 2 years hence have a present value of
1/(1+i)2.
</p>
<p>If annual cash flows remain constant over the entire life of the project, Eq. (3.3)
</p>
<p>can be rewritten to become

<p>value becomes zero. Figure 3.1 shows a fictitious example resulting in

<p>IRR &frac14; 11.5%.
&ndash; By solving Eq. (3.4) for the energy price pE, one obtains the break-even price
</p>

<p>Figure 3.2 shows how this break-even price depends on project life T and the
</p>
<p>discount rate i. The figure assumes costs that are typical of an investment in
</p>
<p>onshore wind power. As long as break-even price pE exceeds the wholesale
</p>
<p>price of power, the investment is not competitive. However, the government
</p>
<p>may mandate electrical grid operators to purchase e.g. wind power at a fixed
</p>
<p>feed-in tariff. In this case, wind power installations become virtually economic if
</p>
<p>their break-even prices are below the fixed feed-in tariff. Other support schemes
</p>
<p>such as market premiums3 and investment subsidies may have similar effects on
</p>
<p>investment in wind power and other renewables.
</p>
<p>&ndash; By solving Eq. (3.4) for T, one obtains the break-even payback time T*. This is
</p>
<p>the time needed for recovery of a given investment outlay including compound
</p>
<p>interest through future revenues. For simplification, introduce AN &frac14; ( pE� cvar)�

<p>3.2 Interest Rate and Price of Capital
</p>
<p>Due to the long-term character of most investment in the energy sector, the
</p>
<p>result of a financial appraisal is greatly affected by a variation of the discount
</p>
<p>rate i. The choice of the discount rate must therefore be well-founded, calling
</p>
<p>for an understanding of the nature of interest rates and of the key variables
</p>
<p>influencing them.
</p>
<p>According to economic theory, the interest rate amounts to the price for
</p>
<p>obtaining funds for a specified time; thus, short-term interest rates generally differ
</p>
<p>from long-term ones. In the following, a contract duration of 1 year is assumed.
</p>
<p>Since lenders have no access to their money during this time, they expect investors
</p>
<p>to provide an appropriate financial incentive in addition to a compensation for the
</p>
<p>risk that the creditor may default. As in any other market, price is determined by the
</p>
<p>intersection of supply and demand so that the market is cleared. Supply of capital is
</p>
<p>provided by savings, while demand originates with entrepreneurs in need of funds
</p>
<p>to finance their investments.
</p>
<p>The supply of savings importantly depends on the (marginal) time preference of
</p>
<p>consumers qs. They are willing to abstain from one unit of consumption at time t0 if
</p>
<p>they can consume at least (1+qs) units in the next period t1. Thus qs is referred to as
</p>
<p>the (marginal) rate of substitution between present and future consumption. As long
</p>
<p>as the yield on savings outweighs this rate (i&gt; qs), individuals will normally
4 delay
</p>
<p>consumption, permitting them to offer funds on the capital market up to the point
</p>
<p>where i &frac14; qs.
The demand for capital depends on the expected return on investment (ROI). It
</p>
<p>increases as long as ROI exceeds the rate of interest i investors have to pay for
</p>
<p>funds. Equilibrium is reached where ROI (which equals the internal rate of return of
</p>
<p>the last (marginal) investment project, denoted by IRR) is just enough to cover the
</p>
<p>cost of funds, thus where i &frac14; IRR.
Since both saving and investment are influenced by the market interest rate, the
</p>
<p>interest rate balances the two, causing supply of and demand for capital to match
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 3.3). Assuming a perfect, fully transparent capital market without transac-
</p>
<p>tion costs, equilibrium yields
</p>
<p>qs &frac14; qi &frac14; i &frac14; ROI &frac14; IRR: &eth;3:12&THORN;
</p>
<p>The importance of the cost of capital for the macroeconomic assessment of an
</p>
<p>energy investment is illustrated by the following example. At decision time t0, let
</p>
<p>the project call for investment outlay of 1 EUR; therefore, other economic sectors
</p>
<p>must reduce consumption or investment by the same amount. Let the project have a
</p>
<p>benefit of G(t1) EUR in the next period t1, expressed in additional consumption
</p>
<p>4This holds provided the substitution effect&mdash;the incentive to move consumption from today to
</p>
<p>tomorrow holding wealth constant&mdash;outweighs the wealth effect of interest and dividend
</p>
<p>payments, which may induce consumers to consume, i.e. to reduce saving.
</p>
<p>44 3 Investment and Profitability Calculation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>possibilities. Focusing on private consumption for simplicity, one can say that the
</p>
<p>project has a positive effect on the economy as long as its net present value
</p>
<p>(discounted using time preference qs of savers) is greater than the loss in terms of
</p>
<p>current consumption caused by the drain on capital. This condition can be written as
</p>
<p>G(t1) &amp;gt; 1+qs.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, realization of the project may &lsquo;squeeze out&rsquo; investment
</p>
<p>elsewhere in the economy. This occurs if it yields a return above the ROI of
</p>
<p>competing projects, which is the case if G(t1) &amp;gt; 1+ROI. In a perfect capital
</p>
<p>market, equality (3.12) shows that a sacrifice in terms of current consumption and
</p>
<p>current investment lead to the same conclusion: The opportunity cost of a project is
</p>
<p>independent of the way it is financed because its benefits (returns, respectively) as
</p>
<p>well as costs should be discounted using the market interest rate.
</p>
<p>3.3 Inflation-Adjusted Interest Rate
</p>
<p>For the evaluation of long-term investments, expected future inflation must be taken
</p>
<p>into account (past inflation is irrelevant for a decision concerning the future). If
</p>
<p>nothing else changes, inflation causes nominal costs and revenues to increase over
</p>
<p>time. Let its expected rate Δpe/p be the same for both unit variable cost cvar and
</p>
<p>price pE. If in addition it is constant over the entire planning period, inflation can be
</p>
<p>introduced into net present value calculation in the following simple way,
</p>
<p>pE, t &frac14; pE � 1&thorn;
Δpe
</p>
<p>p
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>&eth;1&thorn; i&THORN;t
: &eth;3:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>As long as the future expected rate of inflation is low (below 10%, say), this
</p>
<p>equation can be approximated by
</p>
<p>NPV � � Inv0 &thorn; &eth;pE � cvar&THORN; � Q �

</p>
<p>1
�
</p>
<p>1&thorn; &eth;i� Δpe=p&THORN;
�t &eth;3:15&THORN;
</p>
<p>Accordingly, inflation effects can be accounted for by subtracting the expected
</p>
<p>inflation rate Δpe/p from the rate of discount rate. Accordingly, one defines an
</p>
<p>expected real rate of discount,
</p>
<p>ie :&frac14; i� Δp
e
</p>
<p>p
&eth;3:16&THORN;
</p>
<p>to be used in discounting inflation-adjusted cash flows and costs. Conversely,
</p>
<p>Eq. (3.16) states that the nominal market rate of interest rate i is the sum of the
</p>
<p>real rate ie (which in turn equals time preference of savers who are interested in real
</p>
<p>rather just nominal consumption) and the expected rate of inflation Δpe/p.
</p>
<p>Inflation confers an advantage on owners of physical assets, which appreciate in
</p>
<p>value. Conversely, creditors suffer to an equivalent degree. Therefore, inflation
</p>
<p>gains and losses correspond to each other. Suppose that consumers, expecting an
</p>
<p>inflation rate of 3%, would like to see their real consumption possibilities increase
</p>
<p>by 5% within a year, equal to their rate of time preference. They then would ask for
</p>
<p>a nominal interest rate of 3+5 &frac14; 8%. Investors who expect that their net revenues
will also rise in correspondence to the inflation rate would be willing to pay
</p>
<p>that rate.
</p>
<p>Yet on closer inspection, this line of argument is short-sighted. Neither creditors
</p>
<p>nor investors are immune to erroneous predictions. The greater the uncertainty
</p>
<p>about future inflation rates, the greater the risk to lenders of capital. If they should
</p>
<p>underestimate the real rate of inflation, they may end up with a negative real rate of
</p>
<p>interest and hence reduced rather than enhanced consumption possibilities. Taking
</p>
<p>such risk into account, lenders may ask for a risk premium, resulting in a still higher
</p>
<p>nominal rate of interest. Alternatively, they may place their savings in tangible
</p>
<p>assets such as gold and other precious metals rather than the capital market. For this
</p>
<p>reason alone, economists widely view inflation as something that should be
</p>
<p>avoided. Moreover, they fear its tendency to accelerate once inflationary
</p>
<p>expectations are built into wage negotiations and pricing decisions, resulting in
</p>
<p>the so-called wage-price spiral.

<p>3.4 Social Time Preference
</p>
<p>When evaluating energy investments with an economic life of 40 years or more, high
</p>
<p>discount rates have a strongly negative effect on the viability of a project. This is
</p>
<p>because cash flows occurring late in time are reduced to just about zero in present value
</p>
<p>through discounting. Capital-intense investments in renewable energy or in energy
</p>
<p>efficiency are affected in particular because their evaluation depends on the expecta-
</p>
<p>tion that the real price of conventional fuels rises over time. However, the Hotelling
</p>
<p>rule of Sect. 6.2.1 predicts that this rise is no faster than the real rate of interest. If the
</p>
<p>ROI currently applied by investors exceeds this rate (for instance because they are
</p>
<p>skeptical about the longer-term prospects of the economy, causing their planning
</p>
<p>horizon to be short), future cash flows contribute little to net present value.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the discount rate can be interpreted as the market&rsquo;s &lsquo;shortsightedness&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Figure 3.4 illustrates this. An investor assuming an interest rate of 4% discounts
</p>
<p>1 EUR of cash flow that comes in after 40 years according to the formula of
</p>
<p>compound interest, resulting in
</p>
<p>1

&frac14; 1
</p>
<p>1:0440
&frac14; 0:208: &eth;3:17&THORN;
</p>
<p>Therefore, only 20% of this cash flow contributes to the project&rsquo;s NPV. If the
</p>
<p>investor applies an interest rate of 8%, this contribution is reduced to even less than
</p>
<p>5%. Evidently, the higher the discount rate, the less likely is a positive NPV for a
</p>
<p>project with a long life such as 40 years, ceteris paribus. Short-term projects have a
</p>
<p>better chance. Thus, one can say that high rates of discount cause investors to
</p>
<p>become myopic.

<p>From a macroeconomic point of view, the question arises whether investments
</p>
<p>that have the benefit of sustainability should not be evaluated using a lower social
</p>
<p>rather than the market discount rate. In the scientific literature, lower values and
</p>
<p>even a zero value for the discount rate have been proposed (see Lind et al. 1982),
</p>
<p>partly on philosophical rather than strictly economic grounds:
</p>
<p>&ndash; The human being is in a permanent conflict between the subconscious (consid-
</p>
<p>ered to be irrational) and the conscious (associated with rationality). The irratio-
</p>
<p>nal part seeks the fast, instant satisfaction of desires, while mid-term or even
</p>
<p>long-term projects require a higher tolerance of frustration. The interest rate is
</p>
<p>the economic equivalent of this behavioral fact but in the end reflects irrational
</p>
<p>myopia. Pigou (1932) called this effect &lsquo;defective telescopic faculty&rsquo;; Harrod
</p>
<p>(1948) referred to it as &lsquo;pure time preference&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The choice of a social discount rate can be seen as the outcome of a negotiation
</p>
<p>between different social groups. In the case of long-term projects in the interest
</p>
<p>of sustainability, relevant stakeholders such as future generations are not
</p>
<p>represented at the negotiating table, causing the outcome to be distorted if
</p>
<p>present market conditions and in particular the market discount rate are used
</p>
<p>for the evaluation of these projects.
</p>
<p>&ndash; In addition to their pure time preference reflected by market behavior, citizens of
</p>
<p>today may have diverging social rates of time preference. This is expressed on the
</p>
<p>political level; people may want the government to take responsibility for future
</p>
<p>generations but are not willing to include it in their individual decisions. They use a
</p>
<p>social discount rate when participating in political referendums on projects in the
</p>
<p>interest of society. Since voters differ with respect to this rate, it is themedian voter
</p>
<p>(who turns a minority into a majority in a two-party system) who determines the
</p>
<p>social discount rate. This rate (implicit in the outcome of pertinent referenda) may
</p>
<p>be used for calculating the net present value of long-term projects.
</p>
<p>&ndash; A similar argument can be derived from the distribution ofwealth, which is heavily
</p>
<p>skewed in most societies. Wealthy individuals, disposing of substantial capital
</p>
<p>funds, influence the market interest rate more than poor ones. When deciding on
</p>
<p>projects in the interest of the society and of future generations, democratic decision
</p>
<p>rules require that poor individuals have the same weight as wealthy individuals.
</p>
<p>Although those arguments seem reasonable at first glance, one should be careful to
</p>
<p>promote the use of social discount rates that are different from the market interest rate
</p>
<p>when it comes to evaluating energy investments of public interest. A low social
</p>
<p>discount rate would indeed support &lsquo;sustainability projects&rsquo;. Yet projects of this type
</p>
<p>could be harmful to future generations because they need to be financed by government,
</p>
<p>private investors requiring a ROI in excess of the social rate of discount. To the extent
</p>
<p>that government debt increases, future generations are burdened with a debt that can be
</p>
<p>substantial in view of the high capital intensity of these projects. Indeed, future capital
</p>
<p>costs could outweigh the benefits of the project to them.An artificially lowdiscount rate
</p>
<p>thusmay run counter the good intentions of their promoters in the long run; the way to a
</p>
<p>more sustainable development cannot be cleared by manipulating the discount rate.
</p>
<p>48 3 Investment and Profitability Calculation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>More generally, a basic principle of economic policy applies in this context. The
</p>
<p>Dutch Nobel prize laureate Tinbergen (1967) realized the analogy between a
</p>
<p>system of equations and the relationships linking a set of objectives to a set of
</p>
<p>policy instruments. The objectives can be viewed as dependent variables and the
</p>
<p>policy instruments, as arguments in a system of equations. A policy maker who
</p>
<p>wants to know how to reach his or her objectives needs to solve for the arguments;
</p>
<p>however, an equation system generally has a solution only if the number of
</p>
<p>functional relationships and hence arguments is at least as large as the number of
</p>
<p>dependent variables (for instance, a system of two unknowns can be solved only if
</p>
<p>there are at least two equations). This implies that by using only a single control
</p>
<p>variable such as the discount rate, policy makers cannot simultaneously attain the
</p>
<p>two goals of maximum inter-temporal efficiency (i.e. a high productivity of invest-
</p>
<p>ment) and maximum inter-generational distributional justice.
</p>
<p>Through some of its economic activities, the present generation puts the livelihood
</p>
<p>of future generations at stake. This can be counteracted by the introduction of funda-
</p>
<p>mental rights of future generations to live in an unspoiled and livable environment on a
</p>
<p>par with the (constitutional) human rights of the current generation. These fundamental
</p>
<p>rights should not be discounted when deciding investment projects. However, long-
</p>
<p>term investment projects that do not affect them should be discounted using themarket
</p>
<p>interest rate, with inflationary expectations taken into account as shown in Sect. 3.3.
</p>
<p>3.5 Interest Rate and Risk
</p>
<p>For most real-world investment, knowledge about future returns is limited. They
</p>
<p>are subject to a multitude of risks:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Engineering and construction risks;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Financial risks;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Technical risks during operation;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Customer risks (e.g. default of payments, declining demand);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Supplier risks (e.g. supply interruptions);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Price and exchange rate risks;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Social risks (e.g. strikes);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Political risks (market interventions).
</p>
<p>Investors may try to quantify these risks by defining a set of possible scenarios,
</p>
<p>assigning to them subjective probabilities wk describing the likelihood of
</p>
<p>occurrence,
</p>
<p>0 � wk � 1, k, k &frac14; 1::::,N, with
XN
</p>
<p>k&frac14;1
wk &frac14; 1: &eth;3:18&THORN;
</p>
<p>3.5 Interest Rate and Risk 49</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In the limiting case, one of the scenarios has a probability of one while all other
</p>
<p>probabilities are zero. This is the case of certainty.
</p>
<p>Applied to investment decisions, for each scenario k a rate of return on invest-
</p>
<p>ment ROIk is calculated. The expected rate of return is given by
</p>
<p>E&eth;ROI&THORN; &frac14;
XN
</p>
<p>k&frac14;1
ROIk � wk &eth;3:19&THORN;
</p>
<p>and the associated variance, by
</p>
<p>σ2 &frac14;
XN
</p>
<p>k&frac14;1
&eth;ROIk � E&eth;ROI&THORN;&THORN;2 � wk: &eth;3:20&THORN;
</p>
<p>In the case of certainty, variance σ2 is zero. The risk of a project increases with σ2
</p>
<p>(or with raising standard deviation σ, respectively).
</p>
<p>To the extent that market participants are risk-averse, they ask for a risk
</p>
<p>premium in addition to the rate of return pertinent to a corresponding risk-free
</p>
<p>investment.5 Thus, investment decisions under risk take not only the expected rate
</p>
<p>of return E(ROI) of the project into account, but also its uncertainty, usually
</p>
<p>reflected by variance σ2. According to the Bernoulli criterion, investors maximize
</p>
<p>a linear combination of expected profit and variance of profit
</p>
<p>E&eth;ROI&THORN; � av
2
σ2 ! max!: &eth;3:21&THORN;
</p>
<p>The term av denotes the individual&rsquo;s degree of risk aversion av � 0 (see also
Sect. 11.3). Thus, Eq. (3.21) describes a trade-off between expected value and
</p>
<p>variance of returns promised by a project: Given av &gt; 0, a project with higher
expected profit is only preferable to a project with lower expected profit if it does
</p>
<p>not have the downside of a higher variance of profits.
</p>
<p>3.5.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
</p>
<p>Up to this point, an investment project has been assessed in isolation. However,
</p>
<p>investors usually have a whole portfolio of project, providing them with the
</p>
<p>possibility of risk diversification (Markowitz 1952). This means that they evaluate
</p>
<p>a project not only in terms of its contribution to the overall expected return but also
</p>
<p>its contribution to the overall risk of their portfolio. In view of the trade-off
</p>
<p>discussed above, a single project may even lower the portfolio&rsquo;s expected rate of
</p>
<p>return provided it reduces the variance of the portfolio&rsquo;s return to a sufficient
</p>
<p>5Risk-aversion exists if a possible loss has a higher influence on utility than a gain of equal size and
</p>
<p>equal probability of occurrence.

<p>degree. This is possible if the project considered has a higher return than expected
</p>
<p>precisely when others perform worse than expected, and vice versa. Therefore,
</p>
<p>deviations from E(ROI) values of the project considered need to be negatively
</p>
<p>correlated with the ROI of the portfolio as a whole. Since a correlation coefficient is
</p>
<p>nothing but a normalized covariance, it is sufficient to calculate the covariance
</p>
<p>between the project&rsquo;s rate of return and the return of the entire portfolio held by the
</p>
<p>investor. For simplicity, investors are assumed to hold all assets traded on the capital
</p>
<p>market in proportion to their aggregate share, which is possible by buying stock of
</p>
<p>listed companies. Moreover, let the probabilities wk,j defined over the K scenarios of
</p>
<p>the project considered and the J scenarios of the market portfolio qmarket,j be the same.
</p>
<p>This is not unrealistic since the ROI values of individual investment projects and
</p>
<p>those pertaining to listed companies tend to move in parallel in response to the
</p>
<p>business cycle. With these simplifications, covariance is given by
</p>
<p>COV &frac14;

<p>k&frac14;1

<p>XJ
</p>

</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>� wk, j: &eth;3:22&THORN;
</p>
<p>Thus, the deviations from expected values of ROIweighted by their probability of
</p>
<p>occurrence are summed up. Accordingly, COV can be positive (positive
</p>
<p>correlatedness,making some limited risk diversification possible; see below), negative
</p>
<p>(enabling marked risk diversification), or zero (enabling risk diversification especially
</p>
<p>for large portfolios). Note that calculating COV is confronted with at least three
</p>
<p>challenges. First, the relevant market portfolio needs to be defined. Frequently, the
</p>
<p>stock exchange of the investor&rsquo;s resident country has been used; however, especially
</p>
<p>big investors increasingly seek risk diversification across national capital markets.
</p>
<p>Second, the time window used for estimation makes a considerable difference. In
</p>
<p>particular, estimates of E(ROI) and COV depend strongly on how many years prior to
</p>
<p>the financial crisis of 2007&ndash;2009 are included in the sample. Third,COV values usually
</p>
<p>are employed for guidance 1 year ahead, sometimes even only a quarter into the future.
</p>
<p>Planning horizons this short do not match the long life of a typical energy investment.
</p>
<p>With these caveats in mind, one can use the Capital Asset Pricing Model
</p>
<p>(CAPM) for determining the risk-adjusted rate of return required of an individual
</p>
<p>investment project ROI* in case the investor&rsquo;s portfolio consists of very many

<p>describes the relationship between the ROI of the project and the ROI pertinent to
</p>
<p>the capital market (in fact, it is nothing but the slope parameter of a linear regression
</p>
<p>linking ROIk to ROImarket). Note that investors&rsquo; risk aversion has no influence. Five
</p>
<p>cases can be distinguished.
</p>
<p>&ndash; β &frac14; 0: The project&rsquo;s rate of return is uncorrelated with the reference market
return. According to the CAPM, no risk premium is required for such an
</p>
<p>investment project, since the risk associated with the project is fully diversified
</p>
<p>away. Accordingly, returns can be discounted using the risk-free interest rate i.
</p>
<p>The yield of government bonds6 is often used as an indicator of the &lsquo;risk-free&rsquo;
</p>
<p>market interest rate.
</p>
<p>&ndash; β &frac14; 1: The project&rsquo;s expected rate of return fluctuates in parallel with the
reference market portfolio. With β &frac14; 1, the CAPM Eq. (3.23) implies E
(ROI) &frac14; E(ROI)market: The project bears the same systematic risk as the general
market portfolio and should therefore yield the same return.
</p>
<p>&ndash; 0 &lt; β &lt; 1: The ROI values of the project fluctuate less strongly than those of the
market portfolio; the project contributes to risk diversification. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>appropriate value of the discount rate is below E(ROI)market. Until recently,
</p>
<p>power plant projects used to be of this type. Electricity demand is rather stable,
</p>
<p>largely independent of economic cycles; moreover, in a regulated monopolistic
</p>
<p>market, investors typically obtain the right to adjust rates in order to achieve a
</p>
<p>guaranteed ROI on their projects.
</p>
<p>&ndash; β &gt; 1: In the wake of liberalization, this case has become more common in the
energy sector, reflecting an increase in riskiness due to competition. Since a
</p>
<p>higher required ROI* reflects a shortened panning horizon (see Sect. 3.4) the
</p>
<p>discount rate applied to energy investments varies with it. Therefore, under a
</p>
<p>regulated monopoly, the appropriate value of the discount rate is below E
</p>
<p>(ROI)market, while for companies operating in a liberalized electricity market,
</p>
<p>it is in excess of E(ROI)market.
</p>
<p>&ndash; β &lt; 0: The ROI values of the project are negatively correlated with those of the
capital market. One could say that the project in fact insures against the volatility
</p>
<p>of the capital market since its ROI is high when ROI values are low in general
</p>
<p>(and vice versa). An example could be a renewable energy project, whose
</p>
<p>earnings are particularly high when conventional energy sources become scarce
</p>
<p>and expensive, thus putting pressure on the ROI of listed companies who have to
</p>
<p>buy electricity. According to Eq. (3.23) the discount rate can even be below than
</p>
<p>the risk-free interest rate i in this case.
</p>
<p>6The yield of a bond is defined as its internal rate of return calculated by setting all discounted cash
</p>
<p>flows from that bond equal to its current market value.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.5.2 New Asset Pricing Methods
</p>
<p>In recent decades, the methods of risk-based evaluation of investment projects have
</p>
<p>been developed further. The point of departure is present value calculation, which
</p>
<p>however suffers from neglecting risks inherent in all components of future cash
</p>
<p>flows, such as sales prices, sales volumes, prices paid for energy inputs, and
</p>
<p>operating costs. Moreover, these components of cash flow cannot be assumed to
</p>
<p>be subject to the same risk. For example, if the energy company strikes a long-term
</p>
<p>sales contract with a reliable counterparty, the risk associated with future revenue is
</p>
<p>a minor one; at the very least, it can be assessed with some accuracy at the time of
</p>
<p>deciding about an investment.7 However, future production costs may also be
</p>
<p>uncertain; for instance, a generator using gas as a fuel is exposed to the risk of
</p>
<p>price hikes. Present value calculation can be extended to take into account risks
</p>
<p>inherent in cash flow component by component (this is also known as Asset Pricing
</p>
<p>Method). Cash flow components assumed to be devoid of risk are evaluated
</p>
<p>according to the risk-free rate of return i.
</p>
<p>Consider the sale of electricity in a future period T. Rather than selling on the
</p>
<p>(wholesale) market at the uncertain price prevailing at T, the generator can hedge
</p>
<p>the price risk by selling forward. This means striking a contract specifying delivery
</p>
<p>of QT units (MW) electricity in period T at the forward price pF, which is usually
</p>
<p>comparatively low because the buyer acts as an insurer (see Sect. 12.2.5). The
</p>
<p>present value of the forward contract is
</p>
<p>PV &frac14; pF QT
1
</p>
<p>1&thorn; i&eth; &THORN;T�t
, &eth;3:25&THORN;
</p>
<p>with i denoting the risk-free interest rate since it is now the counterparty who bears
</p>
<p>the price risk.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the generator can decide to bear the price risk, hoping that the spot
</p>
<p>price in period T will be higher than the current price. The first step is to replace the
</p>
<p>future spot price by its expected value, E[pE,T]. However, the issue remaining is
</p>
<p>how to discount a risky future sales price to present value. As stated above, the
</p>
<p>forward sales price is usually relatively low. Therefore, the ratio pF/pE is substan-
</p>
<p>tially below one if buyers and sellers on the forward market deem the price risk to
</p>
<p>be important. Indeed, the forward price represents the best estimate of a risk-
</p>
<p>adjusted future spot price. Evidently, the ratio pF/pE takes the price risk into
</p>
<p>account. Hence, Eq. (3.25) can be rewritten as follows,
</p>
<p>7More generally, there is so-called counterparty risk, meaning that a contractual partner fails to
</p>
<p>fulfill the contract. Sometimes counterparty risk can be transferred to a third party. For example, a
</p>
<p>company may sell power through an energy exchange. In this case, the exchange covers the
</p>
<p>counterparty risk, acting as a clearing house.

</p>
<p>the risk-free rate because the price risk has been already corrected for.
</p>
<p>The Asset Pricing Method assumes a market without transaction costs, permit-
</p>
<p>ting to switch freely between spot trades and forward contracts. In addition, cost of
</p>
<p>carry and convenience yield are neglected.8 Their inclusion in the economic
</p>
<p>evaluation of investment projects is beyond the scope of this book, being the subject
</p>
<p>of ongoing research.
</p>
<p>3.6 Real Option Valuation
</p>
<p>Investment decisions are based on several assumptions that need to be scrutinized.
</p>
<p>Uncertainties characterizing them can be taken into account using the correction
</p>
<p>factors discussed in the preceding sections or sensitivity analysis. A particular
</p>
<p>problem is that the risk factors can change during a project&rsquo;s lifetime, a fact that
</p>
<p>has not been considered thus far. At the same time, investors may react with more or
</p>
<p>less flexibility to these changes. This flexibility needs to be integrated into the
</p>
<p>evaluation of an investment in ways to be expounded here.
</p>
<p>According to Myers (1974), a project offering flexibility during its lifetime can
</p>
<p>be viewed as an option. This insight permits to apply financial option theory to the
</p>
<p>evaluation of physical investments, with the term &lsquo;real option&rsquo; used to distinguish
</p>
<p>them from a financial option. The theory of real options has been developed starting
</p>
<p>in the mid-1990s (see Laughton 1998) and has found its way into project manage-
</p>
<p>ment since. Pioneers in adoption were energy companies with activities in mining
</p>
<p>and extraction (crude oil, coal, and natural gas in particular). These companies had
</p>
<p>gained a lot of experience in trading financial derivatives on commodity exchanges
</p>
<p>designed to hedge the risk of volatile sales prices on wholesale markets. While a
</p>
<p>detailed description of real option theory is beyond the scope of this book, some of
</p>
<p>its basics shall be discussed. For an introduction to the topic, the work of Dixit and
</p>
<p>Pindyck (1994) serves as the standard reference.
</p>
<p>8Cost of carry refers to interest income forgone by receiving the sales revenue later (the cost of
</p>
<p>storage is of little relevance in the context of electricity). The convenience yield comprises all
</p>
<p>positive effects that are related to the physical possession of a good, in particular the option of
</p>
<p>selling it when its price is high.

<p>outcome. The outcome the bet is placed upon is called underlying. For instance,
</p>
<p>in the case of an option (of the call type, see below) which entitles its owner to
</p>
<p>buy 1000 bbl of crude oil at the end of next year at a price of 80 USD/bbl, the
</p>
<p>underlying is 1000 bbl of crude oil possibly worth 80,000 USD.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Derivatives: This term refers to all types of contracts that are not executed &lsquo;on
</p>
<p>the spot&rsquo; (i.e. delivery now, payment with minimum delay). Derivatives include
</p>
<p>forward contracts (delivery delayed, payment now or possibly delayed some-
</p>
<p>what) and options (delivery at the discretion of the buyer or seller, payment of an
</p>
<p>option premium now, remainder later).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Call option: This option entitles its holder to the right, but not the obligation, to
</p>
<p>buy the underlying at a specified price (the so-called strike price) during a
</p>
<p>limited time specified in the contract (so-called time to maturity). The seller of
</p>
<p>the option (called option writer) is obliged to sell the underlying when the buyer
</p>
<p>exercises the option but keeps the underlying in case the option holder fails to
</p>
<p>exercise it. Option writers charge an option premium to compensate them for the
</p>
<p>risky position they take in the meantime.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Put option: This is the opposite of a call option. It entitles the option holder to the
</p>
<p>right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying at a specified price (strike
</p>
<p>price) during a limited time specified in the contract (time to maturity). The
</p>
<p>option writer is obliged to buy the underlying at the demand of the option holder
</p>
<p>but does not have to if the option holder fails to exercise it. Option writers also
</p>
<p>ask for an option premium to compensate them for the risky position the take in
</p>
<p>the meantime.
</p>
<p>Besides applying classical strategies of risk mitigation (such as diversification),
</p>
<p>holders of a financial option can actually benefit from risk thanks to the flexibility
</p>
<p>offered by an option (see the discussion below). However, flexibility is not costless.
</p>
<p>Whether paying the option premium is justified depends on the value of flexibility to
</p>
<p>the option holder. Investments in projects which increase the ability to adapt flexibly
</p>
<p>to changes in market conditions are similar to financial options, except that they are
</p>
<p>&lsquo;real&rsquo; in the sense of being written on tangible underlyings such as gas turbines. As
</p>
<p>will be shown in greater detail below, options are particularly valuable if
</p>
<p>&ndash; the economic viability of the project depends on exogenous influences whose
</p>
<p>future development is highly uncertain;
</p>
<p>&ndash; the company pursuing the project is able to react to these uncertainties in a
</p>
<p>flexible way;
</p>
<p>&ndash; the project&rsquo;s NPV is not so high (or not so low) as to make it profitable
</p>
<p>(unprofitable) in just about any circumstance.
</p>
<p>3.6 Real Option Valuation 55</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The first point is striking: The greater riskiness, the greater is the probability that
</p>
<p>during the project&rsquo;s lifetime new information becomes available on which the
</p>
<p>investor may react. Therefore, option values increase rather than decrease with
</p>
<p>volatility (using financial jargon again). While in the traditional view the value of
</p>
<p>an investment declines with risk, it increases with risk when its option value is
</p>
<p>considered.9
</p>
<p>These factors are illustrated for the case of a call option in Fig. 3.5. The
</p>
<p>horizontal axis depicts the possible future prices of the underlying (of the barrel
</p>
<p>of crude in the example) e.g. during 3 years hence; therefore, the price of the
</p>
<p>underlying is not known at decision time. Focus is first on the kinky dashed line of
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.5. This component of the payoff function of an option is called its intrinsic
</p>
<p>value. Below a certain price of crude oil (the strike price), it will not be attractive for
</p>
<p>the investor to e.g. construct a platform for drilling in the sea because the NPV of
</p>
<p>future revenues does not cover the investment outlay. The project is &lsquo;out of the
</p>
<p>money&rsquo;. However, as soon as the price of the underlying exceeds this strike price,
</p>
<p>the value of the project will increase proportionately. It will be &lsquo;in the money&rsquo;,
</p>
<p>causing the investor to exercise the option. Its intrinsic value increases in step with
</p>
<p>the price of the underlying, as indicated by the 45� slope of the payoff function.
The investor is assumed to hold expectations regarding the future price of the
</p>
<p>underlying. Let these expectations be reflected by a probability density function
</p>
<p>over the possible prices of the underlying (not depicted in Fig. 3.5), typically
</p>
<p>centered to the right of the strike price. Let this distribution first exhibit low
</p>
<p>uncertainty; it thus has little probability mass on both sides of the strike price.
</p>
<p>Due to the kink in the payoff function, the investor suffers no loss on the downside
</p>
<p>(by deferring construction) but does not stand to gain much either in case the option

<p>9The positive relation between risk and the economic value of a project might convince investors
</p>
<p>to enter into especially risky projects. In the academic literature, this effect is seen as one of the
</p>
<p>reasons for the emergence of the new economy bubble at the beginning of this century and the
</p>
<p>banking crisis of 2008.
</p>
<p>56 3 Investment and Profitability Calculation</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>is in the money. In a second scenario, let the future price of the underlying possibly
</p>
<p>diverge by a great amount from the strike price, reflecting higher riskiness. This
</p>
<p>time, the distribution function is characterized by much more spread because
</p>
<p>extreme values are possible now. However, this means that while the probability
</p>
<p>of the option being out of the money is higher, it also has more probability mass to
</p>
<p>the right of the strike price. Therefore, the investor, while still not suffering a loss on
</p>
<p>the downside, stands to gain greatly from the call option (i.e. the opportunity to
</p>
<p>invest in the platform). This shows that volatility is in the interest of investors,
</p>
<p>especially if they are in fact diversified shareholders of many companies who lose
</p>
<p>little if any one of these companies ends up in bankruptcy. Note that the value of
</p>
<p>their shares can never be less than zero.
</p>
<p>Turning to the second factor mentioned above, the intrinsic value of an option
</p>
<p>neglects the value of flexibility to the investor, who can either produce crude oil at a
</p>
<p>given price or decide against production depending on the market clearing price at
</p>
<p>any time of the option&rsquo;s lifetime. Again, consider two scenarios. In the first, let the
</p>
<p>probability density function reflecting beliefs be centered above the strike price,
</p>
<p>with limited spread. While this makes the investment somewhat attractive, very
</p>
<p>high values of the underlying are unlikely during the next 156 weeks (3 years) in the
</p>
<p>example given. Flexibility in the timing of the decision to invest is of little
</p>
<p>relevance in this case. Accordingly, the so-called time value of the option is close
</p>
<p>to zero, as reflected by the small vertical distance between the total payoff function
</p>
<p>and its dashed component (equal to the intrinsic value). Next, let the probability
</p>
<p>density function be centered below the strike price, again with little spread. This
</p>
<p>indicates that the investor is highly certain that the option will be out of the money
</p>
<p>for some time. Again, flexibility with respect to (not) exercising the option does not
</p>
<p>have much value. In sum, the time value of an option is small at the two extremes of
</p>
<p>the price line; conversely, it is highest when the probability distribution is centered
</p>
<p>at the strike price because it is there where the project has much probability of being
</p>
<p>in the money for a sufficient amount of time to make it economically viable. Being
</p>
<p>able to pick the time of deciding has great value in this case.
</p>
<p>Finally, the importance of the third factor cited above can be illustrated as
</p>
<p>follows. First, let the probability distribution be centered at a value far above the
</p>
<p>strike price, with limited spread. This means that there is little (possibly even zero)
</p>
<p>probability mass at and below the strike price; the project is in the money in
</p>
<p>(almost) all circumstances. In addition, the time value of the option is close to
</p>
<p>zero, indicating that flexibility in timing of the decision is of little importance.
</p>
<p>Traditional economic project evaluation yields a clear conclusion in favor of the
</p>
<p>project in this case. Second, let the probability distribution be centered at a value far
</p>
<p>below the strike price, again with limited spread. Therefore, there is little probabil-
</p>
<p>ity mass at and above the strike price; the project is almost certainly out of the
</p>
<p>money. In this situation too, the option property of an investment project hardly
</p>
<p>matters. Conversely, the option property does matter when it is not clear whether
</p>
<p>the project is economically attractive or not.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.6.2 Black-Scholes Model
</p>
<p>The choice of methods available for assessing a risky investment presented so far is
</p>
<p>still not complete. Indeed, it comprises the following alternatives.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Risk-adjusted interest rate: For the present value (PV) calculation of future cash
</p>
<p>flows, a risk-adjusted discount rate i is used. Since &part;PV/&part;i&lt; 0, a project is more
likely to be rejected when the discount rate is high (see Eq. (3.4)).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Sensitivity analysis: A project&rsquo;s net present value (NPV) calculation is repeated,
</p>
<p>using different combinations of parameters (investment outlay, revenue and cost
</p>
<p>streams, useful life of the project, and values of i). In this way, one can identify
</p>
<p>the critical scenarios in which its NPV becomes negative.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Monte Carlo simulation: First, the stochastic properties of the factors influencing
</p>
<p>the NPV of the project are analyzed, such as the distributions of and covariances
</p>
<p>between possible future prices, sales volumes, and costs. In each round of simulation,
</p>
<p>values of these parameters are drawn at random and theNPV calculated, resulting in
</p>
<p>a distribution ofNPV values. Depending on the investor&rsquo;s risk preference, the project
</p>
<p>is accepted if the NPV is positive in more than e.g. 95% of simulations.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Decision tree analysis: First, all possible outcomes of the project and the sequence
</p>
<p>of events leading to them need to be defined. Some so-called nodes of the tree are
</p>
<p>controlled by the investor (management, respectively), while some are controlled
</p>
<p>by Nature as it were. Next, the branches of these latter nodes are associated with
</p>
<p>their respective probabilities, permitting management to choose the action
</p>
<p>associated with the highest expected payoff at the nodes under its control. Also
</p>
<p>known as dynamic programming, this method yields optimal decision paths.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Valuation of the project as a call option: The great insight of Black and Scholes
</p>
<p>(1973) was that a risk-free portfolio can be constructed by combining options.
</p>
<p>To see this, consider a so-called European option that can only be exercised at
</p>
<p>maturity, i.e. at the end of the contract period. Therefore, this type of option does
</p>
<p>not offer flexibility and thus can be depicted by the kinky dashed line of Fig. 3.5.
</p>
<p>If this line is matched with another one that slopes down to the right of the strike
</p>
<p>price, the resulting payoff function runs horizontal, indicating that such a
</p>
<p>portfolio is risk-free since it yields a payoff that is independent of possible
</p>
<p>future prices of the underlying. To achieve this, the investor would have to
</p>
<p>write a call option entailing the obligation to deliver the underlying in case the
</p>
<p>purchaser of the option exercises it, i.e. when the price of the underlying exceeds
</p>
<p>the strike price (recall that this would generate an option premium, which is
</p>
<p>abstracted from in Fig. 3.5). Alternatively, the investor could buy shares issued
</p>
<p>by a generating company with a similar project amounting to the value of the
</p>
<p>investment to hedge it, selling a call option as well as buying a put option on
</p>
<p>them. In this way, he or she incurs a loss on the call option if the project is &lsquo;in the
</p>
<p>money&rsquo;, which is offset by the value of the project in this case. In case the project
</p>
<p>does not perform and is &lsquo;out of the money&rsquo;, so is the call option on the shares;
</p>
<p>however, the put option has value in this case. Evidently, options on shares can
</p>
<p>also be used to form a risk-free portfolio (justifying the put-call parity mentioned
</p>
<p>58 3 Investment and Profitability Calculation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>below). However, a risk-free portfolio can be discounted applying a risk-free
</p>
<p>interest rate, which simplifies the valuation problem decisively.
</p>
<p>The basic assumption of Black and Scholes is that the market price p of the
</p>
<p>underlying follows a so-called standardizedWiener process with drift μ and volatility
</p>

</p>
<p>3.6 Real Option Valuation 59</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The put-call parity follows from the fact that options can be combined in a way
</p>
<p>as to result in a risk-free asset; note the crucial role of discounting the exercise price
</p>
<p>eT to present value using the risk-free rate of interest i in Eq. (3.33). Evidently, the
</p>
<p>parameters of the Black-Scholes model, which refer to financial options, need to be
</p>
<p>translated into terms referring to investment projects. The corresponding
</p>
<p>equivalencies are shown in Table 3.2, along with the influence of the parameter
</p>
<p>on the option value. In particular, the exercise price becomes the investment outlay;
</p>
<p>the higher its value, the more the kink in the payoff function of Fig. 3.5 shifts to the
</p>
<p>right, indicating a reduction of probability mass over positive payoffs and hence a
</p>
<p>reduction in the value of the call option. Also, a high risk-free interest rate means
</p>
<p>that the purchaser of the option can reap substantial benefits from an investment in a
</p>
<p>risk-free asset up to maturity, which lowers the present value of payment for the
</p>
<p>option and therefore increases its value. This effect is the more important, the
</p>
<p>farther maturity T lies in the future (see Eq. 3.30). Finally note the crucial impor-
</p>
<p>tance of the normality assumption of the Wiener process; N(d1) and N(d1) symbol-
</p>
<p>ize the probability of the price of the asset attaining a certain value (T-t) periods in
</p>
<p>future. However, returns of investment projects typically are characterized by an
</p>
<p>asymmetric distribution, with substantial probability mass to the left of the
</p>
<p>expected value (positive skewness). While a log-normal random variable does
</p>
<p>exhibit positive skewness, returns to investment have been found to have &lsquo;flat
</p>
<p>tails&rsquo;, i.e. a higher probability of extreme values occurring than indicated by log
</p>
<p>normality. Therefore, the Black-Scholes formula may lead investors to underesti-
</p>
<p>mate the riskiness of a project.
</p>
<p>3.6.3 Application to Balancing Power Supply
</p>
<p>Often, the dispatch of a power plant is flexible in so far as the rate of production per
</p>
<p>time unit (usually, a quarter of an hour) can be increased or decreased. This gives
</p>
<p>the plant operator the possibility to balance deviations from day-ahead schedules by
</p>
<p>increasing or decreasing production output, and thus save on purchases of balancing

<p>power from the grid operator (see also Sect. 13.1.3). Therefore, investment in a
</p>
<p>flexible power plant can be considered as the purchase of a real option which can be
</p>
<p>exercised to minimize cost caused by deviations from the schedules.
</p>
<p>The underlying of the option is the avoided cost associated with the purchase of
</p>
<p>balancing power from the grid operator. Let this cost be log-normally distributed
</p>
<p>with a mean of 0.9 EUR ct/kWh and an annualized volatility of 40.5%, which
</p>
<p>determines the values of d1 and d2 as well as their associated probabilities given a
</p>
<p>log-normal distribution. For an estimated annual operating time of 5500 h/year, the
</p>
<p>expected annual contribution margin adds up to 5500 � 0.009 &frac14; 50 EUR/kW
installed capacity. The calculation is carried out on the basis of a time to maturity
</p>
<p>of 10 years.
</p>
<p>Table 3.3 shows the input values, the interim values, and the results of the Black-
</p>
<p>Scholes model for this example. Given the assumptions, the call option value of the
</p>
<p>capacity is 23 EUR/kW/year. Capitalizing this value yields the additional value the
</p>
<p>plant operator should be willing to pay for the possibility to avoid the purchase of
</p>
<p>balancing power.
</p>
<p>Additional insights can be obtained by calculating the partial derivatives of the
</p>
<p>Black-Scholes formula with respect to the input variables. These derivatives quan-
</p>
<p>tify the sensitivity of the option value in response to marginal changes in these
</p>
<p>variables.

<p>Bottom-Up Analysis of Energy Demand 4
</p>
<p>Traditionally, energy economics has dealt with energy supply rather than demand.
</p>
<p>In contrast, this book gives demand precedence over supply, in keeping with the
</p>
<p>rule that without a minimum demand, supply does not come forth. Energy demand
</p>
<p>is often discussed in relation to the question of how to achieve &lsquo;energy savings&rsquo;, a
</p>
<p>term devoid of meaning without some prior knowledge of the factors affecting
</p>
<p>energy demand. These factors importantly derive from the profit-seeking actions of
</p>
<p>business managers and utility-oriented actions of consumers.
</p>
<p>Over the years, two fundamentally different analytical approaches to the demand
</p>
<p>for energy have emerged: macroeconomic modeling (often called the top-down
</p>
<p>approach) and microeconomic process analysis (the bottom-up approach). The
</p>
<p>latter, to be expounded below, is based on the premise that energy demand is
</p>
<p>determined by the existing stock of energy-using capital, the intensity of its use,
</p>
<p>and its energy efficiency.
</p>
<p>This approach gives rise to a series of questions:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Why is it important to distinguish between energy-using capital and the intensity
</p>
<p>of its use for analyzing energy demand?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the factors determining the acquisition of a particular energy-using
</p>
<p>capital good?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the factors determining the intensity of their use?
</p>
<p>In addition, the issue of energy efficiency needs to be addressed:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Why is energy &lsquo;wasted&rsquo; if it is a costly factor of production?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How can efficiency be improved?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Is there market failure in the case of investment in energy efficiency?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How can innovation boost energy efficiency?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How is energy efficiency defined to begin with?
</p>

<p>4.1 Process Analysis
</p>
<p>In process analysis, aggregate energy demand is split up into energy sources on the
</p>
<p>one hand (electricity, heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, diesel, hydrogen, etc.), and
</p>
<p>types of energy consumers (branches of industry, households, small businesses, and
</p>
<p>the transport sector) on the other. Demand is further differentiated by types of use
</p>
<p>(low-temperature heat, high-temperature heat, work, lighting, and electrolysis).
</p>
<p>The demand for each type of energy per unit of time depends on three factors:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Energy-using capital stock (appliances, buildings, machinery, vehicles);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Intensity of use of this capital stock (e.g. km driven per month);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Energy efficiency (e.g. liters of gasoline per 100 km driven; miles per gallon,
</p>
<p>respectively in the United States).
</p>
<p>Figure 4.1 exhibits the process-analytical model. Demand for energy E(t) of a
</p>
<p>particular type in time period t is a function of the stock of energy-using capital Cap
</p>
<p>(t) and the intensity ν(t) of its use at a given level of energy efficiency (which is not
</p>
<p>yet analyzed at this point in the interest of simplicity). Desired stock Cap*(t)
</p>
<p>generally deviates from the given stock Cap(t�1). The gap between Cap*(t) and
Cap(t�1) is not immediately closed but at a rate α, 0 &lt; α &lt; 1. Partial adjustment
makes economic sense for several reasons. Investors need to find out whether the
</p>
<p>changes in factors influencing Cap*(t) are really long-term or just transitory, they
</p>
<p>66 4 Bottom-Up Analysis of Energy Demand</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>may face financial constraints due to imperfect capital markets, and they may have
</p>
<p>to deal with delays in the construction and deliveries. Net investment ΔCap(t) is
</p>
<p>therefore given by
</p>
<p>ΔCap t&eth; &THORN; &frac14; α Cap* t&eth; &THORN; � Cap t� 1&eth; &THORN;
� �
</p>
<p>, 0 &lt; α &lt; 1: &eth;4:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>Note that α need not to be constant. Rather, it is a decision variable whose value
</p>
<p>depends on the cost-benefit ratio of fast adjustment in comparison to the cost-
</p>
<p>benefit ratio of slow adjustment. For instance, when the user cost of capital is
</p>
<p>expected to rise (say due to a surge in interest rates), the opportunity cost of slow
</p>
<p>adjustment becomes high, causing α ! 1.
In addition to the user cost of capital, investment entails costs of procurement.
</p>
<p>While these costs do not necessarily affect desired capital stock Cap*(t), they do
</p>
<p>affect energy efficiency and hence the demand for energy. Due to technological
</p>
<p>innovation, the conversion of final energy into useful energy usually becomes more
</p>
<p>efficient with the procurement of new energy-using capital stock.1
</p>
<p>The demand for energy also depends on the age structure of the energy-using
</p>
<p>capital stock. In the Vintage Capital Growth model, Cap(t) consists of vintages
</p>
<p>Capi(t), with i&frac14; 1,. . . symbolizing additions to capital (&lsquo;layers&rsquo; as it were) in a past
period i. In this way, Capi-1(t�1) is carried forward to Capi(t):

</p>
<p>shortened useful life implies an increase in these costs, which can only be balanced by marked

<p>increases in the energy efficiency of new vintages.

<p>The variable δi-1 denotes the rate of depreciation pertaining to a particular

<p>vintage i. Since current capital stock is the sum over vintages of many periods,
</p>
<p>improvements in energy efficiency affect only a small part of its total, causing
</p>
<p>adjustments to exogenous shocks such as a hike in the price of energy to be
</p>
<p>sluggish.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 4.1, two sets of factors affecting the demand for energy are distinguished.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Long-term factors: These affect the stock of energy-using capital as well as
</p>
<p>improvements in energy efficiency. Capital stock is adjusted in response to
</p>
<p>demographic and sociological variables, such as household size and composi-
</p>
<p>tion, commuting distances, and lifestyle. Investment in energy efficiency is
</p>
<p>driven by technological change, government policy (e.g. the setting of efficiency
</p>
<p>standards for vehicles and appliances), and deliberate choices by pioneering
</p>
<p>companies and households. However, the most important determinants of both
</p>
<p>energy-using capital stock and efficiency belong to the economic sphere. These
</p>
<p>are business sales, disposable income and wealth, the rate of interest as a
</p>
<p>component of capital user cost, and the price of energy relative to other goods
</p>
<p>and services (e.g. public transportation), along with expectations concerning
</p>
<p>their future development.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Short-term factors: These affect the intensity with which the stock of capital is
</p>
<p>used. These factors not only include fluctuations in temperature, the business
</p>
<p>cycle, and calendar effects, but also fluctuations in income and energy prices that
</p>
<p>are not expected to be permanent.
</p>
<p>4.2 Stock of Appliances, Buildings, Vehicles, and Machineries
</p>
<p>For modeling the demand for energy applying process analysis, it is useful to
</p>
<p>distinguish final users of energy (households, commercial businesses, industry,
</p>
<p>transport) and to match them with uses of energy (heat, work, lighting) on the
</p>
<p>one hand and components of capital stock (appliances, buildings, machinery, and
</p>
<p>vehicles) on the other. The variables listed in Table 4.1 have proved to be statisti-
</p>
<p>cally significant in surveys and econometric studies of energy demand.
</p>
<p>Taking household demand for electricity as an example, it is obvious that stocks
</p>
<p>of electricity-consuming household appliances (such as ovens, washing machines,
</p>
<p>refrigerators, and dishwashers) must be among the determinants. These stocks are
</p>
<p>in turn the product of the number of households and the probability of these
</p>
<p>households owning the appliances cited. While the number of households and
</p>
<p>their composition are usually viewed as demographic variables, ownership
</p>
<p>68 4 Bottom-Up Analysis of Energy Demand</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>probabilities are susceptible to economic influences. Ownership probability is
</p>
<p>defined as a dichotomous stochastic variable Xn,
</p>
<p>Xn &frac14; 1 (household n owns the appliance or vehicle in question);
Xn &frac14; 0 (household n does not own the appliance ore vehicle).
</p>
<p>Economic theory predicts that decision-makers purchase an appliance or vehicle
</p>
<p>when its net utility exceeds that of all other alternatives under consideration. While
</p>
<p>subjective, individual utility depends on several objectively measurable factors
</p>
<p>(often called &lsquo;drivers&rsquo;) Dj. In the case of a household, they include the comfort
</p>
<p>and time-saving afforded by the appliance or vehicle, household size, and compo-
</p>
<p>sition (in particular double-income status), disposable income, and type and loca-
</p>
<p>tion of residence. On the negative side, one has the total cost of ownership C (which

<p>determinant Dj for decision-maker n (note that this importance is assumed to be
</p>
<p>identical across decision-makers). However, in any practical application the com-
</p>
<p>plete set of determinants is never observed. There are unmeasured influences on
</p>
<p>utility which are represented by a stochastic term εn. Individual utility Un derived

</p>
<p>Evidently, utility is split into a systematic, deterministic component Vn and an
</p>
<p>unsystematic, stochastic component εn. This approach is known as the Random
</p>
<p>Utility Model (McFadden 1974). It predicts that the probability w of owning an
</p>
<p>appliance or a vehicle increases with the net utility afforded by it.
</p>
<p>A probability is bounded by the [0, 1] interval. Therefore, estimating a linear
</p>
<p>regression of the observed values (Xn&frac14; 1: household owns the appliance or vehicle,
Xn &frac14; 0: does not own it) on the determinants of utility leads to the problem of
rendering predicted values outside this interval. A regression function with a
</p>
<p>codomain in the [0, 1] interval is called for. Sigmoid functions of the type shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 4.2 meet this condition and are often employed in this context. The main
</p>
<p>choices are the standard logistic function used in the Logistic (also called Logit)
</p>
<p>regression model and the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal
</p>
<p>distribution used in the Probit regression model.

<p>In the case of the Logistic regression (this choice is justified below), the

<p>Provided the stochastic component εn follows the logistic distribution, this
</p>
<p>results in consistent, efficient, and asymptomatically normally-distributed estimates

<p>of the parameters βj.
2
</p>
<p>For an assessment of the econometric evidence and public policy, one would like
</p>
<p>to know the importance of a particular influence Dj. This is usually measured as the
</p>
<p>marginal impact of Dj on ownership probability w (the household index n is omitted
</p>
<p>for simplicity). Partial differentiation of Eqs. (4.4) and (4.8) yields

</p>
<p>Clearly, the marginal effect of a determinant on the probability of ownership
</p>
<p>w depends on the initial value of w. This effect is most pronounced at w &frac14; 0.5 since
w (1&ndash;w) attains its maximum at w &frac14; 0.5. On the other hand, the predicted effect of
Dj goes to zero when w ! 0 or w ! 1. A remaining problem is the fact that a
determinant can be measured in different ways. For instance, disposable income
</p>
<p>can be expressed in thousands of EUR rather than EUR, and per month or per year.
</p>
<p>The solution is to denote the change in the parameter Dj in relative terms, resulting
</p>
<p>in a so-called semi-elasticity,
</p>
<p>2Consistency means that the estimated β values approach the true parameters with increasing
</p>
<p>sample size; efficiency means that the variance of the estimates is minimal.

<p>The induced change in w is still expressed in percentage points rather than a
</p>
<p>percentage. If one prefers to relate percentage changes in w to percentage changes
</p>
<p>in Dj, one can calculate a conventional elasticity by dividing Eq. (4.10) by w.
</p>

</p>
<p>While the Probit model has the advantage of reflecting the normality assumption
</p>
<p>(which in turn is based on the Central Limit Theorem), the Logit model permits a
</p>
<p>much simpler interpretation of the market share of an appliance (or vehicle).
</p>
<p>Consider two competing heating systems, assuming that they are identical except
</p>
<p>for their expected operating costs c1 and c2, respectively. According to economic
</p>
<p>theory, their market shares sh1 and sh2 should be inversely related to their relative
</p>
<p>cost c1/c2, however without suggesting that one of the two systems will be driven
</p>
<p>from the market when its operating cost is but marginally higher than that of its
</p>
<p>competitor. A functional relationship with these properties is

</p>
<p>In the unlikely case of parity in terms of cost (c1 &frac14; c2), Eq. (4.12) implies a
market share of 50% for each. Since market shares reflect aggregate ownership
</p>
<p>probabilities, ln(sh1/(1&ndash;sh1)) is analogous to ln(w2/w1) &frac14; ln(w1/(1&ndash;w1)) in Eq. (4.7)
and thus to the Logit model. The parameter g indicates the extent to which small
</p>
<p>cost differentials between competing heating systems affect their market shares. It

<p>therefore shows the ease with which they can be substituted for each other. In the
</p>
<p>extreme case of g !1, a small cost advantage is predicted to drive the market
share of the cheaper system toward 100% (note that this is the optimal solution of a
</p>
<p>linear programming model, which is non-stochastic but fully deterministic).
</p>
<p>The binary Logit model can be refined in numerous ways. In particular, it can be
</p>
<p>generalized to K choice alternatives (McFadden 1974). In Eq. (4.13) below, wk(n)
</p>
<p>symbolizes the probability of household n favoring alternative k over all others.
</p>
<p>Omitting the household index n again, the so-called multinomial Logit model reads

</p>
<p>Due to the fact that only differences between utilities play a role in this model,
</p>
<p>the parameters β0,k, β1,k, β2,k,... are not identified unless they are fixed in some
</p>
<p>category. Usually, one chooses the first alternative (k &frac14; 1) as the benchmark
category by setting β0,1 &frac14; β1,1 &frac14; β2,1 &frac14; . . . &frac14; 0.3
</p>
<p>The multinomial logit model is based on the assumption that the available
</p>
<p>alternatives are independent of one another (the so-called independence of irrele-
</p>
<p>vant alternatives or IIA assumption). This assumption often does not hold. For
</p>
<p>example, the IIA assumption in Fig. 4.3 would require the probability of owning a
</p>
<p>second car to be independent of whether or not there is already a car in the
</p>
<p>household. In reality, the alternatives &lsquo;no car&rsquo;, &lsquo;one car&rsquo;, and &lsquo;two cars&rsquo; usually
</p>
<p>depend on each other.
</p>
<p>The nested logit model permits to take dependencies of this type into account
</p>
<p>(see Greene 2011). For example, let the probability of owning two cars be related to
</p>
<p>the probability of already having one. This means that first the probability of
</p>
<p>owning one care needs to be determined. Then, the probability of purchasing a
</p>
<p>second one given this initial probability can be analyzed. This results in the
</p>
<p>following two equations,

</p>
<p>A logit model for car ownership was estimated by Brendemoen (1994), based on
</p>
<p>1547 Norwegian households observed in the year 1985. While a bit dated, this
</p>
<p>sample is of interest because 23% of the households did not own a car at the time,
</p>
<p>justifying analysis of single-car ownership (which had a share of 60%). However,
</p>
<p>15% of households owned two cars and 2%, three or more cars. Rather than
</p>
<p>applying the nested logit model in the guise of Fig. 4.3, the author directly estimates
</p>
<p>the probability of owning e.g. two cars (and not of none, one, and three or
</p>
<p>more cars).
</p>
<p>3Provided the stochastic variable εk follows an extreme value distribution (also referred to as the
</p>
<p>Weibull or Gumbel distribution), the remaining β&rsquo;s can be estimated in a consistent way.

<p>In addition, there are two extensions to the usual choice model as presented in
</p>
<p>Eq. (4.4). First, the utility function Vn(�) contains a term for the availability of one or
more cars. Second, there is an explicit budget constraint stating that the sum of
</p>
<p>consumption expenditures of the household, including on operating j cars, is equal
</p>
<p>to the net income after deduction of the fixed cost of ownership jc, where c is the
</p>
<p>cost per car (whose average value in 1985 is known). Note that the impact of prices
</p>
<p>cannot be identified because they are approximately the same for all households
</p>
<p>across Norway. The utility function associated with having one rather than no car
</p>
<p>estimated in the author&rsquo;s preferred model C has the form (t ratios in parentheses),
</p>
<p>Vn &frac14; 3:58&eth;7:40&THORN;

</p>
<p>&eth;4:15&THORN;
</p>
<p>with a pseudo-R2 &frac14; 0.44 (this is the relative increase in the log likelihood).
While the number of adults in the household is not statistically significant, the
</p>
<p>number of children is, indicating an increased demand for transportation.
</p>
<p>Households with an older head, living in one of the country&rsquo;s major cities, and
</p>
<p>having access to business cars derive less utility from owning a car and are therefore
</p>
<p>less likely to own one. Conversely, probability of ownership increases with the
</p>
<p>number of employed persons in the household; it also increases with income (after
</p>
<p>deduction of the fixed cost of owning one car). The pertinent coefficient of 15.35
</p>
<p>looks out of line; however, since net income is measured in logs, the partial
</p>
<p>derivative is &part;Vn/&part;Dj &frac14; (&part;Vn/&part;Dj)(&part; Dj/&part;lnDj) rather than &part;Vn/&part;Dj as indicated
in Eq. (4.4). The estimated partial relationship thus amounts to (&part;Vn/&part;Dj)�Dj.
Therefore, the coefficient of 15.35 in Eq. (4.15) equals βj�Dj, implying βj&frac14; 0.109
(&frac14; 15.35/141) since average income is Dj &frac14; 141 (measured in thousands of NOK).
This value is comparable to the other ones shown in Eq. (4.15).
</p>
<p>Of course, the estimated income elasticity is of crucial interest because incomes
</p>
<p>in Norway were expected to rise (and indeed did since). Brendemoen (1994)
</p>
<p>calculates the income elasticity of the probability of having one car (rather than
</p>
<p>none, two, three or more) as 0.12. This value results from deducting the income
</p>
<p>No car One car
</p>
<p>One car Two cars

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>elasticities associated with having a number of cars unequal to one and therefore
</p>
<p>cannot be calculated from Eq. (4.15) using Eq. (4.10).
</p>
<p>In addition, income elasticities depend on the level of income (see Table 4.2).
</p>
<p>Among households in the lowest quartile of the sample, a 10% increase in income is
</p>
<p>estimated to raise the probability of owning one car by 10.4%, that of owning two
</p>
<p>cars, by 33.4% (albeit from a very low initial value). In the top income quartile, the
</p>
<p>same relative increase in income would primarily reduce the probabilities of
</p>
<p>owning no car or just one car. Households in that quartile would respond by owning
</p>
<p>two and three cars, with ownership probabilities increasing by 3.9% and 8.0%,
</p>
<p>respectively. Of course, with car ownership close to 100% by now, analyzing the
</p>
<p>demand for cars with certain characteristics (e.g. categorized by fuel consumption)
</p>
<p>would be more important than just predicting car ownership per se.
</p>
<p>An application of the multinomial logit model by Henkel (2013) goes in this
</p>
<p>direction. It seeks to identify the determinants of the market development of eight
</p>
<p>different heating systems: natural gas (baseline), fuel oil, wood pellets, heat pump,
</p>
<p>fuel oil &amp; solar, natural gas &amp; solar, wood pellets &amp; solar, and heat pump &amp; solar.
</p>
<p>The quantitative analysis is based on a survey carried out in 2009&ndash;2010 involving
</p>
<p>German households who recently had installed a new heating system; the survey
</p>
<p>also asked the reasons for their choice. In the Logit model, the independent
</p>
<p>variables are classified into decider-specific and alternative-specific ones.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The alternative-specific variables are the net present value of the life-cycle cost
</p>
<p>of the alternatives (calculated by using an interest rate of 4.3%) and the annuity
</p>
<p>of the investment costs divided by the monthly household income (indicating the
</p>
<p>financing capacity of the household).
</p>
<p>&ndash; The decider-specific variables are
</p>
<p>&ndash; Eco-friendly: environmental friendliness of the heating system is important;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Space: required space for heating system is important;
</p>
<p>&ndash; SmallVillage: place of residence has fewer than 5000 inhabitants;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Maintenance: maintenance of the heating system is important;
</p>
<p>&ndash; PanelHeating: existence of a panel heating system.
</p>
<p>Decider-specific variables are equal for all heating systems while alternative-
</p>
<p>specific variables vary across heating systems. Given eight alternatives, every
</p>
<p>alternative-specific variable adds one parameter to be estimated to the model.

<p>With every decider-specific variable, which relates to one of the eight systems,
</p>
<p>another seven are added (eight minus one for the base alternative).
</p>
<p>The model as a whole and the majority of estimated parameters are statistically
</p>
<p>significant at the 1% level. The R2 (McFadden) is 0.321, which represents an
</p>
<p>acceptable model fit. According to the Hausmann test (see Hensher et al. 2005),
</p>
<p>the IIA assumption cannot be rejected for seven of eight alternatives (except for
</p>
<p>&lsquo;natural gas &amp; solar&rsquo;). The marginal effects of the decider-specific variables are
</p>
<p>shown in Table 4.3. As all decider-specific variables are binary dummy variables,
</p>
<p>the marginal effect is the gain (or loss) in choice probability if households assume
</p>
<p>the variable to be important (unimportant, respectively). The rows in Table 4.3 sum
</p>
<p>up to zero: If the choice probability for one alternative increases, it must decrease
</p>
<p>for the others.
</p>
<p>The interpretation of the marginal effects is as follows. If environmental friend-
</p>
<p>liness Eco-friendly is regarded to be important, decision-makers have a lower
</p>
<p>probability of choosing conventional heating systems (by �4.9% in the case of
natural gas, �3.8% in the case of fuel oil) but are more likely to choose a &lsquo;natural
gas &amp; solar&rsquo; system. Living in a village with fewer than 5000 inhabitants reduces
</p>
<p>the probability of choosing a natural gas heating system by �16.4% while increas-
ing that of adopting a fuel oil-based one (the benchmark category) by 15.4%. If a
</p>
<p>decision-maker considersMaintenance to be important, this reduces the probability
</p>
<p>of opting for a heat pump and wood pellets but increases the probability of choosing
</p>
<p>one of the conventional heating systems. Decision-makers who own a house with a
</p>
<p>panel heating system (PanelHeating) are less likely to prefer a conventional heating
</p>
<p>system but more likely to select one of the (unconventional) alternatives, in
</p>
<p>particular a heat pump. While all these findings are plausible, the results for the
</p>
<p>variable Space are surprising: If the space requirement of a heating system is
</p>
<p>considered to be important, the probability of buying one based on natural gas
</p>
<p>decreases (one would expect the opposite), mainly in favor of combined natural gas
</p>
<p>&amp; solar. Violation of the IIA assumption for this alternative may be responsible for
</p>
<p>this implausible result.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.3 Energy Efficiency
</p>
<p>4.3.1 Definitions
</p>
<p>In economic theory, the following hierarchy of terminology is employed. The
</p>
<p>highest-ranking criterion is (Pareto) optimality; it is achieved when demand
</p>
<p>preferences are served in the best possible way given the best use of productive
</p>
<p>resources available. Optimality requires the slopes of the representative consumer&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>indifference curve and the economy&rsquo;s transformation curve to be equal (in technical
</p>
<p>terms, the marginal rate of substitution in preference equals the marginal rate of
</p>
<p>transformation in production). Efficiency is next; it is achieved when the factors of
</p>
<p>production are employed in such a way that a point on the transformation curve is
</p>
<p>reached and the ratio of marginal productivities equals the ratio of factor prices.
</p>
<p>Productivity comes last; it is a one-dimensional concept meaning that the input of
</p>
<p>one factor of production (an energy source in the present context) generates the
</p>
<p>maximum possible output.
</p>
<p>In energy economics, however, a different terminology prevails. Here, energy
</p>
<p>efficiency is understood as the productivity of the single input &lsquo;energy&rsquo;. This entails
</p>
<p>the risk of losing sight of the fact that energy is not the only factor of production. A
</p>
<p>reduced use of energy comes at the price of increased inputs of capital in particular
</p>
<p>(e.g. for insulating buildings) and land (e.g. for solar panels or growing crops for
</p>
<p>use in energy generation). Energy could in principle be substituted by labor, too; yet
</p>
<p>in today&rsquo;s developed economies, the proposal to do away with gas-guzzling
</p>
<p>caterpillars in favor of ditch-diggers in construction would likely be met with
</p>
<p>resistance. One could argue that improvements in energy efficiency (as defined
</p>
<p>above) permit to reduce energy consumption without an increase in other inputs.
</p>
<p>Yet on closer inspection, it becomes evident that these improvements require an
</p>
<p>investment of physical as well as human capital (in the guise of skilled labor).
</p>
<p>There exist a variety of approaches for the measurement of energy efficiency.
</p>
<p>The thermodynamic efficiency factor
</p>
<p>ω &frac14; useful energy output
energy input
</p>
<p>&eth;4:16&THORN;
</p>
<p>is often employed, with both numerator and denominator expressed in units of
</p>
<p>energy (lower heating value).
</p>
<p>However, this definition neglects the energetic quality of input and output. This
</p>
<p>is taken into account by the exergetic efficiency factor, which is based on the second
</p>
<p>Law of thermodynamics,
</p>
<p>ω &frac14; useful energy output
exergy input
</p>
<p>: &eth;4:17&THORN;
</p>
<p>4.3 Energy Efficiency 77</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Exergy is defined as the quantity of energy that can be converted to work (rather
</p>
<p>than heat, which is viewed as being of inferior quality because it cannot be
</p>
<p>transformed into work without considerable losses, if at all).
</p>
<p>When output variables other than energy or exergy are used, energy efficiency
</p>
<p>approaches the concept of productivity in the economic sense. Some of the
</p>
<p>corresponding indicators are
</p>
<p>heated living space
</p>
<p>energy input
,
</p>
<p>passenger-kilometers
</p>
<p>energy input
,
</p>
<p>steel production
</p>
<p>energy input
:
</p>
<p>Their inverses indicate the energy input required for producing a given quantity
</p>
<p>of energy services. As stated above, these indicators neglect the fact that a reduction
</p>
<p>of energy inputs (holding production constant) can ultimately be achieved only by
</p>
<p>the increased input of other factors of production. For example, a ton of steel can be
</p>
<p>produced with less energy if blast furnaces are better insulated. This however
</p>
<p>means an increase in the use of insulation materials, and therefore of capital in
</p>
<p>the form of building investment. If the reduction of energy inputs results from
</p>
<p>technological advances, an increase in expertise or of human capital (achieved
</p>
<p>through education of the workforce) is required.
</p>
<p>Generally, provision of goods and services requires the input of factors of
</p>
<p>production whose scarcity is expressed by their price (neglecting external effects
</p>
<p>at this point). Energy is one such scarce factor of production, whose money value
</p>
<p>can be compared with the money value of outputs produced. Examples of such
</p>
<p>efficiency indicators are
</p>
<p>rental payments received
</p>
<p>energy input of the building
,
</p>
<p>value added
</p>
<p>energy input
:
</p>
<p>The first of the two is still a one-dimensional concept, whereas the second can be
</p>
<p>said to measure efficiency in the economic sense because value added comprises the
</p>
<p>whole set of goods and services produced by an economy. Its inverse is often called
</p>
<p>&lsquo;energy intensity of a country&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product GDP&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The efficiency indicators cited not only serve to describe and forecast energy
</p>
<p>demand but also assume the status of norms because the supply and consumption of
</p>
<p>energy is intricately tied to problems of sustainability and environmental degrada-
</p>
<p>tion. From a normative perspective, energy efficiency means conversion of energy
</p>
<p>with the lowest possible losses. This view is beyond dispute in the public debate,
</p>
<p>but only as long as the cost of preventing these losses is neglected. Energy
</p>
<p>efficiency is enhanced by better resource management or by replacing devices
</p>
<p>with unfavorable energy ratings. Both cases imply substitution processes: Better
</p>
<p>resource management calls for the substitution of energy by human capital and
</p>
<p>know-how, while the upgrading of devices entails the substitution of energy by
</p>
<p>capital.
</p>
<p>These processes are often associated with the term &lsquo;energy savings&rsquo;. However,
</p>
<p>energy savings differ from efficiency improvements in the following ways:
</p>
<p>78 4 Bottom-Up Analysis of Energy Demand</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ndash; Energy savings can be forced upon consumers to the extent that they are caused
</p>
<p>by technical failures or supply shocks resulting from political, social, and
</p>
<p>military tensions and conflicts. In an attempt to ensure a fair distribution of
</p>
<p>energy, governments often resort to rationing, e.g. by using fuel cards and
</p>
<p>rotating brownouts and blackouts in the case of electricity or natural gas. None
</p>
<p>of these measures affect energy efficiency.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Energy savings may be consumers&rsquo; response to a price hike, causing them to
</p>
<p>curtail their demand for energy, as well as for energy services and energy-
</p>
<p>intensive products. For example, let heating oil become more expensive relative
</p>
<p>to other goods. The expected response is a lowering of room temperature during
</p>
<p>the heating season, resulting in a decline in energy consumption.4 Other substi-
</p>
<p>tution strategies include moving to a smaller residence, replacing a mid-sized
</p>
<p>passenger car by a compact one, and switching to public transport for commut-
</p>
<p>ing. These strategies are remotely related to energy efficiency in that e.g. at
</p>
<p>smaller residence may also require less heating oil per square meter of floor
</p>
<p>space.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Energy savings are often hoped for as a consequence of &lsquo;changed values&rsquo; or
</p>
<p>&lsquo;change in lifestyle&rsquo;, i.e. a change in consumer preferences. Some experts even
</p>
<p>make normative statements, urging households and businesses to adopt new
</p>
<p>standards of behavior in consideration of global warming and the exhaustion of
</p>
<p>fossil fuel resources. In fact, most consumers in advanced economies would
</p>
<p>suffer little loss in terms of their quality of life if they were to marginally reduce
</p>
<p>their consumption of energy. Yet, changes in lifestyle have not occurred on a
</p>
<p>noticeable scale to this day, supporting the economic view that preferences are
</p>
<p>not easily modified.
</p>
<p>Engineers are able to point out a multitude of opportunities for increasing energy
</p>
<p>efficiency. However, decision-making in the economic sphere revolves around the
</p>
<p>provision of energy services at minimum cost. There is an interest in enhancing
</p>
<p>energy efficiency only to the extent that the corresponding investment pays off. The
</p>
<p>relevant parameters are the associated (extra) investment outlay ΔI, the attainable
</p>
<p>reduction in energy consumption energy ΔE [kWh/a], the expected price of energy
</p>
<p>pE [EUR/kWh], and the present value factor PVFi,T (see Sect. 3.2) which depends
</p>
<p>on the investor&rsquo;s planning horizon T. When comparing alternatives for producing a
</p>
<p>given quantity of energy service, the investor will select the one promising the
</p>
<p>highest rate of return, given by the annuity AN,
</p>
<p>AN &frac14; �ΔI

leads to an energy saving of 4%.

<p>which needs to be positive to begin with. The first term is the investment outlay
</p>
<p>distributed over the T years of the project, taking into account the rate of interest
</p>
<p>i that could be earned on the capital market. The second term shows the return in
</p>
<p>terms of avoided expenditure on energy.

<p>Thus, the so-called (marginal) cost of conserved energy (CCE) must not exceed
</p>
<p>the unit price of the energy whose consumption can be reduced. Note that the
</p>
<p>maximum-return solution is equivalent to a least-cost solution (calling for mini-
</p>
<p>mum capital user cost which is again an annuity).
</p>
<p>However, minimum-cost planning often clashes with the attainment of maxi-
</p>
<p>mum energy efficiency, the engineer&rsquo;s preferred solution. This is illustrated by
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.4, taking the insulation of a building as an example. A typical engineer would
</p>
<p>like to push insulation to the point where the investor does not lose money,
</p>
<p>implying that the project has a net present value (and hence annuity) of zero
</p>
<p>(indicated by point C). However, investors seek to maximize the net present
</p>
<p>value of the project, leading them to opt for a degree of insulation that minimizes
</p>
<p>their user cost of capital (recall that their capital has alternative uses, also outside
</p>
<p>the energy sector). The investor&rsquo;s optimum is marked as point B. Compared to the
</p>
<p>initial point A, there is an improvement of energy efficiency, which however still
</p>
<p>falls short of point C, which engineers consider economically viable.
</p>
<p>Optimization of energy efficiency is not easy in actual practice. Reductions in
</p>
<p>energy consumption depend on users&rsquo; individual behavior, which is unpredictable
</p>
<p>for the investor. In addition, devices often fail to reach their nameplate energy
</p>
<p>ratings. For instance, the newest generation of offshore wind turbines has been
</p>
<p>reported to have more downtime due to repair and maintenance than expected.
</p>
<p>Quite generally, the possibility of seemingly viable projects turning into loss-
</p>
<p>making ones cannot be ruled out.

<p>4.3.2 Determining Energy Efficiency Potential
</p>
<p>Often, more than just one opportunity for investment in energy efficiency presents
</p>
<p>itself. This situation calls for a ranking of projects according to their (marginal) cost
</p>
<p>of conserved energy (CCE), resulting in the staggered schedule labeled &lsquo;theoretical
</p>
<p>potential&rsquo; of Fig. 4.5. In accordance with inequality (4.19), the CCE values are
</p>
<p>compared to the unit price pE of avoided energy consumption. Note that pE
corresponds to the marginal return on investment. For the attainment of economic
</p>
<p>efficiency, marginal cost needs to equal marginal return. This condition is satisfied
</p>
<p>at point A of the figure.
</p>
<p>A further complication is that efficiency-enhancing measures may influence
</p>
<p>each other. For example, installing turbines that are more efficient in converting
</p>
<p>hydro power into electricity often makes economic sense only if the voltage of
</p>
<p>power lines delivering the energy generated is increased as well. However, the
</p>
<p>efficiency gain thanks to higher voltage is limited by the capacity of the entire
</p>
<p>network. This bottleneck may prevent the new turbines from reaching their name-
</p>
<p>plate efficiency.
</p>
<p>An iterative procedure is necessary in the presence of multiple projects. The
</p>
<p>initial step is to select the measure with the lowest CCE value, as before. Next, the
</p>
<p>marginal cost of all other measures needs to be calculated anew, adjusting their
</p>
<p>multipliers ΔI/ΔE (see inequality (4.19) once again). Usually, this adjustment is
</p>
<p>upward, indicating that a given reduction in energy consumption now requires an
</p>
<p>increased investment. If the next-best investment still satisfies inequality (4.19), it
</p>
<p>can be added to the program&mdash;again with the consequence that the CCE values of
</p>
<p>the remaining projects have to be determined anew. Note that this procedure still
</p>
<p>revolves around theoretically given efficiency potentials.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Yet theoretical potentials cannot be achieved in actual practice, as indicated by
</p>
<p>the distance between the dashed and solid schedules shown in Fig. 4.5. The gap
</p>
<p>between them has several causes:
</p>
<p>&ndash; The implementation of efficiency-enhancing measures entails transaction costs,
</p>
<p>for example, for planning, engineering, and financing.
</p>
<p>&ndash; According to the so-called rebound effect, energy efficiency measures have a
</p>
<p>much smaller impact on energy consumption than anticipated by simple
</p>
<p>calculations. A successfully implemented efficiency measure causes the cost of
</p>
<p>the associated energy service to decline, but this may stimulate the demand for
</p>
<p>this service. The increased efficiency of lighting provides a famous example. It
</p>
<p>lowers the cost of lighting but multiplies the use of electric light. A more indirect
</p>
<p>rebound effect is that the lowered cost of an energy service (e.g. space heating)
</p>
<p>enables consumers to purchase more other goods and services, which may have
</p>
<p>substantial energy requirements of their own.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The so-called persistence effect refers to inertia on the part of investors and
</p>
<p>consumers, stating that efficiency-enhancing measures and investments are
</p>
<p>undertaken only when appliances, buildings, and vehicles need to be replaced.
</p>
<p>There are economically viable prospects for the reduction of energy consump-
</p>
<p>tion (corresponding to point B of Fig. 4.5), as has been confirmed in many empirical
</p>
<p>studies. However, the effective amount of attainable reduction remains contested
</p>
<p>ground. Many observers attribute the gap between theoretical and effective poten-
</p>
<p>tial to market failure, a topic taken up next.
</p>
<p>4.3.3 Energy Efficiency: A Case of Market Failure?
</p>
<p>Engineering specialists often claim that even cost-minimizing measures designed to
</p>
<p>improve energy efficiency are not undertaken. Since the markets involved (for
</p>
<p>appliances, buildings, and vehicles as well as engineering services) are reasonably
</p>
<p>competitive, there is no reason to suspect suppression of innovation by a monopo-
</p>
<p>list. Economists have advanced the following explanations (see Sorrell 2004 in
</p>
<p>particular). On the whole, they suggest that much of what is seen as market failure
</p>
<p>by engineers, environmentalists, and politicians in fact reflect rational decisions by
</p>
<p>households and businesses.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Perceived irrelevance of efficiency-enhancing measures: Research has shown
</p>
<p>that many energy consumers&mdash;large and small&mdash;have little knowledge of the
</p>
<p>options, technologies, and costs of efficiency-enhancing measures. Yet from an
</p>
<p>economic point of view, this ignorance can be rational. After all, information
</p>
<p>gathering entails costly effort (e.g. management time) with certainty, while
</p>
<p>returns are uncertain (they are zero if one finds inequality (4.19) not to be
</p>
<p>satisfied). Applying the economic decision rule, &ldquo;marginal cost equal expected
</p>
<p>marginal return&rdquo;, risk-averse potential investors stop collecting information at
</p>
<p>82 4 Bottom-Up Analysis of Energy Demand</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>an early stage. In addition, their perception that effort directed at improvements
</p>
<p>in energy efficiency do not pay off may make them put expected returns close to
</p>
<p>zero, preventing information gathering from the beginning. Expectations of
</p>
<p>slowly rising prices or taxation of energy are hardly sufficient to change this.
</p>
<p>It likely takes shock-like energy price hikes and supply crises for the decision
</p>
<p>rule cited above to be affected.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Divergence of decision-making powers (investor/user problem): In many cases,
</p>
<p>the economic benefits of an efficiency-enhancing measure do not accrue to the
</p>
<p>investor. An important example is the case of rental housing. While owners pay
</p>
<p>for improved heat insulation and more efficient boilers, tenants benefit from the
</p>
<p>reduction in energy expenditure. It is easy to conclude that owners lack the
</p>
<p>economic incentive to implement these measures. However, this may not be
</p>
<p>fully true as soon as a change of occupancy is considered. Potential new tenants
</p>
<p>will likely consider the total cost of housing, which includes outlays on energy.
</p>
<p>This gives owners an incentive to invest in energy efficiency.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Myopia of decision-makers (see Hausman and Joskow 1982): Potential investors
</p>
<p>demand so-called payback times of a few months (in the case of households) or a
</p>
<p>few years (in the case of companies) when it comes to energy efficiency. This
</p>
<p>means that the reduction in energy expenditure must be sufficient to &lsquo;pay back&rsquo;
</p>
<p>the investment outlay over a short time period. In terms of inequality (4.19)
</p>
<p>above, investors either think that they have alternatives outside the energy sector
</p>
<p>yielding a high internal rate of return IRR or estimate the useful life T of the
</p>
<p>project to be short, either resulting in a low value of AVFi,T. This behavior of
</p>
<p>course clashes with the requirements of the energy economy, which tends to
</p>
<p>revolve around big investments with long payback periods.
</p>
<p>Table 4.4 presents an example of two electrical heating systems A and B that
</p>
<p>have identical properties except that B is more efficient but calls for a higher
</p>
<p>investment outlay. Its extra investment outlay ΔI amounts to 2830 EUR. In return,
</p>
<p>its energy consumption is lower by 4500 kWh/year than B&rsquo;s. According to AVF0.1,10
&frac14; 6.145, the investment outlay is to be distributed over 6.145 (rather than 10) years.
Capital user cost thus amounts to 2830/6.145 &frac14; 460.5 EUR annually, or 0.102
EUR/kWh, respectively. This is the cost of conserved energy CCE. As it is below
</p>
<p>0.15 EUR/kWh, the assumed electricity price, the energy-efficient alternative
</p>
<p>B would be profitable. To calculate the internal rate of return IRR of this project,
</p>
<p>one has to set AN &frac14; 0 in condition (4.18) and solve for PVFi,T,
</p>
<p>PVFi,T &frac14;

</p>
<p>pE ΔE
&frac14; 2830
</p>
<p>675
&frac14; 4:192: &eth;4:20&THORN;
</p>
<p>Using trial-and-error over the interest rate i, it turns out that (4.20) holds for an
</p>
<p>interest rate i &frac14; 20% (assuming T &frac14; 10 years).
An internal rate of return of 20% is comparatively high; still, there are empirical
</p>
<p>studies showing that many projects designed to improve energy efficiency are not
</p>
<p>realized although their IRR exceeds that of other investments. This absence of
</p>
<p>4.3 Energy Efficiency 83</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>so-called interest arbitrage normally is interpreted as a sign of irrationality. Yet
</p>
<p>there are reasons to doubt this interpretation:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Companies are often subject to credit rationing, meaning that banks limit the
</p>
<p>amount of finance provided. Given limited financing, companies must set
</p>
<p>investment priorities. However, investments in energy efficiency are usually
</p>
<p>regarded as less important for economic survival than investments in new
</p>
<p>products or market development, causing them to be shelved despite high
</p>
<p>expected returns.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Returns on investments in energy efficiency are often high as a result of public
</p>
<p>subsidies; yet governments may fail to honor their commitments. In fact, the
</p>
<p>public sector often is the laggard in terms of energy efficiency when it comes to
</p>
<p>its buildings and infrastructure.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Companies outside the energy sector are not familiar with the peculiarities and
</p>
<p>uncertainties of energy markets. For them, investment in energy efficiency is
</p>
<p>fraught with increased risk, causing them to demand a higher expected rate of
</p>
<p>return (note that interest arbitrage in fact means equality of risk-adjusted rates of
</p>
<p>return).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Investors may also suffer from an asymmetry of information. They have to rely
</p>
<p>on the advice of experts or product descriptions for estimating expected
</p>
<p>reductions in energy expenditure. Since this information is rarely impartial,
</p>
<p>they may deem such estimates to be overly optimistic.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The useful life of an investment in energy efficiency often falls short of its
</p>
<p>expected value. For instance, a household may have to move in search of
</p>
<p>employment. Prospective buyers are usually not willing to honor the extra
</p>
<p>investment outlay in full, causing the investment in energy efficiency to not
</p>
<p>fully pay off.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Regarding alleged myopia, decision-makers expect future technological change,
</p>
<p>which will cause a fall in the value of their investment. By deferring their
</p>
<p>decision, they retain the option of realizing the project later, benefitting from

<p>an increased IRR. Of course, this option comes at a price, which is equal to the
</p>
<p>opportunity cost of not investing, i.e. the forgone reduction of energy expendi-
</p>
<p>ture in the present context.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.6 illustrates the optional nature of an unimplemented efficiency-
</p>
<p>enhancing measure. Its horizontal axis depicts the value of the asset (liability if
</p>
<p>negative) considered 1 year hence (the &lsquo;underlying&rsquo; in the jargon of finance). In this
</p>
<p>case, this is a potential liability whose value amounts to the cost of conserved
</p>
<p>energy CCE. Should the CCE value be lower than at present (e.g. corresponding to
</p>
<p>point B), then the decision-maker is happy to have deferred his or her decision; the
</p>
<p>option is &lsquo;in the money&rsquo;. At point A, the CCE value 1 year later is the same as at
</p>
<p>present. In this case, the investor already bears a cost in the guise of the forgone
</p>
<p>reduction of energy expenditure pE�ΔE. Conversely, the CCE value may turn out to
be higher 1 year later, e.g. because wages of construction workers have increased.
</p>
<p>In this case, the investor regrets having waited: the option is &lsquo;out of the money&rsquo;. The
</p>
<p>price to be paid for the waiting is called the &lsquo;option premium&rsquo;. It equals to pE�ΔE,
the forgone reduction of energy expenditure. Note that that pE�ΔE does not vary
with CCE, making it a constant.
</p>
<p>Yet how can one judge whether waiting pays or not? The answer to this question
</p>
<p>requires the determination of the option premium, which is the topic of real options
</p>
<p>theory (see e.g. Schwartz and Trigeorgis 2004 and Sect. 3.6).
</p>
<p>4.3.4 Contracting
</p>
<p>In markets characterized by asymmetry of information and interest arbitrage, there
</p>
<p>is scope for intermediaries. In the case of improvements in energy efficiency, the
</p>
<p>function of the intermediary is assumed by so-called contractors. They provide
</p>
<p>customers (owners or operators of property, swimming pools, hospitals, industrial
</p>
<p>plant, and exhibition parks, to name just a few) with specialized services. These
</p>
<p>services include the analysis, planning, installation, financing, management,

<p>servicing, and maintenance of efficiency-enhancing investments. In the case of a
</p>
<p>block heating power station, the services may comprise capacity planning,
</p>
<p>financing, the construction of the plant, and optimization of daily operations. At
</p>
<p>contract expiry, the facility is handed over to its final owner. Contractors benefit
</p>
<p>from the interest arbitrage explained above. They can derive a profit from the
</p>
<p>difference between the internal rate of return on investments in energy efficiency
</p>
<p>and the rate they have to pay on the capital market.
</p>
<p>The commissioning of a specialist contractor can be attractive for customers who
</p>
<p>do not want to be exposed to the risks associated with energy supply while
</p>
<p>benefitting from the cost reductions afforded by improvements in energy efficiency.
</p>
<p>Yet contracting is not without its own costs and risks, which prevent it from
</p>
<p>reaching its full potential in actual practice. The following problems can be cited:
</p>
<p>&ndash; A contracting project calls for an evaluation of the future energy requirements
</p>
<p>and an identification of the cost-minimizing portfolio of efficiency-enhancing
</p>
<p>measures. These activities can be quite costly.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Improvements in efficiency imply that energy requirements fall over time.
</p>
<p>However, they may rise again because the customer boosts production in order
</p>
<p>to meet an increased demand for its goods and services. Therefore, the net
</p>
<p>present value of the project can only be determined through modeling.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Conflicts over the terms and conditions of the contract may arise. For a banal
</p>
<p>example, is the contractor or the final owner, represented by the facility manager,
</p>
<p>responsible for the replacement of a defective light?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Conflicts also may arise because of changes in laws and regulations during the
</p>
<p>life of the contract that were not foreseen at its conclusion. They typically cause
</p>
<p>delays, which tie up costly capital. Who is to bear the extra capital user cost?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Contractors usually do not have rights to the property upon which the facility
</p>
<p>(e.g. a block heating plant) is built. They therefore lack collateral in the event
</p>
<p>that the customer becomes insolvent before contract expiry.5
</p>
<p>&ndash; Contracting projects in the rental housing market have limited appeal to final
</p>
<p>owners as long as they cannot shift costs incurred to their tenants. However,
</p>
<p>there are still legal ambiguities to be resolved in this context.
</p>
<p>&ndash; When a contract approaches expiry, contractors are tempted to act
</p>
<p>opportunistically, neglecting their servicing and maintenance obligations. The
</p>
<p>consequence is that promised improvements of energy efficiency (and hence
</p>
<p>rates of return on investment) are not achieved. Doubts about the reliability of
</p>
<p>service providers weaken potential customers&rsquo; interest in the contracting busi-
</p>
<p>ness model.
</p>
<p>Clearly, contracting projects must generate significant cost savings to be
</p>
<p>realized. In the past, they have been largely confined to the public sector. There,
</p>
<p>5Because of their low risk of insolvency, public authorities are preferred customers in the
</p>
<p>contracting business.

<p>authorities are caught between a lack of financing in view of budget deficits and
</p>
<p>pressure to improve maintenance of public properties while saving on energy-
</p>
<p>related operating cost. For them, contracting is an attractive solution. With increas-
</p>
<p>ing experience, rising prices of energy prices, and support by public authorities such
</p>
<p>as the European Commission, contracting may in future expand to the private
</p>
<p>sector.

<p>Top-Down Analysis of Energy Demand 5
</p>
<p>The practical use of bottom-up models for analyzing energy demand is faced with
</p>
<p>significant micro-data requirements. In order to keep such models manageable, the
</p>
<p>individual components of energy demand are usually linked to the same macroeco-
</p>
<p>nomic variables such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), per-capita income, and
</p>
<p>relative energy prices. This gives rise to the question, &ldquo;Why not model energy
</p>
<p>demand directly as a function of these macro variables?&rdquo;. This macro approach is
</p>
<p>presented in this chapter, exploring the role of population growth, economic
</p>
<p>growth, and in particular changes in relative prices. However, this approach raises
</p>
<p>issues of its own:
</p>
<p>&ndash; How does one differentiate between short-term and long-term adjustments of
</p>
<p>demand?
</p>

<p>5.1 Population Growth

</p>
<p>between population POPt and the aggregate energy demand Et,

: &eth;5:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>Therefore, the logarithmic differentiation of Eq. (5.1) yields the percentage
</p>
<p>change in energy demand as the sum of the percentage change in population and
</p>
<p>the per-capita energy demand, at least to a first approximation. The development of
</p>
<p>the demand for energy is thus tautologically given by the sum of population growth
</p>
<p>and change of per-capita energy consumption.
</p>
<p>Table 5.1 shows the corresponding values and their percentage changes between
</p>
<p>2000 and 2011. In 2011, the world population of nearly 7 bn people consumed 12.7
</p>
<p>bn toe of commercial energy. However, while the per-capita energy consumption in
</p>
<p>China grew by no less than 7.5% p.a., it declined in several developed countries.
</p>
<p>Evidently there must be other factors at work beyond population growth that
</p>
<p>explain the demand for energy and its trend. Population growth alone is a
</p>
<p>misleading indicator.
</p>
<p>However, population is of importance in a different context. Table 5.1 reveals
</p>
<p>substantial differences in per-capita energy consumption between countries. In the
</p>
<p>United States it is roughly twice as high as in Germany or Japan. With 0.17 toe per
</p>
<p>capita, the figure for Indonesia (as of 2011) is at the other end of the spectrum. The
</p>
<p>90 5 Top-Down Analysis of Energy Demand</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>international disparities in energy consumption can be visualized by the so-called
</p>
<p>Lorenz curve. On the horizontal axis of Fig. 5.1, countries are ranked according to
</p>
<p>their shares of the world&rsquo;s population, with e.g. China accounting for the first 20%.
</p>
<p>The vertical axis exhibits the countries&rsquo; respective shares of global energy con-
</p>
<p>sumption. If per-capita energy consumption were completely equal among
</p>
<p>countries, the Lorenz curve would be a diagonal running from point (0; 0) to
</p>
<p>point (1; 1). With increasing inequality, the Lorenz curve moves away from this
</p>
<p>straight line. According to the solid line, 60% of the world population accounted for
</p>
<p>only 17% of energy consumption in 2002.1
</p>
<p>Yet the dashed Lorenz curve of Fig. 5.1 shows that income inequality between
</p>
<p>countries is even more marked than energy inequality, with 60% of the world
</p>
<p>population disposing of about 8% of world income only. This difference is an
</p>
<p>expression of the fact that energy has to be regarded as an essential good. Poor
</p>
<p>people devote a bigger share of their income to it than the rich. This observation
</p>
<p>suggests that the demand for energy increases less than proportionally with increas-
</p>
<p>ing income. Therefore, the so-called income elasticity of energy demand is smaller
</p>
<p>than one in the long run (see Sect. 5.2).
</p>
<p>The World Energy Council (1993) stipulated 1.5 toe per capita as the benchmark
</p>
<p>to ensure economic and social development. This implies that global energy
</p>
<p>consumption would have to be about 40% higher than at present. The extent to

</p>
<p>5.2 Economic Growth
</p>
<p>An increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the associated creation of value
</p>
<p>usually require an increased use of energy while at the same time leading to an
</p>
<p>improved capacity to pay for it. Similar to the tautology of Sect. 5.1, GDP can be

</p>
<p>After taking logarithms, the relative change in energy demand can be expressed

</p>
<p>According to Table 5.2, energy intensity has decreased substantially between
</p>
<p>2000 and 2011 in all countries sampled. Hence, consumption of energy has been

<p>increasing less than per-capita income, implying that the income elasticity of

countries, many of which are characterized by a backlog of demand at the

<p>going price.2 This backlog is usually created by an artificially low price of
</p>
<p>energy imposed by the government.

<p>2This statement serves as a reminder that actual energy consumption is interpreted as the outcome
</p>
<p>of supply and demand, both of which depend (among other things) on the relative price of energy.
</p>
<p>However, when the government fixes price below its equilibrium value, the quantity demanded
</p>
<p>exceeds the quantity supplied, creating a backlog in demand.
</p>
<p>5.2 Economic Growth 93</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When GDP data of different years are to be compared, adjustment for inflation is
</p>
<p>necessary, as explained in Sect. 3.3. For international comparisons of energy
</p>
<p>intensity, one also has to convert GDP values expressed in national currency into
</p>
<p>a common currency (e.g. USD or EUR). In view of short-term exchange rate
</p>
<p>fluctuations, the average of a year (1995 in Table 5.2) or an average over several
</p>
<p>years (as is World Bank practice) may be the appropriate choice for depicting
</p>
<p>development over time.
</p>
<p>Currency conversion can also be based on purchasing power parity (PPP),
</p>
<p>estimates of which are published by the OECD and the World Bank. This is a
</p>
<p>virtual exchange rate between two currencies, based on the notion that tradable
</p>
<p>goods have the same price everywhere. For example, if a hamburger costs 4 USD in
</p>
<p>the United States but 3 EUR in France (say), then 1 USD is apparently worth 0.75
</p>
<p>EUR. When the hamburger is replaced by a basket of goods and services, one
</p>
<p>obtains the PPP. For most developing countries the application of PPP results in
</p>
<p>higher GDP values and hence lower estimates of energy intensity.3While exchange
</p>
<p>rates between industrialized countries tend to be closer to PPP values, there are
</p>
<p>deviations even in the EUR-USD exchange rate, as shown in Fig. 5.2.
</p>
<p>5.3 The Price of Energy
</p>
<p>The price of energy and its development over time (relative to the prices of other
</p>
<p>goods and services) are crucial determinants of the demand for energy. Considering
</p>
<p>the swath of energy prices, it is not easy to calculate a representative energy price
</p>
<p>index. Even for a given energy source, more than one price often exists. An

</p>
<p>3The difficulty here is to establish the appropriate basket of goods and services. Goods and services
</p>
<p>have different weights between countries. In addition, price differences are justified by quality
</p>
<p>differentials, which must be filtered out. An alternative to taking a comprehensive basket of goods
</p>
<p>is to select one single good that is globally available. In the hamburger example, this results in the
</p>
<p>so-called Big Mac parity.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>aggregated energy price index is constructed by weighting energy sources by their
</p>
<p>market shares. Since economic theory predicts that demand mainly depends on
</p>
<p>relative prices besides income or wealth, this index must be related to a macroeco-
</p>
<p>nomic price index (consumer price index, producer price index, or price index of
</p>
<p>the GDP). This ratio is often called the real price of energy. An increase over time
</p>
<p>signifies that energy prices grow faster than the average price of goods and services
</p>
<p>in general.
</p>
<p>5.3.1 Short-Term and Long-Term Price Elasticities
</p>
<p>Similar to the income elasticity, the energy own-price elasticity (often simply called
</p>
<p>price elasticity for short) is defined by using a change in the real price of energy pE
as the impulse,

: &eth;5:7&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here as well, several cases need to be distinguished.
</p>
<p>&ndash; �1 &lt; ηE,pE &lt; 0: The demand for energy is inelastic (to price). If the price of
energy goes up (relative to the rate of inflation), the quantity of energy demanded
</p>
<p>declines less than proportionally (e.g. price goes up 10% but quantity sold only
</p>
<p>4%, leaving a bottom line of 6% to sellers). This implies that inelastic demand
</p>
<p>results in a strong market position for suppliers (often called a seller&rsquo;s market).
</p>
<p>&ndash; ηE,pE &lt; �1: Demand for energy is elastic. If the (relative) price of energy
increases, the quantity demanded declines more than proportionally (for instance
</p>
<p>a 10% price hike triggers a 12% fall in quantity sold, resulting in a bottom line of
</p>
<p>�2%). Elastic demand causes the market position of consumers to be strong
(often called a buyer&rsquo;s market).
</p>
<p>When energy markets become tight, the relative price of energy rises and the
</p>
<p>quantity traded decreases. This situation is shown in Fig. 5.3, where the supply
</p>
<p>curve shifts to the left. The original market equilibrium A is replaced by the one at
</p>
<p>point B, where the new supply function intersects with the short-term energy
</p>
<p>demand function. At first, a marked price hike combines with a limited decrease
</p>
<p>in quantity because immediate adjustment would be very costly for consumers.
</p>
<p>They often need to undertake an investment (e.g. by buying a car with higher fuel
</p>
<p>efficiency), a decision that is made only if the price change is viewed as permanent.
</p>
<p>Once undertaken, consumer adjustment gives rise to the long-term demand function
</p>
<p>(dotted line in Fig. 5.3), which is flatter (more price elastic) than its short-term
</p>
<p>counterpart and thus lies closer to the origin in the neighborhood of point B. This
</p>
<p>indicates reduced energy consumption at a given price, at least in the neighborhood
</p>
<p>of the initial equilibrium. Compared to B, the energy price drops slightly while the
</p>
<p>5.3 The Price of Energy 95</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>quantity traded continues to decrease until the new long-term equilibrium C is
</p>
<p>reached.
</p>
<p>In normal circumstances, energy demand is a composite of demand for different
</p>
<p>energy sources Ei, i &frac14; 1,. . ., N with their relative prices pi. This consideration gives
rise to an extended definition of price elasticity,

</p>
<p>Ei
: &eth;5:8&THORN;
</p>
<p>For i &frac14; j one obtains the own-price elasticity, for i 6&frac14; j a so-called cross-price
elasticity. While normally the own-price elasticity is negative, the cross-price
</p>
<p>elasticity can be of either sign. If the energy sources considered are substitutes, it
</p>
<p>is positive because a price increase dpj &gt; 0 leads to a response dEj &lt; 0, which
triggers more demand for Ei, thus dEj &gt; 0. Yet Ei and Ej can also be complemen-
tary, in which case the cross-price elasticity is negative. A price increase dpj &gt; 0
again leads to a response dEj &lt; 0, which now causes a reduction dEi &lt; 0 in the
complementary input Ei.

</p>
<p>96 5 Top-Down Analysis of Energy Demand</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Here, E(t) symbolizes aggregate energy demand (in physical units), GDP(t), the
</p>
<p>real (inflation-adjusted) Gross Domestic Product, and pE(t) the relative price of
</p>
<p>energy.
</p>
<p>This formulation is partial rather than of the general-equilibrium type for three
</p>
<p>reasons:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Consider a drop in the quantity of energy transacted. As the oil price shocks of
</p>
<p>1973/1974 and 1979/1980 clearly demonstrated, this does not leave GDP unaf-
</p>
<p>fected. Therefore a reverse causality exists, running from E(t) to GDP(t).
</p>
<p>&ndash; The observed consumption of energy is the outcome of an interaction between
</p>
<p>supply and demand. For example, if an increase in GDP causes the demand
</p>
<p>function to shift outward, the relative price of energy is predicted to go up. This
</p>
<p>time, causality runs fromGDP(t) to pE(t); superficially, it even seems to run from

</p>
<p>&ndash; For all its importance, energy is just one factor of production both for households
</p>
<p>and firms. Therefore, a change in the relative price of energy has repercussions
</p>
<p>on the mix of factors of production. As a consequence, energy price
</p>
<p>developments may change inputs of other factors of production, which has an
</p>
<p>impact not only on the composition but also the size of GDP.
</p>
<p>In keeping with the partial approach, economic theory indeed states that aggre-
</p>
<p>gate energy demand is determined by income and the relative price of energy. A
</p>
<p>mostly analogous formulation to Eq. (5.9) is
</p>
<p>E t&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>POP t&eth; &THORN;
&frac14; α �

<p>GDP t&eth; &THORN;

</p>
<p>� �β
</p>
<p>� pE t&eth; &THORN;
γ &eth;5:10&THORN;
</p>
<p>with POP denoting the resident population. While the parameter α is a constant
</p>
<p>determining the general level of demand, β represents the income elasticity, and γ
</p>
<p>the price elasticity, respectively. This can be shown either by taking logarithms or
</p>
<p>by partial differentiation. In the latter case, one obtains
</p>
<p>&part;E t&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>&part;GDP t&eth; &THORN;
&frac14; α � β � GDP t&eth; &THORN;β�1 � pE t&eth; &THORN;

</p>
<p>GDP t&eth; &THORN;
: &eth;5:11&THORN;
</p>
<p>Multiplication of both sides by GDP(t)/E(t) yields β as the income elasticity ηE,
</p>
<p>GDP. Turning to the relative price of energy, one has
</p>
<p>&part;E t&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>&part;pE t&eth; &THORN;

</p>
<p>Multiplication by pE(t)/E(t) shows that γ &frac14; ηE,Pe.
As it stands, the partial model does not permit to distinguish between short-term
</p>
<p>and long-term elasticities. This distinction is important because current energy
</p>
<p>consumption is the result of a reaction not only to current income and price, but
</p>
<p>5.3 The Price of Energy 97</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>also to past incomes and prices through the inherited stock of energy-using capital.
</p>
<p>This also implies that current energy consumption is to some extent determined by
</p>
<p>past energy consumption. The stronger this link, the longer it takes for a change in
</p>
<p>income or price to exert its full impact.
</p>
<p>Two variants of this modified demand model are discussed in the literature. The
</p>
<p>stock adjustment hypothesis posits that consumers orient themselves to a desired
</p>
<p>(planned) energy consumption Ep(t), which is a function of the desired stock of
</p>
<p>energy-using capital. In addition, the hypothesis assumes that this stock and hence
</p>
<p>planned energy consumption is determined by current income and the current
</p>
<p>relative price of energy, resulting in
</p>
<p>Ep t&eth; &THORN; &frac14; α � GDP t&eth; &THORN;
β � pE t&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>γ: &eth;5:13&THORN;
</p>
<p>During any given period t, however, there is a discrepancy between desired and
</p>
<p>actual (inherited) stock because adjustment is partial in view of its cost. If adjust-
</p>
<p>ment is completed up to a portion (1�ρ) of the gap while ρ still is to be undertaken,
one has
</p>
<p>E t&eth; &THORN; &frac14; Ep t&eth; &THORN;
1�ρ � E t� 1&eth; &THORN;ρ with 0 &lt; ρ &lt; 1: &eth;5:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>The parameter ρ reflects the speed of adjustment. In the case of ρ&frac14; 0, adaptation
to new market conditions happens without any delay, while in the case ρ &frac14; 1 no
adjustment occurs at all. Note that ρ is to some degree an economic decision
</p>
<p>variable reflecting the benefits and costs of fast versus slow adjustment. This
</p>
<p>adjustment of the stock of energy-using capital is not explicitly modeled, in contrast
</p>
<p>with Eq. (4.1).
</p>
<p>By substituting Eq. (5.14) into (5.13), one obtains according to the stock
</p>
<p>adjustment hypothesis,
</p>
<p>E t&eth; &THORN; &frac14; α1�ρ � GDP t&eth; &THORN;β� 1�ρ&eth; &THORN; � pE t&eth; &THORN;
γ� 1�ρ&eth; &THORN; � E t� 1&eth; &THORN;ρ: &eth;5:15&THORN;
</p>
<p>The second approach is called habit persistence hypothesis. It states that the
</p>
<p>energy consumption E(t) of period t is a function of expected future income GDPe
</p>
<p>(t) and expected relative energy price pE
e(t) rather than their current values,
</p>
<p>E t&eth; &THORN; &frac14; α � GDPe t&eth; &THORN;β � p eE t&eth; &THORN;
γ: &eth;5:16&THORN;
</p>
<p>Of course, an auxiliary hypothesis concerning the formation of expectations is
</p>
<p>needed. A popular alternative has been adaptive expectations, meaning that
</p>
<p>expectations are formed as an extrapolation from previous and current observation.
</p>
<p>If again a geometric mean is postulated, the pertinent functions read

<p>Here, 0&lt; ρ&lt; 1 denotes the parameter of adjustment as before, which now refers
to expectations rather than the stock of energy-using capital. By substituting these

</p>
<p>by Eq. (5.16), Eq. (5.15) is obtained, with expected signs α, β &gt; 0, γ &lt; 0, and
0 &lt; ρ &lt; 1.
</p>
<p>In both approaches, energy demand E(t) of period t (the dependent variable) is
</p>
<p>thus a function of incomeGDP(t), relative energy price pE(t), and energy demand of
</p>
<p>the previous period E(t&ndash;1), the lagged dependent variable. In order to estimate the
</p>
<p>parameters, appropriate data must be collected and econometric methods applied.
</p>
<p>In the case of model (5.18) a testable linear specification results when taking logs
</p>
<p>and adding an error term ε(t),
</p>

</p>
<p>The short-term income elasticity is β(1&ndash;ρ) &gt; 0, the short-term price elasticity, γ
(1&ndash;ρ)&lt; 0. The long-term elasticities follow from considering the situation in which
all impulses of a one-time income or price change have exerted their full effect,
</p>
<p>resulting in perfect adjustment (the unobserved energy-using stock of capital is
</p>
<p>constant). This means that energy demand is stationary,
</p>
<p>E t&eth; &THORN; &frac14; E t� 1&eth; &THORN;: &eth;5:20&THORN;
</p>
<p>In a stationary situation the time index may be omitted, resulting in

<p>E &frac14; α1�ρ � GDPβ� 1�ρ&eth; &THORN; � pE
γ� 1�ρ&eth; &THORN; � Eρ &frac14; α � GDPβ � p γE: &eth;5:21&THORN;
</p>
<p>Therefore, β represents the long-term income elasticity and γ the long-term price
</p>
<p>elasticity. They can be obtained by dividing the estimated coefficients of Eq. (5.19)
</p>
<p>by the estimated ρ pertaining to the lagged dependent variable. The mean adjust-
</p>
<p>ment time (number of periods) following a one-time income or price change equals
</p>
<p>1/(1&ndash;ρ). This follows from the fact that a discrepancy between desired and inherited
</p>
<p>energy consumption is reduced at the tune of 1&ndash;ρ per period. On average the
</p>
<p>discrepancy is thus eliminated in 1/(1&ndash;ρ) periods.
</p>
<p>Yet this model is based on assumptions that prove to be restrictive:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Rising and falling relative energy prices have a symmetric impact on energy
</p>
<p>demand, an assumption that is hardly plausible. So-called hysteresis is more
</p>
<p>likely, meaning that the consumption-reducing effect of a price hike continues
</p>
<p>even after price decreases again. After all, once equipment with higher energy
</p>
<p>efficiency is installed, it is not scrapped just because energy has become cheaper
</p>
<p>again. In order to model hysteresis, the price variable needs to be split in two,

</p>
<p>&ndash; In the demand model presented, the mean adjustment time 1/(1&ndash;ρ) is indepen-
</p>

</p>
<p>This assumption can be relaxed as well. For simplicity, consider the extreme
</p>
<p>case where the demand for energy reacts immediately to a change in income,
</p>
<p>while it reacts with a lag to a change in relative price, as before. In this case,

<p>The parameter β &gt; 0 represents the (short-term and long-term) elasticity, γ
(1&ndash;ρ) &lt; 0 the short-term and γ &lt; 0, the long-term price elasticity. The mean
adjustment time of energy demand to changes in price is once again 1/(1&ndash;ρ).
</p>
<p>&ndash; A further assumption is that both short-term and long-term elasticities are
</p>
<p>constant. In particular, they do not depend on current values of income and
</p>
<p>price of energy. However, dropping this assumption calls for a much more
</p>
<p>complex modeling for demand (e.g. using the so-called translog specification,
</p>
<p>see Sect. 5.3.3).
</p>
<p>Table 5.3 shows the results of a regression estimate of model (5.19) using annual
</p>
<p>data for the European Union and the United States covering the period from 1980 to
</p>
<p>2013. The dependent variable is crude oil demand per capita. The explanatory
</p>
<p>variables are inflation-adjusted per-capita income and inflation-adjusted price of
</p>
<p>Brent crude. Demand for crude oil is fairly well explained: The coefficient of
</p>
<p>determination R2 is between 0.88 and 0.91, indicating a high statistical fit. Though
</p>
<p>estimated income elasticities have the expected sign, they are statistically insignifi-
</p>
<p>cant at the 1% level. However, the price elasticities and the lagged dependent
</p>
<p>variable are statistically significant at the 1% level.
</p>
<p>Taking the results of Table 5.3 at face value, one is led to the following
</p>
<p>interpretation. In both the European Union and in the United States, the inflation-
</p>
<p>adjusted price of crude oil has a significant impact on demand. However, the long-
</p>
<p>term price elasticities are 0.220 or below in absolute value, which means that the
</p>
<p>demand for oil is inelastic. This view is confirmed by most econometric studies.
</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, consumers in the United States react with a shorter lag to oil
</p>
<p>price changes than Europeans.

<p>5.3.3 Substitution Between Energy and Capital
</p>
<p>According to the process analysis discussed in Sect. 4.3, the relationship between
</p>
<p>energy demand and aggregate capital stock is substitutional rather than limitational
</p>
<p>(fixed proportions), meaning there is a choice between more and less energy-
</p>
<p>intensive modes of production and consumption. Substitution of energy is therefore
</p>
<p>possible through investment in capital goods. More generally, a given output
</p>
<p>quantity Q can be produced using more or less energy input E and commensurately
</p>
<p>modified quantities of other production factors. This is formally expressed by a
</p>
<p>production function,
</p>
<p>Q &frac14; f K; L;E;M&eth; &THORN; &eth;5:27&THORN;
</p>
<p>which relates output Q to inputs of capital K, labor L, energy E, and materials
</p>
<p>M (non-energy raw materials). To be precise, Q denotes the maximum output
</p>
<p>achievable given the state of technology and input quantities, reflecting best
</p>
<p>practice.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.4 depicts the production function by means of a so-called isoquant. An
</p>
<p>isoquant shows the quantities of production factors K and E (with inputs of labor
</p>
<p>L and materials M held constant in the present case) that are needed to produce a
</p>
<p>given quantity Q. The isoquant thus summarizes the efficient production frontier for
</p>
<p>a given quantity of output, depicting uses of an available technology ranging from
</p>
<p>energy-intensive to capital-intensive. Specifically, production process II is an
</p>
<p>energy-intensive variant that in turn uses little capital, whereas process III is
</p>
<p>capital-intensive but saves on energy. Production processes I and IV can be
</p>
<p>disregarded because of their excessive use of costly inputs; indeed, only
</p>
<p>technologies II and III are efficient.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In order to decide which production alternative is minimum cost, the prices of
</p>
<p>production factors have to be considered. For K this is capital user cost pK, an
</p>
<p>annuity which reflects interest and depreciation (net of tax exemptions and
</p>
<p>subsidies); for L this is the wage rate (including non-wage labor costs) pL; for
</p>
<p>E this is the average energy purchase price pE; for M this is average unit cost pM.
</p>
<p>When L andM as well as their unit prices are held constant, all factor combinations
</p>
<p>that are compatible with constant total production cost lie on a straight line (the
</p>
<p>so-called isocost line; see Fig. 5.4). Per definition all points on the isocost line are
</p>
<p>characterized by constant total production cost,
</p>
<p>C &frac14; pKK &thorn; pEE&thorn; pLL&thorn; pMM: &eth;5:28&THORN;
</p>
<p>To calculate the slope of this line and neglecting L and M (thus dL &frac14; dM &frac14; 0),
this equation can be differentiated to become
</p>
<p>dC &frac14; 0 &frac14; pKdK &thorn; pEdE and therefore
dE
</p>
<p>dK
&frac14; �
</p>
<p>pK
pE
</p>
<p>:
&eth;5:29&THORN;
</p>
<p>Thus the slope of the isocost line is �pK/pE. Consider a reduction in energy use,
dE&lt; 0. If the unit price of energy pE is relatively high, the cost saving is substantial,
permitting to use a lot more capital K while holding cost constant. Therefore, dE/dK
</p>
<p>takes on a low (absolute) value in this case. Conversely, if energy is cheap
</p>
<p>compared to the user cost of capital, dE &lt; 0 generates a small cost saving which
creates little room for an increased use of capital since this is relatively expensive.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, dE/dK takes on a high (absolute) value in this case.
</p>
<p>Competitive pressure makes producers minimize cost. They therefore seek to
</p>
<p>attain the isocost line representing the lowest possible production cost. This is the
</p>
<p>one running closest to the origin in (K, E)-space, given the amount of output Q and
</p>
<p>hence the isoquant. Therefore, the isocost line needs to be tangent to the isoquant
</p>
<p>for cost minimization. This corresponds to the choice of technology II with its
</p>
<p>rather high energy intensity.
</p>
<p>Note that the isocost line of Fig. 5.4 has a fairly steep slope, reflecting a situation
</p>
<p>where energy is cheap compared to the user cost of capital (as reflected by the
</p>
<p>annuity; see Sect. 3.1). If energy were to become more expensive relative to capital,
</p>
<p>the isocost line would exhibit a reduced slope, thus favoring a more capital-
</p>
<p>intensive mode of production. Therefore, a change in relative prices is predicted
</p>
<p>to affect the choice of production process within the technology available. This
</p>
<p>constitutes producers&rsquo; short-run response, while the choice of technology (to be
</p>
<p>discussed in Sect. 5.4) amounts to their long-run adjustment.
</p>
<p>For a given technology, the curvature of the isoquant representing it evidently is
</p>
<p>of great importance. The more pronounced the curvature, the smaller is the adjust-
</p>
<p>ment in the factor mix in response to a given change in relative factor prices. In the
</p>
<p>extreme case of a limitational technology, isoquants have an angular shape, which
</p>
<p>means that there cannot be any adjustment to a change in relative prices. Producers

<p>The symmetry follows from dln(K/E) &frac14; �dln(E/K) and dln(pK/pE) &frac14; �dln(pE/

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>substitution between these factors is easy. With an elasticity of substitution σKE &frac14; 3
e.g., a 10% increase in the relative price of energy results in a 30% reduction of the
</p>
<p>E/K ratio. If σKE &frac14; 1.2, the E/K ratio falls by 12% only. In the extreme case of
σKE &frac14; 0, there is no substitution possibility between K and E but a fixed input
relationship between them (this amounts to a fixed-proportions (limitational) pro-
</p>
<p>duction function, also called Leontief production function; see Sect. 2.5).
</p>
<p>The situation becomes more complex when more than two production factors are
</p>
<p>considered. The partial elasticity of substitution defined above has to be replaced by
</p>
<p>the so-called Allen elasticity (see Allen 1938, Sect. 19.4). Any two factors of
</p>
<p>production may now be complementary rather than substitutive. For instance,
</p>
<p>labor has historically been substituted by capital and energy, making capital and
</p>
<p>energy complements in production. Since the elasticity of substitution is defined to
</p>
<p>be positive in the case of substitutability, the Allen elasticity is negative in the case
</p>
<p>of complementarities.
</p>
<p>This raises the question of whether energy and capital are complements or
</p>
<p>substitutes in the context of the four-factor production function Q &frac14; f(K, L, E,
M). This is an empirical question which can only be answered by applying econo-
</p>
<p>metric methods. In doing so, one usually prefers not to focus on the isoquants but
</p>
<p>rather on (minimum) cost, which is a scalar measure. As shown by Fig. 5.4, the
</p>
<p>isocost line contains the same information as the isoquant in the neighborhood of
</p>
<p>the minimum cost combination of inputs. Indeed the problem, &ldquo;Minimize produc-
</p>
<p>tion cost for a given output level&rdquo; leads to the same solution as the so-called dual
</p>
<p>formulation, &ldquo;Maximize output for a given cost budget&rdquo;. Thus, the dual to
</p>
<p>maximizing output given a cost constraint reads
</p>
<p>C &frac14; C Q; pK; pL; pE; pM&eth; &THORN; &frac14; Q � c pK; pL; pE; pM&eth; &THORN;: &eth;5:33&THORN;
</p>
<p>It states that minimum total cost C depends on the amount of output Q to be
</p>
<p>achieved and the (relative) prices of inputs. Since unit cost c is given by C/Q, one
</p>
<p>can also analyze unit cost c. Strictly speaking, this is possible only if scaling up by
</p>
<p>Q does not matter, i.e. if the cost function C(Q, pK, pL, pE, pM) is homogenous of the
</p>
<p>first degree in Q. This is the case when a change of all production factors
</p>
<p>(e.g. doubling all of them) leads to an analogous change (doubling) of output,
</p>
<p>amounting to constant returns to scale.
</p>
<p>This leaves the choice of functional form. Preferably, the functional form should
</p>
<p>not impose a priori restrictions on crucial parameters such as the elasticity of
</p>
<p>substitution. A popular solution is the so-called translog function (see Christensen
</p>
<p>et al. 1973; Berndt and Wood 1975). It results from a second-degree Taylor
</p>
<p>approximation to an arbitrary function, with the arguments and the dependent
</p>
<p>variable in logarithms. In the case of the average cost function, the translog form
</p>
<p>becomes

<p>Thus, the shares of K, L, E, and M can be linearly related to the logarithm of their

<p>prices pK, pL, pE, and pM, making estimation of the βij by ordinary least-squares
</p>
<p>(OLS) possible.
</p>
<p>Also, the Allen partial elasticities of substitution between capital and energy can
</p>
<p>be recovered from the cost shares and price elasticities as follows (see Allen 1938,
</p>
<p>Sects. 19.5 and 19.6),
</p>
<p>σKE &frac14;
ηK,pE &thorn; shE � ηE,pE
</p>
<p>shE
: &eth;5:37&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is intuitive: Energy and capital are substitutes if their cross-price elasticity
</p>
<p>ηK,pE is positive, resulting in a positive value of σKE (the own-price elasticity ηK,pE is
</p>
<p>always negative). Conversely, they are complements if their cross-price elasticity is
</p>
<p>strongly positive and the own-price elasticity of energy as well as its cost share shE
are small in absolute value, resulting in a negative value of σKE.
</p>
<p>Econometric estimation of substitution elasticities between energy and capital
</p>
<p>was motivated by the first oil price shock of 1973. Policy-makers wanted to know
</p>
<p>whether it was easy or difficult to substitute energy by other production factors, in
</p>
<p>particular capital. The first evidence exhibited in Table 5.4 was disappointing:
</p>
<p>106 5 Top-Down Analysis of Energy Demand</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Berndt and Wood (1975) found a complementary relation between energy and
</p>
<p>capital. Yet another estimate by Griffin and Gregory (1976) points to substitutabil-
</p>
<p>ity (σKE &frac14; 1.07). This triggered a lively discussion among economists (see
e.g. Solow 1987). Later studies using more recent data and including technological
</p>
<p>change also show ambiguous results. However, the estimate presented in the last
</p>
<p>column of Table 5.4 confirms substitutability between energy and capital once it is
</p>
<p>assumed that producers have a choice of technology. This leads to the conclusion
</p>
<p>that companies have not exhausted the substitutional potential suggested by
</p>
<p>bottom-up process analysis to the same extent as the potential for automation,
</p>
<p>which amounts to replacing labor by both capital and energy.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the relationship between energy and capital cannot be determined
</p>
<p>with sufficient precision even to this day. Likely reasons are the limited validity of
</p>
<p>aggregate data, difficulty in distinguishing between the short term and long term
</p>
<p>(K and Emay be complementary in the short run but substitutes in the long run), and
</p>
<p>the challenges posed by isolating the effects of technological change.
</p>
<p>5.4 Technological Change
</p>
<p>In economics, technological change is defined in the following way. Technological
</p>
<p>change enables a larger output Q to be produced with the same input quantities of
</p>
<p>capital K, labor L, energy E, and materials M. An equivalent way of expressing the
</p>
<p>same idea is to say that a given output quantity Q can be produced using smaller
</p>
<p>quantities of production factors. An improvement in quality is a possible
</p>
<p>outcome, too.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 5.6, technological change is depicted by a shift of the isoquant towards
</p>
<p>(and not away from) the origin of (K, E)-space. In the figure on the left, technologi-
</p>
<p>cal change does not affect the input mix as long as relative factor prices do not
</p>
<p>change, thus indicating neutral technological change with respect to energy and
</p>
<p>capital. In the figure on the right, technological change is energy-saving because the
</p>
<p>transition exhibits a lower E/K ratio at a given factor price ratio. Clearly, changing
</p>
<p>relative factor prices can also influence the choice of production technology, in
</p>
<p>addition to technological change.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A mathematical formulation of factor-augmenting technological change is the
</p>
<p>following (see Stoneman 1983),
</p>
<p>Q &frac14; f K; L;E;M&eth; &THORN; &frac14; g aK t&eth; &THORN;K; aL t&eth; &THORN;L; aE t&eth; &THORN;E; aM t&eth; &THORN;M&frac12; � &eth;5:38&THORN;
</p>
<p>where t denotes time and aK(t), aL(t), aE(t), and aM(t) are functions indicating
</p>
<p>factor-augmenting changes resulting in savings of capital, labor, energy, and
</p>
<p>materials. These functions may depend on investment in research and development,
</p>
<p>education and training of the labor force, improved management, institutional
</p>
<p>reforms, and much more. But if technological change is to be advantageous, these
</p>
<p>functions must obey

</p>
<p>Using these functions, the direction of technological change can be defined. For
</p>
<p>example, daL(t)/dt &gt; 0 while daK(t)/dt &frac14; daE(t)/dt &frac14; daM(t)/dt &frac14; 0 indicates labor-
saving technological change because only labor input is scaled up as it were (which
</p>
<p>implies less of it is actually used at unchanged relative factor prices). But if daL(t)/
</p>
<p>dt &frac14; daK(t)/dt &frac14; daE(t)/dt &frac14; daM(t)/dt, then all factors of production benefit from
technological change to the same degree, a case which is often referred to as Hicks-
</p>
<p>neutral technological change. In the past, however, technological change has not
</p>
<p>been neutral but first and foremost labor-saving. Using the expression for shi
derived from the translog unit cost function (5.36) and complementing it with γi�t
to reflect technological change, one obtains (see Binswanger 1974; Hunt 1986)5

<p>Hicks-neutral technological change is equivalent to γK &frac14; γL &frac14; γE &frac14; γM &frac14; 0.
However, using British industry data covering the years from 1960 to 1980, Hunt
</p>
<p>(1986) finds evidence suggesting γL &lt; γE &lt; γK. Therefore, in Great Britain at least,
technological innovation has been above all labor-saving. It has also been energy-
</p>
<p>saving, though hardly capital-saving.
</p>
<p>This finding gives rise to the question of which factors bring about such a bias to
</p>
<p>technological change. According to the induced bias hypothesis (see Stoneman
</p>
<p>1983, Chap. 4), the direction of the technological change is conditioned by the
</p>
<p>market, meaning it depends on the development of relative prices. This was first
</p>
<p>formulated by Hicks (1932, 124f),
</p>
<p>A change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur to invention, and
</p>
<p>to innovation of a particular kind&mdash;directed to economizing the use of a factor which has
</p>
<p>become relatively expensive.
</p>
<p>If the price of the production factor labor increases compared to the cost of other
</p>
<p>production factors, then labor-saving technological change will come about in due
</p>
<p>time. In addition to the movement along the isoquant as in Fig. 5.6, a change in the
</p>
<p>isoquant itself also takes place, which leads to a further substitution of labor even
</p>
<p>when relative factor prices no longer change.
</p>
<p>It can be argued that the oil crises of the 1970s with their twin price shocks have
</p>
<p>guided innovation efforts towards improved energy efficiency. Interestingly, these
</p>
<p>efforts continued into the 1990s when relative oil prices were lower again, possibly
</p>
<p>because of the (expected) scarcity of energy resources and governments aiming at
</p>
<p>reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting energy-efficient investments.
</p>
<p>Apparently, the price hikes triggered an enduring technological change which has
</p>
<p>decoupled the demand for energy from economic growth. Quite possibly, this
</p>
<p>decoupling will be enhanced by the renewed increase in the relative price of oil
</p>
<p>between 1999 and 2014. Historic case studies show that problem awareness in the
</p>
<p>energy industry has influenced the direction technological change (see Weizsäcker
</p>
<p>1988) as entrepreneurs hope to make a profit by developing energy-saving and
</p>
<p>environment-friendly technologies and products. These hoped-for innovation gains
</p>
<p>thus may play an important role in the future demand for energy.
</p>
<p>the factors of production. This feature can be taken into account by the capital vintage model

<p>Energy Reserves and Sustainability 6
</p>
<p>The finiteness of fossil energy sources gives rise to the question of whether
</p>
<p>sustainable economic development is possible at all since these resources will
</p>
<p>increasingly become scarce and even cease to be available. Resource econom-
</p>
<p>ics&mdash;the theory of dealing with the efficient use of exhaustible resources&mdash;has
</p>
<p>been addressing this problem. Grounded in the pertinent economic models, this
</p>
<p>chapter revolves around the following issues:
</p>
<p>&ndash; How are energy reserves measured and how large are they?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What is the optimal extraction strategy for the owners of an exhaustible
</p>
<p>resource?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What is the optimal rate of extraction from a welfare point of view?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Does market failure occur, i.e. are there systematic deviations from the optimal
</p>
<p>extraction path?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the consequences of the increasing physical scarcity of energy sources
</p>
<p>for the price of energy?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How far can these prices rise?
</p>
<p>However, the optimum from the point of resource economics, while resulting in
</p>
<p>an efficient use of exhaustible energy resources, need not be sustainable. The
</p>
<p>relationship between economic efficiency and (so-called weak) sustainability there-
</p>
<p>fore needs to be clarified. This leads to additional questions:
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the conditions that make sustainable development possible in spite of
</p>
<p>continued use of non-renewable energy sources?
</p>
<p>&ndash; For instance, does the global oil market satisfy these conditions?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What interventions might be called for in order to satisfy the conditions for weak
</p>
<p>sustainability?

<p>6.1 Resources and Reserves
</p>
<p>Whether a raw material constitutes a resource or not depends on available techno-
</p>
<p>logical know-how and the capability of using it. For example, the uranium isotope
</p>
<p>U235 became an energy resource only after control over nuclear fission was
</p>
<p>achieved. Next, &lsquo;resources&rsquo; have to be distinguished from &lsquo;reserves&rsquo; (see
</p>
<p>Table 6.1).
</p>
<p>Resources comprise all useful raw materials existing in the ground, including
</p>
<p>those whose deposits are only presumed to exist or are currently too costly to be
</p>
<p>extracted using available technologies. Reserves are those resources that exist with
</p>
<p>high probability and can be extracted at a cost below their market price. Accord-
</p>
<p>ingly, higher market prices can cause resources to become reserves. The same holds
</p>
<p>for increased efforts at exploring an assumed resource deposit and lowering the cost
</p>
<p>of a mining or extraction technology. Adding cumulated amounts extracted to the
</p>
<p>total stock of reserves and resources leads to an estimate of ultimately recoverable
</p>
<p>resources.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Following the World Petroleum Council, reserves are classified according to the
</p>
<p>probability of economically viable extraction (see Campbell and Laherrere 1996):
</p>
<p>&ndash; P (proved): probability of extraction &gt;90%;
&ndash; 2P (proved &thorn; probable): probability of extraction &gt;50%;
&ndash; 3P (proved &thorn; probable &thorn; possible): probability of extraction &gt;10%.
</p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as other financial
</p>
<p>regulators require that resource-extracting companies listed on the stock exchange
</p>
<p>use P-reserves when reporting their assets, whereas geologists as well as internal
</p>
<p>planners of resource companies use 2P-reserves as the relevant figure. As a conse-
</p>
<p>quence, published reserves can be higher merely due to reclassification of known
</p>
<p>deposits rather than new discoveries (resulting in so-called paper barrels). Indeed,
</p>
<p>experts such as the Texan investment banker Simmons claim that increases of oil
</p>
<p>reserves in recent years have been more due to such reclassifications than to the
</p>
<p>discovery of new deposits.
</p>
<p>6.1.1 Resources
</p>
<p>There is a multitude of publications concerning globally available energy resources.
</p>
<p>Estimates sometimes diverge substantially, as they are based on data provided by
</p>
<p>resource-extracting companies, governments, and independent experts.1 According
</p>
<p>to Table 6.2, the oil resources amount to 470 bn toe or 3400 bn bbl, respectively.
</p>
<p>Several models have been developed for determining the amount of an oil and
</p>
<p>gas resource that can be ultimately recovered. One of them is by geologist Hubbert
</p>
<p>(1956, 1962), stating that accumulated discoveries follow a logistic trajectory (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.1). Thus, when the industry is in its start-up phase, only few oil deposits are
</p>
<p>discovered. With more experience (and therefore decreasing marginal cost of
</p>
<p>exploration) the rate of discovery increases. However, when the bulk of existing

<p>Therefore, the history of discovery rates permits to infer the unknown resource
</p>
<p>stock S&mdash;provided Eq. (6.1) holds.
</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, however, this model is weak because it
</p>
<p>neglects exploration costs, technological change in exploration, resource prices as
</p>
<p>well as institutional conditions such as public versus private ownership of reserve
</p>
<p>deposits (Kaufmann and Cleveland 2001; Reynolds 2002). Moreover, the assumed
</p>
<p>symmetry between increasing and decreasing rates of discovery does not conform
</p>
<p>to reality.
</p>
<p>6.1.2 Static Range of Fossil Energy Reserves
</p>
<p>In spite of these qualifications, estimates of ultimate recoverable oil resources
</p>
<p>published in the literature seem to converge (see Fig. 6.2). This convergence may
</p>
<p>be the result of two opposing economic forces. On the one hand, reserves amount to
</p>
<p>an intermediate product since investment must be made in the exploration of
</p>
<p>deposits, in the purchasing of extraction rights, and in the enforcement of already
</p>
<p>acquired property rights. With decreasing global reserves, the price of oil is
</p>
<p>expected to increase, making it economically interesting to invest into the creation
</p>
<p>of additional reserves. Thus, changes in global reserves crucially depend on the
</p>
<p>expected value of exploration costs compared to expected oil prices. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, accumulated exploration leads to learning effects (see IEA 2000;
</p>
<p>Nakicenovic 2002), which are a major source of cost reductions. High oil prices
</p>
<p>and stepped-up exploration efforts have resulted in innovations (such as 3D seism
</p>
<p>in the 1990s and 4D seism and fracking since 2000) that serve to lower the cost of
</p>
<p>exploration. As stated by Adelman (1990), there is a permanent race between the
</p>
<p>decrease in the reserves remaining and the increase in technological knowledge.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Reserves constitute an asset that is necessary for long-run production planning,
</p>
<p>securing deliveries, and market presence. Moreover, they help a resource-extracting
</p>
<p>company to attain a favorable credit rating. However, the returns on the investment
</p>
<p>needed for the acquisition of this asset have low net present values if extraction of a
</p>
<p>new resource deposit starts far in the future (see Sect. 3.1). From an economic point
</p>
<p>of view, exploration efforts should be exerted to the point where their marginal cost
</p>
<p>is still covered by the increase in the present value of expected returns on the oil
</p>
<p>found. As a consequence, an individual resource-extracting company is predicted to
</p>
<p>have reserves that are neither excessive nor insufficient. Whether reserves are
</p>
<p>excessive or insufficient depends, among other things, on the future expected
</p>
<p>price of oil. However, the price of oil not only determines the individually optimal
</p>
<p>amount but also the global amount of resources. Higher (expected) oil prices tend to
</p>
<p>increase the global amount of resources, at least in the long term.
</p>
<p>A common indicator of remaining reserves is time to depletion (also called
</p>
<p>range). In its static variant, this is the ratio of remaining reserves over the current
</p>
<p>rate of extraction. In its dynamic version, the change over time in both quantities is
</p>
<p>accounted for. Figure 6.3 shows the static range for conventional crude oil and
</p>
<p>natural gas reserves. It is roughly constant during the past decades, in spite of
</p>
<p>increasing extraction rates of oil and gas. This constancy corresponds quite well to
</p>
<p>the optimality of investment in exploration discussed above. Moreover, the static
</p>
<p>range of natural gas consistently exceeds that of crude oil. This can be attributed to
</p>
<p>the fact that large gas discoveries often occur as a byproduct of oil field exploration
</p>
<p>(so-called associated gas).
</p>
<p>However, the static range does not inform about how long the energy source will
</p>
<p>still be available. For one, reserves increase due to exploration and reclassification
</p>
<p>of reserves. The effective time to depletion can exceed the static range if the rate of
</p>
<p>annual extraction falls&mdash;and vice versa. Nonetheless, the static range is a helpful
</p>
<p>indicator of global reserves available. A decline in its value should be seen as
</p>
<p>indicating a need for increasing investment in exploration and efforts to substitute
</p>
<p>the resource by other (renewable) energy sources.

<p>6.2 Profit-Maximizing Resource Extraction
</p>
<p>In the same way that the transformation from resources to reserves is governed by
</p>
<p>economic considerations, the transformation of a reserve into money (i.e. extraction
</p>
<p>and sale) is an economic decision. It revolves around two alternatives:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Leave the reserve in the ground and wait for a higher market price (which is to be
</p>
<p>expected due to increased scarcity);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Extract the resource and invest the profit in securities or assets thereby earning
</p>
<p>the market interest rate.
</p>
<p>6.2.1 Hotelling Price Trajectory
</p>
<p>The Swedish economist Hotelling (1931) found a solution to the decision problem
</p>
<p>stated above, i.e. the profit-maximizing quantity of an exhaustible resource to be
</p>
<p>extracted during a given period. His model introduces several simplifying
</p>
<p>assumptions, notably competitive and efficient markets for resources, reserves,
</p>
<p>energy sources, and capital, profit-maximizing resource owners, perfect informa-
</p>
<p>tion regarding the amount of reserves, constant cost of mining and extraction, no
</p>
<p>inflation, no inventories after extraction, and an intertemporally stable demand
</p>
<p>function depending on the price of energy only. Given these assumptions, profit
</p>
<p>Πt in period t is given by
</p>
<p>Πt &frac14; ptRt � cRt: &eth;6:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here, Rt� 0 is the quantity extracted and sold in period t, pt the market price, and
c the marginal cost of extraction, which is assumed to be constant and hence equal
</p>
<p>to unit cost for simplicity.
</p>
<p>Postponing extraction is advantageous as long as (expected) profit in the follow-
</p>
<p>ing period Πt+1 exceeds profit achievable in the current period t, invested at the
</p>
<p>(real) rate of interest i,
</p>
<p>Πt&thorn;1 &frac14; pt&thorn;1Rt&thorn;1 � cRt&thorn;1 &gt; Πt 1&thorn; i&eth; &THORN;: &eth;6:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>In the opposite case, the firm extracts during the current period. If all extracting
</p>
<p>companies decide in this way, there will be an equilibrium market price pt,
</p>
<p>determined by their decisions in the aggregate, which has to satisfy the equality
</p>
<p>condition,
</p>
<p>Πt&thorn;1 &frac14; pt&thorn;1Rt&thorn;1 � cRt&thorn;1 &frac14; Πt 1&thorn; i&eth; &THORN;: &eth;6:5&THORN;
</p>
<p>Iterating this idea until the end of the planning horizon T&mdash;and assuming perfect
</p>
<p>foresight with respect to price&mdash;leads to the following decision problem of reserve-
</p>
<p>owners seeking to maximize the net present value NPV of their asset,

</p>
<p>The decision variables of each company are the extraction rates Rt during the
</p>
<p>planning period t&frac14; 1,. . ., T. However, their optimization is subject to the constraint
that the sum of extractions must not exceed total stock in the ground S. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, it would not make sense for the reserve-owner to leave anything in the ground
</p>
<p>beyond the planning period T so that the constraint becomes

</p>
<p>T
</p>
<p>t&frac14;0
</p>
<p>Rt &frac14; S: &eth;6:7&THORN;

</p>
<p>This expression states that if accumulated extractions were to exceed the
</p>
<p>existing stock S, the value of the objective function L would be reduced because
</p>
<p>of λ &gt; 0, causing the degree of goal attainment to fall. Therefore, one of the first-
order optimality condition reads

</p>
<p>T
</p>
<p>t&frac14;0
</p>
<p>Rt � S &frac14; 0: &eth;6:9&THORN;
</p>
<p>It guarantees that the constraint (6.7) is always satisfied in the optimum. The
</p>
<p>second optimality condition concerns the rate of extraction Rt during period t. Since
</p>
<p>the other extraction rates R0, . . ., Rt-1, Rt+1, . . .; RT are not affected by a decision in
</p>
<p>period t, one obtains
</p>
<p>&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;Rt
&frac14; pt � c&eth; &THORN; 1&thorn; i&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>�t � λ &frac14; 0: &eth;6:10&THORN;
</p>
<p>Solving this optimality condition yields the so-called Hotelling price trajectory,
</p>
<p>pt � c&eth; &THORN; &frac14; λ 1&thorn; i&eth; &THORN;
t
orpt &frac14; c&thorn; λ 1&thorn; i&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>t: &eth;6:11&THORN;
</p>
<p>Equation (6.11) can be interpreted as follows.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Marginal extraction cost c as lower limit on the price p: If the reserve were
</p>
<p>available in unlimited quantity, the constraint (6.7) would not be binding. From
</p>
<p>Eq. (6.8), one would obtain
</p>
<p>118 6 Energy Reserves and Sustainability</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&part;L
</p>
<p>&part;S
&frac14; λ: &eth;6:12&THORN;
</p>
<p>Therefore, the Lagrange multiplier reflects how much the objective function&mdash;
</p>
<p>the present value of profit in the present case&mdash;would increase if the constraint were
</p>
<p>to be reduced by one unit (or if the reserve initially were larger by one unit,
</p>
<p>respectively). However, if the reserve is unlimited, a further increase does not
</p>
<p>contribute to the value of the objective function, implying λ &frac14; 0. In this case, the
market price of the reserve is equal to the marginal cost of extraction, in keeping
</p>
<p>with Eq. (6.11). Thus, one obtains the classical rule, &ldquo;price equal marginal cost&rdquo;
</p>
<p>that characterizes competitive markets without exhaustible resources.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Surcharge on marginal cost, scarcity rent, user cost: The surcharge on the
</p>
<p>marginal cost of extraction depends on the value of the Lagrange multiplier λ.
</p>
<p>From the above interpretation of Eq. (6.12), one may infer that λ has a large
</p>
<p>value when the stock S is small and vice versa. Thus, the surcharge is high and
</p>
<p>increases fast when the reserve is small, causing λ to be large. Note that only the
</p>
<p>initial value of S is relevant for depletion along the Hotelling trajectory.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Price increase over time: Even given a constant marginal cost of extraction, the
</p>
<p>market price of the reserve increases over time. This can be seen by writing
</p>
<p>Eq. (6.11) for period t�1,
</p>
<p>pt�1 � c &frac14; λ 1&thorn; i&eth; &THORN;
t�1: &eth;6:13&THORN;
</p>
<p>Dividing (6.11) by (6.13), one obtains
</p>
<p>pt � c
</p>
<p>pt�1 � c
&frac14; 1&thorn; i or, after multiplying by pt�1 � c&eth; &THORN;,
</p>
<p>pt � pt�1
pt�1
</p>
<p>&frac14; i: &eth;6:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>Therefore, the (inflation-adjusted, real) price of the resource increases exponen-
</p>
<p>tially at a rate that equals the rate of interest on capital markets. This increase
</p>
<p>reflects the fact that the reserve becomes increasingly scarce as extraction
</p>
<p>continues, requiring its market price pt to go up relative to the prices of other
</p>
<p>goods and services.
</p>
<p>The difference pt�c is called scarcity rent (or user cost, respectively). It amounts
to the economic value of the reserve in the ground. If a company were to acquire the
</p>
<p>property right of a deposit, it would have to pay a price according to this user cost,
</p>
<p>provided markets for property rights are efficient.2 Indeed, the sum of so-called
</p>
<p>nonreproducible capital (i.e. the reserve in the ground) represents total fixed assets
</p>
<p>2In many countries exhaustible resources are considered public property, which hampers trade in
</p>
<p>deposits and causes pertinent markets to deviate from economic efficiency.

<p>of a resource-extracting company. In the optimum, both types of assets (reproduc-
</p>
<p>ible, nonreproducible) achieve the same rate of return.
</p>
<p>6.2.2 Role of Backstop Technologies
</p>
<p>No price can increase without limit. Sooner or later, the price of a reserve will attain
</p>
<p>psubst, at which some energy source becomes competitive as a substitute. Assuming
</p>
<p>that this alternative source can supply an amount sufficient to match demand at that
</p>
<p>price, the sales price of the reserve-extracting industry cannot exceed psubst because
</p>
<p>its product would not be competitive anymore. This alternative energy source is the
</p>
<p>so-called backstop technology that will substitute the reserve, at the latest once it is
</p>
<p>exhausted (and possibly sooner).
</p>
<p>This fact determines the optimum supply price in the current period, which can
</p>
<p>be shown as follows. If extracting companies are successful in maximizing net
</p>
<p>present value, the scarcity rent in the last period ( pT � c) must be equal to
( psubst � csubst). Discounting back to period t, one obtains
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>pt � c &frac14; pT � c&eth; &THORN; 1&thorn; i&eth; &THORN;
t�T &frac14; psubst � c&eth; &THORN; 1&thorn; i&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>t�T : &eth;6:15&THORN;
</p>
<p>More generally, the Hotelling price trajectory describes the stepwise transition
</p>
<p>from the least costly but scarce energy source to the next-best but more expensive
</p>
<p>substitute. This goes on until the most costly but unlimited backstop technology
</p>
<p>becomes competitive. In this process, the cheapest deposit is used up first, followed
</p>
<p>by a cascade of more costly deposits.
</p>
<p>One last property of the Hotelling trajectory is noteworthy. Figure 6.4 shows
</p>
<p>how&mdash;depending on the rate of interest&mdash;optimal paths of the reserve extraction
</p>
<p>and the associated prices may look like given the assumptions made above. In this
</p>
<p>example, the initial stock of reserves is S &frac14; 100 and the price of the backstop
technology, psubst &frac14; 80. In all trajectories, the price of the backstop is reached, but
the point in time depends on the rate of interest. At low interest rates, the optimal
</p>
<p>extraction period is long, the initial price of the reserve high, and the price increase
</p>
<p>over time relatively slow.
</p>
<p>The reason is that at a low rate of interest, the opportunity cost of foregoing
</p>
<p>interest income by leaving the resource in the ground rather than selling it is low,
</p>
<p>causing the optimal extraction period to be long. Conversely, at a high rate of
</p>
<p>interest, this opportunity cost is substantial, calling for timely extraction. At
</p>
<p>extremely high rates of interest, it is optimal to deplete the deposit as quickly as
</p>
<p>possible. In that case, the owner of the extraction right does not take scarcity rent
</p>
<p>3This is the typical approach for solving dynamic optimization problems: Calculation of the
</p>
<p>current optimal price is based on the optimal intertemporal price trajectory defined by the
</p>
<p>so-called transversality condition (6.14) which is a dynamic equation with at first unknown
</p>
<p>parameters. Based on the conditions for the final state, the optimal price given the parameter
</p>
<p>values can be determined, resulting from backward induction from future T to present t.

<p>into account. This causes the remaining period of utilization to fall&mdash;by as much as
</p>
<p>two decades in the example of Fig. 6.4.
</p>
<p>Another determinant of the optimal extraction period is the size of the cost
</p>
<p>advantage ( psubst &ndash; csubst), also called differential rent. To illustrate, let T* be the
</p>
<p>period in which ( psubst &ndash; csubst)&frac14; ( pT &ndash; c) exceeds 5% of marginal extraction cost c.
In view of Eq. (6.15), T* must satisfy the following condition,
</p>
<p>pT � c&eth; &THORN; 1&thorn; i&eth; &THORN;
�T* &frac14; 0:05 � cor

� ln20� lnc&thorn; ln pT � c&eth; &THORN;&eth; &THORN;:
</p>
<p>&eth;6:16&THORN;
</p>
<p>According to Eq. (6.16), T* does not depend on the stock of reserves S but on
</p>
<p>marginal extraction cost c, the cost advantage of the deposit, and the real interest
</p>
<p>rate i. The differential rent ( pT &ndash; c) is determined, among other things, by the
</p>
<p>(expected) backup cost csubst [see Eq. (6.16) again]. If research and development
</p>
<p>leads to a drop in this cost, the differential rent decreases, causing the present rate of
</p>
<p>extraction Rt to increase and the price of the reserve to fall. Thus, lower backup
</p>
<p>costs are beneficial to the users of the resource and society in general.
</p>
<p>However, the investment in backstop technology pays back only after T*, when
</p>
<p>it becomes competitive. Private investors will hardly undertake investments into
</p>
<p>research and development if T* is far off. Yet such investments generate a positive
</p>
<p>externality, which may provide a justification for their public (co-)financing (IEA
</p>
<p>2000).

<p>6.2.3 Role of Expectations and Expectation Errors
</p>
<p>One of the assumptions underlying the Hotelling price trajectory [defined by
</p>
<p>Eqs. (6.14) and (6.15)] is perfect foresight. However, parameters such as the size
</p>
<p>of deposits, their quality, the future cost of extraction, and future market prices are
</p>
<p>highly uncertain. One may use average expectations held by market participants to
</p>
<p>render the Hotelling trajectory applicable to the case of uncertainty (provided
</p>
<p>market participants are risk-neutral).
</p>
<p>However, expectations may turn out to be wrong. If a majority of market
</p>
<p>participants have to adjust their expectations, reserve quantities supplied and prices
</p>
<p>must adjust as well. Table 6.3 illustrates the case of two crude oil deposits with
</p>
<p>differing marginal cost of extraction. If the owner of the extraction right expects a
</p>
<p>price increase of 2 USD/bbl, the scarcity rent of the deposit increases by 6.7% for
</p>
<p>deposit A and 10% for deposit B, respectively. Assuming an interest rate of 8%,
</p>
<p>deposit A would be depleted, since its scarcity rent increases more slowly than the
</p>
<p>interest rate (0.067 &lt; 0.08). Deposit B would be preserved for later use
(0.10 &gt; 0.08). This corresponds to the general rule that low-cost deposits are
exploited first.
</p>
<p>Now let the expected price increase be 5 USD/bbl, causing the owner of the
</p>
<p>extraction right to expect an increase of the scarcity rent of 16.6% and 25%,
</p>
<p>respectively. In this case, it becomes optimal to defer extraction for both deposits.
</p>
<p>As a consequence, current market supply is reduced and price tends to increase.
</p>
<p>This example illustrates the phenomenon of self-fulfilling expectations. When
</p>
<p>the owners of extraction rights expect the price of their reserve to increase, they
</p>
<p>reduce the rate of extraction, thus reinforcing expectations. Since price expectations
</p>
<p>may change fast, for example due to revised estimates of reserves, resource markets
</p>
<p>are predicted to exhibit excessive price volatility. Indeed, the standard deviation of
</p>
<p>daily crude oil prices is high, amounting to some 30% according to Plourde and

</p>
<p>to apply appropriate strategies for hedging price risks.
</p>
<p>6.3 Optimal Resource Extraction: Social Welfare View
</p>
<p>The Hotelling price trajectory was derived from the profit-maximizing behavior of
</p>
<p>individual firms. This gives rise to the question of whether the outcome of individ-
</p>
<p>ual decisions coincides with the interest of society. The model presented below
</p>
<p>(following Dasgupta and Heal 1979) rests on several assumptions, such as constant
</p>
<p>population, fixed homogenous reserve stock S, and constant social rate of time
</p>
<p>preference r (see Sect. 3.4).
</p>
<p>Compared to the Hotelling formulation, the model is extended in two ways.
</p>
<p>First, the objective is not profit but utility derived from consumption of goods and
</p>
<p>services (the neoclassical definition of welfare). Second, the exhaustible reserve is
</p>
<p>not consumed directly but constitutes a factor of production that is used in the
</p>
<p>making of consumption goods. This second assumption is crucial because it opens
</p>
<p>up the possibility of substitution between exhaustible resources and reproducible
</p>
<p>capital, which can grow over time. In continuous time with an infinite time horizon,
</p>
<p>the objective function is the discounted sum of utilities W derived from consump-
</p>
<p>tion Ct (t &frac14; 0, 1, 2,. . .,1),
</p>
<p>W &frac14;
</p>
<p>Z 1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>U Ct&eth; &THORN;e
�rtdt: &eth;6:17&THORN;
</p>
<p>Using r to discount future utilities implies attributing reduced weight to the
</p>
<p>utility of future generations. This is a debatable assumption. However, without
</p>
<p>discounting, the infinite integral (6.17) would not converge toward a finite value.
</p>
<p>There are two constraints that must be observed. First, the stock of the reserve
</p>
<p>S is finite, causing the sum of extractions Rt � 0 to be limited,
</p>
<p>Z 1
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>Rt dt � S: &eth;6:18&THORN;
</p>
<p>Since it would not make economic sense to leave reserves in the ground at the
</p>
<p>end of an infinitely long planning horizon, this constraint becomes an equality.
</p>
<p>Moreover, (6.18) masks an equation of motion reflecting the effect of reserve
</p>
<p>extraction on the value of the remaining stock.4 This becomes evident when the
</p>
<p>remaining stock St is differentiated with respect to time t,
</p>
<p>4If the reserve is renewable as e.g. wood, a different formulation is appropriate: The decrease of
</p>
<p>reserve depends on extractions from and additions to the reserve through regeneration processes,
</p>
<p>which often are a function of the remaining stock.

<p>The second constraint relates consumption Ct to output Q. Output is given by a
</p>
<p>production function with capital Kt and currently extracted reserves Rt as its
</p>
<p>arguments. If the production function is independent of time (thus neglecting

</p>
<p>Net investment dKt/dt, depreciation δKt, and unit cost of extraction cRt must be
</p>
<p>deducted from output Q(Kt, Rt) to obtain the quantity available for consumption. In
</p>
<p>principle, the production function should also have labor as an argument (see Sect.
</p>
<p>5.3), but in view of the assumed constancy of population and technology (implying
</p>
<p>constant labor productivity), neglecting labor does not modify the core findings
</p>
<p>while simplifying the analysis.
</p>
<p>The objective function (6.17) cannot be analyzed using the methods of static
</p>
<p>optimization because the constraints, represented by the equations of motion, tie
</p>
<p>stock and flow variables together. This calls for dynamic optimization methods (see
</p>
<p>Dasgupta and Heal 1979; Chiang 1992). The point of departure is a generalized

<p>The first term is the original objective function. The second term takes the
</p>
<p>constraint (6.19) into account, using the Lagrange multiplier λt. This multiplier
</p>
<p>indicates the extent to which the value of the objective function would diminish if in
</p>
<p>period t one unit of the reserve were to be extracted in excess of the optimal change
</p>
<p>in the stock dSt/dt. Therefore, λt reflects the opportunity cost of the reserve, which
</p>
<p>changes over time (in contradistinction to the Hotelling formulation, where it is
</p>
<p>constant). The third term introduces the constraint on consumption, using the
</p>
<p>Lagrange multiplier ωt. This multiplier indicates the extent to which the value of
</p>
<p>the objective function would diminish if consumption in t were to grow in excess of
</p>
<p>optimal consumption. Therefore, ωt denotes the opportunity cost of consumption,
</p>
<p>which also may vary over time.5
</p>
<p>In the language of dynamic optimization theory, the Lagrange function has two
</p>
<p>state variables, Kt and St and two control variables, Ct and Rt. As the model has an
</p>
<p>infinite time horizon, no conditions concerning the final state need to be imposed.

<p>The first condition thus states that the marginal value of consumption must

</p>
<p>that additional extraction Rt of the resource has two effects that must balance in the

<p>optimum. The first effect is a reduction in the reserve remaining which is valued

<p>using the opportunity cost of the reserve λc,t. The other effect is the extra production

<p>opportunity cost of consumption ωc,t.
</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian function needs to be differentiated also with respect to the two

</p>
<p>ered as indirect decision variables because they are linked to Rt and Ct through

<p>Eqs. (6.20) and (6.21), respectively. Moreover, they affect their pertinent Lagrange

<p>simplifying assumption that any extra investment and hence acceleration in the

<p>i (which holds if capital markets are perfect), the Hotelling rule coincides with the

<p>productivity of capital QK is equal to or exceeds the social rate of time preference r.
</p>
<p>Given a production function Q(�) without technological change, the marginal
product of reproducible capital must decrease when capital stock K grows. This is
</p>
<p>the law of diminishing marginal returns, which holds when one or more of the other
</p>
<p>inputs are held constant. In the present case, the other input is the non-renewable
</p>
<p>resource which is not only held constant but even tends to decline over time.
</p>
<p>Therefore QK &lt; r holds sooner or later, suggesting that consumption C must
decrease in the long run. However, a long-run fall in consumption is not only due
</p>
<p>to the depletion of reserves but also to the discounting of future utilities with r � 0.
In Sect. 6.4.2 below, it is shown that a different formulation of the objective
</p>
<p>function permits, under certain conditions, a non-declining level of consumption
</p>
<p>in the long run.
</p>
<p>Another element of the Ramsey consumption rule concerns η, the elasticity of
</p>
<p>the marginal utility of consumption with respect to consumption. This parameter
</p>
<p>determines the optimal speed of adjustment. Consider a reduction of consumption:
</p>
<p>Given usual assumptions, this causes the marginal utility of consumption to
</p>
<p>increase. If the value of η is large, this marginal utility increases fast (the utility
</p>
<p>function is strongly convex from below), indicating a high loss of utility if con-
</p>
<p>sumption is to fall. According to Eq. (6.34), optimal adjustment should be slow in
</p>
<p>this case. Conversely, if η is small, the utility function is almost linear; therefore, a
</p>
<p>fall in consumption causes a small loss of utility, indicating that optimal adjustment
</p>
<p>can be fast.

</p>
<p>&ndash; The marginal utility of consumption;
</p>
<p>&ndash; The marginal productivity of the reserve.
</p>
<p>According to the Hotelling rule, the rate of change in λc needs to be equal to the
</p>
<p>social rate of time preference r for overall optimality, implying (dλ/dt)/λ &frac14; r.
Moreover, Eq. (6.28) can be divided by the opportunity cost of consumption ωc
to obtain dωc/ωc &frac14; r &ndash; Qk. Substitution of these expressions into the left-hand and

<p>Optimally, the marginal product of the exhaustible resource QR must therefore
</p>
<p>increase at a rate equal to the marginal product of capital QK. In the absence of
</p>
<p>technological change, the marginal product of a production factor can only be
</p>
<p>increased by using less of it (law of diminishing marginal returns). Thus, the
</p>
<p>increase of the marginal product of the resource over time implies a diminishing
</p>
<p>rate of extraction.
</p>
<p>6.3.3 Causes and Implications of Market Failure
</p>
<p>Given equality of the social rate of time preference and the market rate of interest,
</p>
<p>society&rsquo;s welfare is maximized if the Hotelling rule is satisfied. Therefore, it would
</p>
<p>be beneficial for this rule to govern resource markets. As shown in Sect. 6.2, this
</p>
<p>would also be the optimal solution for reserve-extracting firms, at least under
</p>
<p>idealistic assumptions such as perfect information and atomistic competition. Yet
</p>
<p>the reality of resource markets is usually far from satisfying these assumptions.
</p>
<p>Besides discrepancies between the rate of social time preference and the market rate
</p>
<p>of interest caused by capital market imperfections, variations in the cost and quality
</p>
<p>of reserve deposits, and the presence of external costs, there are three problems that
</p>
<p>are of particular relevance in the context of exhaustible energy sources.
</p>
<p>1. Suboptimal extraction capacity: For the Hotelling rule to hold, the rate of
</p>
<p>extraction Rt needs to be sufficiently flexible. However, geological conditions,
</p>
<p>limited extraction capacities and bottlenecks in logistics can cause Rt to fall short
</p>
<p>of the value required by the Hotelling rule. To keep extraction (and with it,
</p>
<p>production) on the optimal trajectory, additional investment in resource extrac-
</p>
<p>tion is needed as a rule, which however may create excess capacities given that
</p>
<p>Rt is to decline in the near future. Anticipating this, companies tend to
</p>
<p>underinvest in extraction relative to the level that would be necessary to satisfy
</p>
<p>the Hotelling rule.
</p>
<p>The decision concerning investment in extraction capacity is based on a
</p>
<p>calculation at the margin. If extraction capacity falls short of the value required
</p>
<p>by the Hotelling rule, society suffers economic losses. Yet, a capacity expansion
</p>
<p>according to this rule may also cause losses due to future underuse of this
</p>
<p>capacity. In the optimum, the two losses must be equal. As long as capacity is
</p>
<p>below its Hotelling value, extraction occurs at the rate compatible with maxi-
</p>
<p>mum capacity utilization. This causes the price of the resource to be in excess of
</p>
<p>the Hotelling price path, with the discrepancy indicating the opportunity cost of
</p>
<p>the capacity bottleneck. However, this discrepancy decreases over time since
</p>
<p>depletion of the reserve drives the resource price up and the extraction rate down
</p>
<p>until the bottleneck no longer exists. The market price then catches up with the
</p>
<p>Hotelling price path, as shown on the left-hand side of Fig. 6.5 (note that the
</p>
<p>abscissa is not time but cumulated extraction). Thus, the deviation from the
</p>
<p>optimal trajectory is transitory rather than permanent in this case.
</p>
<p>6.3 Optimal Resource Extraction: Social Welfare View 129</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2. Exercise of market power by cartels and monopolies: Market power also causes
</p>
<p>a deviation from the Hotelling price path. To the extent that owners of extraction
</p>
<p>rights succeed in imposing a price in excess of the competitive level, demand for
</p>
<p>the resource falls short of the volume predicated by the Hotelling path. This
</p>
<p>causes depletion to be slower than under competitive conditions. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>scarcity rent λc is lower than in the competitive case (see the right-hand side of
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.5), again noting that the abscissa shows cumulated extraction). However,
</p>
<p>due to the monopoly, the market price of the resource is higher than given
</p>
<p>competition.
</p>
<p>On the one hand, one may hail the slowing of reserve depletion and the
</p>
<p>concomitant mitigation of environmental effects (&ldquo;the monopolist is the
</p>
<p>environment&rsquo;s best friend&rdquo;). On the other hand, society&rsquo;s welfare suffers (unam-
</p>
<p>biguously in the absence of external costs) because of the higher resource price
</p>
<p>and the associated loss of consumer surplus. This time, violation of the Hotelling
</p>
<p>rule continues as long as prices are affected by monopoly power.
</p>
<p>3. Market rate of interest higher than the social rate of time preference (i &gt; r): A
discrepancy of this type may be due to capital market imperfections. A high
</p>
<p>interest rate implies a high extraction rate, causing time to depletion to be
</p>
<p>shortened. The rate of interest may be high because financiers demand a sur-
</p>
<p>charge for the risks associated with exploration, which they tend to overestimate
</p>
<p>due to information asymmetries. Another reason are poorly defined property
</p>
<p>rights. This may occur if several firms extract from the same deposit while
</p>
<p>reserves are geologically mobile, as is the case with conventional crude oil and
</p>
<p>natural gas fields. This creates an incentive for each company to extract as much
</p>
<p>of the resource as possible, to the detriment of its competitors (this is known as
</p>
<p>the common pool problem). An excessive rate of extraction is also to be
</p>
<p>expected if companies fear expropriation of their rights (through so-called
</p>
<p>nationalization). Finally, excess extraction can occur in situations where the

<p>holders of the rights (who decide about the extraction rate) are distinct from the
</p>
<p>owners of the reserve (who claim the scarcity rent). In this case, the scarcity rent
</p>
<p>fails to provide an economic signal concerning the rate of extraction, which is
</p>
<p>necessary for the Hotelling price rule to work.
</p>
<p>6.4 Sustainability
</p>
<p>The sustainability concept originated in forestry, meaning that the use of timber
</p>
<p>corresponds to the maximum harvest that is compatible with a constant stock of
</p>
<p>trees. However, contrary to the timber industry, energy sources such as crude oil,
</p>
<p>natural gas, coal, and uranium are not renewable. The sustainability concept thus
</p>
<p>cannot be applied without modification to non-renewable energy sources since the
</p>
<p>stock of the reserves is constant only when extraction is abandoned altogether.
</p>
<p>A definition of sustainability that is more suitable to non-renewable energy
</p>
<p>sources has been proposed by the Brundtland report. According to that report,
</p>
<p>any development is sustainable &ldquo;(. . .) that meets the needs of the present without
</p>
<p>compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&rdquo; (WCED
</p>
<p>1987, p. 43). Accordingly, a decreasing stock of non-renewable energy sources is
</p>
<p>admissible as long as the needs of future generations can be met with a reduced
</p>
<p>availability or even lack of non-renewable energy. This definition is called weak
</p>
<p>sustainability in distinction to strong sustainability, which calls for always keeping
</p>
<p>a minimum stock of reserves in favor of future generations.
</p>
<p>6.4.1 Potential of Renewable Energy Sources
</p>
<p>Weak sustainability is only conceivable if there is a sufficient potential of renew-
</p>
<p>able energy sources globally, amounting to multiples of present global use of
</p>
<p>primary energy. In fact, the potential of renewable energy sources such as hydro-
</p>
<p>power, solar radiation, wind, biomass, ocean energy, and geothermal energy is
</p>
<p>abundant. The energy of solar radiation hitting the outer atmosphere amounts to
</p>
<p>0.14 W/cm2 (the so-called solar constant). The insolated surface of the Earth is
</p>
<p>given by
</p>
<p>63662 π km2
� �
</p>
<p>&frac14; 1273� 1015 cm2
� �
</p>
<p>&eth;6:39&THORN;
</p>
<p>This corresponds to an energy inflow of 178,000 TWa, of which the continents
</p>
<p>receive 25,000 TWa. Some 6% of total radiation energy hits deserts and wastelands
</p>
<p>that have no alternate land use. If that solar energy could be transformed into usable
</p>
<p>energy with an energy efficiency of only 10%, the world would dispose of
</p>
<p>37.5 TWa or 28 bn toe, respectively (the technical potential), which is a multiple
</p>
<p>of today&rsquo;s global energy consumption of about 12.7 bn toe (see Table 2.5).
</p>
<p>6.4 Sustainability 131</p>
<p/>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Therefore, if used to its potential, solar radiation alone would be sufficient to
</p>
<p>fully eliminate the use of non-renewable energy sources worldwide (see Table 6.4).
</p>
<p>Additional potential energy sources come from wind, biomass, and possibly nuclear
</p>
<p>fusion. The technologies required for their use are known in principle.
</p>
<p>Non-renewable energy sources are thus entirely substitutable as long as there are
</p>
<p>no other, non-energetic constraints (such as scarcity of precious metals and rare
</p>
<p>earths as necessary inputs), and as long as harvest rates (see Sect. 2.4) in excess of
</p>
<p>1 can be attained.
</p>
<p>The limited use of renewable energies is mainly due to their still rather high cost,
</p>
<p>which in turn is caused by their low energy density (defined as energy flow per m2
</p>
<p>surface or m3 volume). Therefore capacities for collecting renewable energy
</p>
<p>require relatively high volumes of material and capital. A second cause, related in
</p>
<p>particular to solar, wind, and tidal energy, is their discontinuous availability that
</p>
<p>usually implies low rates of capacity utilization and a backup system in the case of
</p>
<p>renewable electricity (see Sect. 12.2). Yet, there have been substantial preindustrial
</p>
<p>uses of renewable energy sources such as biomass and hydropower, benefiting from
</p>
<p>the fact that nature offers collectors for free in the guise of woody plants and rivers.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, harvesting these sources of energy is relatively cheap. Indeed, bio-
</p>
<p>mass and hydropower continue to constitute the most important renewable sources
</p>
<p>of the global energy system.
</p>
<p>6.4.2 Hartwick Rule for Weak Sustainability
</p>
<p>As shown in Sect. 6.3, the Hotelling rule implies a price signal that incentivizes the
</p>
<p>efficient extraction and use of non-renewable reserves. However, the corresponding
</p>
<p>Ramsey consumption trajectory [see Eq. (6.34)] does not ensure an increasing or at
</p>
<p>least non-declining level of consumption over time. Indeed, future generations
</p>
<p>could be confronted with a drop in their consumption possibilities, violating the
</p>
<p>criterion of weak sustainability (see Fig. 6.6).

<p>Going beyond neoclassical welfare optimization, economist Solow (1986)
</p>
<p>introduced the postulate that per-capita consumption must not decrease, in keeping
</p>
<p>with weak sustainability. Given a constant population, the Solow postulate reads
</p>
<p>dCt
</p>
<p>dt
� 0 for all t: &eth;6:40&THORN;
</p>
<p>Loosely speaking, this guarantees that the welfare of future generations is at least
</p>
<p>as high as that of the present generation. Additional consumption by the present
</p>
<p>generation is admissible only if all future generations can attain at least the same or
</p>
<p>a higher level of consumption. This defines the so-called Hartwick consumption
</p>
<p>trajectory (Hartwick 1977, see Fig. 6.6). It is derived as follows.
</p>
<p>In order to have a positive rate of consumption in spite of exhaustible energy
</p>
<p>sources such as crude oil and natural gas, it must be possible to substitute these
</p>
<p>sources completely with renewables at some future time. For achieving this,
</p>
<p>resource input R needs to be replaced by reproducible (also called manmade)
</p>
<p>capital K. An example of complete substitution are plants for hydrogen electrolysis
</p>
<p>that produce alternative fuels using wind power and photovoltaics. If complete
</p>
<p>substitution of this type can be attained, a positive amount of consumption should in
</p>
<p>principle be possible in all future periods.
</p>
<p>Whether or not the current level of consumption (per capita) is sustainable in the
</p>
<p>future crucially depends on the answers to two questions:
</p>
<p>&ndash; How easily can non-renewable reserves be substituted with reproducible capital?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Is the current generation willing to finance the necessary growth of reproducible
</p>
<p>capital by partly renouncing to current consumption?
</p>
<p>The first question refers to the elasticity of substitution σRK between the
</p>
<p>exhaustible resource R and reproducible capital K. As explained in Sect. 5.3.3,
</p>
<p>the elasticity of substitution indicates how much the cost-minimizing mix of factor
</p>
<p>inputs (in the present case R and K ) adjusts to a change of relative factor prices (unit
</p>
<p>price of the resource pR and cost of capital pK) given that output is to be kept

</p>
<p>Here, σRK� 1 indicates easy substitutability; if σRK&lt; 1, the exhaustible resource
and capital are not easily substitutable. In that case, the predicted increase of pR
(relative to pK) requires a disproportionately high increase of capital in order to
</p>
<p>keep the level of production (and with it, consumption) constant, presumably
</p>
<p>rendering complete substitution impossible.
</p>
<p>Assuming σRK � 1, thus substitutability between reserves R and capital K, the
second question has still to be addressed. Here, the Hartwick rule states that weak
</p>
<p>sustainability (dC/dt &frac14; 0) is achievable provided the scarcity rent associated with
the resource is entirely invested in reproducible capital. The scarcity rent is given
</p>
<p>by ( pR &ndash; c)·R, i.e. the excess of the resource price over the unit extraction cost
</p>
<p>multiplied by the quantity of the resource used in production. Thus the Hartwick

<p>rule can be written

<p>:
&eth;6:42&THORN;
</p>
<p>The proof that this rule ensures weak sustainability given σRK � 1 proceeds as
follows. First, the production functionQt&frac14;Q(Kt, Rt) is differentiated with respect to

<p>At this point, the Hotelling price path is invoked. It states that the scarcity rent
</p>
<p>(QR &ndash; c) per unit resource must grow in step with the real rate of interest, which in
</p>
<p>turn equals the marginal productivity of capital [see Eq. (6.25)]. Therefore, one has

</p>
<p>The second equality sign takes into account that dc/dt &frac14; 0 since unit extraction
cost is constant by assumption (for a relaxation of assumptions in several
</p>
<p>dimensions as well as a critical interpretation of the Hartwick rule, see Mitra
</p>
<p>et al. 2013). Substitution of Eq. (6.46) into Eq. (6.43) yields

</p>
<p>To show sufficiency for achieving a non-declining consumption path dC/dt �
0, the Hartwick rule is assumed to be satisfied.6 This means that Eq. (6.42) can be
</p>
<p>used to replace dK/dt in Eq. (6.47), resulting in

</p>
<p>Provided the Hartwick rule holds, the change of aggregate production can thus
</p>
<p>be reduced to the sum of two terms:
</p>
<p>&ndash; The change in the marginal productivity of the resource, weighted by the
</p>
<p>quantity of the resource;
</p>
<p>&ndash; The change in resource use, weighted by its marginal productivity.
</p>
<p>Equation (6.48) is the result of the differentiation of a product. Therefore, one

<p>has

<p>Finally, solving eq. (6.45) for dC/dt using (6.49) and rearranging terms results in

</p>
<p>if the amount of capital depreciation δK is a constant. The last equality sign uses
</p>
<p>the differentiated form of the Hartwick rule (6.42). As a consequence, consumption
</p>
<p>remains constant over time (dC/dt&frac14; 0) as long as this rule is satisfied. If the present
generation complies with it, future generations will be able to enjoy the same level
</p>
<p>of consumption as today&rsquo;s population.
</p>
<p>However, the question remains whether this steady consumption level is strictly
</p>
<p>positive (C &gt; 0) or not. Solow (1974) provided an answer using the Cobb-Douglas
production function
</p>
<p>Q &frac14; αKβ Rγ with α, β, γ &gt; 0: &eth;6:51&THORN;
</p>
<p>According to Solow, maximum possible consumption in this case is given by7

</p>
<p>0 with initial values K0 and S0: &eth;6:52&THORN;
</p>
<p>Eq. (6.52) shows that a sustainable positive consumption level Cmax&gt; 0 requires
two conditions to be simultaneously satisfied.
</p>
<p>&ndash; c&lt; 1: The marginal cost of extraction must not exceed the marginal productivity
of the resource; otherwise, the reserve S0 would lower output to begin with,
</p>
<p>causing the buildup of capital to be counter-productive (this is intuitive because
</p>
<p>the two factors of production are used in combination).
</p>
<p>&ndash; β &gt; γ: The elasticity of output with respect to the capital input must exceed the
elasticity of output with respect to the resource input (which is intuitive, too).
</p>
<p>The Cobb-Douglas production function is characterized by a unitary elasticity of
</p>
<p>substitution between the two inputs (σRK &frac14; 1). If σRK &gt; 1, a higher level of
consumption than the one determined by Eq. (6.52) can be sustained, whereas if
</p>
<p>σRK &lt; 1, a positive level of consumption is impossible in the long run because
production without any use of the exhaustible resource cannot be attained.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.7 illustrates the two cases. In the left-hand panel, a production function
</p>
<p>with an elasticity of substitution σRK &frac14; 0.75 is shown. No output is possible given
R &frac14; 0 (at point A0, for example). The right-hand panel shows a production function
</p>
<p>7Given a constant rate of social time preference r, this (flat) consumption path is not optimal in the
</p>
<p>sense of the objective function (6.17) of Sect. 6.3. However, it can be shown that if r decreases over
</p>
<p>time according to rt&frac14; (1&thorn;a�t)
-b with a, b&gt; 0, then the sustainable level of consumption according
</p>
<p>to Eq. (6.52) is also optimal.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>with σRK &frac14; 3. Here, positive output (Q &gt; 0) is feasible given R &frac14; 0 (at point A1, for
example).
</p>
<p>Evidently, the elasticity of substitution is crucial for weak sustainability. Yet it is
</p>
<p>a local property of the production function and may change its value when inputs of
</p>
<p>capital Kt and reserves Rt vary in the course of time t. Indeed, the increasing scarcity
</p>
<p>of the exhaustible resource causes the two inputs to change over time. Weak
</p>
<p>sustainability requires that the average value of the substitution elasticity along
</p>
<p>its trajectory {σRK,t, t&frac14;t0, t1,. . . } is larger or equal to one, permitting the
non-renewable resource to be completely substituted by reproducible capital.
</p>
<p>The fact that the elasticity of substitution is a local property of the production
</p>
<p>function has important implications. This can best be explained using the example
</p>
<p>of wind power, which constitutes an option for replacing fossil fuels. With existing
</p>
<p>technologies, wind power can already today replace some fossil fuels.8 However,
</p>
<p>the best sites for wind generation are the first to be occupied, leaving inferior sites
</p>
<p>for additional investment designed to substitute fossil fuels. Without technological
</p>
<p>change, future substitution may therefore become more difficult (σRK decreases). In
</p>
<p>this case, the expansion of wind power generation may bind a great deal of capital
</p>
<p>in the long run, leaving less production output for consumption. This may jeopar-
</p>
<p>dize the weak sustainability condition dC/dt � 0 even though substitutability
between fossil fuels and wind power obtains at present.
</p>
<p>6.4.3 Population Growth and Technological Change
</p>
<p>Section 6.4.2 defines weak sustainability to mean non-decreasing per-capita con-
</p>
<p>sumption. Given a production function without technological change and an elas-
</p>
<p>ticity of substitution σRK &frac14; 1, this condition can only be satisfied if population does

<p>not grow. However, even with a growing population weak sustainability can be
</p>
<p>attained if&mdash;in addition to stocking up reproducible capital according to the
</p>
<p>Hartwick rule&mdash;factor productivities increase faster than population due to
</p>
<p>increased know-how and technological change.
</p>
<p>Focusing on the latter, the simplest modeling approach is to view technological
</p>
<p>changes as exogenous and to incorporate it in the Cobb-Douglas production func-
</p>
<p>tion (6.51) (see Stiglitz 1974),
</p>
<p>Qt &frac14; α � K

</p>
<p>f t with parameters α, β, γ, f &gt; 0: &eth;6:53&THORN;
</p>
<p>If the rate of technological change f exceeds the rate of population growth,
</p>
<p>satisfaction of the Hartwick rule ensures weak sustainability, i.e. non-decreasing
</p>
<p>per-capita consumption.
</p>
<p>The weakness of this approach is that it takes technological change as exoge-
</p>
<p>nous. In reality, it is endogenous, driven by (costly) investment in research and
</p>
<p>development. The many alternatives of modeling this endogeneity cannot be
</p>
<p>discussed here (see Stoneman 1983 for a survey). Suffice it to remark that &lsquo;knowl-
</p>
<p>edge&rsquo; (the stock of know-how and human capital) could be introduced as a factor of
</p>
<p>production of its own. Its special feature is that it does not decrease but rather
</p>
<p>increases thanks to learning by doing, contrary to natural resources (through
</p>
<p>extraction) and reproducible capital (through depreciation). Moreover, its rate of
</p>
<p>increase depends positively on the amount of know-how already accumulated.
</p>
<p>Following up on this idea, total capital stock can be viewed as consisting of
</p>
<p>reserves of exhaustible resources, reproducible capital, and human capital. In
</p>
<p>keeping with the Hartwick rule, the scarcity rent derived from resource extraction
</p>
<p>must entirely be invested in reproducible capital. However, growth in knowledge
</p>
<p>and know-how in excess of population growth permits to increase the rate of
</p>
<p>production and consumption per capita. Thereby future generations can attain a
</p>
<p>higher per-capita consumption level than present generations in spite of an increas-
</p>
<p>ing scarcity of exhaustible resources.
</p>
<p>6.4.4 Is the Hartwick Rule Satisfied?
</p>
<p>The Hartwick rule for weak sustainability demands that the scarcity rent from
</p>
<p>mining and extracting exhaustible resources be entirely invested as reproducible
</p>
<p>capital rather than used for consumption purposes. This requirement motivated the
</p>
<p>countries bordering on the North Sea to abstain from paying the revenues from their
</p>
<p>oil and gas fields into their social security schemes (i.e. for current consumption)
</p>
<p>but to rather devote them to investment.
</p>
<p>Pearce and Atkinson (1998) checked the extent to which the Hartwick rule may
</p>
<p>be satisfied by resource-extracting countries. The authors define the total stock of
</p>
<p>capital as the sum of reserves of natural resources and reproducible capital. For this
</p>
<p>total stock not to decrease, aggregate savings must exceed net revenue from
</p>
<p>resource extraction (pR &ndash; c)�R plus depreciation of reproducible capital δK,

<p>Savings � pR � c&eth; &THORN;R&thorn; δK: &eth;6:54&THORN;
</p>
<p>Countries with a high rate of savings9 and little reserve extraction&mdash;among them
</p>
<p>Japan and many countries of Western Europe&mdash;turn out to be on the path of (weak)
</p>
<p>sustainability, at least during the observation period. Brazil, Indonesia, the United
</p>
<p>Kingdom, and the United States are borderline cases because their rate of savings
</p>
<p>(which is relatively low) combines with a good deal of reserve extraction. However,
</p>
<p>the African countries sampled fail to satisfy the Hartwick rule. Yet Proops et al.
</p>
<p>(1999) showed that this assessment changes drastically as soon as international
</p>
<p>trade in resources is accounted for. In particular, oil-exporting as well as
</p>
<p>oil-importing countries were found to live off their future generations. By way of
</p>
<p>contrast, Weitzman (1997) estimated the United States to be in accord with the rule;
</p>
<p>due to technological change, its future production and consumption possibilities
</p>
<p>increase much faster than they diminish due to resource extraction.
</p>
<p>Political implementation of the Hartwick rule is an issue of its own. Norway is
</p>
<p>one of the first countries to follow it. Aware of the fact that the country&rsquo;s oil and gas
</p>
<p>reserves in the North Sea are limited, the Norwegian government began in 1990 to
</p>
<p>transfer its revenues from oil and gas sales to the Norwegian Government Pension
</p>
<p>Fund, which is not part of the public budget but is administered by the Norwegian
</p>
<p>Central Bank. The assets of the Fund, being invested on the international capital
</p>
<p>market, are exposed to the volatility of stock prices. Their use is decided by the
</p>
<p>Norwegian parliament, who has credited only the returns (adjusted for inflation) to
</p>
<p>the public purse until today, leaving the principal intact. With roughly 130 bn EUR
</p>
<p>at the end of 2004 and 600 bn EUR by the end of 2014, the Fund is one of the largest
</p>
<p>sovereign wealth funds worldwide. While its later use is not decided yet, the
</p>
<p>Hartwick rule suggests long-term investments in the development of alternative
</p>
<p>energy sources, infrastructure, education, and research. However, in view of fast
</p>
<p>growth of its assets, there is considerable political pressure to use it for consumption
</p>
<p>purposes as well.
</p>
<p>The Norwegian Fund is designed not only to implement the Hartwick rule but
</p>
<p>also to insulate the public budget from the volatilities of oil and gas prices, and to
</p>
<p>protect the economy from the so-called Dutch disease. The Dutch disease is a
</p>
<p>scenario which can occur in small countries with an important resource extraction
</p>
<p>sector. The large-scale expansion of this sector generates important export revenues
</p>
<p>which usually are exchanged in domestic currency. This demand drives up the
</p>
<p>domestic currency, causing domestic goods to become expensive compared to
</p>
<p>foreign goods. As a consequence, the country&rsquo;s international competitiveness
</p>
<p>suffers, hampering its exports of other goods and services (e.g. by fisheries in the
</p>
<p>case of Norway).10
</p>
<p>9Macroeconomic savings divided by the Gross Domestic Product.
10This phenomenon was first observed in The Netherlands at the beginning of an export boom at
</p>
<p>the beginning of the 1970s, hence its name &lsquo;Dutch disease&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>6.4 Sustainability 139</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indeed, large oil and gas deposits may turn out to be a curse rather than a blessing
</p>
<p>for many economies. Norway is one of the few energy-exporting countries to have
</p>
<p>clearly benefited up to now, motivating several oil-exporting countries to copy
</p>
<p>Norway by creating similar sovereign wealth funds.
</p>
<p>Yet the accumulation of the scarcity rents derived from the extraction of oil and
</p>
<p>gas can pose another problem if it results in high amounts relative to global capital
</p>
<p>markets. According to the Hotelling price trajectory, scarcity rents grow over time,
</p>
<p>while according to the Hartwick rule, they need to be invested rather than con-
</p>
<p>sumed. However, do global capital markets offer sufficient investment
</p>
<p>opportunities? What happens to the (real) interest rate when the supply of capital
</p>
<p>continues to increase? What if the funds are invested in financial instruments only,
</p>
<p>in response to a lack of productive investment opportunities? Is the global financial
</p>
<p>system stable at all? Indeed, international capital markets may not be capable of
</p>
<p>accommodating the global inflow of scarcity rents which has surpassed 1000 bn
</p>
<p>USD annually, equivalent to 2% of the world&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product. In
</p>
<p>addition, concentration of these funds in the hands of a few oil-exporting countries
</p>
<p>poses a particular risk to the countries hosting this foreign investment.

</p>
<p>energy. Concepts have been developed in environmental economics for solving the
</p>
<p>associated problems in an economically efficient way. They revolve around the
</p>
<p>terms externality, external cost, and avoidance cost (also called abatement cost).
</p>
<p>Provided damages and risks can be quantified and monetized, internalization
</p>
<p>strategies are available which shift external costs back to the consumers of energy
</p>
<p>in the guise of higher energy prices. Market participants are made to extend their
</p>
<p>avoidance effort to the point where the marginal abatement cost equals marginal
</p>
<p>damage cost avoided. This is the social optimum.
</p>
<p>While these lines of thought look conceptually simple enough, there are several
</p>
<p>issues that need to be addressed:
</p>
<p>&ndash; How can externalities be linked to specific emissions?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How are they to be quantified and expressed in money as to become external
</p>
<p>costs?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Frequently, marginal external cost avoided cannot be easily measured, as e.g. in
</p>
<p>the case of improved air quality. How is one to proceed for determining the
</p>
<p>optimum?
</p>
<p>&ndash; An economic expression of the marginal benefit of avoidance is (marginal)
</p>
<p>willingness to pay of those affected by the externality. Are there ways to
</p>
<p>measure this?
</p>
<p>&ndash; So-called market experiments have become popular for estimating willingness
</p>
<p>to pay. How can they be performed? What are their limitations?
</p>
<p>&ndash; The so-called standard-price constitutes an alternative. In what circumstances is
</p>
<p>it to be recommended?

<p>7.1 The Coase Theorem
</p>
<p>Before presenting the Coase theorem, several terms need to be defined first.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Emissions: Impacts on the environment emanating from facilities, such as noise,
</p>
<p>tremor, odor, contamination, and radiation through air, water, and soil;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Immissions: Concentration of emissions in the environment;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Damages: Impacts of immissions on health, matter, environment and other
</p>
<p>aspects for the quality of life that are negatively valued by humans;
</p>
<p>&ndash; External effects (also called externalities): Negative or positive impacts of an
</p>
<p>activity performed by an economic agent on other agents without compensation;
</p>
<p>&ndash; External cost: Negative external effects valued in money.
</p>
<p>For an exposition of basic principles, the analysis is first limited to two agents, for
</p>
<p>example a company operating a plant and the owner of a home in the plant&rsquo;s vicinity.
</p>
<p>Let emissions from the plant cause a loss of value to the property. The situation can be
</p>
<p>characterized by the profit function of the companyΠ &frac14; Π(Em) and the external cost
function Cext &frac14; Cext(Em). Both are a function of emissions Em, which are assumed to
vary in proportion with the amount of goods and services produced by the company.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, nothing is produced at the emissions level Em&frac14; 0, resulting in external
cost Cext &frac14; 0. In addition, marginal profit Π&rsquo; is assumed to decrease with production
and hence volume of emissions, such that profit reaches itsmaximumatEm0, as shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 7.1. Marginal external cost Cext&rsquo; is assumed to increase with Em.
</p>
<p>If permitted to neglect external cost, the company chooses output and hence
</p>
<p>emissions in a way as to maximize its profit Π. Emissions therefore will amount to
</p>
<p>Em0. Given external marginal cost as depicted in Fig. 7.1, the volume of production
</p>
<p>targeted by the company is not Pareto-optimal. If the plant were to decrease its
</p>
<p>production, the loss in terms of profit would be less than the benefit in terms of external
</p>
<p>cost avoided. The injured party (i.e. the homeowner) could offer to compensate the
</p>
<p>company for its profit foregone in return for a reduction in its emission and hence
</p>
<p>damage caused. Note however that generally the welfare-optimal emission level is not
</p>
<p>Em &frac14; 0, in contradistinction of what is usually suggested in the political debate.

<p>144 7 External Costs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This line of thought leads to the so-called Coase theorem (Coase 1960). It is
</p>
<p>based on the idea that rights to the environment can be allocated to the polluter or
</p>
<p>the damaged party in the guise of property rights. In the first case, the polluter has
</p>
<p>the right to cause an external effect. In the second case, the injured party has the
</p>
<p>right to live in an emission-free environment. Both parties (the company as the
</p>
<p>polluter and the homeowner as the injured party) could initiate negotiations. These
</p>
<p>negotiations would proceed depending on the initial allocation of the property right
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 7.2, which differs from Fig. 7.1 because the company&rsquo;s marginal profit is
</p>
<p>positive already at Em &frac14; 0; also note the transition from total to marginal
quantities).
</p>
<p>&ndash; The injured party owns the property right: The company cannot start production
</p>
<p>without the consent of the homeowner. Prior to negotiations, the point of
</p>
<p>departure is Em&frac14; 0. However, the parties should be able to agree on an emission
level Em &gt; 0 because the company could use part of the additional profit to
</p>
<p>compensate the homeowner for the negative externality suffered. The result of
</p>
<p>this negotiation would be an improvement for the company without deterioration
</p>
<p>for the homeowner. Negotiations would continue until marginal profit Π&rsquo;
</p>
<p>coincides with external marginal cost Cext
0 at Em*.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The polluter owns the property right: In this case, the point of departure is the
</p>
<p>level of emissions Em0 that maximizes the company&rsquo;s profit. However, the

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>company should be willing to reduce its output and hence emissions if the
</p>
<p>injured party accepts to compensate it for the loss of profit incurred. As the
</p>
<p>injured party would otherwise suffer a much larger loss, it would benefit from
</p>
<p>such a solution. Once again negotiations would continue until marginal profit Π&rsquo;
</p>
<p>equals external marginal cost Cext&rsquo; at Em*.
</p>
<p>In either case, the negotiation process thus results in a maximization of joint
</p>
<p>profit or utility, respectively. This optimum can be analytically determined using a
</p>
<p>welfare function W defined as follows,
</p>
<p>W &frac14; Π Em&eth; &THORN; � Cext Em&eth; &THORN;: &eth;7:1&THORN;

</p>
<p>dEm
&frac14; 0 or Π0 &frac14; C0ext, respectively: &eth;7:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>This is the condition, &ldquo;marginal profit equals external marginal cost&rdquo;, which is
</p>
<p>satisfied at emission levels Em* in Figs. 7.1 and 7.2, respectively. Since external
</p>
<p>marginal cost C&rsquo;ext increases with emissions, Em
*
&lt; Em0 holds, indicating that the
</p>
<p>optimal amount of emissions is below the level that the company targets on its own
</p>
<p>(Pearce and Turner 1990, Chap. 4). At the same time, from an economic point of
</p>
<p>view it does not make sense in general to suppress production entirely because of
</p>
<p>external cost (therefore, Em* &gt; 0).
</p>
<p>The Coase theorem states that given an unambiguous initial allocation of
</p>
<p>property rights, negotiations leading to a Pareto optimum can be initiated, without
</p>
<p>the initial allocation concerning the good in question (&lsquo;unspoiled environment&rsquo; in
</p>
<p>the present context) having an impact on the resulting quantity of emissions. In a
</p>
<p>frictionless market economy, property rights constitute tradable goods. The theo-
</p>
<p>rem therefore amounts to a generalization of the exchange model without
</p>
<p>production.
</p>
<p>For the distribution of income and wealth, it obviously matters whether the
</p>
<p>property right is assigned to the polluter or to the injured party. Still, it would not
</p>
<p>make sense to prohibit the efficiency-enhancing exchanges of property rights
</p>
<p>predicted by the Coase theorem. Rather, if the original assignment is deemed
</p>
<p>unacceptable, an ex-post redistribution of income can be envisioned. Yet even
</p>
<p>then the application of the theorem is limited by a number of conditions that
</p>
<p>often fail to be satisfied.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Negligible transaction costs: For the transition from Em0 to Em
* to take place,
</p>
<p>the injured party must compensate the polluter not only for the profit foregone,
</p>
<p>but also for transaction costs (cost of negotiation, contracting, and monitoring&mdash;
</p>
<p>in short, costs of using the market). In reality, transaction costs are often too high
</p>
<p>to make negotiations over external damages worthwhile.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ndash; Clearly identifiable cause-effect relationships: Frequently it is extremely diffi-
</p>
<p>cult and costly to prove causality in the case of several polluters (&ldquo;Who caused
</p>
<p>the damage?&rdquo;). Liability law usually puts the burden of proof on the claimant,
</p>
<p>i.e. the injured party.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Small number of parties: As a rule, there are too many emission sources and
</p>
<p>injured parties for bilateral negotiations to be feasible. This may even hold for
</p>
<p>the case where the injured parties form an interest group.
</p>
<p>&ndash; No latency period in damages: Many damages caused by emissions become
</p>
<p>manifest with delay only. At the time of their emergence, the polluter may have
</p>
<p>exited from the market or lack the resources to compensate the external effect.
</p>
<p>&ndash; No intergenerational damages: In many cases, the individuals who may suffer
</p>
<p>from current emissions are not yet born. Therefore, the injured parties are
</p>
<p>represented by non-legitimized agents only. This problem in particular
</p>
<p>characterizes so-called long-tail damages caused by greenhouse gases and
</p>
<p>nuclear radiation.
</p>
<p>In sum, the Coase theorem shows that a market mechanism for property rights
</p>
<p>can lead to efficient levels of production and emission. However, in many
</p>
<p>circumstances important conditions for it to hold are not satisfied.
</p>
<p>To the extent that some of the points mentioned above are relevant, the alloca-
</p>
<p>tion of property rights and negotiations according to the Coase theorem may fail to
</p>
<p>result in a Pareto-optimal outcome. Market failure occurs, possibly calling for
</p>
<p>government intervention. For a Pareto-optimal outcome, government would have
</p>
<p>polluters reduce their emissions to Em*. In view of the assumed proportionality
</p>
<p>between production and emissions, this amounts to a reduction of output produced.
</p>
<p>The following sections are devoted to the question of how this can be achieved.
</p>
<p>However, note that government may fail in its endeavors as well.
</p>
<p>7.2 Aggregate Emissions
</p>
<p>Since an externality usually involves many polluters and injured parties, the
</p>
<p>analysis of the preceding section needs to be extended to the case of many
</p>
<p>companies and households. Let there be companies j that produce a single good,
</p>
<p>causing emissions Emj. In addition, there are households i who buy the product but
</p>
<p>have to bear immissions Imi whose impacts cannot always be expressed in money
</p>
<p>terms. Accordingly, the external cost function of the preceding section is replaced
</p>
<p>by the utility functionUi(Imi) of household i. This formulation supposes that a given
</p>
<p>household is affected by the immissions to an identifiable degree. In this way,
</p>
<p>immissions obtain the characteristics of a private good. This condition will be
</p>
<p>removed in a second step.
</p>
<p>If company profits are combined with the utilities of the households to form a
</p>
<p>social welfare function, the optimal amounts of individual emissions Emj and
</p>
<p>immissions Imi can be determined from the following optimization problem (see
</p>
<p>Mas-Colell et al. 1995, Chap. 11D),

<p>As to the profit functionΠj of company j, it depends on the company&rsquo;s emissions

<p>Emj and on the sales price p of its product. Similarly, utility Ui of household
</p>
<p>i depends on immissions Imi as well as the sales price p of the product. In the
</p>
<p>mathematical formulation below, the simplifying assumption is made that
</p>
<p>variations of Emj and Imi do not affect p. As before, profits of the company increase
</p>
<p>with emissions but at a decreasing rate. Conversely, utility of households decreases
</p>
<p>with immissions, and at an increasing rate. This means that the marginal cost
</p>
<p>(in utility terms) of immissions is rising. This description is a simplification of
</p>
<p>the often intricate connection between aggregate emissions and the sum of
</p>
<p>immissions as perceived at the individual level.
</p>
<p>The optimization problem incorporating the conditions contained in (7.3) can be

</p>
<p>that a zero or a negative value of Em is optimal. If however the maximum is in

<p>the interior of the solution space, it is characterized by the following first-order

</p>
<p>The value of the Lagrange multiplier λ* indicates how much a violation of the
</p>
<p>conditions stated in (7.3) would lower the value of the objective function (7.4). It
</p>
<p>therefore constitutes the shadow price of additional emissions (or immissions,
</p>
<p>respectively). Equation (7.5) states that in the optimum, this shadow price equals
</p>
<p>the marginal profit of company j, since this marginal profit is lost to the company in
</p>
<p>the case of a reduction of emissions. In this sense, λ* also represents the marginal
</p>
<p>cost of the good &lsquo;emission reduction&rsquo;. On the other hand, such a reduction spares
</p>
<p>148 7 External Costs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>household i a utility loss which would be caused by additional immissions (U&rsquo;i &lt;
</p>
<p>0). Therefore, optimality conditions (7.5) state that in a social optimum, the
</p>
<p>marginal cost of the good &lsquo;emission reduction&rsquo; coincides with its marginal utility.
</p>
<p>If a market for emission rights can be organized, λ* indicates the corresponding
</p>
<p>market price.
</p>
<p>This statement holds under the assumption that immissions have the character of
</p>
<p>a private good. If by contrast emissions have the properties of a pure public good,
</p>
<p>the optimization problem must be formulated in a different way. In this case, each
</p>
<p>household i is exposed to the total of emissions &sum;jEmj (or immissions, respec-
</p>
<p>tively). Therefore, only company-specific emissions Emj remain as decision

</p>
<p>Since emissions cannot be attributed to households individually, the constraints

</p>
<p>Recall that in this derivation, the amount of total emissions &sum;jEmj&mdash;and with it
</p>
<p>aggregate output&sum;jQj&mdash;has no influence on the product price. However, reductions
</p>
<p>in emissions go along with an increased scarcity of the final product, causing its
</p>
<p>equilibrium price to increase (to p** in Fig. 7.3). The higher sales price shifts the
</p>
<p>marginal profit function upward, with the consequence that the aggregate Pareto-
</p>
<p>optimal output exceeds &sum;Q*, to attain &sum;Q**. A formal development of this

<p>7.3 Instruments of Environmental Policy
</p>
<p>The analysis of the preceding section shows that it may be appropriate for the
</p>
<p>government to intervene in order to move the economy closer to the welfare
</p>
<p>maximum. Its interventions are of two types, so-called internalization approaches
</p>
<p>and standard-oriented approaches. The internalization approach calls for marginal
</p>
<p>external costs to be transformed into price signals which modify the behavior of
</p>
<p>market participants. However, agents remain free in their decision to respond to
</p>
<p>these price signals by reducing emissions or to pay for them. By way of contrast,
</p>
<p>when adopting the standard-oriented approach, the government determines emis-
</p>
<p>sion levels&mdash;at the aggregate or the individual level&mdash;which are not to be exceeded
</p>
<p>in any circumstance.
</p>
<p>7.3.1 Internalization Approaches
</p>
<p>The main internalization approaches are the following.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Voluntary agreement with sanctions: Polluters are asked to reduce their
</p>
<p>emissions on a voluntary basis; in case the agreement fails to be honored, the
</p>
<p>government threatens to apply other instruments. In the past, this instrument has
</p>
<p>proved effective in some instances. However, the actual imposition of the
</p>
<p>sanction is frequently deemed improbable, causing it to have little effect on
</p>
<p>behavior (i.e. polluters continue with business as usual). Sometimes, voluntary
</p>
<p>agreements are signed by industry associations, raising the issue of implementa-
</p>
<p>tion because associations usually lack the authority to enforce such agreements
</p>
<p>(they cannot rein in their &lsquo;black sheep&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Liability with mandatory insurance (Zweifel and Tyran 1994): If polluters are
</p>
<p>liable for environmental damages (see Sect. 7.3.2 below), they can still go

<p>bankrupt in order to escape payment of claims. This can be prevented by
</p>
<p>mandatory insurance coverage. Provided premiums are scaled according to
</p>
<p>probability and severity of environmental damages, insurance creates an incen-
</p>
<p>tive for the internalization of external cost.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Pigouvian tax (see Pigou 1932; Baumol and Oates 1988): By taxing emissions,
</p>
<p>the government puts a price on them. Polluters can then decide whether and how
</p>
<p>much they want to reduce emissions, or whether they prefer to pay the tax. The
</p>
<p>government obtains tax revenue that varies with emissions (which may give rise
</p>
<p>to the perverse incentive of not fighting them &lsquo;too much&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>Here, the Pigouvian tax is selected to illustrate the internalization concept and to
</p>
<p>point out some problems. Its optimal level can be derived from the optimality
</p>
<p>condition (7.7). Since the optimal rate taxj
* must be equal to the marginal cost of

</p>
<p>If companies use the same production technology (implying that Πj&rsquo; has the
</p>
<p>same value for all), then the Pigouvian tax causes all companies to reduce their
</p>
<p>emissions to the same optimal value. In this special case, it therefore has the same
</p>
<p>effect as a norm limiting emissions. As soon as companies differ in their production
</p>
<p>technologies and hence are characterized by different marginal profit functions, the
</p>
<p>equivalence between the Pigouvian tax and a norm is lost.
</p>
<p>For example, let all companies except one have the same production technology,
</p>
<p>with the exceptional one using a technology with lower marginal abatement cost.
</p>
<p>Since at a given rate of production and emissions, Π&rsquo;j is higher for this company
</p>
<p>j than its competitors, the uniform Pigouvian tax causes j to have a higher optimal
</p>
<p>level of emissions than all the others. For attaining the optimal level of aggregate
</p>
<p>emissions, its tax rate simply needs to be set higher compared to the case where all
</p>
<p>companies use the same technology. In contrast, a legal norm limiting emissions
</p>
<p>regardless of type of technology would force company j to scale back its emissions
</p>
<p>and output to a greater extent than its competitors, causing it to forego an excessive
</p>
<p>amount of profits. Therefore, as soon as technologies differ between companies, the
</p>
<p>Pigouvian tax dominates the emission norm in terms of efficiency.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, informational requirements for an efficient implementation of
</p>
<p>a Pigouvian tax are high. According to Eq. (7.7), preliminary company-specific
</p>
<p>values Emj need to be added up to calculate aggregate emissions. At that total, one
</p>
<p>has to determine the marginal utility loss of each individual affected. These values
</p>
<p>must again be plugged into Eq. (7.7), calling for a new set of values Emj on the part
</p>
<p>of companies inferred from their marginal profit functions Π&rsquo;j. It may take several
</p>
<p>iterations to come up with optimal company-specific tax rates.
</p>
<p>Failure of this procedure has important consequences. To illustrate, let the
</p>
<p>marginal profit function of a company be underestimated (Π0a in Fig. 7.4; subscript
</p>
<p>7.3 Instruments of Environmental Policy 151</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>j is omitted for simplicity). Accordingly, the tax rate would be set too low at taxa.
</p>
<p>This induces the company to target Ema,t rather than Em
*. Since marginal utility
</p>
<p>losses exceed marginal profit beyond Em*, an efficiency loss equivalent to the area J
*MN results.
</p>
<p>This problem becomes especially relevant whenever aggregate marginal utility
</p>
<p>losses (external marginal cost, respectively) cannot be estimated with precision. In
</p>
<p>sum, the internalization approaches have the advantage of taking differences in the
</p>
<p>marginal cost of abatement into account. However, they can themselves become a
</p>
<p>source of inefficiency as soon as they create wrong incentives for polluters.
</p>
<p>7.3.2 Standard-Oriented Approaches
</p>
<p>The most important standard-oriented approaches are the following.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Environmental liability (Shavell 1984): Liability law serves to internalize exter-
</p>
<p>nal effects that occur in the guise of accidents. It is standard-oriented because
</p>
<p>lawmakers and courts determine the admissible amount of external effects
</p>
<p>beyond which the injurer must come up with compensation. However, enforce-
</p>
<p>ment of a claim against a polluter through the courts frequently is burdened with
</p>
<p>high transaction cost. Relieving the injured party from the burden of proof would
</p>
<p>mitigate this problem considerably but might trigger so many law suits that
</p>
<p>entrepreneurial activity would be stifled.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Emission norms: Here, public authorities impose limits on emission levels
</p>
<p>(or rates, respectively), sanctioning violations. In actual practice, norms are the
</p>
<p>most frequently used instrument because they have a direct effect on emissions.
</p>
<p>In addition, they are deemed fair as they impose the same obligation on every-
</p>
<p>one. From an economic point of view, however, they cause efficiency losses as
</p>
<p>soon as polluters differ in terms of their (marginal) cost of abatement. In that
</p>
<p>situation, limits on aggregate emissions could be attained at lower cost. Finally,
</p>
<p>the threat of sanction must be credible. Yet imposing sanctions often goes along

<p>with high administrative expense and is subject to leakage effects, resulting in
</p>
<p>so-called administrative failure.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Standard-price approach (Baumol and Oates 1988): Here, the regulatory author-
</p>
<p>ity determines the admissible level of aggregate emissions, setting the internali-
</p>
<p>zation tax at a level ensuring that this standard is not exceeded. In case the
</p>
<p>standard is exceeded, it increases the tax rate, otherwise, it lowers
</p>
<p>it. Conceivably, the tax rate can even go to zero provided the aggregate emission
</p>
<p>target continues to be met. The standard-price approach is attractive whenever
</p>
<p>(marginal) external costs cannot be quantified with any confidence. One example
</p>
<p>is the greenhouse gas problem (see Sect. 10.2).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Tradable emission rights (Dales 1968): Again, the authority needs to determine
</p>
<p>the admissible amount of emissions. This quantity defines the amount of emis-
</p>
<p>sion rights, which are allocated to polluters according to a predetermined
</p>
<p>formula. At the same time, polluters may cause emissions only to the extent
</p>
<p>that they dispose of the corresponding amount of certificates. Since emission
</p>
<p>rights are tradable, polluters can purchase extra certificates if necessary. Note
</p>
<p>that the price for emission rights is not determined by the authority anymore but
</p>
<p>by market forces. In this way, market participants receive a signal indicating
</p>
<p>how binding their constraint on emissions is at the time [see the Lagrange
</p>
<p>multiplier λ in Eq. (7.4)]. This instrument has been in actual use within the
</p>
<p>European Union since 2005 for industrial CO2 emissions (see Sect. 10.3).
</p>
<p>Among these alternatives, the emission norm is expounded here. In Fig. 7.4, the
</p>
<p>emission norm appears as Ema,a. Ideally, it should satisfy efficiency condition (7.7).
</p>
<p>However, in this example, it has been set too low due to a wrong estimate of the
</p>
<p>marginal profit function (Π&rsquo;a rather than Πj). While the true optimum is Em
*, the
</p>
<p>norm Ema,a forces the polluter to undertake excessive abatement efforts, causing an
</p>
<p>efficiency loss equivalent to the area JJ*Q. Depending on the slopes of the marginal
</p>
<p>utility loss and marginal profit schedules, this efficiency loss may be greater or
</p>
<p>smaller than the one caused by a wrong internalization tax (J*MN). If the schedule
</p>
<p>showing marginal utility loss runs less steep than the one showing marginal profit,
</p>
<p>the emissions norm is less efficient than the Pigouvian tax. In environmental
</p>
<p>economics, this case is considered to be the rule. Only if the marginal utility loss
</p>
<p>schedule runs steeply compared to the marginal profit schedule, indicating great
</p>
<p>additional damage if the optimal emission level is exceeded, does the emission
</p>
<p>norm dominate in terms of efficiency.
</p>
<p>The ecological and economic advantages and disadvantages of these instruments
</p>
<p>have been debated extensively in the literature (see Baumol and Oates 1988). On
</p>
<p>the economic side, the efficiency criterion usually is center stage, calling for a given
</p>
<p>improvement of environmental quality to be achieved at minimum cost for society.
</p>
<p>However, other aspects need to be taken into account as well. In particular, the
</p>
<p>instruments of environmental policy differ in terms of distributional impact (for
</p>
<p>example, consider the formula determining the allocation of emission rights above).
</p>
<p>They also differ in their cost of implementation imposed on public authorities as

</p>
<p>diffusion of environmental innovation and hence economic development.
</p>
<p>7.4 Measuring External Costs of Energy Use
</p>
<p>As long as there are no markets for environmental goods, one must fall back on
</p>
<p>models to quantify (marginal) external costs (see also Sect. 10.3). This raises
</p>
<p>several methodological problems. Focusing on the bottom-up approach, one has
</p>
<p>to determine first the external effects that should be accounted for, if at all. From an
</p>
<p>anthropocentric point of view, all effects should be considered as damage if they are
</p>
<p>negatively valued by human beings, either by individuals or members of social
</p>
<p>groups and organizations. Note that this does not mean, &ldquo;Man is at the center of the
</p>
<p>universe&rdquo;, but rather, &ldquo;All value emanates from man&rdquo;. Thus, a biotope may qualify
</p>
<p>although it will never be seen by a human being and therefore cannot give rise to
</p>
<p>immediate utility, for it may nevertheless have so-called existence value to man.
</p>
<p>In keeping with anthropocentrism in valuation, extensive lists of damage
</p>
<p>categories have been dressed up. One can distinguish five categories, with most
</p>
<p>empirical studies limiting themselves to the first two.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Economic damages in the narrow sense: These comprise the destruction of
</p>
<p>physical assets causing losses of income and costs related to cleanup and repair.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Losses of human life and health: These are measured by the number of exposed
</p>
<p>persons, resulting in an expected value of years of life lost. Alternatively, the
</p>
<p>duration of or expenditure for medical treatment is estimated.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Losses of environment assets and environmental quality: Some of these losses
</p>
<p>may already be captured by category No. 1, potentially giving rise to double
</p>
<p>counting.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Losses of quality of life: These comprise exposure to noise and vibration, but
</p>
<p>also fear of catastrophes, reduced autonomy and self-fulfillment.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Loss of function: Economic, social and political institutions (e.g. civil protec-
</p>
<p>tion, provision of medical care) are prevented from functioning normally.
</p>
<p>Some authors also include the use of non-renewable energy resources as a
</p>
<p>damage category. However, this is open to debate. While it is true that this increases
</p>
<p>the future scarcity of the resource considered, there is no external effect as soon as
</p>
<p>its price reflects future scarcity (see Sect. 6.2). Similarly, including land consump-
</p>
<p>tion is debatable as well, because land is not really used up but (temporarily)
</p>
<p>withdrawn from other uses. Again, no external effect is usually involved since
</p>
<p>land use must be paid for in the guise of rent.
</p>
<p>For each damage category distinguished, the relationship with energy-related
</p>
<p>activities needs to be determined. In many cases, this requires detailed scientific
</p>
<p>(particularly chemical and engineering) knowledge.
</p>
<p>Usually, the first step is to measure the relevant emission at its source. Instances
</p>
<p>are emissions through the air (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide,

<p>particulate matter, and dioxin), emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and
</p>
<p>methane), water pollution (oil leakages), contamination of the soil (heavy metals),
</p>
<p>noise, odor and vibrations, as well as accident risks and the exposure to nuclear
</p>
<p>radiation.
</p>
<p>Next, immissions are the consequence of emissions, causing pollution of air,
</p>
<p>water, and soil. They result from cumulated emissions and processes of transfor-
</p>
<p>mation and decay. These natural mitigating processes sometimes can be enhanced
</p>
<p>by technical repair measures. Many of the connections between emissions and
</p>
<p>immissions are very complex, leaving questions open in spite of gains of knowledge
</p>
<p>achieved during the past decades.
</p>
<p>Third, the relationships between immissions and damages are complex as well,
</p>
<p>with damages frequently depending on the level of pollution in a nonlinear way.
</p>
<p>Also, some damages occur only when several pollutants interact, posing great
</p>
<p>scientific challenges to the identification of dose-response functions. Duration of
</p>
<p>immissions plays a role as well. Some damages occur many years or even decades
</p>
<p>after the emissions causing them. Finally, emissions require the existence of
</p>
<p>receptors (human beings, animals, plants, buildings) in order to cause damage.
</p>
<p>Determining the location of an emission relative to these receptors may therefore be
</p>
<p>of importance, too.
</p>
<p>Fourth, since profits are measured in money, damages need to be expressed in
</p>
<p>money terms as well in order to implement the optimum condition (7.7). For this
</p>
<p>monetization, one can use observations from market exchanges or try to measure
</p>
<p>willingness to pay for avoiding immissions. Several alternatives have been devel-
</p>
<p>oped in economics.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Estimation based on the cost of repair: One source of information is insurance
</p>
<p>payments for covered damages. At the aggregate level, one usually finds that the
</p>
<p>cost of repair increases progressively with the level or rate of emissions (increas-
</p>
<p>ing marginal damage cost).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Estimation based on the cost of avoidance: If the cost of repair cannot be
</p>
<p>quantified, the cost of avoiding (partially) the damage may serve as a substitute.
</p>
<p>Since typically lower-cost measures are performed first, followed by the higher-
</p>
<p>cost ones, one can infer that marginal cost must increase with the quantity of
</p>
<p>emissions avoided. This means that the value of marginal cost can be established
</p>
<p>only after determining the admissible quantity of emissions (see the standard-
</p>
<p>price approach discussed in Sect. 7.3.2 above).
</p>
<p>&ndash; In the case of the damage category &lsquo;human lives and health&rsquo;, the human capital
</p>
<p>approach is a popular alternative. Premature death or invalidity makes a person&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>knowledge and skills no longer available to society. For monetization, replace-
</p>
<p>ment cost or the present value of future labor income forgone has been used.
</p>
<p>Estimated values of a statistical life range from between 100,000 and 2 mn EUR.
</p>
<p>However, this approach singles out one dimension of human existence&mdash;gainful
</p>
<p>activity&mdash;thus rendering it questionable. Moreover, valuation is by society
</p>
<p>(through the labor market) rather than the individual person, reminiscent of a
</p>
<p>slave economy.
</p>
<p>7.4 Measuring External Costs of Energy Use 155</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ndash; Estimation based on market transactions (also known as hedonic price
</p>
<p>approach): The statistical value of a human life can be derived from observing
</p>
<p>individuals who (e.g. through their choice of a risky activity) are prepared to
</p>
<p>expose themselves to life and health risks in return for a financial advantage.
</p>
<p>Conversely, they may accept a financial disadvantage in return for a marginally
</p>
<p>lower risk. The statistical value of a human life can then be calculated as follows.
</p>
<p>If one percentage point more probability of survival is associated with x EUR,
</p>
<p>then the whole life should approximately be worth 100x EUR. Published values
</p>
<p>are in a range between 100,000 and 2 mn EUR. However, other types of damage
</p>
<p>can be monetized as well in this way, by measuring the effort required to avoid
</p>
<p>an emission. An example is the difference in the price of land between residen-
</p>
<p>tial areas with good and mediocre air quality.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Estimation based on surveys: Especially in the context of planned interventions
</p>
<p>and product innovations where actual behavior cannot be observed, economists
</p>
<p>increasingly rely on so-called market experiments. The objective is to measure
</p>
<p>(marginal) willingness to pay (WTP) for obtaining an advantage or avoiding a
</p>
<p>disadvantage. The conventional approach is Contingent Valuation (see
</p>
<p>e.g. Cummings et al. 1986; Hausman 1993). Here, all attributes of the hypotheti-
</p>
<p>cal alternative to the status quo are held constant except price. While WTP can
</p>
<p>be elicited directly, the values obtained usually are overestimates. The reason is
</p>
<p>that respondents tend to excessively focus on price, neglect competing claims to
</p>
<p>their budget, and may be tempted to answer strategically. An extreme case is the
</p>
<p>value of human life; most respondents would deem this &lsquo;good&rsquo; as non-tradable,
</p>
<p>causing refusal to state a money value. Otherwise, if stating a value at all, they
</p>
<p>typically would put it to infinity.
</p>
<p>To avoid these problems, economists increasingly use so-called Conjoint Anal-
</p>
<p>ysis. Respondents are confronted with a set of alternatives whose attributes take on
</p>
<p>different levels each time. In the Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) variant of
</p>
<p>Conjoint Analysis, respondents merely have to indicate whether they prefer the
</p>
<p>status quo or the alternative in question. From their repeated choices, their indiffer-
</p>
<p>ence curve through the status quo point can be interpolated. Through the price of the
</p>
<p>product, their remaining disposable income becomes a product attribute, permitting
</p>
<p>to infer marginal WTP values from the slope of the indifference curve. Therefore, a
</p>
<p>WTP value can be estimated for each attribute and the alternative as a whole. Based
</p>
<p>on this more realistic approach, much lower values are usually estimated than with
</p>
<p>Contingent Valuation. For instance, Schneider and Zweifel (2004), using a DCE,
</p>
<p>obtain a marginal WTP value of the Swiss population of only 0.1 EUR ct/kWh for
</p>
<p>benefiting from improved financial security in case of a major nuclear accident (see
</p>
<p>also Sect. 11.3.3).
</p>
<p>There are quite a few estimates of energy-related external cost. Due to different
</p>
<p>methods, model assumptions, and data, results differ substantially. One of the
</p>
<p>internationally important investigations was performed for the Commission of the
</p>
<p>European Union (ExternE; see Directorate General Research 2003). It uses the
</p>
<p>bottom-up-concept detailed above.

<p>Table 7.1 exhibits estimated external marginal costs for several modern power
</p>
<p>generation technologies in Germany. They represent marginal avoidance costs,
</p>
<p>which should be pitted against marginal profit losses due to abatement for optimi-
</p>
<p>zation. Since marginal abatement cost (excluding greenhouse gas effects which are
</p>
<p>singled out for separate analysis, see below) is lower than marginal damage cost
</p>
<p>throughout, more abatement effort is indicated for all energy sources. Marginal
</p>
<p>damage cost is lowest for hydropower, followed by wind power and nuclear.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the optimal internalization tax lies between 0.03 and 0.05 EUR ct/
</p>
<p>kWh for hydro power. It is typically higher in the case of nuclear power, with a
</p>
<p>range between 0.001 and a high 0.17 EUR ct/kWh, and attaining a maximum value
</p>
<p>in the case of lignite between 0.78 and 1.01 EUR ct/kWh.
</p>
<p>The same study also contains estimates of the marginal external cost of
</p>
<p>transportation-related air emissions. For private passenger traffic in urban areas, it
</p>
<p>comes up with values between 0.08 and 1.03 EUR per 100 passenger-kilometers
</p>
<p>(pkm). For long-haul passenger trips, external costs depend on the mode of trans-
</p>
<p>portation. In the case of the railroad, they lie between 0.1 and 0.2 EUR per 100 pkm,
</p>
<p>in the case of the automobile, between 0.6 and 1.2 EUR per 100 pkm.

<p>Markets for Liquid Fuels 8
</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on markets for crude oil and oil products including gasoline,
</p>
<p>kerosene, diesel, heating oil, as well as biogenic fuels such as biodiesel, bioethanol,
</p>
<p>and synthetic fuels. Since the mid-twentieth century, crude oil has been the world&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>most important energy source. However, the future prospects of crude oil are more
</p>
<p>unclear than ever. A lot of issues have to be analyzed:
</p>
<p>&ndash; What is the development of oil extraction?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What technical and economic consequences are to be expected if conventional
</p>
<p>crude oil extraction falls short of the demand for liquid fuels?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What about the so-called peak oil hypothesis from an economic perspective?
</p>
<p>&ndash; At what oil prices would alternative fuels, such as unconventional oils, biogenic
</p>
<p>fuels, and liquefied coal become competitive?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How can the structure of the oil industry be explained in economic terms?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What is the role of governments in exporting and importing countries?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the influences on the price of oil in the short, medium, and long term?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What is the relationship between spot and future prices?
</p>
<p>&ndash; To what extent are oil prices influenced by speculation?
</p>

<p>8.1 Types of Liquid Fuels and Their Properties
</p>
<p>Under normal atmospheric pressure, liquid energy sources are in a liquid physical
</p>
<p>state. This makes their storage, transferal, and transportation easy, i.e. low-cost.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, liquid energy sources have high energy density. For example, a 50 l
</p>
<p>gasoline tank has an energy content of about 32.4 � 50 &frac14; 1620 MJ or 450 kWh,
respectively (see Table 8.7). Assuming that the filling of such a gasoline tank takes
</p>
<p>two minutes, the filling capacity of a gasoline pump amounts to 13.5 MW (&frac14;
30�450 kWh/h). A single gas station with eight gasoline pumps therefore has the
potential to sell the same amount of energy (i.e. 108 MW) as 54 wind turbines with
</p>
<p>a capacity of 2 MW each. These advantages are the reason for the dominance of oil
</p>
<p>products in the transportation sector and their overall leading position in global
</p>
<p>energy markets since the mid-twentieth century.
</p>
<p>However, reserves of crude oil are limited and likely to be exhausted in a not-
</p>
<p>too-distant future (see Sect. 8.1.3). Additionally, there is the environmental burden
</p>
<p>caused by the emission of greenhouse gases associated with the combustion of
</p>
<p>crude oil products. The content of the 50 l gasoline tank in the example above leads
</p>
<p>to the release of 117 kg CO2 into the atmosphere. On a global scale, about 40% of
</p>
<p>energy-related CO2 emissions derive from the combustion of crude oil. While these
</p>
<p>two issues represent important challenges in the foreseeable future, there is no
</p>
<p>general consensus about how to deal with them. For instance, it remains unclear
</p>
<p>whether renewable liquid fuels or renewable electricity will be able to substitute
</p>
<p>fossil liquid fuels to a sufficient degree.
</p>
<p>8.1.1 Properties of Crude Oil
</p>
<p>There are many data sources regarding crude oil, albeit in differing units of
</p>
<p>measurement. Therefore, the data need to be converted to a common energy unit.
</p>
<p>While there are conversion tables, they often fail to achieve comparability because
</p>
<p>crude oil is a natural product and thus a heterogeneous good. In particular, energy
</p>
<p>content differs between production sites, depending on the so-called crude oil
</p>
<p>density of the liquid. Thus, the conversion factors presented in Table 8.1 are
</p>
<p>based on a crude oil density of 0.858 kg/l or 7.33 bbl/ton, respectively.
</p>
<p>For the oil industry, two crucial dimensions of quality are the density of
</p>
<p>hydrocarbon compounds and the viscosity of crude measured in API grades defined
</p>
<p>by the American Petroleum Institute (see Fig. 8.1). The economic value of crude
</p>
<p>increases with higher API grades. Therefore, condensates and light varieties fetch
</p>
<p>a higher price than heavy oil and tar sands. Crude oil varieties with values below
</p>
<p>25� API count as unconventional oils. Below a level of 10� API, hydrocarbon
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>compounds are not capable of flowing and hence transportation by pipeline.
</p>
<p>Another important characteristic of crude oils is their sulfur content. Low-sulfur
</p>
<p>oil is called sweet crude, whereas sulfur-rich oil is called sour crude.
</p>
<p>American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and European Brent are high-quality
</p>
<p>crudes serving as a benchmark, with around 42� API and sulfur contents below
0.3%. Other crudes such as Dubai Crude with 31� API and 2% sulfur content
constitute the benchmark for oil from the Persian Gulf. Usually sulfur-rich oil is
</p>
<p>traded at a price discount compared to WTI and Brent (see Table 8.2). However,
</p>
<p>since these benchmark crudes are physically available at different locations, trans-
</p>
<p>portation bottlenecks and perturbations of local markets have resulted in price
</p>
<p>differences in excess of 25 USD/bbl in favor of WTI in recent years.
</p>
<p>8.1.2 Reserves and Extraction of Conventional Oil
</p>
<p>Known and economically recoverable reserves of conventional crude oil are
</p>
<p>unevenly distributed over the globe. According to Table 8.3, more one-half of
</p>
<p>them are concentrated in the Middle East (most of it around the Persian Gulf) and
</p>
<p>in Central Asia. This region of the world plus Russia is known as the &lsquo;energy
</p>
<p>ellipse&rsquo; which accounts for nearly 40% of global supply in terms of conventional
</p>
<p>crude oil.
</p>
<p>By way of contrast, the global share of crude oil extraction in OECD countries is
</p>
<p>far higher than their global share of reserves. Therefore, OECD countries will have
</p>
<p>less control over the supply of oil in future, while countries in the energy ellipse and

<p>OPEC (Organization of Oil Exporting Countries) countries can be expected to exert
</p>
<p>a growing influence on the global market for conventional oil. However, as
</p>
<p>expounded in Sect. 8.1.4 below, technological change has been increasing the
</p>
<p>supply of unconventional oil.
</p>
<p>The effect if this geographic concentration is exacerbated by widely varying
</p>
<p>costs of extraction. While they are below 40 USD/bbl in the Persian Gulf on
</p>
<p>average, they can be as much as twice as high in other regions of the world (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.2). However, this cost advantage may be undermined by technological
</p>
<p>change. An example is the cost reduction in offshore production during the

<p>1980s. In the early 1980s, retrieving oil from the North Sea cost 17 USD/bbl,
</p>
<p>causing production to become competitive only after the second oil price shock of
</p>
<p>1979 when the sales price jumped from 10 to 30 USD/bbl. Yet, ten years later
</p>
<p>offshore production cost was down to 8 USD/bbl. This cost reduction occurred
</p>
<p>despite the fact that compared to other industries, the oil industry invests a small
</p>
<p>share of its earnings in research and development.
</p>
<p>8.1.3 Peak Oil Hypothesis
</p>
<p>Motorization in the United States led to a phenomenal increase in oil consumption
</p>
<p>during the 1950s. It was during this decade that geologists began to address the
</p>
<p>question of how long it would take for crude oil reserves in the United States to be
</p>
<p>depleted. At that time, the U.S. share in global production exceeded 50%. In 1956,
</p>
<p>geologist Hubbert (1956, 1962) predicted that oil production in the United States
</p>
<p>would peak by 1970 and decline from then on (in the so-called lower 48 states, thus
</p>
<p>excluding production in Alaska and offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico).
</p>
<p>His forecast proved true (see Fig. 8.3). It was based on a logistic function, which
</p>
<p>in the present context implies that the accumulation of production will approach an
</p>
<p>upper limit which equals total reserves (see Fig. 4.2). More specifically, according
</p>
<p>to the standard logistic function, rates of production begin to decline once one-half
</p>
<p>of total reserves have been retrieved (this is also known as the depletion midpoint).
</p>
<p>By fitting observed production rates to the logistic function, Hubbert was able to
</p>
<p>determine the two parameters determining the logistic function, which in turn
</p>
<p>permits to predict the depletion midpoint and hence the year when the rate of
</p>
<p>production will attain its maximum.

<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_4">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_4</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Note that the use of the logistic function can be justified with a change in
</p>
<p>marginal cost: At the start of exploitation, few oil fields are known and experience
</p>
<p>in exploration is lacking, causing the cost of locating an additional field to be high.
</p>
<p>With cumulated exploitation and production, the marginal cost of discovering and
</p>
<p>developing an oil field decreases, facilitating a high rate of production. Beyond
</p>
<p>some point however, marginal cost begins to increase again because easily accessi-
</p>
<p>ble fields are depleted. This puts downward pressure on the rate of discovery and
</p>
<p>ultimately, the rate of production&mdash;unless the sales price of oil goes up in real
</p>
<p>terms, as e.g. during 1970s with its two oil price shocks (Kaufmann and Cleveland
</p>
<p>2001; Reynolds 2002). Moreover, pressure in developed oil deposits declines with
</p>
<p>cumulated production. In order to compensate for this, water, steam, or carbon
</p>
<p>dioxide is pressed into the deposit, a process known as enhanced oil recovery. Of
</p>
<p>course, enhanced oil recovery is associated with an increase in the marginal cost of
</p>
<p>production; thus, it slows the decline in production rates but does not reverse the
</p>
<p>trend.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the peak oil hypothesis has been applied to global oil produc-
</p>
<p>tion on the grounds that global reserves are limited as well. In keeping with the
</p>
<p>Hotelling price path (see Sect. 6.2.2), lower-cost reserves are exploited first,
</p>
<p>followed by higher-cost alternatives such as Alaska in the case of the United States.
</p>
<p>Indeed, Fig. 8.3 exhibits rising, then falling rates of production. Yet, the figure also
</p>
<p>points to an intriguing constancy. In 1956, Hubbert predicted peak oil for 1970,
</p>
<p>i.e. 14 years away. In 1970, oil production in Alaska began to take off&mdash;and peaked
</p>
<p>again about 15 years later. Shortly after the year 2000, some experts saw the rate of
</p>
<p>global production peak 8 to 22 years into the future (averaging 15 years), while
</p>
<p>some others did not predict a peak at all.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The prediction of 8 years has already proved wrong since between 2002 and
</p>
<p>2010, global production of crude increased in 8 out of 11 years at rates up to 5%,
</p>
<p>while the maximum decrease was �1.7%. Overall, it continued to increase up to
2013 (U.S. Energy Information Administration). Cumulated global oil production
</p>
<p>exceeded 1200 bn bbl in 2002; this is equivalent to 330 years of peak production in
</p>
<p>the United States (3400 mn bbl/a &frac14; 365�9.5 mn bbl/day as of 1970; see Fig. 8.3).
Therefore, up to present economic incentives have been causing resources to be
</p>
<p>transformed into reserves at a pace that has kept up with growth in production and
</p>
<p>consumption. In hindsight, Hubbert&rsquo;s success in predicting the 1970 peak in
</p>
<p>U.S. oil production, being based on the assumption of a predetermined amount of
</p>
<p>reserves, seems to be a coincidence rather than the result of in-depth analysis
</p>
<p>(Kaufmann and Cleveland 2001).
</p>
<p>Table 8.4 shows estimates of the expected dates and the quantities of maximum
</p>
<p>conventional crude oil extraction, all of them published before 2004. In spite of
</p>
<p>differences which might be related to the affiliation of the respective experts, the
</p>
<p>consensus at the time was that depletion midpoint will be reached by 2020 or
</p>
<p>2025 at the latest.
</p>
<p>Indeed, economists including Adelman (2002) and Lynch (2002) have argued
</p>
<p>that it has been possible to overcome resource scarcities through innovation up to
</p>
<p>now, suggesting that this might hold true in future as well. For example, Fig. 8.3
</p>
<p>shows that the production decline in the United States predicted by Hubbert was
</p>
<p>substantially delayed thanks to advanced extraction technologies and the develop-
</p>
<p>ment of new oil fields (Alaska, deep offshore). At present, this view is confirmed by
</p>
<p>the growth of oil production in North America and other regions. Specifically, the
</p>
<p>&lsquo;cracking revolution&rsquo; has again made the United States one of the largest oil
</p>
<p>producers worldwide and may even transform it into a net oil exporter before
</p>
<p>long. Globally, there are many inventions that have the potential to result in
</p>
<p>innovative technologies that will delay the peak in oil production (see Sect. 8.3.2,
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.10).
</p>
<p>Sometimes the peak oil hypothesis is claimed to be supported by the fact that
</p>
<p>several private oil companies had to adjust their crude oil reserves downwards in
</p>
<p>recent years. But their reporting of reserves does not only depend on geological

<p>facts but also on institutions governing the market (see Sect. 6.1). Today, many oil
</p>
<p>fields are exploited under so-called production sharing agreements between public
</p>
<p>(governmental) and private partners. The private partner obtains a share of the
</p>
<p>reserves designed to ensure a rate of production and hence sales revenue that is
</p>
<p>sufficient to cover the cost of extraction plus a negotiated return on invested capital,
</p>
<p>while the public partner retains the rest. In case of rising oil prices, production
</p>
<p>sharing agreements typically permit governments to reduce the private share of
</p>
<p>reserves on the grounds that the same sales revenue can now be obtained from a
</p>
<p>lower rate of production (which is true in view of a short-term price elasticity of
</p>
<p>demand below one, as evidenced in Table 5.3. This causes the private partner to
</p>
<p>report less reserves, even though one would expect that rising oil prices lead to an
</p>
<p>increase in reserves.
</p>
<p>8.1.4 Unconventional Oil
</p>
<p>Unconventional crude oil includes heavy crude oil, oil sands, bitumen, tar sands,
</p>
<p>and shale oil. While estimates of reserves vary, the existence of huge deposits of
</p>
<p>heavy oil and tar sands is not in doubt. Deposits in the Orinoco basin in Venezuela
</p>
<p>and sands in Western Canada alone amount to 300 bn bbl of oil, a substantial
</p>
<p>addition to global reserves of conventional oil of roughly 1200 bn bbl (see
</p>
<p>Table 8.3).
</p>
<p>Thanks to technological change, unconventional reserves can sooner or later be
</p>
<p>retrieved at a cost that makes them competitive against conventional alternatives.
</p>
<p>Oil sands even enjoy an advantage over conventional crude because their deposits
</p>
<p>are already known, obviating most expenses for exploration. However, extracting
</p>
<p>unconventional oil is far more complex and hence costly than extracting conven-
</p>
<p>tional crude. For this, there are two commonly used processes with the following
</p>
<p>properties:
</p>
<p>&ndash; In the case of surface mining, oil sands are dredged and mixed with hot water.
</p>
<p>This mixture, also called slurry, is pumped through pipelines to treatment plants,
</p>
<p>where the bitumen is separated from the sand, mineral clay, salt, and water. After
</p>
<p>cleaning, the sand is recycled to fill the excavated mine, while the water is
</p>
<p>channeled to sedimentation tanks, to be used again eventually.
</p>
<p>&ndash; In the in situ process, hot steam or CO2 is injected into the oil layer in order to
</p>
<p>dilute the bitumen and make it flow. This mixture is extracted using conventional
</p>
<p>crude oil production technologies (i.e. steam-assisted gravity drainage, vapor
</p>
<p>extraction, and cyclic steam simulation). The in situ process also allows extrac-
</p>
<p>tion of unconventional oil from deep deposits. A more recent technology is
</p>
<p>fracking, which was first applied to shale gas (see Sect. 9.1.2) but is now also
</p>
<p>used to retrieve shale oil.
</p>
<p>As a rule, the production of unconventional oil is more expensive than the
</p>
<p>extraction of conventional crude oil. It also causes a greater environmental burden

<p>in terms of land use, energy input, and risks to drinking water. However, hikes in the
</p>
<p>price of crude oil have triggered large inflows of capital into research and develop-
</p>
<p>ment of extraction technologies as well as the development of unconventional
</p>
<p>deposits, preparing the ground for future growth of production.
</p>
<p>8.1.5 Refineries and Oil Products
</p>
<p>Profit margins are significantly higher in the extraction than in the refinery business,
</p>
<p>but refineries still represent the technological core of the oil value chain. In
</p>
<p>refineries, crude oil is processed into final energy sources such as gasoline, kero-
</p>
<p>sene, diesel, and fuel oil. Their properties are listed in Table 8.5.
</p>
<p>The refinery process can be divided into several sub-processes. Traditionally, the
</p>
<p>most important sub-process is distillation, where the chemical components of crude
</p>
<p>oil are separated in so-called fractions through heating and evaporation. Having
</p>
<p>different boiling temperatures (with water highest at 100 �C), they can be made to
condensate at different levels in distillation towers. Particularly light fractions like
</p>
<p>methane, ethane, propane, and butane are collected at the top of the tower as
</p>
<p>so-called condensates or refinery gas. They are followed by gasoline and diesel in
</p>
<p>the medium levels, and residues in the lower levels of the tower.
</p>
<p>Evidently, only products that are part of the raw material can be obtained
</p>
<p>through distillation. Yet refinery operators aim to maximize the output of light oil
</p>
<p>products which can be sold at higher prices. To increase their share, heavy fuel oil
</p>
<p>and distillation residues are further processed in conversion plants where their long
</p>
<p>and heavy hydrocarbon molecules are split into shorter and lighter molecular chains
</p>
<p>using so-called cracking.
</p>
<p>There are three types of cracking processes: thermal, catalytic, and hydro
</p>
<p>cracking. In thermal cracking, the molecular bonds of large hydrocarbon molecules
</p>
<p>are broken up by heating the distillation residue up to a temperature of about
</p>
<p>500 �C. Catalytic cracking uses a catalyst, e.g. synthetic aluminum silicate, for
breaking up molecular bonds. The most flexible but also most costly conversion
</p>
<p>technology is hydro cracking. Here, hydrogen atoms are added at the ends of broken
</p>
<p>molecular chains in order to chemically stabilize them, making it possible to mainly
</p>
<p>produce gasoline and diesel. However, the process requires operation under high

<p>pressure (100&ndash;150 bar) and large quantities of hydrogen, often calling for the
</p>
<p>construction of a hydrogen-producing plant.
</p>
<p>Table 8.6 shows a typical product portfolio of modern refineries. Without
</p>
<p>conversion, no more than 22% of output is gasoline, while up to 60% is lower-
</p>
<p>valued heavy oil. Catalytic cracking increases the gasoline share to 47%, hydro
</p>
<p>cracking, even to a maximum of 55%.
</p>
<p>Refineries reach an average efficiency of about 82%. This is a high value since
</p>
<p>transportation to filling stations and other customers is deducted from output. Thus,
</p>
<p>the energy contained in all refined products sold to final consumers amounts to a
</p>
<p>82% of total energy input from crude oil, natural gas, electricity, diesel, and
</p>
<p>gasoline.
</p>
<p>An important managerial decision is where to locate a refinery. A distinction can
</p>
<p>be made between supply-oriented locations close to extraction sites and sea ports in
</p>
<p>importing countries and sales-oriented locations close to final consumers. Both
</p>
<p>types come with advantages and downsides. Sales-oriented locations facilitate cost-
</p>
<p>efficient, high-volume transportation of crude by pipeline and supertanker. This
</p>
<p>enables refineries to quickly adapt to changes in the structure of demand. Con-
</p>
<p>versely, supply-oriented locations of refineries require more complex logistics
</p>
<p>because different products need to be transported over long distances. However,
</p>
<p>when sales prices are volatile and differ between destinations, supply-oriented
</p>
<p>locations make arbitrage possible. Oil companies simply redirect their deliveries
</p>
<p>(often already en route on the open sea) to the destination with the highest sales
</p>
<p>price (which usually offers the highest profit margin in view of low extra transpor-
</p>
<p>tation cost). Therefore, supply-oriented locations of refineries may increase com-
</p>
<p>pany profits while contributing to a convergence of prices of refined products.

<p>8.1.6 Biogenic Liquid Fuels
</p>
<p>Whereas in most uses of energy, oil products are in competition with other fossil
</p>
<p>fuels such as natural gas and coal, they continue to dominate in the transportation
</p>
<p>sector. Electric railways aside, this sector depends almost exclusively on oil. Yet
</p>
<p>considerable effort is being undertaken to introduce alternative fuels for transpor-
</p>
<p>tation. The motivation is not only to enhance the security of energy supply by
</p>
<p>lessening the dominance of oil but also to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Since

<p>these emissions are substantial in the conversion of gas to liquid (GtL) and coal to
</p>
<p>liquid (CtL), respectively, use of biomass as a liquid transportation fuel has been
</p>
<p>gaining attention. There are several options for biomass to liquid (BtL):
</p>
<p>&ndash; Biodiesel (rapeseed oil methyl ester) is produced from oily plants (e.g. rape, soy,
</p>
<p>sun flower). Oil gained from conventional oil mills (e.g. rapeseed oil) contains
</p>
<p>viscous components (see Table 8.7) and therefore needs to be converted into
</p>
<p>fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) in order to become a diesel substitute. Further-
</p>
<p>more, methanol is added to make up about 10% of the final product, which can
</p>
<p>be marketed as pure biodiesel or added to conventional diesel (so-called blend-
</p>
<p>ing). In the European Union biodiesel production reached a volume of 9 mn tons
</p>
<p>by 2010 but has been declining since because biodiesel offers only limited
</p>
<p>environmental advantages over diesel. Its production cost varies between 0.55
</p>
<p>and 0.70 EUR/l diesel equivalent. Assuming equal tax treatment of diesel and
</p>
<p>biodiesel, the renewable fuel would be competitive at prices of crude in excess of
</p>
<p>100 USD/bbl only.1
</p>
<p>&ndash; Bioethanol (alcohol) is produced by the fermentation of plants with high sugar
</p>
<p>content. In 2014, worldwide bioethanol production has reached 90 bn liter
</p>
<p>(of which the United States accounts for 57% and Brazil for 27%). Bioethanol
</p>
<p>is mostly sold as blend (as E10 in parts of the European Union, which is 90%
</p>
<p>gasoline and 10% bioethanol) because this obviates adjustments in refueling
</p>
<p>infrastructure and gasoline engines. Production cost of bioethanol ranges from

<p>the European Union. The energy equivalent of one liter of bioethanol
</p>
<p>corresponds to 0.65 liter of gasoline. This makes Brazilian bioethanol competi-
</p>
<p>tive at prices of crude oil of 50 USD/bbl while European ethanol becomes
</p>
<p>competitive at prices above 140 USD/bbl only.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Biofuels of the second generation (also known as BtL, biomass to liquid) are
</p>
<p>produced using advanced technologies such as biomass gasification with a
</p>
<p>subsequent Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Another innovation in the making is the
</p>
<p>utilization of enzymes for decomposing fibrous parts of plants designed to allow
</p>
<p>the energetic use of the entire plant mass. Unfortunately none of these
</p>
<p>technologies have been proven to be feasible outside the laboratory up to now.
</p>
<p>With the exception of Brazilian ethanol, the supply of biofuels at present
</p>
<p>depends on political support such as (partial) exemptions from fuel tax and manda-
</p>
<p>tory blending quotas for gasoline and diesel. Additionally, there are agricultural
</p>
<p>subsidies. The subsidization of biofuels has been justified by arguments derived
</p>
<p>from the theory of innovation. By creating a market niche for the corresponding
</p>
<p>technologies and cultivation practices, an industry can benefit from learning effects
</p>
<p>which might lead to cost reductions. The hope is that in future, increasing market
</p>
<p>shares can be obtained without political support (see IEA 2000; Nakicenovic 2002).
</p>
<p>The risk is that this support creates a pressure group that has a strong interest in its
</p>
<p>continuation. Experience shows that subsidies in particular are very difficult to
</p>
<p>terminate.
</p>
<p>The production of biofuels is limited by the availability of arable land and yields.
</p>
<p>It can have a potentially negative impact on food security but also on biogas
</p>
<p>production (see Sect. 9.1.3). Table 8.8 shows the present range of yields for grains
</p>
<p>and oil plants in Central Europe. Using the example of biodiesel, 3.3 tons of
</p>
<p>rapeseed can be harvested per hectare given medium yields, resulting in 1.3 tons
</p>
<p>of rapeseed oil (given a yield of 0.4 tons rapeseed oil per ton rapeseed). Using the

<p>heating value of 37.6 MJ/kg in Table 8.7, the energy content of this harvest can be

<p>estimated at 49,000 GJ. About one-third of this energy is needed as an input into its
</p>
<p>transformation into biodiesel, leaving some 33,000 GJ per hectare for energy use.

<p>According to Table 8.7, this is the energy content of 1000 l biodiesel (32.6

</p>
<p>8.2 Crude Oil Market
</p>
<p>During the 150 years of its history, the oil industry has gone through clearly distinct
</p>
<p>phases, which were characterized by differing market structures. Transition
</p>
<p>between these phases caused major changes affecting the oil industry, market
</p>
<p>participants, and the governments of oil-producing and oil-importing countries. It
</p>
<p>is important to understand the reasons for the relative stability during these phases
</p>
<p>as well as the transitions between them. This calls for the application of economic
</p>
<p>theory, in particular industrial economics and game theory.
</p>
<p>8.2.1 Vertically Integrated Monopoly
</p>
<p>Oil production on an industrial scale began in 1859 in Pennsylvania (United States).
</p>
<p>With the development of distillation technology, kerosene produced from crude oil
</p>
<p>became the preferred energy source for lighting. Previously, oil lamps had been
</p>
<p>fueled with whale oil, almost causing the extinction of whales due to overfishing.
</p>
<p>Thus, the substitution of whale oil by crude oil can be cited as the timely solution to
</p>
<p>an urgent resource problem.
</p>
<p>Thanks to its advanced refining technology as well as rude competitive practices,
</p>
<p>the Standard Oil Company founded by John D. Rockefeller was able to achieve a
</p>
<p>monopolistic position on the American refinery market within a decade. After 1880,
</p>
<p>the company became a dominant player also in the U.S. extraction, transportation,
</p>
<p>and distribution business. However, pursuant the Sherman Act of 1890 (also known
</p>
<p>as Antitrust Act), in 1911 the Standard Oil Company was split into 34 independent
</p>
<p>companies. Over time, some of these companies (Amoco, Chevron, Conoco,
</p>
<p>Exxon, Marathon, and Mobil) developed into the so-called oil majors that continue
</p>
<p>to operate on a worldwide scale to this very day.
</p>
<p>The typical feature of oil majors is their vertical integration, meaning that they
</p>
<p>control the value chain from prospection, extraction, and transportation on to
</p>
<p>8.2 Crude Oil Market 171</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>distribution to final consumers. What was the reason that the new oil industry
</p>
<p>evolved rather quickly into a vertically integrated monopoly (up to 1911)? The
</p>
<p>answer derives from an economic analysis of vertical integration, which
</p>
<p>emphasizes its efficiency advantages. Traditionally, economists have associated
</p>
<p>efficiency with arms-length market transactions, which are replaced by in-house
</p>
<p>command-and-control relationships in vertically integrated companies. Yet
</p>
<p>according to Grossman and Hart (1986), command and control tends to lose any
</p>
<p>initial efficiency advantage because the corrective of market competition is absent.2
</p>
<p>They argue that vertically integrated companies survive and may even dominate
</p>
<p>markets because they are able to force competitors out while preventing market
</p>
<p>entry by potential newcomers. Indeed, the oil industry&rsquo;s value chain has several
</p>
<p>characteristics that facilitate dominance by a vertically integrated company:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Kerosene and other oil products are commodities with relatively homogenous
</p>
<p>properties. In this situation, the famous law of one price holds. Thus, a refinery
</p>
<p>operator who has lower cost of production than its competitors (e.g. thanks to
</p>
<p>better equipment) has a competitive advantage. If in addition the refinery stage
</p>
<p>exhibits economies of scale (i.e. marginal cost and with it, average cost declines
</p>
<p>with increasing volume of output), the company with the initial cost advantage
</p>
<p>can achieve an ever growing market share, leaving no chance to smaller
</p>
<p>competitors and newcomers.
</p>
<p>&ndash; A company dominating one stage of the value chain may be able to extend its
</p>
<p>control to the next stage, e.g. by creating a network of sales outlets that closes the
</p>
<p>market to independent retailers (so-called vertical foreclosure, see Tirole 1988,
</p>
<p>p. 193). In the case of Standard Oil, vertical foreclosure was first achieved
</p>
<p>&lsquo;upstream&rsquo;, by making railway companies depend on its high volume of orders
</p>
<p>for transporting crude oil and finally buying them up. In this way, competing
</p>
<p>refineries were cut off from the supply of crude oil. In a second step, Standard
</p>
<p>Oil also performed &lsquo;downstream&rsquo; foreclosure by so-called exclusive dealing,
</p>
<p>i.e. by creating a dense network of gas stations that agreed to purchase their
</p>
<p>supply from Standard Oil only.
</p>
<p>However, vertical integration has also been viewed in a more favorable light,
</p>
<p>starting with the work of Nobel laureate Coase (1937) who was first to highlight the
</p>
<p>role of transaction costs. Transaction costs comprise the collection of information
</p>
<p>e.g. on the quality of the product or service to be traded, setting up contracts, and
</p>
<p>monitoring compliance with them. In the presence of low transaction costs, arms-
</p>
<p>length dealing through markets is efficient. Yet when transaction costs are substan-
</p>
<p>tial, performing transactions within a company rather than through markets may be
</p>
<p>more efficient. A famous example is putting together a team for producing a movie.
</p>
<p>The market solution would require every actor, every costume designer, and every
</p>
<p>2The value-creating units of vertically integrated companies are nowadays often organized as
</p>
<p>profit centers in order to prevent this disadvantage.

<p>grip to strike a contract with every other member of the team. The internal solution
</p>
<p>is for the director to be partner to all contracts, giving him a measure of command-
</p>
<p>and-control authority. Note that as long as vertically integrated companies remain
</p>
<p>in competition with each other, vertical integration is subject to the market test so
</p>
<p>may well be beneficial at both the microeconomic and the macroeconomic level. In
</p>
<p>the case of refining companies, there are at least two reasons for efficiency-driven
</p>
<p>vertical integration:
</p>
<p>&ndash; According to Williamson (1971), investments in refineries are asset-specific
</p>
<p>(also known as factor-specific investments), meaning that they cannot be used
</p>
<p>for anything else but processing crude oil. In addition, refineries crucially
</p>
<p>depend on a continuous supply of crude oil, making them vulnerable to a
</p>
<p>&lsquo;hold-up&rsquo; by oil extractors. Conversely, extracting companies would suffer
</p>
<p>from a &lsquo;hold-up&rsquo; by refineries as soon as they rely on pipelines for low-cost
</p>
<p>transportation. In this situation, vertical integration can be an efficient alternative
</p>
<p>because it reduces the supply risks confronting refineries while stabilizing sales
</p>
<p>and earnings at the extracting stage. This makes investment in a vertically
</p>
<p>integrated industry attractive.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Asymmetry of information between buyer and seller can be a problem calling for
</p>
<p>vertical integration. Usually, the seller knows more about the properties of the
</p>
<p>product than the buyer, who may have to undertake costly search for informa-
</p>
<p>tion. The buyer can avoid this cost by acquiring the seller, thus obtaining the
</p>
<p>right to inspect the product. During the early phase of the oil industry, asymmet-
</p>
<p>ric information was indeed a problem: The owner of an oil field had detailed
</p>
<p>knowledge about the quantity of oil in the ground, which the refinery operator
</p>
<p>lacked, being an outsider. However, a potential investor needed to have a reliable
</p>
<p>estimate of future supply in order to plan the refinery&rsquo;s capacity. The purchase of
</p>
<p>the oil field resolved this asymmetry of information.
</p>
<p>If highly asset-specific investment combines with risk in market transactions
</p>
<p>along the value chain, a tendency towards vertical integration is to be expected.
</p>
<p>However, this tendency hurts the economy in case it leads to &lsquo;downstream&rsquo; monop-
</p>
<p>olization to the detriment of final consumers. For small countries, it may be
</p>
<p>sufficient to keep markets open to foreign competition, exposing domestic
</p>
<p>producers to the threat of market entry by newcomers from the world market.
</p>
<p>However, these newcomers may be multinationals who have at least as much
</p>
<p>market power as their domestic competitors, calling for intervention by competition
</p>
<p>policy (Zweifel and Zäch 2003). In large countries like the United States, the world
</p>
<p>market may be dominated by its own domestic producers, creating a situation that
</p>
<p>cannot be resolved without government regulation designed to prevent the abuse of
</p>
<p>market power. In the case of the Standard Oil Company, application of the Sherman
</p>
<p>Act of 1890 (known as the Antitrust Act) led to an extremely severe intervention,
</p>
<p>i.e. the forced unbundling of the monopolist. While vertical integration continues to
</p>
<p>characterize the oil industry, a vertically integrated monopoly is no more possible.

<p>8.2.2 Global Oligopoly of Vertically Integrated Majors
</p>
<p>With the shift from kerosene lamps to electric light, the market initially targeted by
</p>
<p>refineries vanished. Yet by historical coincidence, the combustion engine (with the
</p>
<p>gasoline engine patented in 1876 and the diesel engine, in 1892) created a new and
</p>
<p>much larger market for crude oil and its products. However, motor cars consume
</p>
<p>substantially more energy than kerosene lamps, causing people to worry already at
</p>
<p>that time whether there would be sufficient crude oil in the face of mass motoriza-
</p>
<p>tion.3 With the discovery of large oil fields in Texas (in 1901) and in the Persian
</p>
<p>Gulf region (Iraq in 1904, Iran in 1908, and Saudi Arabia in 1921), these concerns
</p>
<p>vanished.
</p>
<p>As a consequence of this shift of supply to the Persian Gulf, the successors of the
</p>
<p>former Standard Oil Company had to expand their sourcing of crude oil in order to
</p>
<p>hold on to their market position. Internationally, they were competing with
</p>
<p>European companies such as BP and Royal Dutch/Shell, who had started their oil
</p>
<p>business in the colonies of their home countries. This globalization had the added
</p>
<p>benefit of permitting to shift profits within the vertically integrated organization
</p>
<p>towards tax jurisdictions offering favorable terms. In this context, internal transfer
</p>
<p>prices (also known as posted prices) can be used to e.g. overcharge services
</p>
<p>provided by headquarters to an extracting division operating in the Persian Gulf.
</p>
<p>This leads to a reduction of profits recorded there, resulting in a lowered overall tax
</p>
<p>burden, provided the home country (which can be a tax haven like the Bahamas)
</p>
<p>offers a lenient taxation of profits.
</p>
<p>By the 1920s, exploration of oil fields in the Persian Gulf exceeded growth in oil
</p>
<p>demand, leading to a fall in both the nominal and real price of crude (see Fig. 8.4).
</p>
<p>The U.S. Sherman Act of 1890 had created a new competitive environment which
</p>
<p>prevented the leading companies from individually controlling the market. In the
</p>
<p>aim of stopping the decline in oil prices, the three companies BP, Shell, and Exxon
</p>
<p>signed the Achnacarry Agreement in 1928, to be joined by Mobil, Gulf, Texaco,
</p>
<p>and Chevron later. This agreement froze the market shares of participating
</p>
<p>companies in all countries except the United States. A company who attracted
</p>
<p>additional customers was to share the extra demand with its competitors. Inevitably,
</p>
<p>the Achnacarry Agreement also froze market shares in the supply of crude. It
</p>
<p>constitutes a classic cartel designed to fix sales and production quotas. Also called
</p>
<p>the &lsquo;seven sisters&rsquo; because it comprised the seven oil majors, it was able to control
</p>
<p>the international oil market until the 1970s. In particular, it thwarted attempts by the
</p>
<p>governments of concession countries to appropriate a greater share of profits by
</p>
<p>threatening to move production somewhere else. It also staved off nationalization,
</p>
<p>the most famous example being the creation of the National Iranian Oil Company in
</p>
<p>1951 by Prime Minster Mosaddegh, who was ousted by a coup d&rsquo;état led by British
</p>
<p>3For example, representatives of the Detroit Board of Commerce voiced grave concerns about the
</p>
<p>future of crude oil supply at a 1906 Senate hearing in Washington DC.

<p>and U.S. intelligence agencies in 1953. From the viewpoint of the oil majors, their
</p>
<p>cartel was quite successful in keeping concession fees at a low level.
</p>
<p>At that time, there was no antitrust legislation in most countries, with the
</p>
<p>exception of the United States. Indeed, for strategic reasons the U.S. government
</p>
<p>even encouraged domestic oil companies to expand worldwide. It saw no reason to
</p>
<p>intervene against the cartel because the Achnacarry Agreement explicitly exempted
</p>
<p>the United States, thus complying with U.S. antitrust legislation. Governments of
</p>
<p>the remaining consumer countries had no incentive to intervene either, likely
</p>
<p>because they viewed &lsquo;their&rsquo; company as a conduit for transferring profits and
</p>
<p>hence tax revenue from producing countries. In fact, they benefited from a high
</p>
<p>import price, having started to tax gasoline in terms of a percentage levied on it.
</p>
<p>Economists maintain that no cartel can live forever without an effective enforce-
</p>
<p>ment mechanism (often the government) because each of its members has an
</p>
<p>incentive to chisel. The temptation to sell more by secretly granting a price
</p>
<p>reduction is strong because the agreed sales price is usually way above marginal
</p>
<p>cost. Yet in the case of the &lsquo;seven sisters&rsquo;, the challenge came from another cartel,
</p>
<p>the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC). This cartel became possible
</p>
<p>because governments of producer countries had achieved an increased degree of
</p>
<p>control over extraction (see Sect. 8.2.3).
</p>
<p>In the wake of oil field nationalizations after the Second World War, the amount
</p>
<p>of crude available to oil majors fell short of their refinery capacities (see Fig. 8.5).
</p>
<p>As a consequence, these companies had to purchase crude oil on the international
</p>
<p>market to keep their refineries running. This made high prices of crude oil a mixed
</p>
<p>blessing for them: On the one hand, they reaped windfall profits on production from
</p>
<p>the fields remaining under their control; on the other hand, they incurred increased
</p>
<p>costs for purchasing the extra crude. In addition, the companies found it increas-
</p>
<p>ingly difficult to obtain new concessions in countries with nationalized oil fields.

<p>While there were alternatives such as domestic offshore oil and enhanced oil
</p>
<p>recovery (mainly shale oil at present), they continued to be more costly than
</p>
<p>production in Persian Gulf region. A further challenge was that some
</p>
<p>oil-producing countries began to process crude oil on their own. This led to global
</p>
<p>refining overcapacities and decreasing refinery margins (see Sect. 8.1.5).
</p>
<p>As a reaction to these challenges, private oil companies went through a wave of
</p>
<p>mega mergers by the end of the 1990s (see Table 8.9). As their motivation, they
</p>
<p>stated cost reductions and synergy effects, especially through an integrated optimi-
</p>
<p>zation of refineries, logistics, and stocks. However, these mergers allowed the oil
</p>
<p>majors also to better control production capacities and oil flows, serving to boost
</p>
<p>their refinery margins and hence profits.
</p>
<p>8.2.3 The OPEC Cartel of Oil-Exporting Countries
</p>
<p>In September 1960, five countries (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and
</p>
<p>Venezuela) founded OPEC, the Organization of Petrol Exporting Countries. Its
</p>
<p>objective was to forge a joint monopoly that could set a sales price in excess of the

<p>competitive market price. However, a high price entails a reduced quantity sold;
</p>
<p>therefore, a cartel must allocate production quotas to its members. Yet in view of
</p>
<p>high profit margins, each member has an incentive to chisel, i.e. to secretly sell
</p>
<p>additional amounts at a reduced price, thus undermining the cartel.
</p>
<p>Over time, more countries joined OPEC: Qatar (1961), Indonesia4 (1962),
</p>
<p>Libya (1962), the United Arab Emirates (1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971),
</p>
<p>Ecuador5 (1973 and 2007), Gabon (1975) and Angola (2007). While these
</p>
<p>additions caused the market share of OPEC to increase during the 1960s (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.6), the member states were not able to capitalize on this development. This
</p>
<p>changed in 1970 when Libya and Algeria, two relatively small oil-producing
</p>
<p>countries, were able to negotiate higher concession fees with &lsquo;their&rsquo; private oil
</p>
<p>companies. They were successful for two reasons. First, the increase amounted to
</p>
<p>only 0.40 USD/bbl; second, the companies operating in these countries were not
</p>
<p>oil majors but relatively small companies without alternative production sites.
</p>
<p>The success of these two small OPEC member states shed a negative light on
</p>
<p>larger OPEC countries as well as on OPEC as a whole, who had obviously failed
</p>
<p>to take advantage of the cartel&rsquo;s potential. However, OPEC soon had the oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity to rectify this.

<p>concession fee (in the guise of the so-called posted price6) by a factor of five, to
</p>
<p>11.65 USD/bbl. This hike has become known as the first oil price shock. The oil
</p>
<p>majors were not able to shift their business elsewhere (North Sea, Alaska) in the
</p>
<p>short term. Therefore, OPEC did not lose market share until about 1977 (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.6).
</p>
<p>&ndash; The second oil price shock occurred in 1979, as a consequence of the Iranian
</p>
<p>Revolution (also known as Islamic Revolution). With Saudi Arabia already having
</p>
<p>cut oil production by 25%, the political turmoil in Iran exacerbated the shortage,
</p>
<p>pushing the crude oil price from about 10 USD/bbl to over 30 USD/bbl. This time
</p>
<p>OPEC lost one-half of its market share because the oil companies were better
</p>
<p>prepared to shift their sourcing away from the Persian Gulf, to the North Sea in
</p>
<p>particular. In early 1986, Saudi Arabia (who had been stabilizing the cartel by
</p>
<p>accepting falls in its quota) decided to defend its market share by letting price drop
</p>
<p>to below 20 USD/bbl (see Fig. 8.6). This caused the OPEC cartel to break apart.
</p>
<p>The two oil price shocks constitute the most important events of the twentieth
</p>
<p>century affecting the energy economy. They reflect the effectiveness of the OPEC
</p>
<p>cartel, who at least temporarily had acquired control over the global market for crude
</p>
<p>oil. Starting in 1982, OPEC countries had set extraction quotas that were compatible
</p>
<p>with a target price. Saudi Arabia, the OPEC country with the largest oil production by
</p>
<p>far, took on the role of the so-called swing producer by adjusting its production to
</p>
<p>achieve the desired price when other cartel members exceeded their quota. Between
</p>
<p>1986 and 1999, however, Saudi Arabia was no longer willing to accept chiseling. In
</p>
<p>1999 the quota system was reactivated in modified form. Semi-annual negotiated
</p>
<p>adjustments were replaced by an automatic adjustment if price (based on a basket of
</p>
<p>crudes sold by OPEC countries, the so-called OPEC basket) deviated from a defined
</p>
<p>range. This system has never come under pressure since 2004 because oil prices have
</p>
<p>been exceeding this range as OPEC countries lacked the capacities to meet the
</p>
<p>growing demand for oil in Asia, in particular China (see Fig. 8.6).
</p>
<p>To conclude, OPEC has been able to influence and at times even control the global
</p>
<p>oil market. However, it has repeatedly experienced periods of weakness. As with all
</p>
<p>cartels, its members have an incentive to violate the cartel agreement by selling more
</p>
<p>than their quota (at the high price secured by the cartel), unless there is an effective
</p>
<p>sanctioning mechanism. This lack of cooperation can be explained by a game
</p>
<p>theoretic model, the so-called prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma (this term reflects the fact that
</p>
<p>two accomplices would have to be dismissed for lack of evidence if they cooperated;
</p>
<p>yet each one has an incentive to tell on the other, striking a deal with police).
</p>
<p>Table 8.10 contains an illustrative example. For simplicity, OPEC is divided into
</p>
<p>two groups (Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC), each extracting 10 mn bbl/day. If
</p>
<p>6The posted price is the sales price set by the government of the exporting country, who uses it for
</p>
<p>calculating the tax to be paid by oil companies. If this tax rate is high, e.g. 80%, the posted price in
</p>
<p>fact determines the cost of crude to companies.
</p>
<p>178 8 Markets for Liquid Fuels</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>both parties cooperate, the cartel can achieve a price of 60 USD/bbl; if they fail to
</p>
<p>cooperate, the competitive price of 40 USD/bbl obtains. However, there is another
</p>
<p>possibility: One party cooperates by sticking to its quota, while the other party
</p>
<p>chisels by selling in excess of its quota at a lowered price. Assume that each party is
</p>
<p>able to take over 50% of the other party&rsquo;s demand if it lowers the price by
</p>
<p>10 USD/bbl to 50 USD/bbl. Then, its revenue equals 750 mn (&frac14; 50�15) USD/day,
whereas the cooperating party has revenues of only 300 mn (&frac14; 60�5) USD/day.
</p>
<p>The so-called payoff matrix shows the revenues accruing to Saudi Arabia and
</p>
<p>the rest of OPEC for the four combinations of strategies (see Table 8.10). Evidently,
</p>
<p>with 1200 mn (&frac14; 60�10 + 60�10) USD/day, cooperation maximizes the joint payoff,
while failure to cooperate minimizes it (800 mn &frac14; 40�10 + 40�10). However,
non-cooperation is profitable if the other party continues to cooperate, i.e. to stick
</p>
<p>to its quota. Therefore, each member of the cartel has an incentive to chisel,
</p>
<p>undermining the stability of the cartel.
</p>
<p>This example suggests that cartels are likely to be inherently unstable. 7 In the
</p>
<p>case of OPEC, cooperativeness is further challenged by the asymmetry
</p>
<p>characterizing its members. Countries with a small but wealthy population
</p>
<p>(e.g. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) are pitted against
</p>
<p>countries with a large and relatively poor population (e.g. Algeria, Iran, and Iraq).
</p>
<p>The governments of the second group typically rely on budgeted revenues from oil
</p>
<p>sales. This implies that they seek to sell more rather than less when the sales price
</p>
<p>drops (keeping &lsquo;price � quantity&rsquo; constant), which results in a supply function with
negative rather than positive slope. This puts high demands on cartel management
</p>
<p>by the first group, in particular Saudi Arabia (Griffin and Steele 1986, p. 141).
</p>
<p>The two oil shocks had a major impact on the economies of oil-importing countries
</p>
<p>(see Hickman et al. 1987). On the initiative of Henry Kissinger, the U.S. Secretary of
</p>
<p>State at the time, the industrial countries of the western world established the Paris-
</p>
<p>based International Energy Agency (IEA) in 1974. One of its missions has been the
</p>
<p>creation of stocks sufficient to cover oil demand for 90 days, to be released in case of
</p>
<p>emergency following a joint decision by all IEA member governments.
</p>
<p>Several governments have built up additional stocks of oil that are not part of the
</p>
<p>IEA crisis mechanism. One example is the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve whose
</p>
<p>use can be decided upon independently of other governments. From an economic
</p>
<p>perspective, state-controlled oil stocks amount to compulsory national insurance

<p>7Based on an evolutionary approach, Axelrod (1984) examines the conditions that make coopera-
</p>
<p>tion rather than non-cooperation the stable equilibrium outcome. One such condition is that
</p>
<p>participants expect a high (infinite) number of iterations of the game.

<p>against oil shocks. However, insurance coverage is known to induce so-called
</p>
<p>moral hazard. In the present context, it undermines preventive effort by private
</p>
<p>companies and consumers designed to deal with supply shortages. In fact, the
</p>
<p>amount of oil stocked by the private sector has significantly decreased with the
</p>
<p>introduction of state-owned stocks. Another problem is that governments may use
</p>
<p>oil stocks for other purposes than securing supply. In particular, some have released
</p>
<p>stocks in the past in order to reduce the price of oil products in an attempt to curry
</p>
<p>favor with voters at election time.
</p>
<p>8.2.4 State-Owned Oil Companies
</p>
<p>Nationalizations of private oil companies have a long history: Azerbaijan (1924),
</p>
<p>Mexico (1938), Romania (1948), Iran (1951-1953), Indonesia (1960), Algeria
</p>
<p>(1970), Libya (1971), Iraq (1972), Iran (1973), Venezuela (1975-1990), Canada
</p>
<p>(1975), Kuwait (1975), Saudi Arabia (1980), Venezuela (2004), Russia (2004), and
</p>
<p>Bolivia (2006) are just the most important cases.8 However, only two of the eight
</p>
<p>largest oil companies were state-owned in 1972. By 2000, the situation was
</p>
<p>reversed, with only two of the eight major companies being privately owned
</p>
<p>(ExxonMobil and Shell). The four so-called super majors (ExxonMobil, Shell,
</p>
<p>BP, and Total) account for no more than about 11% of global crude oil extraction.
</p>
<p>A new form of state control over crude oil markets thus originates in oil-consuming
</p>
<p>countries, whose state-owned companies have been more successful than the
</p>
<p>private oil majors in the acquisition of foreign oil concessions.
</p>
<p>In most countries, oil deposits, as well as deposits of other raw materials, are
</p>
<p>owned by the public sector, most often by central government. This also applies to
</p>
<p>offshore fields within the 200-mile economic zone. The transfer of extraction rights
</p>
<p>to private companies is based on extraction licenses or so-called concessions. In
</p>
<p>principle, governments are free to decide whom to award these licenses except that
</p>
<p>they have to respect international agreements, for example OECD norms regarding
</p>
<p>foreign direct investment or non-discrimination norms of the European Union.
</p>
<p>Whether the extraction of raw materials, notably crude oil, should be allocated to
</p>
<p>the private or the public sector has been hotly disputed since the nineteenth century.
</p>
<p>Yet there is an economic argument in favor of oil extraction by public companies,
</p>
<p>derived from so-called principal-agent theory. This theory revolves around a
</p>
<p>principal who hires a specialized agent whose effort it cannot observe, a situation
</p>
<p>which creates leeway for the agent to pursue its own interest. To a government
</p>
<p>acting as the principal, effort deployed and cost incurred by a private company (the
</p>
<p>agent) are indeed largely unobservable. Thus governments are exposed to the risk
</p>
<p>of opportunistic behavior on the part of e.g. private oil companies, a risk that cannot
</p>
<p>be entirely eliminated even by contracts of the most sophisticated type. Therefore it

<p>in private ownership.

<p>may be preferable for governments to directly control oil production through their
</p>
<p>own national oil company (whose effort is assumed to be open to inspection).
</p>
<p>Rosa (1993) has elaborated this argument further. His starting point is that &ldquo;(. . .)
</p>
<p>the rationale for nationalization is to be found in the basic business of politics, the
</p>
<p>transfer motive&rdquo; (Rosa 1993, p. 320). In order to appropriate the maximum amount
</p>
<p>of money from the oil industry, governments can tax extraction profits or national-
</p>
<p>ize the oil extraction business.9 Either way, they obtain most of the scarcity rent
</p>
<p>associated with an exhaustible resource (see Sect. 6.2.1). Their rational choice
</p>
<p>depends on the cost-benefit ratio of these two alternatives. Since these cost-benefit
</p>
<p>ratios vary over time, the optimal choice may also vary, which would explain the
</p>
<p>long historic waves of privatization and nationalization. In keeping with this line of
</p>
<p>thought, the propensity to nationalize oil extraction is predicted to increase if
</p>
<p>&ndash; scarcity rents increase, since this favors opportunistic behavior by private
</p>
<p>companies. According to Fig. 8.7, the revenues from oil exports (which reflect
</p>
<p>profits to a considerable extent because costs were far more stable) correspond
</p>
<p>closely with the two waves of nationalization in the 1970s and after 2000;
</p>
<p>&ndash; foreign oil companies act more aggressively to reduce their tax burden, causing
</p>
<p>income from profit taxation to fall;
</p>
<p>&ndash; the degree of corruptibility of public officials increases, since this also tends to
</p>
<p>decrease income from profit taxation;
</p>
<p>&ndash; the interest differential between private and public loans increases (given that it
</p>
<p>is positive) because interest payments by private oil companies lower their

<p>profits and hence tax payments while interest payments to former owners of
</p>
<p>nationalized resources become comparatively smaller;
</p>
<p>&ndash; tax collection becomes more costly due to an increase in tax evasion and fraud.
</p>
<p>Conversely, privatization becomes attractive if the government revenue
</p>
<p>generated by a national oil company falls short of the tax on profit attainable
</p>
<p>given that the company is privatized. Usually, this situation is the result of a high
</p>
<p>productivity gap between private and national oil companies. However, such a gap
</p>
<p>may in turn be caused by the fact that public companies pursue other goals than
</p>
<p>profit maximization (which goes along with high productivity). National oil
</p>
<p>companies may be used by government as a vehicle to reduce unemployment
</p>
<p>(through overstaffing) or to sell oil products to domestic consumers at below-
</p>
<p>market prices. Both measures correspond to the main business of government &ndash;
</p>
<p>transferring income and wealth to preferred voter groups (Hartley and Medlock
</p>
<p>2008).
</p>
<p>However, productivity gaps between private and public companies can be traced
</p>
<p>to other reasons, in particular a lack of innovativeness in state-owned firms. During
</p>
<p>periods of rapid innovation in the oil industry, the involvement of national oil
</p>
<p>companies in the extraction business tends to be harmful to the oil-producing
</p>
<p>country, motivating rational governments to privatize.10 Conversely, during periods
</p>
<p>of slow innovative change, governments are predicted to prefer state ownership.
</p>
<p>8.3 Oil Price Formation
</p>
<p>With the creation of national oil companies in the 1970s, the private oil majors
</p>
<p>ceased to be vertically integrated, with the inevitable consequence of a substantial
</p>
<p>expansion of international trade in oil. There are two types of traders on wholesale
</p>
<p>oil markets (see Fig. 8.5):
</p>
<p>&ndash; Companies with a long position (net suppliers) who dispose of more crude oil
</p>
<p>than they can refine and therefore have an excess of crude oil. Typical examples
</p>
<p>are national oil companies, who lack not only refining capacities but also access
</p>
<p>to consumer markets since most filling station networks continue to be con-
</p>
<p>trolled by the oil majors.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Companies with a short position (net demanders) who depend on crude oil
</p>
<p>purchases for utilizing their refining capacities and supplying their filling station
</p>
<p>networks. Typically, these are the oil majors, having lost many of their oil fields
</p>
<p>and extraction rights.
</p>
<p>10Without privatization, national oil companies can become dependent on the know-how of
</p>
<p>foreign private companies.
</p>
<p>182 8 Markets for Liquid Fuels</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This structure encourages the development of wholesale oil markets. One has to
</p>
<p>distinguish between spot markets (for physical delivery), forward markets (ulti-
</p>
<p>mately for physical delivery), and markets for financial derivatives. On spot
</p>
<p>markets, conclusion of the contract, delivery, and payment occur more or less
</p>
<p>simultaneously. In the case of the oil industry, settlement is somewhat delayed
</p>
<p>for logistical reasons but usually does not take more than 15 days. On forward
</p>
<p>markets, delivery and payment are due several months or even years after conclu-
</p>
<p>sion of the contract. Volumes and prices are fixed ahead of delivery, permitting the
</p>
<p>party less able to bear risk to shift the risk (of a price change in particular) to the
</p>
<p>party who is better able to bear it, e.g. because its activities are more diversified (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 12.2.5 for an analogous discussion of forward electricity markets). On deriva-
</p>
<p>tive markets, contracts relating to physical quantities rather than physical quantities
</p>
<p>themselves are traded, such as futures and options; accordingly, settlement is
</p>
<p>financial rather than physical. Derivative markets enable traders from outside the
</p>
<p>oil business, for example financial institutions, to participate.
</p>
<p>Another distinction is between contracts concluded on an energy exchange or
</p>
<p>outside an exchange (so-called over-the-counter contracts, OTC for short). The
</p>
<p>reason for using energy exchanges instead of OTC markets is counterparty risk.
</p>
<p>Each party to a contract is exposed to the risk that the counterparty defaults, for
</p>
<p>instance due to insolvency. While this risk increases with time until settlement, it is
</p>
<p>eliminated if the energy exchange becomes the counterparty to the contract. The
</p>
<p>exchange is better able to bear this risk because it administers a huge number of
</p>
<p>contracts, causing the likelihood of multiple defaults to be very small. Still,
</p>
<p>exchanges acting as clearing houses protect themselves against financial risk by
</p>
<p>asking their members to provide collateral and to adjust it to market developments
</p>
<p>(so-called marking to market). This is the &lsquo;price of the counterparty insurance&rsquo; and
</p>
<p>may amount to substantial transaction costs for traders. Another reason for using an
</p>
<p>energy exchange is anonymous trading; sellers and buyers do not need to know their
</p>
<p>counterparty.
</p>
<p>The most important crude oil exchanges are the New York Mercantile Exchange
</p>
<p>(NYMEX) and the International Commodity Exchange (ICE) in London (formerly
</p>
<p>International Petroleum Exchange). Each defines a so-called benchmark crude for
</p>
<p>describing product quality. For the U.S. market this is West Texas Intermediate
</p>
<p>(WTI) traded at Cushing; for Europe it is North Sea Brent. More recently, Dubai
</p>
<p>Crude has been established as the benchmark crude for the Persian Gulf (see Sect.
</p>
<p>8.1.1).
</p>
<p>8.3.1 Oil Spot Markets and the Efficient Market Hypothesis
</p>
<p>An important task of energy economists is to understand price developments on
</p>
<p>crude oil spot markets. According to the theory of efficient markets, the current spot
</p>
<p>price is the best possible forecast for the price of the following day (a so-called
</p>
<p>naı̈ve forecast). The reason is that price incorporates all information available to
</p>
<p>market participants without any delay, causing daily spot prices pt to follow a

</p>
<p>8.3.2 Long-Term Oil Price Forecasts and Scenarios
</p>
<p>Naı̈ve short-term price forecasts of the type presented in the preceding section are
</p>
<p>not satisfactory for an economic assessment of investments in the energy industry
</p>
<p>and for energy policy, which need to be based on long-term predictions. Accord-
</p>
<p>ingly, industry analysts (e.g. Prognoseforum in Germany), financial institutions
</p>
<p>(e.g. research divisions of commercial banks), research institutes (e.g. the Center
</p>
<p>for Global Energy Studies CGES), as well as public authorities (e.g. the Interna-
</p>
<p>tional Energy Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy) regularly publish long-
</p>
<p>term oil price forecasts and scenarios.
</p>
<p>Most commonly, they perform a so-called fundamental analysis, trying to
</p>
<p>predict future price developments by observing shifts in the supply of and demand
</p>
<p>for oil. Some factors influencing supply were mentioned in Sects. 6.2 and 8.2; at this
</p>
<p>point, a more comprehensive list of supply-side factors is presented.
</p>
<p>&ndash; According to economic theory, the marginal cost of the last oil field needed to
</p>
<p>meet demand constitutes the lower bound of the price of crude oil. Over time, oil
</p>
<p>fields are exhausted, calling for the development of new fields which usually
</p>
<p>have higher marginal cost, however. Thus the marginal cost of crude oil tends to
</p>
<p>increase over time. In 2003, the Swiss Investment Bank CSFB estimated the
</p>
<p>break-even cost of crude oil extraction at 17.60 USD/bbl. Eleven years later, it
</p>
<p>was much higher (see Fig. 8.2). This partly explains the increase in the price of
</p>
<p>crude oil that has occurred since 2003. On the other hand, technological change
</p>
<p>can lead to a fall in marginal cost. This was particularly relevant in the 1980s and
</p>
<p>1990s, contributing to a period of low oil prices (in real terms) between 1986
</p>
<p>and 1999.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Capacity utilization is another fundamental factor influencing price
</p>
<p>developments. When capacity utilization is low, an increase in the demand for
</p>
<p>oil can be met at little extra cost. In a market diagram, the supply schedule runs
</p>
<p>almost horizontal. When capacity utilization is high, extra demand can only be
</p>
<p>met by working overtime, working faster, and hiring more labor, all of which
</p>
<p>drives up marginal cost (in keeping with the adage, &lsquo;haste makes waste&rsquo;). The
</p>
<p>supply schedule has a steep slope, indicating that any increase in demand boosts
</p>
<p>price. On the longer run, capacity is adjusted, usually by bringing in new
</p>
<p>machinery that incorporates technological change and hence serves to lower
</p>
<p>marginal cost. The supply schedule shifts out, causing price to fall (provided

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>demand does not continue to increase). The result is a cyclical development of
</p>
<p>the price of crude.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Exploration and development of new oil fields may reinforce this cyclical pattern.
</p>
<p>The condition is that the new fields operate at the same or lower marginal cost as
</p>
<p>the existing ones, thus causing the supply schedule to shift out. Then, the cycle can
</p>
<p>be described as follows. At low capacity utilization and low demand, investment in
</p>
<p>new fields is unattractive (existing ones may even be abandoned). In this situation,
</p>
<p>a surge in demand causes the price of crude to rise. This triggers exploration effort,
</p>
<p>and with a lag of three to five years (Reynolds 2002), new discoveries result in an
</p>
<p>outward supply shift, which in turn exerts pressure on price.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Available extraction capacities are not only influenced by economic
</p>
<p>considerations but also by wars, political boycotts, strikes, and expectations of
</p>
<p>such events. Political risks therefore have an impact on crude oil prices.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Many analysts differentiate between capacity utilization in OPEC countries and
</p>
<p>in non-OPEC countries. In particular, large spare capacities in non-OPEC
</p>
<p>countries limit the potential of the OPEC cartel to increase oil prices. Con-
</p>
<p>versely, spare capacities in OPEC countries can be irrelevant if cartel discipline
</p>
<p>of OPEC members is strong.
</p>
<p>&ndash; More generally, the effectiveness of OPEC matters. It can vary greatly because
</p>
<p>the OPEC cartel is inherently unstable (see Sect. 8.2.3). Sometimes it can
</p>
<p>achieve a price markup over marginal cost, sometimes it cannot. Thus, analyzing
</p>
<p>the decision processes within OPEC, particularly during the bi-annual meetings
</p>
<p>of OPEC energy ministers, is part of fundamental analysis.
</p>
<p>&ndash; In the case of an exhaustible resource, self-fulfilling expectations may induce
</p>
<p>volatility in price (see Sect. 6.2.3). If market participants expect increasing prices
</p>
<p>for crude oil, their production decisions differ from a situation in which they
</p>
<p>expect decreasing prices. Important sources for such expectations are scientific
</p>
<p>studies and their rendition in the media, in particular business newspapers. Argu-
</p>
<p>ably the first oil price shock caused by the oil boycott of OPEC in 1973 was
</p>
<p>amplified by the influential study by Meadows et al. (1972) on the limits to
</p>
<p>growth. Also, the oil price increase after 2000 coincided with a public debate
</p>
<p>about peak oil. In both cases, crude oil was believed to be in short supply before
</p>
<p>long, providing a seemingly sound justification for its price to increase.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Prices of benchmark crudes are quoted at point of delivery. For WTI, this is
</p>
<p>Cushing, Oklahoma, for Brent it is the ports of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and
</p>
<p>Antwerp. In the latter case, cargo rates directly influence price; rates in turn
</p>
<p>depend on availability of tanker capacity, fuel cost, and risk along major shipping
</p>
<p>routes (geopolitical for the Strait of Hormuz, piracy for the Strait of Malacca).
</p>
<p>The most important demand-side factor for crude oil prices is growth of the
</p>
<p>global economy (see also Sect. 5.2). In order to empirically test this link, annual
</p>
<p>data on global economic growth rates published by the International Monetary
</p>
<p>Fund (IMF) can be used. A least-squares regression based on 24 observations
</p>
<p>covering the years 1990 to 2013 relates the relative changes in Brent spot prices
</p>
<p>pBrent (data source: BP) and global GDP growth rates. The regression result reads

<p>According to this estimation, global economic growth of 1% per year is
</p>
<p>associated with an increase in the Brent spot price increase of 12.5%, ceteris
</p>
<p>paribus. The ceteris paribus clause is important because market prices are deter-
</p>
<p>mined by demand and supply, whereas Eq. (8.3) focuses on a demand-side influ-
</p>
<p>ence only (for other influences, see below). Also, note that in the absence of growth
</p>
<p>(ΔGDP/GDP &frac14; 0), the equation predicts price to fall by 33%, likely due to the
supply-side influences discussed above. Finally, ΔGDP/GDP should be viewed as
</p>
<p>endogenous, reflecting the fact that an increase in the price of oil hampers growth in
</p>
<p>most of the world economy, while a decrease fosters it. Reassuringly however, an
</p>
<p>estimate linking relative changes in WTI spot prices to global GDP growth from
</p>
<p>1990 to 2005 yields comparable results, albeit with a more marked declining trend
</p>
<p>(Erdmann and Zweifel 2008, p. 202).
</p>
<p>There are other factors on the demand side that may influence the price of crude
</p>
<p>oil:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Quality requirements concerning oil products affect the structure of demand.
</p>
<p>Stricter environmental norms have served to increase demand for high-quality
</p>
<p>(sweet or low-sulfur, respectively) crudes relative to demand for low-quality
</p>
<p>(sour or high-sulfur) ones (see Sect. 8.1.1).
</p>
<p>&ndash; For several oil-consuming countries, demand for internationally traded oil is a
</p>
<p>net quantity because they have domestic supplies. For instance, the development
</p>
<p>of fracking has been reducing demand for imported oil by the United States (the
</p>
<p>country is even predicted to become a net exporter before long). This puts
</p>
<p>pressure on the price of internationally traded crude.
</p>
<p>Evidently, there is a multitude of factors influencing crude oil prices. Quite
</p>
<p>possibly, their relative importance is not constant over time, making fundamental
</p>
<p>analysis difficult. This also means that price forecasts derived from fundamental
</p>
<p>analysis are unlikely to be accurate. This consideration suggests scenario modeling
</p>
<p>as a more modest approach. Scenario modeling yields only conditional predictions
</p>
<p>reflecting varying assumptions concerning the future development of factors deter-
</p>
<p>mining the price of oil.
</p>
<p>Most of the published oil price scenarios are based on the concept of adaptive
</p>
<p>expectations11. Market participants are assumed to base their predictions on a linear
</p>
<p>combination of past prices and the currently observed price. By changing the

</p>
<p>scenarios which amount to an extrapolation of trends estimated in different ways
</p>
<p>(see also Sect. 5.3.2). As an example, Fig. 8.9 exhibits oil price forecasts published
</p>
<p>by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Forecasts are dashed lines showing
</p>
<p>future price paths predicted at the date of publication; actual price developments are
</p>
<p>represented by solid lines. As long as the existing price trend remains unchanged,
</p>
<p>these forecasts are relatively accurate. Yet whenever there is a change in trend,
</p>
<p>scenarios based on adaptive expectations can be seriously misleading.
</p>
<p>Changes in trend (also called structural breaks or regime shifts) occur only
</p>
<p>sporadically. They are attributed to factors that slowly reach or exceed a certain
</p>
<p>threshold value, when they suddenly become important. Non-linear systems theory
</p>
<p>has been the tool of choice for analyzing such regime shifts. An example of a &lsquo;slow&rsquo;
</p>
<p>variable is the change in the relative cost of production of different technologies.
</p>
<p>Evidently, the condition for a regime shift is met if the cost of production using an
</p>
<p>alternative technology falls below the cost of the conventional alternative. How-
</p>
<p>ever, this does not lead to massive investment in the new technology right away. In
</p>
<p>the case of fracking, factors causing delay were concerns about a future drop in the
</p>
<p>sales price of crude, environmental risks, and government intervention protecting
</p>
<p>incumbent players and technologies. Yet with a continuing or even increasing cost
</p>
<p>advantage of the new extraction technology, the regime shift cannot be halted.
</p>
<p>The upper panel of Fig. 8.10 shows the succession of technologies in U.S. oil
</p>
<p>extraction since 1900. The first oil price shock of 1973 fostered investment in
</p>
<p>technology suitable for offshore extraction, the second of 1979/80, in technologies
</p>
<p>suitable for the retrieval of unconventional crudes, notably fracking. As argued
</p>
<p>above, the introduction of a new extraction technology causes a surge in supply
</p>
<p>which puts pressure on price for a few years. The lower panel of Fig. 8.10 displays

<p>the cascade-like development of price in a stylized way. It reflects the expectation
</p>
<p>that by 2035, biofuels and coal liquefaction may well cease a spike in oil price
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.3.3 Prices of Crude Oil Futures
</p>
<p>Once liquid spot markets for benchmark crudes are established, markets for
</p>
<p>derivatives can develop. The most important derivatives are oil futures traded on
</p>
<p>energy exchanges. Futures are standardized contracts (1000 bbl of a benchmark crude)
</p>
<p>to be settled at standard delivery times (middle of the month) at a price agreed upon in
</p>
<p>advance. While settlement in terms of physical quantities is possible, financial settle-
</p>
<p>ment is more common. In this case, the difference between the spot price observed on
</p>
<p>the exercise day (the price of the so-called underlying) and the price of the future is
</p>
<p>paid. If the spot price exceeds the price agreed upon in the future, the buyer of the
</p>
<p>contract receives the price difference from the exchange while the seller has to pay this
</p>
<p>difference to the exchange. If the spot price is below the future price, the buyer of the
</p>
<p>contract has to make up for the difference while the seller receives it.
</p>
<p>The standard example is the operator of a refinery with excess capacity. One
</p>
<p>alternative is to buy crude oil on the spot market and to keep it in storage for use
</p>
<p>months later. This strategy comes with the so-called cost of carry which comprises
</p>
<p>cost of storage and insurance as well as forgone interest on the capital tied
</p>
<p>up. Alternatively, the operator can buy a future contract with the appropriate
</p>
<p>maturity T. As long the two alternatives differ in terms of cost, there is scope for
</p>
<p>arbitrage which can be used by the refinery operator to reduce its cost of sourcing.
</p>
<p>Conversely, if no scope for arbitrage exists at trading date t, the market is in
</p>
<p>equilibrium, which implies the following relationship between spot price pt and
</p>
<p>future price pF,t(T ) (Kaldor 1939; Hull 1999),
</p>
<p>pF, t T&eth; &THORN; &frac14; pt � e i&thorn;c&eth; &THORN; T�t&eth; &THORN;: &eth;8:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>Thus, the price of the forward contract must equal the spot price accrued for
</p>
<p>interest i and cost of carry c during (T-t) time periods. Provided c is constant,
</p>
<p>Eq. (8.4) represents a cointegration equation of degree one, which means that the
</p>
<p>two time series, ( pF,t, t &frac14; 1,...) and ( pt, t &frac14; 1,...), cannot permanently diverge.12
From Eq. (8.4), one therefore has
</p>
<p>lim
t!T
</p>
<p>pF, t T&eth; &THORN; &frac14; pt &eth;8:5&THORN;
</p>
<p>pF, t0 T&eth; &THORN; &gt; pF, t1 T&eth; &THORN; &gt; pt for t1 &gt; t &eth;8:6&THORN;
</p>
<p>The no-arbitrage conditions predict four things. In view of Eq. (8.4), (i) the
</p>
<p>future price should increase over time as long as the spot price increases ceteris
</p>
<p>paribus; (ii) according to Eq. (8.5), the price of a forward contract with given
</p>
<p>maturity T should approach the spot price as time t goes on; (iii) the forward price
</p>
<p>should always exceed the spot price in view of inequality (8.6); and (iv) this excess
</p>
<p>12If arbitrage exists, arbitrageurs can perform risk-free trades. Their role can therefore be com-
</p>
<p>pared to that of the error correction term in cointegration models.

<p>should decrease over time since the difference (T-t) goes to zero, again in view of
</p>
<p>inequality (8.6).
</p>
<p>Figure 8.11 displays so-called forward curves for contracts with a given matu-
</p>
<p>rity. The data confirm prediction (i) in that the forward curves shift up in response to
</p>
<p>increases in the spot price. They also confirm prediction (ii) until 2002 in that
</p>
<p>forward prices indeed approach spot prices as time goes on, causing t to approach T.
</p>
<p>The forward curves are said to be in contango during this period. However, more
</p>
<p>recently a tendency towards convergence cannot be observed anymore; the forward
</p>
<p>curves are said to be in backwardation. As to prediction (iii), it is not vindicated
</p>
<p>because the majority of forward curves runs consistently below the spot price.
</p>
<p>Moreover, given that they are above the spot price, the excess often fails to decrease
</p>
<p>as time goes on, contrary to prediction (iv).
</p>
<p>During periods of backwardation, futures with late maturity are cheaper than
</p>
<p>those with early maturity, indicating that the cost of holding a physical stock
</p>
<p>decreases rather than increases with time to maturity (T-t). The solution has been
</p>
<p>to complement Eq. (8.4) with a so-called convenience yield cywhich may dominate
</p>
<p>the cost of carry c,
</p>
<p>pF, t T&eth; &THORN; &frac14; pt � e i&thorn;c�cy&eth; &THORN; T�t&eth; &THORN;: &eth;8:7&THORN;
</p>
<p>The convenience yield could be due to the flexibility in use afforded by a stock
</p>
<p>of crude prior during time to maturity. While cy is constant in Eq. (8.7), Fig. 8.11
</p>
<p>suggests it varies over time. Thus, this modification of the no-arbitrage condition
</p>
<p>(8.4) remains unsatisfactory as long as the convenience yield is not related to its
</p>
<p>determinants.
</p>
<p>This challenge is taken up by the theory of normal backwardation (Hicks 1939,
</p>
<p>pp. 135&ndash;140), which explains the shape of the forward curve by a demand for

<p>hedging price risks which may differ between sellers and buyers and vary over time.
</p>
<p>In contango, buyers who seek to hedge their short positions dominate, while in
</p>
<p>backwardation, they are the sellers who want to hedge their long positions. The
</p>
<p>theory of backwardation is further explained in Sect. 12.2.5, where it is applied to
</p>
<p>the markets for electricity.
</p>
<p>Another approach to explaining the development of price on the market for oil
</p>
<p>futures starts from the observation that the daily volume of derivatives traded (the
</p>
<p>so-called paper market) is 30&ndash;40 times bigger than the worldwide annual con-
</p>
<p>sumption of oil (the so-called wet market). This gives rise to the suspicion that in
</p>
<p>addition to fundamental market conditions, financial speculation might play
</p>
<p>a role.
</p>
<p>For an analysis of speculative effects on price, backwardation and contango
</p>
<p>situations need to be considered separately. In the case of backwardation,
</p>
<p>speculators are predicted to purchase contracts with maturities far in the future
</p>
<p>(because they are cheap, see Fig. 8.11 again) while selling contracts with short-term
</p>
<p>maturities. As time goes on, contracts with long-term maturities become higher-
</p>
<p>valued contracts with short-termmaturities. This strategy is profitable provided spot
</p>
<p>market prices do not fall (which would make a spot purchase an even better
</p>
<p>alternative). By way of contrast, in the case of contango arbitrage between short-
</p>
<p>term and long-term futures does not yield profits. The reason is that in contango it
</p>
<p>would be attractive to purchase contracts with short-term maturities before they
</p>
<p>become more expensive (see Fig. 8.11). However, as time goes on, these contracts
</p>
<p>cannot turn into higher-valued contracts with long-term maturity. The consequence
</p>
<p>of this behavior is that in backwardation, speculators buy up a lot of futures in the
</p>
<p>paper market, which serves to reduce quantities available on the wet market and
</p>
<p>hence to drive up spot prices. Conversely, in contango speculators stay away from
</p>
<p>the paper market, thus leaving supply to the wet market, which in turn causes spot
</p>
<p>prices to remain stable or even fall.
</p>
<p>Indeed, between 2002 and 2006 (a period of backwardation), an inflow of
</p>
<p>financial capital into the derivative oil market amounting to at least 100 bn USD
</p>
<p>was reported by The Washington Post. This inflow may well have contributed to the
</p>
<p>increase in the spot price of crude from 30 to more than 60 USD/bbl in 2006.
</p>
<p>Likewise, the sudden outflow of financial capital in the autumn of 2008 may explain
</p>
<p>the drop to 40 USD/bbl in that same year.13
</p>
<p>8.3.4 Wholesale Prices of Oil Products
</p>
<p>As a first approximation, the wholesale price of an oil product is the sum of the
</p>
<p>crude oil price (i.e. the purchase price paid by refineries) and the cost plus margin of
</p>
<p>13Oil prices need not to fall if speculative capital is withdrawn from oil markets. Rather, traders
</p>
<p>with an interest in holding physical quantities of oil may step in to replenish their stocks. It
</p>
<p>therefore may take some time for an oil price bubble to burst.

<p>the refinery. In the literature, the spread margin is distinguished from the cash
</p>
<p>margin when quantifying refinery margins. The spread margin refers to the differ-
</p>
<p>ence between the sales price of the oil product and the purchase price of the crude; it
</p>
<p>is transparent because it can be calculated from publicly accessible price data. The
</p>
<p>cash margin results from the difference between the revenue from selling the
</p>
<p>product and the cost of production. Its calculation requires knowledge of refineries&rsquo;
</p>
<p>cost of operation which is not available to outsiders.
</p>
<p>In view of the range of refinery products and their prices, the calculation of the
</p>
<p>spread is also complicated, calling for simplifying assumptions. The following
</p>
<p>formula is often used for estimating the so-called crack spread of refineries,
</p>
<p>Crack Spread &frac14; 2 � pgasoline &thorn; pfuel oil
� �
</p>
<p>=3� pcrude: &eth;8:8&THORN;
</p>
<p>In keeping with U.S. market conditions, the price of gasoline is weighted double
</p>
<p>relative to the price of heating oil (which includes diesel). Since prices need to be
</p>
<p>per unit energy for aggregation, the price of gasoline pgasoline, heating oil pheatingoil,
</p>
<p>and crude oil pcrudeoil are converted to a common reference unit using their heating
</p>
<p>values (e.g. barrels of crude oil equivalent; see Table 8.1).
</p>
<p>Figure 8.12 shows the crack spreads of U.S. and European refineries since 1993.
</p>
<p>Before 2000, the global refinery industry was characterized by large overcapacities
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 8.5). Once these overcapacities disappeared, the crack spread increased
</p>
<p>sharply. It is unlikely to return to its former levels since the refinery industry is
</p>
<p>heavily concentrated in most countries, facilitating collusion. In addition, barriers
</p>
<p>to entry are high for newcomers.
</p>
<p>While crude oil prices and refinery margins do not display a seasonal pattern,

<p>there is one for refinery products, at least in the U.S. market. Summer is the driving

<p>season, during which gasoline prices are high relative to heating oil prices.14Winter
</p>
<p>is the heating season, during which heating oil is expensive compared to gasoline.
</p>
<p>This pattern is confirmed by an ordinary least-squares regression based on weekly
</p>
<p>observations in the United States covering the years 2001 to 2014. The dependent
</p>
<p>variable is the ratio of prices for gasoline and heating oil; the explanatory variables
</p>
<p>are a seasonal term (represented by the cosine function), the available stocks of
</p>
<p>gasoline and heating oil, respectively, and a time trend that increases by one unit per
</p>
<p>week. The estimation result reads

<p>The t-statistics below the estimated parameters indicate that all coefficients are
</p>
<p>statistically significant, while the coefficient of determination R2 &frac14; 0.62 indicates
good statistical fit. However, the Durbin-Watson statistic DW&frac14; 0.08 points to a high
degree of positive serial correlation between residuals. Therefore, when the predicted
</p>
<p>value of the price ratio exceeds the observed one for a given week, it is likely to be too
</p>
<p>high again in the following week. This lack of independence over time causes the
</p>
<p>standard errors of the coefficients to be underestimated and hence their t-statistics to be
</p>
<p>overestimated. It often reflects a neglect of additional explanatory variables, which in
</p>
<p>turn may result in biased parameter estimates.
</p>
<p>With these reservations in mind, it can be concluded from the constant that
</p>
<p>gasoline would be 30% more expensive than heating oil, were it not for the other
</p>
<p>influences. One of them is seasonality, reflected by the highly significant coeffi-
</p>
<p>cient of the cosine function. Another are stocks: Large stocks of heating oil
</p>
<p>depress its price and hence make gasoline more expensive relative to heating
</p>
<p>oil, while large stocks of gasoline serve to make gasoline cheaper relative to
</p>
<p>heating oil. Note that these stocks likely are endogenous in that they are held in
</p>
<p>view of expected sales prices (which in turn depend on current ones, as argued in
</p>
<p>Sect. 8.3.3). Finally, the time trend indicates that the price of gasoline declines
</p>
<p>over time relative to the price of heating oil. Ceteris paribus, the decrease is from
</p>
<p>1.300 to 1.299 one year later (�0.001 &frac14; �0.0099�52/52), reflecting the steady
replacement of ordinary gasoline by premium qualities with higher heating values
</p>
<p>during the observation period.

</p>
<p>outliers. An estimate based on weekly data from 2001 and 2006 and more advanced

<p>Markets for Gaseous Fuels 9
</p>
<p>This chapter discusses markets for natural gas, biogas, and hydrogen. While the
</p>
<p>markets for biogas and hydrogen are still in their infancy, natural gas ranks third
</p>
<p>globally among primary energy sources (after crude oil and hard coal). One of its
</p>
<p>advantages are technologies with high fuel efficiencies which release relatively
</p>
<p>little carbon dioxide (CO2). Another advantage is the fact that existing infrastruc-
</p>
<p>ture can be used for distributing gas from new, unconventional reserves. On the
</p>
<p>other hand, its transportation calls for a capital-intensive and geographically inflex-
</p>
<p>ible network of pipelines which cannot be used for other purposes and is therefore
</p>
<p>factor-specific. This raises several questions concerning the properties of natural
</p>
<p>gas markets:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Are pipeline investments economically viable without long-term contracts?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Can market liquidity for gas be achieved without abolishing long-term
</p>
<p>contracts?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How can supply be secured in the absence of long-term contracts?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Is vertical integration along the value chain economically beneficial or not?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Can liquid natural gas (LNG) play the role of a game changer, making consum-
</p>
<p>ing countries less dependent on suppliers with monopoly power and political
</p>
<p>clout?
</p>
<p>In many regions of the world, the highly seasonal demand for space heating
</p>
<p>determines the sales of natural gas. As gas customers usually lack storage
</p>
<p>capacities, deliveries by suppliers must track demand closely. This raises further
</p>
<p>questions that will be discussed in this chapter:
</p>
<p>&ndash; How can volatile demand be met?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What role could gas storage capacities play?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Regarding the potential for substitution between natural gas and heating oil,
</p>
<p>what are the implications for retail gas pricing?

<p>9.1 Gaseous Fuels and Gas Infrastructures
</p>
<p>Gaseous energy sources consist mostly of oxidizable substances, in particular
</p>
<p>methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2). The energy content of a cubic meter depends
</p>
<p>not only on the chemical composition of the gas but also on pressure and tempera-
</p>
<p>ture. This follows from the formula for an ideal gas,
</p>
<p>P V
</p>
<p>ϑ
&frac14; constant &eth;2:7&THORN;
</p>
<p>with P symbolizing pressure, V volume, and ϑ temperature measured in degrees
</p>
<p>Kelvin (see Sect. 2.2.2).
</p>
<p>For the purpose of standardization, the lower and upper heating values of a
</p>
<p>normal cubic meter Nm3 of gases are measured at a pressure of 1.013 bar and a
</p>
<p>temperature of 0 �C, alternatively 15 �C.Whatever its chemical composition, 1 Nm3
</p>
<p>of gas always contains 44,614 gas molecules. International gas statistics use a
</p>
<p>variety of units. Therefore the conversion factors shown in Table 9.1 can be helpful.
</p>
<p>They are based on natural gas with a lower heating value of 10.4 kWh/Nm3.

<p>9.1.1 Properties of Gaseous Fuels
</p>
<p>Table 9.2 presents an overview of the most important chemical components of
</p>
<p>gaseous energy sources, including inert gases devoid of a thermal contribution, such
</p>
<p>as oxygen and nitrogen.1 Evidently, types of natural gas differ widely both in terms
</p>
<p>of density and heating values. Those containing a great deal of propane and butane
</p>
<p>are particularly valuable ceteris paribus because these components combine high
</p>
<p>density and high heating values, which serve to keep the cost of transportation,
</p>
<p>distribution, and storage low.
</p>
<p>The following commercial products can be distinguished.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Natural gas: This type of gas has a high share of low-density methane. In
</p>
<p>Northwestern Europe, one distinguishes between low-energy natural gas
</p>
<p>(L gas, with an upper heating value between 8.4 and 11.6 kWh/m3, or 30.2
</p>
<p>and 41.8 MJ/m3, respectively) and high-energy natural gas (H gas, with an upper
</p>
<p>heating value between 10.2 and 13.1 kWh/m3, or 36.7 and 47.2 MJ/m3, respec-
</p>
<p>tively). Some types contain amounts of hydrogen sulfide (so-called sour gas)
</p>
<p>which may cause damage to the infrastructure. Since gas is invisible and
</p>
<p>odorless by nature, it is mixed with tetrahydrothiophene before distribution for
</p>
<p>detecting leakages, giving it an unpleasant odor.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Liquid gas (also known as refinery gas): This type consists mainly of propane
</p>
<p>and butane, which are byproducts of oil refinery processes (see Sect. 8.1.5).
</p>
<p>Contrary to other components, propane and butane are heavier than air, which is
</p>
<p>an advantage for some uses. While gaseous at normal temperature and pressure,
</p>
<p>they can be liquefied using moderate pressure and sold in pressure bottles.

<p>&ndash; Town gas (also called cooking gas) is a byproduct of coke plants. It consists
</p>
<p>mostly of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO). This gas is lighter than air
</p>
<p>and toxic due to its CO content.
</p>
<p>Conditioning plants are used to modify gases by adding inert or liquid gas in
</p>
<p>order to attain certain quality standards. This can also be necessary for ensuring
</p>
<p>interoperability of different pipeline systems, a precondition for physical gas trade.
</p>
<p>Compared to other hydrocarbons, storage of gaseous energy fuels is costly due to
</p>
<p>their comparatively low energy density (see Table 9.3). Even at a pressure of
</p>
<p>200 bar, the volumetric energy content of natural gas is only 156 kg/m3, i.e. some
</p>
<p>20% of gasoline (see compressed natural gas CNG). Higher storage densities are
</p>
<p>achieved if the natural gas is cooled down to become liquid (LNG). However,
</p>
<p>hydrogen is even worse: At a pressure of 700 bar, a hydrogen tank contains 56 kg/m
3, i.e. only 7% of the energy contained by a gasoline tank of comparable size.
</p>
<p>9.1.2 Reserves and Extraction of Natural Gas
</p>
<p>According to Table 9.4, the static range of conventional natural gas reserves
</p>
<p>amounts to 67 (&frac14;185.7/2.763) years worldwide. While this value exceeds that of
crude oil, this is an advantage that will be offset by expected growth of gas demand.
</p>
<p>Like conventional crude oil, conventional gas reserves are concentrated in the
</p>
<p>&lsquo;energy ellipse&rsquo; extending from Siberia to the Middle East.

<p>In addition to conventional reserves, several unconventional sources of natural
</p>
<p>gas exist, among them shale gas, coal bed methane, and methane hydrates. Cur-
</p>
<p>rently, the most relevant unconventional gas resource is shale gas. Shale is a fine-
</p>
<p>grained sedimentary rock that can readily be split into thin pieces along its
</p>
<p>laminations. Methane trapped in shale formations is recovered using advanced
</p>
<p>extraction technologies known as fracking. According to 2014 estimates of the
</p>
<p>German Federal Office of Geo Science and Resources (BGR 2014), global shale gas
</p>
<p>resources amount to 210 tn m3 of methane. Coal bed methane is extracted by
</p>
<p>drilling wells into the coal seam and pumping water from the well. The concomitant
</p>
<p>decrease in pressure allows methane to escape from the coal and to flow up the well
</p>
<p>to the surface. Finally, methane hydrates are a solid energy source found in ocean

<p>160 m3 methane gas per m3 hydrate.
</p>
<p>Table 9.4 also reports rates of extraction of usable natural gas2 according to
</p>
<p>geographical region. At present, the United States account for more than 20% of
</p>
<p>global gas extraction, making it the largest gas producer worldwide, whereas its
</p>
<p>estimated share of conventional reserves amounts to a mere 5%. Conversely, the
</p>
<p>countries of the &lsquo;energy ellipse&rsquo; have a market share of less than 40% but control
</p>
<p>more than 71% of reserves. However, shares in extraction have changed substan-
</p>
<p>tially since 2000. From that year, the U.S. share grew by 40% while that of the
</p>
<p>European Union fell by 37%, a consequence of its resistance to fracking. Since
</p>
<p>natural gas might be associated with crude oil deposits and be exploited together
</p>
<p>with them, some oil majors are also trading on gas markets. However, due to
</p>
<p>missing pipeline infrastructures, not all of this so-called associated gas can be
</p>
<p>used commercially at present.
</p>
<p>Similar to crude oil extraction, state concessions are needed in most countries
</p>
<p>(except in the United States) to exploit gas fields. In market-oriented economies,
</p>
<p>these concessions are allocated mainly to private companies through auctions. In
</p>
<p>most &lsquo;energy ellipse&rsquo; countries, companies cannot purchase concessions unless
</p>
<p>majority-controlled by the government of the state where the deposit is located.
</p>
<p>This is an obstacle for companies who seek to vertically integrate the upstream parts
</p>
<p>of the value chain (so-called backward integration; see Sect. 9.2).
</p>
<p>9.1.3 Biogas and Renewable Natural Gas
</p>
<p>Biogas derives from the fermentation of biomass, whose output is a vapor-saturated
</p>
<p>mix of methane (40&ndash;75%) and carbon dioxide (25&ndash;50%) with some ammonia and
</p>
<p>hydrogen sulfide. Due to its high CO2 share, it has a lower energy content than
</p>
<p>natural gas (see Table 9.2). Biogas escapes continually and unchecked from
</p>
<p>landfills, sewage plants, and liquid manure. If captured and used in combustion, it
</p>
<p>serves to mitigate the greenhouse gas problem since unburned methane has a
</p>
<p>greenhouse effect which exceeds that of CO2 by a factor of about 21.
</p>
<p>However, the typical sources of biogas are limited. Thus, renewable raw
</p>
<p>materials from agriculture, in particular maize, are used in combination with liquid
</p>
<p>manure and food waste as feedstock.3 One hectare of farmland can provide 4.5 tons
</p>
<p>of maize per year. With an output of 180 m3 gas per ton of maize and a methane
</p>
<p>content of 55%, the biogas return per hectare (ha) is about 450 m3. McKendry
</p>
<p>(2002) estimates the energy harvest at 2 GJ, or a mere 554 kWh per ha and year,
</p>
<p>respectively. Evidently, producing energy from agricultural products claims a great
</p>
<p>deal of agricultural land that could be used for food production. In regions with
</p>
<p>2The data exclude natural gas which is flared or reinjected into gas deposits.
3Nearly all biomass can be fermented, with the exception of lignin.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>excess supply of food like the European Union, this is no cause for concern at
</p>
<p>present. Indeed, the European Union is about to cut back its set-aside program in
</p>
<p>agriculture, which creates scope for subsidizing this type of fuel (currently at the
</p>
<p>rate of 45 EUR per ha and year). However, producing biogas from renewable
</p>
<p>biomass is quite costly. While it can be obtained from landfills, sewage plants,
</p>
<p>and liquid manure at a cost of 0.03&ndash;0.05 EUR/kWh, it costs between 0.06 and 0.08
</p>
<p>EUR/kWh if obtained from maize (at a price of 30 EUR/tons). The latter range is
</p>
<p>beyond that of natural gas, which is between 0.03 and 0.05 EUR/kWh.
</p>
<p>This comparison still neglects the fact that biogas production units are located in
</p>
<p>rural areas close to maize fields since transporting maize more than 20 km is usually
</p>
<p>uneconomic. This means that input quantities are limited, resulting in plant output
</p>
<p>capacities below 250 m3/h, too small for economies of scale. In the absence of a gas
</p>
<p>transport infrastructure, biogas must be burned on the production site, notably as a
</p>
<p>fuel for combined heat and power stations. Yet the electrical efficiency of these
</p>
<p>stations is usually below 40%. Moreover, the energy needed for fertilizing and
</p>
<p>harvesting the maize fields has to be taken into account.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, biogas may be upgraded to attain the chemical and physical
</p>
<p>properties of natural gas, enabling it to be fed into local distribution grids (at a
</p>
<p>pressure of 5&ndash;8 bar) or into long-distance gas pipelines. This makes biogas a
</p>
<p>(mostly) renewable substitute of natural gas which can be sold on all types of gas
</p>
<p>markets in principle. To distinguish it from natural gas, it is labeled &lsquo;bio methane&rsquo;
</p>
<p>or &lsquo;bio natural gas&rsquo;, respectively. Of course, quality upgrading, compression, and
</p>
<p>gas grid access result in additional costs. Currently bio methane exceeds the
</p>
<p>European natural gas wholesale price by a factor of three to four. A discrepancy
</p>
<p>of this amount is unlikely to vanish anytime soon because there is no prospect of a
</p>
<p>higher price of natural gas or a lower unit cost of biogas, respectively.
</p>
<p>Yet for farmers, biogas or bio methane constitutes an attractive option if amply
</p>
<p>subsidized. One the one hand, they can generate additional revenue from selling the
</p>
<p>fuel or from renting the farm land to biogas producers. On the other hand, they can
</p>
<p>count on higher sales prices for food, which becomes scarcer. In fact, farmers have
</p>
<p>the option of offering their production on both the market for food and energy
</p>
<p>markets, wherever the profit margin is higher. To the extent that the cost of
</p>
<p>production is similar, they will supply the market that offers the higher price. The
</p>
<p>economic conclusion is that with an important biogas production, food prices will
</p>
<p>follow the price of natural gas or the biogas price guaranteed by the government
</p>
<p>through its subsidy, respectively. This causes the two prices to become cointegrated
</p>
<p>(see Sect. 8.3.2).
</p>
<p>9.1.4 Hydrogen
</p>
<p>In terms of energy systems, hydrogen (H2) is a secondary fuel that does not exist on
</p>
<p>the globe as an accessible energy source, despite the fact that it is assumed to be the
</p>
<p>most common element in the universe. This is the consequence of its low density
</p>
<p>(see Table 9.2) and extreme dissipation. Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists as a

<p>chemically fixed component of molecules, for example water (H2O) or methane
</p>
<p>(CH4).
</p>
<p>Hydrogen can be produced from practically any primary energy source. At
</p>
<p>present, hydrogen is mostly produced using natural gas through a two-step process
</p>
<p>with an overall fuel efficiency between 65 and 75%,
</p>
<p>Steam reforming CH4&thorn;H2O ! CO&thorn; 3 H2 endothermic process&eth; &THORN;
Shift reaction CO&thorn; H2O ! CO2&thorn;H2 exothermic process&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>Another relevant technology is the electrolytic separation of water (H2O) to
</p>
<p>become hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O). This process requires electricity as an
</p>
<p>energy input and attains energy efficiencies between 70 and 80%. However, since
</p>
<p>electricity is much more expensive than natural gas, electrolysis is usually too
</p>
<p>costly for applications at market scale. To the extent that it can accommodate the
</p>
<p>intermittent nature of wind and photovoltaic energy, it does offer a way to render
</p>
<p>renewable electricity storable. Thus, so-called &lsquo;renewable hydrogen&rsquo; is widely seen
</p>
<p>as a key element of future carbon-free energy systems. It could be used in transpor-
</p>
<p>tation (through fuel cells) or to produce electricity (through fuel cells or gas
</p>
<p>turbines), on demand. Yet these options will only become economically viable if
</p>
<p>inexpensive renewable electricity is available. Failing this, engagement by the
</p>
<p>private sector continues to be limited, with investment projects predominantly
</p>
<p>financed by government research and development programs.
</p>
<p>At present, the global hydrogen production amounts to 500 to 600 bn m3 or
</p>
<p>120 mn tons per year, respectively. It is used in the following ways,
</p>
<p>&ndash; Ammoniac synthesis (60&ndash;70% share);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Refineries (hydro cracking, 15&ndash;25% share);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Methanol synthesis (8% share).
</p>
<p>Hydrogen is mostly used by chemical companies, who also produce
</p>
<p>it. Therefore, there is no liquid market providing reliable price information. Whole-
</p>
<p>sale prices of around 10 EUR per kg of compressed hydrogen (at 350 bar), are
</p>
<p>reported in the literature, which represents an energy content of about 120 MJ or
</p>
<p>33 kWh, respectively (see Table 9.2).
</p>
<p>9.2 Natural Gas Economy
</p>
<p>Historically, the natural gas industry is older than the oil industry because the first
</p>
<p>natural gas deposit was used as early as 1825 in the New York City area. However,
</p>
<p>until the 1950s exploration efforts were limited since natural gas was found
</p>
<p>alongside crude oil (so-called associated natural gas). Another source was town
</p>
<p>gas, a byproduct of coke plants which triggered investment in urban gas grids.
</p>
<p>These local grids created the opportunity for the building of long-distance pipelines
</p>
<p>connecting them to large-scale natural gas deposits.
</p>
<p>204 9 Markets for Gaseous Fuels</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In Europe, this process began later than in the United States, around 1970. The
</p>
<p>starting shot was the development of the huge Groningen gas field in the
</p>
<p>Netherlands, located quite closely to already existent local gas markets. Within a
</p>
<p>short period of time, additional high-pressure pipeline connections to gas fields in
</p>
<p>Western Siberia (Russia), the North Sea (Norway and the United Kingdom), and
</p>
<p>North Africa (Algeria, Tunisia) were built, along with LNG terminals on the shores
</p>
<p>of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, within 30 years quite
</p>
<p>a comprehensive infrastructure was established as the physical backbone of
</p>
<p>European gas markets.
</p>
<p>9.2.1 Transport by Pipeline
</p>
<p>High-pressure pipelines are used to transport natural gas over long distances. At a
</p>
<p>pressure of up to 80 bar, and with a diameter of 1200 mm, they cover up to 6000
</p>
<p>km. Investment outlay varies between 0.5 and 1.5 mn EUR/km, depending on local
</p>
<p>conditions.
</p>
<p>A single 80 bar pipeline is able to transport up to 3 mn m3/h (or 26 bn m3/a,
</p>
<p>respectively) of natural gas at a speed of up to 40 km/h. As an approximation, the
</p>
<p>throughput rateQ depends on pressures P1 at the beginning of a pipeline section and
</p>
<p>P2 at the end of it. With length of section l and pipeline diameter d, throughput is
</p>
<p>proportional to
</p>
<p>Qe

</p>
<p>l=d2
:
</p>
<p>s
</p>
<p>&eth;9:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>Therefore, given a required pressure P2 at the point of delivery, throughput is the
</p>
<p>greater the higher initial pressure P1, the shorter the distance to be covered l, and the
</p>
<p>bigger the diameter of the pipeline d. Compressor stations designed to compensate
</p>
<p>pressure losses (0.1 bar per 10 km) and to keep the gas flowing are placed at
</p>
<p>intervals ranging between 80 and 400 km.4 They contain turbines that usually take
</p>
<p>their energy from the pipeline, consuming about 10% of the gas over a distance of
</p>
<p>5000 km. This requirement declines with the diameter and the quality of the tube.
</p>
<p>At least during the early stages of gas infrastructure development, the transport
</p>
<p>capacity of a high-pressure pipeline tends to exceed both the market potential and
</p>
<p>the financial capacity of a single gas company. However, pipelines exhibit
</p>
<p>economies of scale (see Knieps 2002): When capacity is doubled, cost of construc-
</p>
<p>tion increases by two-third only.
</p>
<p>The solution could be for several companies to build and operate a pipeline in
</p>
<p>co-ownership despite the fact that they are competitors in the markets where the
</p>
<p>pipeline originates and/or where it ends (so-called pipe-in-pipe competition). Yet
</p>
<p>4The pressure in a pipeline declines primarily due to frictional losses. In addition, it needs to be
</p>
<p>managed if elevation changes.
</p>
<p>9.2 Natural Gas Economy 205</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>companies may sooner or later extend their cooperation beyond the operation of the
</p>
<p>pipeline to form a cartel fixing prices in the purchasing and/or sales markets. This
</p>
<p>risk can be avoided through ownership unbundling, requiring the owners of the
</p>
<p>pipeline to be independent of other companies along the value chain. However,
</p>
<p>experience shows that companies that are prevented from freely using an asset
</p>
<p>costing several bn of EUR are unwilling to make the investment.
</p>
<p>Once a long-distance pipeline has been built, the capital expenditure is mostly
</p>
<p>sunk, i.e. it is lost unless the pipeline can be put to profitable use. A pipeline thus
</p>
<p>constitutes a factor-specific asset in that it can only be used for long-distance gas
</p>
<p>transport between the beginning and the end of the line and nothing else. Therefore,
</p>
<p>its owner must make sure there are customers at both ends who are willing to pay
</p>
<p>for transporting the gas.
</p>
<p>In general terms, investors are in a strong strategic position vis-à-vis customers
</p>
<p>and governments before the start of the project but in a weak one after its comple-
</p>
<p>tion because they cannot easily defeat opportunistic behavior on the part of their
</p>
<p>contractual partners. This situation is known in the economic literature as the
</p>
<p>&lsquo;holdup problem&rsquo;. It can be solved by vertical integration, which however is in
</p>
<p>conflict with the requirement of unbundling cited above.
</p>
<p>Absent vertical integration, investment and pricing behavior of two market
</p>
<p>participants with monopoly power in the pertinent market along the gas value
</p>
<p>chain needs to be analyzed. The usual approach is to formulate a two-stage game
</p>
<p>theoretical model. In its first stage, a monopolistic producer of natural gas decides
</p>
<p>about the optimal capital stock K reflecting the capacity of a planned pipeline. In the
</p>
<p>second stage, the producer and a gas importer, who has a monopoly over distribu-
</p>
<p>tion to final customers, have to agree on the import price pimp(K ) which is the
</p>
<p>producer&rsquo;s sales price. The outcome of this negotiation depends on pipeline capac-
</p>
<p>ity, which is also denoted by K for simplicity.
</p>
<p>Since the producer rationally anticipates the import price when deciding about
</p>
<p>investment resulting in capital stock K, the model is solved in reverse order
</p>
<p>(so-called backward induction). Therefore, the outcome of the negotiation
</p>
<p>concerning the import price is determined first, assuming that both players seek
</p>
<p>to maximize profit independently of each other, resulting in a so-called Nash
</p>
<p>equilibrium (an equilibrium pertaining to a non-cooperative game).
</p>
<p>On the part of the importer, it has to take into account that a higher retail price
</p>
<p>pretail reduces the volume Q of gas sales. For simplicity, a linear demand function is
</p>
<p>posited,
</p>
<p>Q &frac14; a� pretail: &eth;9:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here, a denotes marginal willingness to pay for the first unit of natural gas, which is
</p>
<p>the maximum price consumers are willing to pay (to see this, setQ&frac14; 0 and solve for
pretail).
</p>
<p>Neglecting other costs the importer may incur (for distribution in particular), its
</p>
<p>profit Πimp is related to the sales price pretail and the import price pimp paid as
</p>
<p>follows,

</p>
<p>Since pretail is the variable controlled by the importer, the profit function (9.3) needs
</p>
<p>to be differentiated with respect to pretail for obtaining the first-order optimality
</p>
<p>condition. Also, given the optimal sales price, the optimal quantity sold and
</p>
<p>imported Q &frac14; Qimp is determined as well. Setting the derivative of (9.3) with

<p>This equation points to an interesting fact. The importing company cannot pass
</p>
<p>on an eventual increase in the import price fully to its customers. In the case of a
</p>
<p>linear demand function, the degree of pass-through is 50%. The reason is that a
</p>
<p>higher degree of pass-through would cause sales to fall to an extent that results in a
</p>
<p>reduced profit. From Eq. (9.4), one can calculate the importer&rsquo;s maximum profit,

<p>which depends on the import price to be paid,

<p>Turning to the producer of the natural gas, assume that it seeks to maximize its

<p>profit, too, knowing the importer&rsquo;s demand function and hence optimal Q*imp. With
</p>
<p>c(K ) symbolizing unit cost of extracting and transporting gas (which depends on

</p>
<p>Since the quantity deliveredQ

<p>variable left to the producer is the sales price pimp. If c(K ) is independent of the
</p>
<p>produced quantity Q &frac14; Q*imp and thus from price pimp, the first-order optimality
condition of the profit function calls for setting the derivative of (9.6) with respect
</p>
<p>to pimp to zero. Doing this yields the optimal import price p*imp (* indicating now

<p>Equations (9.4), (9.7), and (9.8) characterize a Nash equilibrium, defined as a

</p>
<p>both are optimizing on the premise that the other is optimizing as well, see Tirole
</p>
<p>1988, Chap. 11).
</p>
<p>An interesting conclusion can be drawn if the pipeline operator and the gas
</p>
<p>distributor are assumed to cooperate. This means that they maximize their joint

<p>profit, given by

</p>
<p>in view of Eq. (9.4) and the inequality in (9.7). Therefore, the retail price given
</p>
<p>cooperation is below the one in the non-cooperative situation. This means that a
</p>
<p>welfare loss results if two monopolistic companies along a value chain do not
</p>
<p>cooperate. The reason is so-called double marginalization: The monopolistic pro-
</p>
<p>ducer opts for a quantity of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost
</p>
<p>rather than where sales price equals marginal cost. This leads to a sales price above
</p>
<p>marginal cost [see Eqs. (1.3) and (1.4) in Sect. 1.2.2]. However, this sales price
</p>
<p>constitutes the marginal cost of the monopolistic importer, who again imposes
</p>
<p>equality of marginal revenue and marginal cost. This accumulation of surcharges
</p>
<p>over marginal cost is called double marginalization. It can be avoided by coopera-
</p>
<p>tion (or vertical integration, see below) because now the two parties share an
</p>
<p>interest in keeping marginal cost as low as possible in order to maximize their
</p>
<p>joint profit. Therefore, retail price pretail and hence market volume Q are higher
</p>
<p>given cooperation than given non-cooperation, benefitting consumers.
</p>
<p>At the same time, joint profit given cooperation exceeds the sum of profits of two

<p>Thus, the amazing conclusion is that both customers and companies benefit from
</p>
<p>cooperation since avoiding double marginalization is to the advantage of both. Note
</p>
<p>that the ultimate form of cooperation is vertical integration, i.e. a merger of the two
</p>
<p>companies, who become one. From the welfare point of view, this would be
</p>
<p>superior to a non-cooperative industry structure, ceteris paribus. However, one
</p>
<p>downside is so-called foreclosure, meaning that a newcomer in the distribution
</p>
<p>market (say) cannot compete against the incumbent monopolist because there is no
</p>
<p>natural gas available outside the vertically integrated value chain.
</p>
<p>Now that the second stage has a solution, the first stage can be solved. Here, the
</p>
<p>pipeline operator decides the optimal capital stock K in view of the optimal
</p>
<p>quantities determined in the second stage of the game. The Nash equilibrium
</p>
<p>implies that the two companies agree on the optimal import price p*imp according
</p>
<p>to Eq. (9.7) once the pipeline is finished. Assume that the unit cost c(K ) of natural
</p>
<p>gas production and transportation (in the exporting country) declines with the

<p>amount invested, but at a decreasing rate,5

</p>
<p>Also, let ic denote capital user cost per unit, which itself may be a function of
</p>
<p>K [see Sect. 3.1, Eq. (3.7)]. Then, by Eq. (9.8) the owner of the pipeline determines

: &eth;9:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>However, the social optimum would call for the maximization of consumer
</p>
<p>surplus, given by the triangular area below the demand function (9.2) net of
</p>
<p>marginal cost c(K). Also, fixed cost must be covered because otherwise the pipeline

</p>
<p>Obviously the two optimization problems have different solutions: Under the
</p>
<p>non-cooperative Nash equilibrium, the pipeline operator earns only 50% of the
</p>
<p>contribution margin that would be socially optimal. This weakened incentive
</p>
<p>translates into an investment in capacity that is too small. One could say that in
</p>
<p>the light of the two-stage theoretical model, failure to cooperate reduces the security
</p>
<p>of gas supply in the importing country (which among other things depends on the
</p>
<p>capacity of the transportation network).
</p>
<p>5While implying that returns to scale are exhausted sooner or later, this assumption guarantees the

<p>existence of a single equilibrium.

<p>Note that there are other approaches than vertical integration to solve the holdup
</p>
<p>problem. One alternative is for the gas producer and the distributor to establish a
</p>
<p>joint subsidiary that is responsible for investment in and operation of the pipeline.
</p>
<p>This subsidiary could even be open to competitors on both sides, although presum-
</p>
<p>ably on terms defined by its owners. Therefore, foreclosure would be mitigated but
</p>
<p>not eliminated. Other options are long-term contracts struck between the two
</p>
<p>companies in which a price prior to the undertaking of the investment in the
</p>
<p>pipeline is fixed (see Sect. 9.3.1).
</p>
<p>A variant of the holdup problem is linked with gas pipelines that transit a third
</p>
<p>country. Once built, they cannot be rerouted. This lack of flexibility gives
</p>
<p>governments of transit countries scope for opportunistically appropriating part of
</p>
<p>the exporter&rsquo;s profit. This problem can also be formulated in terms of
</p>
<p>non-cooperative game theory (see Hirschhausen et al. 2005). The model considers
</p>

<p>pany could raise its fee to tr � pimp &ndash; cprod, leaving just a minimum profit to the

<p>ctransit � tr � pimp � cprod: &eth;9:19&THORN;

<p>where the bounds specified in (9.19) must be satisfied. Because of κ &lt; 0, the optimal

</p>
<p>the export company.
</p>
<p>This model was complemented by Zweifel et al. (2009/10) in several ways. With
</p>
<p>the breakdown of the former Soviet Union in 1990, two transit countries, Ukraine
</p>
<p>and Belarus, became independent. The loss of control over the (now Ukrainian and
</p>
<p>Belarussian) pipelines caused the bargaining position of the Russian exporting
</p>
<p>monopolist Gazprom to be weakened. This means that cooperative game theory
</p>
<p>needs to be used for predicting whether Russia (who is part of all possible
</p>
<p>coalitions) teams up with Belarus, Ukraine, or both of them. Moreover, their
</p>
<p>relative bargaining power can be determined by calculating the so-called Shapley
</p>
<p>and Banshaf values (which reflect a player&rsquo;s contribution to the coalitions&rsquo; total
</p>
<p>profit in slightly different ways). As could be expected, in 2004 Russia had the
</p>
<p>highest bargaining power, followed by Ukraine due to its relatively high transit
</p>
<p>capacity, and Belarus. With the opening of the North Transit pipeline (and even
</p>
<p>more so if the planned Yamal pipelines were to be built), the dominance of Russia is
</p>
<p>predicted to become even more marked in future, mainly to the detriment of
</p>
<p>Ukraine.
</p>
<p>The conditional payoffs determined in the non-cooperative module lead to the
</p>
<p>prediction that the all-inclusive coalition will form because it generates maximum
</p>
<p>profit, while the cooperative module predicts that the lion&rsquo;s share of profit goes to
</p>
<p>Russia (who can use part of it to buy the participation of Belarus and Ukraine).
</p>
<p>However, all of these results are conditioned on an aggregate demand function
</p>
<p>characterizing Western Europe. With the advent of fracking and the possibility of
</p>
<p>liquefied natural gas being imported from the United States, this demand function
</p>
<p>may soon shift inward as far as Russian gas is concerned.
</p>
<p>9.2.2 LNG Transport and Trade
</p>
<p>An alternative to long-distance transport by pipeline is seaborne liquefied natural
</p>
<p>gas (LNG) trade. The LNG technology was developed for Japanese gas imports as
</p>
<p>this country cannot be supplied through pipelines still today. It has also been used
</p>
<p>for European gas imports from North Africa and the Middle East. The technology is
</p>
<p>complex and usually expensive compared to pipelines. A standard LNG chain has a
</p>
<p>capacity of 3.5 to 4.8 bn tons/a (4.8 &times; 6.6 bn m3/a, respectively) and consists of the
</p>
<p>following elements (Cayrade 2004).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Liquefaction plant in the export harbor: When cooled to &times;163 oC, gas turns
</p>
<p>liquid, causing its volume to be reduced by a factor of 580. Investment outlay
</p>
<p>on a plant amounts to about 900 mn EUR. At 0.04 EUR per m3 of natural gas,
</p>
<p>operating expenses need to be accounted for as well.
</p>
<p>9.2 Natural Gas Economy 211</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ndash; Fleet of LNG vessels: Being special purpose, these vessels constitute factor-
</p>
<p>specific capital (see Sect. 9.1.2 for the consequences). LNG transport from Port
</p>
<p>Said in Egypt to Cartagena in Spain over a distance of 2700 km may serve as an
</p>
<p>example. It is performed by two vessels with a capacity of 135,000 tons each,
</p>
<p>requiring an investment of about 360 mn EUR. One trip takes 10.5 days, at a cost
</p>
<p>of about 0.014 EUR per m3 of natural gas.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Regasification plant including LNG storage: In Cartagena, three storage tanks
</p>
<p>with a capacity of 80,000 m3 each are available. The investment outlay
</p>
<p>amounted to 320 mn EUR. The LNG is transformed into gas again at a cost of
</p>
<p>about 0.015 EUR per m3 of natural gas.
</p>
<p>An additional cost component of LNG derives from the fact that operation of the
</p>
<p>LNG chain requires about one-third of the energy contained in the gas that is
</p>
<p>delivered to the pipeline of the importing country. At a total unit cost of some
</p>
<p>0.06 USD per m3 of natural gas, LNG cannot compete with pipeline gas in many
</p>
<p>locations, depending on the length of the haul. According to Fig. 9.1, transporting
</p>
<p>natural gas through a pipeline is much more costly than transporting crude oil to
</p>
<p>begin with, especially when using a very large crude carrier. Moving gas from an
</p>
<p>offshore deposit in particular is so expensive that the LNG alternative becomes
</p>
<p>competitive beyond a distance of less than 2000 km; if the deposit is onshore, the
</p>
<p>critical distance increases to almost 3000 km.6 However, this may change in future

<p>6This comparison is flawed, however, as LNG vessels may have to travel longer distances around
</p>
<p>continents while pipelines can use the direct path. This difference does not obtain if deep oceans
</p>
<p>have to be crossed. Yet pipelines have not been competing against the LNG chain across deep

<p>oceans up to present.

<p>because the unit cost of LNG is likely to fall thanks to improvement in the design of
</p>
<p>liquefaction and regasification plants.
</p>
<p>In 2013, about 30% of natural gas was traded internationally. While this share
</p>
<p>has been increasing over many years, the share of international LNG trade has been
</p>
<p>growing even faster, from 27% in 2003 to more than 30% by 2013. The growing
</p>
<p>importance of LNG on global gas markets has several reasons:
</p>
<p>&ndash; The LNG chain allows developing remote natural gas fields that cannot be
</p>
<p>connected by pipelines for geographical, geological, political, or economic
</p>
<p>reasons.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Since gas fields close to consumers have the highest scarcity rents, they are
</p>
<p>developed prior to more remote gas fields (see Sect. 6.2.3).Yet when they are
</p>
<p>exhausted, more remote fields need to be developed for meeting demand, and
</p>
<p>according to Fig. 9.1 this improves the relative competitiveness of LNG.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Compared to pipeline projects, the LNG chain is more flexible. While a pipeline
</p>
<p>is operational no sooner than the entire project is finished, capacities along the
</p>
<p>LNG chain can be used even if the chain is not yet complete. This serves to
</p>
<p>reduce the economic impact of project delays and operational disruptions com-
</p>
<p>pared to pipelines. This advantage becomes more important as the number of
</p>
<p>LNG installations is increasing globally, reflecting a so-called positive network
</p>
<p>externality.
</p>
<p>&ndash; For both gas producers and consumers, LNG offers a chance for diversification,
</p>
<p>which mitigates the holdup problem associated with pipeline projects.
</p>
<p>With international LNG trade, regional gas markets become more integrated. In
</p>
<p>its absence, gas prices on both sides of the Atlantic would develop quite indepen-
</p>
<p>dently from each other because there is no scope for arbitrage. While LNG export
</p>
<p>and import capacities cause natural gas prices to converge, convergence is not
</p>
<p>perfect due to the substantial cost of operating the LNG chain.
</p>
<p>9.3 Gas Markets and Gas Price Formation
</p>
<p>As in the case of the oil industry, wholesale gas markets are characterized by two
</p>
<p>types of companies:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Gas producers such as state-owned Gazprom, Sonatrach, and Statoil as well as
</p>
<p>private companies such as BP, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, Shell, and Total
</p>
<p>usually have supplies in excess of demand at the prevailing market price&mdash;they
</p>
<p>are long in gas.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Gas importers and distribution companies such as E.ON, GdF, Wingas, ENI, and
</p>
<p>Tokyo Gas seek to meet a demand in excess of their own production at the
</p>
<p>prevailing market price&mdash;they are short in gas.
</p>
<p>9.3 Gas Markets and Gas Price Formation 213</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_6">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_6</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As long as the two types of companies are not vertically integrated, they need to
</p>
<p>trade gas in order to close their long and short positions, respectively. As shown
</p>
<p>below, there is a choice of design options for this wholesale trade.
</p>
<p>9.3.1 Long-Term Take-or-Pay Contracts
</p>
<p>Until recently, long-term take-or-pay contracts (ToP contracts) between producers
</p>
<p>and domestic importers of natural gas have dominated gas wholesale markets,
</p>
<p>particularly in Europe. These contracts used to have durations of 15 to 30 years.
</p>
<p>They make the importing company pay at least some 90% of the contracted gas
</p>
<p>even if its imports fall short of it because of reduced demand, e.g. due to a mild
</p>
<p>winter or an economic recession. The contracted price derives from a sliding-price
</p>
<p>formula that usually is based on the price of heating oil.7 A typical long-term
</p>
<p>contract may use the so-called &lsquo;6/3/3 rule&rsquo;, according to which the gas price
</p>
<p>depends on the six month average of the heating oil price, calculated with a lag
</p>
<p>of three months and applicable to deliveries over the following three months.
</p>
<p>For a long time, the German Federal Office of Foreign Trade (Bundesamt f&euro;ur
</p>
<p>Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle BAFA) has been publishing monthly gas border
</p>
<p>prices (solid line in Fig. 9.2). A simple ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimation
</p>
<p>explains the gas border price using a single independent variable, the monthly
</p>
<p>heating oil price along the Rhine river (in EUR/100 l; data source: German Federal
</p>
<p>Statistical Office),

</p>
<p>&eth;9:21&THORN;
</p>
<p>(t statistics in parentheses). The variable pHEL,t-3-k symbolizes the price of heating
</p>
<p>oil extra light, averaged over six months and lagged by three months, thus reflecting
</p>
<p>the popular sliding-price formula. For the 132 monthly observations from 2000 to
</p>
<p>2010, this regression explains more than 98% of the variance of the gas border price
</p>
<p>(see the dotted line in Fig. 9.2).8 However, an extrapolation of Eq. (9.21) beyond
</p>
<p>2010 does not perform as well (see the light dotted line of Fig. 9.2). Simulated
</p>
<p>prices exceed actual ones by up to 10 EUR/MWh, indicating that the era of stable
</p>
<p>long-term ToP contracts has come to an end, at least in Continental Europe.
</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, long-term contracts are an imperfect substitute
</p>
<p>of vertical integration; they are typically signed if vertical integration is prohibited.
</p>
<p>7Some long-term contracts use other pricing factors, e.g., the wholesale prices of heavy oil or coal.
</p>
<p>Such arrangements are designed to keep gas competitive in power generation.
8As both time series are cointegrated of degree one, a cointegration equation should be estimated.
</p>
<p>The pertinent methodology is explained in Sect. 9.3.2: however, it does not affect estimation
</p>
<p>results in the present case.

<p>Note that they allocate risk in a particular way: The exporter bears the price risk,
</p>
<p>while the importer bears the quantity risk. Economic theory predicts that risk is
</p>
<p>allocated to the party who is better able to bear it. This gives rise to the question of
</p>
<p>why the exporter can manage the price risk better than the importer, while the
</p>
<p>importer can manage the volume risk better than the exporter.
</p>
<p>&ndash; As to the importers, they usually make distributors accept a sliding-price for-
</p>
<p>mula as well. This is possible because gas distributors are mainly active in the
</p>
<p>market for space heating, where they compete with heating oil. A substantial
</p>
<p>markup on the price of heating oil would lead to a loss of sales.9 In addition,
</p>
<p>many gas consumers are risk averse, causing them to value the assurance that the
</p>
<p>retail price of gas will always track that of heating oil, albeit with a lag according
</p>
<p>to Eq. (9.21) that may provoke public anger. Finally, gas importers can deal with
</p>
<p>the quantity risk by investing in gas storage facilities, which are necessary at any
</p>
<p>rate to balance seasonal fluctuations in demand.
</p>
<p>&ndash; As to the gas exporters, they would run into problems if they had to bear both the
</p>
<p>price and the quantity risk because this would undermine the willingness of
</p>
<p>banks and financial institutions to provide the necessary loans for financing
</p>
<p>pipeline projects. Elimination of the quantity risk can be seen as contributing
</p>
<p>towards a minimum return on investment.

<p>9Distributors charge a so-called gas netback price which contains a markup on their purchase
</p>
<p>price. This markup is stable as long as the prices of gas and heating oil move in parallel. Due to the
</p>
<p>advantages of natural gas in terms of cleanliness and comfort, a certain markup over heating oil
</p>
<p>can be enforced in retail markets.
</p>
<p>9.3 Gas Markets and Gas Price Formation 215</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Despite of their economic advantages, long-term contracts are viable only if both
</p>
<p>parties credibly commit to their obligations over an extended period of time.
</p>
<p>Concerning the export company, credibility importantly hinges on sufficient gas
</p>
<p>reserves. Concerning the import company, the determinants of its long-term credi-
</p>
<p>bility are less obvious, in particular if they lose their political protection and
</p>
<p>become exposed to competition. It is not surprising that the duration of long-term
</p>
<p>contracts has significantly shortened since 1997, when the liberalized European
</p>
<p>single gas market was created (see Neumann and Hirschhausen 2004).
</p>
<p>The binding force of long-term contracts has been a topic in economics for some
</p>
<p>time. According to Crocker and Masten (1985, 1991), it should be effective to the
</p>
<p>extent that neither party has an interest in a premature termination of the contract
</p>
<p>unless this would be socially efficient. Thus, contractual penalties (inherent in ToP
</p>
<p>clauses) should be designed in a way that no party has an incentive to breach the
</p>
<p>contract if this would be socially inefficient.
</p>
<p>Long-term contracts are viewed more critically by competition theory. The basic
</p>
<p>argument is that they lack transparency, reduce the liquidity of spot markets, and
</p>
<p>constitute a barrier to entry for new competitors. In addition, the price formula
</p>
<p>applied may not be flexible enough to accommodate new developments, e.g. the use
</p>
<p>of natural gas in combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT) for power generation in the
</p>
<p>present context. Finally, linking the price of gas to the one of heating oil not only
</p>
<p>creates an avoidable cluster risk but also prevents gas from becoming an instrument
</p>
<p>of risk diversification. These considerations have led the Commission of the
</p>
<p>European Union to adopt a negative attitude towards long-term contracts, even
</p>
<p>while recognizing their contribution to the security of energy supply (EU Directive
</p>
<p>2003/55/EC).
</p>
<p>9.3.2 Natural Gas Spot Trade
</p>
<p>Another and more advanced market design is physical gas trade on spot and futures
</p>
<p>markets, first introduced in the United States (since 1978) and in Great Britain
</p>
<p>(since 1993). Liquid markets have evolved, generating transparent price signals.
</p>
<p>Finally, liberalization of European electricity markets around the year 2000 (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 12.2.2) created impetus to the development of liquid gas markets in Conti-
</p>
<p>nental Europe as well.
</p>
<p>However, physical gas trade is impossible unless traders can access the gas
</p>
<p>infrastructure (pipelines, LNG terminals), which is typically controlled by monop-
</p>
<p>olistic companies. Third parties need to obtain access to this infrastructure for a
</p>
<p>market place to exist where gas can be exchanged between traders. Two types of
</p>
<p>gas exchanges have developed so far.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Physical gas hubs: These are locations where pipelines, storage facilities, and
</p>
<p>liquefaction terminals meet like the spokes of a wheel, enabling the exchange of
</p>
<p>gas delivered though different pipelines. Pipelines that can be operated in both
</p>
<p>directions are particularly advantageous. An independent hub operator is called
</p>
<p>216 9 Markets for Gaseous Fuels</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_12">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_12</a></div>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>for who provides non-discriminating access and processing of transactions,
</p>
<p>evens out short-term physical imbalances, and publishes market prices in timely
</p>
<p>manner. The first physical gas hub worldwide was the Henry Hub, located close
</p>
<p>to the gas fields of Louisiana and Texas in the southern United Sates. It is the
</p>
<p>most important to this day. Its liquidity derives from 14 gas pipelines which
</p>
<p>come together there, connecting large parts of the country. The Henry Hub gas
</p>
<p>price (quoted in USD per mn BTU) has become the benchmark for the entire
</p>
<p>U.S. wholesale gas market. It also provides the reference price for gas futures
</p>
<p>traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX. In Continental Europe,
</p>
<p>the number one physical gas hub is located in Belgium, near Zeebrugge.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Virtual gas hubs: Since there are few places in the world with a concentration of
</p>
<p>pipelines qualifying them for serving as a physical gas hub, parts of a high-
</p>
<p>pressure pipeline grid may constitute an alternative. The market place is defined
</p>
<p>by a number of entry and exit points, where traders can feed in and take out gas,
</p>
<p>to be delivered to final consumers. Since the pipelines may be owned by
</p>
<p>different companies, an independent hub operator is again necessary who
</p>
<p>coordinates entry and exit rights, processes transactions, and charges entry and
</p>
<p>exit fees which are used to finance the infrastructure. Trades must be executed in
</p>
<p>a timely manner as traders do not have the right to use the grid for storing their
</p>
<p>gas. The first virtual gas hubs were established in Great Britain (National
</p>
<p>Balancing Point NBP) and in the Netherlands (Title Transfer Facility TTF). In
</p>
<p>the meantime, there are also virtual gas hubs in Belgium (ZEE), France (Points
</p>
<p>d&rsquo;Echange de Gaz, comprising Peg North, Peg South, and Peg TIGF), Germany
</p>
<p>(NetConnect Germany, Gaspool), and Italy (Punto di Scambio Virtuale).
</p>
<p>The spot market price of an active and liquid gas hub10 can become the reference
</p>
<p>price for gas contracts, serving to sever the link between long-term gas contracts
</p>
<p>and the heating oil price. This happened in Continental Europe around the year
</p>
<p>2011 (see Fig. 9.2). However, the two prices are unlikely to diverge a great deal
</p>
<p>because heating oil and natural gas are close substitutes in the market for space
</p>
<p>heating. Moreover, fuel switching is facilitated by bivalent burners which can use
</p>
<p>either fuel. In fact a strong correlation between the two prices is observed on the
</p>
<p>U.S. gas market where price formulas based on heating oil are absent from long-
</p>
<p>term gas contracts. Yet divergences over extended periods of time do occur, which
</p>
<p>are due to the following factors:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Gas prices are usually based on the upper heating value Hs rather than on the
</p>
<p>lower heating value Hiwhich is common on other energy markets. A cubic meter
</p>
<p>of natural gas with an upper heating value of 11.5 kWh/m3 contains the same
</p>
<p>10Liquidity can be measured using the so-called churn rate, defined as the ratio of traded volume to
</p>
<p>physically delivered volume.

<p>energy content as 1.05 kg (or 1.15 l, respectively) of heating oil.11 However,
</p>
<p>even when this difference in measurement is accounted for, wholesale gas prices
</p>
<p>still differ from the energy-equivalent prices of heating oil due to a difference in
</p>
<p>the user value of the two fuels.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Gas prices exhibit very strong seasonality, traditionally even more so than
</p>
<p>heating oil prices. In addition, they spike during extremely cold winter and hot
</p>
<p>summer days (see Fig. 9.3). The reason is the comparatively high storage cost of
</p>
<p>gas, which prevents the holding of stocks that buffer surges in demand.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Volumes of storage that are high or low for the season as well as disruptions in
</p>
<p>the gas infrastructure (e.g. due to hurricanes) can also impact the spot price of
</p>
<p>natural gas.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Finally, gas transportation cost may cause gas prices to differ between regional
</p>
<p>markets.
</p>
<p>While the prices of wholesale gas and heating oil are expected to be related,
</p>
<p>these considerations serve to qualify this relationship. Indeed, until 2006 it used to
</p>
<p>be quite close in the United States but has fundamentally changed after 2009 at the
</p>
<p>latest (see Fig. 9.3). While the gas price still followed the 2008 hike in the price of
</p>
<p>heating oil, the two prices have become uncorrelated since 2009. Accordingly, a
</p>
<p>stable price relation is predicted until the end of 2006 or perhaps 2008 only.
</p>
<p>In estimating this relationship, one is confronted with the following methodo-
</p>
<p>logical problem. As is the case with most financial time series, the two fuel price
</p>
<p>series are not stationary, i.e. their means and variances are time-dependent.

<p>Table 9.5 contains first indications suggesting that the (logarithm of) the two prices
</p>
<p>may not be stationary. In particular, the negative skewness points to an asymmetry
</p>
<p>in the distribution that may be due to a shifting mean or variance σ2. Contrary to
</p>
<p>the normal distribution (whose skewness is zero because of symmetry), a
</p>
<p>log-normal distribution has positive skewness which depends on its variance.
</p>
<p>It is given by (eσ2&thorn;2)(eσ2&ndash;1)1/2. With the values in Table 9.5, skewness given
log-normality would amount to (e0.3412&thorn;2)(e0.3412&ndash;1)1/2 &frac14; 1.096 for the gas price
and (e0.6742&thorn;2)(e0.6742&ndash;1)1/2 &frac14; 2.711 for the heating oil price. The observed values
�0.121 and �0.435 are far away from these benchmarks, indicating that the
logarithms of the two prices are not normally distributed, possibly due to a
</p>
<p>stochastic trend, i.e. non-stationarity.
</p>
<p>First differences Δlnpt &frac14; lnpt &ndash; lnpt-1 usually do not contain a trend anymore.
Also, amounting to percentage changes, they have a natural interpretation (see Sect.
</p>
<p>5.1). Statistical tests for non-stationarity such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
</p>
<p>(ADF test) or the Phillips-Perron test (PP test) are described e.g. in Engle and
</p>
<p>Granger (1987). According to the two bottom lines of Table 9.5, the hypothesis of
</p>
<p>non-stationarity can be rejected at a high level of significance for the percentage
</p>
<p>changes in both the U.S. city gate gas price and the New York harbor heating oil
</p>
<p>price. The two modified price series are therefore called integrated of order zero,
</p>
<p>while the original ones, integrated of order one.
</p>
<p>If two time series are integrated of order one or higher, OLS regression is
</p>
<p>inappropriate as it may estimate a relationship where there is nothing but a common
</p>
<p>stochastic trend. While an OLS regression relating the percentage changes may
</p>
<p>solve this problem, its estimated parameters show only the short-term relation
</p>
<p>between the two prices but not a possible long-term relation. If such a long-term
</p>
<p>relation exists, the two time series are called cointegrated. This means that they tend
</p>
<p>to return to their long-term relation after some time; in the short term, however, they
</p>
<p>may develop independently of each other. The formal representation of this long-
</p>
<p>term relationship is the so-called cointegration equation, to be interpreted as the
</p>
<p>equilibrium relation between the two time series.
</p>
<p>The error correction approach developed in the context of nonstationary time
</p>
<p>series analysis (see Engle and Granger 1987) has become the standard method to
</p>
<p>identify a possible cointegration equation. The first step is to find out whether two

<p>time series are cointegrated or not. Here the Johansen test can be used (Johansen
</p>
<p>1991). Applied to the U.S. monthly fuel prices shown in Fig. 9.3, this test confirms
</p>
<p>cointegration for the period up to 2008 but not after, as revealed by Fig. 9.3. Next,
</p>
<p>the Johansen test also suggests the following cointegration equation for the com-
</p>

<p>&eth;9:23&THORN;
</p>
<p>Equation (9.23) can be interpreted as follows. Its first row explains what happens
</p>
<p>if the cointegration equation (9.22) is not satisfied at time t, resulting in a difference
</p>
<p>between the observed (logarithm of the) gas price and its value predicted by the
</p>
<p>regression using the heating oil price. The parameter �0.409 indicates the extent to
which such a difference decreases per unit during period t. Accordingly, it takes on
</p>
<p>average 1/0.409 &frac14; 2.44 months for a disequilibrium to be eliminated. For a
comparison with European long-term gas import contracts with their price formula,
</p>
<p>one may interpret equation (9.21) as pertaining to a cointegration equation,
</p>
<p>neglecting the fact that it is in arithmetic rather than logarithmic values. However,
</p>
<p>any shock in month t would affect the moving average only with one-sixth of its
</p>
<p>value, and the moving average itself is lagged by three months. Therefore the
</p>
<p>estimated coefficient 0.504 shrinks to 0.084, indicating an adjustment period of
</p>
<p>12 (&frac14; 1/0.084) months, to which three months have to be added. This exceeds the
2.44 months estimated above by far, indicating that adjustments to shocks are much
</p>
<p>more sluggish in European than U.S. imports of natural gas.
</p>
<p>The second row of Eq. (9.23) shows the short-term relationship between relative
</p>
<p>changes in the gas price and the heating oil price. It is lagged by one month to
</p>
<p>render it predetermined in period t, thus making it unlikely that causality runs from
</p>
<p>the dependent variable Δln( pGas,t) to the explanatory variable rather than the other
</p>
<p>way round. According to the positive (but insignificant) sign of 0.110, the
</p>
<p>220 9 Markets for Gaseous Fuels</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>coefficient pertaining to Δln(pGas,t�1), gas price fluctuations may be somewhat
self-reinforcing, implying high price volatility. This would motivate gas traders to
</p>
<p>hedge the price risk by signing long-term gas contracts, forwards, and futures.
</p>
<p>The third row of Eq. (9.23) shows the impact of some shocks, represented by
</p>
<p>three exogenous variables.
</p>
<p>&ndash; GASST-RESID: unusually high stocks of gas (in percent of the seasonal mean);
</p>
<p>&ndash; TEMP-RESID: unusual temperatures during the heating season;
</p>
<p>&ndash; DMY: dummy variable reflecting unusual events (hurricanes, spillovers from
</p>
<p>turbulences on financial markets).
</p>
<p>As expected, unusually high stocks have a recognizable dampening effect on
</p>
<p>surges of the gas price. According to Table 9.5, the average value of Δln( pGas,t) is
</p>
<p>0.008 or 0.8% per month. Compared to it, the coefficient of &ndash;0.0025 pertaining to
</p>
<p>GASST-RESID is anything but small, indicating that an extra percentage point in
</p>
<p>excess of the usual magnitude of gas stocks serves to slow the average price
</p>
<p>increase from 0.8 to 0.55 (&frac14; 0.8 &ndash; 0.25) percent per month ceteris paribus.
Somewhat surprisingly, TEMP-RESID is statistically insignificant, while the occur-
</p>
<p>rence of an unusual event swamps everything else by turning the 0.8% increase into
</p>
<p>a 27.3 (&frac14; 28.1 &ndash; 0.8) percent decrease in price.
In sum, the model (9.23) provides an interesting explanation of the
</p>
<p>U.S. wholesale gas market before the shale gas revolution. However, the new
</p>
<p>fracking technology led to a basic change, breaking up the stable relation between
</p>
<p>gas and heating oil prices. Between 2010 and 2014 wholesale gas prices are less
</p>
<p>than half the level predicted under the old regime. In addition, they were not
</p>
<p>affected by the collapse of heating oil prices at the end of 2014, suggesting that
</p>
<p>U.S. gas markets have become fully independent of the heating oil market despite
</p>
<p>the fact that the two fuels continue to be close substitutes. The likely reason is that at
</p>
<p>relatively low prices, gas has conquered new markets (in particular for power
</p>
<p>generation), where the relevant substitutive fuel is not heating oil but coal.
</p>
<p>9.4 Third Party Access to the Gas Infrastructure
</p>
<p>Third party access (TPA) describes a situation in which agents other than the owner
</p>
<p>of an asset are allowed to use the asset. In the case of natural gas, traders other than
</p>
<p>the owners of the gas infrastructure (in particular the grid) can use it for transport.
</p>
<p>Without TPA, the set of trading partners is limited to those companies who have
</p>
<p>their own transport capacities for their service area. Therefore a liquid natural gas
</p>
<p>market is possible only if the operators of the grid offer other parties effective,
</p>
<p>nondiscriminatory, and transparent TPA.
</p>
<p>This access can be granted on a negotiated or a regulatory basis. In the first case,
</p>
<p>traders and grid operators need to sign contracts allowing the use of the grid and
</p>
<p>specifying the terms of its use. If more than a handful grid contracts are to be
</p>
<p>negotiated, they are quite unlikely to be nondiscriminatory in the sense that all
</p>
<p>9.4 Third Party Access to the Gas Infrastructure 221</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>traders benefit from the same access conditions. In the second case, contracts are
</p>
<p>still necessary but their rates and conditions are set by a public regulator, who
</p>
<p>denies the grid operator the right to reject third parties seeking to sign a contract.
</p>
<p>Conditions importantly specify the beginning and end of a gas transfer as well the
</p>
<p>quantity per time unit to be transported.
</p>
<p>Regulated TPA comprises two very different variants.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Contract path (also known as point-to-point system): Gas traders choose the
</p>
<p>entry and the exit points as well as the pipelines between the two points they
</p>
<p>want to use. The grid operator allocates this transport capacity provided it is
</p>
<p>available and charges the transportation fee, which may be a function of distance
</p>
<p>or a flat rate, depending on the type of regulation.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Entry-exit system: Here, entry and exit capacities are booked and charged
</p>
<p>separately. This permits a trader who has booked entry capacities to sell gas
</p>
<p>during the reservation period to any party disposing of exit capacities for the
</p>
<p>same period. Conversely, traders who have booked exit capacities can contract
</p>
<p>with others who have entry capacities during the same period. The grid operator
</p>
<p>charges entry fees and exit fees but no distance-related transportation fees.
</p>
<p>Entry-exit systems amount to virtual hubs or market areas, respectively. There
</p>
<p>must be an agent who controls the relevant part of the pipeline grid, maintains its
</p>
<p>pressure, registers applications for capacity by traders, and coordinates the gas
</p>
<p>flows through the grid. The condition is that these flows can be executed during
</p>
<p>each time interval given the capacities of the pipelines. The agent also identifies gas
</p>
<p>traders who have excess capacity and excess transportation demand relative to
</p>
<p>capacity and provides the necessary positive or negative balancing energy. While
</p>
<p>imbalances can often be offset at the aggregate level in this way, this is not always
</p>
<p>possible, exposing traders to the risk of failure to fulfil their contracts. Of course,
</p>
<p>traders are charged for their imbalances and may even be fined for them if they are
</p>
<p>sizable.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the separate booking of entry and exit capacities enhances
</p>
<p>trading opportunities: Traders who hold exit capacities but no entry capacities can
</p>
<p>purchase gas from traders who have entry capacities for the same time interval.
</p>
<p>Situations where the physical flow between an entry and an exit point turns out to
</p>
<p>exceed the capacity of the pipeline system can be avoided by limiting admissible
</p>
<p>gas flows at all entry and exit points to values that are compatible with capacity.
</p>
<p>This calls for specifying hydraulic load flow models and solving them for short
</p>
<p>(typically hourly) intervals. The objective is for the grid operator to offer firm rather
</p>
<p>than interruptible entry and exit capacities to the greatest extent possible.
</p>
<p>Still, the risk of failure to fulfil contracts may persist. There are two ways to
</p>
<p>further lower it:
</p>
<p>&ndash; The size of the market area may be reduced. This leads to fewer restrictions on
</p>
<p>the allocation of firm entry and exit capacities. On the other hand, smaller market
</p>
<p>areas diminish market liquidity, the number of market participants, and hence
</p>
<p>222 9 Markets for Gaseous Fuels</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>trade benefits. Also, traders may enjoy more market power since they are less
</p>
<p>exposed to the pressure of competition from other market areas due to the
</p>
<p>transportation cost of border-crossing gas.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Firm and interruptible capacities are offered alongside each other. This more
</p>
<p>common alternative enables the grid operator to avoid bottlenecks by blocking
</p>
<p>traders with (lower-priced) interruptible capacities from access at critical entry
</p>
<p>and exit points.
</p>
<p>Bookings of entry and exit capacities may be honored on a first-come-first-
</p>
<p>served basis. This rule not only favors incumbents to the detriment of newcomers
</p>
<p>but also creates scope for traders to manipulate the wholesale gas market. An
</p>
<p>obvious strategy is the purchase of entry capacities designed to prevent competitors
</p>
<p>from delivering gas to the market area, resulting in so-called foreclosure. It is
</p>
<p>attractive if the achievable price markup exceeds the unit cost of these extra
</p>
<p>capacities. The regulator can counteract this strategy by imposing the &lsquo;use it or
</p>
<p>lose it&rsquo; principle: Wholesale traders who hold firm entry or exit bookings but fail to
</p>
<p>order commensurate transportation services (before a defined closing date) lose
</p>
<p>their capacities to other customers. A more market-oriented approach is for the grid
</p>
<p>operator to create a secondary market for entry and exit rights that allows traders to
</p>
<p>buy and sell unused capacity rights. As always, abuse of market power may have to
</p>
<p>be reined in by public authorities.
</p>
<p>Many grid-related aspects of the wholesale gas market are quite similar to those
</p>
<p>of the market for electricity, which are discussed in Chap. 13. However, European
</p>
<p>gas markets continue to be characterized by a few particularities. The gas year starts
</p>
<p>on October 1 at 6.00 a.m. and ends in the following year on October 1 at 5.59
</p>
<p>a.m. Due to the importance of gas in the space heating market, the calendar year is
</p>
<p>not appropriate as it cuts into the heating season. Next, the smallest trading unit is a
</p>
<p>block of 1 MWh, i.e. 1 MW to be delivered during one hour. Day-ahead contracts
</p>
<p>with delivery within 24 h are typical of spot markets, while block contracts for
</p>
<p>months, quarters, and years are traded on futures markets.
</p>
<p>Turning to the final users of natural gas, their demand exhibits a strong seasonal
</p>
<p>pattern because it importantly derives from their demand for space heating. How-
</p>
<p>ever, gas consumers with other uses have a more balanced demand profile. Com-
</p>
<p>monly used indicators are full load hours FLH or full load days FLD, respectively.
</p>
<p>For instance, annual gas sales can be expressed as the product of capacity (called
</p>
<p>maximum load) and degree of utilization (measured in hours per year). Division by
</p>
<p>the maximum load yields FLH (FLD, respectively if utilization is measured in days
</p>
<p>per year),
</p>
<p>FLH &frac14;
Gas sales m3=a&frac12; �
</p>
<p>max:load m3&frac12; � per h
and FLD &frac14;
</p>
<p>Gas sales m3=a&frac12; �
</p>
<p>max:load m3&frac12; � per day
: &eth;9:24&THORN;
</p>
<p>As shown in Table 9.6, average capacity utilization of the gas infrastructure is
</p>
<p>low, amounting to 3600 of 8760 h and 150 of 365 days (or 41%) per year,
</p>
<p>respectively. Moreover, there are substantial differences between consumer groups.
</p>
<p>9.4 Third Party Access to the Gas Infrastructure 223</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_13">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_13</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>While most of the demand by private households occurs during relatively few hours
</p>
<p>and days, resulting in a capacity utilization of no more than 26%, demand by
</p>
<p>industrial consumers is more regular, resulting in a capacity utilization of up to
</p>
<p>58%.
</p>
<p>In view of this high degree of volatility, predicting demand is important. One of
</p>
<p>the common explanatory variables is the heating degree day HDDt :&frac14; max(0, 15&ndash;
Tempt), where Tempt is the average outside temperature of day tmeasured in degree
</p>
<p>Celsius (�C). It is positive on days with an average outside temperature below 15 �C
</p>
<p>and zero otherwise. Daily fluctuations in the demand for gas can be well explained
</p>
<p>by models using this variable. Yet even with reasonably accurate predictions, costly
</p>
<p>gas storage facilities are needed to optimize capacity utilization of the pipeline
</p>
<p>infrastructure.
</p>
<p>An alternative is to provide financial incentives for using the gas infrastructure in
</p>
<p>a more regular way. For instance, costumers with a so-called structured gas contract
</p>
<p>reach a capacity utilization of up to 46% (see Table 9.6 again). These customers can
</p>
<p>be gas distributors or large-scale industrial users who agree to shift part of their
</p>
<p>demand out of peak periods if necessary. For a maximum relief effect, they should
</p>
<p>be located near a gas well, permitting them to obtain their regular supply without
</p>
<p>greatly burdening the transport infrastructure.

<p>Markets for Solid Fuels and CO2 Emissions 10
</p>
<p>Solid fuels are hard coal, lignite, and firewood. Their common properties are low
</p>
<p>energy densities resulting in high cost of transportation which in turn limits
</p>
<p>competition in solid fuel markets. Thanks to reduced costs of coal extraction,
</p>
<p>productivity increases in maritime transport, and reduced public subsidies, a global
</p>
<p>market for hard coal has nevertheless developed.
</p>
<p>Due to coal&rsquo;s high carbon content, coal combustion is the major source of global
</p>
<p>CO2 emissions, amounting to about three tons of CO2 per ton of hard coal. In
</p>
<p>addition, coal mining is associated with emission of methane (so-called pit gas),
</p>
<p>another important greenhouse gas. Thus the economics of coal markets cannot be
</p>
<p>discussed without referring to international efforts designed to reduce global
</p>
<p>emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. In an attempt to achieve this aim,
</p>
<p>the European Union created a market for CO2emission allowances (EU Directive
</p>
<p>2003/87/EC). Depending on the effectiveness of this system, CO2 emissions may
</p>
<p>become sufficiently costly to increase the price of coal relative to that of other fuels,
</p>
<p>triggering its substitution by less harmful alternatives.
</p>
<p>The issues addressed in this chapter are:
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the factors determining the development of the market for hard coal?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What determines its price on the world market?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Is the market for coal competitive?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Is there a trend towards vertical integration as in the oil industry?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the perspectives of solid biofuels and in particular wood as a substitute
</p>
<p>for coal?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What determines the price of emission rights?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How do these prices depend on the design of the market for emissions?

<p>10.1 Solid Fuels and Their Technologies
</p>
<p>Solid fuels comprise types of coal, lignite, wood, and biomass fuels which differ
</p>
<p>widely in terms of their properties. Coal with a carbon content below 55% of dry
</p>
<p>matter belongs to the category of lignite, whereas fuels with a carbon content
</p>
<p>between 55% and 65% are categorized as hard coal. Table 10.1 presents some
</p>
<p>properties of economically relevant solid fuels. Their water content ranges between
</p>
<p>6% in hard coal and up to 65% in soft lignite. On the whole, it varies inversely with
</p>
<p>the energy content measured using the lower heating value. Accordingly, anthracite
</p>
<p>has the highest heating value of up to 37.7 MJ/kg but still falls short of liquid and
</p>
<p>gaseous fuels (see Tables 8.7 and 9.2). The heating values of lignite, firewood, and
</p>
<p>other biomass fuels are lower, causing them to have comparatively high transporta-
</p>
<p>tion cost per energy unit.
</p>
<p>In return, biomass fuels have the advantage that their combustion is not
</p>
<p>associated with a net emission of greenhouse gases. The CO2 emissions released
</p>
<p>from burning firewood are compensated by the growth of trees and other biofuels.
</p>
<p>Assuming a constant global stock of biomass, these fuels are therefore neutral with
</p>
<p>respect to CO2 emissions (see Table 10.1 again). Conversely, the combustion of all
</p>
<p>types of hard coal is associated with very high CO2 emissions, whether in terms of g
</p>
<p>CO2/MJ or kg CO2 per kg of matter. Properties not listed in Table 10.1 are ash
</p>
<p>content (varying from 4% to 10%) and sulfur content (0.3% to 1.1%). They may be
</p>
<p>of considerable relevance to the users of the fuel.
</p>
<p>10.1.1 Biomass
</p>
<p>Until the first half of the nineteenth century, firewood was the dominant fuel; yet
</p>
<p>with industrialization its supply could not keep up with demand. In its modern
</p>
<p>forms, biomass contributes but little to covering energy demand, for reasons that
</p>
<p>become evident from Fig. 10.1 which presents a classification of biomass fuels.
</p>
<p>Their potential depends on two parameters, the availability of land and its produc-
</p>
<p>tivity. For instance, one ha of forest yields between 0.5 and 1.5 tons of dry matter
</p>
<p>per year but up to 15 tons if stocked with fast-growing trees (see short-rotation
</p>
<p>wood in Table 10.2). While residual timber from industry is economically quite
</p>
<p>attractive, its potential is largely exhausted since it cannot be burned untreated in
</p>
<p>countries with a restrictive greenhouse gas policy. Treated residual timber is more
</p>
<p>costly yet originally was charged with a disposal fee in some countries, causing it to

<p>rare instances where a commodity changes from a negatively to a positively valued

<p>good.
</p>
<p>An agricultural residue is straw, which however only yields up to six tons of dry
</p>

</p>
<p>of 17 MJ/kg, comparable to the other biomass fuels.

<p>These processes are characterized by substantial energy losses, partly because only
</p>
<p>the starch and oil components of the biomass are suitable for energetic use. Up to
</p>
<p>present, cellulose, lignin, and tannin can only be used when burning wood, whereas
</p>
<p>an efficient thermal use requires the biomass to be shred and dried. This serves to
</p>
<p>increase its density up to 600 kg/m3 (as in the case of wood pellets) and hence to
</p>
<p>lower its cost of transportation; however, these processes are themselves costly.
</p>
<p>In sum, collection, transportation, and processing constitute the major cost
</p>
<p>components of solid biomass, which vary considerably depending on desired
</p>
<p>form of delivery (e.g. as piece goods or bulk goods) as well as topography. In
</p>
<p>addition, local and regional market conditions determine prices. Though firewood is
</p>
<p>typically cheaper than other fossil energy sources, it often loses this advantage due
</p>
<p>to higher outlays for burners, maintenance, and waste disposal.
</p>
<p>10.1.2 Coal Reserves
</p>
<p>The invention of the steam engine by James Watt in 1765 caused coal to dominate
</p>
<p>fossil energy markets for two reasons. On the one hand, it enabled the exploitation
</p>
<p>of underground coal mines because water could be pumped out in great quantities;
</p>
<p>on the other hand, growing coal extraction was necessary to run the steam engines.
</p>
<p>This mutual reinforcement of supply and demand is a typical feature of successful
</p>
<p>basic innovations to this day.
</p>
<p>Although a non-renewable resource, coal has reserves that are still far from
</p>
<p>being exhausted. Their static range substantially exceeds 100 years (see
</p>
<p>Table 10.3). In view of this abundance, it is not surprising that a scarcity rent of
</p>
<p>coal is virtually nonexistent, in contradistinction with crude oil and natural gas (see
</p>
<p>the Hotelling model in Sect. 6.2.1). In addition, coal reserves are rather evenly
</p>
<p>distributed over the globe, with a large part located in industrial countries such as
</p>
<p>Australia, the United States, Canada, and China. For this reason, coal is called &lsquo;the
</p>
<p>energy source of the north&rsquo;.

<p>During the early coal era, mass transport of coal over long distances was quite
</p>
<p>expensive or even impossible, in spite of railways and inland waterways. Up to the
</p>
<p>nineteenth century it was cheaper to bring people to the coal than coal to the people.
</p>
<p>As a result, industrial clusters developed around coal fields, in particular iron, steel,
</p>
<p>manufacturing, and mechanical engineering industries. European examples are
</p>
<p>Central England, Northern France, the Meuse and Ruhr areas, and Upper Silesia.
</p>
<p>Today these regions are suffering from severe economic and social problems
</p>
<p>because electricity has replaced coal as the dominant energy source in production.
</p>
<p>Electricity can be transported to remote areas at low cost, thus lowering energy-
</p>
<p>related returns to agglomeration. Currently coal is used exclusively in electricity
</p>
<p>generation (as so-called steam coal) and steel production (as coke).
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, global coal mining has kept expanding for many years for a number
</p>
<p>of reasons:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Economic growth of emerging countries, in particular China and India, has been
</p>
<p>pushing demand for electricity and with it, coal;
</p>
<p>&ndash; After several hikes in the prices of crude oil (see Sect. 8.3) and natural gas (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 9.3), coal has become a relatively inexpensive energy source;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Many coal-producing countries have been reluctant to adopt greenhouse gas
</p>
<p>reduction strategies.
</p>
<p>10.1.3 Surface and Underground Coal Mining
</p>
<p>Two coal mining technologies can be distinguished, surface mining and under-
</p>
<p>ground mining (often simply called mining). The choice of mining technology is
</p>
<p>largely determined by the geology of the coal deposit. Surface mining (also known
</p>
<p>as opencast mining) requires the resettlement of households and companies who
</p>
<p>occupy a licensed mining area of many square kilometers&mdash;a socially sensitive,

<p>often conflict-laden, and time-consuming process. After closure of the mine,
</p>
<p>governments usually demand rehabilitation of the land, which is particularly costly
</p>
<p>in the case of surface mining. Yet surface mining can still be cheaper than
</p>
<p>underground mining if the coal beds are close to the surface, enabling the use of
</p>
<p>large-scale equipment and facilitating material flows comprising not only coal but
</p>
<p>also soil, rocks, and overburden removal.
</p>
<p>Coal beds several hundred meters below the surface are exploited by under-
</p>
<p>ground mining through shafts and tunnels. Modern technology uses long wall
</p>
<p>mining, which involves the drilling of a section of 100&ndash;350 m length along the
</p>
<p>coal seam in one step using mechanical shearers. Self-advancing, hydraulically-
</p>
<p>powered supports temporarily hold the roof until the coal is extracted, after which
</p>
<p>the roof is allowed to collapse. While both surface and underground mining call for
</p>
<p>elaborate water management, the underground alternative additionally requires
</p>
<p>effort to prevent pit gas explosions that jeopardize miners&rsquo; lives.1 Another chal-
</p>
<p>lenge confronting underground mining is surface subsidence affecting buildings,
</p>
<p>infrastructure, ground water, and local land use in its neighborhood.
</p>
<p>The choice of technology has cost implications. Notably, labor productivity of
</p>
<p>surface mining ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 tons per worker and year, compared to
</p>
<p>5000&ndash;8000 tons in underground mining&mdash;despite substantial increases in produc-
</p>
<p>tivity. Since old mines have low marginal cost (see Sect. 1.2.1), surface mining
</p>
<p>tends to be more competitive than underground mining. This holds true in particular
</p>
<p>where infrastructure for transporting large volumes of coal to both domestic and
</p>
<p>international customers is in existence, creating scale economies.
</p>
<p>10.1.4 International Coal Market
</p>
<p>Steam coal accounts for about 70% of international trade in coal. It continues to be
</p>
<p>dominated by bilateral contracts (of the so-called over-the-counter or OTC type,
</p>
<p>respectively) between producers and wholesale customers. These contracts often
</p>
<p>have a duration of 10 years, with prices that are adjusted to the coal spot price
</p>
<p>annually in the fourth quarter. Since these prices need not be published, the world
</p>
<p>market for coal has been lacking transparency.
</p>
<p>With the liberalization of electricity markets (see Sect. 12.2.2), the need for
</p>
<p>transparency has increased because generating companies seek to hedge their coal
</p>
<p>position on financial markets using regular price information. One such source are
</p>
<p>standardized surveys of traders, e.g. the weekly publication of the British
</p>
<p>McCloskey Coal Information Services (since 1991). Its quotations are in USD per
</p>
<p>metric ton of coal with a heating value of 6000 kcal/kg and a sulfur content of 1%.
</p>
<p>Another source is the British service provider Tradition Financial Services (TFS)
</p>
<p>who publishes a set of price indices, API#1 for the American market, API#2 for the
</p>

</p>
<p>and emerging countries regularly report major accidents in pits.

<p>the European Energy Exchange (EEX) also provide price data (see Fig. 10.2).
</p>
<p>According to Fig. 10.2, coal prices spiked in 2008 and again in 2011, similar to
</p>
<p>those of natural gas and other fossil fuels. Starting in 2012, however, coal has
</p>
<p>become cheap compared to natural gas. Without attempting to explain these
</p>
<p>developments in detail, the following determinants can be cited.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Decreasing coal exports from the United States: This country was home to major
</p>
<p>coal exporters until the end of the 1990s, who acted as swing producers. This
</p>
<p>stabilizing force has been absent since then.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Development of Chinese coal exports: Caused by rapid economic growth,
</p>
<p>domestic demand for electricity and hence coal surged until 2012, reducing its
</p>
<p>availability for exports. This forced importing countries like Japan and Korea to
</p>
<p>obtain their supplies from more remote areas, causing freight rates to be bid up
</p>
<p>worldwide. Meanwhile, Chinese growth has slowed, making coal available
</p>
<p>again on the international market, with concomitant downward pressure on its
</p>
<p>price.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The coal price in Europe also depends on the exchange rates of the Australian
</p>
<p>Dollar and the South African Rand. Australia and South Africa are home to
</p>
<p>major coal exporters, who quote their deliveries in their respective currencies.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Finally, short-term price spikes may be caused by political and social unrest,
</p>
<p>military conflict, and outages of nuclear power.

<p>10.2 The Greenhouse Gas Problem
</p>
<p>More than 43% of energy-related CO2 emissions originate from coal combustion, a
</p>
<p>share which is growing. In view of international attempts at mitigating the green-
</p>
<p>house gas problem in general and reducing CO2 emissions in particular (see bottom
</p>
<p>lines of Table 10.4), the markets for coal cannot be discussed without addressing
</p>
<p>these issues.
</p>
<p>The greenhouse gas (GHG) problem is the consequence of anthropogenic
</p>
<p>emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases such as methane
</p>
<p>(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O, see Table 10.4) along with vapor into the atmo-
</p>
<p>sphere. According to climatologists, CO2 allows short-wave solar light to pass the
</p>
<p>atmosphere while blocking the reflection of long-wave thermal radiation. Without
</p>
<p>this greenhouse effect, the mean temperature of the globe would be �18 �C rather
than +16 �C at present. Since the beginning of industrialization around 1840, the
</p>
<p>CO2 concentration in the atmosphere increased from 280 ppmv (parts per million
</p>
<p>by volume) to 390 ppmv as of 2011, according to the International Panel on Climate
</p>
<p>Change (IPCC). Over the same period, mean global temperature increased by
</p>
<p>0.5 �C (possibly even by 0.8 �C, depending on method of measurement), suggesting
</p>
<p>that global warming is caused by the increase in CO2 concentration.
</p>
<p>Annual CO2 emissions keep increasing globally (see Fig. 10.3). While they have
</p>
<p>been slowly falling in Europe and remaining stable in North America since about
</p>
<p>2007, they have been growing rapidly in the rest of the world, most notably in China
</p>
<p>in the wake of its economic growth. This has to do with the fact that the most
</p>
<p>important anthropogenic source of CO2 emissions is the burning of fossil fuels.
2
</p>
<p>The GHG effect of other emissions is expressed in CO2 equivalents. According to
</p>
<p>Table 10.4, the CO2 equivalent of methane (CH4) is 25 and of nitrous oxide (N2O),
</p>
<p>298 if a time horizon of 100 years is adopted. It is important to note that CO2 is no
</p>
<p>poison in the classic sense&mdash;it is even necessary for the growth of plants. Yet at the
</p>
<p>current annual rate of more than 35 bn tons of global CO2 emissions (40 bn tons of
</p>
<p>CO2 equivalents from all GHG emissions, respectively), the GHG concentration in
</p>
<p>the atmosphere will continue to increase. This is likely to lead to a considerable
</p>
<p>increase in average global temperatures, which is believed to have many negative
</p>
<p>long-term impacts. Among those cited are acidification of oceans, increased fre-
</p>
<p>quency of thunderstorms, changing distribution of precipitation, desertification,
</p>
<p>melting of glaciers, thawing of permafrost, a rising sea level, and changing habitats
</p>
<p>for plants and animals. However, some of the world&rsquo;s regions may also benefit from
</p>
<p>increased plant growth and reduced heating requirements due to warmer
</p>
<p>temperatures. Since most of these regions are in the rich North while those
</p>
<p>2Global methane emissions are much smaller than CO2 emissions, and their rate of decay in the
</p>
<p>atmosphere is higher as well. But one mole of methane has an impact on the climate that is
</p>
<p>56 times (over a time horizon of 20 years) or 21 times (100 years) greater than that of one mole of
</p>
<p>CO2.

<p>negatively affected are in the poor South, the GHG problem raises major equity
</p>
<p>concerns (Bretschger 2015, Chap. 4).
</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of welfare economics, the reduction target should satisfy the
</p>
<p>following condition for Pareto optimality (see Sect. 7.2): The present value of
</p>
<p>expected damages avoided thanks to the last reduction project is to equal the present

</p>
<p>meeting a reduction target are known with certainty. In particular, knowledge
</p>
<p>regarding future damage associated with present GHG emissions is not sufficient
</p>
<p>to implement the Pareto criterion. For example, Nordhaus and Boyer (2000)
</p>
<p>estimate the optimal CO2 price (in the sense of a Pigouvian tax; see Sect. 7.3.1)
</p>
<p>to be around 10 USD per ton of CO2. Therefore, this amount of tax would establish

<p>expected marginal cost caused by reducing CO2 emissions. By way of contrast,
</p>
<p>B&euro;ohringer and Rutherford (2000) conclude that even a rather modest reduction of
</p>
<p>GHG emissions would imply a cost of much more than 100 USD per ton of CO2
equivalent. In view of divergences of this magnitude, there is no sound alternative
</p>
<p>for GHG reduction policy than to adopt the so-called standard-price approach (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 7.3.2).
</p>
<p>The standard-price approach calls for a political decision with regard to a target
</p>
<p>value of emissions and putting a tax price on them that promises to reach this target.
</p>
<p>For example, let the long-term tolerable CO2 concentration in the atmosphere be
</p>
<p>between 450 and 550 ppmv. The realized value is the result of annual CO2
emissions and natural decay (Nordhaus 1994),
</p>
<p>Mt &frac14; Mt�1 �
1
</p>
<p>τ
Mt�1 �Mpre
� �
</p>
<p>&thorn; β � Emt: &eth;10:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here, Mt symbolizes the realized CO2 inventory at time t, which is given by the
</p>
<p>previous inventory Mt�1 minus the decay of inventory added to its pre-industrial
</p>
<p>level Mpre plus the share β of current emissions Emt that adds to the stock of CO2.
</p>
<p>The parameter τ reflects the average duration of CO2 in the atmosphere (τ &frac14; 120
years according to the International Panel on Climate Change IPCC); therefore
</p>
<p>1/τ &frac14; 0.0083 is the estimated rate of decay per year. As to β, Nordhaus (1994)
estimates an OLS regression to obtain β &frac14; 0.64. Therefore, 64% of CO2 emissions
end up in the atmosphere rather than being sequestered by oceans and notably
</p>
<p>trees.3
</p>
<p>Once the tolerable concentration of CO2 equivalents is fixed, GHG emission
</p>
<p>trajectories can be calculated using Eq. (10.1). These trajectories have the property
</p>
<p>that annual reductions need to be larger the later they begin (see Fig. 10.4).
</p>
<p>According to Stern (2006, p. 201), GHG emissions would have to reach their
</p>
<p>maximum before 2025 and then decline at rates between �3 and �4% per year if
the tolerable GHG concentration is set at 550 ppmv CO2 equivalents. Along this
</p>
<p>path, the GHG stock should not exceed 400 ppmv by 2015. In view of the
</p>
<p>390 ppmv concentration of CO2 in that year cited above, there is not much time
</p>
<p>left to act.
</p>
<p>The trajectories shown in Fig. 10.4 derive from welfare economics very much
</p>
<p>like the models of optimal resource depletion discussed in Sect. 6.3. While the
</p>
<p>constraint here is not the stock of resources but the maximum tolerable GHG
</p>
<p>inventory, social time preference plays a role again. It governs the speed with
</p>
<p>which fuels causing GHG emissions need to be substituted by capital. Moreover,
</p>
<p>the pace and direction of expected factor-augmenting technological change is
</p>
<p>important (see Sect. 5.4).
</p>
<p>3More sophisticated models also take the complex physical and chemical exchange between
</p>
<p>atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces into account.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Once the amount of tolerable emissions per year is determined, its distribution
</p>
<p>among claimants needs to be agreed upon, resulting in emission rights (also called
</p>
<p>emission allowances or permits). Several very different approaches exist:
</p>
<p>&ndash; The grandfathering approach allocates permits according to emissions in a base
</p>
<p>period (e.g. the year 1990). It favors countries and industries with high emissions
</p>
<p>in the base year to the detriment of those with low emissions.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The benchmark approach allocates allowances to industries such as power
</p>
<p>generation, production of steel and other base materials, transportation, and
</p>
<p>housing. Since the level of activity (measured e.g. by turnover) needs to be
</p>
<p>accounted for, rich countries stand to receive more emission allowances than
</p>
<p>poor countries.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The egalitarian approach sets a uniform per-capita level of emissions. It there-
</p>
<p>fore allocates permits predominantly to countries with large populations, typi-
</p>
<p>cally poor ones.
</p>
<p>10.3 Markets for Emission Rights
</p>
<p>Any initial distribution of emission rights may be modified if rights are tradable. In
</p>
<p>keeping with the Coase theorem, this results in Pareto improvement (see Sect. 7.1).
</p>
<p>Emission trade would not only generate income for poorer countries through the
</p>
<p>sale of excess emission rights but also contribute to the overall efficiency of GHG
</p>
<p>abatement strategies. Figure 10.5 illustrates the argument. Let two companies cause
</p>
<p>certain amounts of emissions prior to the allocation of emission allowances. These
</p>
<p>amounts are determined by a marginal cost of abatement effort equal to zero,
</p>
<p>implying that neither company makes any effort. As soon as they begin to make

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>effort designed to reduce emissions, they incur some cost of abatement. Let the
</p>
<p>marginal cost of these efforts increase when emissions are to be reduced. This
</p>
<p>assumption can be justified by noting that avoiding the first ton of e.g. CO2
emissions usually does not cost much whereas avoiding another ton after a reduc-
</p>
<p>tion by 100 tons becomes quite costly. Note that their marginal cost schedules
</p>
<p>usually differ. Let company 2 face more quickly increasing marginal cost than does
</p>
<p>company 1; for instance, it may have to pay higher wages to specialists who operate
</p>
<p>its abatement technology.
</p>
<p>Now let the two companies obtain emission rights Em1 and Em2, respectively
</p>
<p>which are insufficient to cover emissions. Both companies therefore must reduce
</p>
<p>emissions, starting of course with the least costly measures (in terms of cost per ton
</p>
<p>of CO2 avoided). In this way, they move up their respective marginal cost schedule
</p>
<p>until the remaining amount of emissions equals their respective permits Em1 and
</p>
<p>Em2. In the example shown in Fig. 10.5, this means that company 2 incurs much
</p>
<p>higher marginal cost for reaching its target than company 1. Its total abatement cost,
</p>
<p>given by the area below the marginal cost curve, is also higher.
</p>
<p>For company 2, it would make economic sense to buy extra emission rights
</p>
<p>which would prevent it from moving up its marginal cost curve this far. It would be
</p>
<p>prepared to pay the marginal cost avoided for each permit. Company 1 in turn still
</p>
<p>benefits from its low marginal cost of abatement at Em1. It would therefore have an
</p>
<p>incentive to reduce its emissions even further, enabling it to sell emission rights. It
</p>
<p>has an incentive to do so as long as the price for a permit paid by company 2 exceeds
</p>
<p>its marginal cost of abatement. Therefore, the difference in marginal cost at the
</p>
<p>respective values Em1 and Em2 creates scope for arbitrage trading which is profit-
</p>
<p>able for both companies.
</p>
<p>This arbitrage (characterizing a so-called cap-and-trade program) implies that
</p>
<p>company 1 reduces emissions beyond its allocation of rights Em1, in return receiv-
</p>
<p>ing revenue from selling them to company 2. On the other hand, company
</p>
<p>2 purchases emission rights as long they are cheaper than its marginal abatement

<p>cost. In the optimum, arbitrage is eliminated through trade, resulting in equality of
</p>
<p>marginal abatement cost for both companies.4
</p>
<p>In a dynamic perspective, the cap-and-trade program may motivate companies to
</p>
<p>intensify their emission abatement efforts. If successful, these efforts cause a
</p>
<p>downward shift of the marginal cost curves shown in Fig. 10.5. This has two
</p>
<p>consequences, which may occur in combination. The given amount of emission
</p>
<p>rights (and hence the emission target) can be attained at a lower cost; or at a given
</p>
<p>cost, the amount of emission rights can be reduced, reflecting a more ambitious
</p>
<p>target in terms of GHG concentration in the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>Note that the introduction of a cap-and-trade program is not possible without the
</p>
<p>intervention of governments, who must determine the legal entities obliged to take
</p>
<p>part in it. In addition they need to verify emission reports and impose sanctions on
</p>
<p>those failing to comply. In the case of the emission trade system created by the
</p>
<p>European Union (EU-ETS; EU Commission 2003), a trading period extends over
</p>
<p>several years, presently from 2013 to 2020 and later on, from 2021 to 2030. Within
</p>
<p>a trading period, a shortfall of emission rights can be compensated by emission
</p>
<p>rights pertaining to the following year, whereas an excess of rights can be used not
</p>
<p>only during the following year but also during the entire next trading period. This
</p>
<p>raises the issue of the optimal length of a trading period: If the period is too long,
</p>
<p>the immediate incentive for reducing CO2 emissions may be weak; if it is too
</p>
<p>short, the system does not incentivize investments that need time to be realized.
</p>
<p>Finally, governments must decide how the emission rights are to be distributed (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 10.2).
</p>
<p>10.3.1 Prices for CO2 Emission Rights
</p>
<p>The European CO2 emission trading system (EU-ETS) started in 2005. In its first
</p>
<p>year, it generated a volume of trade in excess of 320 mn tons of CO2 emission rights
</p>
<p>along with financial transactions worth 8.2 bn EUR (Capoor and Ambrosi 2006,
</p>
<p>p. 13). Traders were not only operators of coal-fired power stations and steel works
</p>
<p>but also investment bankers.
</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 10.6, CO2 prices shot up to almost 30 EUR/tons in 2005 but
</p>
<p>plunged to just about zero by 2007 (see below for an explanation). The jump back to
</p>
<p>prices above 25 EUR/tons in 2008 can be attributed to an increase in the fine for
</p>
<p>missing the target (or for failure to purchase a sufficient amount of emission rights,
</p>
<p>respectively) from 40 to 100 EUR/tons pursuant the European Directive 2003/87/
</p>
<p>EC (EU Commission 2003). In 2011 prices dropped again, likely because aviation
</p>
<p>4Speculative trade may dominate markets for emission rights, depending on the expectations of
</p>
<p>market participants. If an increase in the price of certificates is expected, speculators go long
</p>
<p>(i.e. purchase rights in excess of marginal abatement cost) and vice versa. If their expectations turn
</p>
<p>out to be right, speculators make a profit, otherwise they suffer a loss.
</p>
<p>10.3 Markets for Emission Rights 239</p>

<p>was to be brought into EU-ETS in 2012, with 85% of the rights given away free of
</p>
<p>charge, however.
</p>
<p>Since then, CO2 prices have been consistently below 10 EUR/tons. According to
</p>
<p>the argument expounded above, this level should correspond to the marginal
</p>
<p>abatement cost of the last project that is required to meet the current European
</p>
<p>CO2 emission target (derived from the GHG reduction target of 20% between 1990
</p>
<p>and 2020). Such projects could be investments in energy-efficient production
</p>
<p>facilities but also in power plants that use natural gas or renewables instead of
</p>
<p>coal. At 10 EUR/tons CO2, the wholesale price of hard coal would increase by 41%,
</p>
<p>from 0.8 to 1.13 EUR ct/kWh (see Table 10.5). By way of contrast, natural gas
</p>
<p>would become only 9% more expensive, from a higher base value of 2.2 EUR ct/
</p>
<p>kWh, however. At the resulting price of 2.4 EUR ct/kWh, natural gas is still too
</p>
<p>expensive to induce fuel switching.
</p>
<p>This situation is likely to persist because on European markets, the price of coal
</p>
<p>has been low compared to that of natural gas for several years and may remain so
</p>
<p>even in the face of a more ambitious GHG policy (see Fig. 10.2). In addition, CO2
prices during the first 10 years of EU-ETS have been rather volatile, causing risk-
</p>
<p>averse investors to shy away from projects designed to lower marginal abatement
</p>
<p>costs. Nevertheless, the European Union expects to achieve its GHG targets for
</p>
<p>2020 (in spite of a substantial increase in German CO2 emissions due to the
</p>
<p>country&rsquo;s &lsquo;Energiewende&rsquo;) even in the absence of major growth in pertinent

<p>investment (EEA 2015). In fact, there are several options for reducing CO2
emissions without investing in abatement technology. One is to move (parts of)
</p>
<p>the production from the European Union to regions without a CO2 cap-and-trade
</p>
<p>system; another, to scale back electricity generation by coal-fired plants and to
</p>

<p>If participants in the market for CO2 permits expect these alternatives to abate-
</p>
<p>ment to ensure that the EU-ETS is long at the end of the trading period, they abstain
</p>
<p>from purchasing emission rights while their price is high. This thought suggests that
</p>
<p>the CO2 price is not anchored in the marginal cost of CO2 abatement but rather
</p>
<p>depends on the market situation expected at the end of the trading period. A short
</p>
<p>market means that some companies cannot come up with enough emission rights
</p>
<p>and must pay the penalty of 100 EUR/tons (European Directive 2003/87/EC, EU
</p>
<p>Commission 2003). Therefore, they are willing to pay as much as the sum of the
</p>
<p>forward price plus this penalty for emission rights because they are obliged to make
</p>
<p>up for the shortfall of permits during the following trading period. Conversely, there
</p>
<p>is no reason to pay more than the forward price if the market is long since excess
</p>
<p>permits can be used later.
</p>
<p>This argument provides an explanation of the price drop in April 2006 (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.6): Until that date, most market participants had assumed the market to be
</p>
<p>short at the end of the first trading period 2005&ndash;2007. Yet in April 2006, the
</p>
<p>European Commission reported that in 2005 available emission rights had exceeded
</p>
<p>emissions by about 60,000 tons. As these rights could be used until the end of 2007,
</p>
<p>there was no doubt that the market would be long at the end of the first trading
</p>
<p>period, causing CO2 prices to be low until its end. Developments during the second
</p>
<p>trading period 2008&ndash;2012 can be explained in a similar way. Before September
</p>
<p>2008 most market participants had expected a short market by the end of 2012 but
</p>
<p>revised their in view of the financial crisis and the ensuing recession in Europe.
</p>
<p>They (correctly) predicted a drop in the demand for electricity and hence in the
</p>
<p>demand for coal. Since the market would almost certainly be long at the end of the
</p>
<p>trading period, there was no reason to hoard emission rights; accordingly, the CO2
price plunged from almost 30 EUR/tons to a minimum of 5 EUR/tons.
</p>
<p>Many observers argue that the EU-ETS has failed because it cannot ensure CO2
prices that are high enough to force coal-fueled power generation out of market.
</p>
<p>However, the EU-ETS was not invented to guarantee a certain CO2 price but to
</p>
<p>reach ambitious emission reduction targets at the lowest possible economic cost.
</p>
<p>Since these targets have been met so far, the system has been rather successful&mdash;
</p>
<p>even more successful than originally thought. This is reflected in low CO2 prices.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As long as the basic cap-and-trade principle of the EU-ETS is not abandoned,
</p>
<p>politicians can bring about a substantial increase in CO2 prices by making market
</p>
<p>participants believe that the ETS market will be short at the end of the next trading
</p>
<p>period, e.g. by introducing more ambitious emission reduction targets. However, if
</p>
<p>market participants believe the market to be short at the end of the trading period,
</p>
<p>CO2 prices will be close to the penalty of 100 EUR/tons or even exceed it, resulting
</p>
<p>in disadvantages for the international competitiveness of European industry.
</p>
<p>10.3.2 Clean Dark Spread
</p>
<p>In quite general terms, an excess of the sales price over marginal cost indicates an
</p>
<p>incentive to increase to increase production (see Sect. 1.2.2). It also approximates
</p>
<p>the profit margin since marginal cost usually is not much above average cost. In the
</p>
<p>case of coal-fired electricity generation, the difference between the sales price and
</p>
<p>the marginal cost of the fuel was originally called dark spread DS. In Eq. (10.2)
</p>
<p>below, pel denotes the sales price of electricity (in EUR/MWh; see Sect. 12.2.3),
</p>
<p>while the purchase price of coal pcoal (given in EUR/MWh fuel) is divided by the
</p>
<p>fuel efficiency ω of the coal-fired power plant,
</p>
<p>DS &frac14; pel �
pcoal
ω
</p>
<p>: &eth;10:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>Therefore, the higher the fuel efficiency of coal-fired generation, the cheaper is
</p>
<p>coal as a fuel. However, it is not a clean fuel; accordingly, the so-called clean dark
</p>
<p>spread CDS is calculated by adding α�pCO2, the cost of CO2 emission rights required
for generating electricity to the efficiency-adjusted price of coal,
</p>
<p>CDS &frac14; pelek �
pcoal
ω
</p>
<p>&thorn; α � pCO2
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>: &eth;10:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>The factor α represents the amount of CO2 emissions (in tons) associated with
</p>
<p>the generation of one MWh of electricity. Among other things, it also depends on
</p>
<p>the fuel efficiency ω of the power plant. The (clean) dark spread is defined for
</p>
<p>power stations running on natural gas in an analogous way.
</p>
<p>Since the marginal cost of electricity generation comprises more than the
</p>
<p>(efficiency-adjusted) price of the fuel and the cost of CO2 permits, CDS &gt; 0 is a
</p>
<p>necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a power station fueled by coal or natural
</p>
<p>gas to be viable in the long term (see Sects. 1.2.1 and 12.2.2). For German power
</p>
<p>stations fueled by hard coal, this condition was mostly met during the period from
</p>
<p>2000 to 2014 (see Fig. 10.7). Indeed, the wholesale price of electricity moves
</p>
<p>largely in parallel with that of coal and the cost of CO2 emission permits, the two
</p>
<p>major components of marginal cost. In view of the low own-price elasticity of the
</p>
<p>demand for electricity, an increase in marginal cost results in an almost commen-
</p>
<p>surate increase in the market price (see Sect. 1.2.1). Thus, a higher CO2 price drives
</p>
<p>up the wholesale price of electricity. This is even true of the period from 2005 to

<p>2007, when the German government gave emission rights to electricity generators
</p>
<p>for free (CO2 prices represented an opportunity cost for plant operators). As argued
</p>
<p>in Sect. 10.3.1, generators expected the market for emission rights to be short by the
</p>
<p>end of the first ETS trading period, causing their price to be positive up to 2007,
</p>
<p>when it became clear that the market would be long.
</p>
<p>These observations suggest that the price of electricity and the marginal cost of
</p>
<p>coal as given by Eq. (10.3) may be driven by a common stochastic trend. In fact, the
</p>
<p>169 monthly day-ahead electricity prices pel and the marginal cost of German coal-
</p>
<p>fired power stations (with an assumed fuel efficiency of 38%) turn out to be
</p>
<p>stationary after differentiation with respect to time (see Sect. 9.3.2). Therefore,
</p>
<p>the two time series are integrated of order one, and the appropriate statistical tests
</p>
<p>do not reject the following cointegration equations,
</p>
<p>Baseload electricity price pel base &frac14; 1:31 �

</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>&eth;10:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>According to the first equation, the CDS for German baseload power traded on
</p>
<p>the spot market was 31% of marginal generation cost (see Sect. 12.2.3). Since
</p>
<p>baseload capacities are also needed to meet peak load demand, whose own-price
</p>
<p>elasticity of demand is particularly low (see Filippini 2011), this high value is
</p>
<p>intuitive. It also implies that an increase in the price of CO2 emission rights can be
</p>
<p>passed on to buyers more than proportionally (1.15 &frac14; 1.31�0.88). By way of
contrast, the CDS reduces to 9% for off-peak power, whose own-price elasticity
</p>
<p>of demand is higher. Accordingly, a higher price of CO2 emission cannot be fully
</p>
<p>passed on to buyers (0.96 &frac14; 1.09�0.88).

<p>According to Fig. 10.7DS and CDS have declined during the observation period.
</p>
<p>This is the likely consequence of successful efforts by the regulator designed to
</p>
<p>reduce the market power of German generators as well as the growing importance
</p>
<p>of renewable electricity generation, which both put pressure on wholesale electric-
</p>
<p>ity prices. While the clean dark spread was still positive most of the time up to 2014,
</p>
<p>it was no longer sufficient to justify investment in coal-fired power plants (see Sect.
</p>
<p>12.3.3 for a discussion of capacity investment in deregulated markets for electric-
</p>
<p>ity). It is important to note that this situation cannot be attributed to the EU-ETS, as
</p>
<p>higher CO2 prices can be passed on just about one-to-one to the purchasers of
</p>
<p>electricity on the wholesale market, as shown above.
</p>
<p>10.3.3 Coal Perspectives
</p>
<p>Prices for CO2 emission rights have been quite low in recent times (see Fig. 10.6
</p>
<p>again). They thus do not create an economic incentive to develop clean coal
</p>
<p>technologies that would allow stabilizing and reducing greenhouse gas emissions
</p>
<p>while using the abundant global coal resources. In addition, coal-fired electricity
</p>
<p>generation has average fuel efficiencies below 35%. If it could be raised to 45% (the
</p>
<p>value characterizing modern power stations), global CO2 emissions from this
</p>
<p>source could be reduced by 25%. Given that global CO2 emissions amounted to
</p>
<p>an estimated 14.8 bn tons in 2013 (IEA 2016), the reduction would be at least 3.7 bn
</p>
<p>tons per year.
</p>
<p>However, at CO2 prices above 50 to 70 EUR/tons, analysts predict that carbon
</p>
<p>capture would become an attractive option for operators of coal-fired power plants.
</p>
<p>The following alternatives are being discussed.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Post-combustion capture: The CO2 is washed out of the flue gas after combus-
</p>
<p>tion. A retrofitting of existing power plants is possible, but with the downside of
</p>
<p>reduced fuel efficiency.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Pre-combustion capture: CO2 is removed from coal (and fossil fuels more
</p>
<p>generally) before combustion. One option is to use integrated coal gasification
</p>
<p>technologies (IGCC) such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis which produces
</p>
<p>so-called synthesis gas under high temperature and pressure. The gas is a
</p>
<p>mixture of hydrogen H2, carbon monoxide CO, carbon dioxide CO2, and smaller
</p>
<p>amounts of other gaseous components, such as methane CH4. The so-called
</p>
<p>water-gas shift reaction uses the remaining CO and water H2O as inputs that are
</p>
<p>converted into H2 and CO2. By capturing and separating the CO2, the remaining
</p>
<p>H2-rich fuel can be used in combustion processes without any greenhouse gas
</p>
<p>emissions.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Flue gas capture: Coal is burned using pure oxygen O2 rather than air. The flue
</p>
<p>gas contains only steam and CO2, which can easily be separated.
</p>
<p>For these technologies to be environmentally friendly, a release of the captured
</p>
<p>CO2 into the atmosphere must be avoided. Apart from non-energetic uses of CO2, a

<p>solution widely discussed is underground storage (carbon capture and storage

<p>extraction, with exhausted gas fields serving as storage locations. Yet carbon-
</p>
<p>capture technologies are generally far from being mature, a state of affairs unlikely

<p>to change as long as the price of CO2 emissions remains low.

<p>Uranium and Nuclear Energy 11
</p>
<p>The peaceful use of nuclear energy began in the 1950s with the assumption that it
</p>
<p>would make electricity abundantly available at low cost. However, mistrust of this
</p>
<p>energy technology has been salient from its beginnings. After the nuclear catastro-
</p>
<p>phe of 1986 in Chernobyl, Ukraine, public acceptance of nuclear energy plummeted
</p>
<p>in industrial countries even though the Chernobyl reactor was of a very different
</p>
<p>design from those common in Western models. The following issues are addressed
</p>
<p>in this chapter:
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the risks of accidents in nuclear power plants from a technical
</p>
<p>perspective?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the dimensions of potential damages?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What type of risk assessment does the economic model lead to in the case of
</p>
<p>nuclear power?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What insurance premiums are to be expected if nuclear risks are to be
</p>
<p>internalized?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Are the risks of nuclear power plants insurable at all?
</p>
<p>If a reassessment of nuclear power is taking place today, it is because greenhouse
</p>
<p>gas emissions and the need for an active climate protection policy combine with
</p>
<p>concerns regarding energy supply security. Such a reassessment gives rise to an
</p>
<p>additional set of questions:
</p>
<p>&ndash; How long are uranium reserves expected to last?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the costs of uranium fuels, and what are their major components?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Is the industrial structure of the uranium market competitive or rather
</p>
<p>monopolistic?
</p>
<p>Finally, there are issues such as the secure final disposal of radioactive waste as
</p>
<p>well the dangers of proliferation of nuclear fuels for military purposes. These

<p>11.1 The Foundations of Nuclear Technology
</p>
<p>The technical application of nuclear power is based on the discovery of Albert
</p>
<p>Einstein at the beginning of the twentieth century, stating that mass can be
</p>
<p>transformed into energy. Energy extraction from mass could 1 day become possible
</p>
<p>through the fusion of light atoms (for example, hydrogen) to heavier atoms (for
</p>
<p>example, helium). In contrast, contemporary nuclear power generation uses fission
</p>
<p>of rather heavy atoms (with an uneven number of neutrons) into lighter atoms. The
</p>

</p>
<p>Table 11.1. The &lsquo;Atoms for Peace&rsquo; speech of 1953 epitomizes the significant
</p>
<p>governmental support for nuclear technology. Initially motivated by military
</p>
<p>interests, later made available for civilian purposes, the large-scale application of
</p>
<p>light-water technology (which dominates the present electricity generation of
</p>
<p>nuclear power plants) would not have materialized.
</p>
<p>In nuclear power plants, thermal energy produced by nuclear fission is used to
</p>
<p>activate a Carnot process (see Sect. 2.2.2). The most widespread commercial
</p>
<p>reactor type is the light-water reactor (LWR), which comes in two common
</p>
<p>variants. In the boiling water reactor, steam with a pressure of about 70 bar and a
</p>
<p>temperature of 290 �C is led directly to a steam turbine. Having done its work, the
</p>
<p>steam cools down to become water. In the pressurized water reactor, there are two
</p>
<p>cooling circuits, one of them separated from the nuclear reaction. A pressure of
</p>
<p>150&ndash;160 bar in the primary cooling circuit prevents the vaporization of the water,
</p>
<p>which is conducted into a steam generator. There, it is cooled down before returning
</p>
<p>to the nuclear reactor. The steam generator produces saturated steam, which drives

</p>
<p>About 90% of the 440 nuclear reactors in operation worldwide are of the LWR
</p>
<p>type. Installed capacities of a block vary between 300 and 1600 MW, compared to
</p>
<p>8 MW of the wind turbine with the highest performance as of 2016. In many cases,
</p>
<p>several blocks are combined to form a nuclear site. Total installed net capacity of
</p>
<p>nuclear power plants reaches 370,000 MWworldwide, representing 14% of thermal
</p>
<p>power plant capacity. In 2014, nuclear power plants generated almost 2.6 mn MWh
</p>
<p>of electrical energy (16% of global power generation, with Europe accounting for
</p>
<p>3.3 mn MWh). Particularly in the 1980s, electricity generation through nuclear
</p>
<p>power plants boomed in response to the two oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979.
</p>
<p>However, the Chernobyl accident of 1986 caused most Western countries to impose
</p>
<p>a moratorium or at least slow down on new power plant construction. Until
</p>
<p>recently, the increase in nuclear energy production since 1990 has been mainly
</p>
<p>the result of a more efficient operation of existing reactors in the United States and
</p>
<p>in Europe.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Three types of radioactivity can be distinguished.
</p>
<p>&ndash; α radiation (helium nuclei): An α particle usually provides an amount of energy
</p>
<p>between 0.005 to 0.006 eV (electronvolt; 1 eV &frac14; 1.6 � 10�19 J). This type of
radiation is short-range only so it can easily be shielded, e.g. using a sheet of
</p>
<p>paper.
</p>
<p>&ndash; β radiation (electrons): The energy of β particles lies in the range of
</p>
<p>0.0001&ndash;0.002 eV and can be absorbed by a metal plate with a thickness of a
</p>
<p>few millimeters.
</p>
<p>&ndash; γ radiation (photons, i.e. quants of electromagnetic radiation): γ radiation derives
</p>
<p>from the excess energy produced by nuclear decay in the fission processes
</p>
<p>(which also gives rise to α or β radiation). Its energy lies in the range of
</p>
<p>0.0001 and 0.005 eV. Shielding from it is technically demanding and requires
</p>
<p>heavy materials such as lead or concrete.
</p>
<p>To account for these differences, one distinguishes between the energy dose
</p>
<p>(Gray, Gy) and the radiation equivalent dose (Sievert, Sv). The latter attributes a
</p>
<p>weight of 1 to β and γ radiation but of 20 to α radiation in order to reflect its
</p>
<p>particular biological harmfulness. In Europe, average natural radiation exposure of
</p>
<p>the human body is around 0.002 Sv per year. In addition, medical exposure through
</p>
<p>x-ray diagnostics in particular amounts to the same magnitude (Table 11.2).
</p>
<p>The energy of the emitted particles is absorbed by the surrounding matter.
</p>
<p>Thereby the atoms of these substances become ionized, causing a temperature
</p>
<p>increase. The ionization of living cells can change and even destroy them, resulting
</p>
<p>in radiation sickness. Inside the cell nucleus, radiation can also cause mutations and
</p>
<p>genetic damage.
</p>
<p>With regard to the living body, a distinction is made between external and
</p>
<p>internal radiation. Internal radiation is particularly dangerous, because it is related
</p>
<p>to the absorption of radioactive substances by the organism and thus to a continuous
</p>
<p>exposure to radiation. The health impacts depend on the organ accumulating the
</p>
<p>radioactive substances and on the duration of exposure.
</p>
<p>Human beings experience radiation sickness from a short-term equivalent dose
</p>
<p>of 0.5 Sv onwards, while cell mutations can already occur at a much lower value.
</p>
<p>The living organism has the ability to partly repair damages caused by radioactive
</p>
<p>radiation, provided overall radioactive exposure does not exceed certain limits. As

<p>there is no possibility of determining these limits experimentally, one falls back on
</p>
<p>the assumption that natural radioactive radiation is tolerable, neglecting large
</p>
<p>geographical differences.
</p>
<p>11.1.2 Uranium as the Dominant Fuel for Nuclear Power
</p>
<p>Due to its easy fissionability, the uranium isotope 235U is the most important nuclear
</p>
<p>fuel. The raw material is natural uranium ore, which consists of the isotope 238U
</p>
<p>(99.29%) and the isotope 235U (0.71%). The uranium isotope 235U can be split into
</p>
<p>lighter atoms by bombarding it with slow and low-energy neutrons. Fission of one
235U nucleus releases 3.2 � 10�11 J of heat (a consequence of the so-called mass
defect). With each fission, two or three new neutrons are created which induce the
</p>
<p>decay of further 235U-nuclei in the guise of a chain reaction. With the help of
</p>
<p>moderators, the neutrons are slowed down. In the LWR, the moderator is natural
</p>
<p>water, which is also used for discharging the heat produced by nuclear fission from
</p>
<p>the reactor vessel.1 The chain reaction is controlled and can be stopped using
</p>
<p>so-called control rods made of cadmium that partially absorb the neutrons.
</p>
<p>Producing uranium fuel is technically complex and associated with risks of
</p>
<p>radiation. Uranium mining constitutes the first step of the production chain. The
</p>
<p>extracted uranium oxide (U3O8, so-called yellowcake) has a uranium concentration
</p>
<p>of 60&ndash;85%. To achieve the required degree of purity of 99.95%, the uranium ore is
</p>
<p>dissolved in nitric acid, filtered, treated with chemical solvents, and reconverted
</p>
<p>into uranium oxide.
</p>
<p>In order to maintain the chain reaction in light-water reactors, concentration of
235U isotopes in the nuclear fuel needs to be increased from 0.71% to 3 to 4%.2 For
</p>
<p>this enrichment process, uranium oxide has to be converted into the gaseous
</p>
<p>uranium hexafluoride UF6, which is channeled to gas centrifuges. At this point
</p>
<p>the separation of 235U from 238 U isotopes proceeds by taking advantage of a
</p>
<p>difference in their molecular mass. It takes place in so-called separative work units
</p>
<p>(SWUs) and requires 50 kWh/kg of electricity. The enriched uranium hexafluoride
</p>
<p>is chemically reconverted into uranium oxide powder UO2, to be processed to
</p>
<p>uranium fuel rods.
</p>
<p>According to Table 11.3, the production cost of uranium fuel is 1880 USD/t UO2
as of 2016. One kilogram uranium oxide powder UO2 generates about 3400 GJ of
</p>
<p>heat (944.6 MWh heat), equivalent to about 315 MWh of electricity. Thus, the fuel
</p>
<p>cost of nuclear power amounts to 5.97 USD/MWh or 5.43 EUR/MWh, a rather low
</p>
<p>figure compared to fossil power plants (e.g. 40 EUR/MWh for gas-fired power
</p>
<p>plants).3
</p>
<p>1Other possible moderators are heavy water D2O or graphite
12C; in this case, the chain reaction
</p>
<p>also proceeds using natural uranium.
2For nuclear weapons an enrichment level of &gt;90% is necessary. Thus, weapons-grade material
can be converted to nuclear fuel by blending it with depleted uranium.
3A currency exchange rate of 1.1 USD/EUR is assumed for 2016.

<p>11.1 The Foundations of Nuclear Technology 251</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.1.3 Nuclear Waste
</p>
<p>Table 11.4 provides an overview of the transformation of 100 t of uranium fuel
</p>
<p>during a 3-year period of use in a nuclear reactor. Only part of the isotope 235U is
</p>
<p>split into lighter materials that can be used for generation. In addition, radioactive
</p>
<p>plutonium is produced from the isotope 238U, which partly decays during the 3-year
</p>
<p>period, releasing heat.
</p>
<p>Unlike the source material, used nuclear fuel is highly radioactive. It produces
</p>
<p>large amounts of residual heat (around 250 MWth in a nuclear power plant of 1400
</p>
<p>MWel capacity) even after the reactor is turned off. This heat has to be dissipated to
</p>
<p>prevent destruction of the reactor containment, causing the release of radioactive
</p>
<p>material into the environment.
</p>
<p>Usually, nuclear fuel rods are removed from the reactor after a 3-year period of
</p>
<p>use. At that time, the rods contain about 35 different chemical elements with about
</p>
<p>300 radioactive isotopes. After their removal, the spent rods are first stored in a
</p>
<p>water basin for several decades before being transferred to a reprocessing facility or
</p>
<p>a final waste deposit. During interim storage, short-lived isotopes lose most of their
</p>
<p>radioactivity. In contrast, plutonium isotopes (so-called transuranium isotopes)
</p>
<p>with their long half-life represent a source of long-term nuclear radiation.
</p>
<p>Table 11.5 shows the time profiles of the respective sources of radioactivity.
</p>
<p>During the reprocessing of used nuclear fuel rods, plutonium and unspent
</p>
<p>uranium isotope 235 U are removed, to be used in the production of new fuel
</p>
<p>rods which are of the mixed oxide (MOX) type. As a consequence, radioactivity of
</p>
<p>the remaining nuclear waste diminishes over time, thus reducing the cost of final
</p>
<p>waste disposal. On the other hand, reprocessing poses considerable safety
</p>
<p>challenges. It is also much more expensive than the direct disposal of nuclear
</p>
<p>waste, even when crediting the nuclear fuel recycled. Therefore, direct disposal
</p>
<p>of nuclear waste is the preferred alternative in many countries.
</p>
<p>For a classification of radioactive waste, besides radioactivity the heat arising
</p>
<p>from radioactive decay is also of importance. Given that the increase in temperature
</p>
<p>should not exceed 3 �C for geophysical reasons, about 95% of the volume of waste
</p>
<p>can be stored in a final deposit. This value includes waste associated with the later
</p>
<p>demolition of the power plant.

<p>However, the remaining 5% of radioactive substances (being isotopes) contain
</p>
<p>99% of the radioactivity, calling for a staggered system of artificial and natural
</p>
<p>barriers in geologically suitable final deposits for highly radioactive waste. Expo-
</p>
<p>sure to radiation at the surface should not exceed the limit of 0.1&ndash;0.3 millisievert
</p>
<p>(10&ndash;30 millirem) per year. At present, no final storage facility satisfying this
</p>
<p>requirement is in operation anywhere around the globe, implying that the cost of
</p>
<p>storage can only be estimated. According to the World Nuclear Association, it is in
</p>
<p>the range of 1 EUR/MWh generated electricity (in the case of direct waste disposal)
</p>
<p>and 1.50 EUR/MWh (after reprocessing). At a maximum, this amounts to
</p>
<p>one-fourth of the production cost of uranium fuel.
</p>
<p>To finance the final disposal of radioactive substances and the dismantling of
</p>
<p>nuclear power plants after their shutdown, plant operators often accrue reserves

</p>
<p>11.2 Uranium Market
</p>
<p>The Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD and the International Atomic Energy
</p>
<p>Agency (IAEA) of the United Nations publish a statistical compilation of global
</p>
<p>uranium reserves in biannual intervals, based on data provided by about 20 -
</p>
<p>uranium-producing countries (see Nuclear Energy Agency 2014). Taking into
</p>
<p>account that for a resource to become an economically relevant reserve, its sales
</p>
<p>price must at least cover the cost of extraction, several cost levels are distinguished.
</p>
<p>For instance, at a unit cost of 130 USD/kg U3O8 (a rather high value compared to
</p>
<p>extraction cost in 2016 according to Table 11.3), known uranium reserves are about
</p>
<p>5.9 mn tons.
</p>
<p>Global demand by nuclear power plants currently amounts to roughly 50,000
</p>
<p>tons of natural uranium per year (see Table 11.6). If this figure is compared to
</p>
<p>recoverable uranium reserves, a static range of more than 100 years can be inferred.
</p>
<p>Per MW of power plant capacity, the natural uranium requirement equals about
</p>
<p>160 kg on average per year (compare this to the 250,000 tons of hard coal per MW
</p>
<p>and year required by a typical coal-fired plant). More advanced reactors are likely to
</p>
<p>have an even lower specific uranium requirement. The Swedish Oskarshamm&times;3
</p>
<p>reactor with 1400 MW installed capacity may serve as an example. Following the
</p>
<p>repeal of the nuclear phase-out decision in Sweden, it was retrofitted to generate
</p>
<p>between 0.8 and 1.3 mn MWh electricity per ton of 235U, depending on mode of
</p>
<p>operation. This means that its uranium requirement may be as low as 18 g/MWh,
</p>
<p>30% below the global average cited in Table 11.6. This reduction results from an
</p>
<p>increase in thermal efficiency and a higher yield in 235U-combustion, due to an
</p>
<p>enrichment of the uranium fuel to more than 4% 235U.
</p>

</p>
<p>for uranium with that of global extraction. Between 1950 and 1970, production

<p>consistently exceeded global demand, something one is unlikely to observe in a
</p>
<p>competitive market. A plausible explanation is governmental stockpiling for mili-
</p>
<p>tary purposes (note that the pertinent time series ends after 1990). Even with the
</p>
<p>advent of nuclear power plants in the late 1960s, excess production continued for
</p>
<p>two decades. Nevertheless, the price of natural uranium rose to more than
</p>
<p>80 USD/kg during the second half of the 1970s due to expectations of a rapid
</p>
<p>expansion of global nuclear power capacities.4 Again, governmental stockpiling
</p>
<p>played a role as well, by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission who initially was the
</p>
<p>only supplier of enriched uranium in the western world. Westinghouse/Toshiba, the
</p>
<p>leading producer of nuclear power plants at the time, reinforced the price increase
</p>
<p>by purchasing uranium beyond its short-term requirements.
</p>
<p>However, expectations of a bright future for nuclear power were dashed in 1979
</p>
<p>when the accident at the pressurized water reactor of Three Mile Island
</p>
<p>(Pennsylvania, United States) occurred&mdash;with global uranium production reaching
</p>
<p>an all-time high just then. The drop in demand caused uranium production and price
</p>
<p>to fall, the latter to a level below 40 USD/kg. Pressure on price further intensified
</p>
<p>during the 1990s, when traders started selling Russian nuclear fuel on the world
</p>
<p>market. U.S. American and European restrictions of imports from Russia could not
</p>
<p>prevent a collapse to about 20 USD/kg, even though many uranium mines aban-
</p>
<p>doned their production at the time. While weapons-grade uranium became available
</p>
<p>for civilian use, there was still a shortfall of uranium supply relative to current
</p>
<p>requirements of nuclear power plants.
</p>
<p>Only after 2003 did this shortfall result in a hefty increase in the price of natural
</p>
<p>uranium. The price hike by a factor four is comparable to that in crude oil prices

<p>after 2000 (see Sect. 8.3). Reduced uranium exports of Russia and a series of
</p>
<p>accidents in uranium mines and processing plants contributed to this price explo-
</p>
<p>sion. While an acceleration of global uranium exploration and development has
</p>
<p>been observed lately, comparatively high prices are likely to persist because these
</p>
<p>investments take 5&ndash;7 years to affect production.
</p>
<p>Uranium production is heavily concentrated regionally, with only five countries
</p>
<p>accounting for three-fourths of it, namely Canada (28%), Australia (23%),
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan (9%), Nigeria, and Russia (8% each). The United States, just like
</p>
<p>China, produce their own uranium oxide but need imports to meet their demand.
</p>
<p>France, Japan, Germany, and Great Britain are entirely dependent on imports.
</p>
<p>Corporate concentration is marked as well, exceeding that in crude oil and coal
</p>
<p>markets. At the level of natural uranium extraction, the four largest companies
</p>
<p>currently have a joint market share of more than 60%. These are Cameco (Canada,
</p>
<p>20%), Rio Tinto (Australia, 20%), Areva (France, 12%), and BHP Billiton
</p>
<p>(Australia and Great Britain, 9%).
</p>
<p>At the level of uranium enrichment, the U.S. government allowed private
</p>
<p>possession of uranium only after 1968, and state monopolies have in fact persisted
</p>
<p>since then. The largest ones currently are the Russian TENEX (32% market share),
</p>
<p>the United States Enrichment Company (U.S. Department of Energy, 17%), and the
</p>
<p>French Areva (15%)&mdash;all government-controlled. Only the production of fuel rods
</p>
<p>has a competitive industry structure.
</p>
<p>This heavy governmental involvement is the likely reason that with the excep-
</p>
<p>tion of French Areva, there are no vertically integrated companies along the nuclear
</p>
<p>value chain in the western world. In fact, economic conditions (factor-specific
</p>
<p>assets, high transaction costs, and high supplier concentration) would favor such
</p>
<p>an industry structure (see Sects. 8.2.1 and 9.3.1). In spite of its consolidation during
</p>
<p>the 1990s, the industry is unlikely to become more vertically integrated in future in
</p>
<p>view of governmental reservations in particular against private uranium
</p>
<p>enrichment.
</p>
<p>Operators of power plants are the customers of the producers of nuclear fuel.
</p>
<p>Even at a historically high price of 130 USD/kg natural uranium, their variable fuel
</p>
<p>costs are very low compared to coal-fired and gas-fired power plants (see Sect.
</p>
<p>12.2.2). The cost of fuel being such a small part of the total, still higher uranium
</p>
<p>prices would not make them lose their competitiveness. In addition, most nuclear
</p>
<p>power plants are almost fully amortized, while fossil power plants are likely to be
</p>
<p>burdened by the cost of avoiding CO2 emissions in the near future.
</p>
<p>11.3 Risk Assessment of Nuclear Energy
</p>
<p>Risks associated with nuclear power are of three types. First, abuse of nuclear fuels
</p>
<p>(enriched uranium, plutonium) for military and terrorist purposes needs to be
</p>
<p>prevented effectively. Second, secure final waste disposal of radioactive substances
</p>
<p>needs to be guaranteed for a long period of time. Third, incidents in nuclear power
</p>
<p>plants must not lead to the release of large quantities of radioactive substances.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>All three risks are borne only in part by the operators of nuclear power plants&mdash;
</p>
<p>and ultimately by the consumers of electricity. Therefore, they constitute external
</p>
<p>effects of a stochastic nature. Economic efficiency in the management of such risks
</p>
<p>calls for an amount of preventive effort such that its certain marginal cost equals the
</p>
<p>expected value of marginal utility (for a discussion of this condition as well as ways
</p>
<p>to attain it, see Sect. 7.3), for example by imposing an internalization tax (so-called
</p>
<p>Pigou tax; see Fig. 7.4 in Sect. 7.3.1). However, such policy measures require
</p>
<p>knowledge of both the marginal cost and marginal utility schedules. Both of these
</p>
<p>schedules are extremely difficult to estimate.
</p>
<p>While economists generally are in favor of internalization through price (&lsquo;the
</p>
<p>polluter pays&rsquo; principle), they tend to prefer legal rules and norms in this instance to
</p>
<p>deal with the risks cited above.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Theft and abuse of nuclear fuels (enriched uranium, plutonium) for military and
</p>
<p>terrorist purposes: To decrease this risk, a surveillance system for nuclear power,
</p>
<p>enrichment, and reprocessing plants was created by the International Atomic
</p>
<p>Energy Agency IAEA. However, only countries who have ratified the Treaty on
</p>
<p>the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1970 submit themselves to this
</p>
<p>surveillance. Furthermore, even after ratification some countries have been
</p>
<p>conducting fairly advanced clandestine nuclear weapon programs. This
</p>
<p>demonstrates that fully-fledged surveillance is not possible in the long run.
</p>
<p>Finally, nongovernmental organizations increasingly possess both the financial
</p>
<p>means and knowledge necessary to acquire and use nuclear weaponry. The
</p>
<p>proliferation of nuclear weapons is thus difficult to prevent in the long run,
</p>
<p>calling for the consideration of additional instruments in security policy. How-
</p>
<p>ever, this issue is hardly related to the civilian use of nuclear power; indeed,
</p>
<p>countries without commercial nuclear power have been able to acquire nuclear
</p>
<p>weapons in the past. Thus, even a global phasing-out of nuclear power would not
</p>
<p>entirely eliminate the risk of proliferation.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Final disposal of radioactive waste from nuclear power plants: Spent fuel
</p>
<p>remains highly radioactive over a period of 100,000 years (see Sect. 11.1.3,
</p>
<p>particularly Table 11.5). There are technical procedures and geological deposits
</p>
<p>that prevent release of radioactivity into the biosphere even beyond periods that
</p>
<p>humans are able to foresee. However, if a discharge of radioactivity should occur
</p>
<p>far in future, neither plant operators, nor insurance companies, nor governments
</p>
<p>can be held liable. A possible solution could be the conversion of radioactive
</p>
<p>waste into less dangerous substances through irradiation with neutrons and
</p>
<p>protons (so-called artificial nuclear transmutation). However, at present not
</p>
<p>even commercial pilot projects are under way anywhere in the world.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Incidents in nuclear power plants: This risk category constitutes a different case.
</p>
<p>The peaceful use of nuclear power is based on the precondition that the release of
</p>
<p>radioactive substances is limited to an amount corresponding to the natural level
</p>
<p>of radioactivity. Permanent adherence to this precondition can be verified during
</p>
<p>the life of a nuclear power plant; given normal operation, it is satisfied. However,
</p>
<p>a severe incident can lead to the release of very large quantities of radioactive

</p>
<p>While they are characterized by a great deal of redundancy, they may fail with a
</p>
<p>very small probability. The following section is devoted to the estimation of this
</p>
<p>probability.
</p>
<p>11.3.1 Probabilistic Safety Analysis of Nuclear Power Plants
</p>
<p>Probabilistic safety analysis (PSA) is a procedure to determine the annual probabil-
</p>
<p>ity with which a particular system may fail. In the case of a nuclear power plant, the
</p>
<p>system should prevent the release of the plant&rsquo;s radioactive inventory (the so-called
</p>
<p>source term). PSA also seeks to quantify the corresponding damages in monetary
</p>
<p>units.5 This method, originally developed by Rasmussen et al. (1975), has become
</p>
<p>the most common procedure to calculate the operational risk of nuclear power
</p>
<p>plants (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 1991).
</p>
<p>The results of a probabilistic safety analysis are k loss scenarios with their
</p>
<p>estimated annual probabilities of occurrence wk and the respective damages Dk.
</p>
<p>For the case of the nuclear power plant M&uuml;hleberg in Switzerland, seven loss
</p>
<p>scenarios with an increasing source term are distinguished in Table 11.7.
</p>
<p>The so-called expected loss is given by

<p>the present context, it indicates the safety-related risk of a nuclear power plant. It is

<p>plant-specific, depending on reactor type, safety technology employed, and reactor
</p>
<p>site (because of weather conditions and population density in its vicinity). Since
</p>
<p>radioactive inventory increases with plant capacity, E[D] is usually related to the
</p>
<p>annual amount of electricity generated, a very large quantity. For this reason, the
</p>
<p>values shown in Table 11.8 are just fractions of U.S. cents per kWh.
</p>
<p>These values (see Table 11.8) are often used as a measure of the external cost of
</p>
<p>operation imposed on society by nuclear power plants because most of the damage
</p>
<p>is suffered by individuals who have no economic relationship with the plant. They
</p>
<p>are so small that the internalization of these stochastic externalities through a Pigou
</p>
<p>tax (see Sect. 7.3.1) would not affect the competitiveness of nuclear power vis-à-vis
</p>
<p>other power generation technologies.
</p>
<p>For many engineers and physicists associated with nuclear technology, the lack
</p>
<p>of acceptance of nuclear energy-related risks by large parts of the population seems
</p>
<p>irrational. They turn to psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, and
</p>
<p>philosophers with the request to scientifically analyze the seemingly irrational
</p>
<p>behavior of specific social groups. However, this request emanates from a neglect
</p>
<p>of standard economic theory. For simplicity, let damage be measured in terms of the
</p>
<p>number of premature deaths D occurring with probability w. There is a choice
</p>
<p>between technologies which differ with regard to these two parameters. One of
</p>
<p>them is a coal-fired plant that causes 20 premature deaths due to air pollution with
</p>
<p>probability w&frac14; 0.05, resulting in E[D]&frac14; 1 (the actual probability is much closer to
w &frac14; 1.00, but this would complicate calculations). Another is the LWR; with
probability w &frac14; 10�5, it causes the death of 100,000 persons, resulting also in E
[D] &frac14; 1 (both values are on the high side but simplify calculations). Now engineers
and physicists associated with nuclear technology typically argue that the two
</p>
<p>technologies (and in fact all technologies and their combinations with the same
</p>
<p>expected loss of E[D]&frac14; 1) should be viewed as equivalent. In Fig. 11.2, they are all
on the same hyperbolic locus (note that w�D &frac14; 1 implies w &frac14; 1/D), constituting the
feasibility frontier. Coal-based generation is represented by point C, the nuclear
</p>
<p>alternative, by point N.
</p>
<p>Yet people have preferences regarding the choice of technology. Let there be
</p>
<p>just two types of people, I and II. Their preferences are depicted by indifference
</p>
<p>curves, along which expected utility is constant. The direction of preference is
</p>
<p>indicated by arrows which point to the origin since (w &frac14; 0, D &frac14; 0) constitutes the

<p>best imaginable situation for both types. This implies that for type I, the tangency
</p>
<p>point N is the optimal choice, involving exclusive reliance on nuclear power but no
</p>
<p>use of coal. For type II however, generation of electricity should optimally be by
</p>
<p>coal only.
</p>
<p>Neither type I nor type II is irrational. The concavity of their indifference curves
</p>
<p>(more easily discernible for type I) indicates that when they have to accept a higher
</p>
<p>number of deaths, they both need to be compensated by an increasingly marked
</p>
<p>reduction in the probability of occurrence&mdash;a very intuitive assumption. However,
</p>
<p>type I would be willing to trade off a small decrease in the number of deaths D in
</p>
<p>return for a very small increase in the probability w only. For instance, he or she
</p>
<p>may have most relatives and friends living in the vicinity of the power plant,
</p>
<p>creating a particular interest in the survival of relatively few individuals. By way
</p>
<p>of contrast, type II would be willing to trade off the same decrease in the number of
</p>
<p>deaths D against a substantial increase in w. This type may have relatives and
</p>
<p>friends living spread out all over the world; only his or her survival is at stake. Note
</p>
<p>that sociological surveys are unlikely to identify the difference between the two
</p>
<p>types because they fail to confront respondents with the trade-off involved. If asked,
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you find an energy-generating technology that may kill 100,000 people
</p>
<p>acceptable?&rdquo;, they will of course say &lsquo;No&rsquo;. They may respond differently if made
</p>
<p>aware that the alternative is a technology that kills 20 people with a much higher
</p>
<p>probability (in reality, almost with certainty).
</p>
<p>11.3.2 Risk Assessment According to the (m, s2) Criterion
</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, an internalization tax equal to the value of the
</p>
<p>expected loss as given by Eq. (11.2) would not bring about the welfare maximum in

<p>relation to the use of nuclear power. Recall that the appropriate condition states that

<p>the marginal cost of effort undertaken for risk prevention should be equal to its
</p>
<p>marginal utility in terms of risks reduction. However, marginal cost of effort is not
</p>
<p>directly related to expected loss while marginal utility is a subjective quantity. If a
</p>
<p>market for the prevention of nuclear risk existed (including the purchase of insur-
</p>
<p>ance coverage by private households), one would know that buyers&rsquo; marginal utility
</p>
<p>is at least as high as the observed market price. Equivalently, their marginal
</p>
<p>willingness to pay (WTP) would be at least as high as the market price. Since no
</p>
<p>such market exists, one has to look for other ways to measure WTP.
</p>
<p>A first approach is the so-called (μ, σ2)-criterion which is popular for describing
</p>
<p>the behavior of risk-averse investors in capital markets. Its mathematical formula-
</p>
<p>tion can be traced back to Pratt (1964) and Arrow (1974) and amounts to a version
</p>
<p>of expected utility theory (see Sect. 3.5). According to it, the willingness of person
</p>
<p>i to pay for risk avoidance (denoted by Ri) is given by the expected loss μi the person
</p>
<p>is exposed to plus a surcharge that depends on the variance σi
2 of the possible loss
</p>
<p>and the individual&rsquo;s degree of subjective risk aversion avi,

</p>
<p>The so-called coefficient of absolute risk aversion avi depends on U
0
i(Wi), the
</p>
<p>curvature of the individual&rsquo;s risk utility functionUi(Wi) which is a function of assets
</p>
<p>at risk Wi. In the context of the risks associated with nuclear power, willingness to
</p>
<p>pay of course importantly reflects concerns for health and survival. However, note
</p>
<p>that these concerns can be integrated by making the Ui(Wi) function dependent on
</p>
<p>the state of health, see Zweifel and Eisen (2012). For marginal utility, one has
</p>
<p>U0i(Wi) &gt; 0, while the second derivative U
00
i(Wi) depends on the individual&rsquo;s risk
</p>
<p>preference. IfU00i(Wi)&gt; 0, the individual is risk-seeking, ifU
00
i(Wi)&frac14; 0, he or she is
</p>
<p>risk-neutral. However, for a risk-averse individual, the second derivation is
</p>
<p>negative,
</p>
<p>U00i Wi&eth; &THORN; &lt; 0: &eth;11:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>This implies that the person values a loss of assets more heavily than an equally
</p>
<p>probable gain of the same amount. From Eq. (11.3), one therefore has avi(Wi) &gt;
0 given risk aversion but avi(W ) &frac14; 0 given risk neutrality.

<p>At the macroeconomic level, willingness to pay for the avoidance of nuclear risk

<p>Although commonly used in transitions from the microeconomic to the macro-
</p>
<p>economic level, assumptions of this type are admittedly not very realistic. In fact,
</p>
<p>they cut the social evaluation problem down to the willingness to pay of a repre-
</p>
<p>sentative individual for the avoidance of risk. However, such simplifications are
</p>
<p>helpful as a first step to estimate the magnitude of an aggregate willingness to pay
</p>
<p>value.
</p>
<p>For an empirical implementation of Eq. (11.6), a value for the coefficient of
</p>
<p>absolute risk aversion av(W ) characterizing a society is needed. One way to infer a
</p>
<p>society&rsquo;s degree of risk aversion is to analyze the share of its assets it chooses to
</p>
<p>insure. This was done by Szipiro (1986) for a number of industrial countries.6
</p>
<p>Applying his estimate to the Swiss population, Zweifel and Nocera (1994) derived
</p>
<p>av(W ) to be between 5 � 10�5 and 7 � 10�5 per CHF. Using the 1994 conversion rate
of 1.61 CHF/EUR, one obtains an interval for av(W ) of
</p>
<p>8:1� 10�5per EUR &lt; av W&eth; &THORN; &lt; 11:3 � 10�5 per EUR &eth;11:7&THORN;

<p>Although these are very small values, when multiplied with the variance of
</p>
<p>aggregate loss (which is huge), the surcharge over expected loss POP � μ in
Eq. (11.6) becomes sizable. Therefore, the view of engineers and physicists that
</p>
<p>expected loss is sufficient for assessing the risk of energy-related technologies is
</p>
<p>refuted (see Sect. 11.3.1).
</p>
<p>This insight can be deepened by taking up the notion, touched upon in Sect.
</p>
<p>11.3.1, that people do not care about their own health and survival only but also
</p>
<p>about that of relatives and friends. The results of the probabilistic safety analysis
</p>
<p>applied to the Swiss nuclear power plant M&uuml;hleberg (see Table 11.7) may serve as
</p>
<p>the point of departure. By dividing expected loss E[D] by the number of persons
</p>
<p>POP exposed to the risk, one obtains an estimate of expected loss at the individual
</p>
<p>level,
</p>
<p>μi &frac14;

<p>Now assume that people not only consider their own expected loss μi, but also
</p>
<p>that of 100 other persons μj, with j 6&frac14; i (e.g. relatives, neighbors, friends,
colleagues). Let their risk utility function be of the logarithmic type (it qualifies

</p>
<p>dealing with human life and health. This issue is discussed in Sect. 7.4.

<p>Returning to aggregate values, one sees that Eq. (11.6) needs to be modified by

<p>Using the interval (11.7) for av(W ) and the M&uuml;hleberg data for low and high

</p>
<p>between 3.3 mn and 247.0 mn EUR per year.
</p>
<p>Up until now the fact has been ignored that nuclear contamination persists over

<p>long periods (at least many decades) when estimating willingness to pay (even
</p>
<p>though probabilities wk are given as frequencies per year). However, due to the
</p>
<p>long-term impact of nuclear contamination, insurance companies do not need to
</p>
<p>provide the entire sum of total remuneration payments immediately. Instead, they
</p>
<p>can distribute remuneration payments over a relatively long period (following the
</p>
<p>distribution of damages over time). Assuming a uniform distribution of damage

</p>
<p>In 1994, the Swiss population was about 7 mn. Using the data for the M&uuml;hleberg
</p>
<p>plant provided in Table 11.7 and applying Eq. (11.14), one can estimate adjusted
</p>
<p>aggregate willingness to pay,
</p>
<p>0:8 mn EUR=a &lt; bR &lt; 21:7 mn EUR=a: &eth;11:15&THORN;
</p>
<p>Dividing these figures by the annual electricity production in the M&uuml;hleberg
</p>
<p>plant (about 2500 mn kWh), willingness to pay is bounded by 0.0003 and 0.0087
</p>
<p>EUR/kWh. To the extent that financial reserves of plant operators are insufficient
</p>
<p>for the payment of possible nuclear damages, these figures also represent the
</p>
<p>external cost of nuclear power. With figures this low, the introduction of internali-
</p>
<p>zation taxes would not affect the competitiveness of nuclear power.7
</p>
<p>Even though estimated external effects can be internalized through taxes on
</p>
<p>nuclear power, the population still rejects nuclear energy in many cases. An
</p>
<p>explanation of this could lie in an incorrect estimation of willingness to pay using
</p>
<p>the (μ, σ2)-criterion which assumes variance of damage to be finite. It is question-
</p>
<p>able whether this assumption is correct when assessing risks associated with the
</p>
<p>current generation of nuclear plants. However, this might change with
</p>
<p>improvements of the safety technology in future reactor generations.
</p>
<p>11.3.3 Risk Assessment Based on Stated Preferences
</p>
<p>The (μ, σ2)-criterion presented in the previous section constitutes an attempt to base
</p>
<p>risk assessment as far as possible on objective quantities. However, in the determi-
</p>
<p>nation of willingness to pay (WTP) for risk reduction, av(W ) enters, a subjective
</p>
<p>parameter. Moreover, values of av(W ) derived from e.g. insurance data may not be
</p>
<p>applicable to the present context, where not only survival but also the health of
</p>
<p>relatives and friends are at stake. In this situation, determining WTP through
</p>
<p>experiments may be worthwhile. A popular alternative is the discrete choice
</p>
<p>experiment, in which participants repeatedly choose between two alternatives,
</p>
<p>one of them typically the status quo. The status quo is described by a set of
</p>
<p>attributes, while the alternative features attribute levels that vary in the course of
</p>
<p>the experiment. If one of these attributes is the price to be paid, WTP values for the
</p>
<p>other attributes (and hence for the alternative as a whole) can be inferred using
</p>
<p>econometric methods. Admittedly, discrete choice experiments measure only stated
</p>
<p>preferences rather than preferences revealed through actual choices in markets.
</p>
<p>7Since 2003, electricity consumers in Germany and Austria connected to a low-voltage grid have
</p>
<p>been paying an environmental tax of about 0.021 EUR/kWh, which however does not differentiate
</p>
<p>between power plant types, and thus lacks an incentive effect.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>However, a market for nuclear risk reduction (e.g. insurance against risks of nuclear
</p>
<p>power) does not exist for private households.
</p>
<p>A discrete choice experiment designed to measure WTP for a reduction of
</p>
<p>financial risk emanating from nuclear power was conducted by Schneider and
</p>
<p>Zweifel (2004), involving 500 Swiss participants. In accordance with the theory
</p>
<p>of consumer demand developed by Lancaster (1966), the product &lsquo;electricity&rsquo; was
</p>
<p>described by five attributes,
</p>
<p>&ndash; Financial damage per household in case of a severe accident;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Problem of final nuclear waste disposal solved/not solved;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Average number of power interruptions per year;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Coverage ratio of liability insurance to be purchased by nuclear plant operators
</p>
<p>for payment of damages to households;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Price of electricity at the household level.
</p>
<p>The damage probability does not appear as an attribute here; this is supposed to
</p>
<p>prevent the danger of inconsistent statements made by the participants. In many
</p>
<p>former experimental designs, it was noticed that the interviewees gave inconsistent
</p>
<p>answers when probabilities changed (the so-called Allais paradox).
</p>
<p>As is well known, the slope of an indifference curve indicates how much the
</p>
<p>individual considered is willing to sacrifice of one good (attribute, respectively) in
</p>
<p>return for obtaining one unit of the other. In the present context, the slope of the
</p>
<p>indifference curve through the status quo shows how much disposable income
</p>
<p>(through paying a higher price for electricity) a respondent is willing to sacrifice
</p>
<p>in return for a higher degree of financial protection through a higher coverage ratio
</p>
<p>in plant operators&rsquo; liability insurance. Therefore, respondents&rsquo; repeated choices
</p>
<p>between the status quo and an alternative permit the experimenter to identify their
</p>
<p>indifference curves and with them, their marginal WTP in the neighborhood of the
</p>
<p>status quo.
</p>
<p>Schneider and Zweifel (2004) estimated a value of 0.0012 EUR/kWh as the
</p>
<p>marginal WTP of the Swiss population for an increase of liability coverage from
</p>
<p>0.55 bn EUR (the status quo) to 1.2 bn EUR per nuclear plant. They also found that
</p>
<p>marginal WTP decreased with the coverage ratio, as predicted by economic theory
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 11.3, with a linearized function for simplicity). Moreover, it reached zero
</p>
<p>at 100% coverage, which is intuitive because there is no financial risk anymore at
</p>
<p>that point. Most importantly, cumulated marginal WTP between 0.55 and 1.2 bn
</p>
<p>EUR clearly exceeded the estimated cost of a corresponding extension of liability
</p>
<p>coverage. Marginal utility can therefore be said to be at least as high as marginal
</p>
<p>cost, justifying the extra preventive effort from an efficiency perspective.
</p>
<p>Maximum damage has been estimated to reach (and even exceed) 100 bn EUR.
</p>
<p>Using this value, one obtains willingness to pay of 0.092 EUR/kWh for the increase
</p>
<p>of liability coverage from 0.55 to 1.2 bn EUR as the integral of the marginal WTP
</p>
<p>schedule (see Eq. (11.16)),
</p>

</p>
<p>This is a lot more than the 0.0087 EUR/kWh derived from the (μ, σ2)-criterion. If
</p>
<p>nuclear power plants had to pay an internalization tax of this magnitude, they would
</p>
<p>not be competitive anymore on the market for electricity generation. Yet Schneider
</p>
<p>and Zweifel (2004) cite an estimate according to which additional insurance
</p>
<p>coverage up to even more than 1.2 bn EUR could cost as little as 0.007 EUR/kWh.
</p>
<p>Still, the result of this discrete choice experiment reflects the prevalent
</p>
<p>non-acceptance of nuclear energy, at least in Switzerland.
</p>
<p>At the same time, the experiment provides evidence that 100% liability coverage
</p>
<p>does not represent the optimum amount of internalization when it comes to the risks
</p>
<p>of nuclear power.8 For efficiency, insurance coverage should be such that its
</p>
<p>marginal cost (the additional insurance premium) equals to marginal willingness
</p>
<p>to pay. According to the authors, this equality would be reached through a fivefold
</p>
<p>increase of coverage, from 0.55 bn to 2.75 bn EUR.
</p>
<p>In some countries, liability insurance coverage is not provided by insurance
</p>
<p>companies but mutually by nuclear plant operators. In the United States in particu-
</p>
<p>lar, there is the so-called joint and several liability rule which mandates all
</p>
<p>operators to contribute to the payment of damages caused by one of them. In
</p>
<p>Germany, nuclear liability has three layers which in combination approximate the
</p>
<p>optimal amount of coverage as calculated by Schneider and Zweifel (2004):
</p>
<p>&ndash; Private liability insurance (limit of 260 mn EUR per accident);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Joint and several liability among plant operators (2244 bn EUR of liquid assets);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Liability of plant owners including their holding companies with their total
</p>
<p>assets (amount unknown but huge).
</p>
<p>Yet in spite of such an extremely high degree of coverage, acceptance of nuclear
</p>
<p>power in Germany is limited, evidenced by its government&rsquo;s decision to exit from

<p>Markets for Electricity 12
</p>
<p>The electric value chain consists of the following elements: generation, wholesale
</p>
<p>trade, transmission, distribution, marketing, and metering. In many countries
</p>
<p>around the world, vertically integrated utilities used to assume all of these functions
</p>
<p>similar to the vertically integrated companies in other energy sectors (see Sect.
</p>
<p>8.2.1). For several reasons, the European Union has mandated the electric industry
</p>
<p>to unbundle the grid from its other activities along the value chain (see Sect.
</p>
<p>13.2.4). Therefore, it seems reasonable to structure the economic analysis of
</p>
<p>power markets accordingly. In this chapter the economic aspects of electricity
</p>
<p>generation and sales are discussed, whereas Chap. 13 is devoted to the economics
</p>
<p>of transmission and distribution.
</p>
<p>For the time being, storing electricity is practically impossible in view of its cost.
</p>
<p>Therefore, electricity generation and electricity consumption must be synchronized
</p>
<p>continuously. In order to secure the supply of electrical energy for all customers, it
</p>
<p>is necessary to permanently maintain an amount of capacity in power generation
</p>
<p>which exceeds the maximum load.
</p>
<p>Starting in the 1990s, the electricity industry (especially the generation sector)
</p>
<p>has been liberalized in many countries. This move, combined with the growing
</p>
<p>share of electricity from renewable sources and distributed generation, has led to a
</p>
<p>major transformation that continues to this day. Based on the experience gained
</p>
<p>from these recent developments, the following issues are addressed in this chapter:
</p>
<p>&ndash; How might electricity markets work in a competitive business environment,
</p>
<p>although power has to be delivered through a single grid?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What does generation dispatch look like in a competitive market?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the particularities and pricing mechanisms of power exchanges?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How can sufficient investment in backup and excess capacities be secured?
</p>
<p>&ndash; How can the abuse of market power in the generation market be prevented?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the possibilities to manage the transformation to &lsquo;green&rsquo; power
</p>
<p>generation?

<p>12.1 Features of Electricity Markets
</p>
<p>Electric power is based on the directed movement of electrons. Key parameters are
</p>
<p>the rate of electrical charge measured in amperes (A) and the electrical voltage (V),
</p>
<p>which determines the force ensuring the flow of electric charge. The product of the
</p>
<p>two is electric power measured in kilowatts (kW) or megawatts (MW).1 By
</p>
<p>multiplying electric power by a time unit (e.g. 1 h), one obtains electric work
</p>
<p>1For combined heat and power plants, a distinction is made between thermal capacity (measured in
</p>
<p>MWth) and electric capacity (measured in MWel).
</p>
<p>270 12 Markets for Electricity</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) or megawatt-hours (MWh), respectively (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 2.1.1).
</p>
<p>As the supply of electricity is characterized by constant frequency and voltage,
</p>
<p>electric power and electric work are homogeneous products from a physical point of
</p>
<p>view. From an economic point of view, however, electricity is not so homogeneous,
</p>
<p>as evidenced by prices that exhibit both substantial fluctuations over time and
</p>
<p>differences between geographical areas. Economic heterogeneity is a core aspect
</p>
<p>of the economic analysis of electricity markets, to be discussed in Sect. 12.2.
</p>
<p>12.1.1 The Consumer Surplus of Electricity
</p>
<p>Electricity has particular features that no other energy source can offer:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Electricity is the energy source with maximum exergy. Thus, electric
</p>
<p>applications, such as electric motors, have higher energetic efficiencies than
</p>
<p>fossil-energy applications.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The laws of thermodynamics impose no limit on energy density. Therefore,
</p>
<p>electricity can be used to produce extremely high temperatures.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Being the energy of an electromagnetic field, electricity is a virtually mass-free
</p>
<p>energy source. It therefore has excellent switch-on/switch-off properties, a basic
</p>
<p>requirement for signal processing and transmission.
</p>
<p>&ndash; With the exception of electric smog and some heat and noise emissions, the
</p>
<p>environmental impact of electricity at the point of use is negligible.
</p>
<p>As a result of these properties, substitutability of electricity by other energy
</p>
<p>sources is rather limited (e.g. in the case of light) and sometimes even impossible
</p>
<p>(e.g. in the case of information technology) as shown by Praktiknjo (2014). Thus
</p>
<p>the own price elasticity of electricity demand is rather low. Many kilowatt-hours
</p>
<p>would even be purchased at a price which exceeds current levels by a factor of 50.
</p>
<p>From an economic viewpoint, this implies that electricity markets are characterized
</p>
<p>by a very high consumer surplus (CS). This high consumer surplus becomes
</p>
<p>particularly evident when it is lost because of blackouts (so-called value of lost
</p>
<p>load (VOLL), see Praktiknjo 2013). To recoup part of it, consumers may eventually
</p>
<p>resort to auto-generation of electricity even if the associated cost exceeds the
</p>
<p>electricity price delivered by the grid.
</p>
<p>The aggregate demand function Q( pend) relates consumption to the end price
</p>
<p>paid by consumers. It can be transformed to become the inverted demand function
</p>
<p>pend(Q) which describes the end price as a function of quantity. Consumer surplus
</p>
<p>CS can be calculated for each market constellation ( p*end, Q
*) by either one of the
</p>
<p>two following integrals

</p>
<p>long as the marginal willingness to pay as expressed by the demand function
</p>

</p>
<p>willingness to pay of consumers cumulated over all quantities up to Q* minus their
</p>

</p>
<p>12.1.2 Non-storability of Electricity
</p>
<p>As with many other goods and services, the demand for electricity is subject to
</p>
<p>daily, weekly, and seasonal fluctuations. Typical daily load profiles for northern
</p>
<p>countries are shown in Fig. 12.1. Winter demand (with daily peaks during the
</p>
<p>evening hours) is usually higher than summer demand (with daily peaks around
</p>
<p>noon). During typical spring and autumn days, load profiles differ as well. In
</p>
<p>southern regions, they may look quite different because of a lower demand for
</p>
<p>heating but higher demand for cooling.
</p>
<p>Facing fluctuating demand, suppliers would ideally try to pursue the following
</p>
<p>strategies:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Storing in times of low (off-peak) demand and withdrawing in times of high
</p>
<p>(peak) demand;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Varying service quality using interruptible contracts and other load management
</p>
<p>measures;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Price differentiation designed to shift demand from peak to off-peak periods.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Even though all of these strategies are to some extent employed (particularly for
</p>
<p>serving industrial customers), daily load curves are far from being levelized. There
</p>
<p>are two reasons for this. First, using currently available technologies, large-scale
</p>
<p>power storage is not economically viable yet.2 Second, there has not been a roll-out
</p>
<p>of smart meters on a massive scale. Smart meters are capable of quasi-continuous
</p>
<p>metering as well as bidirectional communication between customer and utility.
</p>
<p>Thus, they are necessary for the introduction of interruptible contracts and flexible
</p>
<p>time-of-use tariffs or&mdash;more ambitiously still&mdash;real-time pricing.3
</p>
<p>Today, power retailers mostly offer uniform tariffs, where price is independent
</p>
<p>of time and actual state of the market. With a growing share of intermittent
</p>
<p>generation (e.g. wind and solar), flexible tariff structures will become even more
</p>
<p>useful. However, their introduction conflicts with the way power is retailed. Pres-
</p>
<p>ently, retail customers are characterized by and supplied according to a predefined
</p>
<p>standard load profile (SLP). In a SLP, a theoretical annual consumption of 1 MWh
</p>
<p>is proportionally distributed over all 365�25�4 &frac14; 35,040 quarter hours of a year.
After multiplication by the total annual electricity demand of the customer, the SLP
</p>
<p>determines the amount of electricity the retail supplier will have to provide during
</p>
<p>each quarter hour. This system offers an efficient way for dealing with customers
</p>
<p>who shift their supplier by enabling the transfer of crucial information, though it
</p>
<p>excludes effective load management.
</p>
<p>12.1.3 Power Market Design Options
</p>
<p>Before their liberalization, most electricity markets were organized as closed
</p>
<p>concession areas in which the regulator allowed retailing to be performed by a
</p>
<p>single utility only. In addition, these local and regional retailers were allowed to
</p>
<p>sign long-term and exclusive contracts with upstream power generators. According
</p>
<p>to these contracts, utilities had the exclusive right to deliver electricity to the retail
</p>
<p>company in the concession area. Directly supplying final electricity users was
</p>
<p>prohibited. As a result, all final users were obligated to purchase electricity from
</p>
<p>a single retailer, precluding competition between generators. In return, distributors
</p>
<p>were not allowed to refuse any customer seeking grid connection. In addition,
</p>
<p>electricity prices in excess of regulated tariffs were disallowed, while large indus-
</p>
<p>trial customers benefitted from special purchase agreements at prices below the
</p>
<p>regulated tariff.
</p>
<p>These state-guaranteed regional monopolies were quite instrumental in
</p>
<p>establishing a safe and reliable electricity infrastructure covering even remote
</p>
<p>areas. Investments could easily be financed provided the regulator approved
</p>
<p>2Economic viability of pump storages is highly dependent on geographical circumstances. Also, a
</p>
<p>lithium battery with a mass of 1 kg can currently store no more than 1 kWh of electricity.
3In a sense, electricity is still &ldquo;too cheap to meter&rdquo;. This may change if smart meters become
</p>
<p>available at lower cost.
</p>
<p>12.1 Features of Electricity Markets 273</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>sufficiently high tariffs. Yet without the pressure of competition, utilities often had
</p>
<p>no incentive to invest in an efficient way, resulting in high cost and hence high
</p>
<p>regulated prices. Economic theory predicts that competition between generators
</p>
<p>and market access of independent power producers significantly reduces cost of
</p>
<p>operating an electricity system. In the European Union, another important motiva-
</p>
<p>tion for promoting competition by liberalizing power markets was the intention of
</p>
<p>the European Commission to create a single power market across Europe.
</p>
<p>In addition, vertically integrated utilities are not necessarily natural monopolies.
</p>
<p>According to Christensen and Greene (1976), potentials for economies of scale had
</p>
<p>been exhausted in large vertically integrated utilities in the United States.
</p>
<p>Thompson and Wolf (1993) support this finding which suggests that only the
</p>
<p>transmission and distribution parts of the electricity value chain represent a natural
</p>
<p>monopoly, where competition would cause inefficiency (see Sect. 13.2.1). Liberal-
</p>
<p>ization efforts should therefore focus on the other parts of the value chain, in
</p>
<p>particular generation, trading, and marketing, while regulating grid access in a
</p>
<p>way that competition among generators (and retailers) becomes possible (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 13.2).
</p>
<p>These insights leave a choice between several (partly) liberalized market design
</p>
<p>options.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Single buyer market: All electricity must be offered to a single buyer (usually
</p>
<p>government-managed). According to Hunt (2002), long-term contracts are
</p>
<p>required because there are not enough buyers for achieving full competition.
</p>
<p>The single buyer calculates the minimum cost dispatch such that the aggregate
</p>
<p>load demanded is always met by the least expensive combination of available
</p>
<p>capacities. However, supply-side regulation is still necessary to prevent
</p>
<p>generators from manipulating their bids (see Sect. 12.2.6). Retailers and other
</p>
<p>affected customers have no alternatives other than to buy all electricity from the
</p>
<p>single buyer since bilateral contracts between generators and consumers are
</p>
<p>prohibited. This market design permits incumbent retailers to keep their monop-
</p>
<p>olistic market positions. Additionally, the single buyer may allocate side
</p>
<p>payments to stimulate investment in reserve capacity if deemed necessary.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Mandatory power pool: All generated electricity must be offered to a pool,
</p>
<p>which serves as an exchange for retailers and other affected customers, who
</p>
<p>are permitted to submit individual bids to satisfy their power needs. The pool
</p>
<p>operator calculates the market-clearing price, which is applicable for all buyers
</p>
<p>and sellers. Bids are based on load forecasts which may reflect demand-side
</p>
<p>management designed to reduce fluctuations and with them cost (see Sect.
</p>
<p>12.1.2). Again, manipulation of bids can occur, calling for price regulation.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Free wholesale competition: Power can be traded either through bilateral long-
</p>
<p>term contracts (forward and future contracts with physical settlement) or anony-
</p>
<p>mously through an exchange. This model offers more flexibility to sellers and
</p>
<p>buyers than a mandatory power pool. However, optional participation in the
</p>
<p>exchange may result in reduced liquidity and higher volatility of wholesale
</p>
<p>prices.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ndash; Fully liberalized market with retail competition: This is the most sophisticated
</p>
<p>design option because it gives also small customers the right to freely choose
</p>
<p>their supplier. They are no longer &lsquo;captive customers&rsquo; in the hands of their
</p>
<p>original contractual partner. Retail companies can enter the market without
</p>
<p>physical assets, allowing them to gain market share with innovative products.
</p>
<p>However, because load forecasting errors are unavoidable, an independent
</p>
<p>balancing mechanism needs to be in place. Each of the participating companies
</p>
<p>needs to have a contract with the system operator comprising the obligation to
</p>
<p>follow grid codes, report load schedules, and purchase balancing power in the
</p>
<p>event of deviations from the schedules. Yet experience shows that many small
</p>
<p>customers are reluctant to change supplier. Margins are usually small in the retail
</p>
<p>business because all retailers purchase electricity at more or less the same
</p>
<p>wholesale prices. Many authors (e.g. Stoft 2000, p. 26ff; Bhattacharyya 2011,
</p>
<p>p. 713ff) therefore argue against the benefits of retail competition. However, the
</p>
<p>European Electricity Market Directives 96/92/EC, 2003/54/EC, and in particular
</p>
<p>2009/72/EC mandate the implementation of this design in the European Union
</p>
<p>(see European Commission 2009a, b).
</p>
<p>12.2 Electricity Generation
</p>
<p>As a consequence of the virtual non-storability of electricity and the limited
</p>
<p>availability of load management measures, power generators need to continuously
</p>
<p>adjust their production in order to balance supply and demand. In this section, the
</p>
<p>basic generation technologies to accomplish such a task are presented. The discus-
</p>
<p>sion also addresses the economic implications of the fact that the portfolio of
</p>
<p>generation capacities is fixed, at least in the short run. A third topic is the balancing
</p>
<p>of supply and demand as currently accomplished in the European Union and how it
</p>
<p>differs from procedures employed in non-liberalized markets.
</p>
<p>12.2.1 Types of Power Generation Technologies
</p>
<p>Most power plants generate electricity according to the principle of magnetic
</p>
<p>induction. Their electric side consists of a stator (a coil) and a rotor (a rotating
</p>
<p>electromagnet). The generator produces alternating current (AC), with a specified
</p>
<p>frequency (50 Hz in Europe) and an electric voltage between 6 and 21 kV. For the
</p>
<p>propulsion of the generator, kinetic energy is supplied by turbines using thermal
</p>
<p>energy from combustion processes. Other types of power plants use hydropower
</p>
<p>and wind power as a source of kinetic energy. Still another approach is to use
</p>
<p>electrochemical processes such as those characterizing photovoltaic cells and fuel
</p>
<p>cells. These devices produce direct current (DC) that needs to pass through an
</p>
<p>inverter before being fed into public grids, which operate with AC. Table 12.1
</p>
<p>shows some key properties of several generating technologies.
</p>
<p>12.2 Electricity Generation 275</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ndash; Steam turbine power plants are based on a thermal cycle (see Sect. 2.2.2,
</p>
<p>particularly Fig. 2.1). The heat from burning fossil fuels is used to transform
</p>
<p>water into high-temperature and high-pressure steam. The steam is fed to a
</p>
<p>turbine, where it expands, generating rotational energy that drives the generator.
</p>
<p>The residual heat dissipates through a steam condenser into the environment. Up
</p>
<p>to 46% of the thermal energy contained in the fuel (which comprises fossil and
</p>
<p>nuclear energy sources) can be converted into electricity. Solar thermal and
</p>
<p>geothermal power plants work according to the same thermodynamic cycle.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Gas turbine power plants are based on the combustion of a gaseous fuel in the
</p>
<p>turbine. In the cold part of the turbine, a mix of gas and air is compressed and fed
</p>
<p>to the combustion chamber. There, the mix is ignited to produce high
</p>
<p>temperatures and pressures. In the hot part of the turbine, the mix expands,
</p>
<p>generating rotational energy that drives the generator. Depending on pressure
</p>
<p>and temperature, thermal efficiencies of up to 42% can be reached (also known
</p>
<p>as Carnot efficiency).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT) use both gas and steam technologies. The
</p>
<p>exhaust gas from a gas turbine is directed to a waste heat boiler where it is used
</p>
<p>to produce steam that in turn powers a turbine. In this way, combined-cycle
</p>
<p>power plants can reach fuel efficiencies of more than 60%.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Hydropower plants transform the kinetic energy from flowing water into rota-
</p>
<p>tional energy. Run-of-river plants use vertical drops amounting to only a few
</p>
<p>meters, storage power plants of up to several 100 m. While storage power plants

<p>only once, pump storage power plants are able to reuse the water several times to
</p>
<p>generate electricity. They collect the water in a lower basin and pump it back
</p>
<p>into an upper basin using cheap excess power. While run-of-river plants produce
</p>
<p>electricity more or less continuously, storage and pumped storage power plants
</p>
<p>are preferably used to cover peak demand.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Wind power plants use the kinetic power of wind to drive a generator. Like
</p>
<p>hydropower stations, they make do without fuel, resulting in low variable cost
</p>
<p>and no greenhouse gas emissions. However, their production crucially depends
</p>
<p>on wind speed. As shown in Fig. 12.2, wind speed is a random variable
</p>
<p>characterized by a high degree of skewness. In addition, wind turbines require
</p>
<p>wind speeds in excess of 3 m/s but below 14 m/s to be able to generate power,
</p>
<p>resulting in a characteristic performance line that levels off at 14 m/s. Moreover,
</p>
<p>its capacity factor is usually below 30% in the case of onshore plants, while
</p>
<p>offshore plants can even reach capacity factors of up to 50%. The capacity
</p>
<p>factors of wind power plants have an impact on their average generation cost (the
</p>
<p>higher the capacity factor, the lower average cost, see Sect. 3.1, particularly
</p>
<p>Table 3.1).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Photovoltaic power generation is based on electrochemical transformation of
</p>
<p>sunlight into a DC of electrons that is usually converted to AC. Like wind power,
</p>
<p>photovoltaics represent an environmentally friendly but intermittent way of
</p>
<p>power generation. Its capacity factor lies between 10% and 25%. Recently, the
</p>
<p>unit cost of the modules has strongly declined, leading to growing shares of
</p>
<p>photovoltaic capacity worldwide.

</p>
<p>membrane (PEM) separates anode and the cathode. At the cathode, oxygen
</p>
<p>reacts with protons and electrons to form water. With a process temperature
</p>
<p>below 100 �C (so-called cold combustion), a PEM fuel cell can be operated quite
</p>
<p>dynamically.
</p>
<p>Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE or average production cost, respectively)
</p>
<p>mainly depends on the cost of fuel as well as on the annualized investment outlay in
</p>
<p>combination with the rate of capacity utilization. A power plant with a rated
</p>
<p>capacity of 1 MWel could theoretically generate 24�365&frac14; 8760 MWh of electricity
per year. However, for maintenance work already, no generator is able to operate at
</p>
<p>full load during all 8760 h of a year. Furthermore, there are economic reasons why
</p>
<p>power plants might operate at low capacity factors (defined as the ratio of actual
</p>
<p>output over potential output in a year). Figure 12.3 compares levelized cost of two
</p>
<p>selected generation technologies, natural gas and hard coal, as a function of the
</p>
<p>number of full load hours. Due to their relatively high investment outlay per unit of
</p>
<p>installed capacity, levelized cost of hard coal-fired plants is higher than that of
</p>
<p>gas-fired plants at low rates of capacity utilization. However, beyond 3000 h of
</p>
<p>operation, its relatively low fuel cost (see Table 12.1) begins to drive levelized cost
</p>
<p>below that of a gas-fired plant. Accordingly, coal-fired power plants usually are
</p>
<p>more efficient for covering base load demand (&gt;5000 full-load hours p.a.), while
</p>
<p>gas-fired ones are generally used to cover peak load demand.

<p>revenue equals the market price. Depending on the type of plant, marginal cost
</p>
<p>comprises the following components:
</p>
<p>&ndash; The fuel cost incurred to generate an additional unit of electricity depends on
</p>
<p>fuel prices and (inversely) on fuel efficiency. Thus, modern, highly efficient
</p>
<p>power stations usually have lower marginal cost compared to older, less efficient
</p>
<p>facilities. Furthermore, all power plants are characterized by technical
</p>
<p>conditions (such as degree of utilization and temperature) for maximum energy
</p>
<p>efficiency. Deviations from these conditions cause efficiency losses and hence
</p>
<p>higher fuel consumption. This also includes additional fuel consumption caused
</p>
<p>by shut-on and shut-off processes as thermal power stations need to be heated up
</p>
<p>before being able to generate electricity.
</p>
<p>&ndash; In the European Union, fossil fuels used for power generation are subject to
</p>
<p>CO2emission allowances. Therefore, the marginal cost of electricity generation
</p>
<p>also depends on the quantity of carbon dioxide emitted by the power station to
</p>
<p>produce one unit of electricity as well as on the CO2 market price (see
</p>
<p>Table 10.5).
</p>
<p>As discussed in Sect. 12.1.3, one needs to have functioning markets in order to
</p>
<p>introduce competition at the level of generation. In the European Union, the most
</p>
<p>important one is the spot market which is equivalent to the day-ahead market.4
</p>
<p>Products traded on this market are deliveries of power for specific hours of the
</p>
<p>following day as well as blocks of these contracts. The European Power Exchange
</p>
<p>(EPEX) constitutes the most liquid day-ahead market in Europe. It is of the uniform
</p>
<p>price auction type in that all bids and asks for a given hour are collected and
</p>
<p>aggregated to form an hourly supply and an hourly demand curve. At the close of
</p>
<p>trading, the exchange calculates the hourly market-clearing price (MCP), which is
</p>
<p>determined by the intersection of the two curves. Market participants are informed
</p>
<p>whether their bids and asks are accepted or not. All accepted bids and asks receive
</p>
<p>(pay, respectively) the same MCP.
</p>
<p>Assuming perfect competition, the optimal strategy of each supplier is to ask the
</p>
<p>(short-term) marginal cost of the power plant. This causes the aggregate supply
</p>
<p>curve to reflect the so-called merit order as shown in Fig. 12.4. During off-peak
</p>
<p>hours (typically during night and weekend hours), the hourly price poff-peak is low,
</p>
<p>covering only the marginal cost of power plants with low marginal cost such as
</p>
<p>lignite and hard coal power plants. Therefore, it is these plants that will be
</p>
<p>dispatched, while the higher-cost plants remain offline. During peak hours (defining
</p>
<p>peak demand), the price ppeak is sufficiently high to cover the marginal cost of
</p>
<p>higher-cost production units such as oil-fueled and gas-fueled power plants.
</p>
<p>Depending on market design, generators may be allowed to sign long-term
</p>
<p>contracts with retailers, causing them to offer only part of their generation capacity
</p>
<p>on the spot market. This is the case for many European countries, e.g. Germany. For
</p>
<p>4In the United States, the day-ahead market is not regarded as a spot but rather a futures market.
</p>

<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_10">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_10</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>this reason, only 30&ndash;50% of total power generated in Germany is sold on the spot
</p>
<p>market. Furthermore, participation of foreign suppliers and customers is limited due
</p>
<p>to constraints concerning available interconnector capacities.
</p>
<p>As shown in Table 12.1, generators using renewable energy sources have rather
</p>
<p>low marginal cost (with the exception of biogas). If these generators were to offer
</p>
<p>their capacities under competitive conditions making them sell their power at
</p>
<p>marginal cost, hydropower, wind, and photovoltaic would be prioritized in the
</p>
<p>merit order dispatch. Their increasing production thus shifts the position of the
</p>
<p>other power generators with higher marginal costs in the merit order to the right. As
</p>
<p>long as demand remains unaffected, this causes the market-clearing price to fall, an
</p>
<p>effect known as the &lsquo;merit order effect of renewables&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>12.2.3 Properties of Day-Ahead Power Prices
</p>
<p>Hourly day-ahead power prices are relatively volatile due to low price elasticities of
</p>
<p>the demand and supply function in a number of situations. This volatility is also
</p>
<p>reflected in daily averages of hourly prices which are at the focus of the following
</p>
<p>analysis. For reasons that will become clear below, daily average prices are studied
</p>
<p>separately for peak and off-peak periods.5
</p>
<p>Part of the day-ahead price fluctuations can be explained by calendar effects and
</p>
<p>is therefore predictable. For risk management, only the non-predictable part of price
</p>
<p>fluctuations is relevant. The following regression equation relates (the natural
</p>
<p>logarithm) of average daily peak and off-peak prices to predictable and
</p>

<p>8:00 and 20:00 from Monday to Friday, while the remaining times are off-peak hours.

<p>&lsquo;0&rsquo; if the observation does not fall in the pertinent category or the value &lsquo;1&rsquo; if it
</p>
<p>does. Variable no. 7, ln( pF,t-1), represents (the natural logarithm of) the peak price
</p>
<p>(the off-peak price, respectively) of the derivative traded on the previous day. Its
</p>
<p>coefficient incorporates the effects of fuel prices, prices of CO2 allowances, and
</p>
<p>other influences impinging on the average day-ahead price. The unpredictable
</p>
<p>component is accounted for by ut, the error term of the ordinary least-squares
</p>
<p>(OLS) estimation.

</p>
<p>Depending on the price elasticities of demand and supply, small variations in
</p>
<p>power demand and supply may lead to major price fluctuations during peak periods
</p>
<p>while having little impact during off-peak periods (see the example of Fig. 12.4). In
</p>
<p>the past, this difference could be observed regularly, as indicated by the histograms
</p>
<p>of day-ahead prices between 2003 and 2005 in Fig. 12.5: While the frequency
</p>
<p>distribution of peak prices is skewed to the left (indicating price spikes), that of
</p>
<p>off-peak prices is roughly symmetric.
</p>
<p>However, at that time, market shares of volatile wind power and photovoltaic
</p>
<p>were still small. In the meantime, their share exceeds 20% in several countries and
</p>
<p>may occasionally rise to over 50%, depending on weather and power demand
</p>
<p>conditions. As noted above, the merit order effect of renewables shifts the aggregate
</p>
<p>supply curve (see Fig. 12.4) away from the origin to the right. In addition, the
</p>
<p>relevant section of the merit order curve becomes more price-elastic, which serves
</p>
<p>to reduce the frequency of upward price spikes. Finally, renewables in combination
</p>
<p>with so-called must-run capacities6 may even generate more electricity than
</p>
<p>demanded at the given price. During these periods, price turns negative, implying
</p>
<p>that plant operators have to pay money in order to get rid of their power. This
</p>
<p>negative price reflects the so-called cycle-cost (for the shut-off and shut-on process)
</p>
<p>of the plant.
</p>
<p>Another important property of day-ahead power prices is their so-called mean
</p>
<p>reversion. This property states that deviations between the actual spot market price
</p>
<p>pt. and the steady-state price pL tend to be eliminated over time.
7 This can be
</p>
<p>formalized as
</p>
<p>6Must-run capacities are generators with contracts for so-called control power (see Sect. 13.1.3)
</p>
<p>and combined heat and power plants during the heating period.
7Accordingly, the residuals of Eq. (12.2) are highly auto-correlated.

<p>If the (adjusted) spot market price pt. is larger than the equilibrium price pL,t, the
</p>
<p>logarithm on the right-hand side becomes negative, leading to a price reduction in
</p>
<p>the time interval dt according to the reversion rate 0 &lt; κ &lt; 1. Obviously, the
</p>
<p>converse holds if the spot market price is below the equilibrium price. Estimates of
</p>
<p>κ suggest that mean reversion does not take more than two weeks in the day-ahead
</p>
<p>power market. The second term in Eq. (12.4) captures the impact of stochastic
</p>
<p>fluctuations. While textbook economics assumes dz. to be normally distributed
</p>
<p>(so-called random Brownian motion), the histograms of Fig. 12.5 indicate this not
</p>
<p>to be true.
</p>
<p>12.2.4 Intraday Markets
</p>
<p>Because electricity cannot be stored, all market participants must close their open
</p>
<p>positions (typically every quarter of an hour) with reference to a specific execution
</p>
<p>period. A position is open if actual demand or supply differs from the contracted
</p>
<p>(or forecast) quantities. These forecasts depend on many parameters and must
</p>
<p>regularly be revised whenever new information becomes available. In particular,
</p>
<p>such a revision becomes necessary when retailers attract or lose new customers.
</p>
<p>An important cause of forecasting errors is intermittent electricity generation
</p>
<p>from wind power and photovoltaics. Even the most sophisticated day-ahead
</p>
<p>forecasts of aggregate supply regularly exhibit errors. In view of the large installed
</p>
<p>capacities of these plants, these errors can exceed several thousand MW.8However,

<p>hour-ahead forecasts are much more accurate compared to day-ahead forecasts.
</p>
<p>Therefore, intraday markets that allow trades until one hour before execution are
</p>
<p>well suited to close gaps between day-ahead and intraday forecasts. There are two
</p>
<p>types of intraday markets:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Pool-type intraday markets re-use the schedules and bids that have been submit-
</p>
<p>ted for day-ahead scheduling. Close to real-time delivery, the optimal dispatch of
</p>
<p>power plants is recalculated.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Intraday markets can also consist of bilateral trades on energy exchanges without
</p>
<p>being institutionally linked to a day-ahead market. This is the model used in
</p>
<p>most European countries.
</p>
<p>However, bilateral intraday markets usually have limited liquidity, particularly
</p>
<p>if characterized by continuous trading. Nevertheless, observed intraday price vola-
</p>
<p>tility does not appear excessive compared to day-ahead price volatility. The reason
</p>
<p>is arbitrage transactions by some operators of conventional power plants. On the
</p>
<p>one hand, when more renewable energy is offered than predicted by the day-ahead
</p>
<p>forecast, they may reduce their own generation, substituting it with electricity from
</p>
<p>renewables purchased on the intraday market. Of course, they only do this if their
</p>
<p>own cost saving exceeds the current price of electricity on the intraday market. On
</p>
<p>the other hand, when supply from renewables falls short of prediction, these
</p>
<p>operators step up their generation if possible. In both cases, the marginal cost of
</p>
<p>the respective conventional plant determines the intraday market price provided the
</p>
<p>market is efficient. Gaps between supply and demand that remain after close of
</p>
<p>trading on the intraday market must be balanced by the responsible system operator
</p>
<p>during the delivery period (see Sect. 13.1). Eventually, intraday prices converge to
</p>
<p>expected prices for balancing power prices (real-time prices).
</p>
<p>12.2.5 Portfolio Management
</p>
<p>A distinction can be made between companies that initially have long positions (net
</p>
<p>suppliers) and companies that initially have short positions (net demanders). Power
</p>
<p>generators without final customers belong to the first group, while retailers without
</p>
<p>their own generation capacities belong to the second. Both groups are exposed to a
</p>
<p>substantial risk of price volatility on the day-ahead markets (see Sect. 12.2.3).They
</p>
<p>can hedge this risk by concluding long-term contracts where prices are usually
</p>
<p>agreed upon contract conclusion and settlement occurs in the future, at time of
</p>
<p>delivery.
</p>
<p>There exist two basic types of such derivatives: forwards and futures. Forwards
</p>
<p>(also called over-the-counter contracts) are bilateral contracts tailored to the needs
</p>
<p>of the two parties. However, with the establishment of liquid day-ahead markets

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and informative spot market prices, futures can be established as an alternative to
</p>
<p>forwards. Futures are standardized contracts traded and cleared through exchanges
</p>
<p>(see also Sect. 8.3.3). The most important power future is the year-ahead base
</p>
<p>contract, which is defined by 1 MW of electricity to be delivered in each of the
</p>
<p>8760 h of the coming year. Similarly the year-ahead peak contract is defined for all
</p>
<p>peak hours of the following year. Settlement can occur either physically or finan-
</p>
<p>cially. In the case of physical settlement, the seller delivers the contracted amount
</p>
<p>of electricity to the exchange at the specified time. In the case of financial settle-
</p>
<p>ment, there is no physical delivery. Moreover, a payment is made amounting to the
</p>
<p>difference between the hourly day-ahead price and the agreed future price
</p>
<p>(so-called contract for differences). This allows financial speculators from outside
</p>
<p>the electricity industry to participate in risk hedging.
</p>
<p>Portfolio management refers to the optimal combination of different contracts.
</p>
<p>Risk-averse generators and retailers have to decide whether to use long-term
</p>
<p>contracts (forwards and futures) to close positions or to trade on the spot market
</p>
<p>instead. However, prices of long-term contracts often differ from expected spot
</p>
<p>market prices. The difference between the current forward price pF,t (T ) for delivery
</p>
<p>in period T and the expected spot price Et[pT] of this period,
</p>
<p>FPt T&eth; &THORN; &frac14; pF, t T&eth; &THORN; � Et pT&frac12; �: &eth;12:5&THORN;
</p>
<p>is referred to as the forward premium. The forward premium can be positive or
</p>
<p>negative. In the case where the forward price is higher than the expected spot price,
</p>
<p>the market is said to be in contango; otherwise, it is in backwardation. A contango
</p>
<p>situation implies that retailers are more risk-averse than generators and therefore
</p>
<p>pay the forward premium to generators. Under backwardation the opposite is
</p>
<p>the case.
</p>
<p>According to JohnMaynard Keynes, backwardation should be the dominant case
</p>
<p>in speculative markets because producers, being less diversified in terms of their
</p>
<p>assets, are usually more interested in hedging price risks than customers (see Hicks
</p>
<p>1939, 135&ndash;140). Besembinder and Lemmon (2002) developed this idea further. In
</p>
<p>their model all market participants are risk-averse and buy forward contracts in
</p>
<p>order to maximize the linear combination of expected profit and associated variance
</p>
<p>(so-called Bernoulli criterion, see Sect. 3.5). In electricity wholesale markets,
</p>
<p>participants are exposed to cost risks and revenue risks. Since the revenue risks
</p>
<p>of producers equal the cost risks of retailers, this risk is netted out at the market
</p>
<p>level. Consequently, the forward premium depends only on
</p>
<p>&ndash; the revenue risk of the retailers,
</p>
<p>&ndash; the cost risk of electricity generators.
</p>
<p>According to the authors, the forward premium is therefore given by

</p>
<p>Among other things, this equation implies that peak load forward premiums
</p>
<p>should be larger than off-peak forward premiums because the skewness of peak
</p>
<p>prices exceeds that of off-peak prices (see Fig. 12.5). However, empirically testing
</p>
<p>it is challenging because the forward premium depends on the expected spot market
</p>
<p>price, which cannot be directly observed using market data.
</p>
<p>With power market liberalization and the introduction of free wholesale markets
</p>
<p>and retail competition, efficient portfolio management has become an important
</p>
<p>asset for market participants. In the case of Germany, retailers and eligible final
</p>
<p>customers secure 80&ndash;90% of their power needs either through their own generation
</p>
<p>or through forwards and futures. This leaves less than 20% of demand to be covered
</p>
<p>by transactions on the spot market. However, during times when supply from
</p>
<p>renewables is high, purchases by conventional generators are needed to achieve
</p>
<p>balance. If the spot price falls to a level below the short term marginal generation
</p>
<p>cost (STMGC), it is efficient for generators to become buyers rather than sellers of
</p>
<p>electricity.
</p>
<p>12.2.6 Market Power
</p>
<p>Up to this point, the analysis of power prices proceeded on the assumption of
</p>
<p>perfect competition among power plant operators, implying that no single generator
</p>
<p>is able to drive the wholesale price above the competitive level (Mas-Colell et al.
</p>
<p>1995). Perfect competition thus requires a rather large number of independent
</p>
<p>generators, but in reality a relatively small number of power companies dominates
</p>
<p>the market, providing them with leeway to fix prices above marginal cost.
</p>
<p>There is a manifold of models designed to explain the supply behavior in
</p>
<p>oligopolistic markets. Some models assume simultaneous decisions, others,
</p>
<p>sequential decisions by competitors. Since day-ahead prices result from single
</p>
<p>uniform auctions, assuming sequential decision-making does not seem to be appro-
</p>
<p>priate here. A more relevant distinction is whether the strategic variable of
</p>
<p>generators is quantity or price. The first case is called Cournot competition, the
</p>
<p>second, Bertrand competition.
</p>
<p>Focusing on Cournot competition, one finds that the analysis becomes rather
</p>
<p>complex unless simplifying assumptions are made. One assumption is that a
</p>
<p>predetermined number of n generators have the same cost function with identical
</p>
<p>fixed cost Cfix and constant marginal cost cmc, where Qi is the quantity of electricity
</p>
<p>produced by generator i.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This assumption implies that all generators use the same technology in each
</p>
<p>market segment (i.e. peak, off-peak). As a consequence, the optimal rate of produc-
</p>
<p>tion is the same across generators.9
</p>
<p>In addition, a linear inverse demand function is assumed, with the market price

<p>Therefore, each oligopolist takes the competitive market volume as the point of

<p>departure and deducts the (optimal) quantities supplied by everyone. However,
</p>
<p>given the common cost function (12.7), the optimal generation of all n companies is

</p>
<p>As expected, the oligopolistic equilibrium price exceeds the competitive one, given
</p>
<p>by marginal cost cmc. The markup decreases with the number of generators.
10 This
</p>
<p>shows that incumbent generators have an incentive to prevent market entry by
</p>
<p>newcomers. If permitted by antitrust law, they may also try to reduce the number of
</p>
<p>competitors, e.g. through horizontal mergers.
</p>
<p>According to Eq. (12.14), the price markup over marginal cost cmc depends on
</p>
<p>the slope b1 &gt; 0 of the inverse demand function (12.8). It decreases with the own
</p>
<p>price elasticity of electricity demand. Therefore, elastic demand is an effective
</p>
<p>instrument against market power of generators.
</p>
<p>In order to obtain a more realistic depiction of market power in the case of
</p>
<p>electricity, the assumption of constant marginal cost has to be dropped. In Sect.
</p>
<p>12.2.2 (see Fig. 12.4) it is shown that the merit order of power generation is
</p>
<p>basically a non-linear and convex function, which can be approximated by
</p>
<p>cmc &frac14; a0 &thorn; a1Q
a2 with a0 &gt; 0, a1 &gt; 0 and a2 &gt; 1: &eth;12:15&THORN;
</p>
<p>If marginal cost increases exponentially with the rate of production Q as
</p>
<p>assumed here, the withdrawal of a generating unit from the day-ahead market
</p>
<p>leads to a relatively high increase in prices. On the one hand, capacity withholding
</p>
<p>eliminates the contribution margin of the plant that is not operating. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, the operator receives higher contribution margins from its remaining plants.
</p>
<p>In general, the additional contribution margins overcompensate the losses if the
</p>
<p>price effect and the remaining capacities of the operator are sufficiently high. This
</p>
<p>effect is usually stronger during peak than off-peak hours. The key point is that
</p>
<p>withholding strategies can be attractive even for generators with only moderate
</p>
<p>market shares. Therefore, competition authorities see a need to supervise spot
</p>
<p>markets for electricity.
</p>
<p>However, it can be argued that wholesale power prices would be at competitive
</p>
<p>levels even though the generation industry is concentrated and in the absence of
</p>
<p>regulation.
</p>
<p>&ndash; A first argument is theoretical by nature. Should generators use price instead of
</p>
<p>quantity as strategic variable, the market is said to be in Bertrand competition.
</p>
<p>Assuming equal cost functions for all generators, this gives rise to the so-called
</p>
<p>Bertrand paradox. If an oligopolist asks a price above its marginal cost, it risks

solution corresponds to the profit-maximizing solution derived in Sect. 1.2.2.

<p>losing the market if competitors ask marginal cost prices. Therefore, no price
</p>
<p>markup is expected under Bertrand competition.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The other arguments are empirical by nature. With an increasing market share of
</p>
<p>renewables, the merit order flattens (a2 in Eq. (12.15) becomes close to one).
</p>
<p>This reduces the profit potential of withholding capacity.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Under free wholesale competition, generators are not only on the supply side but
</p>
<p>also on the demand side of the market (see Sect. 12.2.5). In fact, generators on
</p>
<p>the demand side do not benefit from price markups. Indeed, they would rather
</p>
<p>prefer low prices. As a consequence, regulation of day-ahead prices in free
</p>
<p>markets is less urgent than in pool-type markets which constrain generators to
</p>
<p>be suppliers only.
</p>
<p>&ndash; As will be shown in Sect. 12.3.2, a price equal to marginal cost may be
</p>
<p>insufficient for calling forth investment in generation capacities. Therefore, strict
</p>
<p>(marginal) price regulation of the day-ahead market may cause a need to
</p>
<p>implement an additional mechanism for creating revenue that makes investing
</p>
<p>in power capacities attractive, thus securing future electricity supply.
</p>
<p>12.3 Power Plant Investments
</p>
<p>12.3.1 Power Plant Investments in Regulated Markets
</p>
<p>Before market liberalization, power generation and retail were organized in closed
</p>
<p>concession areas without competition. The concession usually entailed three
</p>
<p>obligations:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Potential customers must be connected to the grid provided this is economically
</p>
<p>viable;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Customers must be supplied at a politically regulated tariff;
</p>
<p>&ndash; The concessionary must pay a fee to the jurisdiction where it operates the grid.
</p>
<p>Under these conditions, investment planning is straightforward. First, the
</p>
<p>monopolistic utility forecasts the so-called ordered load duration curve for each
</p>
<p>year of the planning period by ordering the 24 � 365 &frac14; 8760 h according to the
expected load (see Fig. 12.6).11 The load duration curve is not predetermined but
</p>
<p>can be modified by measures of demand-side management, such as peak shaving
</p>
<p>and load shifting.
</p>
<p>The second step of the monopolistic planning process is to match predicted
</p>
<p>demand with existing supply. In order to do so, the area below the duration curve is
</p>
<p>filled by rectangles representing each available power plant whose height indicates
</p>
<p>the rated load and whose width corresponds to the expected load factor. Power
</p>
<p>11Note that this is nothing but a frequency distribution with frequencies depicted on the x-axis
</p>
<p>rather than the y-axis.
</p>
<p>288 12 Markets for Electricity</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>plants designed for an operation with less than 3000 h per year are peak load units
</p>
<p>while plants designed for more than 6000 annual operating hours are base load units
</p>
<p>(depending on their cost structures, see also Sect. 12.2.1, in particular Fig. 12.3).
</p>
<p>This planning step also takes into account power plants that will be retired during
</p>
<p>the planning period.
</p>
<p>Finally, the need for investing in new power plants is signaled by failure of the
</p>
<p>area below the ordered load curve to be entirely covered by the existing power
</p>
<p>plants, including a predetermined reserve margin. To finance the required
</p>
<p>investments, the regulator may allow a tariff surcharge. In principle, this could
</p>
<p>result in less rather than more revenue, depending on the own price elasticity of
</p>
<p>demand. However, this elasticity is usually relatively low in absolute value in the
</p>
<p>case of electricity, implying that the quantity demanded falls by a small
</p>
<p>amount only.
</p>
<p>Evidently, regulators need to know how high investment in capacity and the
</p>
<p>associated surcharge should optimally be. The pertinent theory was developed by
</p>
<p>economists, notably Boiteux (1956), Steiner (1957), and Kahn (1970). Its starting
</p>
<p>point is the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for electricity, with WTP for
</p>
<p>off-peak power distinguished from WTP for peak power. In Fig. 12.7 both
</p>
<p>schedules of marginal WTP for off-peak power are falling with quantity, reflecting
</p>
<p>two demand functions. For simplicity, current production and capacity are depicted
</p>
<p>on the same x-axis. By deducting marginal cost of current production, one obtains
</p>
<p>marginal WTP specifically for capacity, one for the off-peak and another for the
</p>
<p>peak segment. They are nonlinear because marginal cost of current production is
</p>
<p>assumed to be increasing. Note that marginal WTP for capacity is zero at Q0,off-peak
for consumers in the off-peak segment and at Q0,peak for consumers in the peak load
</p>
<p>segment. Assuming non-rivalry in consumption across the two segments, one can
</p>
<p>combine the two marginal WTP schedules vertically to form a total marginal WTP
</p>
<p>schedule as a function of quantity and hence capacity Q. Aggregation is vertical
</p>
<p>rather than horizontal (as in the case of a private good) because a given capacity is
</p>
<p>at the disposal of peak as well as off-peak consumers, thus amounting to a public

<p>good. After vertical aggregation, one obtains total marginal WTP for capacity,
</p>
<p>which coincides with the peak load segment between Q0,peak and Q0,off-peak. Below
</p>
<p>Q0,off-peak, marginal WTP of off-peak consumers kicks in.
</p>
<p>Optimal capacity is indicated by Q*, where total marginal WTP for capacity
</p>
<p>equals its marginal cost (which is assumed to be constant for simplicity). If existing
</p>
<p>capacity is below this optimum, Q* indicates the efficient amount of investment. In
</p>
<p>the case depicted in Fig. 12.7, only consumers in the peak load segment optimally
</p>
<p>pay for the extra capacity because marginal WTP of off-peak consumers does not
</p>
<p>enter the determination of Q*. However, if the marginal cost of capacity were
</p>
<p>(much) higher, the optimum would shift to a point below Q0,off-peak. There, the two
</p>
<p>consumer groups would have to contribute to the cost of capacity expansion
</p>
<p>according to their marginal WTP. Needless to say, estimating marginal WTP is
</p>
<p>difficult for the regulator since consumers have an incentive to understate
</p>
<p>it. Finally, note that the total price paid for electricity exceeds the marginal cost
</p>
<p>of its current production. Consumers are made to also cover the cost of capacity
</p>
<p>expansion, which is to be regarded as a fixed cost once the investment has been
</p>
<p>made. This constitutes a deviation from the rule &ldquo;price equals marginal cost&rdquo; which
</p>
<p>causes a welfare loss. The regulator may seek to minimize this welfare loss by
</p>
<p>applying so-called Ramsey pricing, to be discussed in Sect. 13.2.2.
</p>
<p>One of the aims of electricity market liberalization is to permit effective compe-
</p>
<p>tition in the generation segment of the electricity value chain. Once competition is
</p>
<p>established, the market determines optimal generation prices, as explained in Sect.
</p>
<p>12.2.2. Thus the regulator should restrain from imposing prices (including Ramsey
</p>
<p>pricing) on the generation industry. However, regardless of how electricity

<p>competition is organized, the grid will always constitute a natural monopoly and
</p>
<p>therefore needs to be regulated. Therefore, even though the theory of optimal
</p>
<p>regulation and Ramsey pricing is not relevant for the liberalized generation seg-
</p>
<p>ment, they will remain relevant for the grid segment of the electricity value chain
</p>
<p>(for further discussion, see Chap. 13).
</p>
<p>12.3.2 Power Plant Investment in Competitive Markets
</p>
<p>Sufficient generation capacities are a key condition for a safe and reliable electricity
</p>
<p>supply. Yet the discussion in Sect. 12.2.6 shows that by withholding capacity,
</p>
<p>generators can drive up wholesale prices. This opportunity militates against
</p>
<p>investing in additional capacity even though it may be indispensable for supply
</p>
<p>security in future. Independent power producers&mdash;if admitted as newcomers&mdash;may
</p>
<p>close the gap provided economic opportunities exist. In this case, incumbents risk
</p>
<p>loss of market share if they abstain from investing in an attempt to limit generation
</p>
<p>capacities. Therefore, no systematical underinvestment is to be expected if genera-
</p>
<p>tion markets are both competitive and open.
</p>
<p>The economic theory of investment laid out in Sect. 3.5 can also be applied to
</p>
<p>power plants. Investment in a new generation unit can be assessed by comparing
</p>
<p>expected cash flows or contribution margins and capital expenditures. Figure 12.8
</p>
<p>shows the (expected) ordered price duration curve consisting of the 8760 hourly
</p>
<p>day-ahead prices ph in a particular year of the planning period. The power plant will
</p>
<p>be running as long as this helps to recover user cost of capital, i.e. as long as its
</p>
<p>marginal cost (variable unit cost cvar, respectively) is below the sales price ph. The

<p>equality of the two determines the expected number of operation hours hexp in that

</p>
<p>Clearly price spikes contribute to cash flow, making investment in capacity
</p>
<p>attractive. Therefore, by suppressing price spikes the regulator weakens incentives
</p>
<p>to invest in new generation capacities.
</p>
<p>Since day-ahead power prices vary from year to year, the calculation according
</p>
<p>to Eq. (12.16) must be repeated annually, using the respective hourly price
</p>
<p>forecasts. To reflect the riskiness of day-ahead prices, their frequency distribution
</p>
<p>should be estimated as well, possibly by means of Monte Carlo simulation.
</p>
<p>In view of this distribution, investors can decide whether they want to hedge the
</p>
<p>price and cost risks by selling power and purchasing fuel and emission allowances
</p>
<p>using long-term contracts. If forward and futures markets for electricity, natural
</p>
<p>gas, coal, and emission rights are sufficiently liquid, power plant investments can be
</p>
<p>assessed using parameters gleaned from these markets:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Spark spread for gas plants &frac14; pF,electr � (1/ωgas) pF,gas. This is the difference
between the peak load electricity future and the gas future corrected by the fuel
</p>
<p>efficiency of the gas plant ωgas.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Clean spark spread for gas plants. This is derived from the spark spread by
</p>
<p>subtracting the cost of CO2 allowances for gas-fueled power generation (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 10.3).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Dark spread for coal plants &frac14; pF,electr � (1/ωcoal) pF,coal. The dark spread is the
difference between the base load electricity future and the coal future corrected
</p>
<p>by the fuel efficiency of the coal power plant ωcoal.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Clean dark spread for coal plants. This is derived from the dark spread by
</p>
<p>subtracting the cost of CO2 emission rights for coal-fueled power generation
</p>
<p>(see Sect. 10.3).
</p>
<p>In the absence of liquid forward and futures markets, these spreads need to be
</p>
<p>estimated using forecasting methods. Once investors have estimates of the clean
</p>
<p>spreads, they can assess the viability of a new power plant by comparing the spreads
</p>
<p>with the annual user cost of capital.
</p>
<p>An extension to this approach is based on real options theory (see Sect. 3.6). For
</p>
<p>instance, a gas power plant can also be interpreted as a call option on electricity
</p>
<p>with a strike price equal to the marginal cost of production. Once a new unit is
</p>
<p>available, the plant operator exercises this option whenever the clean spark spread
</p>
<p>is positive, producing as much electricity as possible. The interpretation of power
</p>
<p>plants as real options implies that their value exceeds the value of the underlying

<p>(i.e. the net present value of cash flows) by an option premium. This option
</p>
<p>premium increases with the volatility of cash flows and hence expected volatility
</p>
<p>of hourly spot prices (see Sect. 3.6). This again highlights the importance of spot
</p>
<p>market price spikes for investment in power plant under competition.
</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that a period of low investment in generating capacity
</p>
<p>leads to tight electricity supply, and thus higher spot and futures prices in both the
</p>
<p>base load and the peak load segment. If sufficiently large, the price increase creates
</p>
<p>an investment signal which ends the period of insufficient investment. However,
</p>
<p>one problem remains. Only if the time lag between the decision to invest and
</p>
<p>completion of the investment is sufficiently short does the market mechanism
</p>
<p>guarantee a stable long-term power supply.12 Otherwise, long-term price
</p>
<p>fluctuations combined with swings in supply may result.
</p>
<p>12.3.3 Capacity Markets
</p>
<p>The discussion of the preceding section raises the question of whether a liberalized
</p>
<p>electricity market is able to continuously secure power supply by calling forth
</p>
<p>sufficient investment in generating capacity. As electricity cannot be stored at
</p>
<p>reasonable cost given the present state of technology, safe and reliable power
</p>
<p>supply requires both excess and reserve capacity. Excess capacity is needed to
</p>
<p>cover unexpected surges in demand, while reserve capacities are required to make
</p>
<p>up for scheduled and unscheduled power plant outages. Some additional capacity is
</p>
<p>required for supplying so-called regulation power and other grid services, in
</p>
<p>particular so-called redispatch of generation in case of grid bottlenecks (see Sect.
</p>
<p>13.1). Overall, reserve margins of about 10% of maximum load are usually assumed
</p>
<p>to be necessary to secure electricity supply at any time (known as system
</p>
<p>adequacy).
</p>
<p>Arguably, system adequacy has a public good characteristic in the absence of
</p>
<p>smart grids because a single generator who contributes to it cannot easily prevent
</p>
<p>others who do not pay from reaping its benefits. In a monopolistic market with
</p>
<p>exclusive concession areas, the regulator requires the utility to secure system
</p>
<p>adequacy and allows a surcharge of tariffs to finance it. However, a competitive
</p>
<p>power market may fail to provide a sufficient reserve margin, calling for a separate
</p>
<p>mechanism for financing it. Several such mechanisms have been developed:
</p>
<p>12At the beginning of market liberalization, long-term power contracts were seen as an obstacle for
</p>
<p>competition. In contradistinction with the United States, European markets at the time were
</p>
<p>characterized by excess capacities which prevented planning for new investment from being an
</p>
<p>issue. Once these excess capacities in Europe are gone, long-term contracts could prove to be an
</p>
<p>indispensable tool for relieving investors of part of their risk, inducing them to add generating
</p>
<p>capacity. An alternative would be governmental guarantees, subsidies, and other types of market
</p>
<p>intervention.

<p>&ndash; The system operator (independent system operator [ISO] or regulated transmis-
</p>
<p>sion system operator [TSO]) purchases capacities that are needed for supplying
</p>
<p>balancing power. Plant operators receive capacity payments determined by pay-
</p>
<p>as-bid auctions (see Sect. 13.1.3).
</p>
<p>&ndash; In a fully liberalized market with retail competition, (potential) demand-side
</p>
<p>participants (often represented by so-called balancing group managers) have to
</p>
<p>purchase balancing power from the system operator in charge. If the imbalances
</p>
<p>are large, the regulator may fine participants (the balancing group manager,
</p>
<p>respectively). In extreme situations the system operator can prohibit them to use
</p>
<p>the grid (see also Sect. 3.6.1).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Special over-the-counter capacity markets are created, designed to provide back-
</p>
<p>up power in case of plant outages. Demand importantly originates with operators
</p>
<p>of small cogeneration plants.
</p>
<p>&ndash; In some countries, the regulator purchases (or mandates the system operator to
</p>
<p>purchase) emergency capacities that are released if the system threatens to
</p>
<p>collapse. The regulator has to decide the amount of capacity to be purchased,
</p>
<p>possibly through a public auction where bidders commit to supplying it in all
</p>
<p>circumstances. Since emergency capacities cannot be offered on the regular
</p>
<p>day-ahead market, this mechanism causes an increase in regular wholesale
</p>
<p>power prices. Conversely, when emergency capacities are in use, peak prices
</p>
<p>are under pressure. Obviously, the regulator needs a criterion for releasing
</p>
<p>emergency capacities, and this criterion determines the maximum hourly peak
</p>
<p>load price. Once again, public intervention therefore reduces price spikes
</p>
<p>(i.e. the slope of the price duration curve), undermining incentives to invest
</p>
<p>especially in peak power plants.
</p>
<p>The importance of price spikes for the capacity market can be illustrated using
</p>

<p>A corresponds to a regular market situation in which the marginal cost of the last
</p>
<p>plant that is available (i.e. excluding the reserve margin) determines the market-
</p>
<p>clearing price p1. Plants with lower marginal cost (to the left) also receive the price
</p>
<p>p1, earning a so-called inframarginal rent. The last unit in the merit order has
</p>
<p>marginal cost equal to p2. However, if the combined capacity of all power plants
</p>
<p>is insufficient to cover demand as in the case of point B at the capacity limit, the
</p>
<p>market-clearing price spikes, exceeding marginal cost by ( p3 � p2). This difference
is the so-called capacity rent, reflected by a capacity surcharge.
</p>
<p>If the situation depicted by point B occurs frequently, investment in generation
</p>
<p>capacity is stimulated, as discussed in Sect. 12.3.2. Note that while at point B of
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.9 the price exceeds marginal cost of any plant in the merit order, it is not the
</p>
<p>result of market power. In liberalized markets the wholesale power price can&mdash;and
</p>
<p>must from time to time&mdash;exceed marginal cost. In these situations, the regulator
</p>
<p>may come under public pressure to intervene, with the consequence that the
</p>
<p>electricity market on its own (so-called &ldquo;energy only market&rdquo;) is unable to generate
</p>
<p>sufficient revenues for financing investment in capacity. To correct this failure
</p>
<p>(often referred to as &ldquo;missing money problem&rdquo;), capacity payments to power
</p>
<p>generators may be introduced, which may be financed by a general electricity levy.
</p>
<p>However, a decentralized design is possible for a capacity market as well in the
</p>
<p>following way. Retailers and eligible industrial customers are mandated to hold
</p>
<p>capacity certificates if they wish to purchase peak load electricity at the wholesale
</p>
<p>market price. The supply side comprises generators, customers with interruptible
</p>
<p>loads, and owners of electricity storage devices. The capacity price is high if
</p>
<p>capacities are hardly sufficient to meet demand but it can be zero in times of
</p>
<p>weak demand and excess capacity. While a decentralized capacity market requires
</p>
<p>a lot of control and supervision by the regulator, it can do without a central planner
</p>
<p>who determines the necessary capacity.
</p>
<p>In systems with a high market share of intermittent renewable energy sources,
</p>
<p>still another concept could be implemented. It is based on the choice by customers
</p>
<p>regarding their desired quality of electricity supply. Some types of contract could
</p>
<p>provide lower quality by allowing the retailer to cut supply during one or more
</p>
<p>hours per day if wind or photovoltaic electricity generation is in short supply
</p>
<p>(usually during evening hours). Contracts of this type would certainly spur
</p>
<p>innovation on the demand side. They also might well be less expensive than the
</p>
<p>holding of costly backup generation capacities.

<p>Economics of Electrical Grids 13
</p>
<p>The electrical grid connects generators and customers. Without it, no electricity
</p>
<p>market is possible. For enabling competition among generators and retailers, third
</p>
<p>party access to the electrical grid must be assured on terms that are transparent and
</p>
<p>nondiscriminatory. From an economic point of view, electrical grids represent both
</p>
<p>a natural monopoly and an essential facility. This confers a dominant market
</p>
<p>position upon vertically integrated utilities and power grid operators that may be
</p>
<p>abused. To prevent this and the concomitant welfare losses, power grids need to be
</p>
<p>regulated.
</p>
<p>Another issue is the network characteristic of the electrical grid. For reasons of
</p>
<p>economic efficiency, it links many countries on the European continent. The
</p>
<p>associated grid externalities require grid operators to provide system services
</p>
<p>according to common rules and standards, among others control power (also called
</p>
<p>regulation power) to keep demand and supply in continuous balance.
</p>
<p>This chapter addresses the following questions:
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the economic reasons motivating grid integration?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are economically efficient approaches to the provision of grid services?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are economically efficient grid tariffs?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What are the economic benefits and costs of unbundling?
</p>
<p>How should interconnectors be efficiently managed?

<p>13.1 Grid Properties and System Services
</p>
<p>13.1.1 Electrotechnical Aspects
</p>
<p>The transmission and distribution of electrical energy is carried out through
</p>
<p>integrated electrical grids. With few exceptions, power lines are in alternating
</p>
<p>current (AC) operation (in contrast to direct current (DC)). AC lines deliver
</p>
<p>three-phase current with common voltage amplitude but with a phase difference
</p>
<p>of one-third of the period by combining three wires. Therefore, the sum of the three
</p>
<p>electric currents is always zero. The direction of electron flux alternates periodi-
</p>
<p>cally with the target frequency of 50 hertz (Hz) in the European power grid with a
</p>
<p>tolerance of�0.15 Hz. In an interconnected AC grid, frequencies are synchronized,
resulting in uniform oscillation.
</p>
<p>Depending on the voltage level of the power line, one distinguishes between:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Extra-high voltage grid (220,000&ndash;380,000 V) for long distance transmission;
</p>
<p>&ndash; High-voltage grid (35,000&ndash;10,000 V) for interregional transmission;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Mid-voltage grid (1000&ndash;30,000 V) for regional distribution;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Low-voltage grid (220&ndash;380 V) for local distribution.
</p>
<p>Since transmission and distribution entails losses that increase with distance, it is
</p>
<p>efficient to site generation as closely as possible to the point of use electricity.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the average transmission distance of electricity is below 100 km, with the
</p>
<p>consequence that transmission and distribution losses are below 5% of delivered
</p>
<p>electricity, the major part occurring in the low-voltage grid (see Table 13.1).
</p>
<p>However, according to Ohm&rsquo;s law, loss is inversely related to voltage, making
</p>
<p>long-distance transmission through extra-high voltage lines economically more
</p>
<p>viable.
</p>
<p>Neglecting the use of electrical grids for telecommunication, power grids are
</p>
<p>factor-specific assets, meaning that they are exclusively used for delivering electric
</p>
<p>power from generators to consumers. Many types of infrastructure such as gas
</p>
<p>grids, water pipes, and railways are factor-specific assets. However, the electrical
</p>
<p>grid has a particularity which sets it apart from all other such assets: The current
</p>
<p>flow cannot be limited to one line of the grid. According to Kirchhoff&rsquo;s laws, the
</p>
<p>298 13 Economics of Electrical Grids</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>current flow along a single line of a network depends on its electric resistance
</p>
<p>relative to all other paths that connect points of entry and exit. Thus electric currents
</p>
<p>always use all lines of an integrated network regardless of who owns them.
</p>
<p>Individual power lines can be separated from the grid for repair or to prevent
</p>
<p>damage from overload, but from an economic point of view, the integrated electri-
</p>
<p>cal grid is an indivisible good.
</p>
<p>At the end of nineteenth century, electricity was initially supplied in local
</p>
<p>insulars. While the technical feasibility of long-distance power transmission was
</p>
<p>demonstrated in the 1880s, it took until in the 1920s and 1930s for nationwide
</p>
<p>electrical grids to develop in the United States and Europe. This development was
</p>
<p>fostered by supportive &lsquo;eminent domain&rsquo; legislation weakening property rights of
</p>
<p>landowners affected by a power line. With the creation of the Union for the
</p>
<p>Coordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) in 1951 which is now the
</p>
<p>European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E),
</p>
<p>grid interconnection and synchronization spread across Europe. An integrated grid
</p>
<p>offers the following advantages in terms of economic efficiency1:
</p>
<p>&ndash; In case of power plant failures, customers can be supplied from distant power
</p>
<p>plants, permitting local providers to reduce their backup capacities. This is
</p>
<p>equivalent to an insurance-like pooling effect.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The aggregation of regional load profiles results in a more uniform load,
</p>
<p>enabling power plants to operate more regularly. This is a positive externality,
</p>
<p>the so-called network externality (David 1987).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Power plants that supply larger volumes thanks to enlarged service can be scaled
</p>
<p>up, resulting in lower unit cost of generation (economies of scale). However,
</p>
<p>recent technological change seems to have diminished scale economies in
</p>
<p>generation (Thompson and Wolf 1987), modifying the relative economic benefit
</p>
<p>of integrated power grids.

<p>1The high-voltage networks in Europe are typically designed according to the n�1 criterion. This
means that supply of all customers is still ensured, provided that a single resource (power plant,
</p>
<p>power line, transformer station) has failed.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ndash; On the other hand, the development of offshore wind and other location-specific
</p>
<p>generation capacities has led to a renaissance of integrated power grids, with
</p>
<p>high-voltage direct current (HVDC) technology being used for reducing trans-
</p>
<p>mission losses in long-distance transmission.
</p>
<p>Without access to the grid, no independent power producer can deliver electric-
</p>
<p>ity to customers and no retail customer can shift to a more efficient supplier.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the key condition for liberalization of electricity markets (see Sect.
</p>
<p>12.2) is mandatory third party access to the grid on transparent and
</p>
<p>discrimination-free terms. Beginning in the 1990s, this condition was satisfied in
</p>
<p>several industrial countries.
</p>
<p>13.1.2 Services to Be Provided by Electrical Grid Operators
</p>
<p>When a customer purchases power from another generator rather than from the
</p>
<p>local utility, the electricity always comes from the nearest power plant connected to
</p>
<p>the grid. Currents in the integrated grid change only if generators lose (gain,
</p>
<p>respectively) customers, causing them to reduce (increase) generation. This is a
</p>
<p>consequence of non-storability (see Sect. 12.1.2). Similar requirements hold for
</p>
<p>retailers and eligible industrial customers with access to the wholesale power
</p>
<p>market who are expected to draw exactly the amount of electricity from the grid
</p>
<p>as contracted with their supplier. The electricity market is in equilibrium if all
</p>
<p>purchasing contracts are executable with the grid transmission and distribution
</p>
<p>capacities available.
</p>
<p>In Europe, the synchronized integrated grid is divided into control areas where a
</p>
<p>single transmission system operator (TSO) has the responsibility for reliable and
</p>
<p>secure grid operation. A high quality of supply requires that all TSOs meet the
</p>
<p>technical rules and standards set up by the European Network of Transmission
</p>
<p>System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E).
</p>
<p>Each TSO needs information to perform this task, which comes from retailers
</p>
<p>and eligible customers (also balancing group managers) who seek access to the
</p>
<p>grid. The data to be provided one day ahead comprise planned aggregate volumes of
</p>
<p>electricity fed into and withdrawn from all grid connecting points in their respective
</p>
<p>control areas. They typically cover for time intervals no longer than 15 min (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 3.6.3).
</p>
<p>Based on this information, the TSO is obliged to provide the following services2:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Frequency control (secured by so-called spinning reserve and control power);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Voltage control (secured by compensating so-called reactive power);
</p>
<p>2In some countries, the transmission operator is only responsible for the high and extra-high-
</p>
<p>voltage grid, whereas the mid and low-voltage power grids are controlled by distribution system
</p>
<p>operators (DSO).

<p>&ndash; Black-start capacities for grid restoration after blackouts (secured by contracts

<p>with suitable generators);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Compensation for transmission losses (which can be substantial in wholesale
</p>
<p>electricity purchases);
</p>
<p>&ndash; Redispatch of generators in case of congested grid lines3;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Cross-border interconnection management;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Balancing fluctuations in the supply of electricity produced from renewable
</p>
<p>sources (if required by the regulator).
</p>
<p>While conventional power stations are mostly connected to the high-voltage grid
</p>
<p>controlled by the TSO, most of the distributed generation capacities are connected
</p>
<p>to mid- and low-voltage networks controlled by distribution system operators
</p>
<p>(DSOs). The DSO secures stable operation of the distribution grid, in particular
</p>
<p>voltage control. Grids of this type are not designed for large-scale transmission.
</p>
<p>They may even become obsolete with the implementation of smart grids.
</p>
<p>13.1.3 Markets for Control Power
</p>
<p>Due to the non-storability of electricity in the electrical grid, demand and supply for
</p>
<p>power must be equal within each control area. However, due to stochastic demand
</p>
<p>and supply fluctuations, permanent divergences between them occur that must be
</p>
<p>balanced by a system operator (TSO or ISO). Unexpected fluctuations arise both on
</p>
<p>the demand side (e.g. due to meteorological conditions) and supply side (e.g. power
</p>
<p>plant outages). The resulting imbalances can be recognized by deviations from the
</p>
<p>target frequency of 50 Hz (in Europe). Excess demand causes frequency to drop
</p>
<p>below 50 Hz, indicating that a positive amount of balancing power is needed.
</p>
<p>Excess supply causes it to rise above 50 Hz, calling for a negative amount of
</p>
<p>balancing power.
</p>
<p>In Europe, the TSO has the obligation to provide balancing power to grid users
</p>
<p>which it procures on transparent and competitive markets for control power (also
</p>
<p>called regulation power); see Fig. 13.1. The TSO calls for combined tenders,
</p>
<p>specifying both volume and price, at given intervals. Control power is assured by
</p>
<p>three levels of reserve capacity:
</p>
<p>&ndash; The primary reserve (historically also known as spinning reserve), which is
</p>
<p>automatically activated within 15 s and delivered simultaneously by committed
</p>
<p>suppliers. These suppliers are compensated for the capacity that must be avail-
</p>
<p>able for both upward and downward regulation.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The secondary reserve must be available within 30 s to 5 min. Auctions for it are
</p>
<p>multivariate because suppliers offer prices for both capacity (availability) and
</p>
<p>3Redispatch means to change the power plant schedule by reducing generation in front of and
</p>
<p>increasing generation behind a grid congestion.
</p>
<p>13.1 Grid Properties and System Services 301</p>
<p/>

<p>energy (work). Eventually, bids with the lowest prices for capacity are selected.
</p>
<p>Suppliers are activated by the TSO following the merit order based on the
</p>
<p>contracted prices for energy. A distinction (also in terms of prices) is made
</p>
<p>between positive and negative regulation power.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The tertiary reserve (also called minute reserve) is used to substitute secondary
</p>
<p>reserves when necessary. It must be available within 15 min upon request of the
</p>
<p>TSO and is remunerated in a similar fashion as the secondary reserve. Again, a
</p>
<p>distinction between upward and downward capacities is made.
</p>
<p>Prices for both capacity and energy are based on the pay-as-bid principle rather
</p>
<p>than according to the highest accepted bid (uniform pricing) as in the day-ahead
</p>
<p>market (see Sect. 12.2.2).
</p>
<p>The procurement of balancing power entails additional cost of capacity and
</p>
<p>energy. The cost of capacity is charged to customers as a flat transmission grid fee.
</p>
<p>The cost of energy delivered is assigned to the parties seeking access (in the guise of
</p>
<p>so-called balancing groups) according to their individual discrepancies between
</p>
<p>registered and realized power (see Sect. 3.6.3). The energy cost depends on the total
</p>
<p>amount of balancing energy needed which corresponds to the sum of all
</p>
<p>discrepancies (with correct signs). The price of balancing energy is constant and
</p>
<p>equal to the average price of control energy supplied to the TSO with a time interval
</p>
<p>for pricing of 15 min (real-time pricing). There are no price spreads between
</p>
<p>positive and negative deviations. If this price is positive, balancing groups who
</p>
<p>exhibit net excess energy receive this price for supplying it, while parties who show
</p>
<p>net deficits have to pay this price.
</p>
<p>13.2 Regulation of Grid Fees
</p>
<p>In view of Kirchhoff&rsquo;s law, users of the grid lack control over the route electricity
</p>
<p>takes in the grid. Thus, the relevant concept is the extra cost caused by admitting an
</p>
<p>extra MW for transmission regardless of points of entry and exit. Grid fees based on
</p>
<p>this concept evidently facilitate competition among generators and have been
</p>
<p>favored by the European Union for this reason. In addition, the EC Directive
</p>
<p>2003/54/EG on the single European electricity market establishes that access fees
</p>
<p>may be charged on the exit side, not on the entry side of the grid. Consequently,
</p>
<p>power consumers are charged for access to the grid according to the voltage level,

</p>
<p>levels. These fees are collected by the distribution grid operator, who transfers them
</p>
<p>to the respective operators managing the higher-level grids.
</p>
<p>13.2.1 The Grid as an Essential Facility
</p>
<p>The electrical grid is a natural monopoly, which means that the cost function that
</p>
<p>links transmission and distribution expenditure to quantity transmitted is
</p>
<p>sub-additive. Sub-additivity implies that combining grid assets of K system
</p>
<p>operators with transmission Qk and costs C(Qk) respectively reduces the overall
</p>
<p>cost of supply, i.e.
</p>
<p>C

</p>
<p>C Qi&eth; &THORN;: &eth;13:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>Given a natural monopoly, it is therefore cost-effective to merge transmission
</p>
<p>units of a common region to become a single unit rather than having two or more
</p>
<p>separate companies compete with their grids. A sufficient (but not necessary)
</p>
<p>condition for a natural monopoly is that average cost be below marginal cost.
</p>
<p>This condition holds for power grids, at least given the current state of technology.
</p>
<p>Artificially injecting competition into the transmission and distribution industries is
</p>
<p>also near impossible because of high barriers to entry for newcomers especially in
</p>
<p>countries with already sufficient transmission and distribution capacities.
</p>
<p>In addition, an electrical grid also constitutes an essential facility. Without it,
</p>
<p>generators cannot supply their customers unless they are located right next to the
</p>
<p>power plant. This gives vertically integrated utilities and power grid operators a
</p>
<p>dominant market position, which they may abuse by denying independent power
</p>
<p>producers access to the grid or charging them excessive fees. The result is an
</p>
<p>artificial limitation of supply that causes a welfare loss (see also Sect. 1.2.2). For
</p>
<p>this reason power grid operators must be regulated. The economic theory of
</p>
<p>regulation provides concepts and models for governments who seek to set access
</p>
<p>fees for grids in an optimal way.
</p>
<p>13.2.2 Optimal Grid Fees
</p>
<p>In the interest of welfare maximization, the price for access to a network should be
</p>
<p>equal to marginal cost, the so-called first-best solution. The regulator may be
</p>
<p>tempted to impose marginal cost-pricing. But the grid being a natural monopoly,
</p>
<p>its marginal cost is below average cost. Therefore, a price equal to marginal cost
</p>
<p>fails to generate enough revenue to recover total cost (see point A in Fig. 13.2). In
</p>
<p>this case, public regulation needs to find a second-best solution (Demsetz 1968).
</p>
<p>13.2 Regulation of Grid Fees 303</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_1">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53022-1_1</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The classical proposal is to let the monopolistic network operator charge a price
</p>
<p>that covers average cost, including an appropriate return on the capital employed
</p>
<p>(so-called cost-plus regulation). However, this solution is problematic. Frist, since
</p>
<p>price depends on average cost, incentives to minimize cost are undermined. Second,
</p>
<p>there is a welfare loss because some customers who are willing to pay a price in
</p>
<p>excess of marginal cost are not served (those with a demand between points A and
</p>
<p>B of Fig. 13.2).
</p>
<p>Both of these concerns are addressed by a split tariff, which amounts to price
</p>
<p>discrimination according to marginal willingness to pay (WTP):
</p>
<p>&ndash; Customers with marginal WTP in excess of average cost cavg pay a price equal
</p>
<p>to cavg;
</p>
<p>&ndash; Customers with a marginal WTP between marginal cost cmc and average cost
</p>
<p>cavg pay a price equal to cmc.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the split tariff ensures that all customers whose willingness to pay is
</p>
<p>sufficient to cover the marginal cost of service are served. The utility breaks even
</p>
<p>since up to point B, its average cost is covered by the revenue obtained from
</p>
<p>costumers with high willingness to pay, whereas the extra quantity provided
</p>
<p>between points B and A is priced in a way to recover the additional cost.
</p>
<p>Obviously, identifying customers with high marginal WTP is difficult. In addi-
</p>
<p>tion, actually using this information for pricing is prohibited by the European
</p>
<p>directive on the common market for electricity (European Commission 2009a, b),
</p>
<p>which stipulates discrimination-free and transparent access to the grid. By
</p>
<p>prohibiting any kind of price discrimination in the use of grids, it in fact makes
</p>
<p>the introduction of split tariffs impossible.
</p>
<p>Another approach is the two-part tariff:
</p>
<p>&ndash; The first part of the tariff makes all costumers pay a price equal to the marginal
</p>
<p>cost of transmitting or distributing electricity. It preserves incentives for

<p>efficiency because by lowering marginal cost, the network operator can generate
</p>
<p>more profit.
</p>
<p>&ndash; The second part of the tariff makes up for the shortfall in revenue. It is a separate
</p>
<p>price for access to the grid, which transfers part of the consumer surplus (given
</p>
<p>by the area below the demand function but above the marginal cost function) to
</p>
<p>the network operator. This part of the tariff is tricky because the network
</p>
<p>operator has a clear interest in appropriating as much consumer surplus as
</p>
<p>possible, beyond the amount necessary to break even. Moreover, the break-
</p>
<p>even point itself depends on the location of the average cost function, which is
</p>
<p>under the operator&rsquo;s control. Finally, consumers have a weakened incentive to
</p>
<p>invest in energy efficiency because the capacity fee does not depend on their
</p>
<p>consumption.
</p>
<p>Yet several customers may use the same grid capacity if they do not call on it
</p>
<p>during the same period (see Sect. 12.3.1). To account for this, the capacity ordered
</p>
<p>is multiplied by a simultaneity factor 0 &lt; g(h) &lt; 1, which is a function that
</p>
<p>increases with the so-called annual usage time h.4 Annual usage time is an indicator
</p>
<p>of the probability that a grid customer orders grid capacity at peak load time. An
</p>
<p>example of such a function is

</p>
<p>&eth;13:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>A distinction can be made between off-peak and peak usage of the grid.
</p>
<p>Therefore, grid companies can be regarded as monopolistic companies with k &frac14; 2
products or segments. In order to avoid arbitrary allocation of cost between the two
</p>
<p>segments, regulators may use the Ramsey pricing model. This model calculates a
</p>

</p>
<p>According to Eq. (13.9), the Ramsey price contains a surcharge over marginal
</p>
<p>cost. It increases with λ, the so-called shadow price of a constraint, in the present
</p>
<p>case constraint (13.4) that ensures the recovery of total cost. Furthermore, the
</p>
<p>surcharge decreases with the absolute value of the own price elasticity of demand
</p>
<p>ηi. If customers in a particular market segment respond strongly to an increase in the
</p>
<p>grid fee (as is typical for off-peak customers) a surcharge over marginal cost entails
</p>
<p>a large welfare loss. On the other hand, there are market segments where the price
</p>
<p>elasticity is low (typically peak customers). Following the optimality condition,
</p>
<p>306 13 Economics of Electrical Grids</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>these customers should bear a larger proportion of the grid cost than off-peak
</p>
<p>customers.
</p>
<p>For the practical application of Ramsey pricing, regulators need to have detailed
</p>
<p>knowledge of the current cost of the grid (backward-looking) as well as the future
</p>
<p>cost associated with efficient grid services (forward-looking). A large number of
</p>
<p>operational and economic parameters must be assessed as well:
</p>
<p>&ndash; How much physical (and hence financial) capital is required for efficient opera-
</p>
<p>tion of the grid?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What standards of quality (e.g. interruption duration) must the grid operator
</p>
<p>guarantee?
</p>
<p>&ndash; Is the network operator to be allowed to include the cost of future expansions of
</p>
<p>the grid in the fee?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What method of depreciation is to be applied to grid assets (e.g. procurement
</p>
<p>cost or replacement cost)?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What is the so-called rate base, i.e. the allowable share of equity?
</p>
<p>&ndash; What is the allowable rate of return on equity?
</p>
<p>There is the definite possibility that the regulator answers these questions in a
</p>
<p>way that conflicts with the assessment of the grid operator. In the case of private
</p>
<p>grid ownership, the specifications of the regulator in fact determine the company&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>decision to invest, blurring the division of responsibilities between the two. Even-
</p>
<p>tually, the result may be a nationalization of electrical grids because it vests
</p>
<p>managerial responsibility unambiguously with the government. However, such a
</p>
<p>decision will always entail long-term consequences for economic efficiency.
</p>
<p>13.2.3 Incentive Regulation
</p>
<p>Another critical issue of all public regulation is the asymmetry of information
</p>
<p>between regulator and the regulated firm (the grid operator in the present context).
</p>
<p>Grid operators have detailed knowledge concerning potential for efficiency
</p>
<p>improvement and tendencies in demand that is unavailable to regulators. This is
</p>
<p>an instance of the principal-agent problem, where a principal lacks the information
</p>
<p>for controlling the agent&rsquo;s effort, who can therefore pursue its own interests. All the
</p>
<p>principal can do in this situation is to structure the contract in a way as to provide
</p>
<p>the best possible incentives to the agent, at least in expected value. In the present
</p>
<p>context, grid operators may use their informational advantage to obtain grid fees in
</p>
<p>excess of the level justified by minimum cost regardless of the regulation method
</p>
<p>chosen:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Under rate-of-return regulation (also known as cost-plus or markup regulation),
</p>
<p>grid operators are granted a fixed markup on proven cost. This type of regulation
</p>
<p>creates an incentive to increase cost, notably by employing capital in excess of
</p>
<p>13.2 Regulation of Grid Fees 307</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the economically efficient amount. This is the so-called Averch-Johnson effect
</p>
<p>(see Averch and Johnson 1962).
</p>
<p>&ndash; Under price-cap regulation, the regulator sets a maximum grid fee. In this case,
</p>
<p>the incentive is to increase profit by reducing investment. Therefore, price-cap
</p>
<p>regulation results in underinvestment, thus hurting grid reliability in the
</p>
<p>long term.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Under revenue-cap regulation, the regulator sets the maximum revenue.
</p>
<p>Revenue-cap regulation gives rise to an incentive to increase profit by
</p>
<p>minimizing costly grid services.
</p>
<p>Whatever the approach of the regulator, its objectives may fail to be achieved,
</p>
<p>notably economically efficient and reliable grid operation. The popular response to
</p>
<p>this failure is tighter control and increased sanctions. However, such a response
</p>
<p>often is not helpful because supervision and compliance are not without cost
</p>
<p>themselves, resulting in an increase in the macroeconomic cost of electrical grids.
</p>
<p>This dilemma has spawned the concept of incentive regulation, which was
</p>
<p>developed by Stephen Littlechild, who later became the first regulator of the electric
</p>
<p>industry in the United Kingdom (see Beesley and Littlechild 1989; Laffont and
</p>
<p>Tirole 1993, Chap. 4). According to this concept, regulation should be compatible
</p>
<p>with the incentives of the regulated firm. Applied to grid operators, it calls for
</p>
<p>letting them earn higher profits for a few years if they increase efficiency more than
</p>
<p>required by the regulator. After this grace period, however, they must pass the
</p>
<p>benefits from efficiency gains to their customers in the form of lower fees.
</p>
<p>Incentive regulation determines the time path of a selected indicator,
</p>
<p>e.g. maximum allowable sales revenues SR, in the following way during a specified
</p>
<p>period,
</p>
<p>SRt � SRt�1 � 1&thorn; RPIt�1 � Xgeneral &thorn; Xindividual
� �
</p>
<p>: &eth;13:10&THORN;
</p>
<p>In this formula, RPIt-1 denotes the percentage change in the index of retail prices
</p>
<p>over the previous period, Xgeneral, a required rate of productivity increase, calcu-
</p>
<p>lated over all grid operators, and Xindividual, a required rate of productivity increase,
</p>
<p>applied to an individual grid operator.
</p>
<p>According to Eq. (13.10), an operator&rsquo;s revenue may increase with the general
</p>
<p>rate of inflation. There are two extensions, however. The first is a deduction
</p>
<p>reflecting the rate of productivity increase in the industry. The second is designed
</p>
<p>to raise the bar for grid operators who have been lagging behind, forcing them to
</p>
<p>catch up with the rest. Conversely, grid operators who improve productivity
</p>
<p>Xindividual by more than Xgeneral can benefit from an increase of their allowable
</p>
<p>revenue, permitting them to earn higher profits. In this way, incentive regulation
</p>
<p>seeks to conserve incentives for dynamic productivity improvement. Grid operators
</p>
<p>can retain excessive profits, but only temporarily because the regulator adjusts the
</p>
<p>formula (13.10) at the end of a specified period. At that point, costs and profits are
</p>
<p>examined, which are (close to) their true values, providing information that would
</p>
<p>usually not be accessible to regulators.
</p>
<p>308 13 Economics of Electrical Grids</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In practice, this approach suffers from its exclusive focus on cost-efficiency.
</p>
<p>Reliability and other quality dimensions of supply aspects are not considered.
</p>
<p>Security of supply is defined here as the capability of the power transmission and
</p>
<p>distribution system to continuously maintain the flow of electricity in case of
</p>
<p>unforeseen disruptions. To account for this aspect, the incentive regulation formula
</p>
<p>(13.10) can be extended to include a bonus for high-quality grid operation which is
</p>
<p>usually based on the value of lost load (see Praktiknjo 2013). An indicator of quality
</p>
<p>is the predicted number of grid customers that can still be supplied if one element of
</p>
<p>the grid (e.g. power line, transformer, control room) fails (this constitutes the
</p>
<p>so-called n�1 criterion). Rather than this ex-ante indicator, most regulators use
ex-post indicators. These include
</p>
<p>&ndash; SAIDI: System Average Interruption Duration Index;
</p>
<p>&ndash; SAIFI: System Average Interruption Frequency Index;
</p>
<p>&ndash; CAIDI: Customer Average Interruption Duration Index.
</p>
<p>Usually, these indicators reflect quality deficits only with a time lag. While
</p>
<p>insufficient maintenance reduces cost immediately, the quality of grid services
</p>
<p>deteriorates only in the medium term. Conversely, expenditure on investment and
</p>
<p>maintenance increases grid cost instantly but has a positive effect on quality with
</p>
<p>a lag.
</p>
<p>13.2.4 Unbundling
</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;unbundling&rsquo; means undoing the vertical integration that has been
</p>
<p>characterizing the electric power industry for the past century. Its objective is to
</p>
<p>open up the market to competition between generators and to traders who are
</p>
<p>independent of both generators and distributors. However, pursuing this objective
</p>
<p>through unbundling is not without opportunity cost because the efficiency
</p>
<p>advantages of vertical integration mentioned in Sect. 12.1.3 are lost. Nevertheless,
</p>
<p>the EU Directive 2009/72/EC (European Commission 2009a) stipulates that large
</p>
<p>utilities must be at least legally unbundled, resulting in independent business units
</p>
<p>for generation, transmission, and distribution (see Table 13.2). For the time being,
</p>
<p>unbundling in terms of ownership is not required. Alternatively, grid ownership can
</p>
<p>remain within the integrated company, in return, operation of the transmission
</p>
<p>network is to be transferred to an independent system operator (ISO).
</p>
<p>An example of the unbundling of the grid is the PJM (Pennsylvania&mdash;New
</p>
<p>Jersey&mdash;Maryland Interconnection) market in the northeastern United States,
</p>
<p>which serves an area of 13 states with 51 mn grid customers. In addition to
</p>
<p>providing the usual grid services, an independent system operator (ISO) determines
</p>
<p>transmission prices at each node where power can be fed in and taken out (so-called
</p>
<p>nodal pricing). Every 5 min and at every node (approaching a real-time market), the
</p>
<p>locational price is determined by the marginal cost of the last power plant which has
</p>
<p>to be connected to the grid in order to cover the load forecasted by the ISO without

<p>violating any grid restrictions. Furthermore, the ISO performs the economically
</p>
<p>efficient dispatching of power plants using data such as maximum power gradient
</p>
<p>(i.e. the speed with which the plant can be brought up to required output), minimum
</p>
<p>uptime and downtime, and start-up and shut-down cost. Power plant operators act
</p>
<p>according to the price signaled by the ISO, which reflects the shadow price (i.e. the
</p>
<p>value of the Lagrangian multiplier) pertaining to the constraint,
</p>
<p>Generation &frac14; Load: &eth;13:11&THORN;
</p>
<p>This shadow price is part of the solution of an optimization problem. Power plant
</p>
<p>operators are free to not respond to this price signal, speculating to be able to extract
</p>
<p>higher capacity prices in a later period. The price signaling activities of the ISO are
</p>
<p>financed in analogy to the market for balancing power in Europe (see discussion in
</p>
<p>Sect. 13.1.3).
</p>
<p>13.3 Economic Approach to Transmission Bottlenecks
</p>
<p>According to Kirchhoff&rsquo;s laws, the transmission of electricity between a generator
</p>
<p>and a so-called load sink uses all available routes. This can lead to loop flows across
</p>
<p>linked control areas of a grid, giving rise to congestion. As a result, intended trades
</p>
<p>cannot be executed simultaneously, forcing the (independent or transmission)
</p>
<p>system operator (ISO or TSO, respectively) to modify individual delivery
</p>
<p>schedules.
</p>
<p>The left-hand side of Fig. 13.3 illustrates such a situation. A generator (indicated
</p>
<p>at the top left) seeks to transmit 8 MW to a customer (indicated at the bottom left).
</p>
<p>The direct connection (dashed) has a capacity of 4 MW only. However, the

<p>intended transmission would trigger a power flow of 5 MW in the dashed line,
</p>
<p>resulting in system failure.
</p>
<p>The system operator (ISO or TSO) can avoid congestion in this example, by
</p>
<p>ordering an additional delivery between two indirectly affected grid nodes (see
</p>
<p>right-hand side of Fig. 13.3). The additional delivery of 16 MW creates an indirect
</p>
<p>counterflow of 1 MW on the congested line. As a consequence, the net demand
</p>
<p>placed on this link is reduced to 4 MW, equal to its capacity.
</p>
<p>This is but one of several options for dealing with grid bottlenecks. Other options
</p>
<p>are the following.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Rationing: This amounts to capping the amount of power that can be transmitted
</p>
<p>during a given period. If rationing is imposed frequently, grid customers begin to
</p>
<p>weigh the value of lost load caused by it against the value of purchasing and
</p>
<p>operating emergency backup units. They cannot be expected to undertake the
</p>
<p>investment for the elimination of a notorious network bottleneck themselves.
</p>
<p>Such an investment would benefit all other grid customers, creating a positive
</p>
<p>external effect. Therefore, this is up to the grid operator, who can be induced by
</p>
<p>the regulator to initiate the necessary investment e.g. by granting increased grid
</p>
<p>fees.5
</p>
<p>&ndash; Explicit auctioning of temporal capacity rights on critical segments of the grid
</p>
<p>(see Hogan 1993): A company who has acquired capacity rights is allowed but
</p>
<p>not required to use these rights at its discretion. This gives it potential for abuse
</p>
<p>by not exercising them, thus blocking transmission by competitors. In this way,

</p>
<p>13.3 Economic Approach to Transmission Bottlenecks 311</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>regional market areas can be insulated from international competition. A solu-
</p>
<p>tion to this problem is for the grid operator to be able to withdraw capacity rights
</p>
<p>from non-users, applying the principle &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo;. The elimination of grid
</p>
<p>bottlenecks could in principle be financed using the proceeds of these auctions.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Implicit auctioning of capacity rights: In the absence of a grid bottleneck
</p>
<p>between two market areas, price differences between them can be removed by
</p>
<p>merging the two (so-called market coupling). If the local power exchanges
</p>
<p>cooperate, demand in the more expensive area can in part be met by supply
</p>
<p>from the low-cost market area until the price difference disappears. However,
</p>
<p>grid capacity between the two market areas may not be sufficient for price
</p>
<p>equalization. In this case, the participating power exchanges may aim at maxi-
</p>
<p>mum possible price equalization by ensuring that power flows from the
</p>
<p>low-price area to the high-price one.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Market splitting (nodal pricing): Grid bottlenecks may also occur within a single
</p>
<p>control area. They can be overcome by temporarily dividing the control area into
</p>
<p>separate market areas and ensuring that each of them has market prices that
</p>
<p>balance regional demand and supply. In the area with a high market price,
</p>
<p>customers pay a surcharge on the price that would prevail if the control area
</p>
<p>were integrated. This constitutes extra revenue for the generators. Conversely,
</p>
<p>customers in the area with a low market price benefit from a low price, while
</p>
<p>generators achieve less revenue. Eventually, the price differences incentivize
</p>
<p>investment in generation capacity in the high-cost area and investment in grid
</p>
<p>capacity between the low-cost and high-cost region, both alleviating future
</p>
<p>congestions. This model has been implemented in Scandinavia for years, ensur-
</p>
<p>ing that bottlenecks are managed efficiently by Nord Pool, the Scandinavian
</p>
<p>power exchange.
</p>
<p>Implicit auctioning and market splitting make efficient handling of grid
</p>
<p>bottlenecks possible, suggesting that they are likely to become more common in
</p>
<p>future. However, they too fail to provide an answer to the question of how to create
</p>
<p>economic incentives for completely eliminating grid bottlenecks. In principle, a
</p>
<p>grid bottleneck hurts economic efficiency if investment in its removal is less costly
</p>
<p>than the present value of the price differences caused by it. As a result, grid
</p>
<p>operators have usually no reason to make such an investment (eliminating price
</p>
<p>differences and thus potential for arbitrage activities) unless the regulator provides
</p>
<p>them with appropriate incentives (e.g. granting a higher return on equity or
</p>
<p>exemptions from regulation imposing nondiscriminatory access to the grid).

<p>Epilogue 14
</p>
<p>While Chaps. 1&ndash;7 are dedicated to overarching issues and systemic relationships,
</p>
<p>Chaps. 8&ndash;13 of this book turn to the individual markets for energy. Starting from the
</p>
<p>pertinent constraints imposed by the laws of science and engineering, the
</p>
<p>discussions revolve around respective costs, supply and demand, forms of compe-
</p>
<p>tition, and resulting prices, taking account of peculiarities that shape consumer
</p>
<p>preferences. In an attempt to keep the analysis reasonably simple, the existence of
</p>
<p>the respective other markets and prices prevailing on them have been taken as
</p>
<p>given, thus abstracting from the interdependencies between the several energy
</p>
<p>markets. In addition, the question why politicians want to see certain market
</p>
<p>outcomes rather than others, e.g. by subsidizing renewables or prohibiting the use
</p>
<p>of fracking technologies, remains mainly unanswered.1 In that sense, energy policy
</p>
<p>is outside the scope of this book.
</p>
<p>This is not to deny that energy markets are very much influenced by policy. This
</p>
<p>becomes particularly apparent when considering the call formulated at several
</p>
<p>international conferences and summits to practically cease all greenhouse gas
</p>
<p>emissions by the middle of this century. Yet the implementation of this call
</p>
<p>would have consequences for energy markets of a magnitude exceeding anything
</p>
<p>observed during the past 100 years&mdash;a period certainly not devoid of turmoil
</p>
<p>concerning energy.
</p>
<p>Using some of the insights obtained in this book, it may be worthwhile to
</p>
<p>speculate on what a future decarbonized energy system might look like. One
</p>
<p>possibility is technological change with a focus on electricity with renewable
</p>
<p>fuels, short- and long-term storage of power, and its transmission between
</p>
<p>continents. Developments of this type would foster the use of electricity in markets
</p>
<p>that up to now have been relying on fossil energy sources, be they solid, liquid, or
</p>
<p>1Answers to this question would require a good deal of so-called public choice theory, a branch of
</p>
<p>economics that analyzes the behavior of voters, politicians, and public officials (see e.g. Buchanan
</p>
<p>and Tullock 1962).

<p>gaseous. The expanded use of electricity need not be direct, in the guise e.g. of
</p>
<p>battery-powered vehicles or heat pumps. Rather, it might also be indirect, through a
</p>
<p>transformation of renewable electricity into other final energy sources (known as
</p>
<p>sector coupling, e.g. power-to-heat, power-to-gas, and power-to-liquid). The advan-
</p>
<p>tage of this scenario is that at least part of the existing infrastructure can be used in
</p>
<p>future.
</p>
<p>Another alternative is to substitute fossil energy sources by derivatives of
</p>
<p>biomass. However, this would call for the development of new technologies
</p>
<p>designed to reduce land requirements. Otherwise, competition between &lsquo;biomass
</p>
<p>for energy&rsquo; and &lsquo;biomass for food&rsquo; is likely to render this solution to the greenhouse
</p>
<p>gas problem unacceptable. Another option is carbon capture and storage (CCS) and
</p>
<p>carbon capture and use (CCU). In both cases, the carbon dioxide (CO2) released is
</p>
<p>filtered from the gases associated with the combustion of fossil fuels. Obviously,
</p>
<p>CCS and CCU make sense only if the release of CO2 into the atmosphere can be
</p>
<p>permanently prevented. The CCS technology amounts to the use of suitable geo-
</p>
<p>logical formations for this purpose. However, available capacities are likely to fall
</p>
<p>short of the quantities of CO2 that have been accumulating during decades. In
</p>
<p>response to this challenge, ongoing research is focusing on CCU technologies,
</p>
<p>which enable CO2 to be stored in e.g. cement and other building materials.
</p>
<p>Evidently, for CCU to contribute to climate protection, the quantities of CO2 usable
</p>
<p>in the production of these materials must be huge.
</p>
<p>Whether or not the aim of an emission-free energy industry can be attained in the
</p>
<p>foreseeable future also depends on the decisions taken by the international climate
</p>
<p>conferences and summits. However, at the time being an agreement implementing
</p>
<p>the most efficient instrument (from an economic perspective) appears to be beyond
</p>
<p>reach: a global, nondiscriminatory CO2 tax. In the short term, such an internaliza-
</p>
<p>tion tax is apt to trigger low-cost avoidance efforts, notably directed at improving
</p>
<p>energy efficiency and the substitution of coal by natural gas. Yet for attaining the
</p>
<p>objective of climate neutrality, the long-term impacts of a CO2 tax are even more
</p>
<p>important. By credibly committing to it, the international community would create
</p>
<p>incentives to invest in innovation that brings about climate neutrality.2
</p>
<p>To attain the goal of climate neutrality, breakthrough innovations in one or
</p>
<p>several of the fields cited above need to occur within a rather short period of
</p>
<p>time. However, one should abstain from trying to identify the one innovation that
</p>
<p>will win this technology race based on the current state of knowledge.3 Historical
</p>
<p>experience suggests that a mix of innovations is likely to emerge. Following the
</p>
<p>portfolio theory developed by Markowitz (1952) expounded in Sect. 3.5.1 of this
</p>
<p>book, there might be an optimal mix of technology to achieve climate neutrality
</p>
<p>2As argued by Hayek (1960, p. 32), information about potential innovations is distributed among a
</p>
<p>multitude of agents in an economy, who moreover have an interest in keeping it to themselves
</p>
<p>rather than sharing it with a policy maker.
3The same holds for predicting with any precision the costs of realizing ambitious scenarios of
</p>
<p>climate protection within this century.

<p>from a cost-benefit perspective. However, such an assessment requires reliable data
</p>
<p>on all technologies and especially on the cost of CO2 mitigation associated with
</p>
<p>them. But evidently such data is unavailable for future innovations by definition.
</p>
<p>In sum, energy policy in general and climate policy in particular will continue to
</p>
<p>be subject to (often unpredictable) changes. Therefore, this book limits itself to the
</p>
<p>analysis of the several markets for energy and their way of functioning. Possibly,
</p>
<p>some of them may disappear altogether in future. As long as there is a need for
</p>
<p>commercial sources of energy, however, there is also a need for markets on which
</p>
<p>they can be traded. This implies that basic influences such as preferences governing
</p>
<p>demand, (marginal) costs and technological breakthroughs governing supply, their
</p>
<p>interaction governed by various degrees of competition, and politicians&rsquo;
</p>
<p>motivations for intervening in markets will not change in a fundamental way.
</p>
<p>This remains true even if elements of central planning should again supersede
</p>
<p>energy markets. One should never forget the most important message of energy
</p>
<p>economics, which is that consumers and producers will continue to pursue their
</p>
<p>own objectives!
